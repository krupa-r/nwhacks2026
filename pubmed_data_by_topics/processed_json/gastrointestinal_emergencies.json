    "title": "[A Case of Descending Colon Cancer with Splenic Abscess and Portal Venous Gas].",
    "abstract": "The patient was an 83-year-old woman who underwent surgery at our orthopedic department for a lumbar compression fracture. On the second postoperative day, she developed fever and massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding. CT imaging revealed wall thickening of the descending colon, an abscess extending from the surrounding area to the spleen, and portal venous gas. The diagnosis was perforation of the descending colon, retroperitoneal abscess, and splenic abscess, leading to emergency surgery. Intraoperative findings suggested that the descending colon had perforated into the retroperitoneal space, forming an abscess, which had penetrated the spleen, creating a fistula. A hard mass was palpable at the perforation site of the descending colon, raising suspicion of cancer. Partial colectomy with combined resection of spleen and intra- abdominal irrigation and drainage were performed. Pathological findings confirmed the diagnosis of perforation due to descending colon cancer. No obvious splenic infiltration was observed, and it was considered that gas produced by gas-producing bacteria in the splenic abscess had migrated into the portal vein. Postoperatively, the patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation(DIC), but improved with treatment. The patient was transferred to a rehabilitation facility on the 41st postoperative day. Three months postoperatively, multiple liver metastases and peritoneal metastases were detected, and palliative care was initiated at the transfer facility."

    "abstract": "We report the case of an 80-year-old man who presented with acute abdominal pain and was emergently hospitalized. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a tumor in the ascending colon with free intraperitoneal air and ascites, without evidence of distant metastasis. A diagnosis of acute generalized peritonitis due to perforation of an ascending colon tumor was made, and the patient underwent emergency surgery consisting of primary closure of the perforation and creation of a diverting ileostomy. Postoperative colonoscopy identified a tumor in the ascending colon. Histopathological examination of biopsy specimens confirmed adenocarcinoma with HER2 positivity, RAS mutation, and microsatellite instability- high(MSI-high). The clinical stage was cT4bN1bM0(duodenum), Stage Ⅲc. Pembrolizumab therapy was initiated 1 month after surgery. Progressive tumor regression was observed during treatment, and after 14 courses, colonoscopy demonstrated marked tumor shrinkage with persistent severe luminal stenosis. After 17 courses in total, laparoscopic right hemicolectomy and ileostomy closure were performed. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen showed no residual carcinoma. The histological response was classified as Grade 3 corresponding to a pathological complete response(pCR). No adjuvant chemotherapy was administered. At 5 months after the operation, the patient is alive without any recurrence. This case suggests the potential efficacy of pembrolizumab for MSI-high locally advanced colorectal cancer."

    "abstract": "A 55-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with severe anemia. The cause of anemia was hemorrhage due to the duodenal invasion of pancreatic cancer. Endoscopic hemostasis was not applicable and effect of transarterial catheter embolization was temporary. Emergency surgery was chosen as the only alternative. The tumor directly invaded the mesenterium of the transverse colon and the superior mesenteric vein(SMV)widely. Pancreaticoduodenectomy, right hemicolectomy, and resection of the SMV were performed. Concerning the both resected margins, the hepatic side was simply closed without reconstruction and the caudal side was anastomosed to the left renal vein. In the perioperative period, a diffuse bleeding occurred in the site of gastrojejunostomy and endoscopic hemostasis was done successfully. There were no complications related to modification of the SMV perfusion. The patient was discharged at the 19th postoperative day. Regardless of administration of gemcitabine as adjuvant chemotherapy, he died of developing cancerous peritonitis 3 months after the surgery. Through this experience, we would like to evaluate the significance of multidisciplinary therapy including surgery for hemorrhage due to pancreatic cancer."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal perforation during chemotherapy for gastric cancer is an infrequent but important adverse event. We report a case of ileal ulcer perforation induced S-1 chemotherapy for gastric cancer. A 73-year-old male underwent total gastrectomy in December 2020(palliative surgery)and S-1 chemotherapy was initiated in January 2021. The treatment was well tolerated until late March, when he presented with sudden abdominal pain and fever. He was diagnosed with perforation of the gastrointestinal tract and acute generalized peritonitis. Emergency laparotomy revealed a 2-mm perforation in the ileum, approximately 30 cm proximal to the terminal ileum. About 7 cm of ileum including the perforated area was partially resected. Histopathological analysis confirmed a Ul-Ⅳ ulcer with granulation tissue and severe inflammation. Based on clinical and pathological findings, the perforation was attributed to S-1-induced small intestinal ulceration. The patient subsequently received up to fourth-line chemotherapy. He survived for 15 months after the initial surgery."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common surgical emergency that can lead to significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs, particularly when diagnosis is delayed. In rural and resource-limited emergency settings, advanced imaging techniques like computed tomography (CT) may not be readily available. As a result, clinicians often rely on physical examinations and plain radiographs which can be unreliable. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) provides a rapid, radiation-free and cost-effective diagnostic alternative that can be performed directly at the bedside. We conducted a systematic review of published literature evaluating the diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of POCUS in identifying SBO on the following databases PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar databases from January 2000 to December 2024. Studies were screened and selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria adhering to PRISMA 2020 guidelines. The sensitivity of POCUS for SBO ranged from 85.0 to 100%, while specificity ranged from 54.0 to 100%. Diagnostic accuracy remained high across a broad range of expertise overcoming operator dependence. Examination durations are approximately 10-11 min, which is markedly shorter than 45-min to 3-h by CT. POCUS presents as a practical, scalable and cost-saving tool for diagnosing SBO in rural emergency care, addressing significant gaps where CT is not available and also facilitates faster diagnosis by timely identification of specific features. Future efforts should focus on developing validated algorithms for resource-limited settings allowing immediate care management."

    "abstract": "Biliary peritonitis following T-tube removal represents a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of common bile duct exploration that underscores the critical importance of risk assessment and early intervention in T-tube management. This case report describes a 72-year-old severely malnourished male patient (body mass index (BMI) 18.1 kg/m²) with multiple comorbidities who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with concomitant laparoscopic common bile duct exploration and T-tube placement for choledocholithiasis. Choledochoscopic findings at postoperative day 63 revealed incomplete fistulous tract formation at the time of T-tube removal, following which the patient developed acute and severe abdominal pain within 30 minutes, accompanied by elevated inflammatory markers. Despite aggressive conservative management, including broad-spectrum antibiotics and percutaneous drainage (800 mL of bile-stained fluid), the patient's clinical condition rapidly deteriorated to septic shock and respiratory failure within 48 hours. Emergency surgical intervention identified a 0.5×0.5 cm common bile duct fistula with extensive peritoneal bile accumulation, which was successfully repaired with new T-tube placement. Following intensive critical care management, the patient achieved complete recovery with hospital discharge after 41 days, and subsequent T-tube removal was uncomplicated. Twelve-month clinical follow-up demonstrated excellent functional outcomes with the restoration of normal appetite and absence of abdominal symptoms. This case emphasizes malnutrition as a critical and modifiable risk factor for inadequate fistulous tract formation and subsequent biliary peritonitis, highlighting the essential role of early clinical recognition, appropriate risk stratification, and coordinated multidisciplinary care with timely surgical intervention in optimizing patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "A 53-year-old man with uncontrolled diabetes presented with fever and diabetic ketoacidosis. Computed tomography revealed a large hepatic lesion containing mottled gas, but the origin was uncertain, delaying drainage and raising concern for gastric perforation. Next-morning computed tomography showed hepatic gas and free intraperitoneal air, yet abdominal findings were minimal. During percutaneous drainage planning, he developed sudden abdominal pain and septic shock, illustrating the rapid, life-threatening course of gas-forming pyogenic liver abscess. Urgent laparoscopy confirmed rupture; Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated. This case highlights diagnostic challenges and need for prompt reassessment and source control. Uncontrolled diabetes and ketoacidosis likely accelerated gas-forming pyogenic liver abscess rupture."

    "abstract": "Obturator hernia (OH) is a rare, potentially fatal cause of small bowel obstruction, mainly affecting elderly, thin females. Diagnosis is often delayed due to nonspecific symptoms, causing high morbidity and mortality. Left-sided OH is uncommon because of sigmoid colon protection. We present a left sided OH case managed with a novel appendiceal orifice decompression technique. An 80-year-old cachectic female (BMI 18 kg/m2) had five days of obstipation, bilious vomiting, abdominal distension, and pain. Clinical examination and abdominal radiographs suggested small bowel obstruction. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed a left obturator hernia containing ileal loops with dilated proximal bowel. Emergency laparotomy confirmed an 11.7 × 10.9 × 7.2 mm left obturator canal defect containing viable ileal loops. Herniated bowel was reduced, followed by appendectomy. Small bowel was decompressed via the appendiceal orifice, avoiding enterotomy. The defect was repaired with preperitoneal polypropylene mesh. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged on postoperative day 7, remaining asymptomatic at six months. OH, often presents with vague symptoms, complicating diagnosis. CT is the imaging modality of choice. Left-sided OH is rare. Appendiceal orifice decompression offers a bowel-conserving option in selected frail patients with a healthy appendix. Risks include stump leak and infection. Evidence is limited, requiring further studies for standardization. Early CT diagnosis and individualized surgical management are crucial. Appendiceal orifice decompression may be considered in high-risk patients, though further evidence is needed to define indications and safety."

Fetal intestinal volvulus without malrotation (IVWM) is rare. This report highlights successful valve preservation via tube ileostomy in a neonate with IVWM, offering practical insight into neonatal bowel management. A male neonate was delivered by emergency cesarean section at 37 weeks due to antenatal bowel dilation. A whirlpool sign on ultrasound prompted laparotomy, revealing a 1080-degree volvulus 2 cm distal to the ileocecal valve without malrotation. Thirty-two centimeters of necrotic ileum were resected. Due to inflammation, anastomosis was not feasible; an end ileostomy and distal tube ileostomy were performed, preserving 55 cm of proximal bowel and 2 cm distal to the valve. Weight gain improved following parenteral nutrition and stool recycling. Contrast study on day 53 confirmed distal patency, and reanastomosis was completed on day 94. The patient was discharged 47 days later. When immediate anastomosis is not feasible, distal closure is often chosen. This case shows that tube ileostomy with stool recycling can preserve function even with minimal distal ileum, supporting growth and adaptation. Tube ileostomy enabled valve preservation and a favorable outcome."

Plaster hardens in the stomach, risking obstruction or perforation. This case highlights the clinical challenges associated with managing plaster-induced bezoars and underscores the importance of prompt surgical and psychiatric intervention in such rare presentations. A 47-year-old man with a history of depression and daily methadone use presented to the emergency department with epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting 48 h after ingesting a mixture of plaster and water in a suicide attempt. Abdominal radiography revealed a large, radiopaque gastric mass. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy confirmed a solidified plaster bezoar causing mucosal injury. An emergency gastrotomy was performed, successfully removing a 20 × 15 × 20 cm plaster cast from the stomach. Plaster ingestion, though rare, can cause gastric outlet obstruction due to rapid hardening. Radiopaque masses on imaging. Early cases may respond to gastric irrigation or endoscopic management; however, delayed presentations typically require surgical intervention. Plaster ingestion is a rare but life-threatening cause of gastric bezoar that often necessitates surgical intervention in delayed cases. This case emphasizes urgent management, psychiatric follow-up, and awareness of complications to improve outcomes in such uncommon presentations.

    "abstract": "A left-sided appendicitis is rare and usually caused by congenital anomalies such as intestinal malrotation or situs inversus. Diagnosis can be particularly challenging in low-resource settings where imaging such as CT is unavailable. A 22-year-old female presented with periumbilical pain that migrated to left iliac fossa area over five days. Due to the lack of CT imaging, clinical evaluation led to a diagnosis of acute abdomen. Emergency laparotomy revealed a perforated appendix located in the left lower quadrant due to intestinal malrotation. Appendectomy was performed, and the patient recovered uneventfully. Her last menstrual period was one week before admission, and gynecologic causes were considered in the differential diagnosis but excluded intraoperatively. As a result of this case, appendicitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of left-sided abdominal pain. The intraoperative recognition of malrotation emphasizes the importance of surgical awareness of anatomical variations, particularly when preoperative imaging is lacking. The diagnosis of left-sided perforated appendicitis is rare, but should be considered in patients with atypical abdominal pain. In resource-limited environments, clinical judgment and timely surgical exploration are essential."

Here we present a case of small bowel diverticulitis which underwent successful conservative management at the time of initial presentation but required a surgical intervention for enterolith-associated small bowel obstruction during a subsequent hospitalization. We report the case of a 73-year-old female who presented with a small bowel diverticulitis and incidental discovery of an associated enterolith on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT). Patient responded well to nonoperative management with antibiotic therapy during the initial hospitalization. However, patient had short interval readmission due to small bowel obstruction secondary to the previously identified enterolith. Emergent surgical intervention was performed with extraction of an enterolith measuring 3 × 3 × 1.5 cm. The postoperative course was uneventful with immediate return of bowel function. Small bowel diverticulitis with enterolith-associated small bowel obstruction has been reported as a rare complication of small bowel diverticulosis. Obstructive symptoms caused by enteroliths >2.5 cm is less likely to self-resolve with nonoperative management. Prompt surgical intervention with enterolith extraction via simple enterotomy is a safe and effective approach to prevent further complications and avoidable hospital stay. In patients presenting with enterolith-associated small bowel obstruction, prompt evaluation and diagnosis with contrast-enhanced CT is recommended. Large enteroliths causing obstructive symptoms should be addressed with surgical intervention."

To compare surgical abortion complication rates in women with a history of previous CS to those without previous CS. Four databases were systematically searched in July 2024. Primary studies in English reporting on surgical abortion complications in women with and without a history of previous CS were included. Overall complications and major complications were compared between women with and without previous CS using a random effects meta-analysis. Sub-analyses were performed in women with > 1 previous CS, and incidence of emergency hysterectomy. Certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE. Ten retrospective cohort studies with 3123 women with and 14,514 without a previous CS were included in the meta-analysis. The overall incidence of major complications from surgical abortion was 0.9 %. Previous CS was associated with an increase in overall complications (OR = 2.00, CI 1.32-3.04, p = 0.001) and major complications (OR = 2.82, CI 1.83-4.36, p < 0.00001). Major complications included haemorrhage requiring transfusion, uterine perforation and unplanned laparoscopy/laparotomy, while minor complications included cervical laceration and the need for repeat evacuation. There were no cases of uterine rupture during pre-procedural cervical ripening. Hysterectomy was an exceptionally rare occurrence (0.05 %); low-quality evidence from seven studies showed an association between history of CS and need for emergency hysterectomy (OR = 8.73, CI = 1.83-41.61, p = 0.007). The quality of the evidence was judged to be very low to medium mainly due to risk of bias of the included studies. While major surgical complications of surgical abortion are rare, women with a prior history of CS were more than twice as likely to experience a complication."

We introduced a perioperative protocol for emergency laparotomies in 2019. Retrospective cohort of emergency laparotomies 2019-2022. Reoperations, trauma and converted laparoscopies (appendectomy and cholecystectomy) were excluded. Primary outcome was mortality at 30, 90, and 180 days. Secondary outcomes were postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo; CD) and hospital-based outcomes. Six hundred eighty-two patients undergoing emergency laparotomy were included. Age was 72 (IQR 23) years and 66.4% (n = 453) were aged ≥ 65 years 56.6% (n = 386) were ASA class III or IV and 6.5% (n = 44) were not living at home at admission.

    "title": "Minimally Invasive Surgical Techniques in the Treatment of Appendicitis: A Narrative Review.",
    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common abdominal surgical emergency worldwide, conventionally managed through open appendectomy until the advent of minimally invasive techniques. This narrative review gathers current evidence on minimally invasive surgical approaches for appendicitis, such as laparoscopic, single-incision, robotic, natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery, and endoscopic retrograde appendicitis therapy. The primary objective was to assess the efficacy, accessibility, and challenges of these techniques while addressing barriers to global implementation and strategies for optimization. Laparoscopic appendectomy is considered the gold standard, offering shorter hospital stays, reduced postoperative pain, and fewer surgical site infections compared to open surgery. Innovations such as single-incision laparoscopy and endoscopic retrograde appendicitis therapy show promise in enhancing cosmetic outcomes and organ preservation but encounter limitations because of technical complexity, costs, and infrastructural requirements, particularly in low-resource settings. Robotic-assisted appendectomy shows better ergonomics and recovery benefits but remains cost-prohibitive for global use. In special populations, like pediatric patients and pregnant women, tailored approaches enhance safety and outcomes. However, significant disparities remain in global access to minimally invasive techniques, caused by economic constraints and training gaps in low- and middle-income countries. In clinical practice, laparoscopic appendectomy is advised where expertise exists, with technique selection guided by patient-specific factors like age, pregnancy, and appendicitis severity. Future efforts must prioritize standardized training, funded equipment, diagnostic algorithms to reduce unnecessary surgeries, and rigorous validation of emerging therapies. Collaborative policy and research initiatives are essential to bridge global differences and achieve evidence-based, minimally invasive management of appendicitis in all populations."

    "abstract": "Mechanical small-bowel obstruction (SBO) has been recognized since antiquity. We systematically review the evolution of its diagnosis and treatment, with emphasis on surgical milestones, influential surgeons, and procedural advances alongside the development of imaging and non-operative therapy. We searched primary historical texts, monographs, and PubMed-indexed articles (inception to July 2025) for descriptions of mechanical SBO management. Data on key innovations, figures, outcomes, and global knowledge sharing were extracted and chronologically synthesized. Narrative synthesis followed SANRA criteria for scholarly reviews with emphasis on clarity of scope, critical interpretation, and structured presentation of key developments. Early sources solely describe non-surgical measures. In one of the first invasive interventions, Praxagoras of Cos (circa 350 BCE) reportedly advocated for surgical intervention in cases of intestinal obstruction, describing a decompressive enterocutaneous fistula as a therapeutic measure when purgation failed. Operative release of strangulated hernia was re-introduced by Ambroise Paré in the sixteenth century. Ether anesthesia (1846) and antisepsis (1867) enabled safe laparotomy; shortly thereafter, Sir Frederick Treves formalized the core operative principles in 1884. Plain abdominal radiography (1900s) improved diagnosis while Owen Wangensteen's nasogastric suction (1931) reduced mortality from > 60% to ~ 5%. Antibiotics, intravenous fluids, and stapled anastomoses further enhanced outcomes. Computed tomography (1980s) became the diagnostic gold standard, guiding selective non-operative management with enteral decompression and hyperosmolar contrast administration. Minimally invasive adhesiolysis, first embarked upon in the 1990s, now benefits carefully selected patients. Mechanical SBO care has evolved from basic supportive measures to structured, evidence-based therapy. Each advance addressed a specific clinical barrier: anesthesia enabled laparotomy, radiography enabled diagnosis, and decompression enabled non-operative management. As a result, SBO now exemplifies how iterative innovation can transform a once highly morbid emergency into a condition amenable to algorithmic, protocol-driven care. This historical arc offers instructive parallels for current surgical challenges."

We conducted a retrospective multicenter study including 693 adult patients diagnosed with AMI across 10 hospitals in Southern Spain between 2010 and 2020. Data collected included demographics, comorbidities, functional status, treatment strategies, and outcomes. A total of 693 patients were studied, 360 (54.2%) were women. The median age was 77.8 years; 85.8% were aged ≥ 65 years, and 31.8% were ≥ 85 years. In-hospital mortality was 62.4%, increasing to 70.1% among the very old people. A total of 62.6% of patients were admitted to Internal Medicine departments; these patients were older, more functionally dependent (57.8%), and more likely to have dementia (24.9%) than those admitted elsewhere. Only 18.5% underwent surgery. Baseline functional (OR 4.54; 95% CI 1.45-14.22; p = 0.009) and male sex (OR 2.64; 95% CI 1.12-6.22; p = 0.027). were the strongest predictor of surgical intervention. Older age was the strongest independence variabile related to mortality (OR 1.70; 95% CI 1.09-2.64; p = 0.020). AMI is a severe abdominal emergency that primarily affects older adults. Its nonspecific presentation often delays diagnosis, contributing to high mortality. Early detection and multidisciplinary management, involving internists and geriatricians, are key to improving prognosis and guiding treatment decisions aligned with patients' overall goals and functional status."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Appendicitis is a common surgical emergency, but the diagnosis may remain unclear and challenging, particularly in middle-aged women who present with atypical features. Atypical appendicitis, defined as appendiceal inflammation without classic migratory pain, nausea, or fever; it often mimics gynecological disorders, contributing to diagnostic delays. The present case is unique because it involved an unusually prolonged 2-month history of persistent suprapubic pain before acute exacerbation. Such a chronic course preceding the acute phase is uncommon and further complicated the diagnostic process, underscoring the need for clinical vigilance in prolonged, unexplained lower abdominal pain. CASE REPORT A 46-year-old woman presented with a 2-month history of persistent suprapubic pain without associated systemic symptoms. Her gynecological history included prolonged intrauterine copper device use and recent postcoital bleeding. Initial clinical evaluation suggested pelvic inflammatory disease, and empirical antibiotics provided minimal symptomatic relief. Laboratory investigations and imaging, including pelvic ultrasound and computed tomography, were inconclusive, demonstrating bilateral simple ovarian cysts and a minimally distended appendix with mild periappendiceal fat stranding. Due to worsening localized right lower abdominal pain and persistent symptoms, laparoscopic appendectomy was performed. Histopathology confirmed early acute appendicitis. The patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful. CONCLUSIONS This case underscores the need to maintain high clinical suspicion for appendicitis despite normal white blood cell counts and equivocal imaging, thereby supporting re-evaluation protocols for persistent abdominal pain."

Appendicitis is the most frequent diagnosis, followed by bowel obstruction and female genital conditions. Some rare aetiologies may lead to challenges in surgical management. Aim of this study is to analyse the distribution of rare causes of acute abdomen in patients undergoing emergency surgery in the past five years at our centre. Records of patients undergone urgent abdominal surgery were retrospectively reviewed from 2015 to 2019. Information relative to age, sex, underlying pathology, and surgery was recorded. The inclusion criteria were age <18 years and undergoing abdominal surgery. Neonates were excluded. The study population consisted of 957 patients. Median age was 9.7 years. Surgical procedure was laparoscopic in 22%, open in 78%. Common diagnoses were appendicitis in 815 patients, bowel obstruction in 72, adnexal and gynaecological pathology in 43, trauma in 9, complicated Meckel's diverticulum in 8. Rare findings included omental pathology (2), endometriosis (2), ectopic pregnancy (1), intestinal duplication (1), internal hernia (1), Amyand's hernia (1), epiploic appendix torsion (1), accessory spleen torsion (1). The aetiologies of acute abdomen in children vary depending on the age. Appendicitis is the most common surgical cause of acute abdomen, followed by other causes. Differential diagnosis, including rare pathologies, is required to predict the right surgical approach and to apply the proper treatment. Imaging techniques sometimes still result too invasive or insufficient, whereas the widespread use of laparoscopy may render surgical exploration acceptable in selected cases."

Gestalt improved with blood test results, with overall diagnostic accuracy increasing from 65.9% pre-blood tests to 88.5% post-blood tests. Ultrasound (US) was performed in 361 (75.1%) children with a diagnostic accuracy of 90.6% and was frequently used even in patients deemed low-risk post-blood tests (65.7%). One hundred and fifty (31.2%) of suspected AA cases underwent surgery, with 3 negative appendectomies and 1 ovarian cystectomy without appendectomy. Median (IQR) hospital length of stay was significantly longer for AA cases than non-AA cases [50.8 (35.3 to 95.0) h vs. 7.1 (4.6 to 16.8) h]. This study reviews the management and outcomes of suspected AA in a high-volume Australian ED. It shows the importance of blood tests in improving diagnostic accuracy of clinician gestalt and highlights the potential overuse of US in low-risk patients. Future research should explore a more structured diagnostic approach to increase diagnostic accuracy, optimize resource utilization, and improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Two of the most common emergent surgical interventions are acute appendicitis and acute cholecystitis. However, synchronous presentation is rare. In this report, we present a 29-year-old female patient with three days of worsening right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain with nausea and vomiting. Physical examination showed tenderness to palpation at the RLQ. Workup showed acute appendicitis with probable localized perforation and peri-appendiceal abscess, and CT-guided drainage was performed. The patient was discharged after four days. Seventeen days later, the patient returned to the ED with complaints of new right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain with nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. The ultrasound showed similar gallbladder findings with a positive sonographic Murphy's sign. A CT scan showed appendicitis and cholecystitis with gallstones and mild gallbladder wall thickening. The patient then had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and appendectomy. This case report sheds new light on this rare and interesting surgical emergency."

    "abstract": "Transanal drainage tubes (TDTs) are commonly used after low anterior resection to reduce intraluminal pressure around the anastomosis. Although associated complications are usually minor, bowel perforation related to TDT placement is exceedingly rare. We report the case of a 71-year-old man who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic low anterior resection for rectal cancer. A TDT was inserted intraoperatively, and its position was adjusted under laparoscopic guidance. Abdominal radiography performed on postoperative day (POD) 1 showed that the tube tip was located approximately 7 cm proximal to the anastomosis. On POD 4, the patient developed abdominal pain and signs of peritonitis. Computed tomography demonstrated free air and localized fluid collection near the tube tip. Anastomotic leakage or TDT-induced bowel perforation was suspected, and emergency reoperation was undertaken. Laparoscopic exploration confirmed that the TDT had penetrated the colon wall proximal to the anastomosis, resulting in a perforation. Primary suture repair of the perforation and creation of a diverting loop ileostomy were performed. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient recovered without further complications. This case highlights an uncommon but serious complication associated with TDT placement and underscores the importance of meticulous intraoperative positioning, close postoperative monitoring, and prompt evaluation when unexpected abdominal symptoms arise."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency, but its parasitic causes are often overlooked, particularly in non-endemic regions. Schistosomiasis, which affects over 250 million people globally, can rarely lead to schistosomal appendicitis (SA). A 32-year-old Filipino woman presented with acute right iliac fossa pain, vomiting, and loose stools. Clinical and imaging findings were consistent with appendicitis, and she underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy. Histopathological analysis revealed multiple calcified Schistosoma ova in the appendiceal wall, confirming SA. The patient recovered uneventfully and was referred to the Infectious Diseases department for further management. This case represents the third reported instance of SA in Qatar. SA is clinically and radiologically indistinguishable from typical appendicitis and is usually diagnosed retrospectively via histopathology. SA should be considered in the differential diagnosis of appendicitis in migrants from endemic regions. Routine histopathological examination of appendectomy specimens is crucial for accurate diagnosis and appropriate postoperative care."

We report a 4-year-old male who presented with acute febrile illness, suprapubic abdominal pain, and dysuria, initially managed as cystitis. Despite treatment, he developed peritonitis; imaging revealed free subdiaphragmatic air. Exploratory laparotomy showed an ischemic ascending colon with a solitary perforation, necessitating right hemicolectomy with ileocolic anastomosis. Histopathology demonstrated nonspecific ileitis, typhlitis, and colitis complicated by cecal perforation, with no evidence of typhoid, tuberculosis, or inflammatory bowel disease. Postoperative recovery was uneventful following broad-spectrum antibiotics. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge of spontaneous colonic perforation in children, where non-specific presentations may mimic urinary tract or infectious illnesses. Early recognition and timely surgical intervention are crucial to reduce morbidity and mortality. To our knowledge, this represents one of the few pediatric reports of spontaneous ascending colon perforation in the absence of identifiable etiology."

    "abstract": "Gastric ulcer perforation remains a life-threatening emergency requiring timely surgical intervention. Multiple operative techniques exist, including primary closure, modified Graham's patch repair, gastrojejunostomy, and use of falciform ligament in cases of omental deficiency. A retrospective analysis was conducted from January 2020 to December 2024 involving 120 patients diagnosed with gastric ulcer perforation. The study included patients treated at both SRVS Medical College and a local private hospital. Based on intraoperative findings and surgeon preference, patients underwent one of the following surgical techniques: Group A (n = 40)-primary closure; Group B (n = 35)-modified Graham's patch repair; Group C (n = 25)-gastrojejunostomy for giant perforations; Group D (n = 20)-falciform ligament patch in cases with deficient greater omentum. Group A showed shorter operative time (mean 55 ± 10 min) and hospital stay (mean 6 ± 2 days), but had a 15% rate of minor leakage. Group B had a leakage rate of 8.5%, with slightly longer operative time (mean 70 ± 12 min). Group C, used in giant perforations (>2 cm), had the longest operative time (mean 95 ± 15 min) but the lowest leak rate (4%), albeit with a prolonged hospital stay (mean 10 ± 3 days). Group D showed moderate outcomes with a 10% complication rate and hospital stay of 8 ± 2 days. Mortality was highest in Group A (2 cases), likely due to delayed presentation and peritonitis. Modified Graham's patch repair and gastrojejunostomy offer better outcomes in terms of leakage prevention and postoperative recovery compared to primary closure. The falciform ligament serves as a viable alternative in cases of omental deficiency."

    "abstract": "This case was specifically designed for senior emergency medicine (EM) resident physicians as a preparatory tool for the American Board of Emergency Medicine (ABEM) Certifying Exam. However, it is applicable for EM residents at all levels of training. \"A hallmark of emergency medicine is the ability to triage or prioritize care. This case will require the physician to evaluate and treat multiple patients while ensuring those who require immediate care receive it quickly. The physician may face the arrival of additional patients, the deterioration of existing patients, and realistic workflow interruptions during the case. A successful candidate will identify and stabilize high acuity patients.\"1 With the introduction of the new Certifying Exam by ABEM and the current lack of resources to practice prioritization in an assessment setting, resident physicians will need practice material in order to adequately prepare for their board examination. By the end of this case learners will be able to: 1) Become familiar with format of a prioritization case (a component of the ABEM Certifying Exam), 2) Practice their ability to prioritize multiple 313 patients and provide stabilizing care, 3) Consider changes in status/patient acuity/new cases as presented, 4) Understand how to utilize team resources appropriately. This encounter is a structured, oral simulation case designed as a prioritization exercise for emergency medicine resident trainees. It follows an interview-based format in which an examiner presents evolving patient information in a time-limited scenario, and the examinee responds in real time with clinical reasoning, prioritization of care, and management decisions. The case mimics the structure of the Prioritization Case in the ABEM Certifying Exam, allowing the examinee to verbalize thought processes while receiving updated clinical data from the examiner. This format emphasizes critical thinking, triage under pressure, and the delegation of tasks within a simulated emergency department environment. We first alpha-tested the case with board-certified emergency medicine physicians, who evaluated both the facilitator and learner aspects of the simulation. Their feedback was used to refine the structure, flow, and clinical realism of the case. Following these edits, the revised case was implemented with emergency medicine residents across varying levels of training. This staged approach allowed us to ensure educational fidelity and enhance realism, while also confirming that the case structure aligned with ABEM exam standards and expectations. We conducted multi-site alpha and beta testing of a novel ABEM-style prioritization case with a total of 18 emergency medicine residents (eight individual residents and two 5-person PGY2 teams) and three facilitators. Surveys were completed by two facilitators (Simulation Scenario Evaluation Tool, SSET) and eight resident participants or teams (modified usability survey). Facilitators rated the case highly, with an average global score of 87.5/100, and learners reported strong overall quality (4.4/5) and exceptional educational value (4.9/5), though clarity of instructions was rated lower (3.6/5). Participants were predominantly senior residents (62.5% PGY-3, 25.0% PGY-2, and 12.5% PGY-4). Qualitative comments emphasized the usefulness of practicing the new case format and highlighted a need for clearer explanations of structure and rules.These results suggest the case was well-received across training levels, with iterative revisions improving clarity and usability. Based on preliminary beta testing, a Total Score of 70-75% indicates passing for this case. This oral board-style prioritization case offers learners the opportunity to practice essential but often underemphasized skills, including rapid prioritization, task switching, and real-time decision-making. The case format reinforces critical concepts such as situational awareness and resource management within the dynamic environment of the emergency department. During initial implementation, participants reported strong engagement and found the exercise particularly valuable in preparing for the ABEM Certifying Exam. Many noted that the structure and expectations closely mirrored those of the actual prioritization station based on the example video provided by ABEM.From the instructor perspective, the standardized format promotes consistent delivery and assessment. To minimize examiner cognitive load during this high-complexity simulation, we developed a modular toolkit including a structured script, stimuli slides, and an automated scoring sheet, modeled in part after ABEM's dual-examiner approach. A suite of Appendices supports both digital and paper-based use, allowing flexibility across educational settings.To further support formative practice, we created a scoring rubric to guide examiner feedback and learner self-assessment. However, as ABEM has not released its internal scoring criteria, this rubric is unofficial and should be interpreted with caution. It is intended for educational use only and is not designed to predict performance on the actual certification exam.

    "abstract": "To evaluate predictive models for complicated acute appendicitis (CAA) and provide insights into their performance, bias, and clinical applicability. PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar were searched up to December 31, 2024. Eligible studies included those with clearly defined predictors and reported model performance metrics. A bivariate random-effects model was applied to pool sensitivity and specificity while estimating the SROC curves. Bias was assessed using the PROBAST tool. A total of 20 studies focusing on the development and validation of emerging predictive models for complicated AA were included. These models demonstrated pooled sensitivities of 0.840, 0.840, and 0.787, specificities of 0.825, 0.768, and 0.707, and AUCs of 0.897, 0.867, and 0.811 in training, internal validation, and external validation datasets, respectively. PROBAST assessment revealed low risk of bias in participants, predictors, and outcomes across most studies, but a consistently high risk of bias in the analysis domain. Emerging prediction models for CAA show promising potential but face major challenges in external validation and clinical implementation. Future research should prioritize methodologically robust model development, including prespecified sample size estimation, proper imputation strategies, multivariable predictor selection, and both internal and external validation."

    "abstract": "Background: Acute appendicitis, a frequent pediatric surgical emergency, requires distinguishing simple from complicated cases for treatment decisions. Current tools, such as clinical scores and ultrasound, are sometimes ineffective. This study evaluates the biomarkers: neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio (NLR), monocytes to lymphocytes ratio (MLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), neutrophils to monocytes ratio (NMR), neutrophils to platelet ratio (NPR), pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV) ratio, and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) to lymphocytes ratio (CLR) for differentiation between simple and complicated appendicitis. Methods: A retrospective study of 878 pediatric patients (<18 years) who underwent appendectomy (2018-2024) at a tertiary medical center, with appendicitis classified as simple (SA, n = 696) or complicated (CA, n = 182) using intraoperative findings. Biomarkers were calculated from preoperative blood counts and CRP. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed using Mann-Whitney U tests, ROC curves, and logarithmic regression. Results: Patients with CA had higher neutrophils counts (13.61 ± 4.92 vs. 11.39 ± 4.29 K/μL), monocytes counts (1.23 ± 1.41 vs. 0.95 ± 0.48 K/μL), platelet counts (294.31 ± 72.73 vs. 270.15 ± 72.08 K/μL), CRP levels (88.55 ± 97.75 vs. 27.15 ± 44.74 mg/L), and elevated biomarker ratios as compared to those with SA: NLR (≥10.15, OR = 2.45), MLR (≥0.645, OR = 2.78), PLR (≥224.38, OR = 2.502), NMR (≥6.38, OR = 2.34), NPR (≥0.0405, OR = 1.876), PIV (≥2433.85, OR = 3.348), and CLR (≥11.77, OR = 5.935), all at p < 0.01. CLR demonstrated the highest accuracy (AUC = 0.772, sensitivity 78%, specificity 62.6%), outperforming established biomarkers, followed by PIV (AUC = 0.679). NPR was the least effective marker (AUC = 0.569). Conclusions: CLR, a promising biomarker, can aid in distinguishing complicated from simple appendicitis in children, and may offer accessible tools for resource-limited settings."

This retrospective analysis aimed to identify key predictors for the need for surgery in SBO management and to develop a simple clinical risk score to support decision-making. Methods: This retrospective study included 285 patients treated for SBO at the University Hospital Erlangen from 2018 to 2022. Pretherapeutic clinical, laboratory, and imaging data, as well as treatment details and outcome parameters were assessed and analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression to identify significant predictors for the need of surgery. A weighted point-based risk score was then derived from the final model, and its discriminative performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: Of the 285 patients, 234 (82.1%) underwent surgery and 51 (17.9%) were successfully managed conservatively. Multivariate analysis identified the following independent predictors for surgery: 0-1 previous abdominal operation (OR 4.7, p = 0.009), serum albumin ≤ 34 g/L (OR 4.5, p = 0.011), free intraperitoneal fluid on imaging (OR 3.6, p = 0.015), air-fluid levels on plain abdominal X-ray (OR 3.5, p = 0.024) and a transition point on CT (OR 11.4, p = 0.002). A weighted score (range 0-6 points) was constructed, assigning 1 point to each of the first four predictors and 2 points to the transition point. The score showed good discrimination for predicting the need for surgery (AUC 0.874). Using a cut-off of ≥3 points, sensitivity was 96.2% and specificity 64.7%. The observed proportion of patients requiring surgery increased from 21.4% in the low-risk group (0-2 points) to 88.6% in the intermediate-risk group (3-4 points) and 97.3% in the high-risk group (5-6 points). Conclusions: The proposed predictors and the weighted risk score may support bedside decision-making in SBO by distinguishing patients who require surgery from those eligible for conservative management, but they require prospective multicenter validation before routine clinical implementation."

    "title": "The Prognostic Value of Biomarkers in Patients Diagnosed with Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis.",
    "abstract": "Background: Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a life-threatening complication of cirrhosis associated with high morbidity and mortality. Early risk stratification remains challenging due to the invasive nature of ascitic polymorphonuclear cell counting and the limited sensitivity of conventional markers. Novel composite biomarkers such as the blood urea nitrogen/albumin ratio (BAR), red cell distribution width/albumin ratio (RAR), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) may offer practical prognostic value. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive power of these biomarkers for in-hospital mortality in patients diagnosed with SBP in the emergency department. Methods: This retrospective, observational, cohort study included adult patients diagnosed with SBP between March 2022 and October 2024. SBP diagnosis was confirmed by ascitic fluid leukocyte count > 250/mm3. Demographic data, laboratory parameters, and clinical outcomes were obtained from hospital records. RAR and BAR ratios were calculated at admission. Outcomes were analyzed according to ward/intensive care unit (ICU) admission and in-hospital mortality. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and logistic regression were performed to assess prognostic performance. Results: A total of 112 patients were included (mean age 63.44 ± 13.16 years, 56.3% male). In-hospital mortality was 43.8%. Both BAR and RAR ratios were significantly higher in non-survivors (p = 0.016 and p = 0.001, respectively). BAR showed the highest prognostic performance (Area under the curve 0.761), with an optimal cutoff > 1.86 (sensitivity 64.44%, specificity 79.66%). RAR had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.638, and NLR had an AUC of 0.658. Conclusions: Among the evaluated biomarkers, BAR emerged as the strongest predictor of in-hospital mortality in SBP, outperforming both RAR and NLR. Although albumin alone was not predictive, its use in composite ratios improved prognostic accuracy. These easily accessible biomarkers may support early risk stratification in emergency settings."

Differentiating between complicated (CAA) and uncomplicated (UAA) forms is essential for selecting the appropriate management-operative or non-operative-and for optimizing patient prioritization and outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of emerging inflammatory indices in distinguishing these forms of AA. Methods: A total of 514 adult patients with surgically confirmed AA were retrospectively analyzed. Six immune-inflammatory indices-neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), and pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV)-were calculated and compared with intraoperative and histopathological findings. Postoperative outcomes, including length of hospital stay (LOS) and hospitalization costs, were also evaluated. Results: All six indices were significantly higher in intraoperatively identified complicated cases (p < 0.0001). In histopathological analysis, five indices (NLR, MLR, SII, SIRI, and PIV) remained significantly elevated in patients with wall necrosis or perforation (p = 0.000-0.019), while PLR did not reach statistical significance. The indices showed fair diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.664-0.719, p < 0.0001). NLR and MLR were independent risk factors for CAA (p = 0.006 and p = 0.016), and MLR was also independently associated with complicated histopathological findings (p = 0.036). PIV independently predicted both increased LOS and higher hospitalization costs (p = 0.001 for each). Conclusions: These easily calculable inflammatory markers can serve as useful adjuncts for preoperative stratification of AA, supporting timely decision-making and contributing to more cost-effective emergency surgical care."

Despite being stable on adjuvant therapy, her CT scan confirmed bowel obstruction with intussusception-suggestive findings, though a clear neoplastic lead point was not initially identified. Emergency laparotomy subsequently revealed intussusception with a tumour as the lead point, which histopathology confirmed as metastatic leiomyosarcoma.

A 65-year-old female underwent this procedure after recurrent infections and instability following hip hemiarthroplasty. The patient who underwent a Girdlestone procedure experienced life-threatening hemorrhage likely due to excessive external rotation and femoral shortening during post-operative transfer. A computed tomography scan revealed active SGA extravasation, necessitating emergent embolization by interventional radiology. There are currently no reported cases of this event occurring in the literature. This case underscores the need for vigilance in post-operative monitoring for vascular complications, particularly in high-risk patients. This report emphasizes the importance of recognizing and promptly addressing vascular injuries, as well as prioritizing care-team communications, to improve patient outcomes."

Males and females aged 50-74 years were randomised to once-only sigmoidoscopy or biennial faecal immunochemical test in a CRC screening trial at two screening centres in Norway. Participants in the present study underwent follow-up colonoscopy from 2012 to April 2020 after initial positive screening test. We reviewed medical records for adverse events within 30 days following 11 205 colonoscopies. The primary outcome of the study was to assess the sensitivity of claims data from the Norwegian Patient Registry to identify lower gastrointestinal bleeding using emergency contact International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision diagnostic code sets under two definitions: a stringent definition (codes explicitly identifying bleeding) and a broad definition (including suggestive codes). Secondary outcome measures included the sensitivity to identify perforation using a stringent and a broad definition. Additionally, we assessed whether incorporating procedure codes and non-emergency contacts improved accuracy. 87 cases of lower gastrointestinal bleeding and eight perforations were confirmed. Sensitivity for bleeding differed between the centres (p<0.001). At centre 1, sensitivity was 48.6% (95% CI 31.9% to 65.6%) using the stringent and 89.2% (95% CI 74.6% to 97.0%) using the broad definition. At centre 2, sensitivity was 36.0% (95% CI 22.9% to 50.8%) and 50.0% (95% CI 35.5% to 64.5%), respectively. Combined sensitivity for perforation was 37.5% (95% CI 8.5% to 75.5%) using the stringent and 62.5% (95% CI 24.5% to 91.5%) using the broad definition. Adding procedure codes and non-emergency contacts slightly increased sensitivity but increased false positives. Use of claims data underestimated adverse event rates following colonoscopy.

Less morbid alternatives are less common. This study compares a transverse blowhole colostomy as a first-stage intervention in diverticular-associated obstruction. Our primary aim was to compare colostomy reversal rates and postoperative outcomes between blowhole colostomy and Hartmann's procedure. This is a single-center, retrospective cohort study. An institutional database was utilized to retrospectively identify adult patients who underwent Hartmann's procedure or blowhole colostomy for diverticular strictures with obstruction between 2012 and 2023. Thirty-nine patients underwent Hartmann's procedure for diverticular strictures with obstruction and 15 patients underwent blowhole colostomy. The blowhole colostomy group had a significantly shorter postoperative length of stay (median 5 vs. 8 days, p = 0.01). Colostomy reversal was more frequent in the blowhole group (81.3% vs. 56.4%, p = 0.08), with a shorter median time to reversal (3 months vs. 4.7 months, p = 0.01). A significant increase in reversals performed using a minimally invasive approach (84.6% vs. 50%, p < 0.01) occurred in the blowhole colostomy group. No significant differences were observed in other postoperative outcomes, including proximal diversion after colostomy reversal. Blowhole colostomy may be a viable alternative to a Hartmann's procedure for diverticular-associated large bowel obstruction, offering potential benefits such as shorter hospital stays, higher rates of colostomy reversal, and a greater likelihood of minimally invasive reversal. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings."

Food impaction, particularly in the esophagus, can lead to significant morbidity and requires timely intervention. While cola is commonly used for fruit bezoars, its application in treating meat and bone bezoars is rare. This case report details the management of a large bone impaction in the esophagus of a 64-year-old male using Cola and endoscopic techniques. A 64-year-old male presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain and a sensation of food impaction after consuming a meal. Initial evaluations, including a chest X-ray and electrocardiogram, showed no abnormalities. The patient was referred to a gastrointestinal (GI) clinic, where an endoscopy revealed a large piece of lamb bone impacted in the esophagus. Conventional endoscopic methods to remove or reduce the size of the impaction were unsuccessful. Cola was then injected through the soft portion of the food impaction, effectively reducing its size and allowing it to pass into the gastric cavity with gentle manipulation. The patient was monitored post-procedure and discharged after a follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan, which confirmed no esophageal perforation."

To date, ambiguity exists regarding definitive management, particularly when deciding between elective surgery and repeated endoscopic decompression. This study aimed to develop guidelines for the management of SV within our trust. Methods This retrospective study was conducted over three years at Pilgrim Hospital, Boston, United Kingdom. Data were collected from online clinical records and case notes. The study was registered with the trust audit department before commencement. Comorbidities were analyzed using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI).

Descriptive statistics summarized patient demographics, comorbidities, diagnostic tests, and management modalities. Categorical variables are presented as frequencies and percentages, while continuous variables are reported as medians. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess recurrence-free survival from the index admission. Results A total of 42 patients with SV were identified, 31 (73.8%) of whom were male. The median age was 77 years. Based on CCI, 32 (76.2%) patients had moderate or severe comorbidities. Twenty-nine patients (69%) received both an abdominal X-ray (AXR) and a CT scan, suggesting limited additional value of AXR, especially since CT is preferred in many centers and is essential for identifying potential complications. Fourteen patients (33%) had previous recurrent SV, including two patients with six prior recurrences. Eighteen (43%) underwent rigid sigmoidoscopy, 12 (28.5%) had flexible sigmoidoscopy, and seven (16.6%) had both, all achieving successful decompression. Four patients (9.5%) experienced spontaneous resolution before endoscopic decompression. Emergency surgery was required in only one patient after failed decompression. The median hospital stay was three days. Fifteen patients (35.7%) experienced further recurrences after the index admission. Overall mortality was two patients (4.8%): one due to perforation after endoscopic decompression and one from perforation secondary to recurrent volvulus, both deemed unfit for surgery. Only five patients (11.9%) underwent definitive surgery, typically after multiple recurrences, with one patient receiving surgery after the 11th recurrence. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that recurrences commonly occurred within 90 days of the index admission, supporting consideration of early definitive surgery. Conclusions Based on this study, we developed local guidelines for expedited management of SV tailored to NHS resources and consistent with World Society of Emergency Surgery recommendations. Optimal management requires a holistic approach integrating early surgical intervention with comorbidity assessment. Early decisions regarding definitive surgery can reduce recurrences, readmissions, morbidity, and healthcare costs."

    "abstract": "Diaphragmatic hernias arise when a defect in the diaphragmatic musculotendinous framework allows the abnormal protrusion of abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity, which can be further complicated by visceral incarceration, strangulation, and perforation. Whilst the vast majority occur congenitally or are acquired through trauma, diaphragmatic hernias arising from iatrogenic insults represent an exceedingly rare but important clinical entity. Diagnostic challenges arise in large part due to their tendency towards delayed presentation, often with varied, nonspecific and subacute clinical manifestations, as well as equivocal or indeterminate radiographic findings. The report herein represents the inaugural account of an iatrogenic diaphragmatic hernia arising following thoracoscopic pleural endometriosis removal, which was subsequently complicated by gastric strangulation and perforation, culminating in a life-threatening tension pneumothorax. We describe a safe, effective approach to managing this surgical emergency using an entirely laparoscopic technique and relate our findings to the broader literature pertaining to complicated diaphragmatic hernias."

We report a case of a 38-year-old woman with a history of open ovarian cystectomy 15 years earlier, presenting with persistent abdominal pain. Imaging revealed a complex pelvic mass with abscess formation and enteric fistula. Despite interventional drainage and antibiotic therapy, the patient developed signs of sepsis. Endoscopic evaluation revealed a retained surgical textile in the rectum, which was extracted. The patient subsequently developed generalized peritonitis and underwent emergency laparotomy revealing two retained textilomas and multiple intestinal perforations. Despite aggressive surgical intervention, the patient succumbed to septic shock on postoperative day one. Textiloma should be considered in patients with atypical abdominal masses and previous surgical history. Preventive strategies and early recognition are critical to avoid fatal outcomes."

    "abstract": "Ischemic colitis is a common gastrointestinal disorder. However, severe cases requiring surgical intervention are rare. Severe ischemic colitis is particularly uncommon following surgery for colorectal cancer, with a reported incidence of only 0.7%. To our knowledge, there have been no previous reports of ischemic colitis leading to perforation in the late postoperative period following colorectal cancer surgery. Herein, we report a rare case of ischemic colitis that developed following surgery for transverse colon cancer and progressed to colonic perforation despite conservative treatment, ultimately necessitating emergency surgery. A 60-year-old man with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, chronic kidney disease, and stage III colorectal cancer underwent laparoscopic anterior resection 15 months prior. The patient presented with lower abdominal pain, hematochezia, and fever. CT and colonoscopy revealed extensive ischemic changes from the descending to the sigmoid colon, leading to a diagnosis of ischemic colitis. The patient's condition failed to improve despite conservative treatment, and he subsequently developed cerebral infarction and worsening heart failure during hospitalization. In the 6th week of admission, he experienced perforative peritonitis, necessitating high-risk emergency surgery consisting of left hemicolectomy, rectal resection, and transverse colostomy. Pathological examination revealed no malignancy, consistent with the ischemic changes. The patient gradually recovered under intensive care and was discharged on POD 44, after 86 days of hospitalization. This case highlights the challenges in managing ischemic colitis in patients with severe heart failure after colorectal surgery. Vigilant monitoring and early surgical intervention are crucial for high-risk individuals."

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the potential to enhance wound healing by releasing various growth factors and antiinflammatory cytokines. This study aims to evaluate and analyze the impact of MSCs on the healing process of duodenal perforation wounds. MSCs were extracted from the umbilical cords of rats and injected into the site of duodenal perforation at two different doses: 1.5 × 106 for Treatment Group 1 and 3 × 106 for Treatment Group 2. The control group consisted of rats with duodenal perforation that received local injections on normal saline. The levels of Transforming Growth Factor β (TGF-β) and Alpha Smooth Muscle Actin (α-SMA) were assessed via Western Blot analysis, while collagen and fibroblast presence were evaluated through histopathological examination. These examinations were conducted on days 3 and 7 post-treatment. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 25.0, with significance defined at p<0.05. Significant increases in the expression of TGF-β, fibroblasts, collagen, and α-SMA were observed in the treatment groups compared to the control group on both day 3 and day 7. The administration of MSCs significantly enhances the proliferation phase of duodenal wound healing through the increased expression of fibroblasts, collagen, TGF-β, and α-SMA."

While laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) has become the preferred technique in high-income countries due to reduced postoperative complications and shorter recovery times, its adoption in Sub-Saharan Africa is limited by resource constraints. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the safety, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of LA compared to open appendectomy (OA) in this region. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a systematic search was conducted across PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, AJOL, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science from database inception to July 2025. Eligible studies included original research comparing LA and OA for acute appendicitis in Sub-Saharan Africa, with outcomes such as surgical site infection (SSI), operative time, hospital stay, and costs. LA significantly reduced SSI risk [risk ratio 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.23-0.69, P = 0.001, I 2 = 0%] and hospital stay [mean defference (MD) 1.32 days, 95% CI: 1.64-0.99, P < 0.00001, I 2 = 86%) compared to OA across 452 and 521 patients, respectively. Operative time was longer with LA (MD 13.79 minutes, 95% CI: 7.23-20.35, P < 0.0001, I 2 = 78%). Cost data from two studies were inconclusive, with OA being less expensive in one (P < 0.001) and LA showing a borderline advantage in another (P = 0.049), with no significant difference in theatre costs (USD 634.92 versus USD 589.20, P = 0.264).

    "abstract": "Trichobezoars are rare but significant causes of gastrointestinal obstruction in children, most commonly confined to the stomach. In certain cases, these bezoars can grow large enough to extend into the duodenum, resulting in severe gastrointestinal complications. A previously healthy 16-year-old female presented with an 8-hour history of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Physical examination revealed a palpable mass in the epigastric and left hypochondriac regions. Paraclinical investigations, including laboratory tests and imaging, yielded no significant abnormalities. The patient subsequently underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy, which identified a large trichobezoar. An anterior gastrotomy was performed, and the bezoar was successfully removed in one piece. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 17, after tolerating a regular diet. She was referred for psychiatric evaluation to address underlying trichotillomania and trichophagia, with the goal of preventing recurrence. Rapunzel syndrome predominantly affects young females with underlying psychiatric conditions. Delayed diagnosis is common, often leading to serious gastrointestinal complications, including perforation, infections, cholangitis, obstructive jaundice, intussusception, and pancreatitis. Early detection and intervention are crucial to prevent these potentially life-threatening outcomes. Surgical removal through gastrotomy is typically required, particularly for large bezoars. Trichobezoars, though rare, present serious health risks when left untreated, especially in pediatric patients with underlying psychiatric disorders like trichotillomania and trichophagia. Prompt diagnosis and intervention, including surgical removal, are essential to avoid severe complications. This highlights the importance of early recognition and multidisciplinary care in managing trichobezoar-related gastrointestinal complications."

This study aimed to identify predictors of postoperative complications and mortality among patients undergoing emergency surgery for perforated PUD in a tertiary care center of Nepal. A prospective cohort study of consecutive adults undergoing emergency laparotomy with omental patch repair for perforated PUD was performed. Demographics, clinical, and perioperative data were recorded using a structured proforma. Predictors of complications and in-hospital mortality were assessed with logistic regression; results are reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Among the 85 patients (mean age 42 ± 15.4 years; 88% males), complications occurred in 42.4% and mortality in 5.9%. Age ≥60 years (adjusted OR 30.4, 95% CI 2.7-347.7; P = 0.006) and preoperative shock (adjusted OR 13.9, 95% CI 2-92.9; P = 0.006) were associated with higher odds of complications. Age ≥60 years and preoperative shock may help identify patients at higher risk of postoperative complications after perforated PUD repair. Given the small sample size and event constraints, these results are exploratory; multicenter validation with adequate power is warranted."

A significant proportion of patients present as emergencies with obstruction, perforation, or bleeding, necessitating emergency colorectal surgery (EMCRS). This study aimed to compare the outcomes of patients undergoing EMCRS with those undergoing elective colorectal surgery (ELCRS). This retrospective-prospective cohort study included patients undergoing curative CRC resections at a tertiary center in Southern India between January 2010 and June 2022. Patients with metastatic disease or palliative procedures were excluded. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed (1:1) based on age, sex, tumor location, and stage. Outcomes assessed included postoperative complications, inpatient mortality, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Among 558 patients (106 EMCRS, 305 ELCRS), 106 matched pairs were analysed. Before PSM, EMCRS had significantly higher morbidity (71.4% vs. 40.7%, p < 0.001) and mortality (17.9% vs. 2.3%, p < 0.001). After PSM, EMCRS continued to show increased severe complications (Clavien-Dindo IV/V), sepsis, pulmonary and cardiac complications, and higher inpatient mortality (17.9% vs. 0.9%, p < 0.001). However, long-term outcomes were not significantly different (DFS: 58 ± 3 vs. 55.5 ± 4.7 months, p = 0.19; OS: 67.5 ± 2.9 vs. 69.7 ± 4.9 months, p = 0.391). EMCRS is linked to significantly worse short-term outcomes. The difference in long-term survival appears to stem from advanced disease at presentation rather than the emergency nature of surgery. Enhanced screening and preoperative optimization strategies may help improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a valuable diagnostic and therapeutic procedure for pancreaticobiliary disorders, but may rarely result in severe complications such as duodenal perforation. A 77-year-old man with hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and benign prostatic hyperplasia presented with painless obstructive jaundice for a duration of four weeks. Laboratory tests showed a cholestatic pattern and elevated carbohydrate antigen 19-9. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) demonstrated marked dilation of the common bile duct with abrupt distal tapering, mild pancreatic duct dilation, and a periampullary diverticulum, suggesting a periampullary neoplastic lesion or fibrotic stenosis. An ERCP was performed for diagnostic clarification and potential therapeutic decompression. Difficult cannulation required a precut sphincterotomy, after which a duodenal perforation was suspected. Post-procedure, the patient developed extensive subcutaneous, retroperitoneal, and mediastinal emphysema, pneumopericardium, and bilateral pneumothoraces. A CT confirmed free intraperitoneal air and contrast extravasation in the retroperitoneal space anterior to the left renal fascia, consistent with a perforation of the third portion of the duodenum. Emergency laparotomy identified and repaired the defect with a Graham patch. Despite intensive care with broad-spectrum antimicrobials and vasopressors, the patient developed septic shock and multi-organ failure and died nine days later. This case underscores the catastrophic potential of ERCP-related duodenal perforation and the importance of early CT diagnosis and individualized intervention in high-risk patients."

    "abstract": "Fulminant amebiasis is a rare, potentially lethal condition caused by Entamoeba histolytica. It causes intestinal perforation and generalized peritonitis, and treatment requires an emergency operation and the administration of anti-amoebic drugs. Although E. histolytica infections are more commonly reported in men who have sex with men, we report a successfully treated case of fulminant amebiasis in a female commercial sex worker (CSW). This report presents a review of previously reported cases. A 41-year-old woman with a 4-year history as a CSW presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and diarrhea. She was admitted with acute colitis of unknown etiology. Stool tests performed after admission revealed E. histolytica, confirming the diagnosis of amoebic colitis, and treatment with metronidazole was initiated. On day 8 of treatment, the patient's respiratory status worsened. Abdominal CT revealed a perforation of the transverse colon, leading to the diagnosis of fulminant amebiasis. Emergency laparotomy including subtotal colectomy and ileostomy was performed. Postoperatively, the patient's condition gradually improved without complications, and she was discharged on POD 97 after finding housing. We reviewed and analyzed 52 reported cases of fulminant amebiasis, including the present case, treated with bowel resection in Japan since 2000. According to our literature review, the mortality rate was 28.8% and only 9.6% of patients were diagnosed with amebiasis at the time of hospital admission. Gastrointestinal perforation or necrosis requiring surgical intervention occurred after admission in 72.9% of patients. The mortality rate was 23.0% in patients who received anti-amoebic agents preoperatively compared to 30.7% in those who did not. Notably, the mortality rate reached 100% for patients where anti-amoebic agents were not administered, suggesting that such treatment is essential for survival (p = 0.005). Here, we present a successfully treated case of fulminant amebiasis in a female CSW. Analysis of previously reported cases suggests that the early administration of anti-amoebic agents is important for survival."

The reported prevalence rate of phytobezoars is estimated to be 0.4% despite being the 5th most common cause of acute small bowel obstruction. A previously healthy five-year-old girl presented to the Emergency Medicine Department with a 5-day history of nonprojectile, nonbile stained vomiting, abdominal pain, and decreased urine output. Physical examinations revealed severe dehydration symptoms, and laboratory tests indicated abnormal electrolyte levels and metabolic alkalosis. The patient experienced a seizure, received medical interventions, and was diagnosed with mechanical intestinal obstruction due to a phytobezoar. After stabilization, she underwent surgical removal of the phytobezoar without complications and followed postoperative advice successfully. In cases without significant complications, surgical or aggressive medical treatment for bezoars may be unnecessary. Coca-Cola, alone or combined with endoscopic methods, is effective in dissolving gastric phytobezoars, with success rates exceeding 90%. Conservative management involves proteolytic enzymes, cellulase, carbonated beverages, and endoscopic fragmentation. Clinicians should stay vigilant, as small bowel obstruction can occur up to 6 weeks later. Prokinetic agents and dietary guidelines help minimize bezoar formation. Surgical intervention, unlikely to address the root cause and potentially worsening motility issues, requires careful consideration. Phytobezoars are a significant consideration in pediatric small bowel obstruction cases. Conducting a thorough dietary history, focusing on fiber-rich foods, is crucial. Radiographic and endoscopic studies aid in locating the phytobezoar. Timely surgical intervention is essential to prevent complications associated with small bowel obstruction."

    "abstract": "Background  Sigmoid volvulus causes colonic obstruction and ischemia. Urgent surgery is required for colonic necrosis or perforation, whereas prophylactic surgery is recommended after endoscopic treatment in nonemergency cases. However, many patients with sigmoid volvulus only undergo endoscopic treatment, highlighting a gap between guideline recommendations and clinical practice. We aimed to elucidate the actual management and outcomes of sigmoid volvulus in hospitalized patients to reconsider the disadvantages of delaying prophylactic surgery. Methods  We retrospectively recruited patients with sigmoid volvulus who were treated at the Hoshigaoka Medical Center between January 2013 and September 2024. Participant demographics and outcomes were analyzed, and the probability of remaining recurrence-free was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare paired samples. Results  We enrolled 28 participants with sigmoid volvulus. Of these, 15 (53%) had a medical history of cerebral stroke, and 12 (42%) were institutionalized. No participants who underwent surgery experienced recurrence, whereas 10 (62%) of 16 participants who received only endoscopic treatment did. Among patients with recurrence, one died as a result. Body weight, serum albumin level, geriatric nutritional risk index, and prognostic nutritional index were significantly lower at the time of recurrence than at the first hospitalization. No deaths occurred due to postoperative complications. Conclusions Sigmoid volvulus frequently recurs after endoscopic treatment alone, posing a life-threatening risk with each recurrence. Most patients with sigmoid volvulus are frail, and their nutritional status often deteriorates before recurrence occurs. Prophylactic surgery should therefore be planned for sigmoid volvulus soon after endoscopic treatment for the first time."

The ANSUR surgical unit (ASAHI INTECC CO., LTD., Aichi, Japan) is a new collaborative assistant robot equipped with three arms. However, no studies have reported on ANSUR, and its clinical advantages remain unclear. We retrospectively evaluated the data of 145 patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy and 261 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, in both elective and emergency settings, at our institution between January 2023 and June 2025. ANSUR-assisted laparoscopic appendectomy was performed in 30 of 145 patients, and ANSUR-assisted laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 36 of 261 patients. In laparoscopic appendectomy, the proportion of complicated appendicitis in the ANSUR-assisted LS group was significantly lower than that in the conventional LS group (p = 0.006). However, no significant differences in the perioperative outcomes were observed between the two groups. In laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the proportion of emergency ANSUR-assisted LS cases was lower than that of conventional LS (p = 0.041). The intraoperative and postoperative outcomes of ANSUR-assisted LS were comparable to those of conventional LS. No conversion to open surgery occurred in either ANSUR-assisted laparoscopic appendectomy or cholecystectomy. The median setup time—defined as the interval between ANSUR roll-in and the start of surgery—was 5 min for laparoscopic appendectomy and 8 min for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. ANSUR is a feasible, preliminary, and safe collaborative assistive robot for laparoscopic appendectomy and cholecystectomy. Additionally, ANSUR is expected to have clinical benefit in reducing healthcare manpower constrains. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11701-025-03102-w."

    "title": "Challenges and Outcomes of Three Years of the Adhesive Intestinal Obstruction Management Protocol.",
    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a significant contributor to surgical morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs, contributing to a significant number of emergency laparotomies. Advancements in diagnostic techniques have improved the accuracy in delineating simple from complicated SBOs. Some adhesive SBOs will ultimately need surgical intervention, mostly when they are complicated cases. Recently, minimally invasive surgeries, enhanced recovery protocols, and multidisciplinary approaches have become more popular in optimising recovery and minimising recurrence risks. On the other hand, most adhesive SBOs can be managed conservatively with bowel rest, nasogastric (NG) decompression, intravenous fluid therapy, and water-soluble oral contrast agents, leading to a significant reduction in operation-related morbidity, hospital stays, and healthcare costs. Current guidelines recommend a trial of conservative management, although not without controversy. This study aimed to explain the predictive factors of success or failure of treatments of adhesive SBOs and statistically report the effect of co-morbidities and expected outcomes of SBO management, based on three-year data from a single high-volume centre in London, UK. Our retrospective-descriptive study included patients with clinical signs of SBO, older than 16 years old, and CT proving adhesive SBO, who required hospital admission. We excluded patients with other causes of SBO and those who had no CT evidence of adhesive disease. Data were collected from online hospital records and analysed in Microsoft Excel® (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington). Hospital protocol was NG decompression for at least six hours in uncomplicated cases, followed by oral or NG Gastrografin, with abdominal X-rays taken at six and 12 hours post-Gastrografin intake to assess contrast in the colon or rectum. Successful cases were then given a trial of oral feeds before discharge. Those with no contrast in the large intestine, persistent abdominal pain, and onset abdominal tenderness or peritonitis were taken to surgery. Out of 415 patients, 30.4% required surgery either as initial mode of treatment or after failed conservative management, proving the effectivity of therapeutic Gastrografin (69.6%), followed by 35.2% being 75 or less years old, proving SBO is more prevalent in elderly population with co-morbidities, as 40.5% are ASA Grade 3, prone to post-operative complications. Surprisingly, COPD patients required surgery more often than those who did not have it, as they desaturate due to distension easily. On the other hand, not much statistical difference is seen in the 30-day mortality rate between the operated and conservatively managed groups. Our study aligns with the literature to prove that our management protocol is safe. Alongside, the post-operative burden of those undergoing surgery is high; it is vital to identify complex patients for surgery to reduce mortality and morbidity. This goes hand in hand with weighing risks and benefits. Elderly patients carry the risk of major complications plus a higher mortality rate. Timely intervention with therapeutic Gastrografin can minimise the hospital stay and the costs for the NHS owing to long stay post-operatively."

Clinical disparities regarding right and LCD also led to the differences in the incidences of both emergency surgery and future elective surgery. To evaluate the clinical features of CD, display the differences according to colonic localizations, and present treatment approaches. This was a retrospective study from a single centre analysing data from a prospective database. The 253 patients with history of hospitalization for CD were included and divided into two groups: RCD and LCD. To compare the differences between the two groups, the Student's t-test was used when the parametric test prerequisites were fulfilled, and the Mann-Whitney U test was used when such requirements were not fulfilled. The 208 (82.2%) patients were found to have LCD, and 45 (17.8%) had RCD. The majority of the patients had Hinchey 1A diverticulitis (49.8%). Male gender was significantly more common in patients who underwent surgery for LCD. While persistent abdominal pain was the main prior finding in the conservative treatment of both localizations, surgery was most performed due to abscess in RCD and perforation in LCD. The presence of an accompanying malignancy during colonoscopy was significantly more common in LCD cases who underwent surgery. Hartmann's procedure was the most performed technique in emergency settings (56.3%), while laparoscopic colectomy with anastomosis was in elective settings (53.9%). In addition, surgery was found to prolong the mean length of hospital stay in LCD patients. Although diverticulitis is a benign condition, the need for an individualized and evidence-based approach makes management challenging. Localization of the disease has an important role in determining the appropriate treatment."

    "title": "Crohn's Disease Diagnosed Intraoperatively During a Trauma Exploratory Laparotomy.",
    "abstract": "Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease, commonly presents with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss, typically leading to diagnosis through endoscopic or imaging studies. Its incidental discovery during emergent trauma surgery is rare. We report the case of a 25-year-old male who sustained blunt abdominal trauma in a dirt-bike accident, presenting to the emergency department the same day with progressive abdominal pain. Emergent exploratory laparotomy for a suspected bowel perforation revealed characteristic \"creeping fat,\" inflammatory adhesions, and an enterocolonic fistula, suggesting undiagnosed Crohn's disease. The presence of acute inflammation necessitated extended small bowel resection and precluded primary anastomosis. Postoperatively, the patient developed recurrent intra-abdominal abscesses, including a subhepatic collection measuring 5.7 × 2.6 × 5 cm, as well as pleural effusions, necessitating multiple drainage procedures, targeted antibiotics, and nutritional optimization. A multidisciplinary team-including trauma surgeons, gastroenterologists, infectious disease specialists, and interventional radiologists-collaborated to manage both acute injuries and the newly recognized chronic inflammatory condition. Final pathology revealed multifocal colonic mucosal ulceration with acute inflammation, ileocolic fistula formation, and colonic perforation, consistent with a penetrating (fistulizing) phenotype, ileocolonic Crohn's disease. This case illustrates the importance of maintaining a broad diagnostic perspective during trauma surgery and highlights how an unrecognized inflammatory bowel disease can complicate postoperative recovery. Early suspicion and tailored interventions are crucial for mitigating complications such as abscess formation and sepsis. A prompt gastroenterology consult and confirmatory investigations are recommended to guide long-term management of Crohn's disease. Ultimately, this report underscores that vigilance for atypical findings in emergent settings can significantly improve patient outcomes."

    "title": "The CHANSE score: a novel clinical tool incorporating the heel drop test for the diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis.",
    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is one of the most common abdominal surgical emergencies in children presenting to the emergency department. Although clinical guidelines emphasize combining symptom characteristics, physical examination findings, and inflammatory markers for accurate diagnosis, pediatric presentations are often atypical and overlap with other conditions. Classic physical signs such as the obturator, psoas, and Rovsing's signs have limited predictive value. The heel drop test has been reported to outperform rebound tenderness in detecting intraperitoneal inflammation, as it is more objective and less susceptible to misinterpretation. However, evidence regarding its diagnostic utility in appendicitis is limited, and its clinical application in pediatric patients has not been specifically examined. To evaluate the clinical utility of the heel drop test for diagnosing appendicitis in children and to develop a novel clinical scoring system that incorporates this test. We conducted a prospective observational study at a tertiary pediatric emergency center between August 2021 and August 2023. Children with suspected appendicitis underwent standardized clinical and laboratory evaluation, including the heel drop test. Variables significantly associated with appendicitis were identified and used to create a new scoring system (CHANSE: CRP elevation, Heel drop test positivity, Anorexia, Nausea or vomiting, Shift to the left, Elevated WBC). Diagnostic performance was assessed and compared with the Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS) using ROC analysis. Among 142 enrolled children, 84 were diagnosed with appendicitis. A positive heel drop test was significantly more common in the appendicitis group and showed diagnostic performance comparable to cough/percussion/hopping tenderness. The CHANSE score demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy compared with PAS (AUC 0.794 vs. 0.763, p < 0.001). A CHANSE score ≥3 showed predictive characteristics similar to a PAS cutoff ≥7. Higher CHANSE scores were also associated with complicated appendicitis. The heel drop test is a useful and objective physical examination method for diagnosing pediatric appendicitis. The CHANSE score, which incorporates this test, is a simple and reliable tool with diagnostic performance comparable to or better than PAS. It may also assist in identifying complicated appendicitis and support timely clinical decision-making."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis represents a prevalent surgical emergency globally, posing a significant risk of severe complications. These complications encompass a spectrum of conditions, including ileus, peritonitis, abscess formation, and, in extreme cases, mortality. The present study aims to assess the association of existing risk scores for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis and patient characteristics with the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, the odds of operative vs non-operative management, and postoperative outcomes. In total, 109 patients assessed for acute appendicitis were included in this study. Sex (p = 0.99, OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.87-1.17) and age (p = 0.23, OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.98-1.04) were not found to be significantly associated with the diagnosis of appendicitis. Patients with radiating pain were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with appendicitis compared to those with localized pain (p = 4.05 × 10-6, RR = 0.0918, 95% CI: 0.039-0.217). The duration of symptoms did not significantly influence the diagnosis (p = 0.12, RR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.98-1.11). Increased ALVARADO scores were significantly associated with operative treatment, with patients receiving an appendicectomy having a mean score of 7.56 (SD 1.91) and patients undergoing conservative management having a mean score of 4.92 (SD 1.56) (p-value < 0.001). The results of this study highlight the importance of clinical presentation, physical examination findings, and specific laboratory markers in the diagnosis of appendicitis. While demographic factors and certain biomarkers did not show significant associations, the combination of clinical and laboratory data can aid in accurate diagnosis and timely intervention."

    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) is widely regarded as the gold standard for diagnosing acute appendicitis. However, the use of contrast agents may be contraindicated in patients with renal impairment or a history of allergic reactions. Non-contrast CT (NCCT) offers a potential alternative, but its diagnostic performance has been variably reported across studies. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the pooled diagnostic accuracy of NCCT in detecting acute appendicitis. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar from inception to June 2025. Studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of NCCT for acute appendicitis were included. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) curve were estimated using a bivariate random-effects model. Study quality was assessed with the QUADAS-2 tool, and publication bias was evaluated using Deeks' funnel plot asymmetry test. Results: Eleven studies comprising 1996 patients met the inclusion criteria. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of NCCT were 0.93 (95% confidence interval; CI, 0.91-0.95) and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.95-0.97), respectively. The area under the HSROC curve was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.83-0.96), indicating moderate diagnostic performance. Heterogeneity was moderate for sensitivity (I2 = 48.2%) and substantial for specificity (I2 = 77.6%), likely due to differences in study populations and CT acquisition protocols. No significant publication bias was detected (Deeks' test, p = 0.079). Conclusions: NCCT demonstrates moderate diagnostic accuracy for detecting acute appendicitis and offers a practical alternative for patients who cannot receive contrast media. Its safety and rapid applicability make NCCT a useful imaging option in emergency settings, especially when contrast use is limited."

    "title": "Outpatient Laparoscopic Appendectomy PI.",
    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is one of the most common reasons for emergency general surgery, with more than 1 in 20 Americans expected to develop it during their lifetime. Despite its prevalence, there is significant variability in the treatment of acute appendicitis, particularly in the use of antibiotics, imaging modalities, and length of hospital stay. In 2016, our military medical institution established a novel Emergency General Surgery Performance Improvement program. As part of this initiative, we developed disease-specific protocols, including an outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy (OLA) protocol, to reduce treatment variability, improve efficiency, and optimize the quality of patient care. This is a 5-yreview of our appendectomy protocol. Our institution implemented an OLA, which outlined specific imaging and antibiotic administration, and minimized the hospital length of stay to within 24 h. Data from patients undergoing OLA between 2017 and 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Exclusion criteria included age < 18 y, advanced appendicitis, immunosuppression, pregnancy, or lack of postdischarge supervision. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square tests. Continuous variables (age, time to operating room [OR]) were tested for normality with the Shapiro-Wilk test and reported as median (Q1, Q3). Nonparametric comparisons across years used the Kruskal-Wallis test; 2020 (signage posted) was compared to other years using the Mann-Whitney U test. Significance was set at P < 0.05. A total of 104 patients met inclusion criteria (median age 35 y; 60% male). Antibiotic compliance ranged from 56% to 93%, and imaging compliance from 75% to 100%, both varying significantly over time (P = 0.014 and P = 0.039, respectively). Median time to OR remained stable at 7.0 h (interquartile range 6.0-10.0), with no significant yearly difference (P = 0.29). In 2020, signage was associated with higher antibiotic (P = 0.001) and imaging compliance (P = 0.001), but not shorter time to OR (P = 0.35). Complications were rare (2%). Despite variations in antibiotic and imaging compliance, key surgical outcomes, including time to the OR and hospital length of stay, remained stable. Signage reinforced protocol adherence, highlighting the importance of ongoing education. The low complication rate supports the overall safety of laparoscopic appendectomy. Future efforts should focus on improving compliance and optimizing preoperative workflows to enhance patient care."

While typically occurring in the early postoperative period, such complications can also manifest months or even years after the original surgery, necessitating emergency intervention. A laparoscopic approach should be considered for cases of small bowel obstruction caused by a foreign body, with careful preoperative planning to reduce recovery time and length of hospital stay. We report a case involving a 29-year-old man with a history of open appendicectomy during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. He presented with symptoms of small bowel obstruction. Imaging revealed a radio-opaque object suggestive of retained surgical material. Emergency diagnostic laparoscopy revealed a retained gauze encapsulated within a cystic structure causing a closed-loop obstruction. The foreign body was successfully removed laparoscopically without bowel resection. This case highlights the importance of awareness and preparedness for late-presenting surgical complications."

    "abstract": "Although colonic and duodenal diverticulosis is common, ileal diverticular disease is rare. The pathophysiology of ileal diverticula is poorly understood, but the most widely accepted hypothesis currently suggests abnormalities in the myenteric plexus or smooth muscle, high intraluminal pressure, and intestinal dyskinesia. Diagnosis is often delayed and difficult because the clinical presentation is nonspecific, and it is mainly imaging that allows the diagnosis to be established and guided. In the event of complications such as perforation, it can be life-threatening because of delays in diagnosis and treatment. We present an interesting case of ileal diverticulitis that posed a diagnostic and treatment challenge. A 76-year-old man presented to the emergency department with severe pain in the right iliac fossa that had been developing for 5 days. Once diagnosed, ileal diverticulitis must be managed according to the same therapeutic principles as sigmoid diverticulitis, as was the case for our patient. A misdiagnosis, with low prevalence and nonspecific symptoms, can lead to errors or delays in treatment. Our case shows the importance of having an accurate diagnosis of acute gastrointestinal pathologies before beginning treatment."

    "abstract": "Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (PCI) is an uncommon complaint that can produce free gas below the diaphragm, mimicking gastrointestinal perforation, which can easily lead to misdiagnosis. Although prognosis is generally good in most cases, complications can pose a threat to life and may require surgical intervention. Currently, clear surgical guidelines for PCI complicated by colonic perforation are lacking. We present the case of a 57-year-old male patient with pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis complicated by colonic perforation. The patient was admitted because of persistent upper abdominal pain for 3 days, which worsened over 5 hours. The client suffered from a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary bullae, and heart failure. Emergency surgery was performed, during which severe abdominal contamination, significant colon dilation, cystic bubbles in the intestinal wall, and perforation of the splenic flexure of the transverse colon were observed. Consequently, the doctors performed partial colectomy and colostomy. Postoperatively, due to recurrent fever symptoms, he was transferred to a higher-level hospital for further treatment and was ultimately discharged successfully. PCI combined with colonic perforation should be regarded as a routine differential diagnosis for urgent abdominal pain. Although conservative treatment is the preferred option in most cases, timely surgical intervention should be considered in the presence of complications, hemodynamic instability, signs of peritonitis, and significant abnormal laboratory and imaging findings. Based on the current evidence, partial colectomy with colostomy is recommended for patients undergoing PCI combined with colonic perforation."

We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of pediatric patients with volvulus caused by mesenteric lymphangioma. Between January 1994 to August 2024, 28 pediatric patients were diagnosed with bowel volvulus attributable to mesenteric lymphangioma. Age, sex, clinical manifestations, ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) findings, operative findings, treatment, complications, and follow-up outcomes were reviewed retrospectively. The cohort comprised 13 boys and 15 girls, with 71.4% being preschool-aged. Most patients (21/28, 75%) sought medical attention within 24 hours of symptom onset. Clinical signs and symptoms were nonspecific and resembled those of intestinal obstruction. Ultrasound detected mesenteric lymphangioma in 26 patients, and CT identified it in all 28 patients; the \"whirlpool sign\" was observed in 24 and 27 patients, respectively. All patients underwent emergency laparotomy. Intestinal necrosis occurred in 5 cases and was associated with longer consultation delays (P = .008) and higher degrees of rotation (P = .008). Surgical procedures included resection of the affected intestinal segment with end-to-end anastomosis (20 patients), tumor enucleation (6 patients), and marsupialization with endometrial cauterization 2 patients. Postoperative complications consisted of bowel obstruction and incision infection in 2 patients. No recurrences were noted during follow-up. Volvulus secondary to mesenteric lymphangioma is a rare condition that presents with nonspecific clinical features. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain in children."

    "abstract": "Cecal volvulus is a rare cause of acute abdominal pain, resulting from torsion of the cecum and ascending colon due to abnormal mobility caused by inadequate peritoneal fixation. Clinical presentation is often vague and nonspecific, which can delay diagnosis and treatment. Computed tomography (CT) is the imaging modality of choice, as it not only confirms the presence and location of the volvulus but also identifies serious complications such as ischemia or perforation. Abdominal radiographs may be inconclusive, especially when the twisted bowel loop is fluid-filled, aligned antero-posteriorly, or obscured by adjacent gas-filled loops. We present the case of a 65-year-old woman who arrived at the emergency department with sudden-onset abdominal pain. Abdominal CT revealed classic signs of cecal volvulus, including the rarely reported 'embryo sign,' which proved crucial for swift diagnosis and intervention. Recognizing both common and less common CT features, such as the embryo sign, is paramount for rapid diagnosis and appropriate management in emergency situations. Familiarity with the full radiologic spectrum of this condition can significantly improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Background: Biliary peritonitis is a severe intra-abdominal emergency with high mortality. Effective management requires source control and appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Methods: This review synthesizes recent literature (2016-2025), as well as established guidelines recommendations on the evolving microbiology and antimicrobial resistance patterns in biliary tract infections, as data on biliary peritonitis is scarce and relatively heterogeneous. Results: The microbiological landscape is stratified by patient history. Community-acquired infections are typically caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterococcus spp. In contrast, healthcare-associated infections show a shift, with highly resistant pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and a tendency towards polymicrobial infections. The rise of multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms, including extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales, Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), and Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE), is a critical challenge limiting therapeutic options. Resistance patterns vary geographically, necessitating the use of local data. Conclusions: This review argues for a paradigm shift from severity-based guidelines to a dual-axis model incorporating resistance risk factors (prior healthcare exposure, previous biliary interventions, a history of MDR infections). We propose a risk-stratified approach to empiric antibiotic selection, emphasizing microbiological diagnostics for therapy de-escalation. Future research should focus on prospective studies, novel antibiotics, and rapid diagnostics."

    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: The increasing use of endovascular procedures with common femoral artery (CFA) access has led to a rise in iatrogenic arterial injuries at this site. The most frequent injuries are pseudoaneurysms (PSA), retrograde dissections (RD), arteriovenous fistulas (AVF), and arterial perforations. Surgical repair is the standard treatment; however, the use of covered stents (CS) may represent a valid alternative, despite current instructions for use (IFU) not recommending CFA implantation. Methods: We conducted a single-center retrospective study on a prospectively maintained database. Patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve repair (TAVR), endovascular aortic repair EVAR, diagnostic or therapeutic coronary angiography, or peripheral percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, who were subsequently treated for CFA injury with CS implantation between February 2015 and May 2024, were included. Endpoints were technical success (complete arterial repair), 30-day mortality, overall mortality, reintervention rates, and long-term stent patency. Results: A total of 41 patients were included: 10 (24.4%) PSA, 3 (7.3%) AVF, 27 (65.8%) perforations, and 2 (4.9%) RD. Of which 28 (68.3%) were treated with self-expandable CS and 13 (31.7%) with balloon-expandable CS. Additionally, 33 (80.5%) underwent urgent treatment. Technical success was achieved in 97.5%. Thirty-day mortality was 7.3%, with no procedure-related deaths. At a mean follow-up of 50.8 months (range 1-109), survival was 63.4%, with 100% stent patency and no procedure-related reinterventions. Conclusions: CS implantation for CFA iatrogenic injuries achieved high technical success and excellent long-term patency, representing a viable alternative to open repair. Further studies are needed to integrate CS use for CFA injuries into treatment algorithms and to update device IFUs accordingly."

    "abstract": "The vermiform appendix is prone to various diseases, with acute appendicitis (AA) being the most common. The increasing incidence in Nigeria complicates diagnosis, leading to negative appendectomies. Accurate and timely diagnosis, along with routine histopathological examination, is essential for effective patient care. To investigate changes in the pathology of surgically removed appendix tissue from our center over 16 years, establish temporal trends in the incidence of appendicitis, and determine if findings regarding appendiceal pathology hold over time. This study analyzed appendectomy samples obtained between 2008 and 2023 at Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), Nigeria. Emergency, incidental, and interval appendectomies were included; incomplete records were excluded. The samples were fixed in formalin, sectioned, stained, and examined to confirm the histopathological diagnosis. Special stains were applied for unusual findings. This study analyzed 1,467 appendicectomy specimens with a sex ratio of 1.25:1 and a mean age of 24.3 years (range: 4 days-94 years). The 10-19 years age group had the highest proportion (22.8%). Most surgeries were emergencies (72.0%), with 52.5% confirmed as AA, and perforation was most frequent in the 10-19 age group. Other findings included lymphoid hyperplasia (29.4%) and a 7.6% negative appendectomy rate. The number of appendectomies varied annually, with a decline in total cases and confirmed AA cases from 2020 to 2023. This 16-year review reveals evolving trends in appendiceal pathology at a tropical tertiary center, including an increase in younger patients, a reduction in sex disparity, and improved diagnostic accuracy. While AA remains predominant, frequent unexpected findings underscore the value of routine histological examinations."

    "abstract": "The global population is aging rapidly, leading to a significant increase in geriatric patients requiring emergency surgical intervention. This demographic presents unique challenges due to high frailty, multisystem comorbidities, and atypical disease presentations, which contribute to elevated surgical risks and poorer outcomes compared to younger populations. This review aims to synthesize the current research landscape regarding emergency general surgical conditions in older adults. It focuses on the common disease spectrum, evolving management strategies, and critical prognostic determinants to inform and enhance evidence-based clinical practice. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to delineate the etiology of acute abdomen in the elderly, evaluate the utility of preoperative assessment tools and surgical approaches, and identify key factors influencing patient outcomes, including mortality and complication rates. Acute appendicitis, intestinal obstruction, gastrointestinal perforation, and biliary diseases represent the most prevalent conditions. Precise preoperative risk stratification using scoring systems like POSSUM is crucial. For hemodynamically stable patients, a laparoscopic-first approach is associated with reduced complications and shorter hospital stays. Prognosis is critically influenced not just by age, but more significantly by frailty, multimorbidity, and psychosocial factors. The integration of Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) models and rehabilitation medicine principles is pivotal for optimizing comprehensive care. The management of geriatric emergency surgical patients necessitates a tailored, multidimensional strategy. Future efforts to improve outcomes should focus on refined preoperative optimization, the promotion of minimally invasive techniques, and the systematic implementation of multidisciplinary collaboration and early rehabilitation."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous neonatal gastric perforation (SNGP) is an extremely rare but life-threatening surgical emergency. Open surgery has been the traditional mainstay of treatment, whereas reports on laparoscopic repair in neonates remain scarce. This report delineates a successful case of laparoscopic repair for SNGP in a newborn. We herein detail the surgical technique and elucidate the advantages of this minimally invasive approach over conventional open surgery. A 34-week premature male neonate, with a birth weight of 2550 grams and born to a G6P4 mother, was admitted presenting with a one-day history of vomiting and abdominal distension. An abdominal x-ray obtained at a referring hospital demonstrated pneumoperitoneum, suggestive of neonatal gastrointestinal perforation. Upon transfer to our institution, a repeat abdominal x-ray revealed massive subdiaphragmatic free air, elevated diaphragmatic arches, and central clustering of bowel loops, constituting the classic \"football sign.\" A preliminary diagnosis of spontaneous neonatal gastric perforation was established. The patient subsequently underwent emergent laparoscopic repair of the gastric perforation. Postoperatively, he was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for close monitoring. Full enteral feeding was gradually reestablished, commencing on the seventh postoperative day. In this case, a newborn with SNGP was successfully managed via laparoscopic repair. This case underscores the potential of minimally invasive techniques for managing this condition. The laparoscopic approach provided superior visualization of the gastric fundus and facilitated enhanced vessel mobilization compared to open surgery. The patient's uneventful postoperative recovery exemplifies the documented advantages of laparoscopy, including reduced tissue trauma, diminished postoperative pain, and a more rapid recovery. We therefore conclude that, for hemodynamically stable neonates in centers with appropriate surgical expertise, laparoscopic repair represents a viable and advantageous alternative to open surgery."

    "title": "Paediatric Appendicectomy in a UK District General Hospital: Retrospective Analysis of Laparoscopic Versus Open Approaches Performed by Non-Paediatric Specialist General Surgeons.",
    "abstract": "Background Acute appendicitis remains the most frequent paediatric surgical emergency worldwide. Although laparoscopic appendicectomy has progressively supplanted the traditional open approach in specialist paediatric centres, evidence regarding its outcomes in non-specialist District General Hospitals remains limited. In such settings, appendicectomies in children are frequently performed by general surgeons, introducing potential variability in outcomes related to surgeon experience and institutional resources. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust, United Kingdom. All patients aged ≤16 years who underwent emergency appendicectomy for suspected acute appendicitis between 1st January 2016 and 31st August 2025 were included. The primary outcome was the immediate postoperative complications within the same admission and a 30-day postoperative admission rate, including surgical site infection, intra-abdominal abscess, and postoperative ileus. Secondary outcomes included operative duration, length of hospital stay, and conversion rate. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v28.0. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 254 paediatric patients underwent appendicectomy for suspected acute appendicitis between January 2016 and August 2025. Following exclusion of incomplete records, 237 patients were included in the final analysis, comprising 199 (84.0%) open appendicectomies (OA), 36 (15.2%) laparoscopic appendicectomies (LA), and 2 (0.8%) laparoscopic procedures converted to open. The mean patient age was 10.9 ± 2.7 years, with a male predominance (63.3%). The mean American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade was 1.21 in the OA group and 1.25 in the LA group. Preoperative imaging was performed in 101 (42.6%) cases, most commonly ultrasound, with comparable diagnostic accuracy between groups (p = 0.99). The mean operative duration was 70.0 minutes, with median durations of 63.8, 97.2, and 195.0 minutes for open, laparoscopic, and converted cases, respectively. Complicated appendicitis occurred in 58 (28.9%) OA and 10 (27.8%) LA cases (p = 0.89). Drain placement was required in 26 (12.9%) OA and 7 (19.4%) LA cases (p = 0.31). The overall postoperative complication rate was 23 (9.7%), most frequently due to postoperative ileus (8 (3.4%)) and intra-abdominal abscess (8 (3.4%)), with no significant difference between surgical approaches. The 30-day readmission rate was 26 (10.9%), predominantly for intra-abdominal collections (10 (4.2%)) and postoperative pain (7 (3.0%)). The negative appendicectomy rate was 13 (5.5%), lower than national averages (~10-13%). The majority of procedures (174 (73.4%)) were performed by registrars under consultant supervision, reflecting the reproducibility of both approaches in a training environment. No intraoperative access-related complications or major adverse events were recorded. Conclusion Laparoscopic appendicectomy performed by general surgeons in a District General Hospital is safe and effective for paediatric patients, demonstrating outcomes comparable to open surgery with low complication and negative appendicectomy rates. The high proportion of registrar-performed procedures highlights its reproducibility in a training environment. These findings support the routine use of laparoscopic appendicectomy in non-specialist centres with appropriate training and resources."

    "abstract": "A patient arrived at the emergency department by ambulance with a gunshot wound to the chest. Concern for tracheal injury was confirmed by imaging, also revealing perforation of the endotracheal tube through the tracheal defect. In the operating room (OR), a fiberoptic bronchoscope was used to visualize the airway, revealing that ventilation was solely occurring through Murphy's eye, which was incidentally lined up with the tracheal defect. A fiberoptic scope was used to reposition the endotracheal tube distal to the injury, securing the airway. This case demonstrates the utility of Murphy's eye and the indispensable role of fiberoptic bronchoscopy in airway navigation."

    "title": "Non-traumatic Tension Faecopneumothorax: A Rare Complication of Intrathoracic Colonic Perforation.",
    "abstract": "Tension faecopneumothorax is an exceptionally rare and life-threatening condition, typically resulting from bowel herniation through the diaphragm with intrathoracic perforation. Although diaphragmatic hernias can be congenital, traumatic, or iatrogenic, colonic herniation and subsequent perforation into the thoracic cavity are exceedingly uncommon and diagnostically challenging. We report the case of a 53-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and a recent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, admitted to the emergency department (ED) with severe respiratory distress. Despite multiple prior visits to the ED with nonspecific symptoms, this time the patient presented in shock. Chest radiography revealed a left-sided tension pneumothorax, and insertion of a chest tube resulted in the unexpected drainage of feculent material. Computed tomography confirmed a left hydropneumothorax secondary to central diaphragmatic hernia with intrathoracic colonic perforation. Emergency surgery included segmental colectomy with colostomy, diaphragmatic repair, and chest tube placement. Postoperatively, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit with septic shock. Despite subsequent improvement, a secondary empyema necessitated repeat drainage. Persistent infection and loss of lung viability led to left lower lobectomy. After 65 days of hospitalization and a multidisciplinary approach involving intensivists and surgical teams, the patient was discharged with a favorable clinical evolution. This case highlights the diagnostic complexity and severity of tension faecopneumothorax due to colonic perforation in a diaphragmatic hernia, particularly in the absence of trauma. It underscores the importance of considering atypical etiologies in patients with unexplained respiratory distress and the need for prompt imaging, surgical intervention, and comprehensive intensive care. Given the rarity of such presentations, reporting these cases contributes to improved clinical awareness and management strategies."

    "abstract": "Acute care settings, including emergency medicine and intensive care units, comprise a substantial portion of healthcare and are essential in the prompt management of conditions that can prove fatal. Critical care conditions require timely management that can be delayed by high patient volumes and the need for complex clinical decision making. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools have been created to enhance diagnostic accuracy and optimize workflow to improve patient care. This narrative review discusses the current status of AI in acute care, with a focus on its applications in triaging and diagnosis. AI-enhanced electrocardiogram analysis, identification of myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndrome, and heart failure risk stratification led to better patient-specific management and improved results. AI models successfully determined and aided in the timely management of various acute conditions, including pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and respiratory failure. The AI algorithms used accurately determined sepsis onset and course, superseding traditionally used clinical tools and leading to early diagnosis and reduced sepsis mortality. These models showed high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing and triaging neurological conditions, including altered levels of consciousness, seizures, and intracranial hemorrhages. AI that involved advanced machine learning imaging software led to faster and more accurate stroke diagnosis. Diagnostic tools assisted by AI improved the detection and classification of acute pancreatitis, appendicitis, and gastrointestinal bleeding. AI has shown promising results in optimizing management in acute care settings. However, critical issues in data standardization, ethical considerations, and clinical workflow integration need to be addressed to enable clinical implementation."

    "abstract": "Historically, high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures such as rotational atherectomy (RA) required on-site surgical backup. However, advancements in PCI techniques, coupled with the geographic realities of Australia's dispersed population, warrant a reassessment of RA in the context of contemporary clinical practice. We aimed to establish the safety and outcomes after RA at non-surgical centres. Consecutive RA PCI cases from September 2012 to February 2024 at seven Australian hospitals without on-site cardiac surgery were analysed. Primary outcomes were referrals for emergency cardiac surgery (bailout) and 30-day mortality. A total of 943 patients (1,010 lesions) were included, with a mean age of 74.4±9.6 years. A total of 72.6% were male and the average body mass index was 28.7±7.1 kg/m2. Common comorbidities included diabetes (35.1%), a history of smoking (48.7%), and acute coronary syndrome or emergency presentation (32.9%). Off-site surgical bailout was necessary for four patients (0.4%) (temporary pacing wire-related right ventricular perforation with tamponade [n=2]; burr entrapment not retrievable percutaneously [n=2]). Major coronary perforations occurred in 0.8% (n=8; Ellis III). Minor perforations occurred in 2.3% (n=22). Tamponade occurred in eight (0.8%) patients. Burr entrapment occurred in six (0.6%) patients. A total of 32 patients (3.4%) died within 30 days of the procedure; 13 cases (1.4%) were PCI-related, but only eight of these (0.8%) were directly attributable to RA (significant ischaemia, e.g., no/slow reflow [n=4]; perforation with tamponade unable to be temporised percutaneously [n=2]; burr entrapment [n=1]; extensive coronary dissection [n=1]). Female sex and acute coronary syndrome presentation were predictors of poorer outcome. RA can be safely conducted without on-site surgical backup, including in regional Australian areas. In geographically dispersed populations, regional access to RA-assisted PCI is critical. Immediate percutaneous management remains the mainstay of management of rare but potentially severe complications such as tamponade, perforations, and burr entrapment."

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical features, comorbidities, inflammatory markers, and treatment regimens in adult FMF patients with and without concurrent CD. In this retrospective, multicenter, nationwide study, data were obtained from the Turkish Ministry of Health's National Electronic Database (e-Nabız). Diagnoses of FMF and CD were determined using ICD-10 codes and validated through clinical, serological, and histopathological records. A control group of FMF patients without CD was matched by age and sex. Demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, medication use, emergency visits, surgical history, and serum amyloid A levels were analyzed. Out of 184,786 adult FMF patients, 523 had coexisting CD and were compared with 523 matched FMF controls. Joint involvement rates were similar (p = 0.063), while comorbidities such as thyroid dysfunction, diabetes, depression (all p < 0.001), migraine (p = 0.009), and fibromyalgia (p= 0.003) were more prevalent in FMF-CD patients. Emergency visits for abdominal pain (p < 0.001) and peritonitis (p = 0.005) were significantly higher. Use of colchicine (compressed form), methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, and methylprednisolone was also elevated (all p < 0.05). Coexisting CD in FMF patients is associated with a higher comorbidity burden, increased indirect inflammation, and greater use of immunomodulatory drugs. These findings suggest a more complex clinical profile but are limited by the absence of standardized disease activity metrics. Prospective studies using validated indices are needed for clearer insight and tailored management."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis persists as one of the leading indications for emergency abdominal surgical intervention globally. Although its classic presentation is well described, atypical manifestations continue to present diagnostic difficulties and may contribute to delays in treatment and higher rates of complications. We describe a case involving a 21-year-old woman with no notable past medical history who presented with a six-hour history of left upper quadrant abdominal pain accompanied by nausea and anorexia. On examination, she exhibited localized abdominal tenderness without evidence of guarding or rebound. CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated an unusually elongated, retrocecal appendix extending superiorly, containing an obstructing appendicolith with surrounding inflammatory changes, findings consistent with acute appendicitis. The patient subsequently underwent an emergent laparoscopic appendectomy without complication. This case highlights the need for continued clinical vigilance when evaluating abdominal pain with nontraditional localization. In the presence of atypical symptoms, early cross-sectional imaging plays a crucial role in establishing a diagnosis, particularly in patients with anatomical variants, and may help reduce delays in definitive surgical intervention."

    "abstract": "Ocular injuries in combat or field environments, particularly those resulting from shrapnel or blast mechanisms, frequently cause penetrating globe trauma. These injuries pose an immediate and severe threat to ocular integrity and commonly result in significant visual impairment, including blindness or loss of the globe itself. The primary challenge in these scenarios is prompt identification of globe perforation through clinical assessment and imaging, followed by urgent surgical intervention. We report the case of a male patient in his twenties who was urgently referred to our center with suspected scleral perforation of the right eye. Such injuries typically involve intraocular or intraorbital foreign bodies and necessitate emergency surgery under general anesthesia, encompassing wound exploration, foreign body removal, and globe repair. This injury occurred due to an unexpected explosion of a rifle bullet buried beneath a cooking fire (\"poike\"). High-energy injuries of this nature usually carry a poor prognosis regarding vision and globe preservation. Remarkably, in this case, meticulous clinical examination, precise imaging and appropriate surgical technique, allowed successful management through a relatively minor procedure under local anesthesia. The patient made a full recovery without lasting ocular damage."

    "title": "The Silent Surge: A Case of Rhabdomyolysis-Induced Hypercalcemia.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Calcium is an essential extracellular cation that the body tightly regulates for numerous physiological functions. Rhabdomyolysis typically causes hypocalcemia due to calcium sequestration within damaged muscle tissue. However, in rare cases, it can progress to hypercalcemia, particularly during the recovery phase, often in patients with concurrent acute kidney injury. CASE REPORT A 48-year-old man with no prior medical or surgical history was admitted to the hospital after he had been found unresponsive at home. His initial toxicology screen revealed the presence of cocaine, fentanyl, and benzodiazepines. He was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis complicated by acute kidney injury and left upper arm compartment syndrome, requiring emergent fasciotomy and renal replacement therapy. During hospitalization, he developed peritonitis secondary to bowel perforation, which warranted laparotomy. Six weeks later, he presented with nausea, vomiting, and constipation, leading to diagnosis of severe hypercalcemia (serum calcium level, 15.3 mg/dL [reference, 8.9-10.2 mg/dL]; albumin-corrected calcium level, 16.7 mg/dL). The patient received intravenous fluids and diuretics, followed by denosumab, which resulted in normalization of calcium levels and resolution of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Rhabdomyolysis may initially present with severe hypocalcemia, followed by delayed hypercalcemia due to calcium sequestration and subsequent release from necrotic muscle tissue. In the present case, delayed hypercalcemia was successfully managed with intravenous fluids, diuretics, and denosumab. Recognition of this delayed pattern is critical for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management. Our patient exhibited a particularly delayed presentation of hypercalcemia and displayed an exceptionally high calcium level."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency, typically resulting from luminal obstruction caused by inspissated stool, lymphoid hyperplasia, vegetable seeds, parasites, or, rarely, foreign bodies. We report the case of a 10-year-old girl presenting with acute abdominal pain, nausea, and loss of appetite. Ultrasound and laboratory findings were diagnostic for acute appendicitis. Her previous urinary tract infection initially obscured the clinical picture, delaying suspicion of an alternative cause. The discovery of a metallic pin within the inflamed appendix highlights the importance of thorough evaluation when symptoms are atypical or recurrent. While CT scans are highly accurate for identifying ingested foreign objects, ultrasound remains a valuable radiation-free modality in pediatric patients. This case reinforces the need for prompt assessment of unusual abdominal symptoms and for considering foreign body ingestion in the differential diagnosis. It also underscores the importance of parental education to prevent accidental ingestion of sharp objects in children."

Left-sided acute appendicitis due to malrotation is an uncommon but important diagnostic pitfall. We present A 28-year-old woman with no past medical history who presented to the emergency department at our institution in August 2025 with a three-day history of progressive left-sided abdominal pain localized mainly to the left iliac fossa. Laboratory investigations revealed leukocytosis (WBC 15 × 109/L) with neutrophilia. Contrast-enhanced CT demonstrated intestinal malrotation with a reversed superior mesenteric artery/superior mesenteric vein relationship, large bowel predominantly on the left side, and a left-sided, inflamed appendix with minimal surrounding fat stranding, minimal pelvic free fluid, and small ovarian cysts. The solid abdominal organs were unremarkable. Laparoscopic exploration revealed an inflamed appendix in the left iliac fossa with a healthy cecum and bowel base. Laparoscopic appendectomy was performed without performing the Ladd's procedure. The postoperative course was uneventful, and histopathology confirmed acute appendicitis with focal serositis. Intestinal malrotation in adults can shift the appendix to the left hemipelvis, leading to left-sided abdominal pain and diagnostic delay. Recognition of imaging features is crucial for diagnosis and surgical planning. Laparoscopic appendectomy provides safe and effective management."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (AMN) is a rare tumor, representing 0.2-0.7% of all appendiceal neoplasms. Low-grade AMN (LAMN) occurs more often in women and is often misdiagnosed as appendicitis due to its vague symptoms. It involves mucin accumulation causing appendiceal dilation and carries a risk of pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP). Prognosis depends on disease extent, with survival rates declining once the tumor spreads beyond the appendix. During pregnancy, diagnosis is challenging because of non-specific symptoms and limited imaging options, highlighting the importance of clinical vigilance and thorough intraoperative evaluation to ensure timely diagnosis and management. CASE REPORT This report describes the case of a 45-year-old woman with LAMN, incidentally discovered during an elective cesarean section at 40 weeks of gestation, and is the first documented report of this type in Serbia. The patient was asymptomatic, with unremarkable prenatal screenings. Intraoperative inspection revealed approximately 400 ml of thick gelatinous material (PMP) in the abdominal cavity and a tumor-like mass on the appendix. Following the initial appendectomy and biopsy, confirmed LAMN and elevated CA125 led to a secondary operation: extended right hemicolectomy and total omentectomy. This procedure confirmed mucin dissemination, highlighting the urgent need for oncologic intervention despite the tumor's low grade. CONCLUSIONS Incidental discovery of LAMN during a cesarean section is extremely rare. This case demonstrates the need for intraoperative vigilance, thorough abdominal assessment, and multidisciplinary management to ensure accurate diagnosis and optimal outcomes for both mother and neonate in such complex situations."

This report aimed at discussing the applicability of anticoagulants alone as a conservative treatment strategy for patients with superior mesenteric artery (SMA) embolism. A 70-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia presented to our emergency department with persistent moderate-to-severe lower abdominal dull pain for three hours. Her vital signs and initial laboratory studies were normal. An enhanced abdominal computed tomographic scan revealed a filling defect in the SMA and an infarcted right kidney suggestive of a diagnosis of SMA embolism. An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation. Subsequent blood sampling demonstrated an elevated D-dimer level at 6.08 mg/L. Surgery was not indicated due to the absence of bowel necrosis or overt peritonitis. The patient was admitted to the cardiology ward, where anticoagulation therapy with a 5-day course of subcutaneous enoxaparin was started, followed by switching to oral edoxaban. The patient was discharged uneventfully 1 week after admission. Our unexpected discovery of a case of SMA embolism complicated with right renal infarction underscored the need for vigilance in identifying the condition through imaging studies, pinpointing the potential contributor (e.g., atrial fibrillation), and implementing appropriate treatment. Our case underscores the importance of anticoagulation once the diagnosis is made and the efficacy of conservative treatment in selected patients without signs of systemic inflammation or peritonitis."

    "abstract": "Enteric zoster, a rare herpes zoster manifestation, occurs when varicella-zoster virus (VZV) reactivates enteric nervous system neurons, leading to abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms without a cutaneous rash. Due to absence of the skin lesion, diagnosis is challenging. Recently, salivary VZV DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been suggested as a diagnostic test for herpes zoster. This investigation aimed to assess the prevalence of salivary VZV DNA positivity among patients with acute abdominal pain and to evaluate its diagnostic value by comparing PCR results in patients undergoing intra-abdominal surgery. We prospectively enrolled adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain between June 2023 and April 2024 at a community-based university hospital. The patients underwent detailed history reviews, blood tests, and abdominal computed tomography (CT). Salivary VZV DNA PCR was performed. Additionally, to investigate subclinical VZV reactivation under acute gastrointestinal stress, salivary VZV DNA PCR was conducted within 48 hour post-abdominal surgery as a control. Enteric zoster was inferred in individuals exhibiting positive salivary VZV DNA, identified through real-time PCR. In total, 101 patients with abdominal pain were enrolled. Positive salivary VZV DNA PCR results were found in 5 (5.0%) patients. Two patients had acute cholecystitis, one had acute appendicitis, one had acute pancreatitis, and the remaining patient had no identifiable cause of abdominal pain on CT. All 19 patients tested negative for salivary VZV DNA PCR post-abdominal surgery within 48 hours. About 5% of patients experiencing acute abdominal pain exhibited positive salivary VZV DNA PCR findings, indicating that enteric zoster may be a potential factor in both recognized and unidentified causes of acute abdominal pain. Further research is needed to determine if antiviral therapy guided by salivary VZV DNA PCR results can alleviate abdominal pain in this patient population."

In this study, we aimed to determine the surgical site infection rate in emergency abdominal surgery with primary wound closure and ordinary wound dressings in an advanced bundle care setting. Secondly, we aimed to identify risk factors for surgical site infection. A retrospective analysis of patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery for visceral perforation, ischemia, hemorrhage, bowel obstruction, or other urgent pathology with primary wound closure and use of standard surgical dressings was conducted in Copenhagen University Hospital North-Zealand, Denmark. 772 patients were analyzed. The overall surgical site infection rate was 12.6%. Patients undergoing an emergency laparoscopy had significantly less surgical site infection compared to open surgery (3.0% vs. 15.9%, p < 0.001).

On admission, the patient was hemodynamically stable but in a poor general condition. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the right upper quadrant without guarding. Laboratory tests showed significantly elevated inflammatory markers and electrolyte disturbances. Abdominal CT demonstrated a distended gallbladder located in the mid-abdomen with a thickened wall and mild ascites. No radiopaque gallstones were detected. Empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was initiated. Due to persistent symptoms and worsening inflammatory parameters, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed after discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy. Intraoperatively, a 180° torsion of the gallbladder around the infundibulum was identified. Due to a lack of adequate visualization, conversion to an open cholecystectomy was performed. Histopathological examination confirmed transmural ischemia, hemorrhage, and purulent inflammation without malignancy. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged in good general condition on the 11th postoperative day. GV should be considered in elderly patients presenting with atypical acute cholecystitis symptoms.

    "abstract": "Strictures, commonly referred to as stenoses, are a rare but significant complication for patients who have undergone colorectal surgery. Strictures are difficult to diagnose due to variable clinical presentations, diverse etiologies, and lack of formalized diagnostic criteria. The clinical impact of strictures can be quite variable, ranging from a benign course not requiring intervention to emergent complications (e.g., bowel obstruction, perforation). Importantly, strictures can also have a large impact on patient quality of life and long-term bowel function. Once a stricture is diagnosed or clinically suspected, it is critical to determine its etiology to help guide clinical management and prevent recurrence. Strictures can be categorized as partial or complete, intrinsic or extrinsic, benign or malignant. We propose the ARCTIC mnemonic (Anastomosis, Radiation/Chemotherapy, Technical, Inflammation, and Compression) as a useful tool for remembering common stricture causes in the postoperative environment. This review seeks to provide an overview of the etiologies, diagnosis, and management of strictures in the postoperative setting."

    "abstract": "Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is a frequently silent congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract. While complications such as bleeding and obstruction are more common, traumatic perforation remains extremely rare, particularly from penetrating injuries. To date, isolated perforation of MD following self-inflicted abdominal stab wounds has been reported only sporadically. We present the case of a 39-year-old male with a long-standing history of schizophrenia and epilepsy who arrived at the emergency department following his fifth self-inflicted abdominal stab injury over the past decade. On physical examination, a segment of small bowel was found protruding from a 4 cm periumbilical wound. Emergency exploratory laparotomy revealed extensive intra-abdominal adhesions and an isolated perforation of a Meckel's diverticulum located 60 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. No other visceral injuries or hemorrhage were detected. The diverticulum was resected using a linear stapler, and serosal defects were repaired. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day five. Isolated MD perforation caused by penetrating abdominal trauma is exceedingly rare and diagnostically challenging. When occurring in psychiatric patients with repetitive self-harm behavior, it presents an even more complex scenario. This case underscores the importance of meticulous intra-abdominal exploration in stab wound patients and contributes novel insight to the limited literature on traumatic MD injuries. Meckel divertikülü (MD), gastrointestinal sistemin en yaygın konjenital anomalilerinden biridir, ancak komplikasyonlarla birlikte görülme sıklığı düşüktür.

Fizik muayene, hassasiyet ve defans ile uyumlu klinik bulgular gösterdi. Bilgisayarlı tomografi, net bir perforasyon bulgusu içermemekle birlikte bağırsak anslarında segmenter distansiyon ve sıvı izlenimi nedeniyle hasta acil laparotomiye alındı. Operasyon sırasında, ileoçekal valvden yaklaşık 60 cm proksimalde yer alan Meckel divertikülünde tek başına perforasyon saptandı. Diğer intestinal yapılar sağlamdı. Perfore MD segmenti rezeksiyonla çıkarıldı ve histopatolojik inceleme, heterotopik mukoza veya neoplazi içermeyen perfore divertikül tanısını doğruladı. Hastanın postoperatif dönemi sorunsuz geçti ve stabil klinik durumda taburcu edildi. Olgu, hem travmatik MD perforasyonlarının tanısal güçlüklerini hem de psikiyatrik hastalarda abdominal travmaların yönetiminde dikkat edilmesi gereken ayırıcı tanıları vurgulamaktadır. Literatürde çok az sayıda benzer vaka bildirilmiş olup, bu olgu serisi travma cerrahlarının klinik farkındalığını artırmak amacıyla literatür bilgileri ile karşılaştırmalı olarak sunulmuştur."

    "abstract": "The escalating global threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and chronic biofilm-associated infections underscores the urgent need for novel therapeutic agents. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) offer a promising alternative due to their potent activity, broad-spectrum efficacy, and low resistance induction. In this study, we identified three novel cathelicidin-like peptides-Cr-CATH-1 (Cr1), Cr-CATH-2 (Cr2), and Cr-CATH-3 (Cr3)-from Chroicocephalus ridibundus. These peptides were systematically evaluated for their physicochemical properties, antimicrobial activity, bactericidal kinetics, and effects on biofilm formation and persister cells. Cr1 exhibited the most potent and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, particularly against Gram-negative and aquatic pathogens. Although Cr2 and Cr3 displayed relatively weaker antimicrobial effects, both peptides were effective in biofilm eradication and persister cell killing. Cr1 also demonstrated strong bactericidal activity, low cytotoxicity, and minimal hemolysis, suggesting a favorable safety profile. Its stability under physiological salt conditions, along with its ability to disrupt bacterial membranes, bind to DNA, and induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, highlights its therapeutic potential. In vivo, Cr1 significantly reduced bacterial load and improved survival in a murine peritonitis model, further supporting its potential for clinical and aquaculture applications. Our results suggest that Cr1 is a promising candidate for further development, while Cr2 and Cr3 may provide valuable insights for targeted therapeutic strategies, warranting additional investigation."

    "abstract": "Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital small-bowel anomaly and is usually asymptomatic. However, torsion of Meckel's diverticulum is an extremely rare complication that can mimic other acute abdominal conditions such as appendicitis or small-bowel obstruction, posing a clinical challenge to surgeons that may result in misdiagnosis, especially in the absence of advanced imaging. A 16-year-old Syrian male patient presented to the emergency department with 24-hour duration of severe right lower quadrant pain, vomiting, nausea, and 2-day history of obstipation. Physical examination showed abdominal distention and tenderness in McBurney's point, while plain abdominal X-ray showed air-fluid levels consist with small bowel obstruction. Computed tomography was not conducted since the device was out of service. Initial diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made on the basis of the clinical findings, and the patient underwent surgery, revealing a normal appendix, prompting exploratory laparotomy where a giant torsed Meckel's diverticulum with necrosis was demonstrated 45 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve, measuring 7 × 4 × 3 cm. The torsed diverticulum was excised through enterectomy and an end-to-end anastomosis was performed without complications. Postoperative intravenous antibiotics were given (please refer to Graphical Abstract). This case demonstrates that torsion of Meckel's diverticulum can mimic appendicitis and present with small-bowel obstruction and may only be identified during surgery, particularly when advanced imaging is inaccessible. Clinicians should remain vigilant regarding Meckel's diverticulum and its differential diagnoses in young patients with right lower‑quadrant pain and perform diagnostic exploration if deemed necessary."

    "abstract": "The vermiform appendix is a vestigial organ in humans. The congenital absence of the appendix was first described by Morgagni in 1719. Since then, more than a hundred such cases have been reported. The estimated incidence of this condition, based on autopsy studies and laparotomies, is 1 in 100,000, which is exceptionally rare. Nevertheless, given that acute appendicitis is one of the most common causes of abdominal pain, and is the most common indication for emergency abdominal surgery, the practising surgeon needs to be aware of this clinical entity as it can potentially lead to diagnostic confusion and even iatrogenic injuries. Hereby, we report the case of an 18-year-old girl, who presented with symptoms suggestive of acute appendicitis and was found to have congenital absence of the appendix intra-operatively."

    "abstract": "Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) is a rare condition characterized by gas-filled cysts within the wall of the gastrointestinal tract with variable presentation. We present two patients with pneumatosis intestinalis different in their clinical presentation, clinical course, and treatment. A 79-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presented with an acute abdomen. Clinical findings and abdominal radiography suggested perforation of the digestive tract. During emergency laparotomy, multiple cystic bubbles and perforation were found in the terminal ileum, and the affected part of the ileum was resected. The second patient was a 64-year-old female under adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and paclitaxel for ovarian adenocarcinoma. She presented with signs of bowel obstruction. Abdominal computed tomography was diagnostic for intestinal pneumatosis. She was successfully treated conservatively. These two cases highlight the varied clinical presentation of pneumatosis intestinalis and differences in its treatment. High clinical suspicion, cautious judgment of clinical and laboratory findings, and careful assessment of the imaging findings are necessary for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management."

    "abstract": "Single-port laparoscopic surgery (SPLS) is a promising alternative to multi-port laparoscopic surgery (MPLS) for emergency appendectomy, with potential advantages in cosmesis and recovery. However, its role remains uncertain, particularly in complex cases. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates SPLS's safety, effectiveness, and recent advancements to inform clinical decisions and practice. A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library identified studies comparing SPLS with MPLS in emergency appendectomy. Outcomes included conversion to open surgery, operative time, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, pain outcomes, and cosmetic satisfaction. Data synthesis followed PRISMA guidelines using a random-effects model. Eleven studies, including randomized controlled trials and cohort studies, were included. No significant differences were observed in conversion rates (OR 1.78, 95% CI: 0.63-5.03), complication rates (OR 0.96, 95% CI: 0.63-1.46), operative time (mean difference 2.93 min, 95% CI: - 3.17 to 9.02), length of stay (mean difference - 0.23 days, 95% CI: - 0.62 to 0.15), or postoperative pain (mean difference - 0.24, 95% CI: - 0.96 to 0.49). Substantial heterogeneity was present for operative time (I2 = 91%), length of stay (I2 = 92%), and pain (I2 = 80%). Cosmetic satisfaction generally favoured SPLS, although assessment methods varied considerably. While SPLS appears to be a safe and feasible alternative to MPLS for emergency appendectomy, current evidence does not support definitive equivalence across all outcomes due to significant heterogeneity, small study sizes, and inconsistent measurement tools. Future large-scale randomized trials are necessary to clarify SPLS's role, especially in complex cases and high-risk populations."

    "abstract": "Suturing techniques play a crucial role in wound healing and the overall outcome of surgical procedures. The debate between the effectiveness of interrupted versus continuous suturing techniques remains unresolved. This study aims to compare the outcomes of these two suturing methods in terms of Burst Abdomen in patients undergoing emergency exploratory laparotomy, with a focus on personalized surgical strategies. This randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Department of General Surgery BPS GMC Khanpur. Ninety patients requiring emergency midline laparotomy were randomized into two groups: Group A (Interrupted Closure) and Group B (Continuous Closure). The rectus sheath was closed using No. 1 Prolene suture, either interrupted or continuous. The primary outcome was the incidence of wound dehiscence, with secondary outcomes including closure time and patient demographics. The overall incidence of burst abdomen was higher in the continuous group (14.4%) compared to the interrupted group (6.7%), though this was not statistically significant (p = 0.071). The time taken for rectus closure was significantly longer in the interrupted group (mean 28.36 min) compared to the continuous group (mean 17.31 min, p < 0.0001). Subgroup analysis revealed a significantly lower incidence of burst abdomen in patients with tubercular perforation peritonitis in the interrupted group (7.7%) compared to the continuous group (57.1%, p = 0.01). The Study showed that interrupted closure technique showed a lower incidence of burst abdomen and preferred in tubercular perforation peritonitis although it requires more time for closure."

    "abstract": "Intestinal segments are commonly used in reconstructive urology to create continent or incontinent urinary channels. Initially, the viability of these segments depends on the integrity of the vascular pedicle. We report three patients with catheterizable, or incontinent channels constructed using the spiral Monti technique or incontinent ileovesicostomy all of whom developed postoperative complications involving the vascular pedicle. Patients with documented vascular pedicle injury to a continent or incontinent ileovesicostomy in New Children's Hospital, Helsinki University Hospital and in Riley Children's Hospital, Indiana School of Medicine were retrospectively identified and reviewed. In all three cases, the vascular pedicle was transected either electively or during emergency surgery for intestinal volvulus or obstruction, 17 months to 5 years after reconstructive surgery. Despite pedicle loss, all patients retained viable functional channels, supported by collateral blood supply. Follow-up ranging from several months to 19 years confirmed sustained channel viability. These cases suggest that, in select situations, collateral vascularization may be sufficient to preserve the function of a continent stoma despite loss of its primary vascular pedicle."

    "abstract": "There has been a marked increase over the last two decades in pediatric cases involving ingestion of multiple magnets, which can cause serious, potentially life-threatening gastrointestinal complications. More than half of such incidents require surgery, and nearly three-quarters are managed via laparotomy. Magnet extraction through laparoscopic appendectomy has been described as a viable, minimally invasive method in selected cases. We report the case of a seven-year-old boy with a staggered ingestion of two magnetic spheres. The initial abdominal radiograph showed the magnets in separate locations. An urgent endoscopic retrieval attempt was unsuccessful, and subsequent radiographs demonstrated that the magnets adhered to each other in a fixed position. Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed the magnets causing an adhesion between the caecal wall and the ileum with signs of imminent perforation. The magnet located in the cecum was removed via appendectomy. Inspection of the small bowel loops revealed a Meckel's diverticulum. The second magnet was guided into the diverticulum, secured with an endoclip, and the diverticulum containing the magnet was then exteriorized through the umbilicus and resected. This report highlights the effectiveness of appendectomy in the removal of ingested magnets. It also underscores the importance of thoroughly inspecting the small bowel during laparoscopy, as unexpected anatomical findings (such as a Meckel's diverticulum) may influence the surgical strategy."

A 18-year-old primigravida patient presented to our department with severe abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding following a clandestine abortion attempt, 15 days prior. Furthermore, the patient exhibited symptoms of uncontrollable vomiting and diarrhea that began 4 days prior to admission. Upon further examination, she was diagnosed with peritonitis. We performed an emergency laparotomy. It was discovered that the uterus was necrotic and that the foetus was in the abdominal cavity with its placenta. A hysterectomy was necessary to save the patient's life, resulting in permanent infertility. The patient's postoperative course was uncomplicated, and she was discharged from hospital on the 12th day after surgery. This case highlights the need for political and medico-social actions facilitating access to sexual and reproductive education and to voluntary termination of pregnancy in a legal and medicalized context in our regions."

    "abstract": "Routine preoperative group-and-save (G+S) testing remains common before laparoscopic appendectomy in UK hospitals, despite limited evidence of its necessity. This study evaluated the clinical need and cost-effectiveness of routine G+S sampling in patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy at a single centre over 10 years. We conducted a retrospective cohort study at Homerton University Hospital, London, UK, including all patients who underwent emergency or elective laparoscopic appendectomy between October 2014 and October 2024. Electronic records were used to identify patients and any perioperative transfusions. For transfused patients, operative and medical records were reviewed to determine the indication and timing of transfusion (surgical bleeding vs. other causes, intraoperative vs. postoperative). Demographic and clinical data were extracted by two independent reviewers and anonymized. We compared our transfusion rate to those reported in six published studies using two-proportion z-tests (significance p<0.05). A cost analysis estimated the financial impact of routine G+S, using the National Health Service (NHS) cost of £15-£21 per test. Among 1,733 patients (mean age 51 years; 925 males, 808 females), five (0.29%) received blood transfusions. None occurred intraoperatively. Only two patients (0.12%) required red cell transfusions due to postoperative surgical bleeding (one following perforated appendicitis and one unexplained hemorrhage). The other three transfusions were for non-surgical causes: one patient with sickle cell disease (red cells), one with postoperative anemia (fresh frozen plasma), and one with sepsis-related coagulopathy (platelets). Our overall red cell transfusion rate (0.17%) did not differ significantly from published rates (range 0-0.46%; all p>0.05). There were no deaths. Routine G+S testing for all 1,733 patients would have cost approximately £26,000-£36,500 over the 10 years (≈£15-£21 per test); with only two clinically relevant surgical transfusions, the cost per such case would exceed £13,000. Routine preoperative G+S testing before laparoscopic appendectomy provides minimal clinical benefit in low-risk patients and represents unnecessary resource use. Our 10-year data show an extremely low transfusion rate, with most transfusions driven by patients' underlying conditions rather than operative bleeding. These findings support a selective, risk-based approach to G+S: reserve testing for patients with significant comorbidities or anticipated complex surgery while omitting routine G+S in low-risk cases. Such a strategy would maintain patient safety but reduce laboratory workload and costs."

    "abstract": "Peritoneal dialysis (PD) offers greater flexibility than hemodialysis, especially in patients with limited mobility or demanding schedules; however, PD-related infection is a major complication and a cause of withdrawal from peritoneal dialysis. The Antibiotic effect of Silver continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) Catheter on Peritoneal Dialysis-related infections (ASCA-PD) study will evaluate the effectiveness of a novel silver CAPD catheter, incorporating silver-based antimicrobial technology, for preventing these infections and improving PD adherence. This randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of a silver CAPD catheter compared with those of a conventional catheter at 14 Japanese facilities. A total of 250 adult patients with newly initiated PD will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to receive either catheter type. The key exclusion criteria are prior PD, emergency PD initiation, non-abdominal exit-site placement, metal allergy, life expectancy <1 year, severe liver disease, certain dermatologic conditions, and immunosuppression. After providing informed consent, patients will undergo nasal swab screening for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Randomization will be stratified by facility and diabetes status. The primary outcome is the composite endpoint of all exit-site and tunnel infections within 12 months of PD initiation. Secondary outcomes include individual infection events, catheter removal, peritonitis, catheter patency, allergic reactions, technique failure (transition to hemodialysis for ≥30 days or death), and transition to hybrid dialysis. A Poisson regression model will be used to analyze the primary outcome, adjusting for observation time, treatment group, and stratification factors. Time-to-event secondary outcomes will be analyzed by competing risk regression. Subgroup analyses will be carried out to explore the impacts of age, sex, diabetes, insertion method, and body mass index. Unlike previous designs, our silver CAPD catheter incorporates AgNPs into silicone, enabling sustained antimicrobial effects both externally and internally, potentially overcoming limitations seen in prior human studies. This study will demonstrate the efficacy of silver CAPD catheters for preventing PD-related infections, especially during the initiation phase of PD, with the aim of providing a new therapeutic option.

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common surgical emergency. The role of laparoscopy in managing its strangulated form is usually not preferred by many surgeons due to technical challenges and concerns about safety. This study aimed to analyze the outcomes of a \"laparoscopic-first\" policy for patients with suspected strangulated SBO at a single institution. We conducted a retrospective review of all patients who underwent a laparoscopic-first approach for suspected strangulated SBO between January 2013 and December 2024. We analyzed the conversion rate to open surgery, intraoperative findings, and postoperative outcomes for patients in whom the laparoscopic procedure was successfully completed. A total of 24 patients underwent a laparoscopic-first approach. Of these, six patients (25.0%) required conversion to open laparotomy, primarily due to difficulty in safely releasing the strangulation or poor visibility. The remaining 18 patients were successfully managed laparoscopically. Within this cohort (median age: 80.0 years), the cause of obstruction was an adhesive band in all cases (100%). Bowel resection, performed extracorporeally via the single-port site in most cases, was required in 16 patients (88.9%). The median operative time was 89 minutes. Postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ II) occurred in two patients (11.1%). There was no 30-day mortality. The median postoperative hospital stay was 9.5 days. A laparoscopic-first approach for selected patients with strangulated SBO is a feasible and safe strategy when performed with a low threshold for conversion. Favorable short-term outcomes with low morbidity can be achieved, even in an elderly cohort requiring a high rate of bowel resection. Prudent patient selection and experienced surgical judgment are paramount to the success of this approach."

Fungal involvement, particularly by Candida albicans, is exceedingly rare but associated with poorer outcomes than bacterial peritonitis. We report a case of a 52-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus who presented with acute abdominal pain and hemodynamic instability. Emergency laparotomy revealed a 5 mm perforation on the anterior gastric wall, which was repaired primarily. Postoperatively, the patient developed persistent sepsis, acute kidney injury, and hypoalbuminemia. Two weeks later, imaging showed focal dehiscence at the repair site. Intra-abdominal cultures grew Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while blood cultures confirmed candidemia. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining demonstrated fungus-hyphae consistent with invasive gastric candidiasis. Despite antifungal therapy, the patient's condition deteriorated, necessitating re-exploration, where a friable gastric wall precluded re-repair. Candida albicans-associated gastric perforation is exceptionally uncommon, with less than 15 cases reported in the literature. Diabetes, malnutrition, and prolonged antibiotic exposure are key risk factors. Early recognition of fungal involvement, timely antifungal therapy, and tailored surgical management are critical to improving outcomes. This case highlights the importance of considering fungal etiologies in refractory intra-abdominal sepsis."

    "abstract": "ST segment elevation patterns on Electrocardiogram (ECG) are a crucial finding in the diagnosis and treatment of acute coronary syndrome. An ST segment elevation pattern can be a sign of acute myocardial ischemia requiring immediate intervention. However, ST elevation patterns have been reported to occur due to obstructive intraabdominal pathology, a diagnosis often confirmed by cardiac catheterization. Here we report a 75-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with worsening chest and epigastric abdominal pain. ECG demonstrated ST-segment elevations in inferior leads (II, III, and aVF) with reciprocal changes in the lateral leads (I and aVL). Physical exam was suggestive of a bowel obstruction at the site of a large incarcerated ventral hernia, which was later confirmed by imaging. Due to the lack of typical chest pain symptoms and a strong suspicion of obstructive intraabdominal pathology, activation of the catheterization laboratory was deferred. Decompression of the bowel obstruction was achieved with a nasogastric tube, which resulted in immediate resolution of ST-segment elevations. During her admission, her ventral hernia was repaired, and left heart catheterization was deferred per cardiology recommendations. While an ST-segment elevation due to occlusive myocardial infarction is a diagnosis that cannot be missed and requires an emergent workup, it is important to be aware that it is possible for a small bowel obstruction (SBO) to present with ECG changes consistent with an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). We also found that ST-segment elevations due to obstructive intraabdominal pathology are more reportedly seen in the literature in the inferior leads than any other contiguous leads, which is a novel pattern not discussed in past literature."

Clinical examination revealed tachycardia, abdominal distension, and generalized tenderness. Imaging confirmed small bowel obstruction without an identifiable cause. Emergency laparoscopy revealed a 5-cm defect in the left broad ligament, through which viable bowel had herniated, resulting in a closed-loop obstruction. The herniated bowel was reduced, and the defect was closed with continuous sutures. The patient's recovery was uneventful. This case underscores the diagnostic challenges of broad ligament hernias and highlights the utility of laparoscopy as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND In pediatric emergency departments, increasing patient volume has led to a rising number of consultations, contributing to physician workload, longer hospital stays, and systemic inefficiencies - especially in specialties like pediatric surgery, which faces global shortages in trained professionals. This study aimed to determine the true consultation indication rate between pediatric emergency departments (PED) and pediatric surgery (PS). The study also sought to quantify the consultation-related workload imposed on the PS department by the PED. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective study included 1639 pediatric patients who were referred for PS consultation from the PED of 2 tertiary university hospitals in 2023. The data included patient demographics, consultation timing, preliminary diagnoses, responses, and outcomes. Consultations were categorized based on the justification and time of request. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS v25.0, with the significance set at P<0.05. RESULTS We enrolled a total of 1639 (3.1%) out of 52 660 PED patients treated in the 2 centers. Of these, 803 (49%) were deemed appropriate by the PS department, while 836 (51%) were recommended for pediatric evaluation. Surgical intervention was performed in 312 patients (19%) and 326 patients (19.8%) were hospitalized without surgery. Nighttime consultations were significantly more likely to be considered inappropriate (P<.00001), and the most common consultation reasons were abdominal pain/suspected appendicitis (43.3%), foreign body ingestion (9.6%), and trauma (7.1%). CONCLUSIONS This study shows the high rate of inappropriate pediatric surgery consultations, especially during nighttime hours, underscoring the need for improved triage and training. Addressing these issues is essential to enhance clinical efficiency and reduce unnecessary workloads amid the global shortage of pediatric surgeons."

    "abstract": "Uterine perforation complicated by incarcerated fallopian tube and cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP) constitutes an exceptionally rare and clinically challenging condition. The diagnostic dilemma arises from elevated β-hCG levels combined with parauterine mass formation, which frequently mimics tubal ectopic pregnancy presentation. This case report aims to highlight the critical importance of differential diagnosis in preventing clinical mismanagement of this complex obstetric emergency. A 35-year-old woman (gravida 3, para 2) with recent Dilation and Curettage (D&C) presented with abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and elevated β-hCG, initially misdiagnosed as tubal ectopic pregnancy. Initial transvaginal ultrasound detected a right adnexal mass with intrauterine fluid. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated communication between the mass and uterine myometrium. Repeat transvaginal ultrasound confirmed CSP, surgically validated. Combined laparoscopic-hysteroscopic surgery performed uterine perforation repair, CSP resection, and right fallopian tube repositioning. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 7 without complications. Heuristic-driven cognitive bias significantly contributes to diagnostic error. For multiparous women following abortion, heightened vigilance is essential to guard against the occurrence of this rare condition."

Administration of analgesia, including opioids, has not been shown to delay the diagnosis of appendicitis, yet oligoanalgesia remains a common occurrence. We aimed to determine the proportion of any analgesia and opioid analgesia administration, the median time to first analgesia administration, and to identify factors associated with the administration of any analgesia and opioid analgesia in patients with suspected appendicitis. We conducted a single-center cross-sectional study of children less than 18 years of age evaluated in the pediatric ED from June 2014 to June 2021 for suspected appendicitis. Deidentified data were extracted from the electronic record through a data repository. Our primary outcomes were the administration of analgesia and the median time to first analgesia administration. We used descriptive statistics and multivariate regression analysis to compare independent influences on analgesia administration. During the 8-year study period, 7065 children were evaluated for appendicitis. Overall, 4821 (68.2%) received some form of analgesia, 3157 (44.7%) received nonopioid analgesia only, and 1664 (23.6%) received opioid analgesia during their ED visit. Overall median time to first analgesia was 104 minutes. Median time to first nonopioid analgesia and first opioid analgesia was 94.5 minutes and 136 minutes, respectively. Moderate and severe pain scores, fever, tachycardia, and higher ESI level of acuity were significantly associated with analgesia administration. Analgesia administration in children with suspected appendicitis varies considerably. Efforts to target more consistent and timely pediatric pain management practices are needed."

Four days later, the patient developed abdominal pain. Computed tomography scan revealed signs of perforation, and diagnostic laparoscopy confirmed a sigmoid perforation with a localized abscess. A sigmoidectomy with end-to-end circular stapled anastomosis was performed, during which the dentures were mobilized retrogradely to enable controlled extraction, leading to a full and rapid recovery. This case highlights the potential complications and occasional need for surgery due to ingested foreign bodies and the importance of accurate diagnosis and vigilant monitoring in managing these patients."

    "title": "Time of Day Impacts Surgical Site Infection in Emergency Gastrointestinal Surgery in Kenya.",
    "abstract": "Surgical site infections (SSIs) are a leading cause of postoperative morbidity, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The influence of operative timing on SSI risk remains unclear in these settings. This study aimed to assess the association between case timing and SSIs following emergency gastrointestinal surgery at a tertiary hospital in Kenya. We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult patients undergoing emergency gastrointestinal operations between January 2016 and December 2019. Procedures were categorized by timing: weekday daytime (08:00-16:59) versus off-peak (weeknights, weekends, and holidays). The primary outcome was SSI. Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for wound classification, procedure type, and the Africa Surgical Outcomes Study (ASOS) risk score. Sensitivity analyses evaluated duration of illness, prior care, operative duration, presence of perforation, year of admission, admission to the intensive care unit, and number of surgeons. Of 400 patients included, 58 (14.5%) developed an SSI. SSI occurred in 19.9% of weekday cases versus 11.7% of off-peak cases (p = 0.029). In adjusted analysis, weekday operations were associated with increased odds of SSI (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.6, and p = 0.024). Dirty wound classification and small intestine and colorectal cases were also associated with increased SSI rates in the model. The observed SSI rate was significantly lower than the 28.6% rate predicted by GlobalSurg data for middle-HDI countries (p < 0.001). Contrary to findings from high-income settings, emergency operations performed during off-peak hours were associated with fewer SSIs than weekday cases. This may reflect workflow differences or lower operating room traffic. The findings support ongoing efforts to optimize perioperative systems and challenge assumptions about off-hour surgical care in LMICs."

    "abstract": "We investigated changes in platelet count after surgery for strangulated bowel obstruction (SBO), evaluated associations between postoperative thrombocytopenia and short-term outcomes, and identified risk factors for postoperative thrombocytopenia. This study included 109 patients who underwent emergency surgery for SBO between January 2014 and December 2023. Postoperative short-term outcomes were compared among three groups according to the lowest postoperative platelet count. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors associated with severe thrombocytopenia. All patients had platelet counts below the preoperative level within 72 h post-surgery. The severe thrombocytopenia (postoperative platelet count < 10 × 104/µL) group exhibited significantly increased postoperative complications, 28-day mortality, and length of hospital stay. Preoperative thrombocytopenia, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and bowel resection were independent risk factors for severe thrombocytopenia. Postoperative platelet counts fell below preoperative levels in all patients with SBO. Severe thrombocytopenia was associated with poor postoperative outcomes."

    "abstract": "Vancomycin-resistant enterococci are multidrug-resistant bacteria that as of 2021 continue to pervade the U.S. healthcare system as the second-most prevalent source of healthcare-acquired infections behind Escherichia coli. Given the limited treatment options for vancomycin-resistant enterococci and growing concerns about antibiotic-induced gut microbiome dysbiosis, there is an urgent need for narrow-spectrum antibiotics that can selectively target vancomycin-resistant enterococci while preserving the integrity of the gut microbiome. Previous studies have demonstrated the in vivo potential of orally dosed acetazolamide-based compounds to reduce vancomycin-resistant enterococci bioburden in the gastrointestinal tract and internal organs of mice. However, while it is hypothesized that these molecules inhibit bacterial carbonic anhydrases, the exact target of the acetazolamide scaffold in vancomycin-resistant enterococci has remained unconfirmed. Additionally, the impact of the scaffold on in vivo gut microbiome diversity remains uncharacterized. The work herein reports the chemoproteomic identification of α-carbonic anhydrase as the primary target of the acetazolamide scaffold in E. faecium and presents its uniqueness as a narrow-spectrum antibiotic target that can be exploited by CAI0019, a lead acetazolamide derivative with in vivo efficacy, while sparing gut microbiome diversity in mice. This work presents compelling data that not only confirm α-carbonic anhydrase as an antibiotic target in Enterococcus but also demonstrate that narrow-spectrum in vivo antienterococcal efficacy can be achieved through targeting α-carbonic anhydrase such that gut commensal microbiota remain unimpacted."

    "abstract": "The widespread use of small and powerful neodymium magnets in consumer products has led to a significant rise in paediatric magnet ingestion. The ingestion of multiple magnets poses serious risks, including bowel obstruction and perforation. Evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) are necessary to inform clinicians of the safest and most effective management strategies across a range of healthcare settings. This systematic review aims to summarise existing CPGs for diagnosing and managing paediatric magnet ingestion, evaluate the supporting evidence, highlight variation and consensus, and identify areas requiring further research. MEDLINE, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Embase were searched to identify CPGs. Study characteristics, investigation and management recommendations, and indications for conservative management, endoscopy, surgery and discharge with and without follow-up were extracted. Two reviewers independently assessed CPG quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument. 25 CPGs were included. Recommendations varied for diagnostic imaging, management of single and multiple magnet ingestion and the use of conservative, endoscopic or surgical interventions. However, there was consensus that: abdominal X-ray is the preferred first-line imaging modality, conservative management is recommended for asymptomatic single magnets, endoscopic removal is recommended for prepyloric asymptomatic multiple magnets and surgery for symptomatic multiple magnets. AGREE II appraisal revealed poor scores in CPG Applicability, Stakeholder Involvement and Rigour of Development, but strong scores for Editorial Independence. Existing CPGs for paediatric magnet ingestion are based on low-quality evidence or expert consensus. This review highlights inconsistencies and areas of consensus in current CPGs for paediatric magnet ingestion. Variations underscore the need for standardised, evidence-based guidelines to optimise care for affected children. Future research should focus on addressing gaps in evidence and consensus to ensure consistent management across healthcare settings."

    "abstract": "Acute arterial occlusive mesenteric ischemia (AAOMI) is a life-threatening emergency associated with high mortality rates. Revascularization is a key component of multimodal therapy; however, the optimal initial treatment strategy, open surgical (OR) versus endovascular revascularization (ER), remains a subject of ongoing debate. This study aimed to compare outcomes between open and endovascular revascularization in patients with AAOMI. This retrospective single-center cohort study included all patients with AAOMI who underwent urgent revascularization between January 2004 and July 2024. Based on the initial revascularization method, patients were divided into two treatment groups: open surgical and endovascular. Outcomes included in-hospital mortality, bowel resection rate and extent, incidence of short bowel syndrome, and length of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Of the 100 patients included, 79 were initially treated with open revascularization and 21 with endovascular revascularization. In-hospital mortality was 48.1% (38/79) of OR patients and 33.3% (7/21) of ER patients (p = 0.227). 42 patients (53.2%) with open surgical treatment required bowel resection, compared to 10 patients (47.6%) with endovascular-first revascularization (p = 0.651). The median extent of bowel resection was 69 cm in the OR group and 71 cm in the ER group (p = 0.350). No differences could be detected regarding short bowel syndrome. Median hospital stay was 15 days in the open surgical cohort vs. 11 days in the endovascular cohort (p = 0.484). Median ICU stay was 5 days in the OR group and 4 days in the ER group (p = 0.172). Open surgical and endovascular revascularization resulted in comparable outcomes regarding in-hospital mortality, bowel resection, short bowel syndrome, and length of hospital and ICU stay in this retrospective cohort. Treatment decisions should be individualized based on occlusion type, patient condition, and institutional expertise. Prospective multicenter studies are warranted to further refine optimal management strategies for AAOMI."

    "abstract": "Acute gastric volvulus is a rare condition in children, and delayed diagnosis may lead to gastric ischemia, perforation, or even death. It is sometimes associated with a wandering spleen, a condition in which the spleen migrates from its normal anatomical position due to the absence of fixation ligaments. We report the first known case of a patient with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) presenting with simultaneous acute gastric volvulus and a wandering spleen. A 6-year-old male with PTHS was urgently referred for acute abdominal pain and a 24 h history of non-bilious and non-bloody emesis. The x-ray showed a massive gastric dilatation, and an upper gastrointestinal series (UGI) revealed a gastric outlet obstruction. An emergency laparoscopy revealed a gastric mesoaxial volvulus with a hypotonic wall with no sign of ischemia or perforation associated with a wandering spleen. Gastropexy was performed by anchoring the gastric greater curvature to the anterior abdominal wall, covering the spleen in a good position in the left upper abdomen, completely covered by the gastric fundus. The patient made an uneventful recovery and was completely asymptomatic. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of simultaneous gastric volvulus and wandering spleen in a patient with PTHS. Laparoscopic gastropexy is a straightforward and effective procedure that combines the advantages of previously described surgical techniques."

    "abstract": "Acute pesticide poisoning is a significant public health issue, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where pesticides are commonly used in agriculture. While the neurological and cardiovascular effects of pesticide poisoning have been extensively studied, gastrointestinal injuries remain underexplored despite their severe complications, including bleeding, perforation, and obstruction. This mini-review examines the prevalence, mechanisms, and treatment of gastrointestinal injuries caused by acute pesticide poisoning from 2014 to 2024. Based on an analysis of 11 studies encompassing 38 cases across China, India, and Japan, we identified organophosphate compounds as the most common culprits of gastrointestinal damage. Mechanisms of injury involve multifactorial mechanisms, including the direct toxicity of pesticides, adverse therapeutic interventions such as atropine and gastric lavage, and systemic effects like endothelial dysfunction and hypoxia. Preventive strategies are discussed, including the use of proton pump inhibitors, careful atropine dosing, and balloon jejunal catheter placement to minimize complications. This review underscores the urgent need for further research to develop targeted preventive and therapeutic measures for gastrointestinal injuries caused by pesticide poisoning, aiming to improve patient survival and quality of life."

    "abstract": "Complications occur in approximately 12% of cases of diverticulitis, with perforation occurring in up to 10% of complications. Typically, patient with perforated diverticulitis present intraperitoneally with abdominal pain and peritoneal signs. By contrast, pneumoretroperitoneum and pneumomediastinum are rare complications and lack typical symptoms, making their diagnosis difficult and often delayed, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. A 66-year-old man presented with lower abdominal pain for 3 days. On examination, his vital signs were stable, and the abdomen was soft with mild distension and left lower quadrant tenderness, but no peritoneal signs were noted. Laboratory tests indicated leukocytosis and a markedly elevated C-reactive protein level. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed focal wall thickening and fat stranding near the rectosigmoid junction as well as pneumoretroperitoneum, pneumomediastinum, and minor pneumoperitoneum. Suspecting hollow organ perforation, an emergent exploratory laparotomy was performed which revealed a retroperitoneal abscess with mesocolonic necrosis, likely due to perforated sigmoid diverticulitis. The patient underwent sigmoid resection with Hartmann's procedure and retroperitoneal drainage. Follow-up CT on postoperative day 14 confirmed resolution of the free air, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 40 with an uneventful recovery. Pneumoretroperitoneum and pneumomediastinum are rare complications of perforated diverticulitis, often with delayed diagnosis due to the absence of peritoneal signs. CT aids detection, and timely surgical intervention is crucial."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal perforation is a very common surgical emergency with significant mortality and morbidity, which needs urgent intervention. Foreign body-related perforations are very rare, accounting for less than 1% of cases. However, Colonic perforation by Eel fish is an extremely rare phenomenon; only three cases have been reported in the existing literature. Here, we report a rare case of traumatic colonic perforation with septic shock by a rectally inserted Eel fish. A 25-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a 4-day history of abdominal pain, accompanied by high-grade fever and a loss of consciousness lasting 1 day. Initial workups suggested the case might be a case of intestinal perforation with septic shock. However, in the abdominal X-ray, there was a bizarre radiopaque shadow in the right iliac fossa. Emergency exploratory laparotomy was done, and a large perforation was found at the rectosigmoid junction. Multiple pieces of fish bone were found in the peritoneal cavity. A putrefied Eel fish was found in the peritoneal cavity, approximately 25 cm in length. After thorough peritoneal toileting, a Hartmann-like procedure, where the distal end was closed and secured with a silk suture and the proximal exteriorized for fecal diversion, was done, and the patient was shifted to the intensive care unit. However, despite the best medical care, the patient expired on the third postoperative day. Live animals causing rectal perforation have rarely been documented in the literature. Unusual healthcare beliefs, inadvertent sexual conduct, or criminal aggressiveness may be involved. However, the cause may remain a mystery. Rapid diagnosis with proper history, aided by imaging, with urgent surgical intervention, may increase patient survival. Therefore, emergency care physicians should also be conscious of the rare and unusual causes of intestinal perforation to reach the diagnosis promptly."

We report the first pediatric case initially managed conservatively and later treated with interval LATUM (laparoscopic-assisted transumbilical Meckel's diverticulectomy) as definitive surgical therapy. A 9-year-old girl presented with 4 days of lower abdominal pain and non-bilious vomiting. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed free fluid in the right iliac fossa, and a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan showed a perforated MD with pelvic collection and free air. Conservative management with antibiotics and analgesics was instituted, leading to improvement. After 6 weeks, she underwent LATUM. Intraoperatively, a perforated MD with adhesions was identified and resected with ileal reconstruction. Histopathology confirmed ectopic gastric tissue in the diverticulum without malignancy. The patient recovered without complications and remained symptom-free at follow-up visits after 1 week, 6 months, and 2 years. While symptomatic MD often requires immediate surgery, selected cases with localized inflammation may benefit from initial conservative management. This approach can prevent emergency procedures and allow for safer, delayed, minimally invasive resection. LATUM, chosen in our case, offered a tactile advantage and a cost-effective, hand-sewn anastomosis. To date, only three adult cases of interval MD resection have been reported, with none in children. A complicated MD in a child with acute abdomen presents diagnostic and treatment challenges. Accurate imaging aids diagnosis, and careful case selection can prevent emergency surgery, enabling delayed, minimally invasive interventions like LATUM."

    "abstract": "An obturator hernia (OH) is an uncommon type of pelvic hernia that typically presents as a bowel obstruction. It occurs when a portion of the intestine, most commonly the ileum, herniates through the obturator foramen in the pelvic wall. A 76-year-old woman with a known history of Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presented with a 2-day history of acute abdominal pain, vomiting, and abdominal bloating. On physical examination, she exhibited diffuse abdominal tenderness and a painful right-sided mass. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed bowel distension with an ileal loop incarcerated through the right obturator foramen. After initial resuscitative measures, the patient underwent a midline laparotomy. Surgical exploration confirmed a strangulated ileal segment that remained viable. Both obturator foramina were repaired with sutures and reinforced using adjacent tissue structures. Due to its non-specific clinical presentation, the diagnosis of OH is frequently delayed or missed. A palpable mass is rarely observed, and one of the more distinctive signs, the Howship-Romberg sign, characterized by pain radiating to the inner thigh and knee, may be mistaken for other conditions such as gonarthrosis or lumbar disc disease. Prompt use of abdominal CT imaging has been shown to improve diagnostic accuracy and can significantly reduce both the morbidity and mortality linked to this type of hernia. OH should be considered in at-risk individuals due to its subtle presentation. Prompt identification using CT scans and timely surgical intervention are crucial for enhancing prognosis and minimizing potential complications."

    "abstract": "Neonatal intestinal perforation often necessitates urgent surgery, yet whether enterostomy is necessary or primary repair is preferable remains debated. We estimated the short-term effect of choosing enterostomy versus primary repair after adjustment for preoperative severity. We screened data from the National Clinical Database-Pediatric registry and enrolled neonates who underwent surgery for gastrointestinal perforation between 2017 and 2022. Patients were categorized into two initial operative strategies: enterostomy and non-enterostomy, defined as primary closure or resection with anastomosis without a stoma. Propensity score matching was performed to adjust for baseline characteristics. The primary outcomes were 30- and 90-day mortality and any unexpected complication within 30 days after the initial operation. Secondary outcomes included anastomotic leakage and unplanned reoperation within 30 days. Of the 1297 identified cases, 914 met the inclusion criteria (enterostomy: 773 versus non-enterostomy: 141). The 30-day mortality rate was significantly higher in the enterostomy group (6.7 %, p = 0.047), without differences in the 90-day mortality or overall complication rates. In the propensity score matched cohort (all absolute standardized mean differences <0.15), mortality and overall complications did not differ between groups, whereas 30-day anastomotic leakage was lower in the enterostomy group (odds ratio, 0.13; 95 % CI, 0.03-0.6; p = 0.009). After severity adjustment, short-term outcomes after the initial operation were broadly comparable between enterostomy and primary repair. These findings suggest enterostomy is not universally required and primary repair may be reasonable in carefully selected infants. Longitudinal data are needed to assess cumulative morbidity, including stoma closure, beyond this registry snapshot."

Mortality increases with complications of diaphragmatic hernia, which include strangulated bowel, perforation, and peritonitis. Traumatic diaphragmatic injury (TDI) is notoriously underdiagnosed and delayed presentations are common. Firearm injuries and stab wounds account for the majority of TDI. Blunt TDI is frequently associated with severe injuries including pneumothorax and hemorrhaging shock. Contrast enhanced computed tomography imaging is the gold standard for diagnosis in both blunt and penetrating mechanisms of injury. Laparoscopy is a useful nonoperative tool for diagnosing TDI. Small lacerations may not warrant further investigation or repair at the index admission. Patients with clinical instability and/or evidence of TDI with blunt trauma warrant emergent operative intervention. Recognition of TDI is essential for nurse practitioners and physician assistants, given disease mortality, frequency of delayed presentations, and the lack of guidance on surveillance for initially nonoperative injuries."

    "abstract": "Large abdominal incisions in patients with obesity carry high rates of systemic and wound complications. European Hernia Society guidelines recommend laparoscopic intraperitoneal on-lay mesh (IPOM) repair for large hernia defects and those at higher risk of wound morbidity, ideally with defect closure and 5 cm mesh overlap. We describe IPOM repair in a patient with BMI 62 and relate this to current evidence in obesity. A 69-year-old morbidly obese woman (BMI 62) with multiple comorbidities presented as an emergency with 5 days of vomiting and abdominal pain. CT confirmed small bowel obstruction due to a ventral abdominal wall hernia. Operative findings revealed an obstructed paraumbilical hernia containing small bowel and omentum. A laparoscopic \"hybrid\" IPOM + repair was performed with generous mesh overlap. Recovery was uneventful with no surgical complications. Minimally invasive approaches are preferred in obesity, with evidence suggesting lower perioperative complications and recurrence than open repair. Challenges include surgeon expertise, timing, ergonomics, distorted surface landmarks, need for higher pneumoperitoneum pressures, and their physiological effects. With careful planning, IPOM ventral hernia repair is a viable option for obese patients, even in emergencies. Defect closure is recommended whenever feasible. A hybrid approach-limited incision and sac excision after laparoscopic closure-may reduce postoperative seroma risk."

After peritoneal incision and dissection of the Retzius and Bogros spaces, the incarcerated bowel loop was reduced. A self-gripping polyester mesh was placed to cover the myopectineal orifice and obturator foramen, and the peritoneal flap was closed with an absorbable barbed suture. Intestinal perfusion was assessed intraoperatively using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence, which demonstrated a 3 cm infarcted segment requiring resection and hand-sewn, two-layer isoperistaltic anastomosis through a mini-umbilical incision. The postoperative course was uneventful with discharge on day five.

    "abstract": "Accurate assessment of symptom onset is crucial for diagnosing acute abdominal pain, particularly to identify life-threatening conditions such as rupture, dissection, vascular occlusion, torsion, or perforation. However, the optimal method for evaluating pain onset remains unclear. To compare the diagnostic performance of two history-taking approaches for evaluating pain onset: sudden onset characterization, which asks whether the pain began suddenly, and time-to-peak assessment, which asks how long it took for the pain to reach maximum intensity, considering \"instantaneous peak\" responses as positive. Prospective diagnostic study at a single acute care hospital in Japan between December 2022 and October 2024. A consecutive sample of adult patients presenting with abdominal pain of 7 days' duration or less in the emergency department was assessed. The primary outcome was the presence of a target condition, defined as rupture, dissection, vascular occlusion, torsion, or perforation of an intra-abdominal organ, confirmed by contrast-enhanced computed tomography findings or clinical follow-up. Diagnostic measures including specificity, sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values, and likelihood and diagnostic odds ratios were calculated for each approach. Of the 629 patients (median age, 58 years [interquartile range (IQR), 44-72 years]; 48.5% male), 20 (3.2%) were diagnosed with a target condition. Specificity improved from 86.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 83.8%-89.2%) with sudden onset characterization to 94.3% (95% CI, 92.1%-95.8%) with time-to-peak assessment (P < .001). Sensitivity was 40.0% (95% CI, 21.9%-61.3%) for sudden onset characterization and 30.0% (95% CI, 14.5%-51.9%) for time-to-peak assessment (P = .48). Time-to-peak assessment demonstrated higher specificity without a significant loss of sensitivity compared with sudden onset characterization. This approach may assist in ruling-in critical intra-abdominal conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain. However, neither method alone is sufficient to rule-out life-threatening conditions."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is a common surgical emergency characterized by inflammation of the appendix, often attributed to luminal obstruction or bacterial infection. However, rare etiologies, such as parasitic infections, can also lead to appendicitis. Among these, Entamoeba histolytica, a protozoan parasite causing amoebiasis, is an infrequent but noteworthy cause. Amoebic infection of the appendix occurs when trophozoites invade the mucosal layer of the appendix, leading to inflammation, tissue necrosis, and, in severe disease, perforation. Amoebic appendicitis is more common in regions where amoebiasis is endemic, such as tropical and subtropical areas, and is often associated with poor sanitation and contaminated water supplies. The clinical presentation of amoebic appendicitis often mimics acute bacterial appendicitis, including abdominal pain, fever, and leukocytosis, making it challenging to diagnose preoperatively. The condition may coexist with colonic amoebiasis or present independently. The severity of amoebic appendicitis may be much more than that of bacterial appendicitis, and it may require more intensive management, hence the importance of knowing the diagnosis. Histopathological examination and identification of E histolytica in the appendix are crucial for a definitive diagnosis. Prompt surgical intervention, along with anti-amoebic therapy, is essential for successful management. This case report highlights an uncommon etiology of appendicitis due to amoebic infection, emphasizing the need for clinicians to consider parasitic etiologies in regions where amoebiasis is prevalent."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis (AAp) remains one of the most common abdominal emergencies, requiring rapid and accurate diagnosis to prevent complications and unnecessary surgeries. Conventional diagnostic methods, including medical history, clinical assessment, biochemical markers, and imaging techniques, often present limitations in sensitivity and specificity, especially in atypical cases. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated remarkable potential in enhancing diagnostic accuracy through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. This review evaluates the current applications of AI in both adult and pediatric AAp, focusing on clinical data-based models, radiological imaging analysis, and AI-assisted clinical decision support systems. ML models such as random forest, support vector machines, logistic regression, and extreme gradient boosting have exhibited superior diagnostic performance compared to traditional scoring systems, achieving sensitivity and specificity rates exceeding 90% in multiple studies. Additionally, DL techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks, have been shown to outperform radiologists in interpreting ultrasound and computed tomography images, enhancing diagnostic confidence. This review synthesized findings from 65 studies, demonstrating that AI models integrating multimodal data including clinical, laboratory, and imaging parameters further improved diagnostic precision. Moreover, explainable AI approaches, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations, have facilitated model transparency, fostering clinician trust in AI-driven decision-making. This review highlights the advancements in AI for AAp diagnosis, emphasizing that AI is used not only to establish the diagnosis of AAp but also to differentiate complicated from uncomplicated cases. While preliminary results are promising, further prospective, multicenter studies are required for large-scale clinical implementation, given that a great proportion of current evidence derives from retrospective designs, and existing prospective cohorts exhibit limited sample sizes or protocol variability. Future research should also focus on integrating AI-driven decision support tools into routine emergency care workflows."

Effective and timely management is essential to prevent severe morbidity and mortality. Postpartum haemorrhage is classified as primary or secondary. Management options include medical, mechanical, and surgical interventions; uterine balloon tamponade is a mechanical method used to control bleeding. We present an atypical case of secondary PPH in a 36-year-old multiparous woman with an uncomplicated antenatal course who experienced a spontaneous vaginal delivery complicated by manual removal of the placenta and primary PPH with an estimated blood loss of 3500 ml. She later presented with recurrent secondary PPH, prompting transfer to a regional tertiary care centre for further investigation. Imaging and multidisciplinary evaluation revealed uterine perforation associated with a uterine balloon tamponade. Surgical intervention via midline laparotomy was performed for uterine repair. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for uterine injury in persistent or atypical secondary PPH, particularly when mechanical interventions such as balloon tamponade are employed. Early recognition and multidisciplinary management are critical to optimising outcomes. A literature review is included to contextualise this rare but serious complication."

    "abstract": "Perforated gastric cancer (GC) is a rare but life-threatening surgical emergency. Optimal surgical management remains controversial, and evidence from high-volume centers, especially in Western countries, is limited. To evaluate surgical and survival outcomes of patients with perforated GC (PGC) according to the initial treatment strategy. A retrospective cohort study was conducted including all patients with pathologically confirmed perforated gastric adenocarcinoma treated at a single tertiary cancer center between January 2009 and March 2024. Surgical strategies were categorized as gastrectomy or primary perforation repair. Outcomes analyzed included 30- and 90-day mortality, postoperative major complications, and overall survival (OS). Among 1586 GC patients undergoing surgical treatment, 36 (2.3%) presented with PGC. The mean age was 62.5 years, and 55% were male. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class III/IV was present in 58.3%, and 83% had stage IV disease, with distant metastasis in 50%. Perforation repair was performed in 26 patients (72.2%), while 10 (27.8%) underwent one-stage gastrectomy. ASA III/IV status (57.7% vs 30%, P = 0.260) and metastatic disease (57.7% vs 30%, P = 0.137) were more frequent in the Perforation Repair Group, though not statistically significant. This group also had a higher rate of diffuse-type and poorly differentiated tumors (P = 0.024 and P = 0.014, respectively). Thirty- and 90-day mortality were higher in the Perforation Repair Group (61.5% vs 30%, P = 0.139; and 65.4% vs 30%, P = 0.073), without significance. Three patients initially repaired were later referred for gastrectomy. OS was significantly better in the Gastrectomy Group (P = 0.002), with median survival of 8.8 months vs 0.5 months. On multivariable analysis, gastrectomy was independently associated with improved survival (P = 0.026). When clinically feasible, gastrectomy-either immediate or delayed-provides superior survival compared to local perforation repair alone in patients with PGC."

    "title": "Prospective Randomised Control Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Hypochlorous Acid as a Peritoneal Lavage Agent to Prevent Surgical Site Infection After Exploratory Laparotomy for Perforation Peritonitis.",
    "abstract": "Introduction Surgical site infections (SSIs) are a major concern following emergency gastrointestinal procedures, particularly exploratory laparotomy for perforation peritonitis, where infection risk is amplified by the inherent contamination of the operative field. Despite prophylactic antibiotics, the microbial burden frequently surpasses host defence thresholds. Intraoperative peritoneal lavage with antimicrobial agents such as hypochlorous acid (HOCl) has emerged as a promising strategy, combining physical removal of contaminants with direct microbicidal action. Methods This was a prospective, randomized controlled trial and 148 patients were included in the study who presented with peritonitis secondary to gastrointestinal perforation. Participants were randomly assigned to receive intraoperative lavage using either HOCl (Group A) or normal saline (Group B). The primary endpoint was the rate of SSIs within 30 days postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included early wound progression, postoperative fever, and rates of wound healing by postoperative days 15 and 30. Additional variables such as patient demographics, comorbidities, surgical parameters, and anatomical factors were evaluated. Results The HOCl group demonstrated a marked reduction in SSI incidence (20.3%) compared to the saline group (39.2%), yielding an absolute risk reduction of 19%. Early postoperative indicators - wound severity escalation and fever by day 3 - were predictive of subsequent SSI. No statistically significant associations were found between infection rates and patient-related or operative variables. By day 15, 79% of patients in the HOCl group showed complete wound healing, significantly outperforming the saline group (50%, p<0.001). All HOCl-treated wounds achieved complete healing by day 30. No adverse reactions or resistant organisms were identified among HOCl intraperitoneal lavage recipients. Conclusion Intraperitoneal hypochlorous acid lavage has a significant role in reducing the rate of SSI in perforation peritonitis cases."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous gallbladder perforation is an infrequent but life-threatening complication of acute cholecystitis, often associated with rapid clinical deterioration and high mortality. Prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention are critical. Atypical presentations in gallbladder perforation, especially if silent, often delay recognition and treatment, increasing the risk of adverse outcomes. We present the case of a 68-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with generalized weakness. Notably, he reported an episode of severe abdominal pain two weeks prior, which had since resolved. Vital signs and physical exam were normal. Imaging demonstrated pneumobilia and a pericholecystic fluid collection consistent with a contained gallbladder perforation. The patient underwent urgent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which revealed a mid-body gallbladder perforation with extensive gallstone spillage and purulent drainage. Pathology confirmed gangrenous cholecystitis. He recovered uneventfully following surgery and was discharged on postoperative day seven, with no complications noted at his two-week follow-up. This case illustrates a rare presentation of a type II gallbladder perforation that remained clinically silent for two weeks, without signs of peritonitis or systemic compromise. Clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for serious intra-abdominal pathology in elderly patients presenting with vague or atypical symptoms, to ensure timely diagnosis and intervention in cases of gallbladder perforation."

    "abstract": "Diverticular disease is one of the most common gastrointestinal pathologies, and its prevalence is rising in areas where diets are low in fiber and high in processed foods containing preservatives and emulsifiers. While this commonly affects the colon, in rare cases, chronic diverticulitis can lead to scarring and fibrosis that impact the small bowel. This case report describes the clinical course of a 56-year-old male with multiple comorbidities who presented to the emergency department for acute abdominal pain with worsening abdominal distention. Imaging revealed extensive intraperitoneal free air, and he was emergently taken for an exploratory laparotomy. Surgery revealed feculent peritonitis, multiple bowel perforations, and a closed-loop small bowel obstruction between the tethered area of pelvic adhesions and a large bowel obstruction extending from the ileocecal valve to the stricture in the distal large bowel. This report highlights the uncommon presentation of simultaneous small and large bowel obstructions originating from related but distinct mechanisms, and emphasizes the importance of understanding how chronic diverticulitis can lead to significant and life-threatening complications. It emphasizes the need to identify causes of bowel ischemia and illustrates the critical role of a multidisciplinary team in managing complex postoperative complications and maintaining nutritional status in patients with significant comorbidities."

We report the case of a 76-year-old female with multiple comorbidities who presented with acute left-sided abdominal pain and a tender, irreducible mass. Computed tomography imaging revealed a left lateral ventral hernia containing an inflamed diverticulum of the transverse colon. The patient underwent emergency hybrid laparoscopic surgery involving hernia sac resection, diverticulectomy, and primary abdominal wall repair. Her postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged on Day 5. This unusual presentation mimics both incarcerated hernia and acute diverticulitis, complicating diagnosis. Early imaging and prompt surgical management are vital to prevent life-threatening complications such as strangulation or perforation. This case emphasizes the importance of clinical awareness and individualized surgical strategies in managing complex ventral hernias. A multidisciplinary approach is essential for optimizing outcomes in rare and challenging abdominal emergencies."

    "abstract": "Intussusception is a medical emergency requiring reduction with a pneumatic or hydrostatic enema. Although evidence supports the safety of medications to reduce distress during the procedure, their use remains limited. This quality improvement (QI) project aimed to provide analgesic and anxiolytic medications to all eligible patients undergoing pneumatic reduction within 1 year. A multidisciplinary team developed a standardized clinical pathway to provide both intranasal fentanyl and midazolam for all patients undergoing intussusception reduction. The interventions included staff education, team engagement, and process interventions through sequential Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles. The primary outcome measure was pathway provision. Process measures included documentation of pain and sedation scores, while balancing measures assessed adverse events, failed reductions, and perforation rates. Over the project period, 25 patients were diagnosed with intussusception. Two patients with lead points proceeded directly to surgery. Among the 23 patients with planned pneumatic reduction, 19 (82%) had successful reductions, 2 had spontaneous reductions, and 2 required surgical intervention due to failed reductions. Pathway provision improved from 0% at baseline to 100% by the project's end. Pain score documentation reached 100%. No cases of serious adverse events or intestinal perforation were reported. Pathway compliance remained at 100% during the sustainment period. The interval number of days between patients who did not receive analgesia and anxiolysis was short initially but progressively lengthened. This QI initiative improved rates of analgesic and anxiolytic provision to reduce distress in patients undergoing intussusception reduction, without adverse outcomes. This project highlights the effectiveness of structured interventions in optimizing pediatric procedural pain management and potentially serves as a model for spread to other pediatric emergency departments."

    "abstract": "Evaluation of pancreatic stone protein (PSP) plasma levels has been proven effective in predicting unfavourable outcomes in patients with Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP), infection after cardiothoracic surgery and peritonitis. It is also being studied as a sepsis biomarker with promising results compared to other commonly used biomarkers. We aim to validate PSP in septic patients with community acquired infections. This will help to establish its role in point-of-care settings. Adult patients consecutively admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of a tertiary medical centre, with the diagnosis of intra-abdominal infection (IAI), urinary tract infection (UTI) and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled. PSP was measured in whole blood, within one hour since admission, by spectrophotometry using abioSCOPE device. Statistical analysis was performed, and a cut-off value for PSP to predict the composite outcome of sepsis, readmission, antibiotic treatment escalation and need for invasive treatment was estimated. Patients were followed for 28 days to document their outcomes. A total of one hundred and one (n = 101) patients were included. Forty-five were male. The most common comorbidity was hypertension (33%). Fifty-three (52.5%) had LRTI, thirty-seven (36.6%) had UTI and nineteen (18.8%) had IAI. Thirteen of them had more than one type of infection. Our primary outcome met statistical significance, as PSP predicted the composite outcome of sepsis, readmission, antibiotic treatment escalation and need of invasive treatment with an Area Under Curve (AUC) =0.844 (95% CI 0.767-0.920), in the optimal cut-off of 48.5 ng/ml. PSP predicted sepsis with an AUC = 0.892 (95% CI 0.826-0.956) and was also an independent risk factor for sepsis and mortality after age adjustment. PSP was superior to the common used sepsis biomarkers, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate dehydrogonase (LDH)/albumin ratio, White Blood Cell count (WBC), fibrinogen and lactate both for sepsis and for the composite outcome. It was also correlated with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) day 1 (D1), SOFA peak and qSOFA and its prognostic value was independent of renal function, despite being inversely proportional to estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), reflecting the sepsis-related acute kidney injury (SAKI). PSP is a valuable biomarker that can rule out patients who do not have sepsis and are not in high risk to develop sepsis the following days, giving valuable insights regarding their antimicrobial coverage and management in general. It seems to be superior to other biomarkers in sepsis prediction and adequately compatible with frequently used sepsis assessment scores, such as SOFA. In the Emergency Department setting PSP can distinguish infected patients at high risk for sepsis who have low qSOFA scores."

    "abstract": "Standardized care pathways for appendicitis are safe and effective ways to minimize practice variation and optimize resource allocation. This project aims to improve appendectomy outcomes through the implementation of an enterprise-wide pathway for appendicitis across a multi-hospital children's healthcare system (Nemours Children's Hospital- Delaware (NCH-DE) and Nemours Children's Hospital-Florida (NCH-FL). A multidisciplinary team was convened to create a standard approach to care for patients with appendicitis across the Nemours enterprise. The pathway included standardized antibiotic selection of ceftriaxone and metronidazole, discharge criteria, and a multimodal opioid-sparing analgesic regimen. We evaluated post-operative length of stay (LOS), narcotic prescription at or after discharge, return to emergency department (ED) visits and readmissions 1 year pre- and post-pathway implementation. Special cause variation (SCV) was defined as having eight points above or below center line according to standard criteria. A total of 560 patients pre-implementation and 781 post-implementation were analyzed. LOS at NCH-FL decreased for both uncomplicated (mean 0.19 to 0.12 days) and complicated appendicitis (mean 3.87 days-3.28 days), both meeting criteria for SCV. NCH-DE LOS remained stable for both uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis. Narcotic prescriptions at NCH-FL decreased from 35.0 % to 0 % after pathway implementation. NCH-DE baseline narcotic prescription rate was 0.2 % and it remained stable at 0 % post-implementation. There were no increases in returns to system. An appendicitis pathway can successfully be scaled and implemented across a children's hospital system, decreasing LOS and narcotic prescriptions at discharge without increasing returns to the system."

    "abstract": "Recent retrospective and prospective studies have demonstrated the safety of delayed surgery for acute appendicitis. However, evidence regarding delayed surgery in elderly patients is limited, and it is unclear whether it is safe to delay appendectomy in this patient population. The outcomes of patients aged 65 years and older who underwent appendectomy for suspected appendicitis at a single institution were reviewed and analyzed. The outcomes investigated were perforation rate and complication rate. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to adjust for risk factors and calculate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for in-hospital delay. A total of 525 patients aged 65 years and older underwent appendectomy for suspected appendicitis. The perforation rate was 44.4% (233 of 525) and the complication rate was 25.1%. The multivariable analysis showed no association between a waiting time of more than 12 h compared to less than 12 h and perforation rate (aOR 0.96; 95% CI 0.55-1.70; p = 0.90) or complication rate (aOR 0.93; 95% CI 0.49-1.76; p = 0.83). A risk factor for perforation in the multivariable analysis was an elevated CRP level ≥ 50 mg/L and risk factors for complications were suspected perforation on preoperative imaging (p = 0.004), anticoagulant use (p = 0.04), and CRP levels ≥ 150 mg/L (p < 0.001). This large retrospective analysis showed that it is safe to delay surgery by 12 h in patients aged 65 years and older. Delayed surgery was not associated with a higher rate of perforation or complications after adjusting for risk factors. These results open the possibility of optimizing coagulation or possible comorbidities in elderly patients before surgery or postponing surgery when more critical cases require more urgent treatment. In patients with suspected perforation on imaging, the decision to delay surgery should me made with caution, taking into account the patient's overall presentation, comorbidities, and vital signs."

This study assesses the prognostic value of the red blood cell to platelet ratio (RPR) in these patients with abdominal sepsis. Clinical data from MIMIC-IV and a hospital validation set were retrospectively analyzed. Demographics, comorbidities, and lab indices were extracted; missing values were imputed using random forest. RPR's dynamic changes and relation to prognosis were analyzed using latent category trajectory modeling. Prognostic factors were screened via Lasso-Cox regression to build column-line graph models. Kaplan-Meier, log-rank tests, and restricted cubic splines analyzed RPR-outcome associations. R 4.2.3 was used; P < 0.05 was significant. A total of 243 patients were enrolled in MIMIC-IV and 253 patients were enrolled in the hospital. RPR was a significant prognostic indicator. Elevated RPR correlated with coagulation dysfunction (increased PT/INR, decreased fibrinogen) and higher mortality risk. Trajectory analysis identified two RPR patterns; Class 1 had significantly lower 28-day mortality than Class 2. The hospitalization and ICU prognostic models demonstrated good efficacy. Validation set results supported these findings, indicating dynamic RPR changes effectively assess prognosis. The red blood cell to platelet ratio may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker for abdominal septic patients, influencing clotting and kidney function."

    "abstract": "For more than 100 years, physicians and patients considered appendicitis a surgical emergency requiring hospitalization for urgent removal of the obstructed and inflamed appendix to prevent rupture and sepsis. With the advent of modern imaging, uncomplicated appendicitis is identifiable, and later evidence showed that surgical delay does not increase the risk of appendiceal perforation. Perforation appears to be a separate disease, with uncomplicated appendicitis likely related to infection, which sometimes self-resolves. Most recently, studies compared nonoperative treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis with antibiotics and observation followed by selective surgery to urgent appendectomy, including 4 multicenter trials involving more than 2,000 adults and 2,000 children. The results led the American College of Surgeons to endorse nonoperative treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis as a safe alternative treatment. Furthermore, emergency department discharge and outpatient management appears feasible in as many as 90% of nonoperative treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis-treated patients. We review methods and results of these trials and evaluate implications for emergency care."

We report a unique case of a triple gastro-colic fistula, identified during an emergency surgical intervention after radiological replacement of a PEG one year following its initial placement. An 83-year-old man with Parkinson's-related dysphagia underwent PEG placement. One year later, following catheter occlusion, it was replaced radiologically. The next day, the patient developed abdominal pain and diarrhea, and imaging revealed catheter misplacement into the transverse colon. Surgical exploration identified three chronic and dehiscent fistulous tracts involving the stomach, transverse colon, and sigmoid colon. The patient was treated with colonic resection, gastric double-layer suture, and surgical gastrostomy. Recovery was uneventful and the patient was discharged on postoperative day eight. This is the first reported case of a triple gastro-colic fistula following PEG placement. The case highlights that early recognition and multidisciplinary management of PEG-related complications are crucial. Prompt diagnosis and the availability of a specific Acute Care Department are essential for the effective management of such complex scenarios."

Perforation is associated with short-term mortality and morbidity in up to 30% and 50% of patients, respectively, due to secondary peritonitis and sepsis. We hypothesized that postoperative clinical outcomes after colorectal perforation (CRP) are worse than those with stomach perforation (SP). This retrospective study aimed to compare the early postoperative clinical outcomes of patients with stomach and colorectal perforations, focusing on morbidity and mortality, and identify differences that could indicate potential changes in surgical management. Data from 214 patients who underwent surgery for stomach and colorectal perforations were retrospectively reviewed. We compared the demographic, intraoperative, and postoperative data, including morbidity and mortality during hospitalization of the two groups of patients. One group consisted of patients with SP, and the second group consisted of patients with CRP. The incidences of postoperative cardiac, gastrointestinal, and nephrological complications; sepsis; planned reoperation; reoperation due to complications; median operation time; median blood loss; and median hospital stay after surgery were significantly higher in patients with CRP than in those with SP. After adjusting for potential confounders such as BMI and nicotine use using a logistic regression model, we observed additional that the incidence of postoperative surgical complications was significantly higher in the CRP group compared to the SP group. Peritonitis was significantly more common in the SP group. In addition, overall medical complications and mortality were common in the total patient population and were higher in the CRP than in SP group; however, these differences were not statistically significant. Mortality and morbidity rates following surgery for SP and CRP were similar and often life threatening. However, patients with CRP experience worse clinical outcomes more often, indicating a more complex injury requiring considerably more medical intervention and extended treatment."

Splenic injury is an exceedingly rare, potentially life-threatening complication of ESWL. We feature the 4th report since 2020 and 14th overall since practice inception in 1980. Despite the resources of a large level 1 trauma center, our case highlights non-operative management may not be pragmatic in the emergent circumstance. Patient and provider education and early recognition remain key to optimize outcomes."

    "abstract": "Oropharyngeal injuries in young children, though common, carry the potential risk of serious complications. Here, we describe a rare case of a toddler with a minor penetrating injury in the hypopharynx leading to perforation, surgical emphysema, and pneumomediastinum. A 2-year-old boy was brought to the emergency department with noisy breathing and shortness of breath that started after a traumatic injury with a pencil in the mouth. He was found to have tachycardia, tachypnea, and grunting, but no stridor or retractions. A brief oral exam showed a blackish discoloration in the posterior pharyngeal wall, and crepitations were palpated on the neck. Imaging revealed extensive subcutaneous emphysema and a defect in the posterior oropharyngeal wall. He underwent surgical repair of the pharyngeal defect and was later discharged in stable condition. This case highlights the need for vigilance in assessing oral impalement injuries in children, as such injuries can lead to significant complications. Early detection and management are crucial to prevent severe outcomes. The case underscores the importance of careful clinical and radiological evaluation in managing pediatric oral impalement injuries."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis demonstrates significant sex-based variations in incidence, presentation, and outcomes, yet such disparities have not been well studied. This study aimed to investigate sex-based differences in time to appendectomy in patients with acute appendicitis. The 2013-2017 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was used to identify all patients ≥18 y with acute appendicitis undergoing emergency appendectomy. Delayed appendectomy was defined as that performed >12 h following admission. Multivariable logistic regression adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, disease severity, and surgical approach was used to examine the association between sex and delayed appendectomy. We further evaluated the association between delayed appendectomy and secondary outcomes, including mortality and postoperative complications. 117,682 patients were included: 57,067 (48.5%) males and 60,615 (51.5%) females. The mean time to appendectomy was 5.7 ± 10.7 h in females compared to 5.0 ± 10.1 h in males (P < 0.001). On multivariable analyses, female patients were more likely to experience delayed appendectomy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-1.20) and postoperative bleeding requiring transfusion (aOR 1.76, 95% CI 1.37-2.24) compared to males. In addition, delayed appendectomy was associated with a higher risk of unplanned reoperation (aOR 1.16, 95% CI 1.01-1.35), 30-day readmission (aOR 1.09, 95% CI 1.01-1.19), and prolonged hospital stay (aOR 5.76, 95% CI 5.51-6.03). Female patients with acute appendicitis are more likely to experience delayed appendectomy. These findings highlight the need for further studies to address sex-based disparities in the management of acute appendicitis."

    "title": "Endoscopic Retrieval of Ingested Button Battery From a Colonic Diverticulum in an Alzheimer's Patient: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Foreign body (FB) ingestion is a common problem in children. In a report of adult FB ingestion, 56% of cases involved individuals with mental illness; the most common foreign bodies were batteries (23%), drug-filled balloons for intervention (17%), razor blades (16%), and others. Standard management of an accidentally swallowed button battery (BB) is radiographic evaluation followed by natural passage through the gastrointestinal tract after traversing the esophagus and stomach. Although cases of BB retention in Meckel's diverticulum have been documented, no reports have described retention in a colonic diverticulum. CASE REPORT An 88-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease presented with retention of a BB in an ascending colonic diverticulum. Multi-detector computed tomography images showed a radiopaque foreign body near the duodenal bulb. Based on the diagnosis of an ingested BB in the duodenal bulb, emergency upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed 2 h after admission. However, an abdominal radiograph obtained after admission showed that the BB had migrated into the right colon. Colonoscopy performed the same day revealed that the BB had entered an ascending colonic diverticulum, from which it was successfully removed. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of BB retention in a colonic diverticulum. CONCLUSIONS Retention of a BB in the colonic diverticulum, which poses a risk of perforation, should be considered in patients undergoing colonoscopy for suspected foreign body ingestion."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis (AA) is a frequent surgical emergency. Although laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) is associated with favorable postoperative outcomes, open appendectomy (OA) remains widely used. Surgical site infection (SSI) is a common complication, with obesity recognized as a risk factor. However, body mass index (BMI) may not reliably reflect fat distribution. Subcutaneous fat thickness (SFT) measured on computed tomography (CT) may offer improved predictive value for surgical outcomes. This retrospective study included 1,231 patients who underwent LA or OA for AA between 2017 and 2022. Preoperative SFT was measured on CT, and patients were analyzed by surgical technique and SFT subgroups. Postoperative complications, including SSI, were recorded. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified the SFT threshold associated with increased SSI risk. Despite similar BMI values between groups, SFT was significantly higher in LA patients (P < .001), highlighting the nonlinear relationship between BMI and SFT. LA was associated with shorter operative time (P = .004), reduced hospital stay (P = .009), and lower SSI rate (5.6% vs 13.5%, P < .001). Among patients with SFT ≥33 mm, LA resulted in significantly fewer SSIs (22 vs 50, P < .001) and shorter hospitalizations. ROC analysis confirmed SFT ≥33 mm as a strong predictor of SSI (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.841). LA offers superior outcomes compared to open surgery, particularly in patients with higher SFT. The discrepancy between BMI and SFT underscores the need for direct fat measurement in surgical risk assessment. Incorporating SFT into preoperative evaluation can guide optimal surgical strategy and improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "The use of amniotic membranes for corneal perforation management has been extensively documented, demonstrating significant potential in ocular surface reconstruction. However, their application in emergency settings remains underexplored. This report presents a novel use of freeze-dried umbilical cord amniotic membrane as a corneal patch graft, highlighting its practical benefits in urgent clinical scenarios. A 64-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a painful, red eye, having a history of penetrating keratoplasty. Slit-lamp examination revealed a severe corneal abscess with a 3 mm-wide paracentral perforation. Emergency surgery was performed using a freeze-dried umbilical cord amniotic membrane (SclerFix, Amtrix®, TBF) with a \"mushroom plug and patch\" technique, combined with a fresh amniotic membrane overlay. Postoperative treatment included oral antibiotics, topical antifungal agents, and antibiotic eye drops. The fresh amniotic membrane dissolved within days, while the freeze-dried umbilical cord membrane facilitated rapid re-epithelialization, effectively sealing the perforation. At three months postoperatively, the cornea remained intact without recurrence or complications, and the patient reported complete pain resolution. This case demonstrates the successful use of freeze-dried umbilical cord amniotic membrane as a corneal patch graft, avoiding emergency keratoplasty and preserving ocular integrity. This technique represents a promising alternative in situations where corneal grafts are not readily available. Further studies are warranted to validate its efficacy."

    "abstract": "Appendicectomy is an important index procedure for core surgical trainees (CSTs). However, there are growing concerns that reduced operative exposure due to service pressures and working time restrictions may be limiting CST experience. This study aimed to assess the extent of CST involvement in appendicectomies at a district general hospital in the United Kingdom and to compare the safety, efficacy, and outcomes of procedures performed across different grades of surgeons. A retrospective review was conducted of all appendicectomies performed between December 2023 and June 2024. Demographic, perioperative, and postoperative data were extracted from electronic records. Patients undergoing appendicectomy for non-appendicitis indications were excluded. Cases were categorised by the primary operator: consultant, registrar, or CST. Data were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States). Continuous and categorical variables were compared across surgeon grades using appropriate parametric or non-parametric tests. Variables with significant or clinically relevant differences were entered into multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for key confounders, with results reported as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results: A total of 254 appendicectomies were analysed: 46 (18.1%) consultant-led, 170 (66.9%) registrar-led, and 38 (15.0%) CST-led. Median patient age was 31 years (IQR 29), with no significant difference in gender or American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status distribution across groups. Consultants operated on older patients with higher pre-operative C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (p < 0.001), reflecting more complex cases. Case complexity varied significantly by operator grade (p = 0.012). Operative duration, length of stay, complication rate, and readmission rate were similar across all grades (p > 0.05). In adjusted analyses, surgeon grade was not an independent predictor of complications (CST vs consultant: adjusted OR 2.85, 95%CI 0.67-12.00, p > 0.05) or readmissions (CST vs consultant: adjusted OR 1.70, 95%CI 0.34-8.64, p > 0.05). CSTs performed significantly fewer appendicectomies than registrars yet achieved comparable outcomes when given the opportunity. No differences were found in operative duration, complication, or readmission rates between grades. These findings support increased supervised autonomy and equitable case allocation for CSTs to ensure adequate operative exposure and preparedness for higher surgical training. National evaluation of trainee involvement in index procedures is warranted to optimise training and workforce sustainability."

    "abstract": "Ileosigmoid knot (ISK) is a rare, life-threatening cause of intestinal obstruction characterized by a double volvulus involving the ileum and sigmoid colon. This case report highlights distinctive CT findings that facilitate early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention. A 75-year-old male with chronic constipation and prior midline laparotomy presented with acute bowel obstruction without peritonitis. CT revealed a whirl sign involving both superior and inferior mesenteric artery branches, adjacent ileal loops, and an obliquely oriented torsion, suggestive of ISK. Emergency laparotomy confirmed a Type I ISK, enabling timely detorsion and prophylactic sigmoidectomy before ischemic complications developed. ISK should be suspected when CT demonstrates a whirl sign incorporating both superior and inferior mesenteric artery branches, adjacent ileal loops, and a torsion extending across multiple contiguous slices. These findings distinguish ISK from isolated sigmoid volvulus, guiding appropriate surgical management to optimize outcomes in this rare entity."

Concurrence of both of these pathologies is rare and diagnostically challenging due to the overlapping clinical features. We report a case of a 40-year-old female with several emergency visits, presenting with atypical presentation of intermittent bilateral flank pain, subjective fever and vomiting. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed bilateral TOA, with the appendix initially presumed to exhibit reactionary inflammation. Subsequent surgical intervention and histological findings later confirmed acute suppurative appendicitis in the presence of bilateral TOA, after which the patient showed clinical improvement. This emphasizes the importance of radiological imaging modalities in detecting coexisting abdominal-pelvic diagnoses, which may otherwise be overlooked. Highlighting the importance of considering dual pathology and having high clinical suspicion, as early identification of these diagnoses is critical for appropriate treatment planning and improved outcomes."

    "abstract": "A minimalist approach to transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has accompanied the increase in TAVR procedures worldwide. Comprehensive evidence regarding the safety of non-anesthetist-led conscious sedation for TAVR is lacking. We aimed to evaluate the outcomes of patients undergoing TAVR with non-anesthetist-led conscious sedation. This retrospective analysis included consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous transfemoral TAVR with non-anesthetist-led conscious sedation, from March 2018 to 2025, in a single high-volume center. Thirty-day outcomes were assessed. Of 2854 patients who underwent TAVR, 2000 (70.1%) had non-anesthetist-led conscious sedation (age: 80.7 ± 6.5 years, 42.1% female). The annual proportion of non-anesthetist-led conscious sedation procedures increased from 37% (2018-2019) to 81% (2024-2025). Fentanyl was administered to 1986 (99.3%) patients (median: 75 mcg [IQR: 50-100]) and Midazolam to 945 (47.3%) patients (median: 1.5 mg [IQR: 1.0-2.0]). Mean procedural duration was 81.3 ± 67.7 min. Emergency anesthetic support was required for 53 (2.7%) patients, due to: vascular access complications (n = 15), cardiac arrest (n = 14), annular rupture/aortic dissection (n = 9), profound hypotension (n = 8), agitation (n = 4), ventricular perforation (n = 2) and reduced consciousness (stroke) (n = 1). Conversion to general anesthesia was required for 24 (1.2%) patients. Emergency bail-out surgery (cardiac/vascular) was undertaken in 15 patients (0.75%). Among the 2000 patients, 30-day mortality was 1.3%, and VARC-3 technical success, device success, and early safety were achieved in 97.2%, 92.7%, and 78.9% of patients, respectively. Non-anesthetist-led conscious sedation can be delivered safely in most patients undergoing percutaneous transfemoral TAVR. The need for emergency anesthetic support is low."

    "title": "Atypical Presentation of Boerhaave Syndrome with Left Shoulder Pain as the Initial Manifestation: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND This report describes a rare spontaneous esophageal rupture presenting as left shoulder pain. Spontaneous transmural rupture, or Boerhaave syndrome, is a surgical emergency with high morbidity and mortality but is often missed due to atypical signs. Mackler's triad of vomiting, acute chest pain, and subcutaneous emphysema raises concern for this diagnosis but appears in only about 50% of cases, emphasizing early recognition and high suspicion in atypical presentations. CASE REPORT We present a rare case of an Asian man in his 90s with hypertension presenting with left shoulder pain and chest discomfort, accompanied by a mild cough. Physical examination revealed that a crunching sound known as Hamman's sign was heard synchronous with the heartbeat. The chest X-ray showed air in the neck's soft tissue. Computed tomography (CT) and endoscopy confirmed a mid-esophageal perforation despite initial suspicion of a muscle sprain. Notably, symptom onset followed a forceful pulling maneuver on a bedside rail to sit up, an exertional Valsalva-like strain that can acutely increase intra-esophageal pressure and is a plausible precipitant of Boerhaave syndrome. The patient died 21 days later after a do not resuscitate (DNR) order was signed. We report this uncommon case and discuss the diagnostic challenges. CONCLUSIONS This case emphasizes the importance of promptly identifying esophageal perforation in patients with vague symptoms. Early imaging and intervention are essential, and Boerhaave syndrome should be suspected when unexplained shoulder or chest pain coexists with Hamman's sign or cervical subcutaneous emphysema."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common surgical emergency, most frequently caused by postoperative adhesions. However, neoplastic etiologies, including malignant lymphoma, should also be considered in the differential diagnosis. A 78-year-old Japanese man with a history of recurrent SBO since 2021 presented with nausea and abdominal distention. He had previously undergone conservative treatment on seven occasions. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed small bowel dilatation with segmental wall thickening and enhanced contrast effect, along with enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. He was diagnosed with SBO and admitted for emergency treatment. An ileus tube was inserted, and contrast study on day 3 revealed a stricture in the ileum, which the tube could not pass. Adhesive ileus and small intestinal tumor were both considered. As conservative treatment was ineffective, laparoscopic-assisted segmental ileal resection was performed. Histopathological examination revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and he was discharged on postoperative day 21. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed FDG uptake in mesenteric lymph nodes (SUVmax 3.7), consistent with Lugano stage II disease. Due to advanced age and dementia, the patient did not undergo chemotherapy. He remains under surgical follow-up without disease progression one year postoperatively. This case highlights that repeated SBO may not always be caused by adhesions alone, and intestinal lymphoma should be considered, especially when imaging reveals suspicious findings. In cases of recurrent SBO, small intestinal lymphoma should be included in the differential diagnosis, even in elderly patients with a history of abdominal surgery."

Preoperative computed tomography (CT) can be useful for identifying the viability of eviscerated small bowel and other intra-abdominal pathologies. In this study, we report the case of an 81-year-old woman who presented with sudden anal protrusion of small bowel loops. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a rectal wall defect, pneumoperitoneum, and herniation of the small bowel with features suggestive of strangulation. Emergency laparotomy revealed a firmly impacted ileal segment plugging a perforation at the rectosigmoid junction, likely due to increased intraabdominal pressure, necessitating small bowel resection and the Hartmann procedure. Early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention led to a favorable postoperative course. This case highlights the critical role of CT in identifying rectal perforation and intrarectal small bowel evisceration."

    "abstract": "Emergency right hemicolectomy is a surgical intervention performed in life-threatening conditions such as colonic obstruction, ischemia, perforation, or massive hemorrhage, and it carries a high risk of morbidity and mortality. To restore the continuity of the gastrointestinal tract after surgery, various anastomosis techniques are employed. However, the clinical outcomes of these techniques under emergency conditions remain unclear. This study aims to compare the effects of different anastomosis methods used in open surgery on postoperative complications, mortality, pathological compatibility, and length of hospital stay. This retrospective, single-center observational study included 143 adult patients who underwent emergency open right hemicolectomy between January 1, 2021, and August 31, 2024. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on the anastomosis technique used: hand-sewn, linear stapler, and circular stapler anastomosis. Demographic data, surgical indications, postoperative complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification, 1 month follow-up outcomes, pathological concordance, and length of hospital stay were evaluated. Of the patients, 60.1% were male, and the mean age was 56.79 ± 18.04 years. Linear stapler (48.3%), hand-sewn (28%), and circular stapler (23.7%) techniques were used. The overall anastomotic leakage rate was 6.3%, with no statistically significant difference among the techniques (P > .05). The mortality rate was 5.6%, and the malignancy rate was 71.3%. No significant association was found between the type of anastomosis and postoperative complications, mortality, or length of hospital stay. The choice of anastomosis technique in emergency open right hemicolectomy does not significantly affect morbidity or mortality. The optimal approach is for the surgeon to employ the technique with which they have the greatest experience. Due to the potential to reduce operative time, the use of staplers is recommended in high-volume centers."

    "abstract": "BackgroundNon-traumatic bile duct perforation in adults is a rare and often under-recognized surgical emergency. Its non-specific clinical presentation and variable etiologies pose significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This systematic review synthesizes existing data on clinical presentation, diagnostic strategies, management approaches, and outcomes.MethodsThis systematic review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Initially prepared as a narrative review and subsequently advanced to systematic methodology, this study was not prospectively registered. A comprehensive search of English-language publications from 1882 to 2024 was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and reference lists. All studies reporting adult cases (≥18 years) of non-traumatic bile duct perforation were included. Exclusion criteria were pediatric cases, traumatic/iatrogenic perforations, non-English language, and unavailable full text. Data extraction included demographics, etiology, presentation, diagnosis, management, and outcomes. Missing data were documented and reported for each variable. ASA classification was retrospectively assigned based on clinical descriptions when not explicitly stated, representing a study limitation. Management approaches were categorized by temporal era to assess the evolution from traditional to minimally invasive techniques. Mortality risk factors were analyzed using chi-square test with P < 0.05 considered significant.ResultsFrom 102 eligible studies containing 223 reports, 124 adult cases of non-traumatic bile duct perforation met inclusion criteria (median age 56 years, IQR 38-68; 71.4% female). Stone-related etiology was identified in 54.0% (n = 67): choledocholithiasis (36.3%, n = 45) and cholelithiasis without choledocholithiasis (21.8%, n = 27). Clinical presentation was characterized by abdominal pain (99.1%, n = 112/113), tenderness (96.5%, n = 109/113), and vomiting (87.6%, n = 99/113). Median time to diagnosis was 3 days (IQR 1-7). Diagnostic modalities evolved significantly across eras: from 0 modalities (1880-1940) to 3.4 modalities (2010-2023). Ultrasonography (42.1%, n = 45/107) and CT (31.8%, n = 34/107) were most frequently used. Paracentesis demonstrated 91% positivity when performed (n = 38/97). Surgical treatment, primarily cholecystectomy with T-tube placement (72.8%, n = 83/114), was performed in 73.7% (n = 84/114). Preoperative ERCP was performed in 23.2% (n = 13/56). Overall mortality was 17.7% (n = 20/113), showing dramatic improvement from 45.7% (1880-1940) to 0% (2011-2023). Preoperative ERCP demonstrated a protective effect (0% vs 17% mortality). Hypotension at presentation (P = 0.086) and elevated WBC (P = 0.051) showed trends toward increased mortality.ConclusionsNon-traumatic bile duct perforation carries considerable morbidity and mortality. The evolution from purely surgical to combined endoscopic-surgical approaches has dramatically improved outcomes. A high index of suspicion and prompt use of paracentesis or cholangiographic studies (ERCP, MRCP) are critical for timely diagnosis. Treatment should be tailored to patient stability and perforation characteristics, with ERCP-based interventions favored in stable patients and immediate surgical intervention reserved for unstable or extensive cases. Early recognition and individualized, minimally invasive management strategies are key to improving patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Coronary artery perforation (CAP) during percutaneous coronary intervention carries significant morbidity and mortality; however, data are limited regarding the specific role of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) in evaluating and guiding management after CAP occurs and whether this approach improves clinical outcomes. This study consisted of a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and experienced CAP treated with covered stents at a single tertiary care hospital between December 2014 and January 2024. The primary outcome was target vessel revascularization (TVR). Secondary outcomes included mortality, myocardial infarction, in-stent restenosis, and emergency cardiac surgery. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association between IVUS and outcomes. Between 2014 and January 2024, 127 cases of CAP treated using covered stents were identified. Of these, 34 patients (26.8%) underwent IVUS-guided covered stent optimization, whereas 93 patients (73.2%) did not undergo IVUS. Patients in the IVUS group were older (75.1 ± 8.4 vs 61.0 ± 10.3 years; P < .001) and predominantly women (55.9% vs 31.2%; P = .020). The IVUS was more frequently used for left anterior descending artery perforations (64.7% vs 36.6%; P = .009). IVUS was associated with a reduced risk of TVR during an average follow-up of 60.3 months (adjusted odds ratio, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.02-0.56; P = .031). Other outcomes, including mortality and repeat myocardial infarction, were similar between the 2 groups. The use of IVUS in patients requiring covered stents for CAP treatment, despite higher procedural complexity and a higher prevalence of severe perforations, was associated with significantly reduced TVR. This suggests a potential role for IVUS in improving clinical outcomes following CAP."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency. Surgical site infection (SSI) is a major cause of morbidity after appendectomy. Obesity is one of the risk factors for the occurrence of SSI. Subcutaneous fat thickness (SCFT) and Body mass index are markers for obesity. SCFT is easily readable and non-invasive marker and helps to predict the adiposity of the incision site. This study aims to find the association of SCFT with the occurrence of SSI in patients undergoing open appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis. This is a prospective study is patients undergoing emergency open appendectomy. The study was conducted from June 2022 to May 2023. Preoperative SCFT at McBurney's point was measured by ultrasonography in 150 patients and these patients were followed up till 1 month in the post-operative period to watch for the occurrence of SSI. The data was analyzed using EPI-INFO 7 and EZR. Our study included a total of 150 patients. Most of the patients fell in the age group of 20-30 years. The male population was slightly higher than the female. SSI occurred in 24% of the population. Out of these, 21.3% were superficial type and 2.67% were deep type of SSI. The logistic regression of the risk factors showed that SCFT (P-value = 0.001) was significantly associated with SSI. Another risk factor, BMI was also significantly associated with SSI. This study concludes that SCFT is a risk factor for the occurrence of SSI after emergency open appendectomy in patients with uncomplicated appendicitis."

    "abstract": "Acute abdominal pain remains a common cause of emergency presentations, and modern imaging has transformed its evaluation and management. The introduction of ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is generally believed to have improved diagnostic accuracy, reducing unnecessary surgical exploration and enabling safer, more targeted interventions. This review summarizes current evidence on the role of imaging in conditions such as appendicitis, trauma, diverticulitis, and bowel obstruction, highlighting its impact on surgical outcomes and clinical pathways. Key issues include balancing diagnostic speed with concerns over radiation exposure, cost, and potential overuse, particularly in vulnerable populations. Emerging technologies such as low-dose CT, artificial intelligence, and point-of-care imaging are likely to further refine practice, while addressing global disparities in access remains an ongoing challenge. This review uniquely synthesizes recent guideline updates and outcome-based evidence to highlight how modern imaging has redefined surgical decision-making in acute abdominal emergencies."

The primary objective was to assess risk factors for post-operative infections. Other outcomes were death, hospital and ventilator days, and intensive care unit treatment. Significance testing for categorical and continuous data was performed with the chi-squared test and t-test, respectively. Multivariate analysis for binary and continuous outcomes was performed with logistic and linear regression, respectively. Results Two hundred thirty-one patients were included. SSI occurred in 26 (11%) with superficial, deep, and organ space infections documented in six, six, and 14 patients, respectively. Ertapenem was the most common antimicrobial prophylaxis (168, 73%). Antimicrobial prophylaxis without expected activity against anaerobes was given in 46 patients (20%). No antimicrobial prophylaxis was administered in 10 patients (4%). Antimicrobials were administered within 60 minutes prior to the procedure in 150 patients (65%). Patients who received peri-operative antibiotic prophylaxis with any agent had six SSIs (2.9%) versus four SSIs (15.4%) for patients who received no antibiotic prophylaxis of any kind (p=0.017). Patients who received ertapenem prophylaxis had one trauma-related SSI (0.6%) versus four SSIs (6.2%) for patients who received antibiotic prophylaxis with any other agent (p=0.008). On multivariate analysis, the adjusted odds ratio for infection associated with ertapenem prophylaxis versus any other agent was protective at 0.05 (p=0.01). Hospital length of stay (LOS) was 20.3 days for patients who received post-operative antibiotics versus 12.1 days for those who did not receive post-operative antibiotics (p<0.01). Patients who received massive transfusion protocol (MTP) had eight SSIs (22.2%) versus 17 SSIs (8.8%) for those who did not receive MTP (p=0.02). Patients who received post-operative vasopressors had nine SSIs (22%) versus 17 SSIs (9%) for those who did not receive post-operative vasopressors (p=0.02). Patients whose abdominal fascia was left open at the end of the index operation had 21 SSIs (16.4%) versus five SSIs (4.9%) for those whose fascia was closed immediately (p=0.01).  Conclusion Lack of antibiotic prophylaxis, MTP, post-operative vasopressors, and open abdomen predict SSI. Ertapenem was associated with a lower traumatic wound infection rate, but not SSI. Other specific antibiotic agents and timing intervals were not significant. Variables that are surrogates for trauma severity are more accurate predictors of SSI than specific antibiotic agents and timing."

    "abstract": "Hepatic portal venous gas (HPVG) is a serious radiologic indicator that can suggest bowel ischemia and lead to fatal outcomes. The medical field now identifies transient HPVG without ischemia more often because CT technology has spread throughout the healthcare system. We report a 70-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis who developed acute abdominal pain during dialysis. The CT scan results showed HPVG extending into the superior mesenteric venous system. The medical team performed an urgent diagnostic laparoscopy because of ischemia concerns, which showed that the bowel tissue remained healthy without signs of necrosis or perforation. She improved clinically with supportive care, and at 48 hours, a repeat CT showed complete resolution of HPVG. The case illustrates that medical imaging results need to match clinical observations and surgical findings to determine which patients can receive nonsurgical treatment."

    "abstract": "Prostatic Aquablation has emerged as a minimally invasive treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia, recognized in the European guidelines. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety of the procedure in patients treated with this technique at a tertiary care hospital. Complications during hospitalization were evaluated, as well as the reasons for emergency visits and the medium-long-term complications in patients who underwent Aquablation between February 2021 and November 2024. Clinical and laboratory variables were also assessed, along with the type of complication, using the Clavien-Dindo classification system. One hundred and ninety-two patients were operated on with Aquablation in a third-level hospital, between February 2021 and November 2024. Mean age of patients was 68.11 ±11.15 years. Mean prostatic volume was 76.58 ±26.46 ml. During the hospital stay, 30 patients (15.7%) presented some kind of complication. The main complication was haematuria requiring haemostatic resection (7 patients; 23.3%) or evacuation of clots by bladder washings (14 patients, 46.6%). Seven patients required blood transfusions. Two patients (6.66%) presented with acute urinary retention after urinary catheter removal. Additionally, two patients developed urinary tract infection during hospitalization. Two patients presented a rectal perforation. One patient presented a vesical perforation during surgery, and one of them had a false urethral passage. One patient died during hospitalization due to bronchoaspiration in the context of decompensation of multiple myeloma. Out of the total 126 patients who completed at least one year of follow-up, 10.31% (13 patients) required reintervention. Despite being a robotic treatment, Aquablation is not free of serious complications and requires a learning curve. Further studies are needed to properly establish the safety profile of this procedure."

    "abstract": "A previously healthy 12-year-old boy presented to the paediatric emergency department on three occasions in the space of four days with progressive right iliac fossa pain. His presentation appeared consistent with appendicitis; however, blood tests remained normal at each presentation. Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) revealed significant inflammatory changes in the right lower quadrant along with free fluid. Due to worsening pain and advancing findings on POCUS, the patient underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy which identified a normal appendix but had features consistent with omental infarction. Omental infarction is a rare condition that can mimic appendicitis, with few recorded cases in the literature. This is the first documented case of POCUS being utilised in the evaluation of a child with omental infarction. While the patient's diagnosis was less common than initially suspected, POCUS played a crucial role in guiding timely and effective patient care, highlighting its value in clinical decision-making However, there are indications of lower POCUS sensitivity to fluid overload with a full peritoneum."

    "title": "POCUS for Detection of Esophageal and Gastric Foreign Bodies.",
    "abstract": "Foreign body ingestion is a common and challenging complaint for physicians in the emergency department (ED). Although most foreign bodies pass naturally without surgical intervention, about 10-20% require removal based on their size, shape, and location within the gastrointestinal tract. X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans are frequently used for evaluation. However, x-rays cannot detect radiolucent foreign bodies, both modalities emit ionizing radiation, and CT scans are notably expensive. Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) offers a valuable alternative for detecting foreign bodies, as it avoids radiation exposure, reduces costs, and is readily accessible. We present a case series involving three distinct instances of foreign body ingestion, where POCUS enhanced patient outcomes and disposition. This series includes evidence on use of POCUS for an obstructed esophageal foreign body and two gastric foreign bodies in a stable patient and unstable altered patient suspected of medication overdose. POCUS is an effective tool for identifying foreign bodies in the upper gastrointestinal tract, especially when x-rays fail to visualize non-radiopaque materials or when attempting to minimize radiation from CT scans. It allows emergency physicians to quickly confirm the presence and precise location of foreign bodies in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to faster clinical decision making and reduced risk of complications, such as perforation or obstruction."

Current evidence regarding acute aortic syndromes (AAS) following ESD remains limited. A previously healthy, 66-year-old woman presented with half a month history of early esophageal cancer through upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy examination showed: Approximately 21-25 cm away from the incisors, a type II-b lesion on the left posterior wall of the esophagus. Eight days post-hospitalization, she underwent esophageal ESD. Seven hours post-operation, she experienced sudden chest pain. An urgent chest CT scan suggested aortic intramural hematoma(IMH). Following transfer to the vascular surgery department for symptomatic supportive treatment, her condition stabilized, leading to her discharge. Follow-up at three and six months confirmed the aortic condition remained stable. The occurrence of AAS post-ESD is exceedingly rare, with minimal reports in the published literature. This study reviews the major complications associated with ESD and explores the potential link between esophageal ESD and AAS."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of serum calprotectin as a potential biomarker in patients with acute appendicitis and to assess its correlation with clinical and laboratory parameters. A prospective case-control study was conducted over a 1-year period, including 60 consecutive emergency department patients with confirmed acute appendicitis and 30 healthy volunteers. Serum calprotectin levels were measured and compared in both groups. The relationship between calprotectin levels and Alvarado scores, appendix diameter (measured by imaging), and white blood cell (WBC) counts was analyzed using the Pearson correlation test. The mean serum calprotectin level was significantly elevated in patients with acute appendicitis compared to healthy controls (626.2 ± 74.8 pg/mL vs. 40.6 ± 8.0 pg/mL, P < 0.001). No significant correlation was observed between serum calprotectin levels and Alvarado scores (r = -0.202, P = 0.122), appendiceal diameter (r = -0.182, P = 0.164), or WBC count (r = 0.033, P = 0.803). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that serum calprotectin had a high diagnostic performance, with a cutoff value of 41.85 pg/mL yielding 95% sensitivity and 99.96% specificity (AUC: 0.957). Serum calprotectin demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy in differentiating acute appendicitis from healthy controls, suggesting its potential utility as a novel biomarker in clinical practice. Further large-scale studies are warranted to validate its role in distinguishing complicated versus uncomplicated cases and its integration into diagnostic algorithms."

    "abstract": "Isolated hepatic tuberculosis is a rare clinical entity, particularly in immunocompetent patients. It is characterized by frequently silent symptoms and nonspecific radiological abnormalities, which complicates its diagnosis in the absence of specific clinical guidance. We present the case of a 39-year-old man with no significant medical history who was admitted to the emergency department with acute peritonitis resulting from gastric perforation. An exploratory laparotomy confirmed the prepyloric perforation and incidentally revealed the presence of two subcapsular hepatic nodules located in segment II. Histopathological analysis of liver biopsies revealed the presence of epithelioid and giant cell granulomatous inflammation, accompanied by caseous necrosis, strongly suggestive of hepatic tuberculosis. The staging assessment, which included a chest CT scan (showing no pulmonary lesions or mediastinal lymphadenopathy), and abdominal imaging, proved negative, reinforcing the diagnosis of isolated hepatic tuberculosis.The patient was placed on standard anti-tuberculosis treatment, with positive clinical results. This case highlights the importance of considering hepatic tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis of hepatic nodular lesions, even in immunocompetent patients, particularly in endemic areas. It also highlights the crucial importance of histopathological analysis in the diagnostic process and in the rapid adjustment of therapeutic management."

    "abstract": "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) typically manifests as respiratory distress during the neonatal period, and is associated with high mortality rates. However, late-presenting CDH that occurs after the neonatal period is rare and often leads to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment, potentially resulting in severe complications. This study aimed to review our experience with late-presenting CDH cases to better understand its characteristics and facilitate earlier diagnosis and treatment. We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 62 patients aged <18 years who underwent CDH surgery between 2008 and 2024 at Pusan National University Children's Hospital, Korea. Patients in the neonatal period and those with diaphragmatic eventration, hiatal hernias, or morgagni hernias were excluded. We evaluated demographics, symptoms, associated anomalies, surgical findings, and outcomes. Over a 16-year period, seven patients underwent surgery for late-presenting CDH at our center. Among them, 5 were male (71%) and 2 were female (29%). The median patient age at the time of surgery was 9 months. Four patients (57%) presented with respiratory symptoms, including cough and dyspnea, whereas the remaining 3 (43%) exhibited gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting. Diagnosis was achieved in 6 patients (86%) through computed tomography and in 1 patient (14%) through ultrasonography. Three patients with gastrointestinal symptoms due to bowel obstruction or gastric volvulus and 1 patient with respiratory distress caused by lung compression from herniated abdominal organs underwent emergency surgery. Three patients with upper respiratory tract infections underwent surgery after the infections resolved. Primary repair without patch placement was successfully performed in all patients, with a 100% survival rate. Late-presenting CDH can manifest with a wide range of gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms. When children present with unexplained gastrointestinal or respiratory issues, late-presenting CDH should be considered as a differential diagnosis. Although the number of cases is limited, timely diagnosis and appropriate surgical treatment may lead to favorable outcomes."

    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Acute acalculous cholecystitis (AAC) is rare, mostly in older males, with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, critical illness, or systemic infection. Antibiotherapy before or after cholecystectomy is important for preventing septic shock and postoperative infections. Increasing antibiotic resistance was recently noted and can complicate antibiotherapy. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study of all patients who underwent cholecystectomy between 2018 and 2024 in the Clinical Emergency Hospital of Craiova was performed. The etiology of AAC, complications, hospitalization duration, mortality, positive bile cultures, and in vitro antibiotic resistance were analyzed. Results: A total of 802 calculous and 54 AAC were recorded. Patients with AAC were predominantly males (OR = 1.767, p = 0.043) with diabetes (OR = 2.049, p = 0.014) and were older (66.6 ± 13.2 vs. 61.4 ± 15.6, p = 0.014). Mortality was significantly higher in AAC (18.5 vs. 3.6%, OR = 6.058, p < 0.001), with longer hospitalization (mean 9.7 vs. 8.4 days) and more perforation. Positive bile cultures were recorded in 60.5-66.2% of cases, with a similar etiology in both forms of acute cholecystitis (mostly Gram-negative species, Enterococcus, and Staphylococcus); 10 ESBL Escherichia coli and Klebsiella strains, 11 Staphylococcus aureus MRSA, and 1 Enterococcus VRE strain were recorded. Antibiotic susceptibility in vitro was similar in both AAC and calculous cholecystitis. Significant resistance to cephalosporins and quinolones was recorded; the lowest resistance was noted for amikacin, carbapenems, chloramphenicol, colistin (Gram-negative bacteria), and vancomycin. Conclusions: AAC was encountered in older males with diabetes, with a higher rate of complications and in-hospital mortality. Bile cultures were positive in 60.5-66.2%, predominantly with Gram-negative, Enterococcus, and Staphylococcus species. Significant in vitro resistance to cephalosporins and quinolones was found."

    "abstract": "Background/objectives: Strangulated small bowel obstruction (SSBO) is a life-threatening condition that often requires emergency surgery. Identifying preoperative computed tomography (CT) findings indicative of bowel resection may improve diagnostic accuracy and inform surgical decision-making. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed patients diagnosed with SSBO who underwent contrast-enhanced abdominal CT and emergency surgery between January 2022 and April 2024. Patients were divided into two groups according to the surgical outcomes: those who underwent bowel resection and those who did not. CT images were independently reviewed by a radiologist blinded to surgical outcomes, and CT findings were compared between the resection and non-resection groups. Variables significant in the between-group comparisons (p < 0.05) were entered into a multivariable logistic regression to identify indicators for bowel resection. Results: Fifty-two patients were identified, sixteen (30.8%) of whom required bowel resection. The most reliable indicator was absent bowel wall enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT, with a sensitivity of 75.0% and specificity of 86.1%. It was also independently associated with bowel resection [odds ratio (OR) 19.7; 95% confidence interval: 3.43-113.4]. In contrast, ascites, beak sign, and mesenteric edema were commonly observed in both groups and lacked specificity. Of note, bowel resection was avoided in 5 of 17 patients with absent bowel wall enhancement based on intraoperative assessment using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging. Conclusions: Absent bowel wall enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT is an independent preoperative indicator for bowel resection in SSBO."

    "abstract": "Perforation of the piriform sinus is a rare but severe clinical event that can lead to cervico-thoracic mediastinitis, a life-threatening condition requiring urgent multidisciplinary intervention. Among its etiologies, accidental ingestion of foreign bodies, including dental prostheses, is uncommon but poses significant risks due to the anatomical vulnerability of the hypopharyngeal structures. We report a rare case of right piriform sinus perforation secondary to the ingestion of a dental prosthesis, complicated by cervico-mediastinitis, sepsis, tracheostomy, and sacral pressure ulcer. The clinical course required emergency surgical intervention and intensive supportive care. A novel aspect of this case was the use of the Endoscopic Vacuum-Assisted Closure (EVAC) irrigation system as an adjunctive technique in the management of deep cervical drainage. Rather than approaching the fistula from within the lumen, the team created a controlled external drainage system, adaptation of the vacuum-assisted closure therapy directly over the fistulous tract. This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis, high clinical suspicion and coordinated management in the treatment of piriform sinus perforations. It also illustrates the potential applicability of modern technologies such as negative pressure irrigation in the complex management of deep neck infections and mediastinitis."

However, previous studies included relatively small populations (<100 cases) and there is no literature evaluating the prognosis of all causes of feline ascites within the last 20 years. This study aimed to assess the survival times of a large population of cats presenting with ascites and assess the effect of the effusion cause, signalment, clinicopathological and imaging findings on survival. Data was acquired from the medical record system of a referral hospital (including both referrals and first-opinion emergency cases). Four hundred and ninety-eight cats met the inclusion criteria and 55% of all cases survived to discharge. Median survival time post-discharge was 30.5 days. The cause of the effusion was significantly associated with survival to discharge (p = 0.002). Common etiologies of ascites included neoplasia, septic peritonitis, sterile inflammatory disease, uroperitoneum, hemoperitoneum and cardiac disease. Uroperitoneum cases had the highest rate of survival to discharge (77%), while hemoperitoneum cases had the lowest percentage surviving to discharge (40%). Subjectively assessed effusion volume on imaging was significantly associated with survival to discharge (p = 0.012). Subjective assessment of the effusion volume and effusion assessment via abdominocentesis to help obtain a diagnosis can help guide prognosis and are diagnostics that do not require advanced techniques or specialist equipment, which can provide important prognostic information for cats presenting with ascites."

Biocompatibility and toughness are critical properties for the covering membrane of covered stents. The mismatch between covered stents and patient coronary arteries in the clinic restricts the application of covered stents for emergency CAP. The ability to rapidly in situ coating of the stent at the rescue scene has so far been elusive, especially for small-diameter coronary artery covered stents. Here, we investigate a rapid coating technology of covered stents with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)/dibutyl phthalate (DBP) covering membrane for CAP. The highly tough membrane and the short coating timeframe make it possible to prepare the covered stent suitable for patients with emergency CAP. In vitro cell assays demonstrated the excellent biocompatibility of the covering membrane. Moreover, in vivo evaluation in a rabbit model demonstrated successful delivery of the covered stent through the sheath system and effective sealing of vascular perforation."

Gossypibomas, also referred to as retained surgical sponges, are items unintentionally left in the cavities of the body after surgery. These adverse events can lead to secondary surgical procedures, readmissions, and infections. A 24-year-old Somalian male patient presented with persistent coughing, black sputum, and halitosis. His medical history included a laparotomy for a 5-year-old stab wound and penile amputation following a missile injury 15 years back. Physical examination revealed pale conjunctiva, pallor in the oral mucosa, and spoon-shaped fingernails. A chest X-ray demonstrated a ball-like consolidation in the lower left chest, and a thoracic computed tomography scan revealed a soft tissue lesion. The patient underwent thoracotomy and laparotomy, along with a left lower lobe lobectomy due to a bronchopleural fistula caused by a large abdominal surgical sponge invading the lung parenchyma, forming a cavitary lung mass. Diaphragmatic defect was repaired and resection of the gastric perforation using a stapler was performed. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. Gossypibomas should be considered as a potential differential diagnosis in patients presenting with thoracoabdominal soft tissue masses and having a history of prior surgery. This is especially relevant in cases involving gynecological or emergency surgeries, female sex, or individuals with a high body mass index. A detailed medical history and appropriate imaging are essential for timely diagnosis."

There is paucity of data on predictors of morbidity and mortality among elderly surgical patients in Uganda. This study assessed the predictors of morbidity and mortality among elderly patients undergoing emergency exploratory laparotomy at Jinja, Lira, Hoima, and Fort Portal Regional Referral Hospitals. This was a prospective observational cohort in which elderly patients (≥ 65 years) that underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy from 15th November 2024 to 14th February 2025 were enrolled and followed up until 30 days post-operatively to assess for the occurrence morbidity and mortality. The complications assessed included hemorrhage, surgical site infection, deep venous thrombosis, respiratory complications. SPSS version 26 was used for analysis, with Poisson regression done to determine the significant predictors. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Of the 86 participants, 29.1% were above 80 years of age. Majority were male (74.4%). Complications were seen in 25.6% of the participants. The commonest complication was surgical site infection. Mortality occurred in 10.5%. In the multivariable analysis, being older than 80 years, having DM or hypertension and having a perforation were associated with complications; delayed presentation to hospital and blood transfusion associated with mortality (P < 0.05 for all). The rates of morbidity were high. More attention is required among the elderly undergoing surgery in order to reduce the rate at which they get morbidity and mortality with emphasis on wound care. Health education and sensitization in communities should be strengthened, advocating for timely seeking of medical attention by the elderly group."

The aim of this study was to identify risk factors and predictive parameters for NEC requiring surgery and to evaluate associated short-term outcomes. Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective study in preterm neonates diagnosed with NEC admitted to a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) between January 2015 and May 2025. Demographic data, perinatal events, risk factors, clinical signs, imaging findings, and outcomes were analyzed, with a particular focus on surgically managed cases. Descriptive and inferential statistical methods were applied. Results: Forty-four infants met the inclusion criterion. The mean gestational age (GA) was 29.34 ± 4.3 weeks, and the mean birth weight was 1100 ± 563 g. According to Bell's severity index, 45.5% had Bell Stage I, 36.4% Stage II, and 18.2% Stage III. Eleven patients (25%) required surgery. All surgical patients had abdominal distension, and 63.6% had bilious gastric residue. Abdominal X-ray showed pneumoperitoneum in 72.7% and pneumatosis intestinalis in 27.3% of cases. Laboratory abnormalities, including thrombocytopenia, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and hyponatremia (45.5%; 133 ± 6.95 mmol/L), were frequently associated with surgical NEC. A lower GA and birth weight correlated with a higher Bell stage (p = 0.0085 and p = 0.0291). Overall mortality was 29.5% (13/44); surgical mortality was 9.1% (1/11). Conclusions: In this single-center lot, low gestational age and birth weight, abdominal distension with bilious residuals, systemic inflammation, and hyponatremia were frequent among infants who required surgery. Selected infants may benefit from early surgery even without perforation, but inferences are limited by this study's sample size and retrospective design. Prospective multi-center studies are needed to validate predictors and refine surgical timing."

Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted to analyze the clinicopathological data of patients who underwent D2 radical gastrectomy for pathologically confirmed gastric malignancy at the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Shanxi Provincial Cancer Hospital from January, 2013 to December, 2023. Exclusion criteria consisted of: (1) residual gastric cancer or recurrent gastric cancer after surgery; (2) emergency gastric cancer resection due to bleeding, perforation, obstruction, or other causes; (3) comorbidity with other primary malignant tumors; (4) severe preoperative cardiopulmonary insufficiency or hepatic and renal insufficiency who cannot tolerate radical surgery; and (5) inconsistent main diagnosis information across the medical record system, pathological system, and gastric cancer-specific database. Patients were divided into three groups based on treatment methods: the surgery-only group, the perioperative chemotherapy group, and the adjuvant chemotherapy group. Endpoints included: (1) baseline patient characteristics; (2) trends in tumor location and pathological features; (3) evolution of treatment modalities; and (4) survival outcomes. Results: A total of 15,644 patients were included in the analysis, with 12,591 males and 3,053 females, the male-to-female gender ration was approximately 4∶1; the mean age was (61.2±9.5) years. The tumor sites were mainly concentrated in the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) (57.4%), followed by the antrum (25.9%). The incidence of EGJ cancer initially rose and then declined. However, gastric antrum tumors remained stable, and gastric body tumors showed a slow upward trend after 2020, accounting for 16.7%. In terms of pathological types, poorly differentiated carcinoma was the most prevalent, accounting for 55.9%, followed by moderately differentiated carcinoma (24.2%), mucinous adenocarcinoma (or signet ring cell carcinoma,14.1%), neuroendocrine carcinoma (4.8%), and well-differentiated carcinoma (0.9%). The proportion of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma showed a significant upward trend overall as well, peaking at 65.6% in 2022 and decreasing to 57.5% in 2023. Mucinous adenocarcinoma (or signet ring cell carcinoma) exhibited fluctuations with a first increase followed by a decrease: it peaked at 17.3% in 2018, dropped sharply to 8.4% in 2022, and rose back to 13.8% in 2023. The proportions of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, and neuroendocrine tumors remained stable year by year. In terms of pathological staging, the overall proportions of gastric cancer at Stage 0, Stage I, Stage II, Stage III, and Stage IVa were 0.5%, 17.3%, 25.1%, 54.9%, and 2.3%, respectively. For Stage III, its proportion was 74.6% in 2013, which decreased to 46.4% by 2023. Stages I and II gastric cancer showed an upward trend, with their proportions rising from 10.2% and 12.1% in 2013 to nearly 21.0% and 29.6% in 2023, respectively. Between 2013 and 2023, the proportion of patients who received surgery alone continued to decrease, with this proportion dropping to 34.7% in 2023. In contrast, the number of patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy increased year by year, reaching 54.2% in 2023. Since 2017, the application of perioperative chemotherapy has gradually increased, rising to 11.1% in 2023. Immunotherapy showed an almost synchronous growth trend with perioperative chemotherapy. However, targeted therapy exhibited a downward trend after a period of growth. There were 10,704 cases of open surgery (68.4%), 4,744 cases of laparoscopic surgery (30.3%), and 193 cases of transthoracic surgery (1.2%). Pathological margin positivity was observed in 443 cases (2.8%), and the volume of gastric cancer surgeries gradually increased, peaked in 2021 before subsequently decreasing gradually. However, the volume of laparoscopic surgeries did not decrease; instead, it showed an upward trend. The main resection method for EGJ tumors was total gastrectomy, accounting for 78.5% of the total, followed by proximal gastrectomy, which accounted for 21.5%. After total gastrectomy, esophagojejunal Roux-en-Y anastomosis was the primary anastomotic method, and for proximal gastrectomy, the main anastomotic method was esophagogastric anastomosis, which accounted for 68.0% of the total. For distal gastrectomy, Billroth II anastomosis was the most common anastomotic technique, accounting for 92.7% of these procedures. The overall incidence of postoperative complications was 14.5% (2,264/15,644), among which the incidence of severe complications (grades III-IV) was 4.5% (706/15,644). The entire cohort was followed up with for (47.1±36.8) months, and the 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year overall survival rates were 86.4%, 65.9%, and 58.1%, respectively. For patients with stage 0, I, II, III, and IV gastric adenocarcinoma, the 1-year overall survival rates were 95.7%, 98.0%, 89.4%, 81.0%, and 49.1%, respectively; the 3-year overall survival rates were 92.1%, 94.6%, 81.9%, 51.4%, and 14.7%, respectively; and the 5-year overall survival rates were 89.4%, 91.7%, 75.1%, 41.5%, and 10.0%, respectively. For patients with stage I, II, III, and IV gastric neuroendocrine carcinoma, the 1-year overall survival rates were 96.7%, 91.1%, 73.8%, and 52.6%, respectively; the 3-year overall survival rates were 87.2%, 69.6%, 46.1%, and 32.1%, respectively; and the 5-year overall survival rates were 87.2%, 62.2%, 36.7%, and 32.1%, respectively. Conclusions: Gastric cancer in Shanxi Province is characterized by a male predominance, a high prevalence of tumors at the esophagogastric junction, a large proportion of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, and presentation at advanced stages (predominantly Stage III). The detection rate of early gastric cancer has been increasing year by year, the volume of laparoscopic surgeries has been on the rise annually, and the treatment model has shifted from single surgery to comprehensive treatment. 目的： 总结我院（山西省肿瘤医院）11年间行胃癌D2根治术患者的临床病理特征、治疗策略和手术方式演变及生存情况，为本地区胃癌诊疗提供参考。 方法： 本研究采用回顾性观察性研究的方法，回顾性分析山西省肿瘤医院胃肠外科2013年1月至2023年12月期间，接受胃癌D2根治手术、且术后病理证实为胃腺癌或神经内分泌癌患者的临床病理资料。排除标准：（1）残胃癌及胃癌术后复发；（2）因出血、穿孔或梗阻等原因行急诊胃癌切除手术；（3）合并其他原发恶性肿瘤；（4）术前伴有严重心肺功能不全、肝肾功能不全不能耐受根治性手术者；（5）在病案查询系统、病理信息管理系统和胃癌专病数据库中患者主要诊断信息不一致者。根据治疗方式，分为单纯手术组、围手术期化疗组和辅助化疗组。观察指标包括：（1）患者基本情况；（2）肿瘤部位及病理特征演变；（3）治疗策略及手术方式演变；（4）生存情况。 结果： 共计15 644例患者纳入分析，男性12 591例，女性3 053例，男女性别比例约为4∶1；年龄（61.2±9.5）岁。肿瘤部位以食管胃结合部（EGJ）为主，呈先增后降趋势，整体占比57.4%；胃窦部肿瘤呈持平状态，整体占比25.9%；胃体肿瘤2020年后呈现缓慢增长趋势，整体占比16.7%。病理类型以低分化癌最为常见（55.9%），其余依次为中分化腺癌（24.2%）、黏液腺癌或印戒细胞癌（14.1%）、神经内分泌癌（4.8%）和高分化腺癌（0.9%）；低分化腺癌呈先升后降趋势，2022年最高65.6%，2023年降为57.5%；黏液腺癌或印戒细胞癌呈现先升后降再升高的波动趋势，2018年峰值达17.3%，2022年降至8.4%，2023年回升至13.8%；高分化腺癌、中分化腺癌及神经内分泌肿瘤逐年呈持平状态。在病理分期方面，0期、Ⅰ期、Ⅱ期、Ⅲ期及Ⅳa期胃癌整体占比0.5%、17.3%、25.1%、54.9%及2.3%。Ⅲ期胃癌在2013年占比达74.6%，到2023年占比为46.4%，呈现下降趋势。2013年Ⅰ期、Ⅱ期胃癌占比分别为10.2%和12.1%，2023年分别为21.0%和29.6%，呈上升趋势。2013—2023年间，仅接受手术的患者数量持续走低，至2023年该比例降至34.7%；而接受辅助化疗的患者数量逐年上升，至2023年达到54.2%；自2017年起，围手术期化疗的应用占比逐渐增多，至2023年增至11.1%。免疫疗法与围手术期化疗呈现出近乎同步的增长趋势，然而靶向疗法在经历了一段增长期后，又呈现出下降的趋势。手术方式中，经腹开放手术10 704例（68.4%），腹腔镜手术4 744例（30.3%），经胸手术193例（1.2%）。胃癌手术总量逐渐增高，到2021年到达顶峰，随后胃癌手术量逐渐降低，腹腔镜手术并没有减少，反而呈增长趋势。病理切缘阳性443例（2.8%）。手术方式中，食管胃结合部肿瘤切除方式主要为全胃切除（78.5%），其次为近端胃切除（21.5%）。全胃切除术后食管空肠Roux-en-Y吻合是主要吻合方式，近端胃切除术后吻合方式主要是食管管胃吻合（68.0%），远段胃切除术后毕Ⅱ吻合术是主要吻合方式（92.7%）。术后并发症发生率为14.5%（2 264/15 644），其中Ⅲ～Ⅳ级严重并发症发生率为4.5%（706/15 644）。全组随访（47.1±36.8）个月，1、3、5年的总体生存率分别为86.4%、65.9%和58.1%；0期、Ⅰ期、Ⅱ期、Ⅲ期和Ⅳ期胃腺癌患者1年总体生存率分别为95.7%、98.0%、89.4%、81.0%和49.1%，3年总体生存率则分别为92.1%、94.6%、81.9%、51.4%和14.7%，5年总体生存率则分别为89.4%、91.7%、75.1%、41.5%和10.0%；Ⅰ期、Ⅱ期、Ⅲ期、Ⅳ期胃神经内分泌癌患者1年总体生存率分别为96.7%、91.1%和73.8%和52.6%，3年总体生存率则分别为87.2%、69.6%、46.1%和32.1%，5年总体生存率分别为87.2%和62.2%和36.7%和32.1%。 结论： 山西省胃癌发病具有男性多见、好发于食管胃结合部、低分化癌占比高、Ⅲ期病例高发的特点，早期胃癌发现率逐年提高，腹腔镜手术量逐年升高，治疗模式已从单一手术向综合治疗转变。."

    "title": "[Prognostic analysis of local excision following neoadjuvant therapy for rectal cancer: a single-center study].",
    "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the complications, along with their diagnosis and management, that follow local excision for rectal cancer after neoadjuvant therapy. Methods: The clinical data of 53 patients with rectal cancer who underwent local resection after neoadjuvant treatment in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January, 2010 to December, 2024 were retrospectively collected for this descriptive case series study. Indications for local resection were: (1) age ≥ 18 years; (2) American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification I-III; (3) pathologically confirmed rectal adenocarcinoma; (4) distance from the lower edge of the tumor to the anal edge of less than 8 cm; and (5) use of preoperative neoadjuvant therapy. Contraindications of local resection were: (1) multiple primary colorectal cancer and (2) intestinal obstruction, intestinal perforation, or and gastrointestinal bleeding that required emergency surgery. There were 36 males and 17 females, and the median age was 62 (26-85) years. After neoadjuvant therapy, the median distance from the tumor to the anal margin was 4.5 (range, 2.2-6.9) cm. The main outcome measures included: surgical details, pathological findings, postoperative complications, anorectal function, and oncological outcomes (recurrence and survival). Results: Surgical methods included transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) in 47 cases, transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) in 3 cases, and traditional transanal local resection in 3 cases. Of the 53 patients, 29 (54.7%) had pathological complete response (pCR), namely pT0 stage; 8 cases were pT1, 15 cases were pT2, and 1 case was pT3. Twenty-four cases (45.3%) had 33 complications. Clavien-Dindo grade I-II accounted for 97.0% (32/33), including 14 cases (26.4%) of wound dehiscence. Low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) occurred in 7 cases (13.2%), including 5 minor cases and 2 major cases. Postoperative fever occurred in 7 cases (13.2%); urinary retention occurred in 3 cases (5.7%); and diarrhea occurred in 1 case (1.9%). Clavien Dindo grade III was observed in only 3.0% (1/33) of patients, which was a rectovaginal fistula. Among the 14 patients with wound dehiscence, 7 cases only suffered anal pain and were cured after symptomatic analgesic treatment. Five cases suffered anal pain with hematochezia but improved after treatment with essential diet, hemostasis, intravenous antibiotics, pain relief, and sitz bath. Two cases of secondary perianal infection were treated with intravenous antibiotics, local drainage, parenteral nutrition support, and symptomatic treatment, and the wounds healed within 2 months. One patient with rectovaginal fistula underwent transverse colostomy. After six months, the fistula healed and stoma reversal was performed. Seven patients with LARS received anal lifting exercise and defecation reflex training, and anal function recovered to the preoperative level after 1 year. Other complications improved after symptomatic treatment, pain relief, or catheter replacement. The median follow-up time was 60 months. Local recurrence occurred in 4 patients (7.5%) and distant metastasis occurred in 12 patients (22.6%). Seven patients (13.2%) died. The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 75.5%, and the 5-year overall survival rate was 86.8%. Conclusions: Local excision for rectal cancer following neoadjuvant therapy has a high incidence of complications, mainly wound-related, due to the decline of rectal wound healing ability after radiotherapy. However, most of the complications were relieved after symptomatic treatment, and the risk was controllable. 目的： 探讨直肠癌新辅助治疗后局部切除术的并发症及诊治要点。 方法： 采用描述性病例系列研究的方法，回顾性收集2010年1月至2024年12月期间，北京协和医院收治的53例直肠癌经新辅助治疗后行局部切除术的临床资料。局部切除手术适应证：（1）年龄≥18岁；（2）美国麻醉医师协会分级为Ⅰ~Ⅲ级；（3）病理证实为直肠腺癌；（4）肿瘤下缘距肛缘8 cm以内；（5）术前经新辅助治疗。局部切除手术禁忌证：（1）合并多原发结直肠癌；（2）合并肠梗阻、肠穿孔以及消化道出血等需要急诊手术者。全组男性36例，女性17例；中位年龄62（26~85）岁。新辅助治疗后肿瘤距肛缘中位距离4.5（2.2，6.9）cm。主要观察指标包括：手术和病理情况、术后并发症、术后肛门功能情况、术后复发与生存情况。 结果： 手术方式包括经肛门内镜显微手术（TEM）47例，经肛门微创手术（TAMIS）3例，传统经肛门局部切除术3例。29例（54.7%）术后病理结果为pCR，即pT0期；8例为pT1期，15例为pT2期，1例为pT3期。共计24例（45.3%）患者出现33例次并发症，Clavien-Dindo分级Ⅰ~Ⅱ级占97.0%（32/33），其中创面裂开14例（26.4%）；出现低位前切除综合征（LARS）7例（13.2%），包括轻症5例及重症2例；术后发热7例（13.2%）；尿潴留3例（5.7%）；腹泻1例（1.9%）。Clavien-Dindo Ⅲ级仅占3.0%（1/33），为直肠阴道瘘。14例创面裂开患者中，7例仅表现为肛门疼痛，予以对症止痛治疗后痊愈；5例表现为肛门疼痛伴便血，予以要素饮食、止血、静脉抗生素、止痛及坐浴等治疗后好转；2例继发肛周感染予以联合静脉抗生素、局部引流、肠外营养支持及对症治疗后，创面均于2个月内愈合。1例并发直肠阴道瘘患者行横结肠造口术，半年后瘘口愈合，再行造口还纳术。嘱7例出现LARS的患者行提肛锻炼及排便反射训练，1年后肛门功能恢复至术前水平。其余并发症均经对症、止痛或重置尿管后好转。中位随访60个月，4例（7.5%）出现局部复发，12例（22.6%）出现远处转移。7例（13.2%）患者死亡。5年无病生存率为75.5%，5年总体生存率为86.8%。 结论： 直肠癌新辅助治疗后行局部切除术，由于放疗后直肠创面愈合能力下降，因此并发症发生率较高，以创面相关并发症为主，但绝大多数并发症经对症治疗后缓解，风险可控。."

    "title": "[Features of postoperative period in late stages of acute abdominal diseases].",
    "abstract": "To establish the features of postoperative period in late stages of acute abdominal diseases; to identify the informativeness of original method for prediction of postoperative period. There were 92 patients with acute surgical abdominal diseases including 57 (62.0%) patients with acute appendicitis complicated by peritonitis (the first group), 35 (38.0%) - acute intestinal obstruction complicated by peritonitis (the second group). In the first group, 31 (54.4%) patients admitted within 24 hours after manifestation (the first subgroup), 26 (45.6%) - after 24 hours (the second subgroup). In the second group, there were 20 (57.1%) and 15 (42.9%) similar patients, respectively. In early stages after surgery, we assessed some indicators of homeostasis, and some of them were used for prediction (patent No. 2729730). The number of various early postoperative complications significantly correlated with duration of acute abdominal diseases. In patients of the second subgroups (admission after 24 hours), complications occur more often by 37.7% and 66.7%, respectively, compared to the first subgroups (admission before 24 hours) (more often by 41.6% and 57.4%, respectively, according to the Clavien-Dindo classification). Original method was highly effective in predicting the course of urgent abdominal diseases (sensitivity >91.2%, specificity >83.7%). In delayed admission of patients, catabolic processes reach such values (sometimes thresholds) at which compensatory capabilities of the body are not able to fully compensate for them. This condition carried a real risk of postoperative complications. This fact is confirmed by high informativeness of original predictive method based on severity of membrane lesions. Установить особенности течения послеоперационного периода при поздних сроках острых абдоминальных заболеваний; выявить информативность оригинального способа в прогнозировании течения послеоперационного периода. Проведен анализ 92 пациентов с острой хирургической патологией живота, из них 57 (62,0%) больных с острым аппендицитом, осложненным перитонитом (1-я группа), 35 (38,0%) — с острой кишечной непроходимостью, осложненной перитонитом (2-я группа). В 1-й группе 31 (54,4%) пациент поступил до 24 ч от начала заболевания (1-я подгруппа), 26 (45,6%) пациентов — позже 24 ч (2-я подгруппа). Во 2-й группе поступили 20 (57,1%) и 15 (42,9%) больных по подгруппам соответственно. В ранние сроки после операции в динамике оценены ряд показателей гомеостаза, некоторые из которых использованы в способе прогнозирования (патент №2729730). Установлено существенное увеличение количества различных осложнений в раннем послеоперационном периоде в зависимости от продолжительности острых хирургических абдоминальных заболеваний. У пациентов 2-х подгрупп (поступивших позже 24 ч) осложнения возникают чаще соответственно на 37,7% и 66,7%, чем у пациентов 1-х подгрупп (поступивших до 24 ч) (чаще соответственно на 41,6% и 57,4% по классификации Clavien—Dindo). Применение разработанного способа показало его высокую эффективность в прогнозировании течения ургентных заболеваний живота: чувствительность составила более 91%, специфичность — более 83%. При позднем поступлении пациентов выраженность катаболических процессов достигает таких значений (порой пороговых), при которых адаптационные возможности организма не способны их полноценно компенсировать. Такое состояние несло реальную вероятность развития послеоперационных осложнений. Объективность этого подтверждается высокой информативностью оригинального способа прогнозирования, основанного на оценке выраженности мембранопатологических процессов."

    "title": "Richter-Type Spigelian Hernia Presenting With Small Bowel Obstruction: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Spigelian hernia is a rare ventral abdominal wall hernia occurring along the semilunar line (Spigelian fascia), accounting for approximately 1%-2% of all hernias. It often presents with non-specific abdominal pain and carries a high risk of bowel incarceration and strangulation. Because the hernia sac lies beneath muscle, a palpable mass may be absent, making diagnosis challenging without imaging. We report a case of a previously healthy middle-aged man who awoke with sharp right lower quadrant pain. Physical exam revealed localized tenderness and a 2×4 cm mass that was deep, small, and obscured by overlying muscle in the right iliac fossa with audible bowel sounds. Imaging confirmed a right Spigelian hernia containing ileal loops with features of small bowel obstruction. An emergency combined laparoscopic and open hernia repair was performed; the incarcerated bowel was viable and reduced, and a mesh was placed to reinforce the defect. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful with a gradual return of bowel function and no complications. This case underscores the importance of high clinical suspicion and prompt imaging in diagnosing Spigelian hernias. Early surgical intervention in such cases can prevent strangulation and leads to favorable outcomes."

    "abstract": "Patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) are at increased risk for acute pancreatitis, a rare but potentially fatal disease that arises from still poorly understood mechanisms. We report the case of a 60-year-old woman on PD admitted to the emergency room with severe epigastric pain, nausea, and emesis. The patient, suffering from stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) secondary to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, was undergoing treatment for PD-related peritonitis. She presented on day 17 of peritonitis treatment with a cloudy peritoneal effluent and elevated pancreatic enzymes. Exclusion of classical etiologies for pancreatitis was key in ensuring an accurate diagnosis. A thorough anamnesis may identify possible triggers or risk factors involved in the development of this pathology. Peritoneal effluent evaluation is one of the most trustworthy monitoring tools. Knowledge of similar cases is warranted to further understand how we can foresee or even prevent some of these episodes, as well as their complications."

Ltd., Hyderabad, India) for appendiceal stump closure during emergency laparoscopic appendectomy. A prospective clinical study was conducted at Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) Medical College and Hospital, Hyderabad, India, including 70 patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy. Patients were randomly assigned to either the PC or EL group. Data collected included operative time, postoperative pain (measured using the visual analog scale), length of hospital stay, and postoperative complications. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups. The PC group had a significantly shorter hospital stay (3.63 ± 0.77 vs. 4.20 ± 0.93 days; p = 0.007) and shorter operative time (61.46 ± 10.76 vs. 68.03 ± 8.80 minutes; p = 0.006) compared to the EL group. Postoperative pain scores were also significantly lower in the PC group at one, three, six, and 12 hours after surgery (p = 0.001). Although the overall incidence of complications did not differ significantly, abdominal pain and surgical site infections were less frequent in the PC group. PCs are a safe and effective alternative to endoloops for appendiceal stump closure in laparoscopic appendectomy. They offer the advantages of reduced operative time, shorter hospital stays, and lower postoperative pain."

    "title": "Evaluating the Negative Appendicectomy Rate: A Retrospective Observational Cohort Study at a UK Teaching Hospital Trust.",
    "abstract": "Introduction The negative appendicectomy rate (NAR) serves as a key quality indicator in surgical practice, reflecting diagnostic accuracy and decision-making in suspected acute appendicitis. Despite improvements in imaging and clinical scoring systems, NAR in the United Kingdom remains higher than international averages. This study aimed to determine the NAR at East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust (ELHT), compare it with published benchmarks, and evaluate factors influencing diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision-making. Methods A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted at ELHT, encompassing all emergency appendicectomies performed between June 2023 and June 2024. Data were retrieved from electronic patient records and included demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, imaging modality, and histopathology. Negative appendicectomy was defined histologically as the absence of inflammatory changes in the appendix. Subgroup analyses were performed by age, gender, and imaging use. Postoperative complications in negative appendicectomy cases were graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. A clinician survey assessed the utilisation of diagnostic scoring systems. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 31, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Results Of the 320 patients included, negative appendicectomy occurred in 59 cases (18.4%), with the NAR consistent with national data but higher than the international pooled estimate of 13%. Among 214 adults, the NAR was 15.9% (34); while among 106 children, the NAR was 23.6% (25) (p=0.0947). Female patients had a significantly higher NAR of 25.6% (33) compared with males at 13.6% (26) (p=0.0068). Preoperative imaging was performed in 176 cases (55.0%), with 50.8% (30) of negative appendicectomies occurring without imaging. Postoperative complications were observed in 6 negative cases (10.2%), all within Clavien-Dindo grade I-II. Thirty clinician survey responses revealed limited use of validated scoring systems in adult appendicitis, with 20 clinicians (66.7%) relying primarily on clinical intuition and experience. Conclusion The institutional NAR of 18.4% aligns with national figures but remains above international benchmarks. Higher rates among paediatric and female patients highlight persistent diagnostic challenges. Standardising diagnostic pathways through consistent use of validated clinical scoring tools such as the AIR and AAS scores, coupled with appropriate imaging, may enhance diagnostic accuracy, reduce unnecessary surgery, and improve patient outcomes."

    "title": "Management and outcome variability in hernia-related small bowel obstruction: insights from the SnapSBO study.",
    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction (SBO) due to hernia remains a prevalent surgical emergency disproportionately affecting elderly and co-morbid populations. Limited high-quality data exist to guide evidence-informed interventions for hernia-related SBO. This study explored the management and outcomes of hernia-related SBO (hSBO) for patients captured in European Society for Trauma and Emergency Surgery (ESTES) SnapSBO database. SnapSBO is a prospective multicentre time-bound study that accrued consecutive inpatient admissions between November 2023 and May 2024. The present analysis was restricted to patients with abdominal wall hernias. Management pathways were categorized as direct to surgery (DTS), successful non-operative management (NOM), or surgery after trial of NOM (NOM-T). Outcomes of interest included complications, 30-day in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay (LOS), and functional recovery assessed through patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) using the PRO-diGI tool. Among 1737 patients, SBO due to abdominal wall hernia was noted in 386. The median patient age was 73 (range 16-98) years, with 64.8% of patients aged > 65 years. Primary inguinal/abdominal wall hernias were the most common (62.2%). Of the patients, 51.6% were categorized as DTS, where 17.1% required surgery after NOM-T. NOM was successful in 31.2% of patients. Parastomal hernia management led to the highest complication rate (57.1%) and prolonged postoperative LOS (mean(standard deviation) 9.1(4.8) days; P = 0.030) compared with other hernia types. Functional recovery measured in 218 patients was significantly worse in those with parastomal hernia than in those with incisional or primary inguinal hernias (mean(standard deviation) bowel function scores 68.6(22.5) versus 83.6(17.6) and 82.0(20.3), respectively; P = 0.009). There is significant variability in practice and outcomes for hSBO management. Patients with parastomal hernias represent a high-risk subgroup. Future research should focus on PROMs and in developing evidence-based, context-specific guidelines for hSBO management."

    "title": "Minimally invasive management of penetrating thoracic and abdominal injuries: a case series.",
    "abstract": "Penetrating thoracic and abdominal trauma presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in the emergency department (ED). Traditionally managed with open laparotomy or thoracotomy, advances in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) have enabled safe, effective, and rapid diagnosis and intervention. We present a case series of four patients with penetrating gastric, hepatic, and pulmonary injuries successfully managed using MIS, highlighting its role in emergency care. Four hemodynamically stable patients presented to the ED with penetrating abdominal or thoracic trauma: (1) Stab wound to epigastrium: Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed a 1 cm anterior gastric body perforation, repaired laparoscopically. The patient recovered uneventfully and remained asymptomatic at 3-year follow-up. (2) Gunshot to upper abdomen: Laparoscopic wedge resection of a gastric cardia perforation was performed. Recovery was uneventful, with 1-year follow-up showing no complications. (3) Gunshot to right upper abdomen with hepatic injury: Laparoscopic hemostasis and bullet extraction under fluoroscopy were successfully performed. Four-year follow-up was uneventful. (4) Gunshot to left upper chest: Video-assisted thoracoscopic left upper lobe segmentectomy and bullet extraction were carried out. Five-year follow-up revealed preserved pulmonary function and no complications. Early identification and triage in the ED, combined with MIS, enabled rapid diagnosis and definitive treatment while minimizing morbidity. Laparoscopy and thoracoscopy provide excellent visualization, reduce unnecessary open procedures, and shorten hospital stays. MIS is a safe, effective, and feasible approach for selected hemodynamically stable penetrating thoracic and abdominal injuries in the ED. Careful patient selection and surgical expertise are essential for optimizing outcomes."

    "abstract": "Geriatric patients commonly pose a significant challenge, mainly in emergency settings where the time to optimize the high-risk patient with other associated co-morbidities is inadequate, which predisposes these patients to a number of adverse outcomes postoperatively. There is paucity of data on intraoperative findings and predictors for length of hospital stay among elderly surgical patients in Uganda. This study assessed the intraoperative findings and predictors for length of hospital stay among elderly patients undergoing emergency exploratory laparotomy at Jinja, Lira, Hoima, and Fort Portal Regional Referral Hospitals in eastern, northern and western Uganda, respectively. This was a prospective observational cohort in which elderly patients (≥ 65 years) that underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy were enrolled and followed up until time of discharge to assess for the number of days spent in hospital. The intraoperative findings were documented during surgery per study participant. SPSS version 26 was used for analysis, with modified Poisson regression done to determine the significant predictors. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Of the 86 participants, 29.1% were above 80 years of age. Majority were male (74.4%). The most common diagnosis was intestinal obstruction (55.8%) followed by gut perforation (30.2%). Of the 77 that survived, prolonged hospital stay was seen in 35.1%. The median length of hospital stay was 7 days, while the mean was 8.57 days. In the multivariable analysis, American association of anesthesiology class III and having a perforation were associated with prolonged hospital stay (P < 0.05 for all). Over one third of the study participants had a prolonged hospital stay. Optimization of patients should focus on improving the American association of anesthesiology score, in order to create chances of early discharge and reduce cases of prolonged hospital stays."

    "abstract": "Implementing Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol in elective surgeries has improved outcomes. Evidence for a similar role in emergency surgeries must be explored, particularly in patients with peptic perforation. This research aims to study the safety and efficacy of ERAS in patients undergoing surgery for peptic perforation peritonitis. Our study was an open-labeled, randomized, controlled superiority trial conducted on 60 patients of peptic perforation, restricted to first and second category of ASA and distributed equally between the Conventional and ERAS arms. The key interventions in the ERAS arm were intraoperative rectus sheath blockade, encouraging early ambulation, early removal of indwelling catheters and tubes, and early initiation of oral fluid and solid diet. The median length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the ERAS arm (3 vs 5 days). The patients in the ERAS group were free from all the indwelling catheters within 24 h of the surgery. The time to ambulate (21 h vs 48 h) and initiation of unrestricted clear liquids (after 6 h of surgery) was significantly quicker in the ERAS arm. The surgical site infection (10 vs 5) and pneumonia (5 vs 1) rates were higher in the conventional group. This was clinically significant, even though it failed to attain statistical significance. The comprehensive complication index was significantly higher in the conventional arm. In this study, there was 100% compliance with seven out of eight ERAS interventions. The ERAS protocol helped shorten the time needed to attain the preoperative physiological parameters, including bowel functions and reduced the LOHS in patients operated for peptic perforation."

    "title": "Left-Sided Perforated Appendicitis in an Elderly Man with Intestinal Malrotation: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Left-sided acute appendicitis is rare and usually reflects congenital anomalies that misplace the cecum and appendix. Although type I intestinal malrotation (non-rotation) seldom remains undiagnosed into late adulthood, it can complicate diagnosis in older patients, whose comorbidities suggest more common causes of left lower-quadrant pain. CASE REPORT A 67-year-old man with hypertension, mixed dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, and chronic kidney disease had 48 hours of migrating colicky abdominal pain, localizing to the left flank and iliac fossa, with fever and leukocytosis. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a 12-mm inflamed, obstructed appendix in the left abdomen, absence of the retroperitoneal segment of the duodenum, and inversion of the superior mesenteric vessels - findings consistent with type I malrotation. Emergency laparoscopy confirmed a pre-ileal perforated appendix with a localized abscess; laparoscopic appendectomy and drainage were performed with mirrored ports. Histopathology demonstrated transmural necrosis and serositis. Recovery was uneventful; the patient tolerated oral diet on postoperative day 1 and was discharged on day 2 with oral antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS Type I intestinal malrotation may first present as left-sided perforated appendicitis in advanced age. Vigilant review of cross-sectional imaging for malrotation indicators, coupled with early laparoscopic intervention, is essential to prevent diagnostic delay and reduce morbidity in elderly patients with atypical abdominal pain. The rarity of such presentations in the elderly underscores the novelty of this case and the need for heightened clinical suspicion."

    "abstract": "Double omental hernia is an exceptionally rare type of internal herniation, in which small bowel loops pass through two distinct defects in the omentum, usually involving both the gastrocolic and gastrohepatic ligaments. Its clinical presentation is often nonspecific, frequently mimicking other causes of acute abdomen and delaying diagnosis. We report a case of a 71-year-old man with a previous near-total colectomy for familial adenomatous polyposis, admitted with acute abdominal pain and radiologic signs suggestive of pneumoperitoneum. Emergency laparotomy revealed a double omental internal hernia, with small bowel herniation through the gastrocolic and hepatogastric ligaments, resulting in obstruction and bowel perforation. Surgical treatment consisted of hernia reduction, segmental enterectomy, and closure of the omental defects. The patient had an uneventful recovery. This case highlights the importance of recognizing a double omental hernia as a potential cause of acute abdomen, especially in patients with previous abdominal surgery."

Abdominopelvic computed tomography revealed an enlarged appendix, moderate ascites, and peritoneal thickening, findings that could be mistaken for perforated appendicitis with an underlying neoplasm and tumor lysis syndrome. Emergency laparoscopic appendectomy with peritoneal drainage was performed. Histopathology confirmed appendiceal Burkitt's lymphoma. This case illustrates the diagnostic challenge of this rare tumor and highlights the importance of imaging and clinical assessment in early recognition and timely surgical management."

However, life-threatening venous injuries may occur, though they are rarely reported. A 73-year-old man with a prior mitral bioprosthetic valve replacement presented with heart failure due to severe prosthetic stenosis. TMViV was planned via a trans-septal approach. During device advancement through the right iliac vein, a massive venous perforation occurred, resulting in haemorrhagic shock. The cause was likely unrecognized venous calcification. Emergent endovascular repair with covered stents successfully stabilized the patient. This case highlights the risk of catastrophic venous complications during trans-septal TMViV procedures, particularly in patients with venous calcification. Prompt recognition and endovascular intervention can be life-saving in such rare but critical scenarios."

    "title": "Concerning Trends in Acute Care Surgeries Among General Surgery Trainees.",
    "abstract": "Surveys of residents, program directors, and fellowship leaders have raised concerns about general surgery graduates' readiness for independent practice. Evolving practice patterns, particularly the rise of laparoscopic surgery, advanced endoscopy, and interventional radiology, have altered residents' exposure to traditional open procedures. However, the impact of these changes on operative experience in acute care surgery (ACS) has not been well quantified. This study assessed temporal trends in the operative experience of general surgery trainees in the acute care surgery component. We analyzed publicly available ACGME operative case logs for graduating general surgery trainees from 2000 to 2023. Procedures categorized under acute care surgery were identified. Temporal trends were assessed using the Mann-Kendall trend test and visualized with line plots. The average total case volume increased from 903 cases per trainee in 2006 to 1,062 in 2023. Despite the overall increase in case volume, exposure to multiple key ACS operations has declined to critically low levels. Notably, average case numbers per trainee for procedures such as splenectomy, duodenal perforation repair, open common bile duct exploration, choledochoenteric anastomosis, pancreatic abscess drainage, and esophageal perforation repair have fallen to fewer than 1 per trainee. The laparoscopic approach has largely supplanted the open approach across various procedures. Although the total operative volume for general surgery trainees has increased over time, exposure to essential open ACS procedures has markedly declined. This trend raises concerns about the adequacy of operative experience in foundational emergency surgeries and may contribute to ongoing perceptions of insufficient preparedness among graduates."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis band syndrome (ABS) is difficult to diagnose preoperatively due to nonspecific clinical and radiological findings. Most cases are identified during laparotomy performed for presumed small bowel obstruction. Management ranges from simple appendectomy to extensive bowel resection, depending on the viability of the involved segments. Imaging, particularly CT, may show indirect signs such as transition points, but confirmation often requires surgical exploration. We present the case of a 27-year-old woman with no prior medical history, who presented with a two-day obstipation. The CT scan showed bowel obstruction secondary to a terminal ileum stenosis. We performed a laparoscopic exploration during which we found a portion of the small bowel had herniated through a loop formed by an inflamed appendix, and a laparoscopic appendicectomy was successfully performed. The patient showed no complications in the two-week and one-month follow-ups. Given its diagnostic difficulty and potentially severe complications, ABS should be considered in all cases of small bowel obstruction of unknown origin, particularly in patients with no history of prior abdominal surgery. Prompt surgical intervention is critical to reduce morbidity and mortality. Tailoring the surgical approach, laparoscopic or open, based on clinical context, remains essential for optimal outcomes."

The patient was a 74-year-old male with a history of gastric perforation surgery, chemotherapy for neck lymphoma, and hypertension. He presented to the emergency department with an 11-day history of neck pain, one day of limited mouth opening and dysphagia, and eight hours of altered consciousness. On examination, he exhibited impaired consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale score: 8) and cervical rigidity. He was intubated and received oxygen therapy. Laboratory findings revealed elevated infection markers and turbid cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of the CSF detected Streptococcus agalactiae. Enhanced MRI of the head and neck showed a small subdural effusion, spinal cord edema at C5-C6, thickening and enhancement of the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments and meninges at the skull base, suggestive of Streptococcus agalactiae infection. After 10 days of anti-infective treatment with ceftriaxone, the patient's condition improved, and he was transferred to a local hospital for continued management."

Poverty, ignorance, and non-availability of surgical treatment techniques militate against its effective management. A retrospective descriptive study conducted at UNIOSUN Teaching Hospital, Osogbo on patients with CSOM over five years. A total of 428 patients consisting of 232 males and 196 females with age ranged from 1 - 83 years. Children 1-15 years constituted the largest (54.2%) proportion. RCSOM (37.4%), LCSOM (29.9%) and bilateral CSOM (32.7%). Majority (51.4%) had discharge for more than 2 years. Most patients 208 (48.6%) had moderate size perforations and majority (93.5%) were central perforations. Culture results showed pseudomonas 24.3% and staphylococcus aureus 24.3% as the most common organisms isolated. PTA of 152 patients (reviewed) showed that 36.8% had moderate degree of HL and severe degree HL in 26.3%. Ninety four (61.8%) had conductive hearing loss. Hearing loss was significantly associated with the size of perforation (p = 0.001) and duration of ear discharge (p = 0.022). About 99% of patients were managed conservatively with topical ear drops/ dressing with wick gauze impregnated with ciprofloxacin ear drops. Five patients (1.17 %) had tympanoplasty, six (1.40%) had cortical mastoidectomy and 2 (0.47%) patients died secondary to intracranial complications. Challenges militating against effective management of CSOM in Nigeria include poverty, delayed presentation, few tympanomastoid surgical experts and poor attitude toward surgical procedures. Public enlightenment including early presentation of patients, provision of adequate equipment and focused attention on appropriate surgical techniques should be embarked upon urgently.

La plupart des patients 208 (48,6 %) présentaient des perforations de taille modérée et la majorité (93,5 %) étaient des perforations centrales. Les résultats de culture ont montré que les pseudomonas (24,3 %) et le staphylococcus aureus (24,3 %) étaient les organismes les plus couramment isolés. L'ATA de 152 patients (révisés) a montré que 36,8 % avaient un degré modéré de perte auditive et un degré sévère de perte auditive chez 26,3 %. La perte auditive était significativement liée à la taille de la perforation (p = 0,001) et à la durée des écoulements auriculaires (p = 0,022). Environ 99 % des patients ont été traités de manière conservatrice avec des gouttes auriculaires topiques/dressing avec de la gaze à fil imbibée de gouttes auriculaires de ciprofloxacine (antibiotique). .

Delayed perforation beyond several days is extremely rare. A 65-year-old man underwent colonoscopic removal of a 6-mm sessile tubular adenoma in the descending colon using a hot snare. Six hours later, he developed abdominal pain with computed tomography findings consistent with post-polypectomy electrocoagulation syndrome and improved after conservative management. Fifty-four days later, he re-presented with severe abdominal pain; computed tomography revealed free intraperitoneal air and colonic necrosis. Emergency subtotal colectomy confirmed PPP. The patient recovered well and remained asymptomatic at 6-month follow-up. This case highlights that PPP can occur several weeks after polypectomy and may initially mimic post-polypectomy electrocoagulation syndrome.

Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index (SII) is a biomarker reflecting immune status and inflammatory response, but its role in acute appendicitis remains poorly characterized. This study aims to investigate the potential diagnostic and therapeutic value of SII for assessing infection severity and prognosis in acute appendicitis. This retrospective study analyzed clinical data from patients with acute appendicitis admitted to our hospital. The SII was the primary exposure variable and calculated as SII = platelet count × neutrophil count /lymphocyte count. Outcome variables included length of stay and total hospitalization costs. Covariates included age, sex, admission time, body temperature, shock status, comorbidities, hemoglobin, procalcitonin, presence of fecalith on computed tomography (CT), placement of intraoperative drainage tubes, and postoperative pathological classification. The study included 2,458 patients with acute appendicitis. Surgically treated patients had significantly higher SII than conservatively managed patients (2077.76 vs. 1526.80). SII was positively correlated with the pathological severity of acute appendicitis (p < 0.001). Patients with gangrenous appendicitis had a significantly higher SII values [median 2452.10 (IQR 1486.70-3920.70)] than those with simple inflamed appendicitis [median 1026.14 (IQR 505.86-1501.76)]. Moreover, SII was significantly associated with intraoperative drainage tube placement (p = 0.002); patients in the drainage tube group had higher SII values [median 2263.32 (IQR 1326.86-3682.69)] than those in the non-drainage tube group [median 1977.62 (IQR 1121.81-3409.83)].

    "abstract": "This case report details the atypical presentation and management of a 65-year-old male with a medical history encompassing hypertension, hepatitis C, and alcohol abuse (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score: 6). The patient presented to the emergency department with chest and lower abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Initial imaging, including a contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiogram (CTA), revealed a distended gallbladder, perihepatic fluid, and an intraluminal blush arising from the right cystic artery. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed, revealing a substantial perihepatic blood collection and a ruptured gallbladder with a posteriorly positioned cystic artery that was seen entering the gallbladder lumen through the posterior wall. Bleeding was observed filling into the gallbladder. Owing to significant adhesions and gallbladder friability, a subtotal cholecystectomy was undertaken, with clips applied and electrocautery employed for hemostasis. The cystic artery was clipped at its takeoff and subsequently cauterized. Postoperatively, minimal serosanguineous drainage was observed, and pathological examination of the gallbladder confirmed a benign nature. The case discussion addresses the rarity of gallbladder perforation, especially in the context of acute cholecystitis, and introduces a unique scenario of an abnormally positioned cystic artery causing a pseudoaneurysm, a novel phenomenon not previously documented. The critical presentation precluded cystic artery embolization, necessitating a tailored approach with a subtotal cholecystectomy. This case contributes valuable insights into the understanding and management of complex gallbladder pathologies, emphasizing the importance of adapting surgical strategies to address multifaceted anatomical and clinical considerations."

The primary concern about antibiotic therapy is the need for appendectomy due to recurrent acute appendicitis after treatment. The optimal antibiotic choice, route of administration, and duration of treatment remain controversial. We aimed to demonstrate the long-term success of oral antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated appendicitis. This was a single-center retrospective study including all patients diagnosed with uncomplicated acute appendicitis between January 2020 and December 2022, who were discharged from the emergency department on oral antibiotics without hospitalization. Treatment success was defined as the absence of appendectomy during follow-up. We reported long-term treatment success rates of oral antibiotic therapy. In addition, factors that may affect treatment success were evaluated. A total of 99 patients were included in the study. At 1 year, the treatment success rate was 76% (95% CI = 66-83%). At a median follow-up of 34 months, 70% (95% CI = 60-78%) remained free of surgery. The Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that 80% of appendectomies due to recurrent acute appendicitis occurred within the first 10 months. There were no significant differences between patients who required appendectomy and those who did not regarding age, sex, WBC count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, appendix diameter, or previous intravenous antibiotic use. With a median follow-up of 34 months, oral antibiotic-only treatment prevented appendectomy in 70% of patients.

MRI findings included engorged tortuous vascularity, multiple dark intraplacental T2 bands, multiple uterine bulging, and loss of the normal hypointense T2 uterine lining. Moderate hemoperitoneum was also identified. Emergency surgery confirmed placenta percreta with active extravasation, hemoperitoneum of approximately two litres, and bladder adhesions. Hysterectomy was performed, with bladder repair, and the patient recovered uneventfully. This case highlights the critical role of MRI in diagnosing placenta accreta spectrum (PAS), even when performed for unrelated indications.

RF energy (30-40 W, ≤90 s) at the LV anterior wall markedly suppressed ectopy, followed by abrupt chest discomfort and hypotension. Fluoroscopy suggested pericardial effusion; emergent pericardiocentesis yielded 150 ml of bright red, arterialized blood with rapid hemodynamic recovery. Biventricular angiography showed no contrast extravasation, and serial echocardiography confirmed no recurrent effusion.

    "abstract": "Choanal atresia (CA) is a congenital condition characterized by occlusion of the nasal airway due to failure of recanalization during embryological development. It is more commonly unilateral and typically presents during infancy. In contrast, bilateral CA is a neonatal emergency that often manifests as respiratory distress at birth. The presentation of bilateral CA in late adulthood is extremely rare. This case presents an unusual case of an elderly patient diagnosed with bilateral CA at 65 years. She presented with a primary complaint of lifelong bilateral nasal obstruction and denied any symptoms suggestive of chronic rhinosinusitis. Examination revealed bilateral choanal obstruction with no visible openings in the nasal cavity. The patient underwent endoscopic transseptal repair of bilateral CA, which included perforation of the atretic plate, posterior septectomy, and flap reconstruction. Postoperative evaluation demonstrated bilaterally patent choanae, and the patient remained asymptomatic, with no further complications. This case highlights a rare presentation of bilateral CA diagnosed in late adulthood. Although typically detected in the neonatal period, bilateral CA can occasionally remain undiagnosed for decades. This patient represents the oldest reported case of bilateral CA in the literature, emphasizing the variability in clinical presentation and the potential for delayed diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis (AA) is a frequent indication for emergency surgery in children; accurate diagnosis is essential to prevent complications. We examined whether serum Galectin-3 is associated with pediatric AA and quantified its diagnostic performance relative to routine inflammatory markers. This prospective, single-center study was conducted in a tertiary emergency department between July 1, 2023, and January 31, 2024. Children younger than 18 years with pathologically confirmed AA were enrolled as cases; age-compatible healthy volunteers served as controls. Venous blood was obtained at presentation before any therapeutic intervention. Galectin-3 concentrations were quantified using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The primary endpoint was the ability of Galectin-3 to discriminate AA from controls. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to assess discrimination, yielding area under the curve estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs); sensitivity and specificity were quantified at prespecified thresholds. Seventy-four children were analyzed (AA group n = 47; control group n = 27). Compared with controls, the AA group had higher Galectin-3, leukocyte and neutrophil counts, C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and lower lymphocyte counts and platelet-to-neutrophil ratio (PNR) (all p < 0.05). Galectin-3 yielded an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.680 (95% CI, 0.55-0.81). At a threshold of >130.71 pg/mL, sensitivity was 91.49% and specificity was 33.33%; at >115.71 pg/mL, sensitivity was 100.00% with the same specificity; at >254.90 pg/mL, specificity was 92.30% with sensitivity 29.79%. Serum Galectin-3 is elevated in pediatric AA and affords moderate discrimination. Owing to limited specificity at pragmatic cut-offs, Galectin-3 alone is insufficient as a standalone test; however, it may serve as a rule-out adjunct within multimodal pathways. External validation in larger, multicenter cohorts is warranted."

    "abstract": "The appendix is a small, worm-like diverticulum of the caecum, potentially having a role in regulating intestinal microbiota and immunology. Inflammation of the appendix, acute appendicitis, is one of the most common reasons for acute abdominal pain in children and adults and surgical emergency visits worldwide. The pathophysiology of appendicitis is still poorly understood. During the past decade, evidence has overturned the long-lasting dogma that all appendicitis cases have a clinical course inevitably progressing to perforation and life-threatening peritonitis unless operated upon in a timely manner. Instead, this natural course occurs only in a smaller proportion of patients, for whom emergency appendectomy remains mandatory. Advances in diagnostic accuracy following utilization of clinical scoring systems and imaging has enabled more accurate pre-interventional assessment of appendicitis disease severity. While some patients still require urgent surgery, the majority can be treated successfully with antibiotics, and in some the disease has even been shown to resolve spontaneously. This has confirmed the notion of at least two different forms of appendicitis: non-perforating and perforating, often referred to as uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis. Unified definitions of these forms are still undergoing rigorous research and debate, hampering both comparison of different studies and the establishment of unified treatment guidelines. The current knowledge on the safe and effective outcomes of non-operative treatment alternatives has further underlined the need for standardized uniform definitions of appendicitis severity and assessment of the success of two fundamentally different treatment options."

    "title": "Accuracy of Computed Tomography in Identifying the Etiology of Small Bowel Obstructions in Virgin Abdomens at a Tertiary Care Military Treatment Facility.",
    "abstract": "IntroductionSmall bowel obstructions (SBO) account for up to 50% of emergent laparotomies. Computed tomography (CT) aids in diagnosing SBO by identifying transition points and potential etiologies, though accuracy varies. SBO in a virgin abdomen (SBO-VA) presents unique diagnostic challenges. This study assesses CT accuracy in identifying SBO-VA etiologies in patients at a tertiary military treatment facility to help guide future management strategies.MethodsThis retrospective study reviewed SBO-VA cases from 2005-2021 with IRB approval. Patients were identified via ICD codes and included if ≥ 18 years with CT-confirmed SBO and no prior abdominal surgery. Demographics, imaging, and surgical findings were collected. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of CT in identifying intraoperative etiologies were calculated.ResultsOf 80 patients with SBO and no prior abdominal surgery, 37 underwent operative management and were included in the final analysis. CT imaging showed 100% sensitivity for confirming obstruction and localizing a transition point. Diagnostic accuracy varied by etiology: sensitivity was highest for foreign bodies (100%). Strictures had a high sensitivity as well (80%), with a PPV (1.0) and specificity (100%) for foreign body, mass, and strictures. Among 17 non-operatively managed patients, adhesive disease was the most commonly presumed cause (56%), followed by partial obstruction or ileus (25%) with malignancy suspected in 2 (12%).ConclusionCT reliably identifies SBO and transition points but has variable accuracy in determining specific etiologies, underscoring the need for clinical judgment in nonoperative vs operative management in patients with SBO-VA."

Acute appendicitis within the sac is rarer still, occurring in only 0.1% of cases. We describe a male patient presenting with an incarcerated right inguinal hernia, who developed diffuse peritonitis after manual reduction. Laparotomy revealed gangrenous perforated appendicitis with purulent peritonitis. Appendectomy, partial omentectomy, and peritoneal lavage were performed. The patient recovered uneventfully. Amyand's hernia complicated by perforated appendicitis is an exceptional surgical emergency. Early recognition and prompt surgical management are crucial for favorable outcomes."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a leading cause of surgical emergencies in children, with ultrasound (US) emerging as a preferred diagnostic tool due to its lack of radiation and cost-effectiveness. However, the accuracy of US is highly operator-dependent and may vary between general referring emergency departments (EDs) and specialized pediatric EDs. To compare the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of US performed at referring EDs vs. a pediatric ED in identifying acute appendicitis. A retrospective study analyzed pediatric patients aged <18 years who underwent US at referring EDs and were transferred to a pediatric ED for repeat imaging between July 2018 and July 2023. Data collected included US findings, surgical pathology, white blood cell count, and patient disposition. Sensitivities of the US were calculated and compared between settings. Among 64 children included, the US at the pediatric ED demonstrated higher sensitivity (85.2%) compared to referring EDs (51.9%) (p = 0.018). Pediatric ED US resulted in fewer non-visualized appendices (a 34.4% reduction) and equivocal findings (a 30.5% reduction). Patients with positive surgical pathology exhibited higher white blood cell counts (mean 17.1) and neutrophil percentages (mean 81.0%). False positive rates were low (6.9%), aligning with published benchmarks. US performed at pediatric EDs exhibited superior diagnostic accuracy for appendicitis compared to referring EDs, likely due to operator expertise and enhanced imaging protocols. Efforts to standardize training and improve resources at referring EDs may reduce diagnostic disparities and unnecessary interventions."

    "abstract": "Background: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can lead to zinc deficiency, which plays a critical role in immune function and tissue repair. This study aims to determine the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and impact of zinc deficiency in IBD patients. Methods: This is a retrospective study of patients aged ≥14 years with confirmed IBD and available zinc level measurement. Zinc deficiency was defined as a level <10.6 µmol/L. Primary outcomes included the prevalence of zinc deficiency and the characterization of the clinical profile of patients with zinc deficiency. Secondary outcomes included IBD-related hospitalizations, emergency room visits, surgeries, and complications (anemia, small bowel obstruction, new perianal disease, intra-abdominal abscess). Results: Among 447 patients (54.4% male; 79.2% Crohn's disease) with a median age of 29 years (IQR: 22-38), 45.6% had zinc deficiency (83.8% Crohn's disease). Zinc-deficient patients had higher C-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin (both p < 0.001) levels, and were more likely to be on corticosteroids (p = 0.04). Zinc deficiency was associated with higher rates of IBD-related hospitalizations (48.0% vs. 17.7%), surgeries (19.6% vs. 5.8%), complications (30.4% vs. 12.4%), and emergency room visits (40.2% vs. 17.3%) (all p < 0.001). Upon multivariate analysis, predictors of IBD-related hospitalization were zinc deficiency (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.07-5.48, p = 0.03) and low albumin (OR 9.03, 95% CI 3.38-24.15, p < 0.001). Zinc deficiency was associated with IBD-related surgeries (OR 5.23, 95% CI 1.27-21.45, p = 0.02) and complications (OR 3.98, 95% CI 1.52-10.41, p = 0.005). Conclusions: Zinc deficiency is prevalent in patients with IBD, associated with a high inflammatory burden, and was linked to worse clinical outcomes after controlling for markers of inflammation."

    "title": "Four-class classification of tumor-induced colorectal obstruction histopathology: A ResNet-mamba-mased study on cellular interaction pattern recognition.",
    "abstract": "This study aimed to develop a deep learning model to recognize cell interaction patterns in pathological slides of malignant bowel obstruction. The model classifies lesions into four categories-normal mucosa, serrated lesions, adenomas, and adenocarcinomas-and evaluates its diagnostic utility in tumor-associated obstruction. Pathological slides from patients with tumor-induced intestinal obstruction (TICO) were retrospectively collected from First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical University and annotated into four histological categories: normal, serrated lesions, adenomas, and adenocarcinomas. The proposed deep learning framework combines a residual convolutional network with a bidirectional state-space module (SSM), enabling multiscale feature extraction through convolution and down-sampling, while modeling the spatiotemporal dynamics of cellular interactions. The model was designed to learn spatial and structural characteristics of cell interactions-such as glandular organization, intercellular spacing, and nuclear density-across different lesion types. Grad-CAM was used to visualize attention regions and assess consistency between model focus and pathological features. However, Grad-CAM was used solely for interpretability and not clinical validation; no expert verification of the visualizations has been performed. On an independent Chaoyang test set, the model achieved a validation accuracy of 85% and a macro-F1 score of 0.843 (95% CI: 0.829-0.857), showing only a 3% decline from training accuracy (88%), thus demonstrating strong generalizability. In addition, we calculated 95% confidence intervals using 1,000 bootstrap resamples and applied both the DeLong test and McNemar test to compare the performance of our model with baseline methods. The results demonstrated statistically significant improvements (P < 0.05) in Accuracy, Macro-F1, and ROC-AUC, thereby further strengthening the reliability of our conclusions. The recall for adenocarcinoma (Class 3) reached 88%, while Classes 0-2 (normal, serrated lesions, and adenomas) ranged from 78% to 83%. These results highlight the impact of sample imbalance and morphological similarity, which will be addressed in future work through Focal Loss reweighting and detailed error analysis. Grad-CAM visualizations identified regions of glandular disruption and abnormal nuclear density, aligning with WHO-2022 diagnostic criteria and enhancing model interpretability. Overall performance is comparable to state-of-the-art gastrointestinal pathology AI systems from recent years, offering rapid and quantitative diagnostic support in emergency pathology settings. The proposed deep learning model effectively distinguishes four categories of tumor-associated colorectal lesions, demonstrating strong diagnostic potential. Limitations include: (i) all data were retrospectively collected from a single center, without external multicenter validation. Differences in population composition, scanning platforms, and staining batches may affect the model's external generalizability; future studies will prioritize the inclusion of multicenter datasets to systematically evaluate the robustness and applicability of the model under diverse clinical conditions; (ii) the model has so far been assessed only in an offline environment, lacking prospective clinical validation within real-world workflows. Nonetheless, this model provides an important foundation for the early diagnosis of TICO, the formulation of personalized treatment strategies, and the advancement of pathological image analysis technologies."

    "title": "Can the Combination of White Blood Cell Count and C-Reactive Protein Rule Out Pediatric Appendicitis, a Retrospective Analysis?",
    "abstract": "Pediatric appendicitis (PA) is the most frequent cause of pediatric emergency surgery. Standard PA scoring systems incorporate inflammatory biomarkers (white blood cell count [WBC] or C-reactive protein [CRP]); however, the individual biomarker sensitivities have not been reported beyond single-center sites. We aimed to measure the individual and combined sensitivities of WBC and CRP to rule out PA in a large multicenter hospital system. We did a retrospective study of pediatric emergency department patients (age <18) with abdominal pain, using a deidentified electronic health database from a 175-hospital system in the United States, comparing PA versus non-PA patients. Pediatric appendicitis patients were identified by ICD-10 diagnosis codes and had advanced imaging, whereas non-PA patients had advanced imaging and were discharged home with the ICD-10 code for abdominal pain. Using matched propensity matching, we calculated receiver operator characteristics and Youden's index to find the optimal cutpoints. Sensitivity was calculated at the optimal and traditional cutpoints for each biomarker, also combined in parallel fashion. We identified 7414 subjects (3707 PA matched to 3707 controls). The WBC in PA patients was 14.99 ± 5.00 k/mm3 versus 9.63 ± 3.83 k/mm3 in non-PA patients (P < .001). The CRP in PA patients was 5.13 ± 6.43 mg/dL versus 1.22 ± 2.17 mg/dL in controls (P < .001). The optimal cutpoints (Youden's index) were 11.5 k/mm3 for WBC and 1.11 mg/dL for CRP. The sensitivity of WBC to rule out PA varied between 75.6%-83.9%, depending on the cutpoint (10.0-11.5 K/mm3). Similarly, the sensitivity of CRP to rule out PA varied from 64.9%-66.7%, depending on the cutpoint (1.0-1.11 mg/dL). Combined analysis showed that low WBC and CRP had a sensitivity of 90.0%-93.0%, yielding a negative predictive value of 99.2%-99.4% to rule out PA. The PA patients in our study had significantly higher inflammatory biomarkers than the non-PA patients. Combining WBC less than 10.0 k/mm3 and CRP less than 1.0 mg/dL was 93.0% sensitive to rule out PA. Researchers should consider this combination of biomarkers to rule out PA in future prospective studies."

    "abstract": "Secondary peritonitis caused by gastrointestinal perforation is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Effective management includes surgical source control, antibiotic therapy, and intensive resuscitation. The choice between primary abdominal closure (PAC) and vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) in the management of secondary peritonitis remains a subject of debate. This Danish nationwide register-based cohort study included patients undergoing emergency surgery for secondary peritonitis from perforation of the small intestine, colon, or rectum between 2007 and 2021 who were treated with either PAC or VAC. Data were extracted from national registries, including the Danish Register of Cause of Death and the Danish National Patient Registry. The primary outcome was overall all-cause mortality; secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality at 30 days, 90 days, and 1 year. In all, 13 898 patients were included (1017 in the VAC group, 12 881 in the PAC group). VAC-treated patients had significantly higher Charlson Co-morbidity Index scores and were slightly younger. In the subgroup with available laboratory data, VAC-treated patients also presented with more severe biochemical derangements, including elevated C-reactive protein, leukocytes, bilirubin, and lactate, as well as lower haemoglobin, suggesting a higher baseline severity of illness. The overall risk-stratified mortality rate (RSMR) was 49.1% for VAC and 52.0% for PAC (P = 0.222). The 30-day mortality rate was 16.9% in both the VAC and PAC groups, with RSMR of 17.4% and 18.3%, respectively (P = 0.656). At 90 days, mortality was 24.3% and 22.5% in the VAC and PAC groups, respectively, with a corresponding RSMR of 23.2% and 24.2% (P = 0.437). One year after surgery, the mortality rate was 31.3% for VAC and 29.5% for PAC, with a corresponding RSMR of 30.3% and 31.6% (P = 0.346). This nationwide cohort study revealed no significant differences in mortality between PAC and VAC in patients with secondary peritonitis at any of the designated time points. Demographic and laboratory data suggest that VAC-treated patients had a higher baseline severity of illness."

    "title": "Grade V AAST Intestinal Vascular Injury Secondary to Blunt Abdominal Trauma: A Case Report From a University Hospital in Saltillo, Mexico.",
    "abstract": "A 65-year-old male with no relevant medical history presented to the emergency department with generalized abdominal pain following blunt trauma caused by a bicycle handlebar impact to the mesogastrium 48 hours prior. The patient initially self-medicated with analgesics without improvement. Upon evaluation, he had stable vital signs, epigastric ecchymosis, decreased peristalsis, and signs of generalized peritonism. Laboratory results showed leukocytosis (17.6 x 109/L). Plain abdominal radiographs showed intestinal loops with diameters within normal limits and a few short air-fluid levels in the left hypochondrium. Notably, the distribution of intraluminal gas in that region revealed a \"string of pearls\" sign, raising suspicion for an obstructive process. An abdominal CT scan revealed inflammatory pelvic changes, mesenteric fat stranding, dilated ileal loops, and free fluid in the pelvic cavity. Exploratory laparotomy showed 150 mL of serosanguineous fluid, a mesenteric border hematoma of the ileum 100 cm from the ileocecal valve, a phlegmon with adhesions, and a 12.5 cm devascularized segment of ileum (bucket handle injury) with necrosis located 120 cm from the ileocecal valve, classified as AAST (American Association for the Surgery of Trauma) Grade V injury and signs of acute appendicitis (erythema and fibrinopurulent coating). Resection with end-to-end anastomosis and appendectomy was performed. The patient tolerated oral intake by postoperative day 2 and was discharged with outpatient follow-up. Histopathology confirmed intestinal necrosis with regional peritonitis and periappendicitis. In patients with blunt abdominal trauma, the most frequently affected organs are the spleen, liver, and small intestine. Injuries to these organs can be missed when the trauma mechanism is underestimated; therefore, frequent physical re-evaluation is essential, as a single examination does not completely exclude the presence of injury."

We report the case of a 29-year-old female psychiatric hospital resident with a history of schizoaffective disorder who developed a toxic megacolon while on clozapine therapy. The patient presented with 24 hours of delirium, altered mental status, and a distended, painful abdomen. Despite stabilization efforts, her condition rapidly deteriorated. Emergent decompressive laparotomy revealed a massively dilated colon with solid stool. Postoperatively, she developed abdominal compartment syndrome and underwent a total colectomy for colonic necrosis. Multiple organ failures, including small bowel obstruction, pulmonary emboli, and septic shock, further complicated her clinical course. Despite maximal ICU-level care, she did not survive her condition.

    "abstract": "Foreign body ingestion (FBI) is common among children, with coins being the most frequently ingested object. Nevertheless, radiographic differentiation can become difficult when two juxtaposed coins resemble the contour of a button battery (BB). This paper describes an 8-year-old boy who presented with drooling, vomiting, and absolute dysphagia. Chest radiographs revealed a radiopaque object in the upper esophagus with a double-rim or \"halo\" sign, raising concern for a BB. Due to the patient's symptoms and radiologic uncertainty, we performed urgent esophagoscopy under general anesthesia. Intraoperative findings revealed two stacked coins lodged in the upper esophagus. The surrounding esophageal mucosa displayed circumferential necrosis and eschar formation, although no perforation was present. Postoperative computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed as a precaution and confirmed no vascular injury. We managed the patient conservatively where he then was discharged after 2 weeks in stable condition. Upon follow-up imaging, there were no complications, and we confirmed mucosal healing. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge posed by stacked coins, which may radiographically mimic BB. Although inert, stacked coins can still cause significant esophageal injury, particularly when impacted for an unknown duration. In symptomatic cases, urgent intervention remains essential regardless of object type. Lateral imaging and careful interpretation can help avoid unnecessary alarm or delayed management in similar scenarios."

    "abstract": "Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a rare form of malignant tumor affecting the small intestine, specifically the jejunum. It can cause intussusception, a condition wherein one segment of the intestine telescopes into another, leading to obstruction, ischemia, and necrosis. Small intestinal intussusception in adults is a rare clinical condition. The majority of affected individuals have pathological factors, such as tumors, polyps, diverticula, inflammation, or intestinal adhesions. Abdominal pain and bowel obstruction are the most common symptoms, but small bowel tumors are often not visible on endoscopy, making additional imaging essential for accurate diagnosis. Herein, we report the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of jejunal LMS-induced intussusception in an adult patient. A 56-year-old female was first admitted to our hospital in June 2024 due to intermittent abdominal distension and pain with paroxysmal exacerbation, and her abdominal pain lasted for more than 10 days. There was no hematemesis or melena. Initial computed tomography (CT) scans showed no abnormalities, but subsequent imaging revealed a left mid-abdominal jejuno-jejunal intussusception. The histopathological and immunostaining findings indicated jejunal LMS without metastasis, and emergency laparotomy revealed an intestinal tumor at the intussusception site. The tumor was surgically resected, and postoperative follow-up is underway. To date, the patient remains well but has declined further recommended testing and therapy. This case underscores the uncommon clinical presentation of LMS-induced intestinal intussusception in adults. Timely diagnosis and intervention are critical for improving survival outcomes in patients with LMS. Surgical resection remains the treatment of choice for eligible candidates."

    "abstract": "Esophageal foreign body impaction represents a common clinical emergency. In severe cases, it can lead to esophageal perforation and aortic injury, potentially causing life-threatening aorto-esophageal fistulas. While immediate intervention is critical, concurrent infection and retained foreign material substantially complicate management. We report a rare case of a giant aortic arch pseudoaneurysm secondary to a migratory fish bone. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) confirmed the diagnosis, prompting urgent surgery. Median sternotomy under cardiopulmonary bypass enabled simultaneous foreign body extraction and aortic perforation repair using autologous pericardium. We reconstructed the aortic arch using a branched stent-graft system via the frozen elephant trunk (FET) technique. Postoperatively, systematic mediastinal irrigation, proactive gastrointestinal decompression, and protocolized enteral nutritional support facilitated complete recovery without requiring secondary esophageal reconstruction. Aortic injuries resulting from esophageal foreign bodies frequently necessitate a multidisciplinary approach. This case demonstrates the feasibility of a single-stage surgical strategy combining aortic repair via the frozen elephant trunk technique with conservative, non-operative management of the concomitant esophageal injury, facilitated by rigorous postoperative care. Treatment strategies must be individualized based on a comprehensive assessment of the aortic involvement pattern, anatomical location, and coexisting pathological conditions."

    "abstract": "Abdominal ultrasound (AUS) is increasingly utilized as a diagnostic adjunct in neonates undergoing evaluation for intestinal injuries such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP), volvulus, and intestinal obstruction, which need urgent surgical evaluation and often emergent intervention. However, the interpretability of AUS-defined as the number of explicit documentations of high-risk ultrasound findings (HRF)-varies in radiology reports, potentially influenced by clinical and technical factors. To identify clinical and technical factors associated with increased interpretability of neonatal AUS in the evaluation of suspected intestinal injury needing surgical intervention. This retrospective, single-center case series reviewed AUS exams performed from 2022 to 2024 at a level IV neonatal intensive care unit. All neonates who had AUS performed prior to exploratory laparotomy were included in the study. For this project \"interpretability of AUS\" was defined as the number of explicit reporting of eight predefined HRF indicative of surgical need: pneumoperitoneum, increased or decreased bowel wall thickness, reduced intestinal perfusion on color Doppler, absent or decreased peristalsis, bowel dilation, complex intra-abdominal fluid collections, and reversed orientation of the superior mesenteric artery and vein. Clinical and technical factors that may have potentially influenced interpretability were analyzed. Twenty-eight AUS exams from 18 neonates were analyzed. The median gestational age at birth was 34+2 weeks, and the median birth weight was 1.93 kg. The median HRF of all AUS exams were 2 (range 0-8). Higher-frequency ultrasound transducers (>10 MHz) improved interpretability of AUS images (HRF 4 vs. 1), particularly in neonates weighing <2 kg. Serial ultrasound evaluations within seven days of surgery were associated with greater interpretability compared to a single isolated exam (HRF 6 vs. 3). Clinical symptoms with hypotension or abdominal discoloration and examinations ordered with comprehensive clinical details for the attention of radiology team showed trends towards improved interpretability. In our pilot study, interpretability of neonatal AUS images was strongly influenced by using higher-frequency transducers (>10 MHz) with better resolution, particularly in neonates weighing <2 kg. Obtaining serial imaging improved subsequent interpretability."

    "abstract": "Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a rare disorder characterized by persistent eosinophilia, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction. Despite its highly heterogeneous clinical manifestations, cardiac and neurological complications are the most significant contributors to patient disability and mortality. We report the case of a 66-year-old man who was emergently admitted to the hospital with the chief complaint of \"sudden unsteady walking accompanied by deviation of the corner of the mouth for 15 hours\". Laboratory tests revealed a significantly elevated eosinophil percentage (47.4%, count: 6.76×109/L). Initial diagnostic evaluation, including head computed tomography (CT) combined with CT angiography and CT perfusion, showed no significant abnormalities. However, magnetic resonance imaging confirmed an acute infarct in the left basal ganglia-paraventricular area. To control hypereosinophilia, dexamethasone (10 mg/day) was initiated. Due to the patient's suboptimal therapeutic response, treatment was escalated to prednisolone (15 mg three times a day) for intensive management 2 days later. Following clinical stabilization, the regimen was transitioned back to dexamethasone for maintenance therapy (2.25 mg once daily at discharge), in accordance with standard steroid tapering protocols in HES. On the seventh day, the patient developed sudden signs of generalized peritonitis, and imaging revealed intestinal ischemia. By the tenth day, the classic triad of strangulated intestinal obstruction had emerged; that is, progressive abdominal pain, positive fecal occult blood (+++), and CT findings of a pneumoportogram with terminal ileal wall edema. Emergency exploratory laparotomy confirmed extensive intestinal necrosis, necessitating radical intestinal resection and jejunostomy. Following stepwise management, digestive tract reconstruction (jejunostomy reduction and end-to-side anastomosis of the small intestine and colon) was successfully performed. Current follow-up indicates a good prognosis. This case provides valuable clinical insights into the early identification and management of thrombotic critical conditions secondary to idiopathic HES. It also highlights multi-dimensional intervention strategies for short bowel syndrome, expanding post-intestinal resection management pathways."

    "abstract": "Boerhaave syndrome is a life-threatening condition caused by a spontaneous full-thickness rupture of the esophagus, typically following forceful vomiting. Esophageal variceal rupture is another potentially fatal condition commonly observed in patients with liver cirrhosis. These two conditions are usually reported independently, and their coexistence is extremely rare. Managing this combination is particularly challenging because of the need for both infection control and hemostasis in the presence of portal hypertension. We report the case of a 51-year-old man with liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Grade B) and a history of endoscopic variceal ligation, who presented with hematemesis followed by vomiting. He had not consumed any alcohol at that time and exhibited no signs of melena. Computed tomography revealed mediastinal emphysema, right-sided hemopneumothorax, and esophageal perforation. Endoscopy confirmed a lower esophageal tear with active variceal bleeding. Emergency surgery was performed via a right thoracotomy. A 35-mm longitudinal tear in the lower esophagus was identified and sutured; however, owing to tissue fragility and signs of infection, a T-tube was placed at the perforation site. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course, resumed oral intake on postoperative day 17, and was discharged without any complications on day 46. This was a rare case of Boerhaave syndrome complicated by ruptured esophageal varices. Surgical management with T-tube drainage was effective in controlling both infection and bleeding. Patients with esophageal varices may be at an increased risk of esophageal rupture, especially following vomiting. Awareness of this association is essential for timely diagnosis and management."

    "title": "Imaging stewardship for the diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis: Improved ultrasound performance can decrease emergency department length of stay.",
    "abstract": "When ultrasound (US) is non-diagnostic in pediatric patients being evaluated for appendicitis, additional imaging may be required, which incurs delays and increased cost in diagnosis. Our baseline diagnostic rate of US for appendicitis was 27.1 % and was lower for patients with moderate pediatric appendicitis scores (PAS). Due to poor US performance, in our original pathway, patients with moderate PAS underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) initially, resulting in increased emergency department length of stay (ED LOS). Our goal was to improve ultrasound performance so it could be used as first-line imaging for all patients. In 2022, all appendix ultrasounds performed in 2020 were reviewed for diagnostic accuracy. During this review, scanning technique and ambiguity in the reporting of findings were identified as major contributors to suboptimal ultrasound performance. In August 2022, sonographers participated in focused bowel and appendix US training. In November 2022, a standardized template for ultrasound and MRI was implemented. Due to improved ultrasound performance, in May 2024, the pathway was adapted so that all PAS levels underwent ultrasound initially. We monitored the impact of this pathway change on: 1) need for MR imaging after ultrasound, and 2) clinical team time (CTT, defined as time from patient being placed in an ED room to disposition). Our diagnostic US rate increased to 56 % from baseline of 27 %. After adjustment of the imaging protocol to an US first approach for all patients as opposed to high PAS scores only, we did not see an increase in the percentage of patients requiring axial imaging after ultrasound. CTT decreased from 347 to 299 min and imaging cost per patient decreased from $6177.38 to $4812.30 (p < 0.001). Sonographer training and a standardized template for reporting ultrasound findings can improve appendix ultrasound performance, and in turn reduce ED LOS."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common indication for emergency surgery in children. In cases of perforation, patients require post-operative intravenous antibiotics in hospital. However, some children fail to respond adequately, resulting in prolonged hospitalization. The optimal antibiotic regimen for perforated appendicitis remains uncertain. We propose a double-blind, randomized controlled pilot trial comparing two commonly used antibiotic strategies. Eligible participants include children <18 years undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy for perforated appendicitis. Following surgery, participants will be randomized to receive either: (1) piperacillin/tazobactam; or (2) ceftriaxone and metronidazole. The sample size for the pilot study is 16 participants (i.e., 8 per group). Feasibility outcomes include recruitment rate, protocol adherence, loss to follow-up, and cost per participant. This pilot study will assess the feasibility of conducting a blinded randomized controlled trial of postoperative antibiotic therapy in children with perforated appendicitis. To date, only one randomized trial has addressed this question, but it was limited by its single-center design, lack of blinding, and susceptibility to ascertainment bias and other methodological concerns. Findings from this pilot will inform the design of a larger, multicenter study with rigorous blinding and standardized outcome assessment to determine whether piperacillin-tazobactam or ceftriaxone and metronidazole provides superior outcomes.

    "abstract": "Recurrent fever and acute abdominal pain are common reasons for emergency visits, particularly in adolescents. These symptoms often lead to misdiagnosis and unnecessary surgeries like appendectomy. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), a rare autoinflammatory disorder, should be considered in patients with periodic febrile abdominal episodes, especially in those with a migration background. A 19-year-old male of Syrian origin presented with acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain, fever, arthralgia, and pleuritic chest pain. Similar episodes had occurred in the past and resolved spontaneously. Physical examination revealed signs of peritonism; laboratory results showed elevated C‑reactive protein (CRP; 35 mg/L) with normal white blood cell counts. Abdominal ultrasound excluded appendicitis. Conservative treatment (fluids, analgesics, dietary rest) led to full symptom resolution within 2 days. After recovery, a detailed family history revealed consanguinity and a relative with similar symptoms. The diagnosis of FMF was made based on the Tel Hashomer criteria. Colchicine therapy (1.0 mg/day) was initiated. This report illustrates a case of late-onset FMF in a migrant adolescent, with typical symptoms but without definitive serositis or confirmed genetic diagnosis at the time of treatment. The case underscores the importance of thorough history-taking and highlights the need to avoid unnecessary CT scans in similar settings. Awareness of FMF is crucial in nonendemic regions experiencing increased migration from high-incidence countries. HINTERGRUND: Wiederkehrendes Fieber und akute Bauchschmerzen gehören zu den häufigen Vorstellungsgründen in der Notaufnahme, insbesondere bei Jugendlichen. Diese Symptome führen nicht selten zu Fehldiagnosen und unnötigen chirurgischen Eingriffen wie einer Appendektomie. Das familiäre Mittelmeerfieber (FMF), eine seltene autoinflammatorische Erkrankung, sollte bei Patienten mit periodischen febrilen Bauchbeschwerden – v. a. mit Migrationshintergrund – differenzialdiagnostisch berücksichtigt werden. Ein 19-jähriger Mann syrischer Herkunft stellte sich mit akuten Schmerzen im rechten Unterbauch, Fieber, Arthralgien und atemabhängigen Thoraxschmerzen vor. Ähnliche Episoden waren in der Vergangenheit spontan abgeklungen. Klinisch zeigten sich Zeichen eines Peritonismus, laborchemisch ein erhöhter Level für C‑reaktives Protein (CRP; 35 mg/l) bei normalen Leukozyten. Sonographisch ergaben sich keine Hinweise auf eine Appendizitis. Unter konservativer Therapie (Infusionen, Analgetika, Nahrungskarenz) kam es innerhalb von 2 Tagen zur vollständigen Besserung. Eine ausführliche Familienanamnese offenbarte eine Konsanguinität und einen ähnlichen Fall in der Familie. Die Diagnose FMF wurde anhand der Tel-Hashomer-Kriterien gestellt. Eine Therapie mit Colchicin (1,0 mg/Tag) wurde begonnen. Der Fall zeigt eine Spätmanifestation des FMF bei einem jugendlichen Migranten mit typischer Klinik, jedoch ohne nachgewiesene Serositis oder genetische Bestätigung zum Zeitpunkt der Behandlung. Er verdeutlicht die Bedeutung einer sorgfältigen Anamnese und spricht gegen den routinemäßigen Einsatz der Computertomographie(CT)-Diagnostik bei ähnlicher Konstellation. Das Bewusstsein für FMF sollte auch in Ländern mit niedriger Prävalenz erhöht werden."

This reflective case report describes a rare presentation of EC complicated by pneumoperitoneum, without free bile or identifiable perforation. It highlights the diagnostic challenges and the management considerations associated with this severe condition. A 64-year-old male with type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity and other comorbidities presented with a six-day history of abdominal pain and bloating. Blood tests revealed marked leukocytosis with neutrophilia and an elevated C-reactive protein. Despite an unremarkable abdominal exam, CT imaging revealed gas within the gallbladder lumen, walls and free intraperitoneal air, without associated free fluid or bile. Emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy revealed a necrotic, gas-containing gallbladder and localised pus, but no perforation. The patient recovered well with targeted antibiotic therapy. This case highlights that pneumoperitoneum in the absence of free bile or visible perforation can occur in EC. Awareness of this atypical presentation is critical to avoid diagnostic delay and ensure timely surgical management."

    "abstract": "Caecal volvulus following colonoscopy represents an extremely rare complication with only a few cases documented in the literature. We report the case of a 67-year-old woman who developed caecal volvulus 24 hours following routine colonoscopy with polypectomy. The patient presented with progressive cramping abdominal pain and nausea. Computed tomography revealed caecal displacement to the right upper abdomen without proximal ascending colon distension. Laparoscopic exploration confirmed caecal volvulus with ischaemia but no perforation. A laparoscopic right hemicolectomy was successfully performed, representing the first reported case managed with this minimally invasive approach. The patient recovered without complications and was discharged on postoperative day 5. This case emphasises the importance of maintaining high clinical suspicion for caecal volvulus in patients presenting with abdominal pain following colonoscopy. Early recognition and prompt laparoscopic intervention can prevent progression to bowel necrosis and perforation while offering superior outcomes compared to traditional open surgical approaches. The minimally invasive technique provides excellent visualisation, reduced morbidity, and faster recovery times, establishing it as the preferred management approach when surgical expertise is available."

Penetration into the left atrium is extremely rare, and only a few cases have been reported. A case of foreign body penetration into the left atrium is reported. The patient was a 75-year-old woman who was transferred to our hospital for surgery due to fish bone perforation from the lower esophagus into the left atrium on CT. Urgent surgery was performed with the diagnosis of sepsis due to a mediastinal abscess and esophageal penetration into the left atrium caused by accidental fish bone ingestion. At surgery, only the fistula of the penetration wound in the esophagus and the left atrium could be detected, but not the fish bone. On CT after surgery, a folded fish bone was seen at the pericardium close to the left atrium. It was considered unlikely that the heart would again be perforated due to the fish bone's length, and it was decided to follow up with continued antimicrobial therapy. A rare, successfully rescued case of esophageal penetration of an accidentally ingested fish bone into the left atrium by urgent surgery, with collaboration between gastrointestinal and cardiovascular surgeons, is reported."

    "abstract": "Malignant colorectal obstruction (MCO) is a common and life-threatening presentation of colorectal cancer, traditionally managed with emergency surgery associated with high morbidity and high stoma rates. Self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) have emerged as an important alternative for both palliation and as a bridge to curative resection. This review summarizes recent advances in indications, technical aspects, and emerging applications of colonic stenting, highlighting its role in modern multidisciplinary care. Current evidence supports the use of SEMS as one of the first-line palliative approaches in selected patients, providing rapid symptom relief and reducing the need for permanent stomas. In carefully selected patients, colonic SEMS can convert urgent high-risk operations into planned resections, facilitating minimally invasive approaches, though concerns remain regarding perforation risk and long-term oncologic outcomes. Increasing operator expertise, device innovation, and technical advances continue to improve safety and success rates. Beyond malignancy, expanding applications include refractory benign strictures, diverticular obstruction, and the use of lumen-apposing metal stents (LAMS) in inflammatory bowel disease and anastomotic complications. Colonic stenting has emerged as a valuable alternative to surgery for the management of MCO and is being investigated in select benign conditions, though broader adoption requires further evidence. Future research should refine patient selection, compare stenting with surgical alternatives, and clarify long-term outcomes."

    "abstract": "Accidental ingestion of foreign objects is a frequent emergency presentation that can lead to serious complications. It is most often seen in children and high-risk adults, but remains rare in healthy adolescents without predisposing factors. We describe a 17-year-old female who accidentally swallowed a metallic bullet casing during a meal. She presented two hours later with only a mild sore throat. Serial abdominal radiographs demonstrated progressive passage of the casing through the gastrointestinal tract without perforation or obstruction. With close inpatient monitoring, including clinical evaluations and sequential imaging, the casing was spontaneously expelled per rectum. The patient remained asymptomatic, and follow-up showed no complications. Most blunt, small foreign bodies pass spontaneously. This case highlights that, in carefully selected asymptomatic patients, conservative management with vigilant monitoring is a safe and effective alternative to invasive intervention. Conservative management can be both safe and effective in healthy adolescents who accidentally ingest a foreign body, provided there are no clinical or radiological signs of obstruction, perforation, or other complications."

Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of POCUS. Comparison to radiology-performed ultrasound in terms of agreement of findings. 226 patients were included in our study, of which 130 (58%) were boys. The mean age of patients was 9.7 years. 28 patients had appendicitis confirmed on histological examination, giving a prevalence of 12.4%.

In this report, we describe an unusual radiological finding of bubble tea pearls (small, chewy spheres derived from cassava starch) on computed tomography (CT) from an increasingly popular drink among adolescents. An 11-year-old female presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed generalized abdominal tenderness, with increased pain in the right lower quadrant. The patient's history was concerning for acute appendicitis. Laboratory results were unremarkable, and ultrasound was inconclusive for suspected appendicitis. A contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen found several ingested radiopaque densities within the stomach. Further toxicology testing was negative or within normal limits. It was later found that the patient had consumed bubble tea earlier in the day. The patient was admitted for monitoring, and symptoms resolved spontaneously the following morning. When pearl-like, radiopaque densities are found in the abdomen, bubble tea could be considered as a possible etiology to prevent unnecessary workup and exposure to radiation for pediatric patients."

    "title": "A Case Report of Thyroid Storm with Cardiovascular Collapse After Propranolol Administration.",
    "abstract": "Thyroid storm is a rare, life-threatening emergency with a 3.6-17% mortality rate despite proper management. Elevated levels of circulating thyroid hormones can increase metabolic demand, leading to adverse effects on multiple organ systems, particularly critical cardiovascular complications such as cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmias, or coronary vasospasm. Precipitating factors can include infection, surgery, or trauma, with infection being the most common. The potential for cardiovascular mortality is high. While beta blockers are key for treatment, they can potentially reduce necessary cardiac output, risking hemodynamic collapse. Traditionally, propranolol has been recommended. We report a rare case of an adolescent experiencing cardiac arrest after propranolol administration in thyroid storm and acute appendicitis. A 17-year-old female with a history of Grave disease, non-adherent to methimazole, underwent evaluation and treatment of thyroid storm and concomitant acute appendicitis. Aggressive initial treatment measures were started, including intravenous and oral propranolol. She went into cardiac arrest approximately six hours after initial medication administration, with subsequent return of spontaneous circulation achieved. The patient underwent aggressive resuscitation and multidisciplinary management. She had a prolonged course in the intensive care unit and was ultimately discharged from the hospital approximately three weeks later. Beta-blocker use in the management of thyrotoxicosis can potentially cause cardiovascular collapse. We suggest consideration of shorter acting beta blockers, such as esmolol or landiolol."

This study aimed to compare perioperative and clinical outcomes of colorectal cancer patients presenting with emergency large-bowel obstruction to those undergoing planned elective resection. Methods This retrospective cohort study reviewed 237 adult CRC resections performed during the study period. Seventy patients (29.5%) presented as emergent cases with radiologic or endoscopic obstruction, while 167 patients (70.5%) underwent elective procedures. Data collected included demographics, presenting symptoms, serum albumin levels, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) values, tumor location, histology, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, surgical details, 30-day mortality, surgical site infection (SSI) rates, length of hospital stay, and adjuvant therapy completion rates. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests, while continuous variables were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test, with significance set at p<0.05. Results Both groups demonstrated similar demographics with mean age of approximately 56 years. The obstructed group had 52 males (74.3%) and 18 females (25.7%), while the non-obstructed group had 102 males (61.1%) and 65 females (38.9%) (p=0.07). Obstructed patients more frequently presented with abdominal pain (52.9% vs. 17.4%), vomiting (58.6% vs. 1.2%), constipation (30.0% vs. 7.8%), and abdominal distension (22.9% vs. 1.2%) (all p<0.001). Advanced tumor stage was significantly more common in the obstruction group, with Stage I occurring in 2.9% versus 34.7% and Stage IV in 40.0% versus 28.7% of non-obstructed cases (p<0.001). Emergency cases demonstrated significantly higher 30-day mortality (25.7% vs. 3.6%; p<0.001), increased surgical site infections (28.6% vs. 15.0%; p=0.024), prolonged hospital stays (mean 15.6±5.5 vs. 10.3±4.7 days; p<0.0001), and lower adjuvant therapy completion rates (52.9% vs. 75.4%; p=0.001). Conclusion Obstructive colorectal cancer presentation significantly worsens perioperative mortality, morbidity, and therapy completion rates compared to elective resection cases. Early detection strategies, optimized perioperative care protocols, and treatment at high-volume centers are critical interventions needed to improve outcomes for patients presenting with obstructive colorectal cancer."

This study aims to compare the accuracy of both systems. A prospective study was conducted at Hayatabad Medical Complex, Peshawar, from August 2024 to September 2025, including 100 patients with suspected acute appendicitis. Both RIPASA and Alvarado scores were assessed and compared with intraoperative findings using the Gomez classification. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and overall diagnostic accuracy were calculated. The mean patient age was 28.1 years; 54% were male. Common presenting features were anorexia (90%), tenderness (99%), rebound tenderness (94%), and pain migration (76%). The RIPASA score showed sensitivity of 91.9%, specificity of 64.3%, PPV of 94.1%, NPV of 56.3%, and accuracy 88%. The Alvarado score demonstrated sensitivity of 94.2%, specificity of 57.1%, PPV of 93.1%, NPV of 61.5%, and accuracy 89%. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78 for RIPASA and 0.76 for Alvarado. Both the RIPASA and Alvarado scores demonstrated high accuracy, with Alvarado showing slightly higher sensitivity (94.2% vs. 91.9%) and RIPASA offering better specificity (64.3% vs. 57.1%). Overall, both scoring systems proved reliable tools for diagnosis, helping reduce negative appendectomy rates and improving clinical decision-making."

There is variation in the type of post-operative antibiotics used for these patients. We conducted systematic searches of Medline, Embase, and Cochrane for comparative studies of children with perforated appendicitis treated with post-operative piperacillin/tazobactam versus ceftriaxone and metronidazole. We identified four studies consisting of 25,730 children with perforated appendicitis treated with laparoscopic appendectomy followed by post-operative piperacillin/tazobactam (n = 9,950) or ceftriaxone and metronidazole (n = 15,780). One study was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and three were multicenter observational studies. Meta-analysis suggested no differences between piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftriaxone and metronidazole in terms of deep/organ-space surgical site infection (risk ratio [RR] = 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57-1.65), post-operative imaging (RR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.71-1.37), return to the emergency department (RR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.50-1.37), and readmission to hospital (RR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.45-1.62). Heterogeneity between studies was substantial (I2 73-83%). The RCT was limited by possible ascertainment bias, while the three observational studies may have been affected by baseline differences between treatment groups.

    "abstract": "Acute colorectal emergencies, including bowel obstruction, perforation, and ischemia, require rapid surgical intervention and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. While robotic surgery has demonstrated clear benefits in elective colorectal procedures, its application in emergency scenarios remains limited and under-investigated. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to assess the safety and effectiveness of robotic surgery compared to conventional laparoscopic and open approaches in the management of acute colorectal emergencies. We performed a comprehensive literature search across Cochrane, PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases from inception through December 2024, following PRISMA guidelines. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and case-control studies comparing robotic surgery with traditional techniques in acute colorectal emergencies. Primary outcomes were operative time, conversion to open surgery, and complication rates. Secondary outcomes included mortality, reoperation rates, and hospital length of stay. A random-effects model was applied to account for study heterogeneity. Fifteen studies encompassing 2,340 patients (1,170 robotic, 1,170 conventional) were included. Robotic procedures were associated with longer operative times (mean difference [MD] 48.7 min; 95% CI 32.1-65.3; p < 0.001), but demonstrated significantly lower conversion rates to open surgery (odds ratio [OR] 0.42; 95% CI 0.26-0.68; p = 0.001) and reduced overall complication rates (OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.45-0.83; p = 0.002). No significant differences were found for mortality (OR 0.91; 95% CI 0.58-1.42; p = 0.67), reoperation rates (OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.51-1.19; p = 0.25), or length of hospital stay (MD -0.3 days; 95% CI -0.9 to 0.3; p = 0.31). Robotic surgery in acute colorectal emergencies appears to reduce conversion and complication rates compared to conventional approaches, despite increased operative times. These findings support the potential role of robotic techniques in emergency settings. Further high-quality RCTs are needed to validate long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness."

We report a unique case of necrotizing peritonitis following laparoscopic feeding jejunostomy in a patient with esophageal carcinoma. With a limited number of cases reported due to its rarity, this case highlights the importance of recognition of aberrant postoperative complications and early surgical intervention. We report the case of a 50-year-old woman with distal esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who underwent laparoscopic feeding jejunostomy on 9 January 2023. She returned to the emergency department on 13 January 2023, with abdominal pain and vomiting. Diagnostic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed portal venous gas, diffuse peritoneal air, and soft tissue emphysema. An emergency laparotomy confirmed necrotizing peritonitis with patchy bowel necrosis and contamination near the jejunostomy site. Despite receiving aggressive medical and surgical management, the patient progressed to multiorgan failure and died on 13 January 2023. The patient's rapid clinical deterioration with extensive portal venous gas and intraoperative findings of patchy transmural bowel necrosis pointed toward a severe systemic infectious process. While subcutaneous emphysema is usually benign post-laparoscopically, its widespread nature with signs of sepsis in this case hinted more toward a necrotic pathology. CT imaging showed free intraperitoneal air, mesenteric edema, and fat stranding pointing toward bowel necrosis. These findings differentiated from other diagnosis like mesenteric panniculitis. This case underscores the critical importance of early recognition, CT imaging, and timely surgical exploration in improving survival in such rare postoperative complications."

The patient had a medical history of hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease, and previous surgeries, including laparoscopic appendectomy and ovarian cystectomy. Computed tomography revealed a high-grade, incomplete SBO. Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed thick band adhesions arising from a residual appendiceal stump from previous appendectomy site, which had caused a clockwise torsion of jejunal loops; division of the band and completion appendicectomy resolved the obstruction. These findings highlights the complex interplay between surgical technique and stump length in preventing adhesion formation. The formation of adhesions is primarily initiate from disturbances to peritoneal mesothelial surfaces, triggering inflammatory and coagulation pathways. Our discussion delves into the optimal management of the appendix stump, highlighting current literature that suggests a stump length of approximately 5 mm as optimal for minimising the risk of both stump appendicitis and appendicular band adhesions. While traditional inversion of the stump may limit exposed mucosa, it is not universally recommended because an inverted stump can later mimic a caecal mass or create diagnostic uncertainty. When a laparoscopic endoloop technique is selected, achieving a critical view of the appendix with complete visualisation of the caeco-appendiceal junction before ligation, allows precise placement of the loop flush with the base, thereby keeping the residual stump short and reducing the risk of stump appendicitis. Identifying high-risk patients, with prior abdominal surgery or severe intra-operative inflammation, and tailoring stump management accordingly remain crucial to preventing complications, such as appendicular band syndrome."

    "abstract": "Individuals with liver cirrhosis (LC) are likely to experience multiple infectious processes due to the immune dysfunction caused by the disease. Our hypothesis is that this group of patients is predisposed to fungal infections. To date, the incidence of spontaneous fungal peritonitis (SFP) has not been determined in Mexico; this endeavor is of great importance because many patients may be suffering from this condition without receiving targeted treatment, which may increase mortality. To report the incidence of SFP in patients presenting with decompensated LC with ascites. This was a prospective, single-center, descriptive, observational and cross-sectional study where patients presenting with decompensated LC with ascites were evaluated from November 2023 to May 2024 in Mexico City. Fungal cultures of ascites were performed and the samples kept in an incubator for 10 days to 14 days, and molecular tests (the API 20 C AUX test) were used for molecular characterization. Of the 48 patients included, 54.2% were women, 77.1% had a comorbidity, 47.9% had LC secondary to metabolic dysfunction, 43.8% were classified as Child-Pugh C with a model for end-stage liver disease 3.0 median score of 22, and 10.4% were in secondary prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Only four patients had positive cultures where Candida parapsilosis and Candida albicans were isolated, with two of the four patients being positive for Rhodotorula minuta; an SBP incidence of 8.3% was thus calculated. Chronic kidney disease [P = 0.012 and relative risk (RR) = 15] and secondary prophylaxis for SBP (P = 0.049 with RR = 8.6) were statistically significant and associated with a high mortality risk (P = 0.001 with RR = 33). The presence of infection of fungal origin in ascites in patients presenting with cirrhosis increases short- and medium-term mortality; therefore, it is recommended that fungal culture tests are performed in those patients who visit the emergency room or experience continuous admission with acute decompensation and no bacteria identified in ascites cultures, and even more so in patients with chronic kidney disease and a history of antibiotic use as prophylaxis for SBP. Further studies are needed for the identification of clinical and biochemical data that can help to define SFP so that its presence may be assessed without the need to wait for a positive fungal culture. Thus, treatment may be initiated early in the hope of having a positive impact on the prognosis in this group of patients."

    "abstract": "Bochdalek hernias are rare congenital defects usually diagnosed in infancy, and their presentation in adults is uncommon. Even rarer is the occurrence of acute appendicitis within a Bochdalek hernia; to date, only two adult cases have been reported, both involving right-sided or unspecified hernias. We describe a 21-year-old previously healthy man who presented with sudden left-sided chest pain and mild respiratory symptoms. Imaging identified a left posterolateral diaphragmatic hernia containing bowel loops and an inflamed appendix. He underwent emergency laparotomy with appendectomy and primary repair of the diaphragmatic defect without mesh due to contamination risk. Histopathology confirmed acute suppurative appendicitis. The patient's recovery was uneventful, and he remained well at follow-up. This case underscores the diagnostic challenge posed by atypical thoracic presentations of abdominal pathology and highlights the critical role of computed tomography in enabling timely surgical intervention."

    "abstract": "Background Perforation peritonitis, a common surgical emergency, is associated with postoperative respiratory complications. This study aimed to measure diaphragmatic excursion and thickness using preoperative ultrasound in patients undergoing laparotomy for perforation peritonitis, thereby predicting extubation outcomes at the end of the surgery. Methodology A total of 80 patients aged 18-60 years, belonging to the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical class I-III, scheduled to undergo laparotomy under general anesthesia were included in this study. The study sample was divided into the following two groups (40 in each group): Group P, perforation peritonitis patients undergoing emergency laparotomy, and Group C, patients undergoing elective laparotomy. Preoperatively, diaphragm excursion on deep inspiration and diaphragmatic thickness at end-inspiration and end-expiration were measured using ultrasound in both groups. Respiratory rate, arterial blood gas analysis, abdominal girth, duration of surgery, extubation outcome, and duration of mechanical ventilation were recorded and compared between the groups. Results Diaphragm excursion was significantly reduced in Group P (1.62 cm) compared to Group C (3.3 cm) (p < 0.001). Diaphragm thickness at end-inspiration and end-expiration was significantly reduced in Group P compared to Group C (p = 0.008). In Group P, diaphragm thickness at end-inspiration and end-expiration was significantly higher in those who were successfully extubated. From the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, a diaphragmatic thickness cut-off value of 0.15 cm at end-inspiration and 0.14 cm at end-expiration predicted successful extubation in Group P. Conclusions In this study, diaphragmatic excursion and thickness were significantly reduced in patients with perforation peritonitis. Hence, diaphragmatic thickness can be a useful predictor of extubation outcomes at the end of the surgery."

    "abstract": "Acute perforated cholecystitis (APC) is a serious complication of acute cholecystitis and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in elderly or high-risk patients. While emergency cholecystectomy is the standard of care, it may not be feasible in unstable patients. Percutaneous transhepatic cholecystostomy (PTC) offers a minimally invasive alternative. To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of PTC as an initial treatment modality for APC. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with APC between January 2017 and October 2022 at a single tertiary medical center. All patients underwent PTC as the initial intervention. Data collected included demographics, comorbidities, laboratory and imaging findings, complications, and clinical outcomes over a 24-month follow-up. Patients were stratified into two groups based on whether they subsequently underwent cholecystectomy. Thirty patients underwent PTC for APC. Half of the patients (n = 15) were stabilized and later underwent cholecystectomy; the remaining 15 were managed non-operatively. Patients in the non-surgical group were significantly older (87.1 ± 6.2 years vs 76.1 ± 7.4 years; P < 0.001). Clinical improvement was observed in 61.4% of non-operated patients, with eventual drain removal or closure. Both groups demonstrated significant reductions in white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels from admission to discharge. No significant differences were found in hospital stay or complication rates. During follow-up, three deaths occurred due to non-biliary causes. Only one patient required repeat drainage. PTC is a safe and effective initial treatment for APC, particularly in elderly and comorbid patients for whom surgery poses excessive risk. It provides clinical stabilization and may serve either as a bridge to delayed cholecystectomy or as definitive management in selected patients. These findings support the broader use of PTC in the management of APC, although larger prospective studies are warranted."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency worldwide. While the use of preoperative antibiotics has shown clear benefits in improving outcomes for uncomplicated appendicitis, the necessity of routine postoperative antibiotics remains a topic of debate. This meta-analysis evaluates the impact of preoperative and postoperative antibiotics on patient outcomes, adverse events, and hospital stay duration. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted, including 14 studies published over the past 15 years, focusing on patients aged 14-65 with uncomplicated appendicitis. Both experimental and observational designs were included. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, Excel, and RevMan to assess adverse effects, hospital stays, and antibiotic duration outcomes. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool, with all included studies showing low risk across key domains. The study received no external funding and was not registered in any clinical trial database. Preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis demonstrated significant benefits, including shorter hospital stays and reduced postoperative complications. Metronidazole was the most frequently prescribed antibiotic, followed by cefoxitin and cefuroxime. Conversely, the use of postoperative antibiotics was associated with increased rates of adverse events, including Clostridium difficile infections, deep surgical site infections, and urinary tract infections. Patients receiving only preoperative antibiotics experienced fewer complications and improved overall outcomes than those receiving postoperative antibiotics. Preoperative antibiotics, such as metronidazole and cefoxitin, are sufficient to optimize outcomes in uncomplicated appendicitis. Postoperative antibiotics offer no additional benefit and are associated with a higher risk of adverse events. These findings support limiting antibiotic use to the preoperative phase, aligning with antimicrobial stewardship principles, and ensuring safer, more cost-effective patient care. A revision of clinical guidelines is recommended to reflect these findings and enhance evidence-based practices in managing uncomplicated appendicitis. Despite some heterogeneity in study design and follow-up variability, this meta-analysis remains robust due to consistent inclusion criteria, high-quality studies, a large sample size, and rigorous methods like the Mantel-Haenszel model."

Our aim is to describe Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients with occlusive arterial acute mesenteric ischemia (OAAMI) hospitalized in the ISC. Retrospective study including patients with OAAMI requiring ICU hospitalization from 2016 to 2021. The primary objective was to identify risk factors for 28-day and one-year mortality. Secondary objectives were to describe initial digestive and vascular management, and patient outcomes from ICU to one year. We enrolled 133 critically ill patients with OAAMI (78.2% thrombotic, 85.7% mesenteric artery culprit). Emergency laparotomy was performed in 108 (81.2%) patients, revealing extensive intestinal necrosis beyond any therapeutic resource in 14 (10.5%) patients and segmental intestinal necrosis requiring resection in 45 (33.8%) patients. Arterial revascularization was performed in 105 (78.9%) patients. 28-day and one-year mortality rates were 33.1% and 46.6%. Mortality risk factors were age, lactatemia at admission, and intestinal necrosis. Mortality rates of patients with three factors were 75% at Day 28 and 100% at one year. Intestinal failure concerned 59.8% of patients discharged alive from the ICU, but only 18.3% of survivors at one year still required parenteral nutrition. We report 28-day and one-year outcomes of critically ill patients with OAAMI, suggesting that ISC management based on a life- and gut-saving strategy management may improve prognosis. Identified risk factors may help to select patients who would really benefit from this aggressive strategy."

This study aims to evaluate clinical and biochemical parameters that predict mortality in cases of bowel perforation. A retrospective analysis was performed on 144 patients who underwent surgical intervention for bowel perforation between 2019 and 2024. Key variables assessed included the albumin/creatinine ratio, age, serum albumin levels, CRP, and history of COVID-19. Mortality-associated variables were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression, as well as receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The mean age of the patients was 60 years, with 84 patients (58.3%) being male. The overall mortality rate was 25%. Independent predictors of mortality identified in the study included an albumin/creatinine ratio <3.38 (odds ratio [OR]: 12.666, p<0.001), age >66 years (OR: 3.273, p=0.036), and serum albumin levels <3 g/dL (OR: 5.653, p=0.002). ROC analysis indicated that the area under the curve (AUC) for the albumin/creatinine ratio was 0.879, establishing it as the parameter with the highest predictive accuracy for mortality. Among patients with a history of COVID-19, ischemia was the predominant cause of perforation (87.5%), while malignancy was the leading cause (41.4%) in those without a COVID-19 history. This difference in etiology was statistically significant (p<0.001). In conclusion, the albumin/creatinine ratio, age, and serum albumin levels are robust parameters for predicting mortality in bowel perforation cases. Furthermore, a history of COVID-19 significantly increases the risk of bowel perforation due to ischemia."

    "abstract": "Background It is well documented in the literature that the most common diagnosis for acute abdomen is nonspecific abdominal pain (NSAP). The context of NSAP in the literature is either (a) ranking it among other causes of acute abdomen or (b) addressing that some patients revisited the ED with a different diagnosis after being initially labeled with NSAP. These two contexts create a gap, as no article has discussed the characteristics of patients mislabeled with NSAP in KSA. In other words, what might be the risk factors making their presentation nonspecific? In this article, we discuss the characteristics of patients labeled with NSAP who revisited the ED within three days and were subsequently diagnosed with a different condition, if found. Methodology The study was a retrospective cohort study. Data were taken from case files at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC), a tertiary hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, using the Best-Care system. All adults who attended the ED and were discharged with the diagnosis of NSAP (ICD code R10.4) between 2015 and 2023 were included. Patients were then tracked for 3 days, which is the cutoff commonly used in ED research. Statistical analysis was performed using R 4.3. Categorical variables were summarized using counts and percentages, and continuous variables (normal and non-normal) using mean ± SD and median/IQR. The chi-square test was used to assess associations, and logistic regression analysis was used to predict revisits. Only statistically significant variables were included, and hypothesis testing was performed at a 5% level of significance. Results A total of 932 patients were discharged from the ED with NSAP. Out of these, 69 (7.4%) revisited the ED within 3 days and received a different diagnosis. The study found significant age differences between the two groups: the median age was 40 years (IQR: 27-58) in non-revisited patients and 29 years (IQR: 21-42) in re-visited patients. A higher proportion of re-visited patients had a BMI over 25 (64.1% vs. 40.6%, p < 0.001). Surgical history also showed a significant difference, with 39.1% of re-visited patients having a history of abdominal surgery compared to 18.2% of non-revisited patients (p < 0.001). Acute cholecystitis was the most common diagnosis during the second visit, accounting for 32.3% of revisits, followed by appendicitis. Re-visited patients also showed a higher prevalence of hypothyroidism (13.4% vs. 1.27%) and a higher incidence of type 2 diabetes (8.96% vs. 1.27%). Conclusion This retrospective cohort study revealed several significant findings regarding factors associated with ED revisits following an initial discharge with a diagnosis of NSAP. The most common diagnosis identified during the second visit was acute cholecystitis."

    "abstract": "Intussusception is a recognized cause of bowel obstruction and is significantly more common in paediatric patients. Adult intussusception is rare and usually results from a predisposing factor in most patients. These factors may include benign lesions, malignant lesions, or bowel wall abnormalities such as inflammatory bowel disease. We report on a case of a patient who presented with recurrent colicky central abdominal pain, anorexia, vomiting with occasional constipation and diarrhoea for six months. She was assessed and investigated with abdominal USS and Computer Tomography (CT) Scan, which showed features of intussusception, with telescoping of the jejunum with proximal bowel distension suggesting bowel obstruction. The patient underwent emergency laparotomy and surgical resection, and histopathology confirmed the lead point as intraluminal lipoma. We present a case of jejuno-jejunal intussusception in an adult, which is not commonly seen. The history of recurrent colicky abdominal pain and CT abdomen, together with an abdominal ultrasound scan (USS), was important in establishing a preoperative diagnosis, and histology confirmed lipoma as a lead point. Despite the conservative approach described in the literature, surgery continues to be the only option in patients who are unstable with persistent colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, abdominal distension, and constipation; Surgery is advocated for all adult patients. Adult intussusception is not a common condition and can be difficult to diagnose, posing a diagnostic conundrum. Patients with intussusception may report a relatively long period of recurrent colicky abdominal pain that might worsen acutely following complete obstruction. Abdominal CT scan is a very useful investigation in the preoperative diagnosis of intussusception, with histopathological confirmation of lipoma as a lead point."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Hepatosplenic cat scratch disease, a form of atypical cat scratch disease, is rare in immunocompetent adults, and presentations can mimic those of potentially lethal diseases. Nonetheless, diagnosis can be challenging due to underrecognition of the disease, as well as variability in the sensitivity of diagnostic testing. CASE REPORT A 39-year-old woman with no major medical history presented to the Emergency Department with right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Vital signs were stable, and laboratory findings were nonsignificant. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) with contrast was nonsignificant except for multiple low-enhancing nodules in the liver and spleen. Appendicitis was clinically suspected, and intravenous cefmetazole was initiated, followed by levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily, plus metronidazole 500 mg orally once daily for 7 days. Her abdominal symptoms resolved a week later, but hepatosplenic nodules were still evident on CT. A thorough medical interview revealed frequent cat exposure. Despite negative indirect fluorescent antibody assay results for anti-Bartonella henselae immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G, cat scratch disease was strongly suspected. She was treated with rifampicin 300 mg orally twice daily and azithromycin 500 mg once daily on the first day, followed by 250 mg once daily thereafter for 2 weeks in total. Two months after treatment, abdominal CT revealed resolution of the hepatosplenic nodules. CONCLUSIONS Although hepatosplenic cat scratch disease is rare in immunocompetent adults, it should be suspected in patients with multiple hepatosplenic nodules, even with negative serologic test results. In such cases, timely initiation of antibiotics can be beneficial."

An emergency CT of the abdomen and pelvis (CTAP) demonstrated a perforated ascending colon with the formation of abscesses within the hernia. The management involved an exploratory laparotomy, which showed evidence of a strangulated hernia; there was extensive ischaemia and congestion of the terminal ileum, cecum, appendix, ascending colon, and omentum. The surgical interventions included right hemicolectomy with ileostomy, drainage of the abscess in the abdominal wall, and hydrocelectomy. Postoperatively, the patient remained in the ICU for two days after the surgery; he developed a minor complication (surgical site infection (SSI) grade 1) and was later transferred to the ward and discharged after a week."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in children, yet timely and accurate diagnosis remains challenging due to nonspecific clinical presentations and limitations of imaging and blood tests. Saliva has emerged as a promising diagnostic medium because it is non-invasive, painless, inexpensive, and highly acceptable for pediatric patients. Salivary biomarkers may provide rapid and child-friendly adjuncts to existing diagnostic pathways. A systematic literature search was performed in Ovid/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library to identify studies assessing salivary biomarkers in pediatric appendicitis. Eligible studies included children with suspected or confirmed appendicitis and evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of salivary markers compared to clinical, laboratory, or imaging standards. To date, only three salivary biomarkers have been investigated. Leucine-rich α-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) demonstrated high specificity of 100% but low sensitivity of 35-36%, with diagnostic accuracy ranging from AUC 0.77 to 0.85. C-reactive protein (CRP) showed excellent diagnostic performance with sensitivity of 91.3% and specificity of 95.4% (AUC 0.97), and strong correlation with serum CRP (ρ = 0.96). Irisin showed sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 60% with estimated AUC around 0.75, suggesting potential as an adjunct marker but limited as a standalone test. Salivary biomarkers in pediatric appendicitis are promising but remain underexplored, with evidence limited to small, single-center studies totalling fewer than 300 patients. Their advantages include feasibility, tolerability, and suitability for integration into point-of-care testing. Future research should focus on multicenter validation, development of multi-marker salivary panels, and application of biosensor technologies. With further evidence, salivary diagnostics could complement existing strategies and improve the accuracy and child-friendliness of appendicitis care."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common non-obstetric surgical emergency during pregnancy. Diagnosing appendicitis in the third trimester remains especially challenging due to physiological changes that obscure clinical presentation and limit the utility of imaging modalities. These challenges can lead to diagnostic delays, increasing the risk of severe complications for both mother and fetus. We present a complex case of a 36-year-old pregnant woman at 29 + 4 weeks of gestation who developed acute appendicitis with an atypical clinical course. Her initial symptoms were nonspecific and misattributed to gastrointestinal discomfort related to pregnancy. Her condition progressively worsened, leading to an emergency laparoscopic appendectomy. Intraoperative findings confirmed a perforated, necrotic appendix. Postoperatively, she experienced multiple complications, including ileus, wound dehiscence, and complete eventration of the abdominal wall. These required two additional laparotomies and the application of vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy for effective wound management. Despite the severity of maternal complications and the risk of preterm delivery, a multidisciplinary team provided coordinated care. The patient was delivered vaginally at 34 + 4 weeks using vacuum assistance. The neonate, who developed sepsis, was treated in the neonatal intensive care unit and discharged after 24 days. Both mother and child ultimately recovered. This case highlights the diagnostic complexity of appendicitis in late pregnancy and the potential for severe postoperative complications. Prompt surgical intervention, high clinical suspicion, and a multidisciplinary approach are crucial. Moreover, this report adds to the limited literature on the use of VAC therapy for abdominal eventration in pregnancy, demonstrating its feasibility and safety in selected cases."

This study aimed to explore the predictive value of the immature granulocyte (IG) count in assessing strangulation in adhesive SBO. This was a retrospective analysis of patients with adhesive SBO, diagnosed surgically or by abdominal computed tomography (CT) from May 2022 to April 2025, comparing strangulated (SG) and non-strangulated (NSG) cases. Baseline levels of the IG count and related inflammatory biomarkers were analyzed using logistic regression analysis and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves to assess the predictive value for strangulation. 250 eligible patients in the SG (n = 167) and NSG (n = 83) groups were enrolled in this study. Compared to the NSG group, the SG group demonstrated significantly higher levels of white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil (NEU), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and IG count with statistical differences (all P < 0.001). In the analysis of logistic regression and ROC, the IG count demonstrated an independent risk for predicting strangulated adhesive SBO (OR 15.41, 95%CI 8.07–31.59, P < 0.001). The IG count had the highest area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.946 among the enrolled inflammatory biomarkers, particularly within 6 h from onset to hospital (AUC 0.961, 95% CI, 0.90-1.00). It showed an optimal cutoff value of 0.280 *109/L with a sensitivity of 89.50% and specificity of 100.00% for identifying strangulation in adhesive SBO. IG count was an early predictor for quick detection of strangulation in adhesive SBO within 6 h from onset to hospital.

The escalating prevalence of antibiotic resistance in R. anatipestifer underscores the urgent need for novel therapeutic agents. In this study, we demonstrated that Sophoraflavanone G (SFG), a lavandulylated flavanone derived from Sophora flavescens, exhibits rapid bactericidal activity against R. anatipestifer in vitro and shows a low propensity for inducing drug resistance. Mechanistic studies indicate that SFG binds to phosphatidylglycerol, compromising the structural and functional integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane in R. anatipestifer, which results in the leakage of intracellular contents. Further studies demonstrate that SFG disrupts bacterial proton motive force, promotes the intracellular accumulation of ATP and reactive oxygen species, and inhibits DNA and RNA biosynthesis. In the peritonitis model, SFG treatment significantly reduced the bacterial load in the tissues of infected ducklings and attenuated the tissue damage caused by R. anatipestifer infection. In conclusion, SFG represents a promising antibacterial agent with a low propensity for resistance development, offering potential for combating R. anatipestifer infections."

This international snapshot study describes the presentation, treatment, and overall outcomes of patients admitted acutely to hospital with CRC. Acute presentation of colorectal cancer-an international snapshot (APOLLO) was a prospective, international, cohort study enrolling consecutive patients admitted acutely to hospital with CRC from January to June 2023. The primary outcome was mortality at 90 days. Reasons for acute CRC presentation are described, as are the rates of surgical and nonsurgical management and mortality. Overall, 1861 patients (257 centers, 39 countries) were included (median age 70 years; females 44.8%). Rates of obstruction (54.5%; 1015 of 1861) and perforation (11.4%; 212 of 1861) are quantified. In total, 59.2% of patients were managed with curative intent (1102 of 1861). Curative management of right colon cancer predominantly involved resection and primary anastomosis (RPA) (78.5%). Curative management of left colon cancer predominantly involved either RPA or resection with end stoma formation (RES) (42.9% vs. 40.6%). Acute curative rectal cancer management strategies were more heterogeneous (RPA 21.8%, RES 26.7%, diverting stoma only 15.8%, no surgery 31.5%). Overall 90-day mortality was 17.5% (326 of 1861) and lower in those undergoing curative intent surgery (69 [7.3%] of 949). This international prospective snapshot study found a 17.5% 90-day mortality in patients presenting acutely with CRC, predominantly for obstruction. High levels of variation in the management of acutely presenting left colon cancer and rectal cancer are highlighted."

    "abstract": "Bladder inverted papilloma (BIP) is a rare, benign urothelial lesion that can mimic urothelial carcinoma endoscopically but is characterized histologically by an endophytic growth of anastomosing urothelial cords without muscular invasion. We report a single-center case series of four patients managed with complete transurethral resection between January 2022 and August 2025, with the inclusion criterion being a histopathological diagnosis: a 28-year-old man with a trigonal lesion complicated by bladder perforation that healed uneventfully, a 72-year-old man in whom a small peri-orificial lesion was resected during urgent ureteric stenting and subsequently followed on a low-risk bladder cancer pathway with no recurrence at three years, an 84-year-old man with a large polypoid lesion arising near the bladder neck that was completely excised, and a 72-year-old woman with a pedunculated lateral wall mass treated by resection and single-dose intravesical mitomycin, remaining disease-free at one year. Synthesizing contemporary evidence and our experience, we highlight that accurate histopathological confirmation, complete endoscopic excision, and multidisciplinary discussion are key to management; routine intensive cystoscopic surveillance appears unnecessary for unequivocal bladder BIP, whereas selective follow-up is reasonable when pathology raises a differential of low-grade urothelial neoplasm with inverted growth or when lesions arise outside the bladder, where malignant association is higher. These findings support a pragmatic, risk-adapted follow-up strategy after complete resection."

    "abstract": "Regarding rectal foreign bodies with gastrointestinal perforation, most objects are hard, and perforation by a condom has not been reported. We describe the case of a 48-year-old man who inserted a water-filled condom into his rectum and performed abdominal crunch exercises for the purpose of sexual arousal. After several repetitions, the condom ruptured. Physical examination revealed signs of peritoneal irritation, and computed tomography confirmed the presence of free air and perirectal fluid accumulation. The patient was diagnosed with acute generalized peritonitis, and emergent laparotomy revealed a full-thickness rectal injury of approximately 10 cm. Simple closure of the damaged bowel was performed, and a proximal diverting colostomy was created. Postoperatively, the patient developed a surgical site infection and was discharged on hospital day 49 following an extended recovery period. The colostomy was subsequently closed without complications. This case highlights that even a condom filled with water can cause upper rectal injury under increased abdominal pressure, such as abdominal exercises."

    "abstract": "Recent concerns regarding the delivery of surgical services in South Korea emphasize the need for close monitoring of spatial access to surgical care in patients with acute appendicitis at the regional level. This study included emergency department (ED) visits with acute appendicitis and subsequent appendectomies from the National Emergency Department Information System database (2015-2021). Travel distances to the hospital were measured, and the proportion of patients admitted to regional hospitals was visualized on a geographic map. Factors related to complicated appendicitis were analyzed using logistic regression. Among 207344 patients who visited the EDs, those from areas with low population density had higher proportions of patients aged ≥65 years (23.2%), Medical Aid recipients (4.8%), transfers from other hospitals (39.3%), and cases of complicated appendicitis (7.0%) compared to other regions. Additionally, patients in low-density regions had the highest proportion of traveling 50 km or more (27.7%), compared to those in mid-density (5.9%) and high-density (2.5%) regions. In the multivariate analysis, patients aged ≥65 years exhibited a stronger association with complicated appendicitis compared to other age groups. The current results suggested that regions with low population density experienced low access to surgical care, revealing significant regional variation linked to population density. Given the rapidly aging population and the concentration of residents in urban areas in South Korea, urgent policy action is needed to ensure the adequate delivery of emergency general surgery services in low-density regions."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the diagnostic accuracy of five inflammatory biomarkers - delta neutrophil index (DNI); C-reactive protein/albumin ratio (CAR); procalcitonin (PCT); immature granulocytes count (IGc); and hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte, platelet score (HALPs) - in detecting acute appendicitis (AA) and identifying the most reliable marker for distinguishing complicated from non-complicated cases. A prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary hospital emergency department, including 100 histopathologically confirmed AA patients and 100 healthy controls. Biomarker levels were analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curves. Sensitivity, specificity, and optimal cut-off values were determined via the Youden index, while logistic regression identified independent predictors of complicated appendicitis (CA). DNI exhibited the highest diagnostic accuracy for AA (AUC: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.821-0.919, p < 0.001) with 92% specificity and 69% sensitivity at a cut-off of 71.88. CAR (AUC: 0.853) and PCT (AUC: 0.852) showed similar performance, whereas IGc (AUC: 0.695) and HALPs (AUC: 0.627) were less effective. DNI also outperformed the Alvarado score in predicting CA (AUC: 0.698 vs 0.626) and was an independent predictor (OR: 3.18, 95% CI: 1.40-7.24, p = 0.006). DNI demonstrated superior diagnostic performance for AA and was the most reliable marker for identifying CA. Its integration into clinical practice may enhance early diagnosis and reduce unnecessary surgeries, improving outcomes."

    "abstract": "This report presents a rare case of a previously placed intrauterine device (IUD) subsequently found freely floating in the peritoneal cavity in a patient presenting with a kidney stone. A woman in her early 30s with a history of levonorgestrel IUD placement four years prior presented to the emergency department with sudden-onset, sharp, severe left lower quadrant pain. A CT scan demonstrated a 5 mm obstructing ureteral stone in the distal left ureter as well as an IUD in the inferior peritoneal cavity with no free air or bowel injury. This case, in the context of current literature surrounding migrated and perforated IUDs, is evaluated and presented in the following report. The device was successfully retrieved laparoscopically without incident. Intraoperative inspection showed no uterine perforation at the time of laparoscopy, no adhesions, and no involvement of adjacent structures or organs. Postoperative follow-up was conducted to assess recovery and symptom resolution. Intraperitoneal migration of IUDs, although rare, can occur and may remain asymptomatic for several years. Migration may be complicated by adhesions, perforation, and infection. However, ectopic IUDs may alternatively be free-floating in the peritoneal cavity without complications. Laparoscopic retrieval is safe and effective, and this can be considered the preferred method of retrieval in most cases."

    "abstract": "Perforated viscus remains a high-risk surgical emergency with significant mortality despite advances in perioperative care. Accurate risk stratification is essential to guide triage, surgical decision-making, and postoperative management. The available scoring tools are the Boey score (three-variable risk model: shock, comorbidity, delay >24 hours), Peptic Ulcer Perforation (PULP) score, Mannheim Peritonitis Index (MPI), Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the Enumeration of Mortality and Morbidity (POSSUM), and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE-II), each addressing different dimensions of patient risk, ranging from physiological stability to intra-abdominal severity. Simpler models such as Boey and MPI are valuable in emergency and resource-limited settings due to their bedside applicability. In contrast, PULP and APACHE-II offer greater precision by integrating systemic comorbidities and biochemical indices, making them more suitable for tertiary centers. POSSUM provides a balanced approach by combining physiology with operative severity, though it may overestimate mortality. No single model is universally applicable, highlighting the need for context-specific use. Future research should focus on hybrid scoring systems that merge clinical simplicity with modern predictive analytics for broader global relevance."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis (AA) is one of the most common causes of acute abdomen requiring urgent surgical intervention, and early recognition of complicated forms, such as perforation or gangrene, is crucial to reducing mortality and complications. In recent years, bilirubin has gained attention as a potential biomarker of disease severity. The aim of this systematic literature review was to evaluate the diagnostic usefulness of total bilirubin concentration as a marker of complications in AA, with particular emphasis on perforation, and to analyze its effectiveness in differentiating uncomplicated and complicated forms. A systematic search of PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar was performed to identify studies exploring the relationship between bilirubin levels and the severity of AA. The literature indicates a correlation between hyperbilirubinemia and perforated appendicitis. Bilirubin has higher diagnostic specificity compared to classical inflammatory markers such as leukocytosis or C-reactive protein (CRP), especially when combined with clinical assessment and imaging studies. Both retrospective and prospective studies suggest that elevated bilirubin significantly increases the risk of complicated disease. Based on the evidence synthesized in this review, hyperbilirubinemia appears to be associated with complicated forms of AA, particularly perforation. While it demonstrates higher specificity than classical inflammatory markers, the available studies emphasize that it should not be used as a stand-alone diagnostic marker. Instead, bilirubin may be considered a supportive parameter, particularly when interpreted together with clinical evaluation and imaging findings."

    "abstract": "Non-traumatic duodenal perforation is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition, typically caused by peptic ulcer disease, and traditionally requires urgent surgical intervention. However, in resource-limited settings, conservative management can be an effective alternative for selected patients, particularly those with localized contamination and comorbidities that make surgery high-risk. This case report describes the successful non-operative management of a 78-year-old woman with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and bronchial asthma, who presented with a seven-day history of right upper quadrant pain. Imaging with contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a localized second-part duodenal perforation with perihepatic extravasation of contrast, but no diffuse peritonitis. Given her frailty, a non-surgical approach was adopted, involving intravenous fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, and careful monitoring. The patient's condition improved progressively, with pain resolution and return to a light diet by day 10, and she was discharged on day 11. This case underscores the importance of precise imaging, judicious patient selection, and adaptive resource utilization in managing duodenal perforation in settings with limited resources, highlighting the feasibility of conservative management in high-risk patients."

    "abstract": "Background Colonic perforation is a rare but life-threatening surgical emergency with a broad spectrum of etiologies and presentations. This retrospective case series from a tertiary care center in Central India analyzes 15 consecutive cases to describe patient demographics, clinical features, diagnostic findings, perforation sites, etiologies (including iatrogenic and colonoscopy-related), management strategies, and outcomes, with an emphasis on early recognition and tailored surgical intervention. Methodology This retrospective, observational study included adults with confirmed colonic perforation treated between January 2022 and March 2025 at a tertiary care hospital in Central India. Data collection encompassed demographics, clinical presentation, duration of symptoms, diagnostic workup (imaging modalities, including X-ray and CT, and colonoscopy when available), perforation characteristics (site, suspected etiology, etc.), intraoperative findings, and definitive surgical management and its outcomes. Descriptive statistics were employed to summarize patterns and outcomes, with particular attention to associations among perforation site, cause, and chosen surgical strategy. Results The cohort showed a female predominance of 9/15 (60%), with 60% aged 60 years or older. All patients presented with abdominal pain; tenderness was universal, 15/15 (100%), with abdominal rigidity in 86.6% (13/15) and peritoneal signs in most cases. Pneumoperitoneum was detected on imaging in all patients, 15/15 (100%). The transverse colon was the most frequently involved site, 8/15 (53.3%), followed by the sigmoid, 3/15 (20%), and descending colon, 2/15 (13.3%). Etiologies included iatrogenic, colonoscopy-related perforations, as well as infectious, inflammatory, and spontaneous causes. Imaging consistently demonstrated pneumoperitoneum, with CT and X-ray aiding localization and planning. All patients underwent surgery, with management strategies including Hartmann's procedure, 6/15 (40%), primary repair, 5/15 (33.3%), and primary repair with diverting stoma, 3/15 (20%), decisions guided by the degree of contamination and patient stability. The outcomes underscore the importance of prompt surgical intervention and individualized decision-making to optimize results in this setting. Conclusions Early recognition and meticulous, patient-specific surgical management are essential for favorable outcomes in colonic perforation. The transverse and sigmoid colon emerged as common sites, reflecting anatomical vulnerabilities and procedure-related risks in this cohort. Cross-sectional imaging facilitates rapid localization and planning, enabling appropriate selection among primary repair, diversion, or resection with stoma. This study reinforces the value of a multidisciplinary, tailored approach to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with colonic perforation in resource-limited, high-volume centers, emphasizing the potential for improved survival through timely, evidence-informed clinical decisions."

    "abstract": "Aspergillus tracheobronchitis (AT) is a rare and severe manifestation of invasive aspergillosis, primarily affecting immunocompromised patients. The pseudomembranous subtype is associated with high mortality, particularly among those requiring mechanical ventilation. We report the case of an 86-year-old woman with nephrotic syndrome receiving corticosteroid and cyclosporine therapy who developed respiratory failure following emergency surgery for sigmoid colon perforation. After being admitted to the intensive care unit and placed on mechanical ventilation, she developed worsening oxygenation on ICU day 7. Chest computed tomography revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities, and serum β-D-glucan levels were elevated, initially raising suspicion for Pneumocystis pneumonia. Bronchoscopy on ICU day 12 showed no airway abnormalities,　but repeat bronchoscopy on day 14 demonstrated extensive tracheal pseudomembranes and a yellowish endobronchial plaque. Cytological and microbiological examinations confirmed Aspergillus fumigatus. Intravenous voriconazole was promptly administered, but her respiratory failure progressed, and she died on ICU day 16. Clinicians should consider AT in patients with progressive pneumonia after major surgery regardless of immune status, particularly when bacterial infection is excluded or antibiotic response is poor. Early and repeated bronchoscopy is crucial for timely diagnosis, and empirical antifungal therapy should be promptly considered to improve outcomes in suspected cases."

On examination, she was tachycardic, hypotensive, actively bleeding from the prolapse, and showed signs of small-bowel evisceration. Emergency laparotomy identified a 4-cm anterior uterine defect with 60 cm gangrenous ileum herniated ~15 cm from the ileocecal junction; the necrotic segment was resected and an ileostomy created, and definitive repair of the prolapse was performed. The patient recovered and was discharged on postoperative day seven.

Our aim was to assess whether the strategy of PD initiation interferes with clinical outcomes over the initial 180 days.MethodsThis retrospective study included incident kidney failure patients starting PD at a single center (November 2016-July 2022). Patients were divided into three groups: (1) Urgent-start (US-PD), initiated within 3 days after catheter insertion without prior hemodialysis (HD); (2) Early-start (ES-PD), initiated between 3-14 days, including those with ≤30 days of prior HD; (3) Planned-start (Plan-PD), initiated after 15 days without prior HD. Mechanical and infectious complications, hospitalizations, mortality, and time on PD were compared at 180 days. Patient dropout was defined as the discontinuation of PD due to death or transfer to HD.ResultsA total of 211 patients were included: 118 (55.9%) US-PD, 46 (21.9%) ES-PD, and 47 (22.2%) Plan-PD. Among ES-PD patients, 15 (32.6%) had prior HD (<30 days - median time 19 days). Catheter insertion was mostly performed by nephrologists (60.6%) using the modified Seldinger technique (59.2%). Early complications included catheter dysfunction, which occurred in 12.7% of the overall cohort (17.8% in US-PD vs. 4.3% in ES-PD vs. 8.5% in Plan-PD; p = 0.04), and leakage, observed in 7.1% of the overall cohort (9.3% in US-PD vs. 6.5% in ES-PD vs. 2.1% in Plan-PD; p = 0.26). Later complications, hospitalizations, mortality, and time on PD did not differ significantly between groups. Peritonitis, poor education, and hospitalization were associated with dropout.ConclusionAlthough initiating PD within 72 h of catheter insertion was associated with more mechanical complications in our study, it resulted in similar clinical outcomes to Planned-start PD patients within the first 6 months of therapy, making it a viable option for urgent dialysis initiation in kidney failure patients."

The subtle onset and progression of OIRD can delay detection, potentially leading to cardiorespiratory collapse within minutes. A 55-year-old opioid-naïve male who underwent emergency surgery for abdominal penetrating trauma and unstable pelvic fracture. Postoperatively, despite sufentanil-based patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA), the patient experienced persistent moderate-to-severe pain. After acute pain service adjustment of PCIA parameters, the patient developed sudden unconsciousness with respiratory depression (respiratory rate, 7 breaths/min), hypoxemia (SpO2, 90%), bilateral 2-mm pinpoint pupils with sluggish reflexes, and generalized rigidity, despite no additional PCIA activations. The critical care team promptly recognized the signs of opioid-induced wooden-chest syndrome, a rare and severe form of OIRD and implemented targeted interventions. Initial administration of naloxone failed to reverse symptoms. The patient required urgent endotracheal intubation, during which marked chest wall rigidity was observed. These timely interventions enabled the successful rescue of the patient, who was transferred back to a general nursing unit on postoperative day 2. This case of OIRD due to opioid-induced wooden-chest syndrome underscores the danger of omitting dose titration in opioid-naïve patients. We therefore advocate for vigilant monitoring, strict titration protocols, and enhanced staff training to manage such emergencies."

    "abstract": "Gallbladder torsion (GT) is a rare cause of acute abdominal pain. Due to its rarity and nonspecific clinical presentation, GT is frequently misdiagnosed preoperatively. We report 2 cases of GT in patients initially suspected of acute appendicitis, both presenting with right lower abdominal pain. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical and radiological findings in these 2 patients to enhance our understanding of and management for this condition. Case 1 was a thin 80-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital with migration of pain to the right lower quadrant, persisting for 3 days. Case 2 was a thin 84-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital with right-sided abdominal pain that had persisted for over 20 hours. Emergency abdominal ultrasound examination revealed a low-lying gallbladder in case 2 and an enlarged gallbladder with a small amount of perigallbladder fluid collection in both patients. Non-contrast computed tomography revealed an enlarged gallbladder with disrupted gallbladder mucosa in both cases. In addition, the first case exhibited a whirlpool structure in the cystic duct region, alongside a pedicled hyperdense structure located between the neck of the gallbladder and the liver bed. In the second case, a strip-like structure was observed within the cystic duct area. Postoperative pathology confirmed acute gangrenous cholecystitis in both patients' gallbladders and acute simple appendicitis in their appendices. Both patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Both patients recovered well and were discharged within 1 week. GT presenting with appendicitis-like symptoms is relatively uncommon. For thin elderly female patients presenting with signs related to appendicitis, the possibility of GT should be considered. Non-contrast computed tomography is valuable for diagnosing GT."

    "abstract": "Background and Clinical Significance: The pathology of the round ligament (RL) is rare and often remains in the shadow of common surgical emergencies. The preoperative diagnosis is challenging, leaving the surgeon perplexed as to whether and when to operate. The presented case deserves attention due to the difficult decision to operate based solely on the clinical picture, despite negative imaging diagnostic results. Case presentation: A 76-year-old woman was admitted to the Emergency Department with 6 h complaints of epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. She was afebrile with stable vital signs. The abdomen was slightly tender in the epigastrium, without rebound tenderness or guarding. The following blood variables were beyond the normal range: WBC-13.5 × 109/L; total bilirubin 26 mmol/L; amylase-594 U/L; CRP 11.4 mg/L; ASAT-158 U/L; and ALAT-95 U/L. The ultrasound (US) and multislice computed tomography (MSCT) of the abdomen were normal. A working diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was established, and intravenous infusions were initiated. The next day, the patient became hemodynamically unstable with blood pressure 80/60 mm Hg, heart rate 130/min, chills and fever of 39.5 °C, and oliguria. There was remarkable guarding and rebound tenderness in the epigastrium. The blood analysis revealed the following: WBC-9.9 × 109/L; total bilirubin-76 µmol/L; direct bilirubin-52 µmol/L; amylase-214 U/L; CRP 245 mg/L; ASAT-161 U/L; ALAT-132 U/L; GGT-272 U/L; urea-15.7 mmol/L; and creatinine-2.77 mg/dL. She was taken to the operating room for exploration, which revealed local peritonitis and phlegmon of the RL. Resection of the RL was performed. The microbiological analysis showed Klebsiella varicola. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the 5th postoperative day. In the next months, the patients had several readmissions due to mild cholestasis and pancreatitis. The magnetic resonance demonstrated a duodenal diverticulum adjacent to the papilla, located near the junction of the common bile and pancreatic duct. This clinical manifestation and the location of the diverticulum were suggestive of Lemmel's syndrome, but a papillary dysfunction attributed to the diverticulum or food stasis cannot be excluded. Conclusion: To our knowledge, we report the first association between RL gangrene and Lemmel's syndrome. We speculate that duodenal diverticulitis with lymphatic spread of the infection or transient bacteriemia in the bile with bacterial translocation due to papillary dysfunction, as well as cholestasis resulting from the diverticulum, could be plausible and unreported causes of the RL infection. The preoperative diagnosis of RL gangrene is challenging because it resembles the most common emergency conditions in the upper abdomen. The present case warrants attention due to the difficult decision to operate based solely on the clinical picture, despite negative imaging results. A high index of suspicion should be maintained in a case of unexplained septic shock and epigastric tenderness, even in negative imaging findings. MSCT, however, is a valuable tool to avert unnecessary operations in conditions that must be managed conservatively, such as acute pancreatitis."

    "abstract": "Duodenal diverticulum (DD) perforation is a rare but severe clinical emergency with a reported mortality rate as high as 30%. DD most commonly occurs in the second portion of the duodenum (D2), particularly in the periampullary region, accounting for 78.3% of cases. In contrast, diverticula in the third portion of the duodenum (D3) are relatively rare. Traditional treatment methods include conservative therapy, percutaneous drainage, and surgical intervention. However, with advancements in gastrointestinal endoscopy, endoscopic treatment has emerged as a viable option. A 71-year-old male patient presented with upper abdominal pain. Laboratory tests revealed elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels. Abdominal CT showed a perforated diverticulum in D3 with a suspected foreign body. After 5 days of conservative treatment with no improvement, endoscopic intervention was performed. Using a gastroscope equipped with a transparent cap, foreign body forceps, the embedded chicken bone and surrounding debris were removed, and the fistula was closed with metallic clips. Follow-up CT scans showed significant improvement, with no recurrence of symptoms at 18 months. The successful endoscopic treatment of this D3 diverticulum perforation highlights the potential of endoscopic therapy in managing complex duodenal diseases. Compared to traditional surgery, endoscopic treatment offers minimal invasiveness, faster recovery, and fewer complications. This case expands the application of endoscopic techniques to D3 perforations, providing valuable experience for future similar cases."

This study assessed the diagnostic accuracy of POCUS in identifying the most common causes of acute abdominal pain, i.e., appendicitis, cholecystitis, bowel obstruction, and renal colic, presenting in an emergency setting. This prospective observational study was conducted over 12 months at Mardan Medical Complex and District Headquarters (DHQ) Teaching Hospital, Gujranwala, Pakistan. A total of 180 adult patients (≥18 years) presenting with non-traumatic acute abdominal pain were enrolled using convenience sampling. POCUS was performed by trained emergency physicians in accordance with American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) guidelines. Final diagnoses were confirmed through radiological, surgical, or clinical outcomes. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Statistical measures included sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnostic accuracy. The mean age of the patients was 39.5 ± 13.6 years (range: 18-80 years), with a slightly higher male predominance: 94 (52.2%) males and 86 (47.8%) females. The most common final diagnoses were appendicitis (44, 24.4%), renal colic (34, 18.9%), cholecystitis (30, 16.7%), and bowel obstruction (28, 15.6%). POCUS correctly identified the pathology in 150 (83.3%) cases. Condition-specific diagnostic accuracies were appendicitis at 92.2%, cholecystitis at 93.7%, bowel obstruction at 94.2%, and renal colic at 93.9%. Cases with nonspecific or unidentifiable abdominal pain were grouped under \"Other\" and not stratified further. Gender-based accuracy was comparable, with 79 (84.0%) correct diagnoses in males and 71 (82.6%) in females. POCUS demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for four of the most common abdominal emergencies, i.e., appendicitis, cholecystitis, bowel obstruction, and renal colic, and showed consistent performance across genders. While these findings support the role of POCUS as a valuable tool in emergency settings, particularly in resource-constrained environments, they should be interpreted within the study's scope. Broader generalization to all causes of abdominal pain requires further research with larger, more diverse patient populations and long-term follow-up."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common presentation in most emergency departments, and the presence of appendiceal fecolith on CT is indicative of earlier progression to complicated disease. This study aimed to assess the association between appendiceal fecoliths identified on preoperative computed tomography (CT) and the severity of appendicitis, using integrated clinical, radiological, surgical, and histopathological data. We conducted a retrospective observational study of 529 adult appendicectomy patients diagnosed with acute appendicitis via CT between 2010 and 2020 at two tertiary hospitals in Sydney, Australia. Patients were stratified into two groups based on the presence or absence of an appendiceal fecolith on CT. Demographics, inflammatory markers, imaging features, operative findings, and histopathological outcomes were compared. An appendiceal fecolith was identified on CT in 18.1% (n = 96) of patients. Baseline demographics and symptom duration were similar between groups. However, the fecolith group had significantly elevated inflammatory markers (CRP: 66.8 ± 9.0 vs. 45.5 ± 3.0 mg/L, p = 0.014; WBC count: 14.4 ± 0.4 vs. 12.4 ± 0.2 × 109/L p < 0.001), greater appendiceal diameter on CT (12.8 ± 0.4 vs. 10.0 ± 0.2 mm, p < 0.001), and a higher incidence of perforation (28.1% vs. 8.8%, p < 0.001). Postoperative length of stay was also prolonged in the fecolith group (54.7 ± 4.6 vs. 42.4 ± 2.2 h, p = 0.008). Despite similar time to surgery, the fecolith group had more frequent complications. The presence of an appendiceal fecolith on preoperative CT is strongly associated with increased disease severity, including higher rates of perforation, elevated inflammatory markers, and longer hospitalization. Clinicians should consider appendiceal fecoliths as a marker of complicated appendicitis and consider early surgical intervention in this subgroup."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency, however endometriosis in an appendix is a rare phenomenon. In this case report, we describe a 34-year-old woman who visited a teaching hospital on 2024, presenting with typical clinical features of appendicitis. Initial imaging revealed complicated appendicitis with perforation and an appendicolith; following conservative management, the patient was scheduled for an interval appendectomy which revealed an appendicular mass. A repeat surgery was scheduled, where extensive adhesions were noted, resulting in an open appendectomy. Histopathological examination confirmed appendiceal Endometriosis and a follow-up by a gynaecologist was arranged. Appendiceal Endometriosis is a rare phenomenon with variable clinical presentations, a high index of suspicion is necessary for women of childbearing age due to the risk of complications. The diagnosis of appendiceal Endometriosis is only confirmed via histopathology, and obtaining a Magnetic Resonance Imaging might aid in diagnosis; however, prompt surgical intervention is the standard of care."

    "abstract": "Mitral annular subvalvular aneurysm (MASA) is a rare cardiac condition with variable etiology and potentially life-threatening complications. A 35-year-old previously healthy man of African descent presented with progressive dyspnea and weight loss. Multimodality imaging revealed a posterior MASA complicated by leaflet perforation, left atrium-to-left ventricle fistula, and severe mitral regurgitation. Despite negative microbiological and histological results, morphological and intraoperative findings strongly suggested healed infective endocarditis rather than a congenital origin. Urgent mitral valve replacement with aneurysm exclusion was successfully performed. This case highlights the diagnostic and surgical value of multimodality imaging-including echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography, and magnetic resonance-in confirming MASA and supporting an acquired inflammatory etiology when infectious work-up is inconclusive. MASA secondary to healed endocarditis should be suspected in the presence of leaflet perforation, atrioventricular fistula, and severe mitral regurgitation. Comprehensive multimodality imaging is essential for diagnosis and surgical planning."

    "abstract": "Bowel obstruction is a critical emergency. Although imaging like X-ray and computed tomography (CT) aids diagnosis, cost-effective hematological biomarkers are still needed. This study evaluates the diagnostic values of hematological biomarkers for detecting complications, determining the need for surgery, and predicting prognosis in patients with bowel obstruction. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. We systematically searched Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Embase and Cochrane Library for studies published up to June 2025. Inclusion criteria encompassed observational or case-control studies reporting sensitivity/specificity of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), D-dimer, or lactate in bowel obstruction outcomes. Data extraction included true/false, positives/negatives, cutoff values, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) parameters. Bivariate models pooled sensitivity/specificity, while summary ROC curves and Youden index determined optimal thresholds. This study included 34 articles comprising a total of 5871 patients. CRP at a cutoff of 26.91 mg/L (Youden index: 0.97) for diagnosing bowel ischemia showed pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.80 and 0.92, respectively, with a summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91. PCT in determining the need for surgery achieved a cutoff of 0.12 ng/mL (Youden index: 0.8), with sensitivity and specificity of 0.75 and 0.74 (AUC: 0.79). NLR showed a cutoff of 7.2 (Youden index: 0.68), yielding sensitivity and specificity of 0.74 and 0.83 (AUC: 0.84) in the diagnosis of bowel ischemia. D-dimer (cutoff: 1.72 mg/L, Youden index: 0.91) and lactate (cutoff: 2.98 mmol/L, Youden index: 0.8) exhibited sensitivities of 0.83 and 0.77, specificities of 0.70 and 0.79, and AUCs of 0.85 for both, in the diagnosis of bowel ischemia. NLR, CRP, PCT, D-dimer, and lactate may provide supplementary diagnostic value for bowel ischemia in patients with bowel obstruction. A PCT threshold > 0.12 ng/mL may assist in evaluating the need for surgery."

    "abstract": "Sigmoid volvulus is a rare cause of bowel obstruction in young adults and is classically seen in elderly males. In woman of reproductive age, sigmoid volvulus is easily misdiagnosed as a gynecologic emergency, which will contribute to delayed recognition and increased morbidity. Reports of sigmoid volvulus in healthy young females without predisposing factors remain extremely limited in literature. Against this backdrop of established knowledge, we present a unique case that challenges the typical demographic profile of sigmoid volvulus. We report a case of a 25-year-old previously healthy Ethiopian woman who presented with progressive abdominal distension, colicky pain, and obstipation. No predisposing anatomic or systemic factors were identified. Despite the absence of advanced imaging modalities such as computed tomography or endoscopy, a clinical suspicion of sigmoid volvulus was raised on the basis of examination findings and the plane abdominal radiography demonstrating the classic \"coffee bean\" sign. She underwent successful rigid sigmoidoscopic decompression with no complications and remains recurrence free on follow-up. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for sigmoid volvulus in young women presenting with abdominal complaints, even in the absence of typical risk factors. It also illustrates that accurate diagnosis and effective treatment are achieved using basic clinical tools in resource-limited settings, which emphasizes on the role of clinical acumen and basic radiographic tools in resource-limited settings. Clinicians must be aware of this rare but important differential to avoid misattribution to gynecologic conditions and ensure timely intervention."

Early risk identification is essential for effective triage. Hematologic biomarkers may provide rapid, accessible tools for predicting disease severity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of hematologic parameters-particularly lymphocyte count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and immature granulocyte (IG) indices-for ICU admission and complicated appendicitis in elderly patients. This retrospective observational study included patients aged ≥65 years who underwent appendectomy for suspected acute appendicitis between 2018-2021 and in 2024 at a tertiary emergency department. Patients were grouped by ICU admission status and histopathological diagnosis (complicated vs. non-complicated appendicitis). Preoperative clinical and laboratory data were analyzed using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. A post hoc power analysis was also performed. Of 143 patients included, 33 (23.1%) required ICU admission. These patients were older and had higher rates of diabetes and coronary artery disease. Lymphocyte counts were significantly lower and NLR values higher in the ICU group. In multivariate analysis, only lymphocyte count independently predicted ICU admission. Complicated appendicitis was associated with age, diabetes, low lymphocyte count, high IG%, and elevated NLR in univariate analysis; however, only age, diabetes, and lymphocyte count remained significant in multivariate modeling. ROC analysis showed moderate diagnostic performance for lymphocyte count (area under the curve=0.669) in identifying complicated cases. Lymphopenia is an independent predictor of ICU admission and complicated appendicitis in elderly patients. Routine blood parameters may support early clinical risk stratification in emergency settings."

    "title": "Surgical approach to intraabdominal sepsis: a damage control approach can reduce stoma rates.",
    "abstract": "In patients with perforated diverticulitis and/or intraabdominal sepsis (IAS), the best surgical strategy remains controversial. While open, non-restorative Hartmann's procedure represents the procedure of choice in many centers, ostomy-sparing and minimally invasive techniques have been increasingly utilized due to short- and long-term benefits, including a reduced stoma rate. This dynamic manuscript illustrates strategic and technical considerations of the standardized institutional staged or damage control approach to IAS. The institutional strategy to IAS is demonstrated through an emergency procedure for perforated Hinchey IV diverticulitis in a 70-year-old woman developing an acute abdomen. After a diagnostic laparoscopy, stercoral peritonitis was confirmed and the patient underwent laparotomy. A two-stage approach (stage 1: damage control with resection of the perforated sigmoid, abdominal lavage, vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) - stage 2 (36-48 h later and during daytime): primary colorectal anastomosis and abdominal closure) was performed. While laparoscopic exploration represents the standard approach in hemodynamically stable patients, the staged procedure (resection and sepsis control) helped refine the definite strategy (goal of reconstruction and no ostomy) in a clinically improved patient during the second step. The patient recovered well during the critical therapeutic window, allowing to perform primary anastomosis and a stoma-free discharge. Clinical condition during surgery, surgeon expertise, and comorbidities are key determinants to decide whether to proceed to primary anastomosis in the case of IAS. An institutional series of our group revealed feasibility and safety of the staged approach, with 65% stoma-free patients at discharge. A standardized algorithm based on intraoperative hemodynamic parameters intends to guide surgical decision-making during staged procedures to seek optimized conditions allowing to proceed to primary anastomosis. A staged approach according to a predefined decisional framework may help decrease the need for ostomy creation in patients with IAS."

Infectious aortitis has been associated with various pathogens, although Escherichia coli has rarely been implicated. CASE REPORT We describe an 82-year-old man with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and ischemic heart disease, who presented with a 2-week history of back and abdominal pain. Imaging revealed aortitis with a periaortic fluid collection, from which E. coli was isolated. The patient underwent urgent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and was treated with 4 weeks of intravenous cefuroxime followed by prolonged oral antibiotics, with normalization of inflammatory markers. Four months later he was readmitted because of septic shock and a large periaortic abscess was diagnosed. He required open drainage and aortic repair and died of complications. We review the literature of 33 cases involving E. coli aortitis, including the present case, of whom the mean age was 69±11, 26 (79%) were male, 31 (94%) were diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) scan, and 27/31 (87%) received surgical intervention. Further, 25 out of 30 patients (83%) for whom all data regarding interventions and survival were available, survived. CONCLUSIONS Aortitis due to E.coli is a potentially fatal infection. Treatment consists preferably of a combination of prolonged intravenous antibiotics - for at least 6 to 12 weeks - and a surgical intervention. If possible, the patient should undergo EVAR, and if not, open corrective surgery, which is associated with a survival rate of 83%."

A periappendiceal infiltrate is a complicated form of the acute appendicitis, identified by creation of an inflammatory mass of the tissue and organs of the abdominal cavity. The goals of our study were to identify patients diagnosed with a periappendiceal infiltrate, who were initially treated conservatively, evaluate the effectivity of such treatment, and compare our findings with both Czech and foreign literature. A retrospective data analysis regarding patients with a conservatively treated periapendiceal infiltrate and/or abscess in our hospital during a five-year period (January 2020 - December 2024) and comparison of the results with Czech and foreign literature. The number of patients with acute appendicitis in this period was 433, of which 13 (3.0%) were treated initially conservatively with intravenous antibiotics and were diagnosed with a periappendiceal infiltrate using imaging methods. There were 9 males (69.2%) and 4 females (30.8%), the average age was 57.7 years. A CT scan was initially performed in 12 of the patients (92.3%), 8 (61.5%) were found to have an abscess and 6 of the abscesses were treated via a CT-guided drainage. Twelve of the patients (92.3%) were treated successfully and without recurrence. Interval appendectomy was performed in 4 patients (30.8%). Despite our study being limited in the number of patients, its results are coherent with the trend seen in foreign publications - the conservative approach using intravenous antibiotics with or without a CT-guided drainage is an adequate and effective treatment in patients with a periapendiceal infiltrate."

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up until February 2025 for studies involving patients presenting to the paediatric emergency department with suspected appendicitis, who underwent POCUS. Studies were assessed for risk of bias using the Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies framework. The primary outcome of interest was the ability of POCUS to detect appendicitis in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Eight studies were included encompassing 993 patients. Calculated pooled sensitivity was 85.6% (95% CI 68.9% to 94.1%) with a specificity of 90.2% (95% CI 86.5% to 93.0%). There was a wide range of reported sensitivities for POCUS, ranging from 53% to 100%. There was less variation in reported specificities that ranged from 82% to 95.2%. The studies analysed were of variable quality with the reference standard and flow and timing being the main areas subject to bias. Based on the findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that POCUS can be used as an effective tool to diagnose paediatric appendicitis. With a moderately high sensitivity, it may not be recommended to be used to exclude appendicitis based on POCUS findings alone. Further prospective studies evaluating the reliability of POCUS in excluding appendicitis, either alone or when combined with a clinical prediction rule, are required. Secondary findings from this study demonstrate that POCUS may result in a reduced length of stay in the paediatric emergency department and lead to a reduction in CT utilisation, though insufficient data were available to draw firm conclusions in relation to this."

    "abstract": "Background: Antibiotics and appendectomy are the mainstays of therapy for acute appendicitis, but wide variation exists in antibiotic choice, duration, and guideline adherence. Despite recommendations favoring narrow-spectrum agents, broad-spectrum antibiotic use remains high. This multi-site quality improvement initiative aimed to implement a standardized care pathway to improve antibiotic stewardship. Methods: A multi-disciplinary task force developed and implemented an evidence-based pathway across six hospitals within a large health system. Data were compared for patients treated 12 months before and after implementation. The primary outcome was empirical broad- versus narrow-spectrum antibiotic use. Secondary outcomes included duration of therapy and balancing measures such as length of stay, 30-day readmission, and cost. Results: Among 1,279 patients with acute appendicitis (619 pre- and 660 post-intervention), empirical narrow-spectrum use increased significantly (14.2%-18.5%, p = 0.04), with corresponding decreases in broad-spectrum use (82.1%-78.2%, p = 0.09). Statistical process control charts revealed special cause variation, including sustained increases in narrow-spectrum prescribing. Clinical outcomes were unchanged: no differences were observed in length of stay (1.5 d [IQR: 0.9-2.8] versus 1.6 d [IQR: 0.9-2.9]; p = 0.62), 30-day readmission (7.9% vs. 7.1%, p = 0.60), infection-related readmission (1.1% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.57), or technical direct cost ($4,700 [IQR: $3,712-$6,680] versus $4,559 [IQR: $3,470-$6,759]; p = 0.183). Conclusion: A standardized care pathway significantly improved antibiotic selection for acute appendicitis without negatively impacting outcomes or costs. This initiative illustrates the feasibility of scalable, evidence-informed interventions to promote stewardship across diverse clinical settings."

    "abstract": "Background Peptic ulcer perforation (PUP) is a life-threatening complication of peptic ulcer disease (PUD), with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in low-resource settings. Driven by factors such as Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) use, and socio-economic disparities, PUP requires urgent surgical intervention. This study investigates clinical characteristics, risk factors, and surgical outcomes of PUP in a tribal predominant tertiary care hospital in India. Methods This analytical cross-sectional study enrolled 82 patients undergoing emergency surgery for PUP at a tertiary care centre in Ranchi, India. Patients aged >18 years with confirmed or suspected PUP were included, excluding those with sealed perforation. Data on demographics, clinical presentation, H. pylori status, surgical procedures, and outcomes were collected. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-square and Fisher's exact tests, with multivariate logistic regression to identify mortality predictors. Results Of 82 patients, 84.14% were male, 47.56% aged 18-40 years, and 41.47% from lower socio-economic classes. Duodenal perforations (48.78%) were most common, with 82.5% testing positive for H. pylori (p<0.0001). Delayed presentation (>48 hours) increased mortality risk [Odds Ratio (OR)=3.50, p=0.004], with 22.44% mortality. Perforation size of >2 cm (OR=3; p=0.010)and severe anaemia (OR=2.90; p=0.013) were significant mortality predictors. Graham's patch (n=46) had three cases of postoperative anastomotic leak, although not statistically significant (p=0.282). Complications included pleural effusion (24.39%) and surgical site infection (13.42%), with 13.42% overall mortality. Conclusion PUP remains a significant burden in India, driven by delayed presentation, size of perforation, and presence of severe anaemia. Early presentation of symptoms, early surgical intervention, and management of anaemia are crucial to improving outcomes."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are rare mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, typically diagnosed in older adults. Jejunal GISTs with spontaneous perforation leading to acute peritonitis are uncommon, particularly in young individuals. We report the case of a 32-year-old male who presented with acute abdominal pain, vomiting, and peritoneal signs. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed pneumoperitoneum and a heterogeneously enhancing mass at the jejunoileal junction, raising suspicion for a perforated GIST. Emergency exploratory laparotomy confirmed a 6 × 6 cm perforated tumor on the antimesenteric border of the jejunum, which was resected with primary anastomosis. Histopathology confirmed a high-grade spindle-cell GIST with increased mitotic activity. The patient recovered well postoperatively and started on adjuvant imatinib therapy following oncological consultation. A four-week post-discharge positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) scan showed no residual disease or metastasis. Perforated jejunal GISTs are rare and carry a high risk of recurrence and poor prognosis if not promptly managed. Surgical resection remains the cornerstone of treatment, with adjuvant tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy recommended for high-risk cases. Given the aggressive nature of perforated GISTs, long-term surveillance is essential. This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention in perforated jejunal GISTs, particularly in younger patients. Multidisciplinary management with adjuvant therapy and rigorous follow-up is crucial to optimizing outcomes."

    "abstract": "Acute abdominal pain accounts for 7-10% of all emergency department visits. Appendicitis, being one of the leading causes of acute abdominal surgery, poses significant diagnostic challenges. Negative appendectomy rates can be as high as 40%, while complications occur in more than 90% if the diagnosis is missed during the initial examination. Therefore, more effective preoperative screening is required for patients with suspected appendicitis. Recent studies suggest that novel biomarkers, particularly leucine-rich alpha 2-glycoprotein and calprotectin, may improve the early and accurate diagnosis of acute appendicitis by demonstrating high specificity and sensitivity, respectively. Unlike C-reactive protein, the production of leucine-rich alpha 2-glycoprotein 1 and calprotectin takes place at the site of inflammation. As a result, their raised concentrations might be evident early in a disease, possibly before other common markers of inflammation start to rise. This literature review aims to assess the potential role of leucine-rich alpha 2-glycoprotein 1 and calprotectin as diagnostic biomarkers in patients with suspected acute appendicitis, acknowledging the need for additional data to fully assess their diagnostic accuracy."

This study explored the role of the immature granulocyte count (IG#) and percentage (IG%) as accessible and reliable biomarkers to enhance the diagnostic precision of CA. This retrospective observational study analyzed 482 emergency appendectomies performed at a single tertiary hospital between January 2020 and June 2023. After excluding 23 cases due to haematological disorders, malignancies, additional procedures, or incomplete data, 459 patients were included in the final analysis. Patients were categorized into the UA and CA groups based on histopathological examination. CA was defined as a perforation or gangrene. Laboratory parameters, including IG#, IG%, and inflammatory markers, were compared between groups. Among the 459 patients, 386 (84.1%) had UA and 73 (15.9%) had CA. The median age of CA patients was significantly higher than that of UA patients (36 vs. 33 years, p = 0.016). CA patients also demonstrated significantly elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), direct bilirubin, white blood cell count (WBC), IG#, IG%, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) compared to UA patients (p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified an IG# cut-off of 0.06 (area under the ROC curve [AUROC] = 0.699, sensitivity = 68.5%, specificity = 65.2%) and an IG% cut-off of 0.35 (AUROC = 0.663, sensitivity = 75.3%, specificity = 49.6%). In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, none of the evaluated laboratory parameters, including WBC count (Odds ratio (OR): 1.133, 95% Confidence interval (CI): 0.979-1.313, p = 0.095), IG# (OR: 0.000, 95% CI: 0.000-1.595, p = 0.056), IG% (OR: 6.740, 95% CI: 0.873-52.064, p = 0.067), and NLR (OR: 1.070, 95% CI: 0.980-1.169, p = 0.131), remained significant independent predictors of CA. Elevated IG# and IG% levels were associated with CA in univariate analysis; however, they did not remain significant independent predictors in the multivariable model. Although the potential of these markers may still provide complementary information in certain clinical scenarios, further large-scale prospective studies are needed to better define their role in clinical practice."

A 57-year-old female with a history of biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) underwent CP for inadequate weight loss. She presented one year later with acute abdominal pain and fever. Diagnostic imaging and laparoscopy confirmed an internal hernia. Treatment involved lysis of adhesions, hernia reduction, and closure of mesenteric defects. The patient had an uneventful recovery and remained symptom-free during follow-up. The patient presented with acute abdominal pain and fever one year after undergoing the CP. Laboratory tests revealed elevated white blood cell count (11,780/mm3) and lactate levels (3.6 mmol/L), with normal inflammatory markers. CT imaging showed signs of small bowel obstruction and a swirl sign consistent with internal hernia. Emergency laparoscopy confirmed herniation through an inframesenteric defect. The procedure was converted to open laparotomy for safe hernia reduction and mesenteric defect closure. The patient recovered without complications and was discharged on postoperative day three. At follow-up, she remained symptom-free. Internal hernia is a potential complication after CP, similar to Roux-en-Y reconstructions. Prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention are critical to avoiding severe complications like bowel infarction."

Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including 188 ICU patients with alcohol-related cirrhosis who were treated for ACLF at a tertiary university medical center. ACLF was defined and graded according to the European Association for the Study of the Liver-Chronic Liver Failure Consortium (EASL-CLIF) criteria, and sepsis was diagnosed according to Sepsis-3 definitions. Clinical data, precipitating events, microbiological evidence, organ support requirements, and in-hospital outcomes were systematically analyzed. Results: Sepsis was the most frequent precipitating event, identified in 118 patients (62.8%), while 70 patients (37.2%) developed ACLF due to non-septic triggers such as gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with sepsis-associated ACLF presented with more advanced disease (ACLF grade 2-3 in 80.5% vs. 57.1%, p = 0.004), higher Chronic Liver Failure Consortium-Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure Score (CLIF-C ACLF) scores (median 55 vs. 50, p = 0.04), longer ICU stays (median 11 vs. 4.5 days, p < 0.001), and markedly higher in-hospital mortality (60.2% vs. 20.0%, p < 0.001) compared to patients without sepsis. Pneumonia (48.3%), urinary infections (17.8%) and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (16.1%) were the leading infectious foci triggering sepsis. Microbiological evidence was obtained in 82.2% of sepsis cases, with frequent polymicrobial infections and opportunistic pathogens including Enterococcus faecium and Candida albicans. Conclusions: In critically ill patients with alcohol-related cirrhosis, infections leading to sepsis are the predominant precipitating event of ACLF and the strongest determinant of short-term prognosis. Compared with non-sepsis triggers, sepsis-associated ACLF is characterized by more severe disease, greater need for organ support, longer ICU stays, and substantially higher mortality. These findings highlight the urgent need for early recognition, rapid diagnostic strategies, and optimized infection management to improve outcomes in this high-risk population."

    "title": "Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Colorectal Cancer Surgery: Surgical Outcomes and Tumor Characteristics in a Multicenter Retrospective Cohort.",
    "abstract": "Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare systems globally, raising concerns about delays in CRC diagnosis and treatment, and their potential negative effects on surgical outcomes. However, the extent of this impact remains uncertain. Aim: To compare the clinical characteristics, treatment strategies, and outcomes of CRC patients between the Pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 Era groups, and to identify independent predictors of metastasis and mortality. Methods: This retrospective multicenter study included 397 CRC patients who underwent surgical treatment between 1 July 2018, and 1 August 2021, at three tertiary medical centers. Patients were divided into two groups: Pre-COVID-19 (n = 213) and COVID-19 Era (n = 184). Demographic data, tumor characteristics, surgical approach, postoperative complications, and survival outcomes were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify independent predictors of metastasis and mortality. Results: The median age was 64 years (95% CI: 63-66), with 59.2% being male. Compared to the Pre-COVID-19 group, patients in the COVID-19 Era had significantly larger tumors (p < 0.001), with a significantly higher total LN retrieved (p = 0.006), more advanced T-stage (p = 0.007), higher N2 lymph node involvement (p = 0.027), and poorer tumor differentiation (p = 0.030). Intestinal perforation was more frequent in the Pre-COVID-19 group (p = 0.042). Multivariate analysis revealed increased odds of mortality associated with the positive LN retrieved (OR: 1.14; p = 0.001), moderate tumor differentiation (OR: 2.99; p = 0.043), poor differentiation (OR: 4.57; p = 0.023), undifferentiated histology (OR: 6.95; p = 0.028), intestinal obstruction (OR: 2.67; p = 0.007), intestinal perforation (OR: 11.76; p < 0.001), and distant metastasis (OR: 2.86; p = 0.008). Regarding metastasis, elevated preoperative CEA (OR: 1.02; p = 0.002), lymph node involvement (OR: 4.87; p = 0.002), and perineural invasion (OR: 2.17; p = 0.033) were independently associated with increased odds of metastasis. Conclusions: Although overall survival did not differ significantly between groups, patients treated during the COVID-19 Era exhibited more advanced histopathological characteristics, including a higher proportion of T4 tumors, increased N2 lymph node involvement, and poorer differentiation grades. Despite no significant differences in postoperative complications between groups, it is noteworthy that preoperative intestinal perforation was less frequent in the COVID-19 Era cohort."

    "title": "Enteroenteric Fistula Following Multiple Magnet Ingestion in an Adult: Case Report, Literature Review and Management Algorithm.",
    "abstract": "Background: Multiple high-powered magnet ingestion is a surgical emergency due to inter-loop attraction leading to ischemia, necrosis, perforation, and fistula formation. While well documented in children, adult cases-particularly those complicated by entero-enteric fistula-remain rare, and management is largely extrapolated from pediatric guidelines. Objective: To present a rare case of adult entero-enteric fistula following multiple neodymium magnet ingestion, we review the literature and propose an adapted management algorithm for adults. Methods: A narrative PubMed review was performed to identify pediatric and adult cases of magnet ingestion complicated by gastrointestinal fistula. Search terms included magnet ingestion, entero-enteric fistula, neodymium, and adult. Reported case characteristics, diagnostic modalities, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed. Results: A 38-year-old male with schizophrenia presented with small bowel obstruction five days after ingesting multiple magnets. Abdominal radiography revealed clustered radiopaque bodies in the distal ileum. Emergency laparotomy identified an entero-enteric fistula caused by pressure necrosis from inter-loop magnetic attraction. Segmental enterectomy with side-to-side anastomosis was performed, with uneventful recovery. The literature review identified only a few adult cases, which showed similar pathophysiology but frequent diagnostic delays and higher complication rates compared with pediatric cases. Conclusions: This case adds to the scarce adult literature on magnet-induced entero-enteric fistula and supports the adaptation of pediatric-based protocols for adults, with attention paid to psychiatric comorbidity and delayed presentation. Early imaging, timely intervention, and multidisciplinary care are essential to prevent severe gastrointestinal injury."

    "abstract": "Several studies have advocated for nonoperative management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis, given its favorable safety profile. However, the paucity of data regarding the long-term failure rates of nonoperative management imposes limitations on shared clinical decision-making with patients and families. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing operative and nonoperative management of acute uncomplicated appendicitis in children (PROSPERO CRD42021270347). Single- or double-arm studies published in MEDLINE and EMBASE between 2000 and 2024 were included. Our primary outcome was nonoperative management failure rate at 1 year, defined as patients who returned with recurrent appendicitis, need for exploratory surgery for abdominal pain, or elective interval appendectomy. Secondary outcomes were rates of 30-day emergency department visits and 1-year readmissions. Initial search yielded 2,249 articles, of which 48 articles were included. One-year mean failure rate was 22.3% (95% confidence interval, 21.7-23.0%), and beyond 1 year was 54.2% (95% confidence interval, 41.4-67.0%). Patients who underwent nonoperative management were more likely to visit the emergency department within 30 days and be readmitted within 1 year compared with those who underwent surgery. Our findings demonstrate a 1-year nonoperative management failure rate of more than 20% and more than 50% beyond 1 year. Patients undergoing nonoperative management returned to the emergency department and required readmission more frequently than patients whose acute uncomplicated appendicitis was treated operatively."

    "abstract": "The clinical burden of colorectal cancer (CRC) is high. Population-based screening and early detection are essential to improve the long-term clinical outcome. Nonetheless, a significant proportion of patients still present at an advanced stage, including with acute large bowel obstruction. Image-enhanced endoscopy and artificial intelligence can improve the detection and diagnosis of colonic adenomas and early cancer. Endoscopic resection is regarded as the preferred curative treatment option for colonic adenoma and T0 and T1 CRC limited to the superficial submucosa. Emergency colonic stenting as bridge to interval curative surgery is increasingly accepted as a first-line option when technically feasible. Minimally invasive resection techniques such as laparoscopic colectomy and robot-assisted colorectal surgery have also come of age. These techniques reduce post-treatment morbidity, shorten the recovery process and can be cost-effective while maintaining long-term oncological cure. These outcome measures are relevant to our patients; therefore, minimally invasive approaches to curative resection should be embraced."

    "abstract": "Right iliac fossa (RIF) pain is a frequent and challenging presenting complaint in emergency departments, encompassing a wide spectrum of acute and chronic conditions. To compare effectiveness of ultrasound versus initial clinical and lab tests for diagnosing acute appendicitis in patients with RIF pain, while also evaluating the impact of ultrasound operator experience as well as portable ultrasound system. This retrospective study included 525 patients (aged ≥15 years) presenting with acute RIF pain to three emergency departments in Thi-Qar Governorate, Iraq (January 2024-January 2025). Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values (PPV and NPV), and accuracy for diagnosing acute appendicitis were calculated. Multivariable logistic regression identified independent predictors of diagnostic accuracy for both modalities. Among 525 patients, appendicitis was the final diagnosis in 273 (52.00%). For diagnosing acute appendicitis, ultrasound demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity (89.7% vs 67.4%), specificity (67.1% vs 46.4%), and overall accuracy (78.9% vs 57.3%) compared to clinical-laboratory assessment. Independent predictors of higher ultrasound accuracy included US operator experience (Senior EM Physician vs. Resident: aOR 3.15, 95% CI: 1.80-5.52) and presence of rebound tenderness (aOR 2.40, 95% CI: 1.35-4.27). For clinical-laboratory assessment, ED physician experience (Senior vs. Resident: aOR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.15-2.41) was one of the independent predictors of higher accuracy. Ultrasound significantly outperforms initial clinical-laboratory assessment in diagnosing acute appendicitis among patients with RIF pain in this setting. US operator experience is a key determinant of ultrasound accuracy. Our findings support the effective use of portable ultrasound systems in the emergency setting."

    "title": "Retro-Appendicular Internal Hernia: A Rare Cause of Small Bowel Obstruction.",
    "abstract": "Internal hernias are rare causes of small bowel obstruction and are often difficult to diagnose preoperatively. Retro-appendicular internal hernias are exceedingly rare, with very few reports in the literature. This case is noteworthy for involving a patient with no prior history of abdominal surgery, highlighting an unusual presentation of a retro-appendicular internal hernia. A man in his mid-60s, with no history of abdominal surgery, presented to the emergency department with acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed localized peritonism, and laboratory results were unremarkable. CT showed signs of small bowel distension with segmental hypoperfusion of the bowel loop in the right lower quadrant. Given the clinical presentation of an acute abdomen, the patient underwent exploratory laparoscopy, which revealed a herniation of the small intestine into the retro-appendicular space. The herniated bowel appeared ischemic but was successfully reduced without further need for resection. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery. This case underscores the importance of considering internal hernias in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen, even in patients without prior abdominal surgery. Awareness of rare anatomical variants such as retro-appendicular hernias is critical, as early surgical exploration can prevent bowel necrosis and reduce morbidity. This report contributes to the limited research literature on retro-appendicular internal hernias and emphasizes the value of maintaining a high index of suspicion in atypical presentations."

    "abstract": "Timely diagnosis of small bowel obstruction (SBO) is essential to prevent complications. While computed tomography (CT) is the gold standard for diagnosing SBO due to its high sensitivity and specificity, it has notable limitations, including radiation exposure, high cost, delayed diagnosis, and limited accessibility. Recently, ultrasound has gained attention as a potential alternative in emergency departments (ED) because it is radiation-free, cost-effective, and accessible. This multi-center study seeks to assess the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound in identifying SBO among patients presenting to the ED. This multicenter cross-sectional study included 100 patients with suspected SBO, examined by a trained ED physician using ultrasound and confirmed by CT. Ultrasound findings evaluated were excessive gas, bowel wall thickening, interloop free fluid, lumen diameter ≥2.5 cm, and decreased peristalsis. Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios were calculated for each finding. We found that the most efficient parameters were lumen size greater than 2.5 cm (efficacy: 73%, 95%CI: 63% - 81%), and a decrease in peristalsis (efficacy: 73%, 95%CI: 63% - 81%), The most specific parameters were excessive gas (specificity: 89%, 95%CI: 75% - 97%) and thickening of the bowel wall (specificity: 82%, 95%CI: 66% - 92%). The most sensitive parameters were interloop free fluid (sensitivity: 77%, 95%CI: 65% - 87%) and lumen diameter ≥ 2.5 cm (sensitivity: 77%, 95%CI: 65% - 87%) among other diagnostic findings. Ultrasound may be a useful diagnostic tool for SBO in the ED, offering a potentially efficient and accessible option for diagnosis."

    "title": "A Rare Surgical Case of Gallbladder Volvulus Masquerading as Acute Cholecystitis.",
    "abstract": "Gallbladder volvulus (GBV) is a rare and life-threatening condition characterized by the twisting of the gallbladder on its pedicle, resulting in obstruction of the cystic duct, artery, and vein. This leads to compromised blood flow, ischemia, and potentially severe complications, including necrosis or perforation. Although GBV shares clinical symptoms with acute cholecystitis, it requires urgent surgical intervention due to its rapid progression and severe consequences if left untreated. GBV predominantly affects elderly females and is often associated with anatomical variations that allow for increased mobility of the gallbladder, contributing to its torsion. An 84-year-old female presented with 24 hours of severe, diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Initial imaging suggested cholecystitis, prompting the placement of a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube. However, laparoscopic cholecystectomy revealed a torsed, hyperemic gallbladder with signs of ischemia, though no perforation was noted. The gallbladder was detorsed, and the cystic duct and artery were divided. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged on postoperative day one. GBV often presents with clinical features similar to acute cholecystitis, complicating diagnosis. Imaging, including ultrasonography and CT scans, may reveal thickened gallbladder walls and pericholecystic fluid, but the absence of gallstones and identification of atypical anatomical positioning can raise suspicion for GBV. Surgical treatment, particularly laparoscopic cholecystectomy, remains the gold standard for management. Early recognition and intervention are crucial to prevent gallbladder necrosis, perforation, and biliary peritonitis. This case underscores the importance of heightened clinical suspicion and timely intervention to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with GBV. GBV is a rare but serious cause of acute abdominal pain, particularly in elderly patients. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges and the critical role of early intervention in preventing severe complications. Accurate imaging and surgical treatment are essential for successful outcomes."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is a common surgical emergency in children and adolescents, yet its global epidemiological trends and burden remain understudied. This study aims to analyze the global burden of appendicitis in children aged 0-19 years from 1990 to 2021. We extracted data from the Global Burden of Disease 2021 study to analyze the incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to appendicitis. Age-standardized rates and trends were stratified by sex, age group, region, and Socio-demographic Index (SDI). In 2021, there were 4.53 million new cases of appendicitis and 360 249 DALYs among children and adolescents globally. The highest age-standardized incidence rate (270.38 [95% uncertainty interval {UI}, 180.93-386.54]) was observed in high-SDI regions, while the highest mortality rate (0.23 [95% UI, 0.14-0.35]) occurred in low-SDI regions. From 1990 to 2021, global age-standardized incidence and prevalence rates decreased slightly, while mortality and DALYs declined substantially. However, the age-standardized incidence and prevalence rates began increasing after 2015 and are projected to rise by over 21% by 2040. Frontier analysis highlighted strong performance in Somalia and Niger among low-SDI countries, whereas the United States Virgin Islands, a high-SDI region, exhibited considerable potential for improvement. The burden of appendicitis among children and adolescents remains significant, with pronounced inequalities across SDI levels. Addressing these inequities requires targeted interventions, such as improving surgical infrastructure in low-SDI regions and optimizing resource utilization in high-SDI regions. These findings provide a foundation for evidence-based policies to ensure equitable care for this vulnerable population."

    "title": "Seat Belt Injury Diagnosed as Perforation of the 4th Portion of the Duodenum Two Days after a Traffic Accident: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Car seat belts are safety devices that protect passengers during collisions in traffic accidents. However, seat belts can cause abdominal injuries during collisions. Many cases of injury to various intraperitoneal organs caused by seat belts have been reported, but reports of duodenal injury are relatively rare. In addition, diagnosing duodenal injury due to blunt trauma is not easy, and it is not uncommon for cases to be diagnosed long after injury. Here, we report a case in which a patient was diagnosed with perforation of the 4th portion of the duodenum 2 days after injury in a traffic accident. A 67-year-old woman was transported to our hospital after driving a car that collided with a wall. A seat belt mark was observed on her abdomen. A CT scan performed on the day of the injury confirmed a small poorly enhanced area in the duodenum, but no obvious signs of intestinal perforation were found. CT scan also revealed abdominal aortic dissection, a right clavicle fracture, and bilateral rib fractures. Two days later, a CT scan revealed expansion of the poorly enhanced area of the intestinal wall and a small amount of free air in the 4th portion of the duodenum. As duodenal perforation was suspected, emergency surgery was performed. Laparoscopic surgery was performed, and a quarter-circumferential perforation was found in the 4th portion of the duodenum. The perforation was closed with barbed sutures. The patient began oral intake of fluids on POD 7. The abdominal aortic dissection improved with conservative treatment, and the patient was discharged on POD 60 without any postoperative complications. We report a case of duodenal injury and abdominal aortic dissection caused by a seat belt during a collision. The reason may be that the seat belt moved toward the upper abdomen during the collision, causing compression of the abdominal organs between the seat belt and the spine. Considering the possibility of delayed duodenal perforation, it is important to perform a CT scan again and select an appropriate treatment according to the situation."

    "abstract": "Introduction Urolithiasis is a frequent cause of emergency department (ED) visits, with computed tomography (CT) being the gold standard for diagnosis. Excessive imaging increases radiation exposure and healthcare costs. The STONE score is a validated clinical prediction tool, designed to estimate the probability of ureteric stones and reduce unnecessary imaging. Objective The main objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the STONE score in patients presenting with flank pain. Methodology This is a cross-sectional retrospective review conducted at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust (SATH), Shrewsbury, England, over a four-month period from April 1, 2023, to July 31, 2023. This quality improvement initiative reviewed 81 eligible ED patients who underwent computed tomography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (CT-KUB) for suspected ureteric stones. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging data were collected. STONE scores were calculated for all patients. Diagnostic performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results The mean age was 38.5 ± 16.1 years; 35 (43.2%) were male. Ureteric stones were confirmed in 15/19 (78.9%) high-risk, 9/45 (20%) moderate-risk, and 0/17 (0%) low-risk patients. The STONE score yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.879, with a sensitivity of 91.7% and a specificity of 66.7%. Alternative diagnoses included gallbladder stones, appendicitis, cystitis, diverticulitis, hydronephrosis, renal angiomyolipoma, polycystic kidney disease (PCKD), pyelonephritis, and small bowel obstruction (SBO). Conclusion The STONE score demonstrates good diagnostic accuracy, particularly in high-risk patients, and may help reduce unnecessary CT imaging and radiation exposure in the ED."

    "abstract": "This report describes a rare case of small bowel perforation associated with iatrogenic uterine perforation during endometrial curettage, which was successfully treated despite delayed diagnosis. A 62-year-old patient, in septic condition and exhibiting symptoms of acute abdomen, was admitted to our hospital five days after undergoing diagnostic endometrial curettage due to postmenopausal metrorrhagia. Inflammatory markers were elevated. An emergency computed tomography (CT) scan revealed the presence of pneumoperitoneum and multiple fluid collections with air-fluid levels throughout the peritoneal cavity. Emergency laparotomy was performed, with severe fecal peritonitis secondary to small bowel perforation being observed. No primary uterine perforation site was confirmed intra-operatively, although histological examination of the endometrial curettage material confirmed the presence of smooth muscle tissue and debris of intestinal epithelium. Salvage surgery for neglected peritonitis was carried out, including enterectomy that involved the perforation site and creation of two ileostomies (end ileostomy and mucus fistula). The patient's worsening condition prompted admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), where she remained for 22 days and was subsequently transferred to the surgical ward, where she remained for another 15 days. She was discharged from the ward in good condition with instructions for follow-up assessment and scheduling of bowel restoration surgery. Based on the description of this rare case, the diagnostic approach and therapeutic options for this rare complication are discussed. Special emphasis is placed on the benefits of early diagnosis, which significantly contributes to ensuring the best prognostic outcome."

    "abstract": "Chyme recycling (CR) is an effective therapeutic approach that involves reintroducing bowel contents from the proximal to the distal enterostomy limb and is recognized for its ability to reduce or prevent enterostomy-related complications. Although the benefits of CR are well documented, reports on its potential adverse events remain limited. We report the case of an extremely low-birth-weight infant (ELBWI) who developed septic shock caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae immediately after the first CR. The male infant, born at 22 weeks' gestation via emergency cesarean section, had a birth weight of 496 g. On day 7, he developed focal intestinal perforation and underwent an emergency double-barrel ostomy. CR into the distal bowel was initiated on day 27, after which he developed septic shock. The patient was promptly treated with antibiotic therapy and intensive circulatory support. Blood cultures subsequently confirmed K. pneumoniae infection. After a 14-day course of antibiotics, repeat blood cultures were negative. Probiotic infusion into the distal bowel resumed on day 30, and CR was reintroduced on day 70. CR was then continued until ostomy closure on day 123 without further complications. Overall, sepsis may be associated with CR in ELBWIs, necessitating close monitoring after its initiation. Additionally, because of the risk of bacterial proliferation in chyme within the stoma, it is advisable to use freshly collected chyme in the neonatal intensive care unit setting."

However, sometimes it may have an unusual presentation, posing intraoperative challenges. Here we report an unusual presentation of this rare disease. A 32-year-old male presented to the emergency department following an abandoned irreducible right inguinal hernia repair at a peripheral hospital. The patient had a transected segment of small bowel extruding from the incision site, sutured to the skin margin. On assessment, a 6x2 cm mass was discovered arising from the transected segment of the extruding bowel. After a formal exploratory laparotomy, a segment of small bowel, including the mass and transected bowel, was resected and brought out as a double-barrel ileostomy in the right iliac fossa. The right inguinal hernia was repaired with Bassini's herniorrhaphy. Histopathological examination confirmed the mass lesion as an AML. This case underlines the necessity of a comprehensive preoperative assessment and knowledge of uncommon intra-abdominal pathology. Proper diagnosis and surgical planning are required to prevent intraoperative complications and enable total excision, thereby minimizing the chance of recurrence."

    "abstract": "Abdominal pain is a frequent cause of pediatric emergency admissions. While appendicitis is the most common surgical cause, many non-surgical conditions also exist. Delays in diagnosis increase the risk of perforation. Biomarkers like the Systemic Immune Index (SII) and HALP Score have recently been used to predict prognosis in various conditions, especially cancer. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of SII and HALP scores in pediatric appendicitis, comparing them with each other and with other commonly used or proposed biomarkers. Patients under the age of 18 who were hospitalized in the Pediatric Surgery Clinic of Süleyman Demirel University Faculty of Medicine Hospital with suspicion of appendicitis between 2011 and 2023 were included in this study. Demographic data, lab values, surgical notes and pathology results were reviewed. Patients were grouped as nonspecific abdominal pain (NAP), acute appendicitis (AA) and complicated appendicitis (CA). Among 719 patients, 212 had NAP, 403 had AA and 104 had CA. SII was significantly higher in AA compared to NAP and rose with disease severity (p<0.001). HALP scores differed significantly among all groups (p<0.001). SII better distinguished AA from NAP, while HALP was more effective in identifying CA from AA. Increased SII and decreased HALP were linked to higher risk of AA and CA. No single marker reliably differentiates NAP, AA and CA. This study suggests that SII is useful in identifying AA, while HALP better detects CA, indicating both markers may aid in the diagnostic process of pediatric abdominal pain."

Fluoroscopy-guided air enema reduction (FGAR) is the standard non-surgical treatment for uncomplicated cases. To identify factors associated with FGAR outcomes in paediatric intussusception. A retrospective analytical study was conducted at Universitas Academic Hospital, Bloemfontein, South Africa, including 110 patients with radiologically confirmed intussusception from November 2016 to December 2022. Data encompassed demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory results, and imaging findings. Among 110 cases (median age 7 months, symptom duration 2 days), 37 were primarily surgically managed, while 73 underwent FGAR attempts (31 successful, 42 unsuccessful, requiring surgery). Of the 79 surgical cases, 24 had manual reduction without resection. Unsuccessful FGAR was significantly associated with younger age (p = 0.0249), dehydration (p = 0.0299), ascites (p = 0.0172), and increased outer wall intussusception diameter on ultrasound (p = 0.0026). In this South African cohort, unsuccessful FGAR was linked to younger age, dehydration, ascites, and larger intussusception size on ultrasound. Early recognition and routine ultrasound use are critical in resource-limited settings to enhance non-surgical outcomes and reduce surgical burden. This study identifies predictors of FGAR failure in a low-resource context, informing clinical decision-making and addressing a gap in the literature on intussusception management in low- and middle-income countries."

    "abstract": "Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a life-threatening skin and soft tissue infection with a significant mortality rate that is rapidly progressive, causing sepsis, systemic toxicity, and multi-organ failure. A female patient known to have high-grade serous ovarian cancer stage 3 C, for which she received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery and then completed her adjuvant therapy in September 2018. She had a history of incisional hernia and underwent open repair of an incisional hernia in 2021. She had a recurrence and underwent laparoscopic incisional hernia repair with mesh in 2022. Two years later, she presented to the Emergency Department with features of adhesive small bowel obstruction and recurrence of incisional hernia, which was soft and reducible, managed conservatively, and planned for elective repair on the same admission. The patient showed a picture of septic shock and developed a skin manifestation of NF; she was taken emergently for extensive debridement. Unfortunately, she deteriorated the next day, developed multi-organ failure, became severely septic, and death was declared. Aeromonas are gram-negative bacteria widely present in aqueous environments; Aeromonas vironii is a very rare organism and has been identified as a rare causative agent for cellulitis and soft tissue infections. Most of the reported cases have been associated with risk factors such as liver cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, immunocompromised, and hematological malignancies. Necrotizing fasciitis has an unexpected presentation and outcome. Early detection, administration of appropriate antibiotics, and extensive surgical debridement are crucial in any suspected skin and soft tissue infection."

    "abstract": "Trochanteric fractures in elderly patients are frequently treated with gamma intramedullary nails. Although commonly performed, this procedure can result in rare but severe complications such as visceral perforation. The case involves an elderly woman who suffered iatrogenic perforation of both the urinary bladder and small intestine during gamma nail insertion. The complication was not immediately recognized, and the patient presented several weeks later with severe sepsis and pelvic peritonitis. Imaging and cystoscopy confirmed the diagnosis. Emergency surgery allowed for small bowel resection and bladder repair, with the nail left in place. The postoperative course was complicated by a vesicocutaneous fistula requiring urinary diversion. This case exemplifies the consequences of insufficient intraoperative imaging during gamma nail fixation in elderly patients. Prompt recognition and multidisciplinary management are essential to reduce morbidity and improve outcomes in such rare but life-threatening scenarios."

    "title": "Rare Presentation of Spontaneous Transomental Hernia in an Elderly Oncology Patient: Diagnostic Vigilance and Surgical Management.",
    "abstract": "Transomental hernia (TOH) is a rare internal hernia, representing approximately 1-4% of all internal hernia cases. The spontaneous form, occurring in patients without a history of abdominal surgery or trauma, is exceptionally uncommon and presents a significant diagnostic challenge due to its nonspecific clinical features. TOH typically involves herniation of small bowel loops through a defect in the greater omentum. We report a case of spontaneous TOH in a 76-year-old male undergoing chemotherapy for synchronous primary malignancies - left lung adenocarcinoma and right renal cell carcinoma - who presented with features of intestinal obstruction. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography suggested internal herniation with ischemia. Intraoperative findings confirmed approximately 100 cm of small bowel incarcerated through a 3-cm defect in the right side of the greater omentum. Age-related omental atrophy, along with chemotherapy-induced mesenteric fibrosis, microvascular injury, and impaired regenerative capacity, likely contributed to the defect formation. An emergency midline laparotomy was performed, involving resection of the gangrenous bowel and the creation of a double-barrel enterostomy. Postoperatively, distal enteral refeeding was critical in electrolyte correction, nutritional support, and early recovery. TOH carries a high risk of strangulation and should be considered in elderly patients with bowel obstruction, even with no history of prior abdominal surgery, especially those receiving platinum-based chemotherapy. Although rare, TOH should be included in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen in elderly oncology patients, even without previous abdominal surgery. Timely surgical intervention is vital to reduce morbidity and optimize outcomes."

    "abstract": "We present a case of small intestinal perforation within an inguinal hernia following low-energy indirect trauma. A 55-year-old man with a known right inguinal hernia which had no prior indication for surgery developed acute right groin pain after sudden braking caused his scooter handlebar to strike his right thigh. Physical examination and computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed multiple pockets of extraluminal air within the hernia sac, as well as gas bubbles in the surrounding intestinal contents. Based on these findings, we made a diagnosis of small intestinal perforation within the inguinal hernia. Small intestinal perforation within an inguinal hernia is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening complication requiring emergent surgical intervention. Delays in diagnosis and management can lead to peritonitis, abscess formation, sepsis, and prolonged hospitalization. Therefore, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for intestinal perforation in patients with inguinal hernias, even in the absence of direct trauma or subsequent low-energy injuries."

    "abstract": "Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a medical emergency that may represent the first manifestation of diabetes mellitus. Management typically centers on fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy, and treatment of precipitating factors, but clinicians must remain alert to rare and life-threatening complications. We report a 28-year-old male with no prior history of diabetes who presented with influenza-associated DKA. Despite standard therapy, he developed worsening shock and persistent abdominal tenderness. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed portal venous gas and pneumatosis intestinalis, prompting emergent laparotomy. Intraoperative findings confirmed extensive ischemic necrosis of the terminal ileum, right colon, and appendix, requiring resection with temporary abdominal closure. A second-look procedure 48 hours later demonstrated viable remaining bowel, and an ileo-transverse anastomosis with definitive closure was performed. The patient improved steadily, was extubated, and discharged home in stable condition. This case highlights the need for vigilance when abdominal pain or hemodynamic instability persists in DKA patients despite appropriate management. Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI), although rare and more often described in older individuals with vascular risk factors, can occur in young adults in the setting of profound hypovolemia and shock. Early recognition, aggressive fluid resuscitation, careful titration of vasopressors, and timely surgical intervention are critical to improving outcomes and preventing mortality in these patients."

    "abstract": "BackgroundPeritoneal dialysis (PD)-associated peritonitis is a major complication in PD and may require abdominal imaging to identify the intra-abdominal pathology, though its clinical utility remains unclear.MethodsThis retrospective, single-center study included all episodes of PD-associated peritonitis that occurred between January 2013 and July 2024. The primary objective was to identify factors predicting the use of abdominal imaging during peritonitis episodes.ResultsA total of 691 episodes of peritonitis occurred in 376 PD patients during the study period. Of these, 354 episodes (51%) were subjected to abdominal imaging, which revealed 102 episodes (29%) suggestive of enteric or other secondary peritonitis. The most common abnormal imaging findings were colitis or enteritis, followed by ileus or intestinal obstruction. Imaging findings indicating the need for urgent medical or surgical attention were observed in 27 episodes of peritonitis (7.6%). Imaging was more frequently performed in peritonitis episodes caused by polymicrobial enteric bacteria (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 4.49; 95% CI [2.13-9.48]), single enteric bacteria (AOR: 2.02; 95% CI [1.31-3.13]), and fungi (AOR: 7.77; 95% CI [2.48-24.29]), compared to nonenteric bacteria. Hypotension (AOR: 6.19; 95% CI [2.81-13.66]), cloudy effluent (AOR: 1.91; 95% CI [1.30-2.80]), and higher PD effluent cell counts at presentation (AOR: 1.03; 95% CI [1.01-1.05]) were all significantly associated with imaging. Only polymicrobial infection involving enteric bacteria (AOR: 2.65; 95% CI [1.28-5.50]) was significantly associated with abnormal imaging findings suggestive of secondary or enteric peritonitis. Furthermore, polymicrobial infections with enteric bacteria (AOR: 9.17; 95% CI [3.29-25.50]), fungal infections (AOR: 5.25; 95% CI [1.26-21.96]), and hypotension (AOR: 2.77; 95% CI [1.08-7.07]; p = .03) were significantly associated with critical imaging findings.ConclusionImaging in PD peritonitis was primarily performed based on causative organisms or clinical features. Only polymicrobial enteric peritonitis, fungal infections, and hypotension were significantly associated with critical imaging findings. Future prospective studies are required to improve diagnostic accuracy and guide imaging decisions in PD-related peritonitis."

Diagnosis of obturator hernia is challenging because of vague atypical presentations. This case report describes a woman in her late 80s who presented with colicky right lower abdominal pain, abdominal distension, and obstipation, diagnosed with a right obturator hernia, computed tomography (CT) scan. An elderly female presented with chief complaints of right lower abdominal pain and abdominal distension. On examination, the abdomen was distended with generalized tenderness and rebound tenderness. CECT abdomen and pelvis showed dilated small bowel loops with a transition point caused by herniation through the right obturator foramen. Emergency laparotomy revealed a right strangulated obturator hernia. Resection of the gangrenous ileal segment with ileo-ileal anastomosis and primary closure of the defect was done. Obturator hernia occurs through the obturator canal, which is mostly seen in elderly females. Obturator hernia usually presents as partial bowel obstruction because of a high frequency (41%-100%) of Richter's herniation of the small bowel into the obturator canal. Diagnosis can be delayed because of its nonspecific clinical presentation. CT scan is the most accurate and sensitive way to diagnose the obturator hernia. Obturator defects can be repaired by various methods including simple suture closure, closure of the obturator with adjacent tissue, and mesh placement during laparotomy. Obturator hernia is a rare abdominal hernia with delayed diagnosis because of vague atypical clinical presentation. Early diagnosis and prompt surgical treatment are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "Right ventricular perforation by pacemaker leads is often reported. However, reports of delayed lead perforation, defined as the perforation that occurs >1 month after implantation, are rare. Despite the fact that delayed pacemaker lead perforation can be an emergency, no clear treatment strategy has been defined. Herein, we report our experience with a case of delayed lead-associated perforation causing cardiac tamponade. A 60-year-old man presented to the emergency room with chest and back pain and dyspnea. He had undergone pacemaker implantation for advanced atrioventricular block eight years ago. He was found to have cardiac tamponade due to right ventricular lead-associated perforation. Emergency surgery was performed to drain the fluid and control the bleeding via a median sternotomy. The lead screw had perforated a vein on the cardiac surface. The perforating lead was retained because the threshold and impedance of the lead were unchanged. Only the perforation was repaired. After seven days, the ventricular lead threshold increased. This was managed by adjusting the pacemaker settings. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged home. The treatment of right ventricular lead-associated perforation generally entails removal and reinsertion of the lead. However, in our patient, a definitive diagnosis could not be made before the operation because the right ventricle was not completely perforated by the lead tip. Furthermore, the patient had concomitant cardiac tamponade with signs of shock. Therefore, open surgery was performed. After the perforation site is repaired, the area around the myocardium may deteriorate for several reasons (e.g., edema, fibrosis, and partial myocardial tissue necrosis). Therefore, if the pacemaker lead cannot be removed (or reinserted), as in our patient, measures such as insertion or implantation of a temporary pacemaker lead need to be taken in anticipation of deterioration of the myocardium around the retained lead."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a frequent surgical emergency in the US, responsible for 12-16% of hospital admissions for abdominal pain. While treatable with nasogastric tubes, delayed surgery for SBO with ischemia drastically increases mortality (up to 25%). This study aim to investigate the diagnostic utility of computed tomography (CT) for small bowel obstruction (SBO). A comprehensive search for relevant articles was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, encompassing studies published until February 2024. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened to identify eligible studies. We then assessed the quality of the included articles, extracted relevant data, and performed a rigorous analysis. A total of 40 observational studies comprising 4,502 patients were eligible for the analysis. CT demonstrated high performance in both ruling in and ruling out SBO. The pooled sensitivity was 77.55% (95% CI: 71.41-83.69%) and specificity was 86.43% (95% CI: 82.75-90.12%), supporting its continued use for diagnosing SBO in patients with acute abdominal pain. Our findings indicate that CT offers a reliable tool for diagnosing SBO in patients with abdominal pain. CT effectively identifies key signs of SBO, facilitating informed clinical decision-making. However, observed variations in sensitivity and specificity across studies highlight the importance of using CT alongside other diagnostic modalities for a comprehensive evaluation. Additionally, the high heterogeneity among studies highlights the need for further large-scale investigations."

    "abstract": "Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a vascular emergency where delays in diagnosis or treatment can lead to irreversible bowel injury and death. Many patients initially present to hospitals without surgical or vascular capabilities and require interhospital transfer. The clinical impact of such transfers on treatment and outcomes in AMI remains poorly defined. We performed a retrospective cohort study using the National Inpatient Sample (2019 to 2021) to evaluate the association between interhospital transfer and outcomes in patients with AMI. Adult patients with a primary diagnosis of AMI were identified using ICD-10 codes. Patients were categorized by transfer status. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate associations with in-hospital mortality and procedural interventions, adjusting for age and comorbidity burden. Of 39,690 hospitalizations for AMI, 14.6% involved interhospital transfer. Transferred patients had a higher comorbidity burden and were more often treated at rural or micropolitan hospitals. They were significantly more likely to undergo major surgical and vascular procedures, including bowel resection (odds ratio [OR] 3.48), mesenteric bypass (OR 3.32), and angioplasty (OR 2.66; all p < 0.0001). Markers of critical illness, such as intubation (OR 2.15) and dialysis (OR 1.30), were also more frequent in this group. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher among transferred patients (OR 2.05), and transfer remained independently associated with increased mortality after adjusting for age and comorbidity burden (adjusted OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.10). Interhospital transfer in AMI is strongly associated with increased clinical severity and in-hospital mortality. These findings emphasize the urgency of early diagnosis, rapid triage, and timely access to definitive care, supporting the need for structured regional systems and transfer protocols for AMI."

Early detection and appropriate timing of surgical intervention are crucial to prevent life-threatening consequences. We present the case of a 74-year-old man with a recent history of dual-chamber pacemaker implantation who presented with atypical chest pain and low-grade fever. Initial transthoracic echocardiography raised suspicion of mitral valve pathology, but transoesophageal and 3D echocardiography revealed a pseudoaneurysm of the MAIVF and a flail posterior mitral leaflet due to leaflet perforation. Blood cultures confirmed Staphylococcus epidermidis infective endocarditis. The patient underwent urgent valve replacement surgery but unfortunately developed severe biventricular dysfunction and died despite maximal supportive care. This case illustrates the critical role of multimodality imaging, especially 3D echocardiography, in diagnosing MAIVF pseudoaneurysm and assessing surgical indications in the context of infective endocarditis. Surgical timing and haemodynamic stability are essential in optimizing outcomes."

A 53-year-old patient presented to the emergency department with right lower quadrant abdominal pain evolving over the past 24 hours. On admission, the patient was afebrile. Laboratory findings showed no evidence of neutropenia. Abdominal imaging led to the diagnosis of typhlitis, despite the absence of typical predisposing factors. This case highlights that typhlitis can occur outside the classical context of neutropenia. Early recognition of this condition, even in immunocompetent patients, is essential to initiate appropriate management and prevent complications such as intestinal perforation, which remains the primary prognostic factor."

It occurs secondary to the Macklin phenomenon, which is alveolar rupture due to hyperdistension. Although it has a benign nature, most patients get admitted to the hospital and undergo unnecessary investigations. A 20-year-old female presented to the emergency department with retrosternal chest pain. She had no preceding history of vomiting or alcohol intake. She was diagnosed with celiac disease by endoscopic biopsy eight months ago. The patient was vitally stable. Chest examination was unremarkable. Basic labs revealed no elevation in inflammatory markers. Chest X-ray revealed pneumomediastinum. A pulmonologist was consulted and advised for computed tomography (CT) thorax with contrast, which confirmed the presence of pneumomediastinum with no associated subcutaneous emphysema or pleural effusion. The patient was discharged home with close follow-up in the pulmonology clinic. No antibiotics or further esophageal evaluation were performed. Her final diagnosis was SPM, and she continued to do well on further visits. Although endoscopy is a well-known cause of both SPM due to simple reflexes to scope manoeuvres like cough reflex, and secondary complex pneumomediastinum due to esophageal perforation, the patient's benign course is more in favour of SPM. An early pulmonology consultation resulted in the safe discharge of the patient, preventing unnecessary admission and investigations. This highlights the benign nature of the condition and the potential cost savings associated with prompt diagnosis and treatment."

We report the case of a 25-year-old multiparous woman with complicated appendicitis masquerading as septic abortion in the first trimester. She was referred to us on the second post-abortal day with persistent abdominal pain. Two days earlier, at 12 weeks of gestation, she had presented to her local hospital with lower abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. She was diagnosed with inevitable abortion, and a suction and evacuation procedure was performed. On presentation to our center, she was septicemic with features of systemic inflammatory response syndrome. She was febrile, with a blood pressure of 100/70 mm Hg, a total leukocyte count of 14,210/cumm, and 79.1% neutrophils. Ultrasound revealed a bulky uterus with an intact contour and a septated pelvic collection. A provisional diagnosis of septic abortion was made, and she was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. After 24 hours, her condition showed no improvement. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed multiple fluid collections. An emergency laparotomy, following a failed laparoscopic attempt, demonstrated a perforation at the base of the appendix along with a fecalith in the peritoneal cavity. She was discharged on postoperative day 7 and was doing well at follow-up. Histopathology confirmed appendicular perforation, which probably caused the first-trimester abortion. A high index of suspicion, combined with imaging modalities such as ultrasonography and/or MRI/CT, is essential for the early diagnosis of complicated appendicitis in pregnancy. Early surgical intervention in cases of appendicular perforation complicating pregnancy is crucial to achieve optimal outcomes."

    "abstract": "Typhoid intestinal perforation (TIP) is a life-threatening, late complication of typhoid fever that disproportionately impacts children in low resource settings and continues to have devastating consequences worldwide. Despite elimination of typhoid fever in most high income countries, typhoid fever and TIP remain endemic in many countries around the world as a result of inadequate investments in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and lack of access to vaccines. A first National Typhoid Conference was held in Niamey, Niger on July 22, 2023, where surgeons and other medical and health professionals from Niger convened with local and international health professionals to discuss their experiences with TIP and advocate for better prevention and treatment of the disease. The high number of intestinal perforations diagnosed during surgery, and the lack of capacity for performing blood cultures motivated surgeons in Niger to convene and share data on complications of typhoid, epidemiology, and diagnosis. TIP, a leading cause of peritonitis in Africa, often results in emergency surgery and has reported mortality rates up to 30% in pediatric patients. The availability of four safe and effective typhoid conjugate vaccines, two with committed financial support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, makes prevention through vaccination a realistic near-option for typhoid fever to complement improvements in WASH."

A solitary lung metastasis emerged afterwards, and was surgically removed. However, the patient developed LRRC in front of the sacrum. As surgical resection for the local recurrence was considered too invasive, carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) was performed as radical local therapy. Because the surrounding intestine was highly adherent to the tumor and there was a high risk of developing an ulcer, the intestine was prophylactically resected. The patient has remained relapse-free for 2 years and 6 months since the most recent surgery. CIRT for LRRC appears to represent a useful therapeutic option in combination with prophylactic intestinal resection."

Cenegermin is a recombinant human nerve growth factor approved for stage 2/3 NK, though data on its efficacy outside of United States/European populations are limited. This prospective, phase IV, open-label, multicenter study investigated the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of cenegermin eye drops in Chinese patients with stage 2/3 NK in a routine clinical setting (CTR20220066). Patients received cenegermin eye drops (20 mcg/mL; 6 times/day at 2-hour intervals) for 8 weeks with follow-up to week 56. The primary endpoint was corneal healing at week 8 per investigator assessment. Additional endpoints included lesion worsening, corneal healing through week 56, safety, and PK. Of the 28 patients receiving cenegermin, 22/26 (84.6%, 95% confidence interval 65.1-95.6%; 2 missing) achieved corneal healing at week 8; 3/22 (13.6%) reported recurrence during 48-week follow-up but 20/22 (90.9%) were healed at week 56; and 2/28 (7.1%) experienced lesion worsening during 8-week treatment. In addition, 25/28 (89.3%) experienced ≥ 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE); for the majority (23/28, 82.2%) of these patients, TEAEs were mild/moderate. None of the serious TEAEs reported by 10 (35.7%) patients were assessed as related to cenegermin or led to treatment discontinuation. Eye pain was the most common cenegermin-related TEAE (5/28, 17.9%), primarily limited to the treatment period. These findings demonstrate that cenegermin eye drops are an effective, generally well-tolerated treatment in Chinese patients with stage 2/3 NK, supporting their use in this patient population.

NSQIP-P reports are calculated from case reviews with a 30-day post-operative follow-up. From 2020 to 2022, the post-operative LOS for uncomplicated appendicectomy at SCHN was a median of 24 h (n = 714). A quality improvement project was initiated using Clinical Redesign Methodology. The project team developed an Uncomplicated Appendicectomy Guideline to standardize care. The Guideline also included a criteria-led discharge that could be applied after 6 h of post-operative recovery. Comprehensive information was provided for parents/carers on discharge. In 2024, the median postoperative LOS was reduced from 24 to 16 h (n = 185). This represents a statistically significant reduction in post-operative length of stay of 33% (p < 0.001). There were no statistically significant increase in post-operative readmissions (p = 0.95) or in NSQIP-P morbidity rates, although there was an increase in post-operative Emergency Department presentations noted, from a median of 7-10 annual presentations (p < 0.05, n = 444). There was positive feedback from parents/carers with the earlier discharge (n = 16). Parents/carers who received the discharge information sheet reported that they were better informed about their child's care. Staff in focus groups highlighted a greater autonomy in post-operative care (n = 24).

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic strained health systems worldwide, diverting resources and disrupting routine healthcare services. These disruptions may lead to health risks from delayed or reduced care. Health system resilience (HSR) – a critical factor in maintaining health services during crises – refers to a system’s ability to anticipate, prepare for, absorb, respond to, recover from, and adapt to disruptions. To be effective, HSR must also be equitable, ensuring that all socioeconomic groups have access to healthcare services during crises. Sweden’s approach, which relied on public adherence to government recommendations rather than enforcing restrictions, presents a unique case for studying HSR. This study aims to evaluate aspects of HSR in Sweden during the COVID-19 pandemic by analysing changes in essential health service utilisation across different phases of the pandemic, and by examining sociodemographic differences in utilisation by education and sex. This study utilises interrupted time series analysis to evaluate changes in healthcare service utilisation across various levels of the Swedish health system with stratification by education and sex. Primary care was measured through diabetes diagnoses, emergency care through appendicitis cases, inpatient care through hospital admission for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and cancer diagnostics through diagnosis rates. Data were obtained from various population based Swedish health registries through the SWECOV project. The findings highlight varying degrees of disruptions and resilience across different sectors. Emergency care, primary care, and symptom-based cancer diagnosis showed signs of recovery after an initial drop, whereas cancer screening, was more affected. In the case of inpatient care for IBD, the number of admissions declined, though the length of hospital stays remained unchanged. Education level did not impact healthcare utilisation for most indicators, and differences between men and women were generally small. The Swedish HSR during the COVID-19 pandemic was challenged but remained intact in most healthcare sectors. The health system on different levels also managed to a large degree cater for the diagnoses covered in this study, largely independent of educational level and sex. As data availability increases with time further research will help gain a deeper understanding of the outcomes of the pandemic on health services unrelated to COVID-19, including the role of education in influencing healthcare utilisation."

After obtaining the ethical approval from the university, the researcher visited the hospital and extracted the required data from the patient's clinical file (in accordance with the research checklist). Then, the collected data were entered into SPSS software (version 21) for data analysis. Of the 180 patient records included in the study, 28 (15.6%) developed SSI. The descriptive analysis revealed that among the patients with SSI, 19 patients were men (67.9%), 18 (64.3%) had a low BMI, 8 (28.6%) had blood type A-, and 19 (67.9%) patients had a fever below 38 °C. Regarding clinical symptoms, 1 (3.6%) patient had gangrenous appendicitis, and 22 (78.6%) required urgent surgery. Notably, no significant risk factors for SSI were identified. There was no association between SSI status and demographic variables, clinical symptoms, or underlying conditions (p>0.05). The incidence of SSI following appendectomy was relatively higher than in previous studies, though no significant risk factors were identified. Given this, standardization and adherence to evidence-based infection control practices, such as an appropriate preoperative antiseptic preparation, timely administration of prophylactic antibiotics, and the use of laparoscopic techniques when feasible, might help reduce SSI risk."

    "title": "Delayed Diagnosis of Hirschsprung Disease in an 18-Year-Old Male Patient With Fecaloma and Colonic Perforation: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Hirschsprung disease is a congenital disorder most commonly diagnosed in the neonatal period or early childhood, typically due to failure to pass meconium within the first 24 hours of life. However, diagnosis may also occur later in adolescence or adulthood in patients with longstanding significant constipation, often leading to delayed recognition and the development of serious complications. We report the case of an 18-year-old male patient with a longstanding history of chronic constipation since infancy, who presented to the emergency department with progressive abdominal distension, abdominal pain, and failure to pass stools. Physical examination revealed severe fecal impaction, and imaging studies demonstrated generalized colonic dilation without evidence of free air. Laboratory findings included hyponatremia, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, and evidence of acute decompensation with tissue hypoperfusion. Initial conservative management with intravenous fluids, electrolyte replacement, and enemas provided only partial improvement, and due to progressive deterioration, an urgent exploratory laparotomy was performed. Intraoperative findings revealed megacolon with spontaneous perforation of the descending colon and a large fecaloma. A subtotal colectomy with colostomy was carried out. The diagnosis of short-segment Hirschsprung disease was confirmed histopathologically by the absence of ganglion cells in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses. The postoperative course was favorable, and intestinal transit was later restored in a staged surgical approach. This case highlights the importance of considering organic causes in adolescents with chronic constipation, particularly in the presence of metabolic compromise or acute abdominal complications, as timely surgical intervention can be lifesaving in the context of perforation."

    "abstract": "Richter's femoral hernia is a rare form of abdominal wall hernia at the femoral canal. The development of an enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) in this setting is extremely rare and highlights a rare but serious complication resulting from delayed presentation. It underscores the importance of early recognition and timely surgical intervention in resource-limited countries to prevent morbidity and mortality. A 90-year-old woman from a remote village presented with lower abdominal pain, bilious vomiting, and a right groin wound. Examination revealed bilious discharge from the wound. Imaging showed an incarcerated right Richter's femoral hernia. After stabilization, she underwent emergency laparotomy with resection and anastomosis of the perforated ileal segment, followed by primary repair of the femoral defect. The patient recovered well and showed no recurrence at the 3-month follow-up. The development of a groin wound with an ECF in this context of Richter's femoral hernia is extremely rare. Differentiating this condition from similar presentations such as ruptured inguinal abscess, suppurative inguinal lymphadenopathy, or inguinal necrotizing fasciitis is crucial for timely intervention. A high index of suspicion and the use of advanced imaging modalities are necessary to delineate the pathology. Structured multidisciplinary care and a tailored surgical approach can lead to successful outcomes. Spontaneous perforation of a Richter's femoral hernia resulting in an enterocutaneous fistula is an extremely rare and serious complication in the elderly with delayed presentation. High clinical suspicion, early recognition, and prompt surgical intervention are crucial for improving outcomes."

    "abstract": "Jejunal diverticulosis is a rare condition, often asymptomatic, but it can lead to serious complications such as diverticulitis or perforation. Management of perforated jejunal diverticula is challenging, particularly in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) who have undergone kidney transplantation and are receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Early diagnosis is often difficult due to nonspecific symptoms and the frequent presence of multiple diverticula, which increases the risk of postoperative complications. We present the case of a 61-year-old woman with ADPKD, who developed jejunal diverticular perforation 3 years after undergoing ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation. She initially presented with mild abdominal pain and was managed conservatively, but her condition worsened 1 month later with evidence of free air on CT. Emergency surgery revealed multiple jejunal diverticula with a perforation on the mesenteric side, and a double-barrel stoma was created to avoid anastomotic leakage. Four months postoperatively, endoscopic and fluoroscopic evaluation from both the oral and stoma sides enabled accurate identification and marking of the diseased segment. A second-stage surgery was successfully performed with segmental jejunal resection and stoma closure. Histopathology confirmed multiple true diverticula, including at the perforation site. The patient recovered well and was discharged approximately 1.5 months later. This rare case of perforated multiple jejunal diverticula in a patient with ADPKD highlights the value of a two-stage surgical approach with preoperative endoscopic evaluation to enable safe and targeted resection in complex settings."

This case report describes the successful resuscitation and management of a neonate who experienced 15 min of severe asphyxia. The male infant, born at 36 weeks' gestation via emergency cesarean section, had extremely low Apgar scores (1 at 1, 5, and 10 min). He underwent 15 min of resuscitation, including airway clearance, endotracheal intubation, positive pressure ventilation, chest compressions, and multiple administrations of epinephrine. Post-resuscitation, he exhibited severe dysfunction in multiple organ systems. The infant received comprehensive treatment, including invasive mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for acute kidney injury, therapeutic hypothermia for neuroprotection, surgical treatment for necrotizing enterocolitis with perforation, and specialized nutritional support. His condition significantly improved, with resolution of MODS, and he was discharged with weight gain and good feeding tolerance. Neurological assessments at discharge showed no significant abnormalities; however, long-term follow-up is ongoing to monitor for potential neurodevelopmental outcomes. This case highlights the importance of timely resuscitation and meticulous systemic management in achieving a favorable prognosis for neonates with severe asphyxia and MODS. The successful collaboration of a multidisciplinary team played a key role in the neonate's recovery."

    "abstract": "Acute gastric dilatation (AGD) is a life-threatening condition that could progress to necrosis and perforation. Most cases are associated with mechanical obstruction or eating disorders; however, spontaneous perforation after a single large meal in patients without prior risk factors is exceptionally rare. A 64-year-old woman with no history of eating disorders was admitted with peritonitis and septic shock, 24 hours after consuming a large meal. Computed tomography showed pneumoperitoneum, free intra-abdominal fluid and a gastric perforation. Emergent laparotomy revealed necrosis and a 6 cm perforation in the anterior gastric wall, requiring partial gastrectomy and feeding jejunostomy. Despite severe initial acidosis and acute kidney injury, the patient recovered fully after 10 days of intensive care. Histopathology confirmed ischemic necrosis without evidence of microorganisms or malignancy. This case highlights that a gastric necrosis caused by AGD can occur even in the absence of classic risk factors. Venous ischemia from intraluminal pressure elevation - rather than arterial insufficiency - was the likely mechanism. Early recognition and surgical intervention are critical to survival."

    "abstract": "Diverticular disease (DD) represents a prevalent clinical challenge, especially in the aging population. The sigmoid colon is the most frequently affected area. However, the presence of DD in the upper gastrointestinal tract, including the duodenum and jejunum, underscores the need for comprehensive understanding and management. In this minireview we analyzed the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of DD with a specific focus on jejunal diverticulosis. Although the incidence of gastrointestinal DD increases with age, the male and female prevalence is the same. Clinical presentation is either asymptomatic or with unclear abdominal symptoms. However, complications such as perforation and bleeding can occur in a subset of patients and demand urgent diagnosis and surgical treatment. Imaging alternatives, including CT and enteroscopy, play key roles in diagnosis. Surgical management is warranted in cases with persistent bleeding or more complicated acute abdomen. Jejunal diverticulosis (JD) is a less common condition and poses a unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Bleeding has been reported as the most important complication in JD. Therefore, early diagnosis and management are critical to improve patient outcomes and reduce morbidity and mortality. This article highlighted the importance of considering JD in the differential diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding, especially in patients with concurrent colon diverticulosis in which the bleeding source remains unidentified. Therefore, current challenges in JD are better understanding the etiopathology and optimal management strategies."

Urgent-start peritoneal dialysis (PD) has emerged as a viable alternative to hemodialysis particularly in resource-limited settings. However, concerns remain regarding catheter-related complications associated with early initiation of PD. Automated PD (APD) offers enhanced flexibility and fluid management, but evidence regarding its safety and outcomes in urgent-start scenarios with shortened break-in periods is limited. To evaluate the clinical outcomes and biochemical changes associated with urgent-start APD with a shortened break-in period. This was a single center, observational study that included 62 patients with end-stage kidney disease who required urgent-start dialysis, underwent PD catheter placement, and received APD. Patients were stratified based on catheter opening time (< 12 hours vs > 12 hours). Catheter-related complications, biochemical parameters, and dialysis efficacy were analyzed. The median catheter opening time was 11 h (interquartile range: 8-14 hours). No significant differences in catheter-related complications were observed between groups (P > 0.05). Catheter dysfunction, migration, leakage, and replacement occurred in 14.5%, 9.7%, 12.9%, and 11.3% of patients, respectively. APD led to significant reductions in serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, urea, phosphorus, and potassium (P < 0.05), alongside correction of metabolic acidosis. No cases of peritonitis or hemoperitoneum were observed. Urgent-start APD with shortened break-in appears safe with low complication rates and improved biochemical outcomes."

CASE PRESENTATION: This paper discusses the case of a 37-year-old Saudi female who was hospitalized with acute right lower quadrant pain, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The initial differential diagnosis included ovarian torsion and appendicitis. Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed a right fallopian tube twisted five times, which was later confirmed to be necrotic. Given the irreversible damage to the fallopian tube, a right salpingectomy was performed. The patient recovered well postoperatively and was discharged after 48 h without complications. This case report underscores the importance of considering isolated fallopian tube torsion in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain and highlights the need for prompt surgical intervention to prevent severe complications. The rarity of isolated tubal torsion, normal Doppler findings despite significant torsion, and the surgical management decisions impacting fertility make this case an informative addition to current literature."

    "abstract": "Acute abdominal pain is a frequent emergency department presentation requiring prompt and accurate diagnosis to guide timely management. Ultrasound imaging plays a critical role in the differential diagnosis of this symptom, offering several advantages including wide availability, cost-effectiveness, and real-time assessment without ionizing radiation. Color and spectral Doppler further enhance diagnostic accuracy by allowing the assessment of blood flow and vascular patterns, which is crucial for identifying ischemic processes. Additionally, ultrasound can help distinguish between gynecological and non-gynecological conditions, such as appendicitis, urinary tract pathologies, or gastrointestinal abnormalities, thereby guiding more targeted investigative pathways or treatment modalities. The rapid, bedside application of ultrasound is especially valuable in unstable patients, ensuring expedited triage and intervention. In certain cases, a negative or inconclusive ultrasound may necessitate further imaging with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. However, ultrasound remains the first-line modality, particularly in pregnant women, to minimize radiation exposure. By integrating ultrasound findings with clinical data and laboratory results, clinicians can establish a precise diagnosis, avoid unnecessary procedures, and initiate timely therapeutic interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes."

Following initial emergency surgery for gastric perforation, she remained dependent on a jejunostomy for over a year, developing severe malnutrition, dysphagia, and psychological decline. Definitive reconstruction was achieved with a one-stage subtotal esophagectomy and total gastrectomy. A right colon interposition graft, routed through the posterior mediastinum, was used after confirming adequate perfusion despite the absence of the right colic artery. The procedure included a cervical esophago-colonic anastomosis, Roux-en-Y colojejunal anastomosis, ileotransverse bypass, and incidental cholecystectomy and appendectomy. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, with the patient resuming soft oral intake, gaining weight, and showing marked nutritional and functional improvement. This case underscores the value of right colon interposition when the stomach is unavailable, highlighting the need for tailored conduit choice, precise vascular assessment, and multidisciplinary perioperative care in complex benign esophageal disease."

MCLs of the gastrointestinal tract can lead to bowel obstruction, and surgical intervention is warranted for those presenting in the acute setting. We report a case of a female neonate who was brought to the emergency department with a history of 24 hours of bilious emesis and abdominal distention. An abdominal X-ray was suspicious for bowel obstruction, and the patient was emergently taken to the operating room. A cystic lesion was identified in the mesentery of the jejunum, causing volvulus and bowel obstruction. The mass was resected, including the adjacent bowel. Pathology revealed a macrocystic lymphatic malformation (lymphangioma). The patient required total parenteral nutrition in the acute postoperative phase and has since weaned off successfully. The patient was ultimately discharged after an uneventful hospital course and was doing well at her 12-month follow-up. We concluded that MCLs are benign malformations that can be resected at the time of surgery. Due to the benign nature of these lesions, outcomes and prognosis are excellent."

    "abstract": "The use of sterile transducer covers for ultrasound-guided percutaneous procedures in Emergency Medicine is common. The guidance on how transducers should be disinfected post-procedure is much debated and has considerable cost and logistical implications. The perforation rate of transducer covers when used for percutaneous procedures in the Emergency Department setting has not previously been explored and could impact disinfection recommendations. This pragmatic prospective observational cohort study quantifies and compares the perforation rates of two different transducer cover types in a single Emergency Department. Details on the patient, procedure, and operator were recorded, and transducer cover perforation was retrospectively assessed by pouring a litre of water into each cover and recording details of any leakage. Polyethylene transducer covers had a post-procedure perforation rate of 15.1%, more than 6 times that of polyurethane transducer covers which had a perforation rate of 2.4%. The study also shows operators are largely unaware of this perforation. Given the post-procedure perforation rates identified, relying solely on the transducer cover as the means of infection control appears unwise, particularly as the operator is largely unaware of perforation occurring. Differences in transducer cover construction affects perforation rate. However, the chronology and aetiology of the damage are not clarified in this study, neither was resultant transducer contamination evaluated. This single centre observational study demonstrated significant variation in post-procedure perforation rates of two different transducer covers from a single manufacturer. Further research is required to determine the optimal probe cover and disinfection regime for infection control."

    "abstract": "Feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) are divided into two groups: feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). FIPV is responsible for the severe disease known as feline infectious peritonitis, while FECV typically causes mild symptoms, such as diarrhea, and often does not lead to any disease at all. Currently, it is not possible to distinguish between FIPV and FECV at the molecular level. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand the molecular features of FIPV. Here, we generated a recombinant virus by replacing the ORF1ab region and the coding sequence for the spike (S) protein of an FECV with the corresponding sequences from FIPVs. The recombinant virus (recFECV-SDF-2-1abFIPV) exhibited similar growth kinetics to its parental strain. Our analysis revealed that the replacement of the ORF1ab in the FECV caused significant alterations in protein expression within the host cells. Furthermore, the presence of the ORF1ab from the FIPV strain resulted in enhanced suppression of the innate immune response compared to the parental strain, as determined through proteomic and transcriptomic studies. Additionally, we demonstrated that the papain-like protease 2 (PL2pro) of the non-structural protein 3 (NSP3) from both FIPV and FECV functions in immune suppression, and the protease activity is required for this function."

    "abstract": "Background: Mesenteric cystic lymphatic malformations (MCLMs) are rare benign lymphatic malformations predominantly diagnosed in children. Adult cases are exceptional and typically discovered incidentally during imaging or surgery for unrelated conditions. Their intraoperative identification, particularly in emergency settings, poses diagnostic and surgical challenges due to anatomical complexity and potential vascular involvement. Methods: A literature review was performed in PubMed and Scopus to contextualize this case, focusing on intraoperative management strategies, recurrence risk, and surgical decision-making in mesenteric lymphatic malformations. Case reports, case series, and reviews in English with relevant clinical and surgical data were included, while duplicates, non-English publications, abstracts without full text, and studies lacking essential information were excluded. Case Presentation: We report a 45-year-old male who presented with acute right lower quadrant pain, clinically and radiologically consistent with acute appendicitis. Contrast-enhanced CT incidentally identified a mesenteric cystic lesion near the terminal ileum. Intraoperative findings confirmed phlegmonous appendicitis coexisting with a large MCLM, requiring segmental enterectomy and appendectomy. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of MCLMs. Conclusions: This case highlights the rare coexistence of acute appendicitis and mesenteric lymphatic malformations in an adult, illustrating the surgical challenges of unexpected lymphatic lesions in emergency settings. Emphasizing real-time intraoperative decision-making, we propose an anatomy-driven algorithm that balances complete excision with safer, conservative options based on lesion features, surgical risk, and multidisciplinary input."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Acute appendicitis (AA) is a common cause of abdominal pain that can lead to complications like perforation and intra-abdominal abscesses, increasing morbidity and mortality, often requiring emergency surgery. Nevertheless, appendectomy is performed in up to 95% of uncomplicated cases, while complications like perforation and intra-abdominal abscesses increase morbidity and mortality. The current study compares the accuracy of GPT-4.5, DeepSeek R1, and machine learning in assisting with surgical decision-making for patients presenting with lower abdominal pain at the Emergency Department. Methods: In this multicenter retrospective study, 63 histopathologically confirmed appendicitis patients and 50 control patients with right abdominal pain presenting at the Emergency Department at two German hospitals between October 2022 and October 2023 were included. Using each patient's clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings, DeepSeek (with and without Retrieval-Augmented Generation using 2020 Jerusalem guidelines) was compared in terms of accuracy with GPT-4.5 and a random forest-based machine-learning model, with a board-certified surgeon (reference standard) to determine the optimal treatment approach (laparoscopic exploration/appendectomy versus conservative antibiotic therapy). Results: Accuracy of agreement with board-certified surgeons in the decision-making of appendectomy versus conservative therapy increased non-significantly from 80.5% to 83.2% with DeepSeek and from 70.8 to 76.1% when GPT-4.5 was provided with the World Journal of Emergency Surgery 2020 Jerusalem guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis. The estimated machine-learning model training accuracy was 84.3%, while the validation accuracy for the model was 85.0%. Discussion: GPT-4.5 and DeepSeek R1, as well as the machine-learning model, demonstrate promise in aiding surgical decision-making for appendicitis, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Ongoing training and validation are required to optimize the performance of such models."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis remains one of the most common surgical emergencies, with a lifetime incidence of approximately 7-8% in the USA and Europe. Despite the widespread adoption of the laparoscopic approach and advances made in perioperative care, post-operative infections-particularly intra-abdominal abscesses-continue to pose a substantial clinical challenge, with an overall probability that ranges from 5 to 15%. Nowadays, it is essential not only to improve patient outcomes by reducing these complications but also to promote responsible antibiotic use. This review provides an in-depth examination of post-appendectomy infections in adults, synthesizing research from the past decade. It explores the various risks involved, including those related to the patient, the disease itself, and the surgical techniques employed. There is particular emphasis on the impact of surgical approach, closure methods, timing of surgery, and intraoperative decisions such as drain placement, peritoneal lavage, and routine bacterial cultures. Part of the discussion is about emerging data regarding the use of antiseptic solutions and specimen retrieval techniques. Additionally, the review examines current approaches to managing postoperative intra-abdominal abscesses. It assesses when antibiotics are necessary, evaluates image-guided percutaneous drainage, and considers laparoscopic re-intervention as a possible solution. While recent studies offer valuable insights, the heterogeneity of available evidence highlights the pressing need for high-quality, standardized research. Ultimately, a deeper understanding of infection pathways and preventative strategies is vital-not only for reducing morbidity and hospital readmissions, but also for safeguarding the long-term efficacy of antibiotics and delivering safer, more effective surgical care."

We included all adult patients undergoing emergency laparotomy or laparoscopy for surgical gastrointestinal conditions such as perforation, obstruction, or ischaemia at Copenhagen University Hospital-Herlev from 1 November 2017 to 31 January 2020. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality, and the secondary outcome was 90-day mortality. We evaluated overall performance, discrimination and calibration with the scaled Brier score, area under the curve (AUC) and Integrated Calibration Index. We included 679 patients, of whom 13.3% (90 patients) died within 30 days. For the P-NELA prognostic model, the scaled Brier score was 18%, AUC (95% confidence interval) was 0.87 (0.83-0.90) and the Integrated Calibration Index was 0.042 for 30-day mortality. Results for the NELA risk prediction model were similar. The P-NELA prognostic model had good discrimination in this external validation. The reduced number of variables in this model compared to the previous NELA risk prediction model did not affect performance. This analysis presents testing of a simplified version of an emergency laparotomy prediction model for postoperative complications on a new and independent cohort.

This case series highlights the role of bailout laparotomy in managing life-threatening colorectal emergencies. This series presents seven patients aged 24-76 years, undergoing emergency colorectal surgery for varied conditions such as perforation (self-foreign body insertion and trauma), volvulus, malignant obstruction and inflammatory diseases. Surgical interventions included primary repair, Hartmann's procedure, diversion stomas, and tumor biopsy with decompression. Postoperative management focused on sepsis control and nutritional support, leading to favorable patient outcomes. Emergency colorectal surgery presents significant challenges due to the high risk of sepsis, hemodynamic instability, and complications associated with delayed treatment. DCS, particularly bailout laparotomy, prioritizes patient stabilization over immediate definitive repair, reducing intraoperative risks. This approach has demonstrated success in improving survival rates when minimizing postoperative morbidity care. Despite its advantages, DCS requires careful patient selection to avoid unnecessary staged interventions and prolonged hospitalizations. By allowing physiological stabilization before definitive repair, this approach enhances survival and reduces complications. The adaptation of wartime surgical principles to modern civilian practice underscores the evolving role of DCS in emergency gastrointestinal surgery."

    "abstract": "Gastric perforation remains a life-threatening condition despite advances in medical therapies and surgical techniques. In clinical emergencies involving gastric perforation, distinguishing between benign and malignant etiologies remains uncertain until histological confirmation is obtained. This study analyzed 79 patients who underwent emergency gastrectomy for gastric perforation between 2010 and 2024. Patients were categorized into ulcer and cancer groups based on pathological findings. Clinical data, including preoperative conditions and postoperative outcomes, were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses. Elderly (aged ≥75 years), symptom duration ≥48 hours, and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification IV-E were significant risk factors for postoperative mortality. The cancer group had longer operation times, while ventilator use was more common in the ulcer group. No significant differences were observed in overall mortality rates. Emergency gastrectomy can be a viable treatment for gastric perforation in regions with a high incidence of gastric cancer. However, patients with advanced age, delayed symptom onset, or poor physical status require careful surgical planning. Tailored strategies may improve outcomes, particularly in high-incidence regions for gastric cancer."

    "abstract": "Acute abdominal pain is a common yet diagnostically challenging presentation in pediatric emergency care due to nonspecific symptoms. While ultrasound offers a safe and accessible diagnostic tool, its clinical utility and correlation with laboratory markers remain understudied in many regions, including Iran. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and diagnostic value of ultrasound findings and their association with clinical and laboratory indicators. This cross-sectional study included 174 children aged 5-18 years who presented with acute abdominal pain to the emergency department of Namazi Hospital, Shiraz, Iran, between 2021 and 2022. Demographic data, clinical features, laboratory results, and ultrasound findings were recorded. Associations between sonographic abnormalities and clinical/laboratory parameters were analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. Ultrasound revealed abnormal findings in 59 (33.9%) patients. The most common sonographic diagnoses were abdominal free fluid (7.5%), appendicitis (4.6%), renal stones (2.9%), and intestinal obstruction (2.9%). Right lower quadrant pain and elevated CRP levels (> 20 mg/L) were significantly associated with appendicitis (p = 0.018 and p = 0.012, respectively). Positive urine protein and blood were significantly associated with renal stones (p = 0.01 and p = 0.003). The majority (79.3%) of ultrasounds were normal, highlighting the role of clinical assessment in determining the necessity of imaging. Ultrasound is a valuable diagnostic tool in pediatric patients with acute abdominal pain, identifying both common and rare conditions. The study highlights the importance of clinical assessment in determining the need for further imaging and the necessity of localized research to inform diagnostic protocols in regional healthcare settings."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis (AA) is the most common surgical emergency in pediatric patients, yet its diagnosis remains challenging due to variable clinical presentations and the overlap with other causes of abdominal pain. Predictive scores can enhance diagnostic accuracy, reduce unnecessary surgeries, and optimize resource utilization, especially in resource-limited settings. This study aimed to identify key predictive factors for acute appendicitis in children and to develop a combined clinical and biological scoring system to enhance diagnostic accuracy for this condition. We prospectively enrolled children aged 2 to 14 years presenting with abdominal pain to the pediatric surgery department at Fattouma Bourguiba University Hospital over a one-year period. Clinical, biological, and sonographic data were analyzed to identify key predictive factors and derive a predictive scoring model for acute appendicitis in this population. Model performance was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) on the same dataset used for model derivation. Among 420 children presenting with abdominal pain, 91 (21.7%) were diagnosed with AA. The median age of the children was 7 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.48. Binary logistic regression identified the following predictive factors: right iliac fossa tenderness, right iliac fossa guarding, positive right single-leg hop, and neutrophil percentage ≥ 75%. The predictive model achieved an AUC of 0.901 (95% CI [0.85–0.93]) with a significance of P < 0.0001. The optimal cut-off for the model was 5, yielding a sensitivity of 61.04%, specificity of 95.38%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 76.4%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 90.5%. Stratified management strategies based on the score were proposed to guide clinical decision-making effectively. The developed predictive score offers a simple, practical, and highly specific tool for diagnosing AA in pediatric emergencies. Its integration of functional signs, such as the right-sided single-leg hop test, enhances clinical utility, making it particularly valuable in resource-constrained settings. Further validations are warranted to confirm its generalizability and reliability. Not applicable. II"

    "abstract": "Due to the complexity of anatomical structure, noncompressible hemorrhage in coagulation disorders often misses the ″golden window\" of emergency treatment and becomes the key problem in trauma management. In this work, CS/ODX-G shape-memory cryogel with three-dimensional interoperable porous structure based on chitosan/oxidized dextran system was constructed by a strategy of synergistic cross-linking of dynamic Schiff base bonding and covalent bonding. The cryogel can be implanted minimally invasively with precompression technology. It swells rapidly in situ with blood triggering and utilizes elastic recoil properties to precisely conform to irregular wounds and create a dynamic mechanical compression effect. Additionally, synergistic effects of the capillary effect of multistage channels and surface amine protonation promote fibrin deposition, ultimately forming a multimode coordinated hemostatic mechanism of \"morphology adaptation-mechanical compression-coagulation regulation\". Meanwhile, cryogels exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial resistance and outstanding biocompatibility. In rat tail amputation, rat liver perforation, and normal/coagulopathic rabbit liver hemorrhage models, CS/ODX-G cryogel demonstrated excellent hemostatic efficacy and significant clinical advantages. Through multilevel structural design and coagulation pathway regulation, this work innovatively exploits cryogel that can adapt to the morphology of deep cavities and expedite the coagulation cascade, providing a hemostatic solution with rapid response and intelligent regulation for battlefield injuries (especially for patients with deep wounds and coagulopathies)."

The occurrence of double biliary-enteric fistulas (e.g., cholecysto-duodenal and cholecysto-colic) is infrequent and presents additional diagnostic and surgical challenges. A 41-year-old woman with no significant past medical history presented with progressive abdominal pain, distension, and cessation of bowel movements. Laboratory findings indicated a severe inflammatory response (CRP: 312 mg/L; leukocytosis: 13,000/mm3). CT imaging revealed jejuno-ileal distention with a calcified intraluminal mass suggestive of gallstone ileus and evidence of a cholecysto-duodenal fistula. Emergency laparotomy confirmed a large obstructing gallstone 30 cm from the ileocecal valve. Surgical exploration revealed two fistulas: cholecysto-duodenal and cholecysto-colic. The stone was removed via enterotomy; both fistulas were sutured, and a partial cholecystectomy was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful. Gallstone ileus typically affects older individuals, and its occurrence in a young patient is unusual. The presence of a double fistula is a rare complication that complicates surgical management. Early diagnosis via imaging and timely intervention are critical. In this case, a one-stage procedure involving enterotomy, fistula closure, and partial cholecystectomy was successfully performed. This case underscores the diagnostic and surgical complexity of gallstone ileus, especially when associated with double biliary-enteric fistulas. It emphasizes the importance of individualized surgical planning and the utility of CT imaging in diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is an abdominal emergency characterized by a sudden decrease in blood flow to meet the metabolic demands of bowel. AMI is uncommon but associated with high morbidity and mortality. Imaging plays a decisive role in early diagnosis and management because the symptoms of AMI are often nonspecific without specific laboratory tests or serologic biomarkers for early diagnosis. AMI comprises distinct entities with unique pathophysiology, imaging features, and management strategies. The basic causal mechanisms underlying AMI are inadequate inflow (arterial occlusion), inadequate outflow (mesenteric venous occlusion), global hypoperfusion (nonobstructive mesenteric ischemia [NOMI]), and strangulating bowel obstruction. Identifying transmural necrosis is critical for all causes of AMI. The authors review the foundational anatomy and pathophysiology of AMI, its distinct imaging features, and a systematic approach to AMI with emphasis on up-to-date imaging findings predictive of transmural necrosis. They emphasize a pathophysiology-based approach to AMI rather than a semiology-based approach (ie, patterns and signs) because the imaging features, significance, and predictive value of the imaging findings vary based on the underlying cause of AMI, with arterial occlusive AMI and NOMI having worse prognosis than mesenteric venous AMI. The authors highlight the specific vascular, bowel, and extraintestinal findings for each type of AMI with emphasis on imaging predictors of transmural bowel necrosis and address points of confusion to equip interpreting radiologists with a foundational understanding of AMI. ©RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.

The etiology remains poorly understood, and delayed presentation can result in poor outcomes. Prompt recognition and intervention are critical, particularly in patients with a remote history of bariatric surgery. A 78-year-old male (body mass index 28.73 kg/m2) with a history of RYGB performed 42 years prior presented to the emergency department with nausea, diffuse abdominal pain, and signs of septic shock. Physical examination revealed abdominal distension, peritonitis, tachycardia, and hypotension. Laboratory findings showed elevated lactate and lipase levels. Imaging demonstrated a dilated gastric remnant and free intra-abdominal fluid. Emergent exploratory laparotomy identified a necrotic gastric remnant, necessitating remnant gastrectomy. The patient initially stabilized postoperatively but developed pneumonia on postoperative day 6, followed by a duodenal stump leak. Despite conservative management, his condition deteriorated, and comfort care measures were initiated. He died on postoperative day 13. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for rare complications such as gastric remnant necrosis in patients with a history of RYGB and a low threshold for surgical exploration. Timely diagnosis and surgical intervention are essential for improving outcomes in these critically ill patients."

Currently, there is no scoring system to determine whether acute appendicitis requires surgical intervention. This study aimed to develop a scoring system for emergency surgery in acute appendicitis (SESAA). Acute appendicitis cases from five primary hospitals were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical and imaging characteristics were selected for multivariate logistic regression analysis and transformed into a scoring system. A small-scale clinical case validation was conducted. A total of 1788 cases were ultimately included, with 341 in the unnecessary operation group and 1447 in the necessary operation group. Based on clinical and imaging characteristics, a scoring system with a maximum score of 14 points was established. Patients with scores of 9 or above had a 91.9% likelihood of requiring emergency appendectomy, while 77.6% of those with scores of 4 or below could be managed with conservative treatment using antibiotics. A clinical case application test of 48 cases verified that the sensitivity and specificity of this scoring system were 94.8% and 63.6%, respectively. The scoring system aids clinicians, particularly in primary hospitals, in rapidly identifying patients who require emergency appendectomy."

    "abstract": "The unprecedented dissemination of antibiotic resistance announces a close post antibiotic era, thus exploring effective alternatives is urgent. Natural products are untapped alternatives that could offer effective alternatives with low costs. Sparastolonin B (SsnB) is a natural anthracene-derivative with a reported anti-inflammatory activity; however, its potential antibacterial activity is still under-explored. Here, we investigated both antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity of SsnB in vitro, in vivo and in silico. In vitro, SsnB showed a specific antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria with MIC range of 1-4 µg/ml against S. aureus and E. faecalis. Furthermore, it displayed a profound antibacterial activity against the clinical MRSA strain K15 in both wound infection, and peritonitis infection models with overall bacterial count reductions up to 1.21 and 1.23 log-units respectively. In addition, it has significantly improved wound healing and tissue repair rates compared to the un-treated group in wound infection model. SsnB has also significantly down-regulated the expression of inflammatory mediators, TLR-2, MCP-1, CXCL-1, CXCL-2, IL-6 and IL-1β, in the treated rabbits highlighting its potential anti-inflammatory activity. Finally, in silico analysis has predicted Gyr-B as a potential target for the observed SsnB antibacterial activity. To conclude, SsnB is a promising natural compound with a dual antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities, suggesting it as a good candidate for subsequent clinical investigation."

    "abstract": "Background: Postesophagectomy diaphragmatic hernia (PEDH) is a rare yet potentially life-threatening complication following esophagectomy, particularly when acute symptoms such as ischemia or organ perforation arise. Prompt diagnosis and emergency surgical intervention are crucial. This study reports the experience of a tertiary care center in managing acute symptomatic PEDH. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent esophagectomy for cancer at our institution between 2013 and 2023. Early PEDH was defined as hernia onset within 30 days postoperatively. Patients presenting with respiratory symptoms, volvulus, ischemia, or perforation underwent emergency surgery. Primary outcomes included the method of diaphragmatic repair, use of mesh, and surgical success. Results: Out of 358 patients, 11 (3.1%) developed PEDH requiring emergency surgery. Five cases were early PEDH and 3 developed an anastomotic leak. Organ or omental resection was performed in 4 patients. Laparoscopic repair was successful in 8 cases, while 2 patients required laparotomy and thoracotomy. Cruroplasty was performed in 8 patients, in 2 a mesh was added and in 6 the falciform ligament was used to buttress the closure. Mortality was nil. Recurrence rate was 18%. No preoperative risk factors for PEDH were identified. Conclusions: Diaphragmatic hernia is a rare but serious complication after esophagectomy, often associated with high morbidity and mortality. Early recognition is critical and life-saving. In high-volume centers, laparoscopic repair is the preferred approach and the decision to perform cruroplasty with or without mesh reinforcement should be individualized based on patient characteristics."

    "abstract": "Obstructed colon cancer (OCC) accounts for approximately 25% of colorectal cancer at the time of diagnosis and represents a surgical emergency creating a dual challenge: (i) the management of an acute mechanical colonic obstruction with potentially life-threatening consequences (fluid and electrolyte disturbances, systemic deterioration, colonic ischemia, stercoral stasis); and (ii) the treatment of an advanced primary or metastatic malignancy, often in elderly or frail patients with significant comorbidities. For right-sided OCC, right hemicolectomy with or without ileocolic anastomosis is the recommended approach, while a primary diverting ileostomy as a bridge to delayed right colectomy may be considered a safe alternative. For left-sided OCC, a diverting colostomy allows for subsequent oncological colectomy following complete disease staging and patient optimization. Hartmann's procedure should be reserved for perforated OCC, whereas (sub)total colectomy is indicated in cases of proximal colonic ischemia. In the setting of ischemia or perforation of a markedly distended proximal colon, a bowel-preserving (or colonic-sparing) strategy consisting of ileocecal resection with ileocolostomy - temporarily leaving the primary tumor in situ - may represent an alternative to (sub)total colectomy. Colonic stenting can be considered as an alternative to diverting colostomy in experienced centers. Given the poor prognosis of OCC and the high morbidity of emergency surgery - which may delay or even preclude adjuvant chemotherapy - novel treatment strategies are warranted. These include the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy during the interval between creation of a diverting stoma (ileostomy or colostomy) or colonic stent placement and subsequent elective colectomy, regardless of the primary tumor location."

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare access, potentially leading to more severe presentations of AA. This study assesses the pandemic's impact on the severity and outcomes of AA. Methods This retrospective cohort study analyzed patients diagnosed with AA at the American British Cowdray Medical Center from November 2019 to July 2020. The patients were categorized into pre-pandemic (before March 23, 2020) and post-pandemic (after March 24, 2020) groups. Demographics, laboratory findings, intraoperative classification with American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) grades I-V, histopathology, and duration of hospital stay were compared. Results Of the 192 patients included in the study, 119 were in the pre-pandemic group and 73 in the post-pandemic group. Although the post-pandemic group had longer symptom duration before hospital admission, the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.1078). However, the post-pandemic group had significantly more cases of complicated appendicitis (p=0.0012) and perforated appendicitis (p=0.0171). Histopathological analysis showed that post-pandemic patients were 1.8 times more likely to have complicated appendicitis (OR=1.8, 95% CI:1.3-2.6). The duration of hospital stay remained similar between groups (p=0.2957). Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic led to delayed AA presentation and increased disease severity.

This study aimed to determine whether the use of an oral hyperosmolar contrast agent (Gastrografin) combined with serial abdominal radiographs improves patient outcomes compared with standard management of SBO in a community hospital. A retrospective and prospective analysis was conducted of patients admitted with SBO over a two-year period. The retrospective control group included patients from January 2022 through December 2022, while the prospective group included those from January 2023 through December 2023. Exclusion criteria were emergent operative intervention, recent abdominal surgery (<30 days), and age <18 years. Patients treated with a standardized Gastrografin protocol were compared with those managed conventionally. Primary outcomes included length of stay (LOS), number of CT scans, progression to surgery, and 30-day readmission rates. Ninety patients met the inclusion criteria; 24 received the Gastrografin protocol, and 66 received standard care. The Gastrografin group had a significantly shorter LOS (2.2 ± 1.4 vs. 4.6 ± 4.2 days, p < 0.001) and underwent fewer CT scans (1.0 ± 0.0 vs. 1.4 ± 0.6, p < 0.001). Rates of surgical intervention (4.2% vs. 21.2%, p = 0.06) and 30-day readmission (12.5% vs. 15.2%, p = 1.00) did not differ significantly between groups. The findings suggest that a standardized Gastrografin protocol may reduce hospital LOS and CT utilization in the management of SBO at community hospitals."

Its diagnosis is primarily based on clinical presentation, supported by laboratory tests such as a complete blood count and imaging studies, with a non-contrast CT scan considered the gold standard. Although appendectomy is generally safe, it carries the risk of immediate and delayed complications. One such complication, stump appendicitis, is rare and often underrecognized, which can delay diagnosis and treatment. The objective of this report is to highlight the importance of considering stump appendicitis in patients with a prior history of appendectomy who present with symptoms suggestive of acute appendicitis. Prompt recognition is crucial to prevent severe complications, including peritonitis secondary to intestinal perforation, which can increase morbidity and mortality. We present the case of a 48-year-old male from Chihuahua, Mexico, who arrived at our hospital's emergency department with a four-day history of abdominal pain localized predominantly in the right iliac fossa. His medical history included an appendectomy performed several years earlier, which initially led clinicians to consider alternative diagnoses."

It is most often associated with prior abdominal surgery or laxity of anatomical attachments. We describe a diagnostically challenging case of a 21-year-old man with spastic cerebral palsy and no history of abdominal surgery who presented with classical features of large bowel obstruction. CT imaging revealed a whirlpool sign at the splenic flexure, suggestive of volvulus. However, an emergency colonoscopy showed no evidence of torsion or mucosal ischemia. Because the patient was a poor surgical candidate, he was managed conservatively. Remarkably, his symptoms resolved, and he was discharged on day five of admission. Although rare, SFV should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen, particularly in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders. Diagnostic uncertainty and delays in management may compromise patient outcomes. This case highlights a rare instance of spontaneous detorsion, underscoring the challenges of diagnosis, monitoring, and decision-making in a high-risk, noncommunicative patient, while also providing insights into radiographic findings, natural disease course, and recurrence risk."

Enzymatic assays confirmed that NDGA effectively inhibits FIPV 3CLpro activity. Furthermore, cellular assays demonstrated that NDGA suppresses FIPV replication. Additionally, in a feline challenge model with an FCoV-II strain, NDGA treatment prolonged survival and improved clinical outcomes. These results support NDGA as a potential lead compound for FIP therapy."

    "abstract": "Intestinal obstruction is a common surgical emergency; however, faecolith-induced obstruction is exceptionally rare, especially in the small intestine. This case series highlights an uncommon etiology of small bowel obstruction(SBO), with an emphasis on diagnostic challenges, surgical management, and patient outcomes. We report three cases of SBO due to faecolith impaction: two geriatric and one pediatric patient. All presented with symptoms of abdominal distention, colicky pain, and failure to pass stool. Imaging, particularly contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of abdomen and pelvis revealed dilated small bowel loops with transition point and intraluminal hyperdense masses suggestive of faecolith-induced SBO, including one case of secondary small bowel obstruction due to a caecal faecolith. Emergency Surgical interventions included enterotomy in two cases and cecotomy in one, with one patient requiring a loop ileostomy due to bowel edema. All patients recovered uneventfully and were discharged between postoperative day (POD) 5 to 8. Faecolith-induced SBO is an uncommon but important differential diagnosis, particularly in patients with no prior history of abdominal surgery. In such case early imaging with CECT is crucial for diagnosis. Timely and appropriate surgical intervention results in excellent outcomes and helps prevent complications such as ischemia or perforation. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for faecolith-induced SBO in patients with typical features of bowel obstruction but no history of prior abdominal surgery. Prompt diagnosis and operative management can lead to favorable outcomes."

    "title": "Alveolar Echinococcosis Mimicking Perihilar Cholangiocarcinoma Leading to Liver Transplant: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a slowly progressive parasitic disease that primarily affects the liver and resembles primary or secondary liver neoplasms. Differentiating AE from other primary or secondary liver malignancies is of paramount importance, due to differing therapeutic approaches. The disease is uncommon in developed countries. Initial extrahepatic manifestation mimicking a primary biliary neoplasm is extremely rare. A broad differential diagnosis and low disease prevalence make the diagnosis of primary biliary AE extremely challenging. CASE REPORT We present a 32-year-old male patient with perihilar AE and no significant past medical history. The initial clinical presentation and radiological findings were compatible with the diagnosis of perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor). The patient subsequently underwent extensive invasive diagnostic procedures, including endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which led to choledochal perforation and biliary leakage, necessitating urgent surgical procedure, along with exploration, evacuation of enlarged lymph nodes, and subsequent histopathological examination. None of the procedures provided definitive evidence of malignancy. Only an ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsy followed by histopathological examination revealed AE. Albendazole treatment and close follow-up were initiated. Subsequently, the patient experienced recurrent episodes of acute cholangitis. Recurrent cholangitis and perihilar biliary involvement, precluding radical surgical resection, necessitated liver transplantation. Ultimately, the patient underwent orthotopic liver transplantation from a brain-dead donor, with a favorable outcome. CONCLUSIONS Liver transplantation is a definitive treatment option for selected patients with perihilar liver involvement precluding radical resection of parasitic mass and recurrent episodes of acute cholangitis."

    "title": "A Case of a Perforated Duodenal Ulcer in the Context of Acute Tubular Necrosis and Urosepsis.",
    "abstract": "Duodenal ulcer perforation is a life-threatening complication of peptic ulcer disease (PUD), often manifesting with acute abdominal symptoms. However, PUD itself can be asymptomatic, potentially delaying diagnosis, particularly in individuals without recognized pre-existing gastrointestinal conditions. While Helicobacter pylori infection and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are well-established primary risk factors for PUD, the condition can also develop in the absence of these common triggers or due to other less apparent causes. This report details the case of an 80-year-old male with chronic kidney disease stage 3A and a recent complicated urinary tract infection (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli) who presented with confusion and increased urinary frequency. His initial evaluation revealed acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to severe dehydration and metabolic acidosis, which then progressed to urosepsis and ischemic acute tubular necrosis. Unexpectedly, during his hospital admission, he developed a sudden anterior duodenal ulcer perforation. His condition was managed successfully with an emergency exploratory laparotomy and surgical repair, followed by postoperative hemodialysis, leading to a full recovery without complications from the ulcer repair. As this patient lacked typical PUD risk factors, the ulcer was likely idiopathic in origin, with its acute presentation likely exacerbated by AKI-associated uremia, metabolic acidosis, and the physiological stress of his critical illness. This case underscores the importance of recognizing stress-related risk factors for peptic ulcer formation in critically ill patients with AKI, as prophylactic measures recommended to prevent stress ulcer bleeding may also help reduce the risk of life-threatening complications such as perforation."

    "title": "The Many Faces of Meckel's Diverticulum: Clinical Presentations and Complications.",
    "abstract": "Background Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is a congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract characterized as a true diverticulum that contains all three layers of the intestinal wall. It is typically situated on the antimesenteric border of the terminal ileum and receives blood supply from the vitelline artery. Although often asymptomatic, MD can lead to complications such as intestinal obstruction, gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation with peritonitis, and, rarely, malignancy. Histologically, ectopic gastric and pancreatic tissues are the most commonly observed findings. Methods This retrospective study reviewed pediatric cases of symptomatic MD treated between June 2022 and May 2025. Data regarding clinical presentation, operative procedures, histopathological findings, and treatment outcomes were analyzed. Results The average age at presentation was 40 months, ranging from one to 60 months. Among the six children studied, two (33%) presented with umbilical discharge, and two (33%) had intestinal obstruction, one (16%) of whom had associated bowel gangrene. These four (64%) patients underwent laparotomy with ileal resection and anastomosis. One (16%) child presented with perforation peritonitis due to a ruptured MD and required an emergency ileostomy, later reversed after eight months. One (16%) child, who had intermittent lower gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia, underwent laparoscopy-assisted Meckel's diverticulectomy. Histopathology revealed ectopic gastric mucosa in five (84%) patients and pancreatic tissue in one (16%) patient; no malignancy was identified. Conclusion Prompt surgical resection with restoration of bowel continuity is crucial in cases of symptomatic MD. Although resection of incidentally discovered MD during unrelated abdominal procedures is sometimes considered due to its potential for future complications, including bleeding or malignancy, there is currently insufficient evidence to support the routine removal of asymptomatic MD in the absence of other abdominal pathology."

    "abstract": "A strangulated inguinal hernia is a common surgical emergency with high morbidity and mortality. Patient delay in seeking treatment is a critical factor that increases surgical complexity and worsens prognosis. A 59-year-old male presented with a two-hour history of acute, excruciating pain in his left scrotum and signs of bowel obstruction. He had a two-year history of a neglected, reducible inguinoscrotal hernia. Examination revealed a strangulated hernia with systemic signs of distress, including severe hypertension (170/120 mmHg) and tachycardia (119 bpm). Emergency surgery confirmed a strangulated left inguinal hernia containing congested ileal loops and dense adhesions resulting from the chronic nature of the hernia. The bowel was successfully preserved after meticulous adhesiolysis, and a Lichtenstein mesh repair was performed. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course. Patient delay is the primary determinant of morbidity in strangulated hernias. The chronic presence of the hernia led to the formation of dense adhesions, significantly increasing the surgical complexity and operative risk compared to an elective repair. The management highlights the critical intraoperative assessment of bowel viability and the nuanced decision to use prosthetic mesh in a potentially contaminated field, aligning with current guidelines when bowel resection is not required. The case underscores that neglecting a hernia transforms a low-risk condition into a life-threatening emergency. Neglecting an inguinal hernia leads to preventable, life-threatening complications. This case emphasizes the critical importance of patient education to promote timely elective surgery to prevent the significant morbidity and mortality associated with strangulated hernias."

The aim of this study was to develop an antibacterial wound dressing based on chitosan lactate (CL)/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) composite sponges, prepared via a freeze-drying process without the use of toxic crosslinking agents, and to evaluate their hemostatic effectiveness in controlling femoral artery bleeding in an animal model. The CL/PVA sponges exhibited a crystalline, interconnected porous structure with a mean pore size of 120 µm. A swelling ratio of approximately 500% was observed, and the sponges were almost completely degraded after 7 d of incubation in simulated body fluid. The composite sponges showed antibacterial activity of 99% against Escherichia coli and 33% against Staphylococcus aureus. In a femoral artery perforation test, CL/PVA sponges effectively stopped bleeding within 59.62 ± 11.89 s, whereas the control group required 117.5 ± 3.25 s - a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001). Characterizing the properties of this material in relation to blood coagulation physiology suggests its potential for controlling life-threatening hemorrhages in emergency situation."

    "abstract": "Keratitis an inflammatory disorder of the corneal tissue, poses a significant threat to vision and, if left untreated, can even progress to irreversible blindness. Clinical manifestations of the disease include ocular redness, pain, photophobia, excessive tearing, and visual disturbances, with severe cases often leading to corneal ulceration, scarring, or perforation. The global prevalence of keratitis exhibits substantial geographical variability, largely influenced by access to healthcare, environmental factors, and behavioral risk determinants, most notably, the use of contact lenses. In recent years, microbial keratitis (MK) has shown a concerning rise in incidence, particularly among contact lens users, frequently attributed to improper lens hygiene and extended wear. Current therapy mainly depends on the intensive use of topical antimicrobial agents; however, the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens and the protective nature of biofilms significantly compromise therapeutic efficacy and efficiency. These limitations pave the way to the urgent need for alternative strategies. Bacteriophage therapy, which was in use even before the development of antibiotics, regained interest as a precision-based antibacterial treatment that is capable of selectively targeting pathogenic bacteria, including MDR strains, without disrupting the native ocular microbiota or damaging host tissue. This review explores the different types of keratitis and pathogenesis, highlights the problems related to conventional therapies, and emphasizes the potential of phage therapy as a novel, adjunctive, or standalone intervention. WHAT IS KNOWN : Microbial keratitis (MK) is a serious ocular infection that can lead to blindness, with rising prevalence among contact lens users. The effectiveness of conventional antimicrobial therapy is increasingly compromised by multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens and biofilm-associated protection. Bacteriophage therapy offers a promising, targeted approach against MDR pathogens in microbial keratitis without disrupting the native ocular microbiota. Phages can penetrate biofilms and have the potential to act as adjunctive or standalone treatments where antibiotics fail. This review underscores phage therapy as a viable alternative and brings attention to its renewed relevance in ophthalmic infectious disease management."

    "abstract": "Esophageal perforation is a rare but critical emergency that requires early detection and prompt management. Iatrogenic esophageal injury is the most common cause of esophageal perforation in children, and most cases occur during endoscopic dilatation of strictures. There are various options available for the management of iatrogenic esophageal perforation, such as conservative management, endoscopic interventions, or surgical interventions. Surgical interventions for esophageal perforation have a high risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality. Endoscopic metal stenting is one of the minimally invasive treatment options for the management of esophageal perforation. However, this procedure is rarely implemented in the pediatric population due to the unavailability of appropriately size-matched endoscopic accessories. Here, we report a case of a 22-month-old male child born with a tracheoesophageal fistula, who underwent corrective surgery twice and developed anastomotic site esophageal stricture. The patient developed esophageal perforation during endoscopic dilatation of the stricture and was managed successfully with a biliary fully covered self-expandable metal stent."

    "abstract": "Laparoscopic surgery is a standard approach for many elective gastrointestinal procedures but remains underutilized for emergent small bowel obstruction (SBO) resolution. This study evaluates how preoperative factors influence the initial choice of laparoscopic versus open surgery for SBO, and how intra-operative events may modify the initial operative approach and impact outcomes. Prospective, multicenter, multinational time-bound observational study of SBO patients. Preoperative data and operative details were collected. Primary outcome was initial surgical approach (laparoscopic or open). Secondary outcomes included conversion to open and post-operative complications. Uni- and multivariable analyses identified predictors of approach selection and conversion. Of 1737 patients, 876 (50.4%) underwent surgery with 172 (19.6%) initially explored using laparoscopy; 60 (34.8%) of those cases converted to open. Laparoscopy was initially pursued in younger patients (mean 60.9 ± 18.2 vs. 66.5 ± 17.5 years, p < 0.001), with fewer comorbidities (66.3% vs. 75.1%, p = 0.018), and less frequent prior abdominal surgery (43.6% vs. 29.8%, p < 0.001) or multiple previous operations (mean 1.5 ± 1 vs. 1.9 ± 1.3, p = 0.03). Presumed etiology influenced approach: laparoscopy was more frequently utilized for adhesive single-band obstructions (60.5% vs. 45.2%), whereas open surgery was more common for hernias (24.4% vs. 38.1%). Both abdominal malignancy (OR = 4.74, p = 0.015) and free intraperitoneal fluid on CT (OR = 6.79, p < 0.001) surfaced as independent predictors of conversion. Laparoscopy was associated with fewer complications (surgical: 13.9% vs. 23.1%, p = 0.009; medical: 9.8% vs. 20.7%, p = 0.001) and lower mortality (0.6% vs. 8.3%, p < 0.001) than open surgery. Preoperative patient factors and disease etiology are associated with initial operative technique selection, while intraoperative events and findings appear to adjust the probability of conversion to open. Preoperative assessment combined with flexibility in intraoperative decision-making appears to be associated with optimal outcomes in SBO management."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common pediatric surgical emergency, but its clinical presentation can overlap with other conditions, complicating diagnosis. We present a case of a 4-year-old female who initially presented with symptoms suggestive of appendicitis, including right iliac fossa pain, vomiting, and fever. Imaging studies were inconclusive, and a laparoscopic appendectomy was performed. No signs of appendicitis were found, but vasculitic changes were noted in a segment of the ileum. Postoperatively, the patient developed a mild purpuric rash, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels prompted further investigation. Subsequent laboratory tests and clinical findings led to a diagnosis of Immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis, characterized by a small-vessel vasculitis affecting the gastrointestinal tract. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges when presenting symptoms mimic appendicitis but are ultimately attributed to an atypical presentation of IgA vasculitis. The importance of considering systemic inflammatory conditions like IgA vasculitis in pediatric abdominal pain is emphasized, especially when initial diagnoses do not align with imaging or surgical findings. A multidisciplinary approach, including rheumatological evaluation, was crucial in securing the correct diagnosis and managing the patient's care. IgA vasculitis (IgAV) is a condition that causes inflammation of small blood vessels. It can often affect the skin, joints, kidneys, and digestive system. This condition usually involves the upper part of the small intestine, but in rare cases, it can affect the very end of the small intestine (terminal ileum). In our case, a patient came to the hospital with sudden, severe abdominal pain and imaging that suggested a localized bowel problem. Surgeons operated urgently, and only later (when a skin rash appeared) IgAV was diagnosed. The patient recovered quickly after starting steroid treatment, without needing further bowel procedures. This case shows that IgAV can sometimes look like a surgical emergency. By being aware of this possibility, we can prevent unnecessary surgery and guide treatment decisions."

    "abstract": "Esophageal button battery impactions represent a life-threatening medical emergency in children. There are established clinical benchmarks to help reduce the risk of injury. Our objective was to describe the care pathways of children presenting with esophageal button battery impactions in the four main pediatric centers in Ontario. A multi-institutional health records review of button battery ingestion cases in children from 2012 to 2023 at four large-volume tertiary pediatric hospitals was conducted. Participants included children under 18 years who underwent esophagoscopy for battery removal. Eighty-six children with button battery impactions were identified. The median age was 2.6 years. Fifteen children presented directly to a tertiary institution, while 71 (82.6%) were transferred from a community hospital. The median total distance traveled was 44.6 km. The median time from button battery diagnosis to removal was 7.9 h. Honey or sucralfate was administered in < 5% of cases. The median hospital stay was 3.1 days. Complications included esophageal perforation (2.3%), esophageal stricture (8.5%), tracheoesophageal fistula (1.2%), and vascular injury (1.2%), with one death reported. No cases met the benchmark of button battery removal within 2 h of ingestion, with significant delays occurring at every management stage. Despite efforts to increase awareness and rapid management of button battery ingestion, significant delays, poor adherence to mitigation strategies, and serious complications persist. These findings emphasize the need for prevention and the development of regional and institution-specific protocols to provide timely and streamlined care. RéSUMé: INTRODUCTION: Les impacts de batterie bouton œsophagienne représentent une urgence médicale potentiellement mortelle chez les enfants. Il existe des points de référence cliniques établis pour aider à réduire le risque de blessure. Notre objectif était de décrire les parcours de soins des enfants présentant des impactes de batterie bouton œsophagienne dans les quatre principaux centres pédiatriques en Ontario. MéTHODES: Un examen des dossiers de santé multi-établissements sur les cas d’ingestion de piles boutons chez les enfants entre 2012 et 2023 dans quatre hôpitaux pédiatriques tertiaires à grand volume a été réalisé. Les participants comprenaient des enfants de moins de 18 ans qui ont subi une œsophagoscopie pour le retrait des piles. RéSULTATS : Quatre-vingt-six enfants avec des impacts de batterie bouton ont été identifiés. L’âge médian était de 2,6 ans. Quinze enfants se sont présentés directement dans un établissement tertiaire, tandis que 71 (82,6 %) ont été transférés d’un hôpital communautaire. La distance totale médiane parcourue était de 44,6 km. Le temps médian entre le diagnostic de la batterie bouton et son retrait était de 7,9 heures. Le miel ou le sucralfate a été administré dans <5 % des cas. La durée médiane d’hospitalisation était de 3,1 jours. Les complications comprenaient une perforation de l’œsophage (2,3 %), une sténose de l’œsophage (8,5 %), une fistule trachéoœsophagienne (1,2 %) et une lésion vasculaire (1,2 %), avec un décès signalé. Aucun cas n’a atteint le repère de retrait de la batterie du bouton dans les deux heures suivant l’ingestion, avec des retards significatifs à chaque étape de gestion. CONCLUSION: Malgré les efforts pour accroître la sensibilisation et la gestion rapide de l’ingestion des piles boutons, des retards importants, une mauvaise adhérence aux stratégies d’atténuation et des complications graves persistent. Ces résultats soulignent la nécessité de prévenir et d’élaborer des protocoles régionaux et propres à chaque établissement pour fournir des soins rationalisés en temps opportun."

A 26-year-old male presented with acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain and vomiting. He had a similar episode seven years prior that self-resolved. Physical examination revealed generalized abdominal tenderness, guarding, and mild distention. Imaging studies, including abdominal ultrasound and CECT, confirmed midgut volvulus due to nonrotation. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and Ladd's procedure, leading to an uneventful recovery and discharge on postoperative day seven. A comprehensive PubMed search was conducted for case reports on midgut nonrotation in adults. 15 relevant cases were selected, and including the present case, 16 cases were reviewed. The mean age at presentation was 55.19 years (range: 26-86), with a slight male predominance (56.2%). The most common symptoms were acute abdominal pain (50%) and vomiting (31.25%). Notably, 50% of cases were identified incidentally during evaluations for unrelated conditions or procedures. CT scans confirmed diagnoses in 87.5% of cases. Positional anomalies included right-sided small bowel and left-sided colon in 37.5% and reversed SMA/SMV relationships in 33%. Ladd's procedure was performed in 25% of cases. Midgut nonrotation, resulting from abnormal embryonic bowel rotation, can occur at any age, more commonly in males. It may present as a surgical emergency due to bowel obstruction and volvulus or remain asymptomatic throughout life. CT imaging and surgical intervention, particularly Ladd's procedure, are effective management strategies. The frequent incidental discovery of cases suggests that asymptomatic nonrotation may be more prevalent than clinically recognized."

While acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency, especially among young people, older patients may exhibit atypical symptoms that conceal a more severe pathology. The main objective of this article is to highlight the diagnostic challenges and therapeutic implications of cecal adenocarcinoma that mimics acute appendicitis. We describe the clinical presentation, diagnostic workup, intraoperative findings, and postoperative course of a 74-year-old female patient who had symptoms compatible with acute appendicitis. Despite preoperative imaging indicating appendicitis, the surgical investigation revealed a cecal tumor, prompting a right hemicolectomy. The initial investigation revealed localized RLQ pain and leukocytosis, along with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Imaging studies indicated retrocecal inflammation and cecal distention. The intraoperative evaluation revealed a grossly normal appendix but a firm cecal mass. A right hemicolectomy was performed. Histopathology revealed a moderately differentiated cecal adenocarcinoma classified as pT3N0Mx. The patient's recovery went smoothly, and she was discharged on postoperative day 7 with an oncology referral. Cecal carcinoma can manifest as acute appendicitis in elderly patients, necessitating a high level of suspicion and careful intraoperative evaluation. Prompt conversion to definitive oncologic surgery, as proven, enables correct diagnosis and timely treatment. Surgeons should be extra cautious, especially in patients over 40, and perform appropriate postoperative screening in search of underlying malignancies."

While open repair has long been the standard, laparoscopic repair is increasingly adopted for its minimally invasive advantages. This systematic review, conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines and registered with PROSPERO (CRD420251117651), compared outcomes of laparoscopic versus open repair in adult patients with perforated duodenal ulcers. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library identified comparative studies published between January 2000 and December 2024. Six studies involving 739 patients met the inclusion criteria. Outcomes assessed included operative time, conversion rate, length of hospital stay (LOS), post-operative complications, leak rate, and mortality. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (RoB-2) tool for the single randomized controlled trial and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies. Laparoscopic repair was consistently associated with shorter LOS (4.0-7.8 versus 7.8-11.7 days), lower complication rates (5.8-13% versus 8.6-44.3%), and reduced mortality (0-1.8% versus 0-27.9%) compared with open repair, while leak rates were comparable (0-7% versus 1.4-4.9%). Conversion to open surgery occurred in 0-17.8% of laparoscopic cases. Operative times were longer in earlier studies but equivalent or shorter in more recent work. Risk of bias ranged from low to moderate. In conclusion, laparoscopic repair is a safe and effective alternative to open repair, offering a faster recovery and lower morbidity without increasing the risk of leaks. Open repair remains essential for unstable patients or those with severe contamination. Further multicentre randomized trials with standardized outcome reporting are warranted to confirm these benefits and define optimal patient selection."

    "title": "The Diagnostic Uncertainties and Legal Precedents in Appendicitis Malpractice.",
    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the commonest surgical emergency, yet its presentation can be atypical, often resembling non-urgent conditions. Delayed or missed diagnosis of appendicitis carries not only clinical risk but also significant legal exposure. Retrospective analyses of malpractice claims have long identified appendicitis as one of the top causes of emergency department malpractice suits. This article explores the medicolegal landscape surrounding appendicitis, highlighting common diagnostic errors, the transformative impact of widespread computed tomography (CT) use, and recent verdicts. It also examines the key legal principles involved in such cases, with a focus on how diagnostic uncertainty and communication breakdowns in the emergency department (ED) affect radiologists. Finally, we emphasize the radiologist's duty to clearly report imaging findings and to ensure critical results are communicated to the treating clinician, using a closed-loop communication system. Ultimately, both radiologists and emergency providers must stay alert to the varied manifestations of appendicitis and follow established imaging and follow-up protocols to enhance patient care and mitigate medicolegal exposure."

    "abstract": "Intussusception, where 1 intestinal segment invaginates into another, causes bowel obstruction and ischemia in children, diagnosed via ultrasound. Early identification of patients requiring ultrasound for intussusception diagnosis is essential. This study aims to develop a clinical prediction model for intussusception based on solely history, symptoms, and physical examination to identify patients needing ultrasound evaluation. This prospective observational study (September 2019-February 2024) in a pediatric emergency department, included children under 6 with suspected intussusception. Logistic regression identified predictors, and a clinical prediction model was developed. Diagnostic performance was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Out of 83 patients, 29 (34.9%) were diagnosed with intussusception. Key predictors were absence of fever (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.4), intermittent abdominal pain or irritability (aOR 3.4), absence of diarrhea (aOR 8.0), and right upper quadrant (RUQ) tenderness (aOR 8.2). The model, which includes absence of fever (1 point), intermittent abdominal pain or irritability (1 point), absence of diarrhea (2 points), and RUQ tenderness (2 points), demonstrated 66% sensitivity, 83% specificity, 68% PPV, 81.5% NPV, and an AUROC of 0.78, achieving 100% sensitivity and NPV at a threshold score of ≥1 point. The prediction model, based on absence of fever, intermittent abdominal pain/irritability, absence of diarrhea, and RUQ tenderness, effectively identifies children at risk for intussusception. It supports timely ultrasound decisions in children with ambiguous abdominal symptoms, improving patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Ileocolic intussusception is the most common cause of bowel obstruction in young children. There is an ongoing debate about whether it is a middle-of-the-night emergency and if delays in intervention have a significant impact on outcome. To determine the relationship between the time elapsed from diagnosis to pneumatic reduction and the success rate of the procedure. A retrospective study was performed on pediatric patients who underwent fluoroscopically guided pneumatic intussusception reduction during a 10-year period. Patients were categorized into groups according to the time elapsed between diagnosis and reduction with the following time intervals: ≤ 3 h, 3-6 h, and > 6 h. A chi-square test analyzed the association between the time elapsed from diagnosis to attempted reduction and the success rate. The study population consisted of 78 males and 38 females. Median age was 22.5 months (2-129 months). Median time elapsed between diagnosis and attempted reduction was 149 min (25-1389 min; IQR, 261 min). The overall success rate of pneumatic reduction was 85% (108/127, 95% CI 79-91%). The recurrence rate was 9.4% (95% CI 4.2-15%). Within the three intervals studied (0-3 h, 3-6 h, and more than 6 h), the success rates were 87% (61/70, 95% CI 77-93%), 80% (24/30, 95% CI 63-90%), and 85% (23/27, 95% CI 68-94%), respectively. The chi-square test yielded a statistic of 0.84 with a P-value of 0.66, indicating no significant correlation between the time elapsed from diagnosis to reduction and the success of the procedure. There is no association between the time elapsed from ileocolic intussusception diagnosis to pneumatic reduction and the success of the procedure."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Diverticular disease is common in Western countries, and the frequency of emergency operations for acute left-sided complicated diverticulitis (ALCD) has increased over the past 15 years. Methods: A total of 49 patients aged over 80 years and 125 younger patients who underwent emergency surgery for ALCD between October 2018 and June 2025 were analyzed. Demographics and postoperative outcomes were compared between the groups. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the association between age and postoperative morbidity and mortality. A separate regression model was used to identify risk factors for postoperative mortality and morbidity, specifically in elderly patients. Results: Significant differences between the two groups were found in sex distribution (p < 0.001), cardiovascular comorbidities (p < 0.001), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) (p < 0.001), ASA score (p < 0.001), ALCD severity according to the modified Hinchey classification (p = 0.006), Mannheim Peritonitis Index (MPI) (p = 0.021), postoperative complications (p < 0.001), and 90-day mortality rates (p < 0.001). Advanced age was a significant predictor of 90-day postoperative mortality and morbidity. In the elderly subgroup, an ASA score ≥ 3, MPI > 25, CRI, and COPD were identified as independent predictors of 90-day postoperative mortality and morbidity. Conclusions: Advanced age is an independent risk factor for 90-day postoperative mortality and morbidity following emergency surgery for ALCD. In patients over 80 years, an ASA score ≥ 3, CRI, COPD, and MPI ≥ 25 are associated with a poorer prognosis."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO) accounts for 15% of emergency department (ED) admissions. While conservative management is recommended, surgery becomes necessary when strangulation is suspected. Identifying which patients need surgery remains a challenge, as traditional imaging lacks sufficient sensitivity and specificity. This study aimed to explore radiomic features to identify potential predictors of strangulation. Methods: This retrospective study included patients admitted to a tertiary referral hospital ED between 2019 and 2023, diagnosed with Adhesion Small Bowel Obstruction (aSBO) via contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scans. Two patient groups were examined: those who underwent surgery with bowel resection and ischemic changes confirmed histologically (operative management-OM) and those successfully treated with conservative management (CM). All CT scans were reviewed blindly by a general surgeon and an experienced radiologist. Pre-obstructive loop segmentation was performed using 3D Slicer software, with slice-by-slice contouring of intestinal borders on images of suspected strangulated bowel. Radiomic features were extracted, followed by univariate and multivariate regression analysis. Results: A total of 55 patients were included: 27 CM and 28 OM. Significant differences emerged in GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix), GLDM (Gray Level Dependence Matrix), GLRLM (Gray Level Run Length Matrix), and GLSZM (Gray Level Size Zone Matrix), particularly involving entropy and uniformity. These metrics reflect subtle variations in gray levels not visible to the naked eye. Conclusions: Differences in entropy, uniformity, and energy align with imaging and histopathological findings, supporting the development of radiomic models and future AI-based prediction tools."

    "abstract": "The incidence of intentional foreign body ingestion is rising in the UK, with water-absorbent polymer beads (WAPBs) increasingly implicated in children. While commonly used in horticulture and as toys, WAPBs can pose serious risks when ingested. This report details a unique case of massive WAPB ingestion in an adult, emphasizing the potential complications and management challenges. A 60-year-old male presented with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting after ingesting an estimated 25,000 WAPBs. CT imaging showed a massive volume of WAPBs throughout the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and free fluid around the duodenum likely due to reactive pancreatitis. An emergency laparotomy was performed due to the risk of impending perforation. At laparotomy, a gastrostomy and 2 enterotomies were made to remove as many WAPBs as possible. A loop ileostomy was formed due to ongoing retention of the beads and risk of obstruction. Post-operatively, the patient was placed on total parenteral nutrition and the remaining WAPBs passed through the ileostomy. Further imaging revealed ongoing pancreatitis and a peripancreatic collection, which was managed conservatively. The patient was discharged two months after surgery. This case represents the first documented instance of massive WAPB ingestion in an adult. It highlights the significant risks associated with ingesting large quantities of WAPBs, including GI obstruction and pancreatitis. Early surgical intervention was critical in preventing further complications, as endoscopic removal was impractical given the volume. Massive ingestion of WAPBs poses significant health risks and may necessitate prompt surgical management. This case underscores the importance of timely intervention to prevent severe outcomes associated with large volumes of ingested WAPBs."

    "abstract": "Recurrent small bowel obstruction (SBO) can result in significant morbidity and mortality. In this study, we aimed to compare readmission and its impact on operatively and nonoperatively managed patients admitted with SBO. We performed a retrospective analysis using the National Readmission Database 2016-2017 and included all patients (≥ 18y) who were non-elective admissions for SBO during the index hospitalization. Patients were dichotomized into two groups: Operative group (OM) and nonoperative group (NOM). Primary outcomes included rates of readmission and mortality upon readmission. Secondary outcomes included complications, which were defined as fistula, abscess, perforation, peritonitis, and sepsis. 122,778 patients admitted for SBO were included. Overall, the readmission was 29.8%, with 34.4% readmitted within 30 days. 6.4% were OM, while 93.6% were NOM during index admission. Among OM patients, the readmission rate was significantly lower at 28.6% compared to NOM at 29.9% (p < 0.001). Among the readmitted NOM patients, 88.3% had emergency readmissions, with 10.6% requiring operative intervention. Adjusted analyses revealed that NOM had 32% higher odds of readmission (p < 0.001). Other factors increasing the odds of readmission included female sex, a high Charlson comorbidity index, and an admission diagnosis of cancer. Among readmitted patients, NOM had 50% higher odds of mortality during readmission. Each readmission raised the odds of mortality by 4.0% (p < 0.001). Operative management in the first readmission was associated with younger age, private insurance status, and non-operative management during the index admission. While cost, length of stay, and complications were higher in OM, NOM was associated with a higher readmission rate and mortality upon readmission. Each additional readmission for small bowel obstruction increased the odds of mortality by 4.0%."

This report discusses a unique case of a 36-year-old female who developed a de novo incarcerated ventral hernia in the left iliac fossa, following a road traffic accident. The herniation involved a segment of small bowel entrapped in the defect, along with mesenteric tears and hemoperitoneum. The patient underwent emergency laparotomy, during which bowel viability was confirmed and primary repair of the defect was performed without bowel resection. The case emphasizes the importance of timely diagnosis and intervention in complicated trauma-related hernias to avoid further deterioration of the condition, like strangulation."

    "abstract": "Coronary obstruction is a rare but potentially fatal complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement, particularly in patients with high-risk anatomy. Prophylactic techniques such as chimney stenting and intentional leaflet laceration have been developed to prevent acute coronary obstruction; however, delayed coronary obstruction (DCO) remains a serious concern. We present a 76-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis, low coronary height, and an elongated native left coronary cusp. Preprocedural computed tomography and virtual simulation revealed a near-zero valve-to-sinotubular junction distance, predicting unavoidable obstruction. Despite chimney stenting during self-expanding valve deployment, progressive valve frame expansion caused late chimney stent occlusion. Emergent revascularization was achieved by mechanically perforating the entrapped native leaflet, followed by fenestration stenting. This case highlights the limitations of conventional coronary protection in preventing DCO. It demonstrates that percutaneous leaflet perforation with fenestration stenting may serve as a potentially feasible bailout strategy in this high-risk setting."

    "abstract": "While the clinical and radiological symptoms of peptic ulcer perforation in cases of so-called \"normal\" anatomy are well established, this is less so in cases where the stomach has been excluded, as after gastric bypass. Indeed, in these cases, the initial clinical signs are often subtle and nonspecific. So, too, as are the laboratory findings, which often, in the initial phase, do not reveal an inflammatory syndrome and sometimes present with a misleading elevation of serum lipase. Also, pneumoperitoneum is often absent on imaging. Thus, after gastric bypass and when there is a history of Helicobacter pylori infection, active smoking, or NSAID use, the appearance of intense abdominal pain with abdominal tenderness and guarding, and the presence of peritoneal effusion (possibly bilious), despite the absence of pneumoperitoneum, should raise the suspicion of ulcer perforation in an excluded stomach, which requires urgent exploratory laparoscopy to avoid treatment delay."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a condition commonly seen in the emergency department (ED). Therefore, it is important for emergency medicine clinicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of this disease. This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning appendicitis in the adult patient for the emergency clinician. Acute appendicitis can present with a variety of signs and symptoms in adults, and no single history or examination finding can exclude the diagnosis of appendicitis. The presence of right lower quadrant pain or tenderness, migrating pain, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, and obturator sign are suggestive of the diagnosis. A combination of normal white blood cell count, neutrophil distribution, and c-reactive protein suggest appendicitis is less likely. Several risk stratification tools are available, including the original and modified Alvarado score, the Appendicitis Inflammatory Response (AIR) score, the Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha Appendicitis (RIPASA) score, and the Adult Appendicitis Score (AAS). Current evidence and guidelines suggest the AIR, AAS, and RIPASA have the highest diagnostic accuracy. Patients determined to be low risk on these scores may not require further diagnostic evaluation when used with shared decision-making. Patients who are not low risk warrant further investigation. A variety of imaging tests are available, including computed tomography (CT), ultrasound (US), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). US or CT may be used as the first-line imaging modality in adults. US and MRI are the recommended imaging tests in pregnant females. All patients with acute appendicitis should receive surgical consultation, and antibiotics should be administered. Evidence suggests that non-operative management with antibiotics alone may be safe in select patients with uncomplicated appendicitis, particularly those without appendicolith. Surgical intervention is recommended in pregnancy. An understanding of literature updates can improve the ED care of patients with appendicitis."

She had a history of exploratory laparotomy in 2015 for blunt abdominal trauma. The diagnosis of IO in pregnancy was confirmed via abdominopelvic ultrasound and clinical findings. Interventions included conservative measures (nasogastric tube decompression, enemas) followed by emergency laparotomy with bowel resection/anastomosis. Despite surgical management, the patient succumbed to septic shock. High clinical suspicion, expedited cross-sectional imaging (computed tomography/Magnetic resonance imaging), and emergent surgery are critical to reduce mortality."

    "abstract": "Perforated diverticulitis is a critical surgical emergency that demands immediate attention and intervention. Damage control surgery (DCS) has emerged as an alternative to traditional approaches for managing physiologically unstable and critically ill patients. This systematic review includes 16 articles published between 2015 and 2025, covering randomized controlled trials, observational cohorts, case reports, and guidelines. The inclusion and exclusion criteria focused on human studies published in English that addressed managing perforated diverticulitis with DCS. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines were used to guide article selection, which was further refined using standardized appraisal tools such as A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2), the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), Joanna Briggs Institute Checklists (JBI), the Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) tool, the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II), and the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES). This review highlights DCS as an effective approach for managing perforated diverticulitis. Patient management with DCS showed significant improvement compared to traditional methods such as Hartmann's procedure. Physiological stabilization reduced complications such as stoma formation and improved anastomosis rates, as supported by the included studies. The findings suggest that DCS reduces morbidity and mortality, lowers the need for a stoma, and enhances bowel continuity in patients with perforated diverticulitis. Several studies also employed negative pressure therapy for temporary abdominal closure. The main prognostic factors identified were ongoing peritonitis and hemodynamic instability, which characterize critically ill patients. These findings underscore the importance of prioritizing patient stability and controlling disease severity at the outset, before proceeding to definitive therapy once the patient is stable. Further high-quality, multicenter studies with larger sample sizes are needed to develop standardized treatment guidelines."

During emergency transport, his abdomen was flat, soft, and tender in the pericardial area, and blood biochemistry tests revealed a decreased hemoglobin of 10.2g/dL. He was admitted to our hospital, and conservative treatment was initiated. Five years ago, he underwent Hartmann procedure at another hospital for idiopathic perforation of the sigmoid colon. A month after discharge from the hospital, he had to undergo emergency surgery again at our hospital for colon resection and colostomy reconstruction due to colon perforation at the mouth side of the colostomy. He reported a history of colorectal perforation on the mouth side of the colostomy. After 6 months, a colostomy was performed and he was diagnosed with a terminal illness. Based on a family history of idiopathic colorectal perforation on his mother's side and the ruptured aneurysm, vascular-type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome was suspected. After admission, his symptoms of pericardial pain improved, but a CT scan on the 16th day revealed enlarged hepatic and splenic aneurysms. On July 24, he was transferred to a local hospital for splenic artery aneurysm treatment and underwent coiling the next day. His postoperative course was good, and he was transferred back to our hospital on July 26. He continued to show good progress and was discharged from the hospital on August 1. After discharge, he visited the outpatient genetic clinic for further examination. However, on October 9 of the same year, he developed aortic dissection and passed away."

We report the case of a 94-year-old Hispanic woman brought to the emergency department presenting with an acute abdomen. On physical examination, a tense, tender mass was seen in her left inguinal region, initially suspected as an incarcerated inguinal hernia. An abdominal computed tomography scan showed that this mass corresponded to a Nuck cyst. An encapsulated abscess adjacent to a jejunal segment and pneumoperitoneum were also seen, prompting an emergency surgical intervention. Intraoperative findings included a perforated diverticulum in the distal jejunum, as well as extensive diverticulosis involving the ileum and left colon. Resection and anastomosis were performed. Small bowel diverticulitis remains challenging to diagnose preoperatively, and more so in an elderly patient. This case report highlights the role of imaging in discerning among the differential diagnosis for acute abdomen in the elderly patients.

This retrospective case series, involving 8 patients undergoing emergency laparotomy, evaluated the feasibility of combining indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence and Doppler ultrasound for intraoperative bowel viability assessment. Indocyanine green was injected intravenously. Doppler assessment was performed using a high-frequency linear probe along the antimesenteric border. No patients required bowel resection. In 2 cases, initial ICG findings suggested non-viability, but Doppler ultrasound demonstrated preserved arterial flow. A second ICG injection showed fine granular fluorescence, allowing bowel preservation. The combination of modalities helped avoid unnecessary resections. Indocyanine green is safe and repeatable but limited by reduced signal in edematous tissue and subjectivity. Doppler ultrasound offers objective flow confirmation and may guide delayed reassessment. Despite a small sample size and selection bias, these findings support cautious, stepwise approaches in borderline cases and the need for multicenter prospective trials in emergency surgical settings."

    "title": "Claims filed after perceived malpractice in management of acute appendicitis: An observational nationwide cohort study.",
    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency worldwide. Obtaining a correct diagnosis and timely management can be challenging even in modern medicine. Hence, appendicitis is still considered a \"high-risk\" diagnosis for litigation and claims of malpractice. Few studies have investigated the pattern and outcome of claims for appendicitis in a contemporary universal health care system. The aim of this study is to analyze compensation claims related to the investigation and treatment of appendicitis in Norway. An observational study based on claims from the Norwegian System of Patient Injury Compensation (NPE) from 2005 to 2023. Population rates of appendicitis treatment were obtained from the Norwegian Patient Registry (NPR; data from 2016 to 2023) and Statistics Norway (SSB). Altogether 207 compensation claims were filed for appendicitis and 56 (27%) received compensation. The probability of receiving compensation was not influenced by age, gender, or geographical location. The most common reasons for compensation granted were delayed diagnosis (n = 25, 45%) and delayed treatment (n = 5, 9%). The most common reasons for the 151 (73%) denied claims were predictable complication (n = 48, 32%) and condition caused by an unrelated disease (n = 40, 26%). Out of the 59,450 appendectomies performed, 96 claims were filed to NPE, giving a claim rate of 0.16% or 1 claim for every 620 appendectomies. For the entire study period, there was a total payout of 27.2 mill NOK (approximately 2.4 mill EUR) with a mean of 460,000 NOK (approximately 40,000 EUR) and a median of 75,000 NOK (approximately 6,600 EUR) per claim. In acute appendicitis, about a quarter of claims are compensated due to malpractice. More than half of the approved claims involved delays in diagnosis or treatment, which can be related to the clinical challenges of diagnosing appendicitis."

    "title": "Impact of Initial Healthcare Setting and Family Caregiving Structure on Pediatric Appendicitis Outcomes in Resource-Limited Settings: A 10-Year Retrospective Cohort Study With External Validation.",
    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common pediatric surgical emergency worldwide. Misdiagnosis and perforation remain frequent, particularly among younger children in low- and middle-income countries. Prior studies have explored healthcare access or caregiving structures separately, but few long-term, large-sample retrospective studies in resource-limited settings have assessed their combined impact. We retrospectively analyzed 1839 children (0-14 years) undergoing appendectomy at a tertiary hospital in southwestern China (2008-2017). Exposures included initial healthcare facility level (tertiary vs non-tertiary) and caregiving structure (biparental, single-parent, non-parental). Multivariable logistic regression evaluated predictors of misdiagnosis and perforation, adjusting for age, sex, year, and imaging. Phi coefficient assessed correlation between misdiagnosis and perforation. All key findings were validated in an independent external 2018cohort. Nomograms were subsequently constructed based on significant predictors identified in the primary cohort. Initial presentation to non-tertiary facilities was associated with higher odds of misdiagnosis (aOR 2.39, 95 % CI 1.89-3.02) and perforation (aOR 2.97, 95 % CI 2.38-3.72). Non-biparental caregiving increased the risk of diagnostic error and complications: single-parent caregiving (misdiagnosis: aOR 2.57; perforation: aOR 2.54), non-parental caregiving (misdiagnosis: aOR 5.26; perforation: aOR 2.94). A significant interaction between non-parental caregiving and non-tertiary healthcare increased risks of misdiagnosis (OR 7.52) and perforation (OR 8.19). Younger age, particularly 0-3 years, was the strongest predictor. Additionally, lack of imaging was independently associated with increased risk of both misdiagnosis (aOR 1.78, 95 % CI 1.34-2.36) and perforation (aOR 2.06, 95 % CI 1.50-2.83). Misdiagnosis and perforation were moderately correlated (ϕ = 0.352). These findings were statistically significant and validated in an external cohort. Younger age, no imaging, non-traditional caregiving, and lower-level initial healthcare independently and interactively contribute to misdiagnosis and perforation in pediatric appendicitis."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Gastrointestinal mucormycosis is an underrecognized and underreported fungal infection with a high mortality rate. Diagnosis is often confounded by a non-specific constellation of signs and symptoms. We present a case of neutropenic colitis and ileocecal perforation secondary to gastrointestinal mucormycosis. CASE REPORT The patient was a 19-year-old man recently diagnosed with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, on active chemotherapy. He presented with abdominal pain and tenderness, and a contrast-enhanced CT revealed neutropenic colitis. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, his condition worsened, prompting reassessment. Follow-up CT showed bowel ischemia and a pelvic collection. He underwent an emergency laparotomy, which revealed destruction of the anterior cecal wall and detachment from the terminal ileum and ascending colon. Ileocecal resection was performed and histopathologic examination demonstrated angioinvasive fungal elements consistent with Mucor spp. He was diagnosed with gastrointestinal mucormycosis and promptly started on amphotericin intravenously. He improved over the next 2 weeks and was discharged with a plan to continue his 6-week course as an outpatient, followed by oral posaconazole maintenance therapy. Several weeks later, his infection relapsed secondary to non-compliance. He underwent repeat surgical debridement and antimicrobial therapy was restarted with intravenous amphotericin and Isavuconazole. He successfully completed 6 weeks of treatment and was transitioned to oral Isavuconazole prophylaxis. He remained stable and relapse-free at 6 months following his second procedure. CONCLUSIONS The case highlights the importance of early recognition of patients at risk for this infection, maintaining a high index of suspicion, and employing aggressive medical and surgical management strategies to avoid mortality."

    "abstract": "Non-traumatic abdominal emergencies (NTAEs) represent a diverse group of acute abdominal conditions that arise spontaneously and require prompt evaluation and management. These include common presentations such as acute appendicitis, ureteric colic, and pancreatitis. With the rising prevalence of non-communicable diseases like diabetes and hypertension, the clinical profile and complexity of these emergencies are increasing. To analyze the clinical spectrum, diagnostic patterns, management strategies, and outcomes of non-traumatic abdominal emergencies in a tertiary care setting. This prospective observational study was conducted over 18 months in a tertiary care hospital and included 103 adult patients diagnosed with NTAEs. Data on demographics, comorbidities, diagnosis, time of presentation, mode of treatment, and hospital stay were analyzed. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Among the 103 patients, 64 (62.1%) were males and 39 (37.9%) females. A total of 88 patients (85.4%) presented within 72 hours of symptom onset. The most common diagnoses were ureteric colic (n = 20, 19.4%), acute appendicitis (n = 15, 14.6%), and acute pancreatitis (n = 10, 9.7%). Conservative management was sufficient in 76 patients (73.8%), while 27 patients (26.2%) underwent surgical intervention. Comorbidities included diabetes mellitus in 31 patients (30.1%), hypertension in 29 (28.2%), and obesity in 33 (32.0%). Surgical intervention was significantly associated with male gender (p = 0.03) and older age (p = 0.01). Surgical patients had a longer mean hospital stay (6.07 ± 1.4 days) compared to non-surgical patients (5.8 ± 1.2 days), which was statistically significant (p = 0.004, t = 2.96). Imaging modalities such as ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy and influenced treatment decisions in over 90% of cases. Early recognition and timely imaging are pivotal in the management of NTAEs. Individualized treatment based on imaging and clinical findings is essential. Conservative management remains appropriate for most cases; however, prompt surgical referral should be considered for patients who are older, male, or have severe pathology, as these are significantly associated with the need for surgical intervention. Strengthening diagnostic pathways and enhancing early triage protocols may further improve outcomes in tertiary care settings."

    "abstract": "The safety and effectiveness of laparoscopic approaches for emergency colorectal surgery are not yet fully established, though their use is increasing with studies reporting laparoscopic colectomy is safe and feasible for appropriately selected patients. Hand-assisted laparoscopy (HAL) involves inserting one hand into the abdomen through a small incision, offering advantages that may facilitate laparoscopic procedures in emergencies. This study reports our experience with emergency HAL colectomy. This was a retrospective review of consecutive colorectal emergency cases treated with HAL colectomy in a tertiary referral center. Patient demographics, indications for surgery, operative details, and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. Survival rates were calculated for cases with malignancy. From February 2015 to July 2019, HAL was applied to all emergency colectomy cases in patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score of I-III. A total of 50 patients treated with HAL colectomy for complicated colorectal disease were reviewed. Twenty-five patients (50%) had an obstruction which required an intraoperative decompression procedure or intraoperative antegrade colonic irrigation. Thirty-eight patients (76%) had perforation. There were 2 cases of open conversion (4%). The median duration of the operation was 160 minutes. The median amount of estimated blood loss was 250 mL. The median time of postoperative stay was 12 days. The postoperative complication rate associated with the operation was 26% (13/50). There were 2 postoperative mortalities. HAL appears to be a feasible option in emergency colectomy for ASA I-III patients and may be beneficial in specific surgical practice contexts."

    "abstract": "Although prior studies have estimated the burden of pediatric surgical disease in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) through statistical modeling and hospital- or household-based surveys, few large-scale descriptions of procedures and outcomes have been published. We aimed to describe the epidemiology and outcomes of children's surgical care at multiple centers across Africa. Perioperative clinical data were collected prospectively from 2018 to 2023 at 17 hospitals in 11 African countries using a preexisting tool. Data came from children (age < 18 years) who underwent a surgical procedure in facilities equipped by the NGO Kids Operating Room. Data were stored on REDCap and descriptively analyzed. 16,454 procedures were performed, with a higher frequency of procedures performed in younger children than in older children (mean age 4.5 years). Congenital malformations, acquired genitourinary conditions, and acquired gastrointestinal conditions made up the most common diagnoses. We found a mortality rate of 3.7%, with higher mortality in neonates compared to younger children; conditions associated with the greatest mortality included congenital conditions, intestinal perforation, burns, and intussusception. Emergent operations were associated with much higher rates of mortality than elective operations. For the first time at this scale, we have assessed the epidemiology and outcomes of pediatric surgical care in LMICs. Findings were consistent with studies on the burden of disease, with a larger proportion of younger children accessing surgery, comparable mortality to other African studies, and higher mortality than in HICs. Future research and multilevel advocacy are needed to identify gaps in care and to design more effective interventions to reduce global disparities in access to surgical care for children."

    "abstract": "Foreign body ingestion is a significant clinical concern, particularly among elderly and psychiatric patients, often leading to complications such as intestinal obstruction. In this article, we present an intriguing case of dual intestinal and urinary obstruction caused by the ingestion of a dental bridge in a patient with Bricker urinary diversion. Through this rare case, we aim to explore the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges associated with such incidents, supported by a comprehensive review of the literature. A 52-year-old edentulous male with a history of bipolar disorder and a cystoprostatectomy with Bricker-type urinary diversion presented to the emergency department with a one-week history of subumbilical abdominal pain, vomiting, abdominal bloating and anuria. Physical examination revealed fever (38.5 °C), abdominal distension, localized guarding in the right iliac fossa, and a non-functional urostomy. Laboratory investigations demonstrated significant inflammatory markers accompanied by acute renal insufficiency. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging identified a mechanical small bowel obstruction caused by impacted dense fecal material, with proximal bowel dilation leading to extrinsic compression of the Bricker conduit, which showed wall thickening. Following brief resuscitation, the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy. During the procedure, marked small bowel distension was observed (upstream of an intraluminal obstructive material) that was exerting extrinsic compression on the Bricker diversion loop. Catheterization of the Bricker loop decompressed the urinary system, while enterotomy allowed removal of a dental bridge. The postoperative recovery was uneventful. The ingestion of dental prostheses carries life-threatening risks (obstruction, perforation), particularly in elderly patients or those with surgical histories (e.g., Bricker diversion). CT scanning is the gold standard for diagnosis. Management may range from simple observation to endoscopic extraction (which proves challenging in cases of small bowel impaction) or emergency surgery when severe complications are present. Multidisciplinary prevention strategies (including prosthesis checks and radiopaque markers) are crucial for at-risk populations. The ingestion of foreign bodies, such as dentures, poses a significant risk of intestinal obstruction or perforation. Prompt diagnosis and immediate intervention are critical to ensuring favorable outcomes, particularly in vulnerable patient populations."

    "abstract": "This study aims to assess the diagnostic value and problem-solving utility of follow-up abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) scans performed within 10 days of the initial presentation for acute non-traumatic abdominal symptoms in the emergency department. A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients who presented with acute abdominal symptoms to the emergency department between January 1, 2013 and May 30, 2023, and underwent abdominopelvic CT scans in the acute setting. Among this cohort, 149 patients had repeat abdominopelvic CT scans during the same admission and were classified into five groups based on findings: Group A (no change in diagnosis), Group B (confirmation of suspected initial diagnosis), Group C (disease progression), Group D (disease regression), and Group E (new diagnosis). The mean age of the cohort was 51.5+-18 years (range: 19-92). The average interval between initial and repeat CT scans was 40.9+-59.05 hours (range: 0.5-238). The number of patients in each group was as follows: Group A (n=21), Group B (n=60), Group C (n=32), Group D (n=25), and Group E (n=11). Partial bowel obstruction was the most common finding (27%, 41/149), with 72% (18/25) of Group D showing regression on follow-up CT. The \"wait and follow-up\" approach significantly guided management decisions for partial bowel obstruction (p<0.01). This study emphasizes the importance of the \"wait and repeat CT\" strategy in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and guiding clinical management for patients with acute non-traumatic abdominal complaints. Follow-up CT scans were particularly effective in identifying conditions such as partial bowel obstruction."

The study included demographic characteristics, symptoms, comorbidities, etiology, laboratory and abdominal CT results, treatment, and outcomes. The male-to-female ratio was 2.6:1, with a median age of 62 years. Common symptoms included abdominal pain (88%), vomiting (44%), and septic shock (36%). Comorbidities included coronary heart disease (52%), type 2 diabetes (64%), and hypertension (76%). Leukocytosis was observed in 84% of patients. Abdominal CT scans revealed HPVG in all patients. Etiologies included intestinal ischemia/necrosis (56%), intestinal obstruction (24%), suspected intestinal perforation (12%), and intestinal inflammation (8%). Treatment involved emergency surgery combined with antibiotic therapy in 72% of patients and conservative management in 28%. Outcomes showed 60% effectiveness and 40% mortality. Among the surgical group, 12 patients recovered and 6 died; among the conservative group, 3 recovered and 4 died. HPVG has complex etiologies, and abdominal CT is the recommended diagnostic method. Patients with acute abdomen should undergo surgery as soon as possible to improve prognosis, although some cases have poor prognosis."

    "abstract": "Background Accidental ingestion of coin-shaped lithium batteries (CSLBs) poses a serious health risk, leading to severe esophageal injuries and fatal complications. Conventional CSLBs cause rapid tissue damage due to electrochemical reactions, necessitating the development of safer battery designs. This study aimed to develop and evaluate an improved CSLB with a titanium-clad design to reduce electrochemical reactions and delay esophageal tissue damage in cases of accidental ingestion. Methods This study aimed to develop an improved CSLB using a three-layer clad structure (nickel-titanium-stainless steel) to reduce electrochemical reactions and delay tissue damage. A saline soak test was conducted to simulate battery ingestion and measure electrochemical activity. Additionally, an in vivo piglet experiment was used to assess the extent of esophageal tissue damage over time, comparing the improved battery with conventional CSLBs. Results The improved battery exhibited a significantly reduced electrochemical reaction, with a one-third lower consumed capacity in the saline soak test compared with conventional CSLBs. In vivo experiments demonstrated that full-thickness esophageal damage was delayed by four to six times, extending the time window for medical intervention from 2 h to 12 h. No perforation of the positive pole casing was observed in the improved battery compared with conventional CSLBs, indicating a safer design. Conclusion The novel titanium-clad CSLB successfully mitigates esophageal damage, providing critical additional time for emergency intervention. Although the improved design does not completely prevent injury, it significantly reduces the risk of fatal complications. These findings support the adoption of safer battery designs and the use of standardized test methods for future battery safety evaluations."

    "abstract": "Hemorrhagic cholecystitis (HC) is a rare but life-threatening condition. While anticoagulant therapy is a known risk factor, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has recently emerged as another trigger. We experienced a severe case of perforated HC complicated by hemoperitoneum in a patient presenting both risk factors. An 87-year-old male patient on apixaban therapy was admitted to a referral hospital seven days before COVID-19, where treatment with antiviral medication and steroids was initiated. Five days before transfer, the patient developed abdominal pain with elevated levels of inflammatory markers. On the day of presentation, the patient experienced sudden right upper abdominal pain and was transferred to our hospital following plain computed tomography (CT), which revealed gallbladder enlargement and suspected hemoperitoneum. Upon arrival, the patient exhibited diffuse abdominal tenderness. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed extravasation from the cystic artery and hematomas around the gallbladder, confirming the diagnosis of HC with hemoperitoneum. Emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed after administration of recombinant Factor Xa (used to reverse anticoagulation). Intraoperatively, hemorrhagic ascites were observed, with the gallbladder appearing tense, gangrenous, and perforated. A histopathological examination confirmed acute cholecystitis with necrosis and perforation. The postoperative course was uneventful, and apixaban therapy was restarted on postoperative day 1. The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility on postoperative day 13. Emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy was lifesaving in this patient with HC and hemoperitoneum."

Analysis reveals robotic procedures averaged 152 min (± 38) in duration, with an overall conversion rate of 9.1%. Complication rates showed no significant difference from laparoscopic methods (13.2% versus 14.7%, p = 0.21). The data highlight two significant robotic advantages: improved intraoperative hemostasis (85 mL versus 120 mL average blood loss, p = 0.03) and lower conversion rates among obese patients (11.3% versus 18.6%, p = 0.04). These findings indicate that robotic systems may provide distinct technical benefits for specific emergency scenarios while delivering safety outcomes equivalent to traditional minimally invasive surgery."

    "abstract": "To investigate the prevalence of mesenteric artery stenosis and its association with acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) among elderly patients presenting to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain. This single-center retrospective cohort study included 500 consecutive patients aged ≥65 years who underwent contrast-enhanced computed tomography in the emergency department owing to acute abdominal pain between 2013 and 2014. Imaging data were retrospectively evaluated by a consultant interventional radiologist for 50% or greater stenosis of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), celiac artery (CA), and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). The main outcomes of interest were the prevalence of atherosclerotic mesenteric artery stenosis in patients with acute abdominal pain, the prevalence of AMI in patients with mesenteric artery stenosis, and later presentation of mesenteric ischemia until the end of the follow-up, August 2025. Altogether, 123 patients (25%) had a mesenteric artery stenosis. Fifty-nine patients (12%) had ≥50% stenosis of the SMA, of whom 28 (5.6%) had 50% to 69% SMA stenosis and 31 (6.2%) had ≥70% SMA stenosis or total occlusion. In patients with SMA stenosis, a concomitant CA stenosis was recorded in 22 patients (37%) and 11 (19%) had a three-vessel disease involving the SMA, CA, and IMA. Forty patients (8.0%) had multivessel stenosis (SMA + CA, SMA + IMA, CA + IMA or SMA + CA + IMA). The prevalence of SMA stenosis increased with age; it was observed in 22 (6.9%) patients aged 65 to 79 years and in 37 (20%) patients aged ≥80 years. There were 14 patients (2.8%) with isolated 50% to 69% stenosis of the SMA of whom none had AMI at presentation; 9 patients (1.8%) had isolated ≥70% SMA stenosis of whom 2 (22%) presented with AMI. Of all patients with ≥70% SMA stenosis, 12 of 31 (39%) presented with AMI, and 12 of 40 (30%) with any multivessel stenosis presented with AMI. One of the patients with incidental mesenteric artery stenosis (ie, no AMI at presentation) developed symptomatic mesenteric ischemia during follow-up. Mesenteric artery stenosis is a relatively common clinical problem in elderly patients with acute abdomen. The risk of AMI is significant in emergency room patients with ≥70% SMA stenosis and involvement of other mesenteric arteries (multivessel disease). Occurrence of later symptoms seems to be rare in patients with incidental asymptomatic mesenteric artery stenosis."

When complicated by bowel obstruction, these hernias require urgent surgical intervention, which can lead to increased perioperative risks and prolonged recovery. This study aims to evaluate and compare the clinical outcomes and quality of life between open and laparoscopic surgery for incisional hernias complicated by bowel obstruction. Methods: AA 6-year prospective cohort study was conducted between January 2019 and 2024. A total of 117 patients who presented with incisional hernias complicated by bowel obstruction were included. Patients were divided into two groups: open surgery (n=91) and laparoscopic surgery (n=26). Pain and quality of life were assessed using the Visual Analog Scale and the questionnaire of the European Hernia Society. Results: Complication rates were significantly lower in the laparoscopic group (23.1% vs. 38.5%), although no significant differences were found in Clavien-Dindo complication grades. Patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery reported significantly lower postoperative pain scores on day 1 and discharge, and they showed superior quality of life scores, especially regarding pain during physical activity and cosmetic concerns, as measured by the EuraHS-QoL questionnaire. Conclusions: Laparoscopic surgery for incisional hernias complicated by bowel obstruction results in fewer complications, reduced postoperative pain, and improved quality of life compared to open surgery."

    "abstract": "To evaluate the proportion of emergency departments (EDs) with sufficient volumes to measure pediatric misdiagnosis reliably. We conducted a cross-sectional study of a nationally representative 20% sample of US EDs within the 2022 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample. We counted the number of child visits (less than 18 years old) at each ED for each of 24 serious pediatric emergency conditions and each ED's total across all conditions. We calculated the proportion of EDs that could reliably measure misdiagnosis rates at least 10% worse than condition-specific national reference standards. We also calculated the proportion of children visiting measurable EDs. Reliable misdiagnosis measurement across all serious conditions was possible in 614 out of 4,515 EDs (13.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 11.5 to 15.9). Appendicitis was the most reliably measurable condition (n=530 EDs, 11.7%, 95% CI 9.8 to 14.0), whereas complicated pneumonia (n=33, 0.7%, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.5), testicular torsion (n=29, 0.6%, 95% CI 0.2-1.4), and intussusception (n=25, 0.6%, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.2) were less frequently measurable. The 20 other included conditions were not reliably measurable in any ED (0.0%, 95% CI 0.0 to 0.4). Midwest, nonmetropolitan, and EDs evaluating less than 1,800 children per year were least likely to be able to support reliable measurement. Among 185,490 children with a serious condition, 130,894 (70.6%) visited an ED in which misdiagnosis was measurable. Few EDs have sufficient pediatric volumes to reliably measure diagnostic accuracy generally, and even fewer can do so for individual conditions. Aggregation of EDs could improve power to measure misdiagnosis."

    "abstract": "Ascariasis, caused by Ascaris lumbricoides, is the most common helminthic infection worldwide, mainly in developing countries. Although intestinal obstruction is its most frequent complication, intestinal perforation with peritonitis is rare and life-threatening. A 45-year-old woman from a rural area presented with cramping abdominal pain, intermittent fever, and asthenia for 3 months. Emergency laparotomy revealed generalized peritonitis due to ileal perforation, managed with ileal resection and ileostomy. Postoperative complications included respiratory failure, septic shock, and three reoperations for eventration, adhesive syndrome, and hemorrhage. On postoperative Day 33, a 20 cm A. lumbricoides worm was expelled through the ileostomy. Intestinal perforation likely resulted from pressure-induced ischemia by a worm mass. Diagnosis can be delayed due to nonspecific symptoms and absent eosinophilia. Ascariasis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of intestinal perforation in endemic areas. Early surgical intervention, clinical suspicion, and preventive measures are key to improving outcomes."

We report the experience of the paediatric nephrology unit in Dakar, Senegal, initiating PD for children with acute kidney injury (AKI), using a haemodialysis catheter inserted via a modified Seldinger technique. This approach was chosen due to its availability and cost-free provision, addressing resource constraints effectively. This pilot case series study describes a cohort of nine children with AKI managed using this innovative technique between March and October 2024 in Dakar, Senegal. Nine children, including two neonates with life-threatening AKI, were included. Mean age was 4.5 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.25. Infections accounted for 44.4% (n = 4) of the cases. Catheter insertion in the peritoneal cavity was successful in eight out of nine cases; one mispositioned catheter (case 9) was removed and excluded from analysis. During the first week, no cases of bleeding or dialysate leakage occurred at the insertion site. Peritonitis was observed in two cases after > 2 weeks. Of the eight children with successful catheter placement, five stabilised on PD (62.5%); and of those five, two (40%) fully recovered kidney function. Three children (37.5%) succumbed to septic shock from the underlying infection. Within the \"Saving Young Lives\" programme, our small case series showed that a haemodialysis catheter can feasibly deliver paediatric emergency PD in Dakar. Safety, efficacy, and programme-level impact must be confirmed in larger, multi-centre studies before wider training and implementation."

Although clinical symptoms and biomarkers are essential for diagnosis, imaging methods, particularly computed tomography (CT), are critical due to the inability to perform endoscopic procedures in the acute phase because of the risk of perforation. Various classification systems that include imaging findings have been developed. The most recent and widely accepted system is the Sartelli classification, which is endorsed by the World Society of Emergency Surgery. This classification describes stages of diverticulitis ranging from edematous bowel wall thickening and phlegmon in the adjacent mesentery to microperforation, localized or distant abscess formation, and generalized peritonitis with free fluid and air. Imaging findings are also pivotal in diagnosing and managing complications such as abscesses, pylephlebitis, fistulas, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Moreover, imaging can differentiate diverticulitis from infectious colitis, epiploic appendagitis, ischemic colitis, colorectal carcinoma, and inflammatory bowel disease. This review focuses on the radiological findings of diverticulitis. We specifically discuss CT imaging and emphasize its clinical manifestations, significant complications, and differential diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Primary signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) of the appendix is an exceedingly rare malignancy with a non-specific clinical manifestations, and it often masquerades as acute appendicitis. Case presentation A 76-year-old man presented with acute abdominal pain and peritonitis. Abdominal computed tomography revealed relative acute appendicitis with peritonitis, and emergency laparoscopic partial cecectomy with appendectomy revealed gangrenous appendicitis with perforation. A histopathological examination revealed a primary appendiceal signet ring cell carcinoma (PASRCC). This case highlights the importance of considering appendiceal malignancies in the differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis. SRCC is a histological variant commonly associated with multiple malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract, particularly gastric and colorectal cancers. PASRCC is a rare malignancy presenting with symptoms indistinguishable from those of acute appendicitis. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for appendiceal malignancy, particularly in older patients with atypical clinical presentations. Early recognition, accurate diagnosis by histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations, and appropriate management are essential for optimizing the outcomes in these patients."

    "abstract": "Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract, typically asymptomatic but occasionally presenting with complications such as bleeding, obstruction, or rarely, perforation. Symptomatic MD is unusual in the elderly, often mimicking other acute abdominal conditions and posing diagnostic challenges, especially in low-resource settings. We report a case of a 64-year-old male presenting with a 2-day history of right iliac fossa pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. Clinical examination and laboratory findings were suggestive of perforated appendicitis. Due to the unavailability of CT imaging, an urgent exploratory laparotomy was performed, revealing a perforated MD located 40 cm from the ileocecal valve. A wedge resection was conducted. Histopathological examination confirmed ischemic necrosis and ectopic gastric mucosa. The patient recovered smoothly and was discharged on postoperative Day 5. Perforation of MD is rare, particularly in elderly patients, and often leads to diagnostic confusion with more common causes of acute abdomen. In the absence of reliable imaging modalities, clinical acumen and timely surgical exploration are crucial. The presence of ectopic gastric mucosa within MD increases the risk of perforation. Surgical resection, tailored to intraoperative findings, remains the definitive treatment. This case underscores the need to consider MD in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen, even in older adults. In resource-limited settings, prompt surgical intervention guided by clinical evaluation can be lifesaving and highlights the importance of maintaining a broad differential to avoid missed or delayed diagnoses."

Sigmoid volvulus, an unusual but potentially catastrophic cause of major bowel obstruction, is rarely associated with Situs inversus. A 76-year-old male presented with abdominal pain and obstipation for 5 days. Clinical examination and imaging revealed signs of bowel obstruction and dextrocardia. Computed tomography (CT) scan abdomen confirmed sigmoid volvulus and situs inversus totalis. Emergency laparotomy revealed a 360-degree twisted, dilated sigmoid colon. Manual detorsion and excision of fibrous bands were performed. The patient recovered uneventfully. While sigmoid volvulus is a known surgical emergency, its diagnosis in situs inversus patients can be challenging due to reversed anatomical landmarks. Imaging plays a critical role in both diagnosis and surgical planning. Awareness of reversed anatomy in situs inversus is crucial for prompt diagnosis and successful surgical management acute abdominal conditions like volvulus."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous esophageal perforation, especially Boerhaave syndrome, carries high morbidity and mortality. Minimally invasive treatments like esophageal stenting and endoscopic vacuum therapy (EVT) are increasingly used, but optimal management remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the efficacy and safety of esophageal stenting and EVT in managing esophageal defects by assessing sealing rates, failure rates, and mortality. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library through 24 March 2025. Only observational studies and case series were included. Primary outcomes were the pooled sealing rate, failure rate, and mortality for stenting, and the closure rate for EVT. Data were analyzed using a random-effects model, with heterogeneity assessed by the I 2 statistic. Twenty stenting studies (245 patients) showed a pooled sealing rate of 86.1% (95% CI: 80.2-92.0%) and a failure rate of 14.9% (95% CI: 8.5-21.3%). Stent-related mortality was 7.4% (95% CI: 3.5-11.4%). Thirteen EVT studies (424 patients) demonstrated a pooled sealing rate of 54.1% (95% CI: 34.8-73.4%) with high heterogeneity (I 2 = 98.24%). After sensitivity analysis, the EVT sealing rate rose to 89.6% (95% CI: 83.9-95.3%). Both esophageal stenting (86.1% success) and EVT (54.1% overall; 89.6% post-sensitivity) effectively close esophageal defects. However, EVT's heterogeneity and the observational design of studies limit definitive conclusions. These findings affirm stenting's role and suggest EVT's promise, yet emphasize the urgent need for randomized controlled trials to establish evidence-based guidelines."

    "abstract": "Simultaneous presentation of acute appendicitis and ovarian torsion is rare and requires urgent surgical intervention due to the high risk of complications, including sepsis and mortality. While adnexal torsion is a known cause of acute abdomen in reproductive-age women, co-presentation with appendicitis is exceptionally uncommon. This case underlines the importance of considering gynecological differentials in women presenting with acute abdominal pain. A 39-year-old woman presented with right lower abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting. Initially diagnosed with an appendicular lump, she was managed conservatively and discharged after symptomatic improvement. Upon recurrence of symptoms, imaging revealed an ovarian dermoid cyst with torsion. Exploratory laparotomy identified a gangrenous ovary with a twisted cyst and adherent appendix. Histopathology confirmed acute appendicitis and a benign dermoid cyst. Adnexal torsion occurs when the ovary and fallopian tube twist around their ligaments, often caused by ovarian cysts like dermoid cysts. These cysts are common in young women and can lead to acute abdominal pain, requiring urgent surgery to prevent ovarian damage. Diagnosis is challenging, as symptoms mimic other conditions like appendicitis. Imaging such as ultrasonography or computed tomography is used, and treatment involves surgical untwisting or removal of affected tissues. Torsion sometimes affects nearby organs, like an appendix. This case highlights the rare occurrence of simultaneous appendicitis and ovarian torsion, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis and surgical intervention."

    "abstract": "Acute cholecystitis (AC) is a condition that requires surgical treatment. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is considered the gold standard. Based on routine blood tests, it is possible to determine the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), which accurately characterizes the body's systemic inflammatory response. The NLR is used as a prognostic tool in many gastrointestinal diseases and may therefore be useful in the diagnosis of AC. The objective of this study is to assess the prognostic value of the NLR index in the course of AC. This is a retrospective analysis of patients with AC who underwent LC. The study analyzed the following factors: emergency or elective admission, white blood cell count and bilirubin levels which are the part of preoperative laboratory tests, intraoperative complications such as gallbladder perforation and empyema formation, surgery duration, and length of hospital stay. The study involved 306 patients treated with LC. In the group of patients with NLR >5, there was a statistically significant correlation with higher risk of emergency admission, elevated bilirubin levels, higher risk of empyema, longer surgery time and hospital stay. We did not find an association between the NLR index and the risk of gallbladder perforation or patient gender. High NLR values are associated with an increased risk of complications during AC. Therefore, this predictor can be successfully used in clinical practice to identify the severe course of cholecystitis."

With fewer than 200 reported cases, PL remains underrecognized; this case underscores its potential to mimic common gastrointestinal/urinary disorders, advocating for heightened clinical suspicion. A 42-year-old male presented with a 2-day history of colicky abdominal pain under the xiphoid process, ac companied by nausea, vomiting, and watery stools. Initial external hospital evaluations suggested small bowel obstruction and mesenteric lymphadenitis. Past medical history included abnormal blood glucose levels. Physical examination revealed right upper abdominal tenderness and mild distension. Imaging studies were pivotal. Emergency abdominal-pelvic computed tomography showed diffuse low-density fat accumulation compressing the bladder and rectum (\"pelvic lucency sign\"), thickened bladder walls, and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging confirmed symmetrical pelvic fat deposition with bladder deformation and elevated bladder base. Laboratory tests revealed mildly elevated bilirubin, C-reactive protein, and triglycerides, but no significant urinary or metabolic abnormalities. Final diagnosis confirmed PL with concurrent prostatitis and pelvic inflammatory changes. The patient received conservative management, including acid suppression, gastric protection, nutritional support, and symptomatic relief. Surgical intervention was deferred due to symptom improvement. Post-discharge recommendations included dietary control, weight management, and regular follow-up for monitoring disease progression. Clinical resolution: symptoms resolved with conservative management including acid suppression and nutritional support, with the patient discharged in stable condition. Imaging correlation: magnetic resonance imaging confirmed symmetrical pelvic fat deposition with bladder deformation, while computed tomography demonstrated the characteristic \"pelvic lucency sign.\" Long-term planning: regular monitoring was instituted for potential urinary obstruction and malignancy risk given established associations with chronic cystitis. PL poses diagnostic challenges due to nonspecific symptoms and often mimics gastrointestinal or urinary disorders. Imaging remains critical for accurate diagnosis. While conservative management suffices in mild cases, surgical options should be considered for severe organ compression. This case underscores the importance of early recognition, multidisciplinary evaluation, and tailored management to mitigate long-term morbidity."

Therapeutic drug level monitoring helps optimize the use of vancomycin in CKD patients. We studied whether sufficient serum levels were achieved in patients with PD-related peritonitis treated with the commonly used dose of vancomycin in patients with end stage renal disease. All consecutive patients with PD-related peritonitis during 19 months were studied. Patients received IP Vancomycin 15 mg/kg Q96H and amikacin 2 mg/kg while awaiting culture reports. Vancomycin concentration in serum and dialysate was determined by a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay at 1, 12, 24, and 96 h. The primary outcome was the drug levels in serum and peritoneal fluid, and the secondary outcome was peritonitis treatment failure. A total of 45 episodes of PD-related peritonitis were treated, of which 41 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the PK analysis. Recommended serum vancomycin trough level of >15 mg/L was achieved in only two cases. Twenty-one episodes required catheter removal. In patients with PD-related peritonitis, intermittent intraperitoneal administration of 15 mg/kg of vancomycin every 96 h does not achieve the recommended serum and dialysate levels of vancomycin. There is an urgent need for pharmacokinetic studies on commonly used IP antibiotics in the PD population to facilitate correct dose recommendations."

    "abstract": "Open abdomen management (OAM) is now used for non-traumatic conditions like gastrointestinal ischemia. The optimal sedation strategy for patients undergoing OAM is unclear, especially for light sedation. We evaluate the feasibility of targeted lighter sedation in patients undergoing OAM. We retrospectively studied non-trauma patients undergoing OAM in the ICU. A lighter sedation was implemented for a cohort of patients than the conventional sedation target in an earlier cohort. In our strategy, we set a goal of sedation depth of 0 to -2 on the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) for patients without abdominal compartment syndrome, active bleeding, or requiring continuous muscle relaxants. Primary outcomes were whether or not each patient experienced light sedation (RASS -2 to 0) at least once during OAM and propofol dosage during OAM, calculated as milligrams per kilogram of body weight per hour (mg/kg/h). Thirty-two patients were included in each cohort. The primary indications for OAM were gastrointestinal ischemia and gastrointestinal perforation. Before implementation of the strategy, 13 patients (41%) had lighter sedation at least once during OAM, compared with 27 (84%) after implementation. The mean propofol dosage during OAM was 1.30 ± 0.94 before and 1.07 ± 0.68 after (adjusted mean difference -0.27 mg/kg/h; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.71 to 0.17). After abdominal closure, patients with lighter sedation could be weaned from ventilation faster than those with deeper sedation (P=0.015) and were also discharged from the ICU earlier (P=0.013). There were no adverse events requiring emergent abdominal exploration during OAM. A targeted light sedation strategy for non-trauma patients undergoing OAM was suggested to be feasible, safe, and associated with earlier liberation from mechanical ventilation and ICU, suggesting potential clinical benefits. These findings should be confirmed in future prospective, multicenter studies."

Among them, transmesocolic hernias are particularly uncommon and pose a diagnostic challenge due to their non-specific clinical and radiological features. We report the case of a 68-year-old female with known metastatic invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast, who presented with right flank pain, nausea, and constipation. Imaging suggested small bowel obstruction without a clear etiology. Emergency laparotomy revealed a transmesocolic hernia with two jejunal loops herniated through a 6 cm × 3 cm mesocolic defect. The herniated bowel was viable and reduced, and the defect was repaired. No bowel resection was necessary. Transmesocolic hernias may be congenital or acquired. In this case, the defect was likely secondary to peritoneal carcinomatosis or mass effect from metastatic disease. Diagnosis is often delayed due to non-specific signs. Early surgical intervention is essential to prevent bowel ischemia and infarction. Transmesocolic hernia, though rare, should be considered in patients with small bowel obstruction and no prior surgical history, especially in the setting of peritoneal malignancy. High clinical suspicion and timely operative management are critical for favorable outcomes."

    "abstract": "Fungal keratitis is a rare but severe complication following penetrating keratoplasty (PKP). We report the clinical course, rapid deterioration, and management of a case of Aspergillus flavus keratitis occurring three months after PKP. A 69-year-old woman with Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy developed pseudophakic bullous keratopathy following cataract surgery. She underwent an uneventful PKP. At two months postoperatively, the graft remained clear with a visual acuity of 2/10. Three months after keratoplasty, the patient presented with pain, redness, mucopurulent discharge, and decreased vision. Slit-lamp examination revealed graft haze with a central epithelial defect, stromal infiltrates, and striae that rapidly progressed into the adjacent recipient cornea. Corneal scrapings were obtained for direct microscopic examination and culture, which revealed septate fungal filaments identified as Aspergillus flavus. Both the donor corneoscleral rim and the recipient corneal tissue were cultured at the time of surgery, and all cultures returned negative for fungal growth. Considering the negative donor cultures, the delayed onset of infection, and the presence of a persistent epithelial defect, the infection was most consistent with a postoperative superinfection rather than a donor-transmitted source. Intensive topical voriconazole and amphotericin B, along with systemic voriconazole, were initiated. Antifungal susceptibility testing was not performed due to the urgent need to initiate empirical therapy following the identification of fungal filaments on direct microscopy and rapid clinical deterioration. Despite aggressive antifungal therapy, the infection progressed, leading to graft melting and corneal perforation. The patient underwent therapeutic PKP, open sky vitrectomy, and removal of the posterior chamber intraocular lens (PC-IOL). Following the removal of the PC-IOL intraoperatively, the patient remained aphakic. Postoperatively, there was no recurrence of infection, and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) stabilized at 6/10 with aphakic spectacle correction. This case highlights the virulence of Aspergillus flavus and the challenges in managing post-keratoplasty fungal keratitis, especially when predisposing factors such as persistent epithelial defect and corticosteroid use are present. Early diagnosis and prompt medical and surgical intervention are critical to preserving ocular integrity."

Preoperative diagnosis of ileo-ileal knotting is extremely challenging due to nonspecific clinical features, and most cases are identified only during emergency surgery. We present three cases of ileo-ileal knotting to illustrate varied precipitating factors, presentations, and diagnostic challenges associated with this condition. All patients underwent urgent exploratory laparotomy with resection of the knotted, nonviable bowel and primary anastomosis; each had an uneventful recovery and was discharged in good condition. Although rare, ileo-ileal knotting should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute intestinal obstruction, especially in rapidly deteriorating patients with signs of strangulation, since prompt surgical intervention is essential to prevent a fatal outcome."

However, distinguishing between uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis can be challenging. Clinical and imaging findings are often used, but their predictive value is still debatable. The objective of the study is to identify the predictive value of clinical and computed tomography (CT) scan findings for complicated appendicitis in patients who underwent appendectomy. A retrospective analysis of data from a cohort of patients who underwent appendectomy in a tertiary governmental hospital was conducted. The study population included patients from varied demographic backgrounds, excluding those who were immunocompromised or had an appendectomy for reasons other than appendicitis. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Out of 256 patients, 57.4% were male and the majority were of Saudi origin (74.6%). A significant difference in the distribution of Alvarado scores between groups with complicated (6, IQR: 5-7) and uncomplicated appendicitis (5, IQR: 4-6) was observed. The logistic regression analysis revealed symptom duration, Alvarado score, and the presence of cecal and ileum thickness in CT scan as significant predictors for complicated appendicitis. Symptom duration, Alvarado score, and the presence of cecal and ileum thickness in CT scan are significant predictors for complicated appendicitis. Healthcare professionals should consider these predictors when assessing patients with suspected appendicitis to facilitate early identification and management of potential complications. Further research is required to validate these predictors in different populations and settings."

We retrospectively reviewed all children (age < 18 years) who underwent an appendectomy for simple appendicitis at our institution (January 2015-December 2021). Patients were identified and patient demographics, clinicopathologic factors, and postoperative outcomes were abstracted from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Pediatric (NSQIP-P) institutional dataset. Supplemental patient-level data were obtained via the electronic medical record. Population-level variables, including SDI and ADI as well as other neighborhood characteristics were obtained after geocoding patient home addresses. Patient-level postoperative outcomes included length of stay, percutaneous drain insertion, peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) placement, emergency department (ED) visit within 30 days of discharge, as well as any postoperative fever, antibiotics, imaging, and parenteral nutrition usage. A multivariable model predictive of outcomes was created using feature selection and exploratory factor analysis. Factor analysis revealed two uncorrelated multivariable factors: factor 1 included SDI score and ADI score, and factor 2 included percentages of Black, Hispanic, high-needs, and linguistically isolated residents. Lower factor 1 scores were associated with increased length of stay and increased frequency of postoperative imaging, while low factor 2 scores were associated with increased postoperative antibiotic usage. Two latent factors were identified encompassing broad socioeconomic advantage (factor 1: SDI and ADI) and specific neighborhood characteristics (factor 2: the proportion of minoritized, high-needs, and linguistically isolated residents). Dividing the population using these factors demonstrated that patients with more socioeconomic advantage (low factor 1 scores) had increased lengths of stay and more postoperative imaging. Similarly, patients from neighborhoods with lower proportions of minoritized, high-needs, and linguistically isolated residents had less postoperative antibiotic usage. These results suggest that postoperative outcomes in children with appendicitis extend beyond socioeconomic status in a broad sense and are also impacted by specific neighborhood characteristics. The ability to isolate individual drivers of outcomes that are associated with SDoH may help to develop more tailored interventions aimed at attenuating disparities for vulnerable populations."

    "abstract": "Malignant colonic obstruction (MCO) occurs in 10–18% of colorectal cancers. Traditionally, emergency surgery has been the standard treatment modality. However, it is associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates compared to patients undergoing elective surgery. With the advancement of endoscopic techniques, the self-expandable metal stent has been advocated as an alternative management that provides relief of obstructive symptoms, allowing the patient’s general condition to be restored and enabling elective surgery. Furthermore, the ability to complete staging allowed identification and avoidance of unnecessary surgery in patients with advanced disease who need palliative measures. However, various stent-related complications have been reported in the literature, including perforation, migration, and obstruction. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the success and complication rates of stent placement in MCO and compare short-term outcomes to those of upfront surgical management. We conducted a retrospective cohort study that included all patients with MCO between March 2015 and September 2021. Patients who had colon perforation at the time of the diagnosis, benign colonic obstruction, tumors of the rectum, or peritoneal metastasis that underwent cytoreductive surgery were all excluded. Patients were divided into groups according to the initial treatment, stent versus surgery, and the intent of therapy, curative versus palliative. Data was collected from medical records. Among 112 patients, 24 had stenting as a bridge to surgery (SBTS), and 16 underwent palliative stenting. The technical success rate was 95%, with failure in two patients due to complete obstruction and perforation in one patient each. Two patients (5%) who underwent stenting had clinical failure with persistent symptomatic obstruction beyond 48 h. The early complication rate following stent insertion was 8%, primarily due to perforation, obstruction from fecal impaction, and stent kinking. SBTS did not affect the laparoscopic approach or stoma creation rate among curative patients. However, it was associated with a more extended hospital stay. Half the patients who received stenting in the palliative group required re-stenting due to re-obstruction, with a mean stent patency time of 7 months. Management of MCO varies based on the patient’s clinical presentation, tumor site, and surgeon’s preference. Stent placement, whether as a bridge to surgery or as a palliative measure, is a safe, less invasive, and effective management option with success and low complication rates."

    "abstract": "Acute bowel obstruction (ABO) is a common indication for emergency abdominal surgery, often performed on a severely dilated intestine with compromised barrier function. The recovery of bowel motility in this acute setting differs from elective surgery and remains insufficiently investigated. Yet, its understanding is crucial for improving perioperative care in surgical emergencies. This study aimed to identify risk factors for postoperative ileus (POI) after emergency surgery for ABO and to explore its impact on postoperative outcomes. We retrospectively analyzed 466 patients who underwent emergency surgery for ABO between 2014 and 2020, of whom 156 developed POI. POI was defined as the absence of postoperative bowel movement requiring intravenous prokinetic therapy following an insufficient response to initial conservative measures, including oral laxatives. Perioperative predictors for POI were identified by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. The association between POI and adverse postoperative outcomes was examined using correlation analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed male sex (p = 0.0009), chronic steroid therapy (p = 0.0064), high postoperative SOFA score (p = 0.0037), and elevated CRP levels on postoperative day two (p = 0.048) as independent predictors for POI. Patients with POI had significantly higher rates of postoperative respiratory (p < 0.0001) and surgical complications (p = 0.0014). Our findings suggest sex-dependent differences and an involvement of inflammatory processes in bowel function recovery following emergency surgery for ABO. POI in this setting is associated with increased risk of postoperative respiratory complications and surgical morbidity. These results highlight the need for targeted preventive strategies and form a solid foundation for future prospective studies aimed at optimizing perioperative care and reducing POI-related morbidity in surgical emergencies."

    "abstract": "Internal hernias (IHs) are uncommon, representing under 1 % of all cases, and are hard to diagnose early, often leading to discovery during surgery. A 30-year-old patient with no prior surgeries presented with sudden severe abdominal pain and vomiting. Examination showed generalized defence and hyperactive bowel sounds. Imaging suggested bowel obstruction. Emergency surgery revealed a large internal hernia through the right leaflet of an elongated sigmoid mesocolon containing the entire small bowel. The bowel was viable and reduced, followed by sigmoid resection and temporary colostomy. The patient recovered well with no major complications and was discharged on day eight. Internal abdominal hernias are a rare cause of small bowel obstruction (SBO), with transmesosigmoid hernias (TMSHs) being one of the less common subtypes. These hernias occur due to defects in the sigmoid mesocolon and can present with acute abdominal pain and signs of bowel obstruction. Although both congenital and acquired factors have been suggested, the exact cause remains unclear. Prompt diagnosis is crucial to avoid serious complications such as strangulation, gangrene, and perforation. Multidetector CT scans have greatly improved preoperative diagnosis by providing detailed images of internal structures. Surgical repair, either laparoscopic or open, is essential for treatment, with laparoscopy offering benefits in terms of recovery and complications. This report emphasizes the rarity of TMSHs and difficult to diagnose due to nonspecific symptoms. Moreover, highlights the value of early diagnosis and timely surgical intervention to prevent complications."

In this report, we present the case of a 19-year-old female who arrived to the emergency department with recurrent right lower quadrant pain, unresponsive to initial management for suspected acute appendicitis, and urinary tract infection. Advanced imaging revealed an appendiceal mucocele. The patient underwent appendectomy, and histopathology confirmed a well-differentiated appendiceal neuroendocrine tumor (grade 2) with lymphovascular invasion. A subsequent right hemicolectomy identified metastatic disease in 6 out of 27 lymph nodes. Unfortunately, the patient was lost to follow-up shortly after surgery. This case underscores the diagnostic complexities of appendiceal neuroendocrine tumors, which are often incidental findings during appendectomy and may present with nonspecific or atypical symptoms. It highlights the critical role of tumor size, grade, and histopathological evaluation in guiding management decisions, as well as the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to treatment.

This multi-lumen tube, featuring esophageal and gastric balloons, applied mechanical pressure to control bleeding and provided a temporary solution until more definitive treatments could be employed. It was historically significant in resource-limited settings where advanced endoscopic options were unavailable, enabling patient stabilization and transfer to specialized centers. However, the advent of GI endoscopy and its increased availability has rendered the SB tube obsolete. SB tubes are associated with complications, including esophageal perforation, aspiration pneumonia, and gastric ulceration. Additionally, the tube can cause significant discomfort, and its migration may lead to inadequate. Techniques such as endoscopic variceal ligation and endoscopic sclerotherapy offer superior precision, efficacy, and safety for managing variceal bleeding. Improved hospital transfer protocols now facilitate prompt endoscopic or surgical interventions, reducing the need for temporary measures like the SB tube. Additionally, advancements in pharmacological treatments, including vasoactive drugs, reliance on mechanical compression devices. While the SB tube remains an important historical artifact, its role in current medical practice reflecting safer and more effective treatment options in emergency GI care. This review discusses the declining role of the Sengstaken -Blakemore tube and its replacement by current intervention methods."

    "abstract": "Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) enables en-bloc resection of large (>2cm) colorectal lesions. Despite its proven benefits, ESD remains underutilized in many countries. We evaluated the quality and safety of colorectal ESD resections during the implementation of this technique in a Norwegian endoscopy centre. This single centre cohort study included all ESD-procedures performed from March 2021 until March 2025 in a Norwegian community hospital. All data were registered prospectively for quality and safety purposes. Main outcomes were en-bloc and complete (R0) resection rates as well as curative rate and complications. Additional outcomes were dissection time and speed. Outcomes were compared in three equal periods. In total, 131 procedures were performed, 105 (83%) were outpatient procedures and 123 (94%) were completed. En-bloc resection was achieved in 117 (95%), R0 resections in 98 (80%) and curative resections in 84 (68%). Complications occurred in 19 (15%) patients, intraprocedural in five (4%) and post-procedural in 14 (11%). All intraprocedural perforations (n = 3) were managed endoscopically. One patient (0,7%) had emergency surgery due to a suspicion of perforation (Clavien-Dindo score IIIb). Elective completion surgery was required in 15 patients (11%). Median dissection time was 135 min (interquartile range [IQR]: 100-195) in the first period and 80 min (IQR: 56-110) in the third period. Dissection speed (in mm2/min) increased from 13 (IQR: 10-20) in the first period, to 26 (IQR: 19-38) in the third period. Colorectal ESD can be safely and effectively implemented in the Nordic setting."

    "title": "A case of chronic abdominal pain related to the ingestion of raw seafood: Anisakiasis.",
    "abstract": "A previously healthy 40-year-old man presented to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain and repeated bilious vomiting that began the previous day and progressively worsened. On examination, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable, with mild diffuse abdominal tenderness and no peritoneal signs. Laboratory studies showed leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance, an elevated C-reactive protein, and no eosinophilia. Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography revealed segmental thickening of the small bowel wall with localized obstruction, without evidence of a mechanical cause such as adhesions, masses, or strangulation. A detailed dietary history disclosed that the patient had consumed raw flounder obtained directly from a fisherman three days earlier. Given the coastal endemic setting and high clinical suspicion, serologic testing for Anisakis-specific IgE was performed, yielding markedly elevated levels (>100 UA/mL), supporting the diagnosis of allergic-mediated intestinal Anisakiasis. The patient was treated conservatively in the ED observation unit with nasogastric decompression, bowel rest, and intravenous hydration. Over the next 48 h, symptoms resolved, vomiting ceased, and bowel function returned to normal. He was discharged on a cooked-seafood-only diet. At follow-up, he reported complete resolution of chronic intermittent abdominal discomfort that had been present for several years. Repeat IgE testing demonstrated a substantial decline, correlating with sustained symptom relief. This case underscores the importance for emergency physicians in endemic areas to consider allergic intestinal anisakiasis in patients presenting with unexplained small bowel obstruction, to obtain a thorough dietary history, and to utilize specific IgE testing to guide diagnosis and avoid unnecessary surgical intervention."

    "abstract": "UC is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can be severe enough lead to bowel perforation and even colorectal cancer. The current treatments for UC have several limitations, highlighting the urgent need for the development of novel therapeutic agents. Recent research has shown that ZNF70 plays a crucial role in colitis-associated colorectal cancer. PLD, as one of the main active ingredients of Platycodon grandiflorum, can attenuate DSS-induced intestinal inflammation. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mechanism by which PLD works to treat UC. Prediction of targets for PLD and colitis using network pharmacology. In vitro, overexpression of ZNF70/knockdown of ZNF70 plasmid was transfected into THP-1 cells and cells were induced with a combination of LPS and ATP. The effect of PLD on NLRP3 inflammasome and STAT3 signaling pathway was detected. In in vivo experiments, DSS induced acute colitis in mice, and ZNF70 lentivirus was injected into the tail vein to knock down ZNF70 to study the effect of PLD on colitis. A series of experimental methods such as WB, PCR, IP and IF were used in the study. Through a series of in vitro experiments, it was found that PLD downregulated the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome and STAT3 signaling pathway through ZNF70. In DSS-induced colitis in vivo experiments, knockdown of ZNF70/addition of PLD reduced the expression of inflammatory factors and attenuated the inflammatory response. HPLC analysis also showed no accumulation of PLD in the five organs. This work demonstrates for the first time that PLD targets ZNF70 to regulate the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and the STAT3 signaling pathway in macrophages, revealing an unknown property of PLD for the treatment of colitis and providing a new basis for targeting ZNF70 to improve the efficacy of treatment in colitis and other diseases."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic potential of salivary C-reactive protein (CRP) as a non-invasive biomarker for acute appendicitis in children and to compare its levels with those found in blood. Salivary and serum CRP levels were measured in patients with histologically confirmed acute appendicitis (n = 46) and a control group with non-specific abdominal pain (n = 43). Diagnostic performance was evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic analysis, while the agreement between salivary and serum CRP levels was evaluated using Spearman's correlation and the Bland-Altman method. Salivary CRP levels were significantly elevated in children with acute appendicitis than in controls (median 35.7 vs. 1.1 mg/L, p < 0.001), closely mirroring serum CRP trends (median 44.3 mg/L vs. 1.1 mg/L, p < 0.001). Moreover, they demonstrated excellent discriminatory power (Area Under the Curve; AUC = 0.97; 91.3% sensitivity, 95.4% specificity at the optimal cut-off of 6.95 mg/L), comparable to that of serum CRP (AUC = 0.98; 89.1% sensitivity and 95.4% specificity at 10.3 mg/L cut-off). Levels of CRP in serum and saliva were strongly correlated (Spearman's ρ = 0.963, p < 0.001) and overall showed good agreement on Bland-Altman. Although larger discrepancies (>10 mg/L) occurred in 29% of cases, there was no consistent bias favoring either the salivary or serum CRP measurements. Salivary CRP is a promising non-invasive biomarker for diagnosing acute appendicitis in children, demonstrating diagnostic performance closely comparable to that of serum CRP and acceptable agreement between the two measures. This method may reduce the need for invasive blood sampling and streamline early evaluation in pediatric emergency settings."

    "title": "Cross-Sectional Imaging of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease: Diagnostic Pearls and Pitfalls on CT and MR.",
    "abstract": "Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) encompasses a broad range of infection-induced inflammatory disorders of the female upper genital tract, commonly caused by ascending sexually transmitted infections. Diagnosis is often challenging because of nonspecific or absent symptoms and the overlap with other pelvic pathologies. While clinical and laboratory assessments are essential, cross-sectional imaging plays a pivotal role, especially in complicated, atypical, or equivocal cases. This review focuses on the typical and atypical imaging features of PID and highlights the crucial roles of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in its diagnostic evaluation. CT is frequently employed in emergency settings because of its widespread availability and ability to detect acute complications such as tubo-ovarian abscesses (TOA), peritonitis, or Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome. However, it is limited by ionizing radiation and suboptimal soft-tissue contrast. MRI provides superior tissue characterization and multiplanar imaging without radiation exposure. When combined with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), MRI achieves high diagnostic accuracy, particularly in differentiating PID from other entities such as endometriosis, adnexal tumors, and gastrointestinal or urinary tract diseases. This review also addresses PID in specific clinical contexts, including post-partum infection, post-assisted reproductive technologies (ART), intrauterine device (IUD) use, and chronic or recurrent forms. A comprehensive, multimodal imaging approach integrated with clinical findings is essential for timely diagnosis, effective treatment, and prevention of severe reproductive sequelae."

    "title": "Value of Early Kinetics of Procalcitonin with Point-of-Care Test to Predict Postoperative Abscess Following Non-Complicated Acute Appendicitis: A Pilot Study.",
    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency, and while appendectomy typically results in good outcomes, post-operative complications, like intra-abdominal abscesses, can occur. Traditional biomarkers, such as white blood cells count and C-reactive protein, often lack the accuracy needed for early detection. Procalcitonin is emerging as a potential marker for predicting post-operative infections. This pilot study evaluates the role of kinetics of procalcitonin, measured via point-of-care testing, in predicting abscess formation in patients with non-complicated appendicitis. Materials and Methods: The study involved 33 patients undergoing appendectomy for non-complicated acute appendicitis. The levels of procalcitonin were measured at four time points: pre-operatively (T0), post-operatively (T1), on the first post-operative day (T2), and at discharge (T3). The primary outcome was the development of post-operative abscesses, confirmed by imaging or intervention. Results: Four patients (12%) developed abscesses. The levels of procalcitonin were significantly higher in the abscess group at all time points compared to the non-abscess group (p < 0.05). The levels of procalcitonin in the abscess group plateaued after an initial post-operative decline, while levels steadily decreased in the non-abscess group. Conclusions: Procalcitonin, particularly its kinetic profile, may serve as a valuable early marker for predicting post-operative abscess formation. Point-of-care testing for procalcitonin can enable timely intervention, improving outcomes. Kinetics of procalcitonin show promise as a predictor for post-operative abscesses after appendectomy, though larger studies are needed to confirm these findings."

    "abstract": "Background: Small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (SI-NETs) are the most common malignancies of the small bowel. Although typically well differentiated and slow-growing, they may exhibit aggressive behavior, especially when diagnosed at an advanced stage. Objective: To illustrate the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of advanced SI-NETs through a rare case presentation and a narrative review of recent studies in the literature. Methods: A narrative literature review was conducted using the PubMed database to examine the incidence, risk factors, diagnostic modalities, and treatment strategies for advanced-stage SI-NETs. The search included studies published between January 2010 and June 2025 and focused on human subjects, using keywords such as \"small intestinal neuroendocrine tumor\", \"metastasis\", \"tumor grade\", and \"treatment\". Results: We report the case of a 68-year-old man who presented with bowel obstruction. Imaging and surgical exploration revealed a jejunoileal SI-NET with extensive liver and peritoneal metastases, mesenteric fibrosis, and ascites. Histopathology confirmed a well-differentiated grade 2 tumor (Ki-67: 3%) positive for chromogranin A and CD56. Despite a low proliferative index, the tumor demonstrated aggressive clinical behavior. The patient underwent emergency enterectomy with ileostomy and was referred for further evaluation, including somatostatin receptor imaging and consideration for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). Conclusions: This case highlights the potential for aggressive progression in well-differentiated SI-NETs with low Ki-67 indices. Histological grade alone may not predict clinical behavior. Early diagnosis, comprehensive staging, and individualized multidisciplinary management-guided by functional imaging and receptor profiling-are critical to improving outcomes in advanced SI-NETs."

    "abstract": "Background: Water beads are estimated to have caused >8000 emergency department (ED) visits from 2017 to 2022. Lethality after ingestion has been reported. The literature to guide management is scarce. We aimed to characterize three notable cases of water bead ingestions. Methods: We report the patient's presentations, diagnostic modalities, clinical courses, intervention(s) required, and outcomes of the three children who ingested water beads. Results: All patients (ages 8 months-36 months old) presented to the ED with concern for water bead ingestion. Two developed clinical small bowel obstruction and required laparotomy-both required repeat laparotomy after further expansion of previously missed beads. The third patient ingested dozens of water beads but did not develop an obstruction or require surgery. X-rays, cross-sectional imaging, and ultrasounds were employed with variable results. Conclusions: While variable bead expansion rates can necessitate multiple interventions in some children, older children may be less prone to obstructing after water bead ingestion. This case series demonstrates the variability in presentation, management, and outcome of an increasingly common pediatric surgical problem."

    "title": "Barriers to Care Leading to Fatal Consequences: A Case of Tuberculosis Sepsis Amid Policy Change.",
    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an acid-fast bacterium with a diverse range of clinical manifestations and is considered rare in Western countries. Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health concern and can pose several challenges in diagnosis and treatment. Paired with changing immigration policies, immigrant populations can face several barriers to healthcare. This case illustrates the impact of immigration policy on clinical outcomes and how government policies can act as a barrier to care. We present a case of a 26-year-old Guatemalan man with no known past medical history who came to the emergency department hemodynamically unstable with the presentation of abdominal perforation. He was urgently taken for an exploratory laparotomy, which revealed two perforations in the terminal ileum, extensive fibrinous exudate in the peritoneal cavity, and significant lymphadenopathy in the mesentery and retroperitoneum. The specimens collected intraoperatively were sent for evaluation and showed necrotizing granulomatous inflammation with transmural necrosis, and mesenteric lymph node biopsy revealed necrotizing granulomatous lymphadenitis, findings consistent with TB lymphadenitis. A sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) test further confirmed Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Given the concern for disseminated TB and ongoing ventilator and pressor support, this case required a multidisciplinary critical care course. The patient was started on antimycobacterial therapy with plans to transition to RIPE (rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) therapy plus vitamin B6. The patients' hospital course was further complicated by loculated ascites with peritonitis and necrotizing pneumonia. Despite aggressive multidisciplinary medical therapy, the patient ultimately expired. The treatment of sepsis due to disseminated TB depends heavily on the ability to identify the causal infection, in addition to providing hemodynamic and organ support. The research stressing the timeliness of treatment and its impact on mortality in sepsis and miliary TB is well documented across medical literature. In this case, it is critical to analyze the political climate that may have prevented the patient from presenting to a healthcare provider when he first experienced symptoms."

    "abstract": "Avoidance of a hernia recurrence is the most desirable outcome following an on abdominal wall reconstruction, prompting all hernia publications to quote hernia recurrence rates. However, the scientific literature reports recurrence as a dichotomous outcome without evaluating the quality of life or clinical history of patients who present with recurrence after a hernia repair. There is a need for more granular information on the quality of life of patients with hernia recurrence and a need for standardization to allow for comparisons of future studies. The objective of our study is to propose a novel classification for hernia recurrence after ventral hernia repair. We investigated known classification systems published in the literature such as the Clavien-Dindo classification for surgical complication, The European Hernia Society (EHS) classification, the Morales-Conde classification for seroma and created a new system to evaluate ventral hernia recurrence based on the clinical history of patients presenting with recurrence. A new classification system with five grades was created based on the patient's quality of life and clinical outcomes. Grade 0 - no recurrence. Grade IA - Asymptomatic recurrence, identified by a surgeon or imaing with no need for surgical intervention. Grade IB - Asymptomatic recurrence, patient reported, with no need for surgical intervention. Grade IIA - Symptomatic recurrence with no surgical inveetnion (watchful watiting). Grade IIB - Symptomaotic reucrruence which requires elective repair. Grade III - Symptomatic recurrence requiring an urgent repair with no evidence of a Grade IV hernia recurrence. Grade IV - Life-threatening complications directly related to the recurrence - Strangulation, Bowel Ischemia, Bowel Obstruction, Perforation, Abdominal Compartment Syndrome; Septic Shock, Requiring emergent operation. Grade V - Death of patient directly or related to a complication from the hernia recurrence. Grade IV - Death of a patient not related to the hernia recurrence. A classification for hernia recurrence and division on subgroups was formulated to better understand the clinical outcomes of patients with recurrence after ventral hernia repair and to unify criteria among surgeons when describing it."

    "abstract": "The significant role of pyroptosis in the early pathogenesis of ischemic stroke underscores the urgent need for effective management strategies. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a noninvasive modality for modulating brain activity, has been shown to confer neuroprotection by inhibiting neuroinflammation during the acute phase of stroke. However, the specific mechanisms underlying the effect of tDCS on neuronal pyroptosis remain largely unexplored. We established brain I/R injury in adult male Sprague Dawley rats through a middle artery occlusion (MCAO) model. tDCS treatment began 24 h after MCAO and lasts for 6 consecutive days. Evaluate neurobehavioral deficits through an improved Neurological Severity Score (mNSS), Western blot, immunofluorescence staining, TUNEL staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to evaluate the expression of pyroptosis related proteins, cell morphology, and levels of inflammatory factors. The results showed that tDCS markedly reduced the levels of NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis proteins (NLRP3, ASC, cleaved-Caspase-1, and GSDMD-N), accompanied by a reduction in the number of cell membrane perforation and cell death related to pyroptosis. Moreover, tDCS increased the expression of NTN-1, which inhibited the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ)/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Knockdown of NTN-1 reversed the anti-pyroptosis and neuroprotective effect of tDCS. In conclusion, tDCS exerted neuroprotection by curbing neuronal pyroptosis through the NTN-1-mediated PPAR-γ/NF- κB pathway, and could be a useful strategy for ischemic stroke recovery."

    "abstract": "The efficacy and safety of secukinumab up to week 52 in children and adolescents with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis have been demonstrated previously (NCT03668613). Herein, we report the long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of secukinumab over a period of up to 208 weeks. In this randomized open-label trial, patients (6 to < 18 years) were randomized 1:1 to receive low-dose (LD; N = 42) or high-dose (HD; N = 42) secukinumab stratified by weight (< 25 kg, 25 to < 50 kg, or ≥ 50 kg) and disease severity (moderate or severe). Patients weighing < 25 kg received 75 mg secukinumab (both LD and HD); 25 to < 50 kg received 75 mg (LD) or 150 mg (HD) secukinumab; and ≥ 50 kg received 150 mg (LD) or 300 mg (HD) secukinumab. The study assessed Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75/90/100 response, Investigator's Global Assessment modified 2011 (IGA mod 2011) 0/1 response, Children's Dermatology Life Quality (CDLQI) 0/1 response, and safety. The impact of secukinumab treatment on physical development was also assessed. Overall, 79.8% (67 of 84) enrolled patients completed 4 years of treatment (secukinumab LD [N = 31] and secukinumab HD [N = 36]). Both treatment groups showed sustained PASI and IGA mod 0/1 responses throughout the treatment period (at week 208, PASI 75/90/100 [secukinumab LD: 96.3%/88.9%/51.9%; secukinumab HD: 87.9%/81.8%/72.7%] and IGA mod 2011 0/1 [secukinumab LD: 85.2%; secukinumab HD: 84.8%]). Mean PASI score remained low in both treatment groups, from week 12 through week 208; at week 208, mean percentage change in PASI scores from baseline was - 95.7% (mean absolute score: 18.46 [baseline]; 0.76 [week 208]) with secukinumab LD and - 94.5% (mean absolute score: 19.25 [baseline]; 1.07 [week 208]) with secukinumab HD. CDLQI 0/1 response remained high in both treatment groups from week 12 through week 208 (secukinumab LD: 75.0%; secukinumab HD: 88.2%). Safety profile of secukinumab with long-term (~313.9 patient-years) treatment was favorable and in line with the known safety profile reported previously for 52-week treatment. No dose-dependent safety observations were noted. There were no deaths recorded throughout the entire duration of the treatment. Nonfatal serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in four (9.5%) patients in the LD group (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19], Crohn's disease, infectious mononucleosis, intentional self-injury, tibia fracture) and two (4.8%) patients in the HD group (appendicitis, tonsillitis). The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar in both secukinumab dose groups (LD [78.6%] and HD [83.3%]). No impact on the growth and development, or sexual maturation of pediatric patients, was noted with long-term treatment. Secukinumab demonstrated sustained long-term efficacy and improved quality of life through week 208 in pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. The treatment was well tolerated, and safety data were consistent with the known favorable safety profile of secukinumab. NCT03668613."

    "abstract": "Intestinal obstruction remains a common surgical emergency associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, especially in low- and middle-income countries. The evolving epidemiology, emergence of postoperative adhesions as a leading cause, and adoption of modern surgical practices necessitate updated real-world analyses. A retrospective study was conducted on 200 patients who underwent surgical management for intestinal obstruction at Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, New Delhi, India, between January 2018 and December 2023. Demographic, clinical, radiologic, intraoperative, and outcome data were collected. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Postoperative adhesions (32%) and external hernias (18%) were the most common causes of obstruction. Abdominal pain (100%), vomiting (94%), and distension (88%) were the predominant presenting symptoms. Computed tomography (CT) scans were performed in 35% of cases and led to changes in surgical planning in over 60% of those patients. Surgical interventions included adhesiolysis (32%), hernia repair (18%), bowel resection with anastomosis (24%), and stoma creation (9%). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 7%. On multivariate analysis, the significant predictors of mortality were strangulated obstruction (OR 5.2, P = 0.002), delayed presentation >48 h (OR 3.8, P = 0.02), and presence of peritonitis (OR 2.9, P = 0.03). Partial enhanced recovery after surgery implementation in 48% of patients was associated with shorter hospital stay and fewer infectious complications. This large single-center study identifies the key predictors of mortality and highlights the practical role of CT imaging and enhanced recovery protocols in the surgical management of intestinal obstruction. Early referral, timely surgical intervention, and protocol-driven care are essential to improve the outcomes in resource-constrained settings.

    "title": "Improving Appendicitis Prediction in Children Using the Paediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS): A Three-Year Retrospective Study.",
    "abstract": "Introduction Acute appendicitis is a leading surgical emergency in children, yet diagnosis remains challenging. The Paediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS) was developed to standardise risk stratification using clinical and laboratory indicators. While its diagnostic accuracy has been validated in controlled settings, its real-world application remains variable. This paper aimed to evaluate the impact of implementing PAS into routine clinical assessment at an NHS district-general hospital. The objectives were to reduce negative appendicectomy rates and improve diagnostic accuracy. Materials and methods A two-cycle retrospective audit was conducted at Southend University Hospital. Cycle 1 (August 2021-August 2024) included 156 paediatric patients who underwent appendicectomy. In August 2024, an educational intervention was introduced. It involved departmental teaching and dissemination of a quick-reference guide aligned with the Getting It Right First Time (GIRFT) abdominal pain pathway. Cycle 2 (August 2024-March 2025) included 34 cases. Patients under 18 years undergoing appendicectomy were included. The data collected included demographics, PAS scores, and histological outcomes. Diagnostic performance of PAS was evaluated by plotting the PAS value against the final histological outcome, using sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, likelihood ratios, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Results A total of 190 patients were analysed. The negative appendicectomy rate fell from 29.5% (Cycle 1) to 17.6% (Cycle 2) following the educational intervention, although this was not statistically significant (p=0.16). In the combined cohort, PAS ≥7 achieved 87% specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.89, but only 40% sensitivity. PAS ≥4 maximised sensitivity (96%) but reduced specificity (31%). Mean PAS was significantly higher in confirmed cases (6.18 vs 4.69; p < 0.001). The AUC-ROC was 0.73. Discussion Across the full cohort, PAS showed expected trade-offs: at a high threshold (≥7), the tool provided good specificity (87%) but reduced sensitivity (40%), whereas a low threshold (≥4) delivered high sensitivity (96%) but poor specificity (31%). These findings are lower than those reported in the initial derivation cohort but broadly consistent with subsequent external validation studies. The score's modest AUC-ROC (0.73) underlines the need for adjuncts such as imaging in equivocal cases. Post-intervention trends suggest improved adherence to PAS-based risk stratification and reduced avoidable surgeries, although small sample size possibly led to poor statistical power. Conclusions Integrating PAS into routine assessment improved risk stratification and reduced the negative appendicectomy rate, although without statistical significance. High scores (≥7) remained highly specific, low scores (≤3) safely ruled out disease, and mid-range scores benefited from adjuncts such as imaging or serial review. Continued use within a structured pathway is advisable, but larger multicentre studies, and the inclusion of imaging adjuncts, are recommended to refine the score and therefore improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce negative appendicectomy rates."

    "title": "Transanal Intrusion Avoided: A Rare Case of Pediatric Accidental Penetrating Gluteal Trauma Induced by a Pencil Without Internal Perforation.",
    "abstract": "Penetrating injuries to the gluteal region are rare in children and often pose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge due to the proximity of vital pelvic structures such as the rectum, bladder, and major vessels. Injuries caused by common classroom supplies like pencils are uncommon, but their ability to penetrate deeply into the pelvis warrants high suspicion for visceral injury. Here, we report a case of an 11-year-old previously healthy boy who suffered a left-sided gluteal injury after unintentionally sitting on a pencil placed upright on a chair as a prank during school hours. Initial assessment showed a puncture wound without external bleeding or signs of peritonitis. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the pelvis revealed a linear foreign body measuring 12.4 cm in length passing through the ischiorectal fossa and appearing to penetrate the posterior rectosigmoid wall, with the tip located inside the lumen. Despite imaging suggesting rectal perforation, diagnostic laparoscopy and colonoscopy showed no mucosal injury, contamination, or any signs of perforation. The foreign body was successfully removed through the entry wound, and the patient was managed conservatively with intravenous antibiotics and close clinical monitoring. Postoperatively, he developed abdominal pain and elevated inflammatory markers, with ultrasound revealing a small retrorectal fluid collection that improved with ongoing conservative care. He fully recovered and remained asymptomatic on follow-up. The aim of the report is to highlight a rare case and underscore the importance of correlating imaging findings with surgical and endoscopic assessments in pediatric trauma and support a purposeful, minimally invasive targeted treatment approach in the absence of obvious perforation or systemic compromise."

    "title": "Clinical Outcomes of Critically Ill Patients with Candida spp. Peritonitis: A Retrospective Cohort Study.",
    "abstract": "Introduction/objectives: Peritonitis resulting from Candida spp. is common among critically ill patients and has been associated with adverse clinical outcomes. This study aimed to determine the effects of isolates of Candida species in patients with peritonitis on in-hospital mortality, general hospital stay, and intensive care unit (ICU) stays. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in two highly complex hospitals in Bogotá, Colombia, specifically by reference to patients who were hospitalized in the ICU between 2016 and 2022 with a clinical and microbiological diagnosis of peritonitis. For the analysis conducted for this research, two groups were established: patients with isolates of Candida spp. in the peritoneum and patients who had at least one bacterial microorganism in the culture. Multivariate logistic regression models and counting models featuring different mortality outcomes, different lengths of stay in the ICU, and different lengths of stay in the hospital were generated to evaluate the effect of the presence of Candida spp. and to account for potentially confounding variables. Results: A total of 373 patients, including 83 with Candida spp. and 290 with a bacterial etiology, were identified. Among the former group of patients, the most frequently identified species were C. albicans (50, 60.2%), C. tropicalis (18, 21.7%), and C. glabrata (7, 8.4%), whereas among the latter group, E. coli (186, 48.5%), K. pneumoniae (110, 29.8%), and E. faecalis (63, 16.9%) were most frequent. The 30-day mortality rate among patients with peritonitis and Candida isolates was 36.1%, and the corresponding rate among patients in the bacterial peritonitis group was 31.4% (p = 0.071). After adjustments were made to account for covariates, no significant differences were observed in mortality at 30 days (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.20-1.18), length of hospital stay (iRR 1.11, 95% CI 0.90-1.40), or length of stay in the ICU (iRR 1.11, 95% CI 0.39) with respect to patients with peritonitis without fungal isolates. The Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS2) (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.03-1.06), World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) score (OR 1.11, (1.03-1.19), previous use of antifungals (OR 2.33, 1.21-4.52), and connective tissue disease (OR 3.71, 95% CI 1.30-10.99) were associated with 30-day mortality. Conclusions: The isolation of Candida species in peritoneal fluid from critically ill patients with peritonitis was not significantly associated with in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay, or length of ICU stay after adjustments were made to account for other variables."

    "abstract": "Background Hollow viscus perforation is a surgical emergency with variable outcomes. The surgical Apgar score (SAS) offers a simple method for risk stratification, but its utility in the patient population is unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the role of SAS in predicting postoperative complications in patients undergoing surgery for hollow viscus perforation. Methods This prospective observational study included 106 patients aged 18 years and above who underwent surgery for hollow viscus perforation at a tertiary care center in Tripura, India, between August 2022 and January 2024. The SAS was calculated intraoperatively based on estimated blood loss, lowest mean arterial pressure, and lowest heart rate. Postoperative complications were graded using the Clavien-Dindo classification. The correlation between SAS and complication severity was analyzed. Results The mean age of the participants was 41.3 ± 15.2 years, with male predominance (87%, 92/106). Gastric perforation was most common (67.9%, 72/106). The most frequently observed SAS was 6, accounting for 39.6% (42/106) of the cases. A strong negative correlation was found between the SAS and Clavien-Dindo grade (Spearman's ρ = -0.664, p < 0.001), indicating that lower SASs were associated with higher grades of complications. Conclusion The SAS demonstrated a significant inverse correlation with postoperative complication severity in patients who had undergone surgery for hollow viscus perforation. The SAS may serve as a simple yet effective tool for predicting outcomes and informing postoperative management in this setting."

    "title": "Four-Year Emicizumab Treatment in an Elderly Patient With Acquired Hemophilia A: A Case Report on Perioperative Management Along With a Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a life-threatening bleeding disorder caused by autoantibodies against coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). While immunosuppressive therapy (IST) can eradicate these autoantibodies, it may fail or cause adverse events, especially in elderly patients. Clinical trials involving AHA patients have confirmed the efficiency of emicizumab, a bispecific antibody mimicking FVIII widely used in congenital hemophilia A with or without inhibitors, but the long-term safety and effectiveness in perioperative hemostatic management remain unclear. These issues are important due to the high risk of thrombosis in AHA patients. This report details four years of continuous use of emicizumab and perioperative management in an elderly woman in her 90s with IST-resistant/intolerant AHA. She was diagnosed with AHA one year before the initiation of emicizumab. After initially responding to steroid pulse therapy with a tentative fall in FVIII autoantibodies, she experienced recurrences and repetitive episodes of massive cutaneous bleeding within a year during corticosteroid tapering, which required continuous high-dose steroid therapy. Emicizumab was initiated via enrollment in the AGEHA clinical trial. During the four years of continuous use (the longest reported duration), no major bleeding or adverse events were recorded. The patient underwent emergency surgery for appendicitis, during which hemostasis was maintained with recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa). Despite minimal intraoperative blood loss, prolonged drain-site bleeding occurred, possibly due to low emicizumab levels indicated by FVIII activity measured by chromogenic assay. rFVIIa was tapered gradually to postoperative day 27 without thrombotic complications. This case highlights the utility of emicizumab in IST-resistant AHA patients by achieving effective hemostasis and safety against IST-related toxicity. It also demonstrates the beneficial effects of rFVIIa in hemostasis during surgery, emphasizing the importance of careful monitoring in balancing bleeding and thrombotic risks."

    "title": "A Comparative Study of Harmonic Scalpel Versus Suture Ligation for Appendix Base Closure in Patients With Appendicitis Undergoing Laparoscopic Appendectomy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.",
    "abstract": "Background and objective Appendicitis is a common cause of acute abdominal pain and a frequent indication for emergency abdominal surgery. Laparoscopic appendectomy has become the preferred surgical treatment due to its many advantages over open appendectomy, including reduced morbidity, shorter hospital stay, and faster recovery. A critical step in laparoscopic appendectomy is the secure closure of the appendix stump to prevent postoperative complications. While laparoscopic appendectomy is widely practiced, there is no consensus on the optimal method for appendix stump closure. This prospective study aimed to compare the harmonic scalpel (HS) with suture ligation (SL) for appendix base closure in terms of operative time, surgical site infection (SSI), postoperative pain, postoperative ileus, and hospital stay. Methods This prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted at the Department of General Surgery, GSVM Medical College, Kanpur, involving 60 patients with appendicitis undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy. The data entry was performed using Microsoft Excel. The final statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS Statistics version 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Continuous variables were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median with interquartile range (IQR), depending on data distribution. Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies and percentages. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 60 patients were randomized into two groups (30 each): HS and SL. The most affected age group was 18-42 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.2:1. The mean operative time was significantly shorter in the HS group (28.4 ± 6.2 minutes) compared to the SL group (43.3 ± 7.1 minutes, p<0.05). Postoperative pain scores were lower in the HS group at six, 24, and 48 hours (p<0.05). SSI (6.6% vs. 13.3%), postoperative ileus (6.6% vs. 13.3%), and readmission rates (3.3% vs. 10%) were all lower in the HS group. Hospital stay was also reduced (2.8 ± 1.2 vs. 3.5 ± 1.4 days, p<0.05), and patients returned to normal activities earlier. Conclusions This study demonstrates HS is a safe and effective alternative to suture ligation, offering improved surgical outcomes and faster recovery for appendiceal stump closure during laparoscopic appendectomy. HS significantly reduces operative time, postoperative pain, complication rates, hospital stay, and readmissions, while enhancing recovery and overall patient outcomes."

We report the case of a previously healthy 48-year-old woman who presented with acute anal pain and constipation. Despite initial conservative management, her symptoms rapidly worsened. Cross-sectional imaging revealed a large fecaloma in the sigmoid colon with signs of colonic ischemia and perforation. Emergency laparotomy confirmed a substantial anterior rectal wall perforation, and a Hartmann's procedure was performed. Histopathological examination demonstrated transmural necrosis and ulceration consistent with stercoral disease. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course, with resolution of sepsis and stabilization of hematologic abnormalities. This case highlights the importance of early recognition and imaging in patients with severe constipation and abdominal symptoms. Stercoral perforation, though rare, must be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen, and timely surgical intervention remains essential to prevent catastrophic outcomes."

    "abstract": "A 45-year-old female presented to the Emergency Department with acute right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain. Her past medical history was significant for heavy menstrual bleeding and moderate dysmenorrhea, though a diagnosis of endometriosis had never been established previously. Initial work-up revealed anemia and leucocytosis. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed an enlarged structure in RLQ along the medial border of the cecum, suspicious for acute appendicitis with a retained rupture. CA19-9, CA-125, and CEA were sent, of which only CA-125 was elevated at 92.7 U/mL (reference range: 0-35 U/mL). She was admitted to the hospital for complicated appendicitis and was started on IV piperacillin-tazobactam. A repeat CT scan to monitor response to antibiotics showed acute appendicitis along with phlegmon with a small amount of free fluid, and an enlarged heterogeneous uterus with thickened endometrium, uterine fibroids, and a left ovarian cyst. A CT-guided drainage by Interventional Radiology (IR) was deferred due to concerns for a suspected malignant appendiceal mass, and she was treated with 14 days of antibiotics in the setting of complicated appendicitis. An appendiceal biopsy via colonoscopy after discharge revealed a serrated adenoma. The patient underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy and a right hemicolectomy due to concern for appendiceal malignancy. The final histopathology showed a 2.8 cm endometriotic mass involving the wall of the appendix and surrounding tissue, one diverticulum of the colon, and was negative for dysplasia and malignancy. She had a further gynecologic workup with an in-office hysteroscopy, endometrial biopsy, and a pelvic MRI. The pathology showed no evidence of atypical hyperplasia or malignancy. The MRI revealed numerous uterine leiomyomas, adenomyosis, and a left adnexal endometrioma measuring 3.6 x 3.2 cm. She underwent a subsequent robotic-assisted total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, left oophorectomy, right ovarian cystectomy, and extensive adhesiolysis/enterolysis with intraoperative colorectal surgery consultation. Her post-operative course was uncomplicated. This report highlights the importance of considering extragonadal endometriosis in women of reproductive age as a differential diagnosis for RLQ pain and mass. It also underscores the importance of investigating the preoperative findings of appendiceal masses in women of childbearing age with appendiceal endometriosis presenting as an acute abdomen."

This retrospective cohort study in an acute NHS Hospital Trust from 01/01/2019-31/12/2022 examines a change in practice from emergency surgery (ES) to colonic stenting for patients with both left and right sided acute malignant LBO. Co-primary outcomes were clinically successful bowel decompression following stenting and 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were length of stay, stent complications, stoma formation and minimally invasive surgery (MIS). 68 patients underwent colonic stenting, and 29 patients underwent primary ES for acute malignant LBO. Stenting achieved successful bowel decompression in 77.9%. 30-day mortality for those initially stented was 7.4% and for ES 6.9%. In palliative patients initially treated with stenting the stoma rate was lower (15.4 vs. 100.0%) with a reduced rate of open surgery (5.1 vs 87.5%) when compared to ES. In curative patients initially treated with stenting the stoma rate was lower (37.9 vs. 80.1%) with an increased rate of MIS (69.0 vs 19.0%), when compared to ES. 27.9% of patients underwent stenting proximal to the splenic flexure. It is possible to offer colonic stenting to > 80% of patients presenting with acute malignant LBO despite not having a 24/7 rota. There was a reduced rate of stoma formation, open surgery and length of stay in both palliative and curative patients undergoing primary colonic stenting."

    "title": "Optimal Closure Timing for Protective Jejunostomy in an Infant with Necrotizing Enterocolitis: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a prevalent, life-threatening gastrointestinal disease in premature neonates, characterized by intestinal inflammation, ischemia, and potential perforation. Protective measures such as ostomies of various types are a strategy to help patients during recovery from postoperative complications. Protective jejunostomy (PJ) in such cases aims to minimize intraluminal pressure and protect distal anastomoses or compromised bowel segments. However, the optimal timing for closure remains a matter of debate, between balancing bowel rest and avoiding complications associated with prolonged ostomies. CASE REPORT We report an unusual case of a 6-month-old female patient, who presented with NEC and extensive intestinal compromise. Emergency laparotomy revealed multiple areas of bowel perforation and partial ischemia without perfusion. Surgical management included selective resection of non-viable bowel segments, primary closure of smaller perforations, creation of a PJ, and a distal ileostomy. The \"clip and drop\" technique was not used; instead, distal bowel patency was confirmed by a second intraoperative assessment and through intestinal saline solution injection on the tenth postoperative day due to high stoma output and persistent hydroelectrolyte imbalance. Postoperatively, the patient developed 2 new ileal perforations, requiring reoperation. Following the third surgical intervention, the patient demonstrated gradual recovery without major complications, followed by elective ileostomy closure after 6 months. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the complexity of the surgical option and timing of PJ closure in complicated NEC in a 6-month-old female patient. Early closure can mitigate complications related to the stoma but carries the risk of compromising the fragile and recovering intestine. Decision-making must be careful and individualized, balancing the risks and benefits."

    "abstract": "Retrograde colonic intussusception is a rare condition in adults, often caused by organic lesions such as tumors. Autonomic dysfunction in disorders like multiple system atrophy (MSA) might contribute to its occurrence. An 81-year-old bedridden woman with a history of MSA presented with severe abdominal pain and abdominal distension lasting 4 days. She had chronic severe constipation managed with laxatives and manual disimpaction. CT imaging revealed retrograde intussusception of the rectum into the sigmoid colon. Endoscopic reduction was attempted but was unsuccessful due to scope impassability. Emergency laparotomy identified a 4-5 cm tumor at the lead point, and manual reduction resulted in bowel perforation. Hartmann's procedure with D2 lymphadenectomy was performed. The tumor was histopathologically diagnosed as a tubulovillous adenoma with no malignant features. The patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful except for a urinary tract infection (Clavien-Dindo Grade II), and she was transferred to a rehabilitation facility on postoperative day 24. Failure of reduction by air enema should raise suspicion for retrograde intussusception, warranting prompt surgery if an organic lead point is suspected."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a prevalent gastrointestinal disorder that consists primarily of two types: simple bowel obstruction (SiBO) and strangulated bowel obstruction (StBO). Due to life-threatening complications such as septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, there is an urgent need for an easy-to-acquire predictive model for StBO based on clinical symptoms and laboratory. A total of 453 patients diagnosed with SBO were randomly divided into training and validation datasets at a ratio of 7:3. The demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was employed to identify relevant variables, and a multivariable logistic regression (LR) model was subsequently developed. The performance of the model was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and diagnostic metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC), were calculated. Of the 453 patients diagnosed with SBO, 62 (13.7%) had StBO, and 391 (86.3%) had SiBO. Univariate analysis revealed significant associations between bowel ischemia and the following variables: body mass index (BMI, p = 0.027), neutrophil percentage (N, p = 0.002), aspartate aminotransferase (AST, p = 0.024), serum creatinine (p = 0.030), serum urea (p = 0.019), glucose (p = 0.029), prothrombin time (PT, p = 0.043), cessation of defecation and flatus (p = 0.013), tenderness (p = 0.004), and rebound tenderness (p < 0.001). A LASSO regression model with optimized regularization parameters (α = 0.3, λ = 0.0202; log[λ] = - 3.902) was used to select 10 predictors. Rebound tenderness (OR, 6.64; 95% CI, 2.97-15.48; p < 0.001), BMI (OR, 0.02; 95% CI, 0.00-0.37; p = 0.010), N (OR, 1.05; 95% CI,1.01-1.09; p = 0.009), and AST (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.01-4.06, p = 0.055) were significantly associated with intestinal ischemia via multivariable LR. The final predictive model (BAR-N) had a strong performance, with an AUC of 0.784 in the training cohort and 0.750 in the validation cohort. Additionally, the model exhibited high specificity (90.3%) and accuracy (80.7%), although its sensitivity remained relatively low at 31.8%. We developed an easy-to-acquire predictive model (BAR-N) for the diagnosis of StBO that incorporates both clinical and laboratory data. This model shows promise as an adjunctive decision-support tool, particularly in resource-limited or high-acuity settings. However, its generalizability is limited by the absence of external validation, underscoring the need for future multicenter studies to confirm its broader applicability."

    "abstract": "Background and Clinical Significance:Anaerococcus tetradius (A. tetradius) and Gardnerella vaginalis (G. vaginalis) are rare etiological factors for postpartum endometritis and are typically associated with bacterial vaginosis. However, in some cases, G. vaginalis and A. tetradius can cause serious postpartum endometritis with complications such as sepsis. Case Presentation: 26-year-old pregnant woman expecting monochorionic diamniotic twins presented to the hospital at 35 weeks and 3 days of gestation and two male infants were delivered via the Cesarean section. On the fifth day after delivery, the patient began to complain of intense abdominal pain, a fever of 37.9 °C, and overall weakness. Blood tests revealed neutrophilic leukocytosis, increased C-reactive protein (CRP) of 225.4 mg/L. Upon examination, abdominal distension, tenderness on palpation, and positive symptoms of peritoneal irritation were present and the site of the abdominal incision was inflamed with flowing foul-smelling greenish pus. Ultrasound examination revealed free fluid collection in the peritoneal cavity, under the liver, and around the uterus. Later, the condition of the patient worsened with progressing hypotension and respiratory distress. As a result, suppurative peritonitis and sepsis was suspected and the patient underwent urgent total hysterectomy without oophorectomy. Acute endometritis, focal myometritis, and chronic cervicitis were concluded from histopathological examination of the removed uterus. Microbiological tests showed the most abundant growth of A. tetradius in the wound cultures and great abundance of G. vaginalis in the abdominal cavity cultures. After trying three different treatment schemes and difficulties with determining the antibiotic sensitivity tests for pathogens, the antibacterial therapy was escalated to Meropenem, which was found to be effective, and the patient was discharged home. Conclusions: This case report highlights the severity of complications of postpartum endometritis that can be caused by rare pathogens (such as G. vaginalis and A. tetradius), and strategies for how to manage it. The clinical presentation of a patient should be monitored closely for several days after Cesarean section and if endometritis is suspected, microbiological cultures are necessary to determine the cause of infection and implement an appropriate treatment."

Case I: A recurrent gastric perforation managed via wedge resection using linear staplers, reinforced with Lembert sutures to ensure staple-line integrity. Case II: A delayed duodenal perforation treated with Heineke-Mikulicz duodenoplasty combined with omentoplasty to address tissue edema and mitigate leakage risk. These cases highlight the necessity of adapting surgical strategies to patient-specific factors, such as perforation chronicity, tissue viability, and prior intervention history.

About 6-7% of individuals develop appendicitis during their lifetime, with the highest incidence in young people aged 10 to 19 years of age. The incidence of appendicitis varies between geographical regions and both diet and socioeconomic status are thought to play a role in this difference. Mortality rates are higher in less developed countries. Appendicitis is believed to occur due to obstruction of the lumen of the appendix. Complications such as perforation and abscess formation can occur, so prompt diagnosis is important. A detailed history and physical examination are key components of diagnosis, but blood tests and imaging studies also provide important information. Various scoring systems have been developed to aid in the diagnosis of appendicitis. Surgery is the primary treatment for appendicitis but treatment with antibiotics is also an option."

A late-term fetus presented with reduced fetal movements. Ultrasound revealed moderate ascites, bowel dilation, and the characteristic \"whirlpool sign,\" suggesting intestinal malrotation with volvulus. Doppler ultrasound indicated abnormal umbilical artery blood flow, and cardiotocography (CTG) confirmed fetal distress. An emergency cesarean section was performed after a multidisciplinary consultation. Intraoperative findings revealed intestinal volvulus, and postoperative evaluation confirmed ischemic necrosis. The neonate underwent abdominal paracentesis and received comprehensive treatment, including respiratory support, antimicrobial therapy, and nutritional management. Histopathological examination confirmed localized intestinal necrosis without perforation. The infant recovered well and was discharged in stable condition. Fetal ascites may be an early sign of congenital intestinal malrotation and volvulus. The ultrasound \"whirlpool sign\" indicates intestinal malrotation and possible volvulus, aiding early detection but not confirming bowel necrosis.

Appendicitis in patients with SIT can be diagnostically challenging due to the atypical location of abdominal pain, typically presenting on the left side. Foreign body impacted appendicitis is a rare occurrence. We present a case of a 10-year-old boy presented to the emergency room with complaints of abdominal pain in the left lower abdomen. Acute appendicitis with an impacted foreign body in the lumen of the appendix was found in ultrasonography (USG). Chest X-ray showed dextrocardia and fundic gas under the right hemidiaphragm and the liver shadow on the left illustrating SIT. The patient underwent an urgent midline laparotomy, revealing a left iliac fossa appendix consistent with situs inversus. The inflamed appendix contained a palpable foreign body. The appendix was excised, revealing a sewing machine pin approximately 5 cm in length lodged in the appendiceal lumen. Situs inversus totalis is a rare condition in which the orientation of visceral organs mirrors the normal anatomy. Abdominal pain is one of the most frequent chief complaints among patients in the Emergency department, with appendicitis being the most common surgical condition diagnosed. Left-sided lower abdominal pain can be the presentation of appendicitis in situs inversus totalis. Usual presentation is right-sided pain so doctors do not consider left-sided lower abdominal pain as differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis making atypical presentation difficult to diagnose. Failure to consider this anatomical variation could delay diagnosis, leading to misinterpretation of symptoms and unnecessary or inappropriate investigations. In cases of left lower quadrant pain with dextrocardia and right-sided gastric gas bubble on chest X-ray should be thought of acute appendicitis. USG or computed tomography abdomen must be done to diagnose appendicitis with an impacted foreign body in SIT."

    "title": "Case Report: Suspected intestinal perforation caused by accidental ingestion of magnet.",
    "abstract": "Children frequently swallow foreign objects, and ingesting magnets on occasion can cause major problems because they are composed of unique materials that draw to one another in the intestinal wall. As a result, there is a significant chance of intestinal wall necrosis, intestinal perforation, and fistula formation. On the basis of the history of magnet ingestion, clinical signs like nausea and vomiting, and x-ray imaging, it is easy to diagnose magnet-induced complications. However, there was no foreign body shadow in the x-ray, and some intermittent swallowing of magnets in different intestinal tubes attracted one another, causing intestinal perforation and subsequent discharge along with the feces. We describe the case of an 8-year-old girl who had been consuming two magnets for six days when she arrived at our hospital's emergency room with sporadic stomach ache and vomiting for two days. The youngster had a history of vomiting yellow-green bile, and a physical examination revealed a noticeable intestinal pattern with noticeable periumbilical discomfort. An abdominopelvic CT scan indicated intestinal obstruction, while an abdominal x-ray indicated minimal distension of the intestinal tube and a fluid level. No obvious foreign body shadow was seen in the abdominal cavity. Laparoscopic exploration revealed two perforations, one in the colon and one in the small bowel; no magnets were found intraoperatively. Intraoperative abdominal radiographs suggested loss of signs of limited intestinal distension and no foreign body was seen. Considering the absence of foreign bodies observed during the operation and the patency of the intestine postoperatively, it is reasonably inferred that the magnet was excreted via feces after causing intestinal perforation. The patient's condition was stable after the operation and she was discharged from the hospital after 9 days. This case emphasizes the necessity of maintaining clinical vigilance in pediatric patients with suspected magnet ingestion, even when imaging fails to identify foreign bodies. Notably, the absence of intraoperatively retrieved magnets does not preclude magnet-induced injuries, and early surgical exploration may contribute to improved clinical outcomes."

    "abstract": "A 76-year-old man with effort angina was admitted to Cardiology Department for an elective coronary angiography (CA). Diagnostic CA revealed severely calcified three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) with chronic total occlusions (CTO) of the right dominant coronary artery (RCA) and of the left circumflex artery (LCX) ostium, and severe calcific stenosis of the left descending artery (LAD). An urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to treat LAD was carried out because of ECG modifications and chest pain immediately after CA. During the procedure a septal collateral perforation occurred leading to abrupt development of a large intraventricular septal hematoma (IVSH). Urgent embolization of the distal septal branch with coils was performed using block and deliver (BAD) technique. Rapid hematoma expansion involved another proximal septal collateral. A prompt second coil embolization was carried out arresting the growth of hematoma expansion. The patient was discharged home in stable condition after close observation in Coronary Care Unit (CCU), and subsequently in a low-intensity care unit. Complete resolution of IVSH was confirmed by transthoracic echocardiogram 2 months later. Timely management of the septal perforation and close echocardiographic monitoring resulted in complete hematoma resolution and a satisfactory outcome."

    "abstract": "Correct identification of the etiology and anatomical location of perforations is paramount for ensuring optimal therapeutic intervention and surgical planning in cases of gastrointestinal tract perforation. This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the distinctive multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) findings of intraperitoneal and retro-/extraperitoneal perforation by comparing the locations of free air in the abdomen and other imaging findings. A total of 226 patients with acute abdominal pain who visited the emergency department and underwent contrast-enhanced CT between January 2016 and November 2023 were included. The study consisted of 146 male and 80 female patients with a median age of 53.5 years. Surgical findings determined the site of perforation in all cases. Two radiologists evaluated the CT images in a consensus blind to operative findings, assessing the presence of specific air distributions and strong predictors of gastrointestinal tract perforation. The study included 192 intraperitoneal and 34 retro-/extraperitoneal perforation cases. Subphrenic free air and periportal free air were statistically significant in differentiating intraperitoneal gastrointestinal tract perforation among specific air distributions. Conversely, the presence of free air in the minor pelvis, right lower quadrant, left lower quadrant, and retroperitoneum was significant in differentiating retro-/extraperitoneal gastrointestinal tract perforation. Among strong imaging predictors, only ascites was statistically significant in differentiating intraperitoneal from retro-/extraperitoneal perforations. Findings from MDCT may serve as predictive indicators for the precise localization of gastrointestinal tract perforations, which is crucial for appropriate management and surgical planning. HINTERGRUND: Die korrekte Identifizierung der Ätiologie und anatomischen Lokalisation der Perforation ist entscheidend für die Sicherstellung einer optimalen therapeutischen Intervention und chirurgischen Planung bei Perforationen im Gastrointestinaltrakt. ZIEL: Ziel der vorliegenden Studie war es, retrospektiv die verschiedenen Befunde in der Mehrschicht-Computertomographie (MDCT) bei intraperitonealen und retro-/extraperitonealen Perforationen durch Vergleich der Lokalisation von freier Luft im Abdomen und anderen Befunden zu untersuchen. In die Studie wurden 226 Patienten mit akuten Bauchschmerzen einbezogen, welche sich zwischen Januar 2016 und November 2023 in der Notaufnahme vorstellten und bei denen eine kontrastmittelverstärkte Computertomographie (CT) durchgeführt wurde. Studienteilnehmer waren 146 männliche und 80 weibliche Patienten mit einem mittleren Alter von 53,5 Jahren. In sämtlichen Fällen wurde die Stelle der Perforation anhand der chirurgischen Befunde festgestellt. Zwei Radiologen beurteilten die CT-Aufnahmen in einem Konsensverfahren ohne Kenntnis der operativen Befunde, sie untersuchten dabei das Vorliegen spezifischer Luftverteilungen und starker Prädiktoren einer Perforation im Gastrointestinaltrakt. Die Studie umfasste 192 Fälle mit intraperitonealer und 34 Fälle mit retro-/extraperitonealer Perforation. Subphrenische freie Luft und periportale freie Luft waren von statistisch signifikanter Bedeutung für die Erkennung intraperitonealer Perforationen im Gastrointestinaltrakt anhand spezifischer Luftverteilungen. Dagegen war das Vorliegen freier Luft im kleinen Becken, rechten unteren Quadranten, linken unteren Quadranten und Retroperitoneum von signifikanter Bedeutung für die Erkennung retro-/extraperitonealer Perforationen im Gastrointestinaltrakt. Unter den starken Prädiktoren in der Bildgebung war nur Aszites von statistisch signifikanter Bedeutung bei der Unterscheidung intraperitonealer von retro-/extraperitonealen Perforationen. MDCT-Befunde können als prädiktive Indikatoren für die genaue Lokalisierung von Perforationen im Gastrointestinaltrakt dienen, was entscheidend ist für eine angemessene Versorgung und chirurgische Planung."

    "abstract": "Enterobacter hormaechei (E. hormaechei) is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause various animal diseases under certain conditions, including pneumonia, peritonitis, and pyogenic endometritis. The emergence of multidrug-resistant E. hormaechei has severely limited treatment options, highlighting the urgent need for alternative therapeutic strategies such as bacteriophage therapy. In this study, we isolated and characterized a lytic bacteriophage, vB_EhoP_ZX13, from aquaculture samples using E. hormaechei-Eho13 as the host. Morphological analysis revealed that vB_EhoP_ZX13 exhibited typical long-tailed phage characteristics and belonged to the family Straboviridae. It demonstrated the optimal infection efficiency at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, with a short latent period (5 min) and a high burst size (100 PFU/cell). Furthermore, the phage remained stable at 4-30 °C and pH 5-8, but was sensitive to high temperatures and ultraviolet (UV) light exposure. Genomic analysis revealed a 172,900 bp double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome encoding 295 open reading frames (ORFs) and 19 tRNAs. Crucially, no genes associated with virulence factors, lysogenic genes, or antibiotic resistance-related were identified, supporting its biosafety for therapeutic. In vitro, vB_EhoP_ZX13 significantly inhibited the growth of Eho13. In vivo, phage treatment markedly improved the survival rate of infected mice, with a 90 % survival observed when administered at an MOI of 1. In summary, vB_EhoP_ZX13 is a lytic phage with strong antibacterial activity both in vitro and in vivo, highlighting its promise as an alternative therapeutic agent against E. hormaechei infections."

We investigated how successful these scorings are in terms of excluding urgent gynecological pathologies. Patients who underwent emergency surgery by the general surgery team due to acute abdomen clinic in our hospital between 2018 and 2023 and were detected to have gynecological pathology during the operation were included in the study. General medical characteristics of the patients, preoperative laboratory values, findings in preoperative imaging, Alvarado and AIR scores, final diagnoses, and surgical procedures performed were recorded. A total of 78 patients were included in the study, 39 patients forming the case group and 39 patients forming the control group. No significant difference was found between the control and case groups in terms of the age of the patients, presence of additional diseases, and WBC value (p: 0.877, p: 0.092, p: 0.500). While the rate of normal findings on ultrasonography (USG) in the case group was significantly lower than in the control group (p: 0.001), the rate of normal findings on computed tomography (CT) was significantly higher than in the control group (p: 0.000). CRP value and length of stay in the case group were significantly higher than in the control group (p: 0.050, p: 0.000). There was no statistically significant relationship between Alvarado or AIR score of 9 or above and whether urgent gynecological pathology was detected (p: 0.073, p: 0.723). It was observed that Alvarado and AIR scores failed to exclude urgent gynecological pathologies."

Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) findings were concerning for a bowel obstruction. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) abdomen and pelvis demonstrated incarcerated small bowel loops into the hepatodiaphragmatic space characteristic of CS and on subsequent laparoscopy adhesions characteristic of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis Syndrome (FHCS) were identified and lysed.

We report a case in which PCI with pneumoperitoneum was incidentally discovered following trauma, revealing an underlying stenosing pyloro-duodenal ulcer. A 60-year-old man was admitted after a road traffic accident. Computed tomography revealed significant pneumoperitoneum without signs of organ injury. Emergency laparotomy showed extensive PCI involving the small bowel, without any perforation. Postoperative esophagogastroduodenoscopy confirmed a markedly dilated stomach and a completely stenosing duodenal ulcer. The patient subsequently underwent antrectomy with gastrojejunostomy and bilateral vagotomy. The postoperative course was uneventful, and histopathology showed no malignancy. PCI may mimic surgical emergencies such as gastrointestinal perforation. In this patient, trauma revealed both PCI and a previously undiagnosed gastric outlet obstruction. The literature supports conservative management in uncomplicated PCI, reserving surgery for complications or when life-threatening conditions cannot be excluded. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge of PCI in trauma. Pneumoperitoneum does not always indicate perforation. A comprehensive diagnostic approach is essential to avoid unnecessary resections and to identify underlying conditions such as peptic ulcer disease."

This study evaluated the impact of HIS.SANSAI on user experiences and health outcomes. A multimethod approach was employed, combining data analysis from a cross-sectional survey that quantified users' preferences and perceptions with an examination of de-identified emergency referral records from 2019 to 2021. Multiple regression analysis assessed whether HIS.SANSAI significantly reduced the duration of medical services, while logistic regression evaluated changes in health outcomes before and after its implementation. The survey results revealed high proficiency in system capabilities. Referring hospitals (sending hospitals) rated the system highest, with a score of 8.00 for \"Reducing coordinated time.\" Referral hospitals (receiving hospitals) expressed moderate satisfaction, scoring highest (7.03) for \"Reducing mistakes in patient information transfer\" and lowest (4.27) for \"Ease of use when recording.\" The effects of HIS.SANSAI were partially supported. Positive outcomes included shorter service times and a 13.16% reduction in severity at emergency room discharge for ischemic stroke patients. However, negative consequences were observed, such as notable treatment delays for acute appendicitis patients. HIS.SANSAI demonstrated robust system capabilities and reduced errors in patient information transfer. Its impact on health outcomes was mixed, with both positive and negative effects. Further evaluation and enhancements are necessary to optimize the system's overall effectiveness."

The case of a patient who underwent a C5-T1 ACDF five years ago was reviewed. A review of past reports of cases of patients who experienced esophageal erosion or perforation following ACDF was conducted. At the age of 69, the patient acutely developed disorientation/agitation and urinary/fecal incontinence. Lab studies showed leukocytosis, an elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), and lactic acidosis, while the EKG confirmed a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with increased troponins. An esophagram revealed esophageal perforation, and a prevertebral C5-C6 abscess, and neck/thoracic CT studies documented 8-9 mm anterior displacement of the right inferior C7 screw with extravasation extending inferiorly into the mediastinum. Surgery consisted of an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, gastric/jejunal tube placement, left neck exploration, and dissection of the esophagus off the anterior instrumentation that was subsequently removed. Despite emergent surgical intervention, the patient expired 5 days postoperatively. Neurosurgical follow-up is warranted in ACDF patients who newly present with findings indicative of with anterior retropharyngeal abscess or esophageal perforation."

She had an IVC filter placed, followed by an IVC stent years later. The patient presented with severe lower back pain radiating to her right leg and back spasms. Investigations revealed an IVC filter tine extruding into the L3-L4 disc space, causing discitis-osteomyelitis, an intraosseous abscess and a psoas abscess. Another tine caused mild hydronephrosis by abutting the ureter. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was cultured from a disc aspirate. After initial antibiotic treatment, her spinal instability worsened, necessitating complex spinal surgery to remove three filter tines. This case highlights the significant risks of IVC filters, including fracture and organ perforation, and emphasises the critical importance of timely filter removal to prevent serious, though sometimes rare, outcomes."

This retrospective cohort study used prospectively collected data from 1 May 2015 to 31 December 2023 at Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University. Among in-patients undergoing emergency general surgery, 2908 patients with OSEs were included. The OSEs were classified into five categories based on the tumor course: (1) emergency as the initial symptom, (2) emergency due to tumor progression or recurrence, (3) complications from non-invasive treatments, (4) complications from invasive treatments, and (5) emergencies unrelated to tumors but with a history of malignancy. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Obstruction was the most common emergency (58.0%), and gastrointestinal tumors were the primary source (79.8%). Category 1 emergencies were the most frequent (42.8%), followed by categories 2 (16.4%), 4 (16.0%), 5 (19.5%), and 3 (5.5%). The patients with OSEs had a higher in-hospital mortality rate than those with other types of emergencies (4.0% vs. 1.5%; p < 0.001). Perforation, age ≥ 65 years, and male sex were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality. The comprehensive five-category classification system for OSEs provided a valuable framework that may enhance clinical decision-making and guide management strategies for this patient population. Thus, it has potential to be integrated into clinical practice."

This study investigated the clinical parameters of patients undergoing emergency surgery for strangulated and non-strangulated bowel obstructions and identified the predictive factors for intestinal ischemia. This retrospective review included 270 patients who underwent surgery for bowel obstruction. The clinical and operative factors were analyzed to determine the predictive factors for intestinal ischemia. A novel predictive scoring system was developed based on significant parameters identified by a multivariate analysis. Among patients with strangulated bowel obstruction, independent predictors for the need for intestinal resection were massive ascites, computed tomography value ≤ 50 Hounsfield units, lactate levels ≥ 30 mg/dL, and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio ≥ 8.5. A novel predictive score was developed using these four parameters. Patients with a score of 0 did not require intestinal resection because of strangulation. Fifteen patients, with a score of 7, developed irreversible ischemia and required intestinal resection. A predictive score incorporating ascites, computed tomography values, lactate levels, and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio effectively stratified patients with strangulated bowel obstruction, aiding early diagnosis and risk stratification."

    "abstract": "Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a rare form of necrotising vasculitis characterised by eosinophilic infiltration and systemic involvement, most commonly affecting the lungs, skin, and peripheral nerves. Gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations are common in patients with EGPA, although histopathological confirmation of GI involvement is infrequent. Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency, but its presentation as an initial manifestation of EGPA is exceptionally uncommon. We report the case of a 54-year-old man with a history of asthma who presented with fever and epigastric pain that later migrated to the right lower quadrant. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein levels. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) demonstrated mild appendiceal enlargement, and a diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made. The patient underwent laparoscopic appendectomy. Postoperatively, he developed persistent lower abdominal pain, new-onset bilateral lower extremity pain, and marked eosinophilia (60%). Histopathological examination of the resected appendix revealed dense eosinophilic infiltration and necrotising vasculitis, establishing the diagnosis of ANCA-negative EGPA. This phenotype is known to present with gastrointestinal manifestations and peripheral eosinophilia frequently. He was subsequently transferred to a specialised centre for further treatment. This case highlights the potential for EGPA to mimic acute appendicitis. When persistent eosinophilia and atypical postoperative symptoms are present, systemic diseases such as EGPA should be considered. Histopathological analysis plays a pivotal role in identifying underlying systemic vasculitis, particularly in cases with unusual clinical presentations. Greater awareness of EGPA as a differential diagnosis in atypical appendicitis may facilitate earlier recognition and timely management."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is the most frequent non-traumatic surgical emergency in children. While laparoscopic surgery is standard, postoperative recovery often involves pain, delayed bowel function, and reduced mobility. Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) may improve recovery by addressing fascial restrictions and visceral dysfunction. This pilot study investigates OMT's effect on postoperative pain and hospital length of stay in pediatric patients undergoing appendectomy. This non-randomized, time-controlled clinical trial was conducted at Meyer Pediatric Hospital (Florence, Italy) with 43 patients aged 5-17 undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy. Participants were divided by appendicitis type (complicated/uncomplicated) and treatment group (OMT vs. control). The OMT group received two standardized sessions within 48 h post-surgery. Primary outcomes included postoperative pain (assessed via Numeric Rating Scale) and hospital stay. Secondary outcomes included bowel function, mobilization, and nausea/vomiting. Data were analyzed using multivariate statistics and t-tests, with p < 0.05 as the significance threshold. The OMT group showed a shorter mean hospital stay (4.6 vs. 7 days) and significantly greater reductions in abdominal and shoulder pain compared to controls. In uncomplicated appendicitis, pain reduction reached 3/10 vs. 1.7/10 in controls; in complicated cases, 3.6/10 vs. 1.8/10. Shoulder pain relief was also more pronounced in the OMT groups. Improvements in bowel function, mobilization, and nausea were observed in both groups, with no statistically significant differences. This pilot study provides preliminary evidence that OMT may enhance postoperative recovery in pediatric appendectomy by reducing pain and potentially shortening hospital stays. Although not statistically significant due to the small sample size, the clinical relevance of these findings supports further investigation through larger, randomized trials."

Patient had an exploratory laparotomy in which adhesiolysis, Ladd's procedure and appendectomy were done. The patient had uneventful postoperative recovery and was discharged after 6 days. Midgut malrotation results from failure of the midgut to rotate around the axis of the superior mesenteric artery. The presentation in adults are usually nonspecific and is low on the differential diagnosis, making enhanced abdominal CT the modality of choice. Midgut volvulus should be considered in cases of unexplained abdominal pain or bowel obstruction, even in adult age group.

However, it is sometimes difficult to precisely assess intestinal blood flow. In recent years, assessment of organ blood flow using indocyanine green fluorescence imaging (ICG-FI) has become increasingly common in laparoscopic surgery. We report two cases of strangulated SBO in which intestinal blood flow was assessed using indocyanine green and treatment was achieved in a minimally invasive manner through a laparoscopic approach. Case 1: A 76-year-old man presented with abdominal pain and was diagnosed with strangulated SBO. We performed emergency laparoscopic surgery and dissected the loop of the band into which the intestine was strangulated. Although the procedure was converted to open surgery, we used ICG-FI to evaluate the intestinal blood flow and decided to preserve the intestines. Case 2: An 86-year-old woman presented with vomiting and was diagnosed with strangulated SBO by using abdominal computed tomography. Emergency laparoscopic surgery was performed, and strangulation was relieved under a pneumoperitoneum. The intestine was preserved because intestinal blood flow was observed on the ICG-FI. In this report, we presented two cases of strangulated SBO in which laparoscopic surgery was initiated and ICG-FI was used intraoperatively. Traditionally, the decision to resect the bowel relies heavily on subjective findings, which can lead to unnecessary resections and postoperative complications. ICG-FI offers a more objective assessment of perfusion and has shown potential in various emergency and elective gastrointestinal procedures. Its intraoperative use can assist in real-time surgical decision-making, even in challenging cases with persistent discoloration after release of strangulation. Moreover, when laparoscopic access is feasible, this approach can enhance visualization, facilitate teamwork, and minimize invasiveness. While laparoscopy may not be appropriate in all cases, particularly in hemodynamically unstable patients or those with severe intestinal dilation, it remains a valuable strategy in selected patients, especially when combined with advanced tools such as ICG-FI. In laparoscopic surgery for strangulated small bowel obstruction, ICG fluorescence imaging can be a valuable tool for assessing intestinal blood flow, which can reduce unnecessary resection of the intestine and enhance patient outcomes in elective cases."

    "abstract": "Postoperative diaphragmatic hernia is an uncommon complication following esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. Once it occurs, emergency surgical intervention is typically required. However, the optimal surgical repair approach remains debatable depending on the specific clinical scenario. Therefore, we aim to investigate the common etiological factors and optimal surgical strategies for post-esophagectomy diaphragmatic hernia, and share our therapeutic experience to provide optimal treatment for patients. A 70-year-old male patient developed sudden chest tightness and retrosternal pain during nocturnal sleep 17 months after radical esophagectomy, accompanied by persistent pain in the left upper abdomen that prevented standing, with nausea (no vomiting), and absence of defecation or flatus. Diaphragmatic hernia, strangulated intestinal obstruction, and esophageal cancer (postoperative status). Emergency transthoracic diaphragmatic hernia repair with partial small bowel resection was performed via thoracic approach. On postoperative day 9, the patient's bowel and urinary functions returned to normal, resumed a semiliquid diet, was discharged after suture removal. Post-esophagectomy diaphragmatic hernia represents a severe complication. Open transthoracic surgery proves to be a safe and effective approach for cases complicated by strangulated intestinal obstruction. However, in cases of diaphragmatic hernia following minimally invasive esophagectomy without preoperative evidence of strangulation, laparoscopic exploration and repair could be considered. Regardless of open or minimally invasive esophagectomy, meticulous operative techniques should be employed to minimize the risk of diaphragmatic hernia formation."

    "abstract": "Foreign body ingestion in children is a medical emergency, with severe cases posing life-threatening risks. Swallowing blades is an extremely rare and critical emergency requiring immediate medical intervention. The blades may cause perforation or bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract at any time, threatening the patient's life. This case report aims to provide treatment process and experience for dealing with this condition. A 14-year-old girl was hospitalized for swallowing 6 blades. Upon hospital admission, an emergency esophagogastroduodenoscopy was immediately performed. One blade was removed under emergency esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and the other 5 blades had entered the intestine and could not be removed endoscopically. After conservative medical treatment, the rest blades remarkably and naturally passed without surgical intervention. And the patient was discharged from the hospital without obvious discomfort. Ingesting blades might lead to serious or fatal complications that require urgent surgical treatment. Strict medical management and timely assessment of the condition are very important for passage of ingested blades, which may avoid surgical procedures. This report provides valuable insights and guidance for clinicians in the management of patients with swallowing blades."

    "abstract": "Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a widely utilized and effective procedure in metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS). Stapler line leakage is one of the most catastrophic complications of LSG. Although there are various available treatment options for refractory leakage, there is currently no standardized protocol. In this case report, we present a treatment option for a chronic gastric fistula following LSG, performed as a salvage treatment after the failure of several conservative management techniques. We also reviewed the literature to contextualize our case within the spectrum of treatment strategies for refractory fistulas. A 45-year-old woman underwent LSG 7 days prior to presentation. The patient presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and fever. She was diagnosed with a gastric leak following LSG. The patient underwent an emergency surgery for generalized peritonitis and hemodynamic instability, during which multiple drains were placed in the abdomen. Furthermore, the patient was managed conservatively, including endoscopic vacuum therapy for 3 months. The leakage persisted despite these interventions. Complete total gastrectomy was performed 3 months later, and the patient was discharged 27 days after the surgery. If conservative treatments fail to resolve leakage, delayed total gastrectomy should be considered as a definitive treatment option for refractory leaks."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal perforation peritonitis is a life-threatening surgical emergency with high mortality. Early identification of patients at increased risk of poor outcomes is critical for optimizing care. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of combining serial Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores and serial serum lactate levels in predicting 30-day postoperative mortality among patients undergoing emergency laparotomy for gastrointestinal perforation peritonitis. In this prospective cohort study, 120 adult patients diagnosed with gastrointestinal perforation peritonitis and undergoing emergency laparotomy were enrolled after obtaining ethical approval and informed consent. APACHE II scores and serum lactate levels were recorded at three time points: preoperatively (baseline), 6 h postoperatively, and 24 h postoperatively. The primary objective of this study was a combination of serial APACHE II and serial serum lactate level (baseline, 6 h and 24 h post-operatively) and its correlation with post-operative mortality in emergency laparotomy for hollow viscus perforation peritonitis. Data were analysed to compare clinical variables between survivors and non-survivors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) analyses were used to assess the predictive performance of individual and combined markers. The 30-day postoperative mortality rate was 35%. Significant differences in age, serial APACHE II scores, and serial serum lactate levels were observed between survivors and non-survivors. A serum lactate level of ≥ 1.88 mmol/L had a sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 69.2% (AUC: 0.817; p = 0.0001). APACHE II scores of ≥ 11.16 yielded a sensitivity of 76.2% and specificity of 91% (AUC: 0.915; p = 0.0001). Both serial lactate levels and APACHE II scores were independent predictors of 30-day mortality. The combination of serial APACHE II scores and serum lactate (cutoff ≥ 11.95) had a sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 82%, and an AUC of 0.919 (p = 0.0001), making it the preferred predictor for 30-day post-operative mortality. The combination of serial APACHE II scores and serial serum lactate levels provides superior prognostic accuracy for predicting 30-day postoperative mortality in patients undergoing emergency laparotomy for gastrointestinal perforation peritonitis. This approach may facilitate early identification of high-risk patients and guide clinical decision-making. Not applicable."

    "abstract": "The radiographic diagnosis of internal hernia following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) can be difficult. Here, we sought to improve the detection of internal hernias through the implementation of a structured CT reporting tool. This is a single-institution, retrospective cohort study of RYGB patients presenting to the Emergency Department. In 2023, an educational seminar and a structured CT tool were both implemented to incorporate the signs of internal hernia into CT reads. The tool incorporates the following: Antecolic/retrocolic Roux limb, jejunojejunostomy sidedness, abnormalities of the superior mesenteric vein, presence of mesenteric swirl or mesenteric edema, small bowel obstruction, small bowel clustering, bowel loops located posterior to the Roux limb mesentery, any significant changes in bowel loop configuration from prior CT scans, and a final impression of the presence or absence of internal hernia. A Pre-Intervention period of 1 year was used to compare CT scans 1 year after the implementation. During the Pre-Intervention period, 139 CT scans were obtained. Five (3.0%) radiographic diagnoses of internal hernia were made, four of which underwent operative reduction. Six internal hernias (3.7%) were missed by CT. All six required surgical reduction, with one experiencing entire small bowel necrosis resulting in resection and small bowel transplantation. During the Post-Intervention period, 49.7% of the 193 CT scans included the structured CT reporting tool. Eight (3.7%) radiographic diagnoses of internal hernia were made, six of which underwent operative reduction. Two diagnoses of internal hernia were missed on CT scan (1.1%). The sensitivity for internal hernia detection in the Pre- and Post-Intervention groups was 40.0 vs. 75.0% (p = 0.14), and the specificity was 99.2 vs. 98.9%, respectively (p = 0.79). Implementing a structured tool for the detection of internal hernias with CT scans may improve the diagnosis rates of internal hernia among those who have undergone RYGB."

    "abstract": "Coronary perforation during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a rare yet life-threatening complication, often necessitating emergent pericardiocentesis. However, rarely unexpected complications such as vascular injuries may arise, further complicating the clinical course. A 76-year-old lady with progressive angina underwent PCI for significant stenoses in the left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCX) artery. The procedure was complicated by a coronary perforation in the mid-LAD, leading to cardiac tamponade. Emergent pericardiocentesis via the subxiphoid approach, guided by echocardiography, drained 300 mL of blood and temporarily stabilized the patient. A covered stent was deployed to seal the LAD perforation, but persistent bleeding suggested a secondary complication. Diagnostic evaluation, including analysis of the pericardial aspirate and repeat angiography, identified an arterial source of bleeding unrelated to the coronary perforation. Exploratory sternotomy revealed an aberrant superior epigastric artery injured during pericardiocentesis. Surgical ligation of the artery resulted in immediate hemodynamic improvement, and the patient was discharged in stable condition after a full recovery. This case highlights a rare vascular complication of pericardiocentesis, specifically an injury to the superior epigastric artery, exacerbated by anatomical variation. Such unreported injuries in the literature underscore the unpredictability of rare vascular complications even in typically safer techniques like the subxiphoid approach. A systematic, stepwise approach-combining imaging guidance, diagnostic evaluations, and prompt surgical intervention-is essential for timely management. Early recognition of vascular injury and swift multidisciplinary collaboration ensured a favorable outcome in this case, emphasizing the importance of vigilance and structured decision-making when complications arise."

    "abstract": "Trocar site hernia is a recognized but often underreported complication of minimally invasive surgery, including robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy. While relatively rare, trocar site hernia can lead to severe complications such as bowel obstruction, strangulation, and the need for emergency surgical intervention. Trocar size has been identified as a primary risk factor, with hernias occurring predominantly at sites where 10 mm or larger trocars are used. However, the role of fascial closure is still debated. A systematic literature review (1992-2022) identified 21 cases of trocar site hernia in 13 studies. Only 8 papers provided data on the total number of RaRP procedures which were associated to the reported cases of TSH, with 15 cases of TSH identified out of 3,418 RaRP procedures. Statistical analyses were conducted to assess significant risk factors and potential prevention strategies. Specifically, of the 19 cases in which trocar size was explicitly reported, 15 hernias were associated with 12 mm trocars and 4 with 8 mm trocars (p<0.001). Fascial closure was not performed in all reported cases involving 12 mm trocars. No significant correlations were found between trocar site hernia incidence and patient-related factors such as age, body mass index, or prior hernias. Additionally, we report a case of trocar site hernia following RARP in a 67-year-old male with a BMI of 33.46 and a history of prior abdominal hernioplasty. The patient developed bowel obstruction on postoperative day 4 due to a hernia at a 12 mm trocar site, requiring emergency laparotomy and bowel resection with end-to-end anastomosis. Given the strong association between TSH and 12 mm trocars, we suggest routine fascial closure at these sites to reduce the risk of postoperative complications. Further studies are necessary to confirm these findings. Additionally, other potential risk factors and mechanisms contributing to trocar site hernia development in patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy should be investigated."

Research about non-traumatic abdominal pain is limited in Rwanda and East Africa. This study aims to understand the clinical profile and outcomes of non-traumatic abdominal pain at the largest tertiary hospital in Rwanda. A prospective cohort study of patients presenting with non-traumatic abdominal pain was undertaken. During the 5-month study, two hundred sixty-one patients were enrolled in the study. The mean age was 39.7 years and male patients accounted for 57.5 % of the cohort. Nearly half of the cohort were triaged as a high priority (11.1 % red, 31.8 % orange), and 42.9 % were hemodynamically unstable at or shortly after presentation. More than half of the patients (57 %) had surgical conditions, including 40.2 % who underwent surgery and 17.6 % who were treated conservatively. The most common diagnoses were intestinal obstruction (25.7 % of all cases) and hollow viscus perforation (18.8 %). Mortality was 11.1 %, and the mean hospital length of stay was 9.1 days. Predicting factors for death outcome (p-value<0.05) were advanced age, altered mental status, jaundice at presentation, peritonitis, known malignancy, and acute kidney injury. Abdominal pain is a common presenting problem, accounting for approximately 1 in 10 patients presenting to a tertiary care centre in Rwanda, with 2 in 5 patients requiring operative interventions.

We describe the case of a 78-year-old male with de novo high-grade urothelial carcinoma, presenting with persistent gross hematuria, bilateral hydronephrosis, and severe anemia. Despite initial tumor resection and nephrostomy placement, the patient's condition deteriorated with signs of peritoneal irritation and systemic inflammation. Emergency cystoprostatectomy revealed extensive tumor necrosis and inflammatory peritoneal fluid, but no macroscopic bladder perforation. Histopathology confirmed muscle-invasive high-grade urothelial carcinoma (pT2b) with necrosis and angioinvasion. This report illustrates a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in the management of advanced bladder cancer complicated by suspected sterile chemical peritonitis, emphasizing the importance of early source control in critically ill patients."

We report the case of a male neonate born at 33 weeks of gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery, with a birth weight of 1,780 grams. The initial postnatal adaptation was satisfactory. However, on the second day of life, the infant developed sudden and severe abdominal distension associated with bilious vomiting and signs of respiratory distress. A plain abdominal radiograph revealed a massive pneumoperitoneum, highly suggestive of gastrointestinal perforation. The neonate underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy, which revealed a 2 cm linear perforation on the anterior wall of the stomach. The perforation was repaired primarily without the need for gastric resection. Despite early surgical intervention and aggressive postoperative management in a neonatal intensive care unit, the infant's condition deteriorated rapidly. He developed signs of sepsis, refractory shock, and multiorgan failure, and succumbed within 48 hours postoperatively. This case underscores the fulminant course and high mortality rate associated with SGP, especially in preterm neonates. It highlights the critical importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion in the presence of acute abdominal symptoms and radiologic findings, as early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention are essential for improving outcomes in these vulnerable patients."

    "abstract": "Anastomotic leakage still represents the most feared complication in colorectal surgery. However, there is limited data focusing on management and how this affects outcome in case of leakage following open versus laparoscopic right colectomy. We, therefore, performed an observational multicenter study addressing this issue. Data of patients undergoing elective right colectomy for benign and malignant disease using an open or laparoscopic approach were collected in seven colorectal units among Austria between January 2010 and December 2019. Patients undergoing emergency surgery or suffering from Crohn's disease with chronic anastomotic fistula were excluded. Demographic, peri- and postoperative data were analyzed retrospectively. During the study, a total of 3446 patients were operated on using an open (n = 2282, 66.2%) or laparoscopic (n = 1164, 33.8%) approach. Anastomotic leak rates accounted for 2.8% (65/2281) and 3.2% (37/1165), respectively (p = .588). Age at operation (p < .001), initial surgical approach (open versus laparoscopic; p = .034) and the Mannheim Peritonitis Index (MPI; p < .001) at revision represented independent risk factors for mortality. We divided the surgical strategy during revision into three subgroups: suturing of leak (SD), formation of new anastomosis (NA) or fecal diversion with or without formation of new anastomosis (FD). SD, NA or FD had no influence on clinical outcome and mortality (p = .599). The initial approach had no influence on which strategy was used later, but time to revision was significantly shorter following initial laparoscopic resection (6.2 versus 8.8 days, p = .008). Leak-associated mortality was lower in the minimally invasive group (8.1% vs 23.1%; p = .057). Timing of revision and not the surgical strategy (± fecal diversion) has an impact on the clinical outcome of patients with a leak following right colectomy. An initial laparoscopic approach may lead to an earlier revision resulting in a lower mortality rate."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in children with approximately 30 % of patients presenting with perforation, defined as a hole in the appendix or a fecalith found in the abdomen, at time of surgery. Our previous protocol at time of discharge, with an 8 % intra-abdominal abscess (IAA) rate, included checking a white blood cell count (WBC) on day of discharge, with a value ≥ 10 serving as a trigger for additional outpatient oral antibiotics course. Beginning in May, 2023 we changed our protocol to no longer obtain WBC count or prescribe outpatient antibiotics at time of discharge. The purpose of this study is to determine if the post-discharge IAA rate of patients with perforated appendicitis was impacted with no antibiotics at discharge. A prospective observational study of patients <18 years old who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for perforated appendicitis between May 1, 2023-May 1, 2024 at a single institution was completed. Patients were treated with antibiotics while inpatient and then discharged without antibiotics once appropriate discharge criteria were met (pain controlled, afebrile ≥12 h, and tolerating regular diet). A total of 202 patients were managed for perforated appendicitis since the protocol change. The median LOS for the entire cohort was 3.02 days (IQR 2.11, 4.21). 9.9 % of patients (N = 20) developed IAA after discharge, 15 (7 %) of which were readmitted. Median LOS for these patients was 2.81 days (2.49, 3.32) compared to median LOS of 3.03 days (2.12, 4.22) (p = 0.65). Eight patients (4 %) underwent percutaneous drainage with interventional radiology (IR). Patients who developed IAA after discharge had longer operative times (52 min vs 40 min, p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in age, BMI, LOS, antibiotic duration, or presenting symptoms for patients that developed IAA compared to those that did not develop IAA. Under the context of a one-tailed non-inferiority study with a non-inferiority margin of 12 % and our given sample size for the two groups (power = 0.801, alpha = 0.025), the difference in post-operative IAA rates between the two groups is 2 % (95 % CI: -2 %-7 %), concluding that withholding antibiotics at discharge is non-inferior. Omission of outpatient antibiotics and pre-discharge laboratory testing did not result in a significant change in post-operative IAA rate after discharge. IV, Prospective observational study."

A retrospective review of patients who underwent appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2023 was conducted. Pathology reports and perioperative outcomes were analyzed. Among 5341 patients, 1.1 % had notable alternative pathologies including 31 occult malignancies (0.6 %) and 24 atypical infections (0.5 %). A subgroup analysis demonstrated that patients who underwent interval appendectomy were more likely to have neoplasms (5/128) than those who underwent uncomplicated acute appendectomies (3.9 % vs 0.6 %, respectively; p < 0.001). The median postoperative length of stay was 2.6 h (IQR 2.0-12.5 h). There were 182 (3.4 %) surgery-related emergency center visits post-discharge and 57 (1.1 %) surgery-related readmissions. Seventeen patients (0.3 %) required additional procedures. The negative appendectomy rate was 1.8 %. A notable number of patients had alternative diagnoses made by pathologic examination, including occult malignancies and atypical infections which required further treatment. The perioperative outcomes of appendectomy were favorable, with low morbidity and a low rate of negative appendectomy. These findings underscore the diagnostic value of surgical specimen evaluation and quantify the added risk of missing alternate pathologies when offering non-operative management."

This study aims to describe current diagnostic and treatment practices for acute appendicitis in pregnancy in the UK, and associated outcomes, to identify variations in practice and areas for improvement. This is a UK-wide observational study. Hospitals providing an emergency general surgical service will be eligible to participate. The study consists of two components: (1) a site resource-profile questionnaire to assess the setup of services to care for the pregnant patient requiring emergency non-obstetric abdominal surgery to be completed by a senior collaborator at each participating site, and (2) a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with appendicitis or who had an appendicectomy for suspected appendicitis during a ten-year study period (2013-2023). Data will be collected on diagnostics, radiological findings, management approach and surgical and obstetric outcomes. The main measure of interest is the management approaches (operative versus non-operative; laparoscopic versus open surgery) and their association with selected outcomes. Multivariable logistic regression analyses will be conducted to identify factors which might predict the management strategy and outcomes. The protocol for this service evaluation study has been reviewed by the University of Sheffield Research Ethics Committee. The study findings will be discussed in a multistakeholder workshop consisting of general surgeons, obstetricians and gynaecologists, radiologists, anaesthetists and patient representatives with a view to making recommendations for quality improvement work and further research.

Ongoing abdominal distension and failed conservative management prompted plain radiographs showing dilated small-bowel loops and air-fluid levels. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging revealed a periappendiceal abscess compressing the distal ileum at a transition point. Urgent laparoscopy, converted to a minilaparotomy, confirmed a perforated appendix with dense adhesions tethering the ileum, necessitating appendectomy, adhesiolysis, and peritoneal lavage. The patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful, with normalization of inflammatory markers and restoration of bowel function. This case highlights the importance of considering atypical appendicitis in prolonged gastrointestinal symptoms, the utility of magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosis, and the need for prompt surgical intervention to prevent serious complications."

Two groups of patients were considered based on their surgical (non-complicated/complicated appendicitis) or pathological diagnosis (non-perforated/perforated appendicitis). Factor analysis was carried out to identify communalities to put forward classificatory indices. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the accuracy of the predictions. Results: The cohort included 246 patients (51.6% male, mean age: 24.79 ± 19.32 years). By using their biochemical data, we generated 6 new indices whose areas under the ROC curve (AUC) ranged between 0.632 and 0.762 for complicated appendicitis and from 0.597 to 0.742 for perforated appendicitis. Inflammatory Metabolic Index (IMI) at the fixed cutoffs was a promising biomarker for both histopathological and surgical diagnoses with odds ratios (OR) of 10.45 and 5.21, respectively. The Metabolic-Inflammatory Stress Index (MISI) showed high specificity (over 72%) and significant AUC values for both diagnoses (0.742 and 0.676). These findings were reinforced by significant p-values and Youden indices. Conclusions: IMI and MISI were demonstrated to be effective biomarkers for complicated and perforated appendicitis. IMI provides predictive capability, while MISI offers specificity and significant AUC values for both histopathological and surgical diagnoses. Incorporating these biomarkers could enhance the accuracy of appendicitis diagnosis and potentially guide clinical decision-making."

    "abstract": "Copeptin has shown to correlate with acute appendicitis (AA) in adults. Its usefulness in the diagnosis of paediatric patients with suspected AA is unknown. The purpose of this study is to analyse the role of copeptin in the diagnosis of AA in children and to compare its diagnostic utility with other biomarkers. A prospective, observational, analytical, single-centre study was conducted in a Paediatric Emergency Department (PED) between June 2023 and May 2024. We included patients under 16 years presenting at the PED with acute abdominal pain (AAP) and clinical suspicion of AA after initial medical assessment. Patients with abdominal pain > 7 days were excluded. AA was defined as having a clinical diagnosis confirmed by histopathological examination. The diagnostic performance of copeptin and other biomarkers was analysed using ROC curves. Cut-off points were established according to the Youden index, and their usefulness was compared by sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV). We report results from 246 patients [mean age 10.43 years (SD: 3.13)], of whom 60 (24.39%) had AA. The median copeptin level was 8.70 pmol/L (RIC 5.20-17.50), among patients with AA 15.20 pmol/L (RIC 7.40-31.70) and without AA 7.70 pmol/L (RIC 4.80-12.90) (p < 0.001). The area under the curve was 0.69 (95%CI: 0.61-0.77) for copeptin, 0.84 (95%CI: 0.79-0.89) for leukocytes, 0.84 (95%CI: 0.79-0.89) for neutrophils, and 0.70 (95%CI: 0.63-0.77) for C-reactive protein (CRP). The combination of biomarkers that showed the best diagnostic performance was leukocytes + CRP (sensitivity 96.67%, specificity 51.61%, PPV 39.19%, and NPV 97.96%). Copeptin in association with other biomarkers (leukocytosis and neutrophilia) could be useful to rule out AA. • To date, none of the existing inflammatory biomarkers or their combinations have demonstrated consistent predictive value for the early diagnosis of acute appendicitis (AA) in paediatric population. • In recent years, studies in adults have examined various inflammatory molecules such as copeptin. Elevated copeptin levels have been associated with disease severity and mortality in different conditions. • Isolated copeptin values have limited utility as a biomarker for paediatric AA compared to existing biomarkers. • However, when combined with other biomarkers such as leukocytes or neutrophils, copeptin may help rule out AA."

    "abstract": "Cecal volvulus is a rare cause of acute abdomen, accounting for 1%-3% of intestinal obstructions, and is seldom associated with intestinal nonrotation. Early diagnosis is crucial for improving outcomes, as shown in the case of a 53-year-old male with a 24-hour history of constipation, bloating, colicky pain, and bilious vomiting. He exhibited signs of severe illness, including tachycardia, fever, and abdominal distention, with blood tests showing acute inflammation. After stabilization, an emergency laparotomy revealed a necrotic, 360°-twisted cecum and abnormal intestinal positioning. The patient underwent a right colectomy with appendectomy and ileostomy, recovering uneventfully and later having the stoma reversed. Though nonrotation is usually asymptomatic in adults, it can lead to life-threatening complications like volvulus, requiring surgical intervention. This case highlights the importance of recognizing embryologic abnormalities in adults with acute abdominal symptoms to prevent severe outcomes and underscores the need for prompt surgical treatment in cecal volvulus."

    "abstract": "Small intestinal ulcers are occasionally observed in daily medical practice, and although diagnostic abilities have improved in recent years and the disease pathogenesis has been elucidated, recurrence remains common, requiring proper therapeutic intervention. Herein, we report two cases of small intestine ulceration in young patients who did not experience recurrence for a long period of time after appropriate treatment at disease onset. Case 1 was of a 34-year-old woman who had been taking diclofenac sodium. She was diagnosed with intestinal obstruction through abdominal computed tomography (CT). The patient underwent partial resection of the obstructed ileum. Histopathological examination revealed fibrosis in the submucosa, leading to a diagnosis of stenosis secondary to drug-induced small intestinal ulceration caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Postoperatively, the NSAIDs were changed to a selective COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib). Case 2 was of a 33-year-old man who underwent emergency surgery after an abdominal CT revealed free air. A perforation was found in the small intestine, and the area was resected. Histopathological examination revealed only nonspecific inflammatory findings, leading to a diagnosis of perforation due to a simple small intestinal ulcer. No recurrence was observed in 10 years in both cases. Thus, appropriate management of simple, nonmalignant small intestinal ulcers at initial presentation could be the only treatment needed, with long postoperative recurrence-free periods. These cases demonstrated that proper management of simple, nonmalignant small intestinal ulcers at the initial presentation can be the only treatment needed for long postoperative recurrence-free periods. With an aging society and improved diagnostic capabilities, small intestinal ulcers may become more common in the future. Therefore, the possibility of small intestinal ulceration should be considered when diagnosing ulcerative lesions of the gastrointestinal tract, such as acute abdomen."

    "abstract": "The use of mesh has become standard practice for hernia repair as it facilitates a tension-free closure of the fascial defect and significantly reduces recurrence rates. However, rare but significant complications such as mesh migration can lead to intestinal obstruction, perforation, or enterocutaneous fistula. We present a case of transmural mesh migration from the abdominal wall into the small bowel, resulting in small bowel obstruction and intra-abdominal sepsis. A 66-year-old female patient with a history of umbilical hernia repair with mesh 10 years prior presented with worsening periumbilical bulge, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and progressive erythema. She was hypotensive and tachycardic on arrival, requiring active resuscitation. Computed tomography (CT) imaging showed a 5 x 3 x 3 cm air and fluid collection and abnormal subjacent small bowel. Emergent laparotomy revealed mesh erosion into the small bowel, causing perforation and obstruction. Although mesh migration is rare, its consequences can be life-threatening. Surgeons should maintain a high index of suspicion in patients with prior mesh repair who present with signs of obstruction or sepsis."

Uncommonly, it can also result in the formation of a mycotic aortic pseudoaneurysm. In this report, we describe a 9-month-old girl who presented with an esophageal perforation following ingestion of a pin. She developed life-threatening mediastinitis with a mycotic aortic pseudoaneurysm in the aortic arch that required urgent surgical repair, which involved evacuation of infected mediastinal hematoma, resection of the mycotic aortic pseudoaneurysm, and reconstruction of the aortic arch. The patient did well after surgery and was discharged home in satisfactory condition. The case highlights the importance of early diagnosis, prompt intervention, and antibiotic therapy in esophageal perforation with suspected mediastinitis.

    "abstract": "Infectious complications at the surgical site complicates 1-4% of cesarean deliveries. Strict aseptic technique, hand hygiene and the use of sterile surgical gloves are essential to reduce the risk of surgical site contamination. Glove perforations are observed in almost 30% of all procedures and represent an underestimated potential risk factor for postoperative infections. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate glove perforation rates in cesarean deliveries and to analyze the impact of unrecognized glove perforations during surgery on surgical site infection rates after cesarean delivery. Surgical gloves from cesarean section were collected prospectively. All gloves were inspected for perforation holes. Cases in which surgical gloves had visible (macro) perforations were excluded from the study. Remaining gloves were examined using a water-fill test. Gloves with a positive water filling test were defined as the study group and negative gloves as the control group. Superficial Surgical Site Infections (SSI) were analyzed for the groups. A total of 1,779 pairs of used surgical gloves were collected and examined for perforations across 593 cesarean operations. Macro perforation were observed in 56 (9.4%) operations. The remaining 1,611 pairs of gloves underwent water-fill testing. Of these, 505 operations had completely intact gloves, while in 32 (5.4%) cases, micro-perforations were identified. SSI occurred in 18 women (3.3%): 7 in the perforation group (21.8%) and 11 in the control group (2.2%) (p < 0.001). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, glove micro-perforation was found to be a significant independent predictor of SSI (adjusted odds ratio: 12.705; 95% CI: 4.244-38.039; p < 0.001), even after adjusting for potential confounders including diabetes, obesity, emergency cesarean, operative duration, and intraoperative blood loss. Our data show that glove perforation is unexpectedly common and underestimated in terms of unfavorable surgical outcomes. The rate of surgical site infections is increasing and we suggest that unrecognized glove perforation must be considered as a risk factor for surgical site infection after cesarean section."

    "abstract": "Emergency laparotomy is performed for a wide range of life-threatening conditions and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Risk prediction models facilitate accurate communication of operative risk with patients and relatives, in addition to benchmarking unit outcomes. Greater understanding of the impact of sarcopenia or myosteatosis will encourage the adoption of routine radiological reporting of body composition and the incorporation of skeletal muscle gauge (SMG) into risk prediction models. This study investigated the prognostic significance of SMG, an aggregate assessment of sarcopenia or myosteatosis, in patients who had undergone an emergency non-trauma-related laparotomy. This was a retrospective cohort study of patients aged ≥ 18 years who underwent an emergency laparotomy at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital between January 2014 and December 2020. Body composition and patient outcomes were analysed. In all, 1090 patients with a mean(standard deviation) age of 62.3(17.5) years underwent emergency laparotomy (bowel obstruction, 52.7%; perforation, 26.3%; ischaemia, 9.5%). Overall 30- and 90-day mortality was 10.0% and 11.6%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, low SMG was associated with worse 30- and 90-day mortality, with odds ratios of 2.12 (95% confidence interval (c.i.) 1.18 to 3.83; P = 0.012) and 2.64 (95% c.i. 1.55 to 4.48; P < 0.001), respectively. Low SMG was also associated with an increased length of hospital stay (odds ratio 1.45; 95% c.i. 1.22 to 1.72; P < 0.001). A low SMG was associated with increased postoperative mortality and length of hospital stay after emergency laparotomy. Patients undergoing computed tomography imaging for acute abdominal pain should undergo routine reporting of body composition."

    "abstract": "The Austrian syndrome is a rare but malignant triad consisting of pneumonia, meningitis, and endocarditis caused by an invasive pneumococcal infection, with a mortality rate of approximately 32%, rising to over 60% if not diagnosed early. Most of the knowledge about this rare disease comes from case reports. The uniqueness of this case lies in the late presentation of endocarditis. A 59-year-old woman with a medical history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, hypothyroidism, and mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis was admitted to our hospital with meningitis and pneumonia with bacteremia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. After receiving antibiotic treatment, the patient improved, and an echocardiogram was performed, ruling out endocarditis. She was discharged and readmitted three weeks later due to endocarditis with an acute perforation of the aortic valve, which required urgent surgery. Fortunately, the patient survived. In cases of invasive pneumococcal disease with involvement of more than one focus, the possibility of developing infective endocarditis should be considered, especially in cases of hemodynamic instability or heart failure. The Austrian syndrome is a triad that should not be overlooked due to its high mortality rate, especially the possibility of the late onset of endocarditis."

    "abstract": "Internal hernias represent an uncommon etiology of small bowel obstruction (SBO). Among these, herniation through a defect in the broad ligament is one of the least common types. Because symptoms are vague and imaging findings are often minimal, these presentations can be easily overlooked and may progress to bowel ischemia or gangrene. A 47-year-old multiparous woman with no history of abdominal surgery presented to the emergency department with severe, worsening abdominal pain that developed over the past 12 hours. Ultrasound was the only imaging modality available. It detected free fluid in the abdomen but did not identify a specific organ abnormality. The clinical team initially proceeded with an open appendicectomy, which was subsequently converted to an exploratory laparotomy. During the procedure, they identified an internal hernia that had passed through a defect in the left broad ligament. Approximately 25 cm of the necrotic bowel was resected, and the remaining segments were joined with a primary anastomosis. Postoperatively, the patient recovered without incident and was discharged home once her bowel function resumed. While broad ligament hernias are exceedingly rare, they should be kept in mind as a possible explanation for obstruction in females who have not undergone pelvic surgery. Preoperative diagnosis is frequently missed because of subtle imaging clues and the infrequency of the disease in everyday practice. When advanced radiology is limited or inconclusive, surgical exploration remains the most reliable route to both identify the problem and provide timely treatment. Although rare, broad ligament hernias should be considered in female patients presenting with SBO and no prior abdominal operations. Prompt recognition and surgical intervention are vital to minimize morbidity and mortality."

The objective of this study was to assess prospectively the predictive value of three of these scores (the CONUT score, the PNI, and the NRI) for short term outcomes following emergency abdominal surgery. This is a prospective cohort study that was conducted over a period of 13 months. It was approved by the local ethical committee and included 150 patients who underwent emergency major abdominal surgeries and agreed to participate in the study. All patients included were clinically assessed and underwent laboratory and radiological investigations based on their presentation. Data required to calculate the three nutritional indices were collected. Patients underwent their specific surgery and received postoperative care in either the surgical ICU or surgical ward according to standard protocols based on the type of surgery. Males comprised 64.70% of the study populations with a mean age of 48.48 ± 15.80 years and a mean BMI of 29.55 ± 4.99 kg/m2. The preoperative diagnosis was peritonitis due to various etiologies in 50.7% of patients, while 21.3% were diagnosed with intestinal obstruction. According to the CONUT score, the preoperative nutritional status was normal in 43.3% of patients. mild malnutrition in 46%, moderate malnutrition in 10.7%, and no patients with severe malnutrition. The PNI values ranged from 32.4 to 59.5 with a mean of 46.76 ± 6.55 while the NRI values ranged from 33.8 to 49.9 with a mean of 46.94 ± 1.90. The NRI had the highest diagnostic accuracy at 73%, followed by the CONUT score at 68%, and lastly the PNI at 66%. The three nutritional assessment scores were significant predictors of postoperative complications in emergency abdominal surgery, with the NRI showing the highest diagnostic accuracy."

    "abstract": "Uncontrolled deep arterial bleeding and perforated wounds in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract present significant clinical challenges, especially in emergency settings. In this study, a multifunctional polymeric aerogel (CPP), composed of carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS), poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA), and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), is developed to address the dual needs of rapid hemostasis and infection prevention. The CPP aerogel exhibits excellent swelling behavior, enabling rapid blood absorption and mechanical expansion to establish a physical barrier. Thrombin incorporation significantly accelerates the coagulation cascade, achieving a blood clotting index of 4.94 ± 1.06% in vitro (150 s). In a rabbit model of gastric perforation, thrombin-loaded CPP aerogel reduces hemostasis time to 52.33 ± 11.06 s and minimizes blood loss to 280.54 ± 40.18 mg. Furthermore, loading the aerogel with Maxpower biological antibacterial liquid (Maxpower) enhances antimicrobial efficacy against both Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli), surpassing the performance of the antibacterial solution alone. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the CPP and its drug-loaded aerogels serve as a robust, synergistic platform combining mechanical sealing, biochemical hemostasis, and localized antimicrobial protection, with high potential for clinical translation in GI trauma and surgical applications."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency, with a lifetime risk of 8.6% in men and 6.7% in women. The standard of care is appendectomy, which can be performed using a single-incision laparoscopic approach. The evidence on single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy (SILA) is predominantly based on randomized controlled trials, often excluding patients with comorbidities or complex clinical profiles. This study aimed to generate real-world data (RWD) on adult patients undergoing SILA to assess its safety, feasibility, and clinical outcomes in routine practice. In addition, the study aimed to identify patient-specific risk factors for intraoperative and postoperative complications. Data were obtained from the prospective multicenter SILAP registry, which included adult patients (≥18 years) who underwent SILA between January 2012 and April 2016. Demographic and clinical data including perioperative outcomes, were collected. Inclusion criteria comprised the ability and willingness to provide informed consent, while exclusion criteria included participation in other interventional studies. A descriptive comparison with high-volume studies was performed, focusing on key perioperative outcomes, including complication rates, operative time, length of hospital stay, mortality, and conversion rate. A total of 276 patients from 14 different hospitals in Germany who underwent SILA were included. The mean operative time was 50.9 minutes (standard deviation [SD] ± 27.6). The average postoperative length of stay was 3.6 days (SD ± 4.3), and the mortality rate was 0%. Intraoperative complications occurred in 1.8%, while 6.2% had postoperative complications. No significant associations were found between sex, age, body mass index, and American Society of Anesthesiologists classification and perioperative complications. In 96.4% of cases, the appendectomy was successfully completed using the single-incision technique. SILA demonstrates safety and feasibility for managing acute appendicitis in routine clinical practice. The RWD supports outcomes of clinical trials. Further validation is required to confirm risk factors for complication of specific subgroups."

    "abstract": "Adult intussusception is rare, occurring in only 1 out of 1300 (0.08%) abdominal surgeries and accounting <1% of adult intestinal obstruction cases. The overall incidence of adult intussusception is 1-3 cases per 100 000 population and comprises 5% of all intussusception cases. Idiopathic ileocecal colic intussusception in adults is exceptionally rare, making our case a unique and noteworthy contribution to the existing literature. A 23-year-old male presented with abdominal pain for 2 weeks, associated with vomiting and black-colored stool. On examination, mild tenderness and a palpable mass were noted over the right lumbar region. Ultrasonography and Contrast Enhanced Computed Tomography (CECT) of the abdomen and pelvis revealed features of ileocecal colic intussusception. An emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed, with reduction of the intussusceptum using the Hutchinson maneuver, followed by a limited right hemicolectomy. Although intussusception is the most common cause of bowel obstruction in children aged ≤5 years, it is rare in adults. When it does occur in adults, >90% of cases are associated with an identifiable lead point, with only a few cases being idiopathic. The most commonly reported types of intussusception in adults are colocolic and enteric, followed by ileocolic and ileocecal types. Acute intestinal obstruction is not the typical presentation of adult intussusception; rather, the majority of cases present with subacute or chronic symptoms. History of recurrent intermittent partial bowel obstruction over days to years may suggest intussusception. Early diagnosis and timely intervention can significantly reduce patient morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "Foreign body ingestion, particularly fish bones, is a well-known cause of gastrointestinal perforation. If not promptly diagnosed, it can lead to severe complications, including life-threatening situations. Timely recognition and intervention are crucial to prevent adverse outcomes. A 33-year-old male presented with abdominal pain, nausea, and cessation of gas and stool. Clinical evaluation and abdominal X-ray suggested intestinal obstruction, and the patient denied any history of foreign body ingestion. However, physical examination revealed significant peritoneal irritation. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) subsequently identified a retained foreign body at the terminal ileum, raising suspicion of intestinal perforation. Upon further inquiry, the patient recalled consuming fish with bones before symptom onset and participating in ball sports prior to the exacerbation of abdominal pain. Emergency laparoscopic surgery confirmed intestinal perforation caused by a fish bone. The bone was successfully removed, and the perforation was repaired. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on postoperative day 7. Early diagnosis using CT imaging is essential in identifying bowel perforation caused by foreign bodies. In this case, the patient's history of recent fish consumption, along with clinical findings and imaging, guided the correct diagnosis and successful management. This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis and CT imaging in detecting foreign body-induced bowel perforation. For patients presenting with intestinal obstruction but lacking typical signs such as free air, special attention should be given to thoroughly inquiring about the history of foreign body ingestion to avoid delayed diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Jejunal diverticulosis is an uncommon condition, and its complications-such as perforation-pose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, particularly in elderly patients. Contained perforation is especially difficult to identify due to its non-specific clinical presentation and subtle radiological findings. We report the case of an 82-year-old woman with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and irritable bowel syndrome. She presented to the emergency department with a two-day history of diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Physical examination revealed abdominal distension and tenderness in the epigastric and mesogastric regions, without signs of peritoneal irritation. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis and impaired renal and hepatic function. Although initial imaging studies suggested a possible bowel obstruction, a non-contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) scan was diagnostic. It demonstrated multiple jejunal diverticula, one of which exhibited an elongated morphology, wall thinning, and adjacent mesenteric fat stranding-findings consistent with a contained perforation. Due to persistent symptoms despite conservative management, an exploratory laparotomy was performed. Intraoperatively, a perforated jejunal diverticulum was identified 90 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz. A 5 cm segmental small bowel resection was performed, followed by a stapled side-to-side anastomosis with a functionally end-to-end configuration. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day four with favorable outpatient follow-up. This case underscores the importance of considering complicated jejunal diverticulitis in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain in elderly patients, even in the presence of atypical clinical findings. A non-contrast CT scan was essential for the early identification of the contained perforation, allowing for timely surgical intervention and a favorable outcome. A high index of clinical suspicion is crucial in this patient population to avoid potentially fatal diagnostic delays."

Acute appendicitis represents 15% of the causes of abdominal pain and 62% of the causes that require surgical treatment. Opioid analgesia has been evaluated in clinical trials, and they have determined it does not impact diagnostic accuracy. Despite evidence, withholding analgesia is still a common practice. Pain severely impacts quality of life and analgesia has become essential in humanised medicine. We aim to determine the safety and effectiveness of different opioid regimens for adult patients that present to the ER with acute suspected appendicitis. We will search MEDLINE and Embase via Ovid, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials without restrictions on the study publication date. Screening, extraction and risk of bias assessment will be performed in duplicate. We will use the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. We will perform both pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis (NMA) if transitivity and coherence principles are met. Heterogeneity will be evaluated using the I² and χ² and using the thresholds recommended by Cochrane. We will perform sensitivity analysis based on the pre-established potential effect modifiers, risk of bias and data that required transformation or imputation. Publication bias will be addressed by using funnel plots on a pairwise level. We will assess the strength of the body of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach (GRADE) per outcome, and evidence from the NMA will be assessed using the GRADE approach for NMA.

In fact, perforation is associated with short-term mortality and morbidity in up to 30 and 50% of patients, respectively, due to secondary peritonitis and sepsis. We hypothesized that postoperative clinical outcomes with duodenal perforation (DP) are worse than those with stomach perforation (SP). This retrospective study aimed to compare the early postoperative clinical outcomes of patients with SP and DP, focusing on morbidity and mortality, to identify differences that could indicate potential changes in surgical management. A total of 110 patients underwent emergency surgery between 2012 and 2022 for free SP or DP. We compared the demographic, intra-, and postoperative data, including morbidity and mortality during primary hospitalization in the two groups of patients. One group consisted of patients with SP and the second group consisted of patients with DP. The incidence of any postoperative complication, the rate of planned reoperation, median operation time, as well as the median hospital stay after surgery were significantly increased in patients with DP compared to those with SP. In addition, surgical and nonsurgical complications, as well as mortality were common in the total patient population, and higher in DP than in SP patients; however, these differences were not statistically significant. Common postoperative problems occurring after surgery for DP or SP are similar and often life-threatening in both situations. However, patients with DP experienced these problems significantly more often, indicating a more complex injury that required considerably more medical intervention and extended treatment. </p>."

    "title": "Unfavorable management outcome and its predictors among appendicitis patients in ethiopia: a systematic review and meta- analysis.",
    "abstract": "Appendicitis is life-threatening abdominal surgical emergency worldwide, requires timely medical intervention to prevent adverse outcomes such as wound infection, pneumonia, intra-peritoneal fluid collection, and death. These complications remain a significant challenge in Ethiopia. This study aimed to assess the pooled magnitude of unfavorable management outcome and identify associated factors among appendicitis patients in Ethiopia. We conducted a systematic search of databases for studies reporting appendicitis outcomes in Ethiopia. Eligible studies were screened based on predefined criteria. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 14. Heterogeneity was assessed with I² and Cochran's Q tests; due to substantial heterogeneity, a random-effects model was applied. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots, Egger's test, and the trim-and-fill method. Subgroup analyses explored sources of heterogeneity based on study region and hospital type. Eighteen studies articles were included. The pooled prevalence of unfavorable management outcome among appendicitis patient was 12.71% (95%CI: 9.32-16.09). Sub-group analysis showed that Oromia region had the highest prevalence of poor management outcome. Duration of illness [AOR = 4.41 (95%CI: 1.42-13.70)], right lower quadrant abdominal mass [AOR = 4.1 (95%CI: 2.29-7.34)], presence of intraoperative abscess [AOR = 6.9 (95% CI: 3.61-13.22)], lengths of postoperative hospital stays [OR = 5.28 (95%CI: 2.31-12.04)], elevated white blood cell count [AOR = 4.09 (95%CI: 2.22-7.54)] were a significant association with unfavorable management outcome of appendicitis. Unfavorable management outcomes in appendicitis patients in Ethiopia are significantly associated with several clinical factors. Enhancing early diagnosis, prompt surgical intervention, and standardized postoperative care are essential to reduce these adverse outcomes."

    "abstract": "Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) implantable devices such as the InterStim® device by Medtronic carry a small risk of stimulatory lead migration. In very rare cases migrated leads can injure the rectal wall resulting in a full-thickness perforation. The sequela of rectal perforation by SNM leads may have varied clinical presentation, and can remain undiagnosed without appropriate suspicion, increasing the risk for further complications. A 43-year-old woman with a history of multiple SNM device revisions presented to our emergency department (ED) with rectal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. SNM lead migration into the rectum and a full thickness perforation was visualized on computerized tomography (CT) imaging. A multidisciplinary evaluation was performed, and a subsequent management plan was developed for this patient's rare complication. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Rectal perforation is a rare event, and it is even more rare as a result of SNM lead migration. As emergency physicians, we should be aware of this rare complication, as the use of implantable SNM devices has risen over the last few decades. Based on the very few prior case reports, prognosis appears to be excellent, but prompt recognition of the complication is important to streamline proper management and prevent more serious downstream complications of untreated rectal perforation."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is one of the leading causes for emergency surgery in the United Kingdom (UK), with approximately 50,000 appendectomies performed annually. While imaging plays an increasingly important role in diagnosis, the lack of specific, unified guidelines guiding the utilisation of various imaging modalities causes ambiguity in how and when various modalities should be used. This study aimed to evaluate how various imaging modalities are being used in day-to-day practice, the practical aspects, the challenges, and the benefits of one scan over the others. This was done by comparing the diagnostic accuracy of various scans, such as ultrasound (US), CT, and MRI scans in suspected appendicitis cases. We retrospectively reviewed 200 recent appendectomy cases across two major hospitals in Manchester. After excluding 70 patients who either had no preoperative imaging or were diagnosed with something other than appendicitis, we analysed the radiology and histopathology reports of the remaining 130 patients. Special attention was given to the subgroup of 52 patients who initially underwent US. US had a sensitivity (Sn) of 56.25%, with 21 missed diagnoses later confirmed via CT, MRI, or histopathology. US should be commonly used for those under 18, but surprisingly, approximately two-thirds of US cases were adults, representing an inclination to use US as an initial investigation. In the under-18 group, US Sn was 80%, dropping to just 37.5% in the 18-29-year age group. US was not able to visualise the appendix in 34% (n=18) of patients, missing out on many appendicitis diagnoses. The CT scan was the most utilised scan and had a sensitivity of nearly 99%. The MRI scan, although limited in numbers, had a sensitivity of 100%. While US offers benefits such as speed and no radiation exposure, its diagnostic reliability varies with the patient's body habitus and the operator's skills. The appendix was not identified in a good proportion of patients; however, when the appendix was clearly visualised, it was associated with a better sensitivity. The CT scan was the most utilised scan. It also proved to have excellent sensitivity and is quicker to perform compared to an MRI scan. The MRI scan provides CT equivalent sensitivity but without exposure to harmful radiation. However, it was being underutilised due to limitations in practicality and availability. We routinely request these scans to support the diagnosis of appendicitis, but it is important to understand their diagnostic value, limitations, and when they are most appropriately used."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis (AAp) is a prevalent medical condition characterized by inflammation of the appendix that frequently necessitates urgent surgical procedures. Approximately two-thirds of patients with AAp exhibit characteristic signs and symptoms; hence, negative AAp and complicated AAp are the primary concerns in research on AAp. In other terms, further investigations and algorithms are required for at least one third of patients to predict the clinical condition and distinguish them from uncomplicated patients with AAp. To use a Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB)-based machine learning (ML) algorithm to tell the difference between AAp patients who are complicated and those who are not, and to find some important biomarkers for both types of AAp by using modeling to get variable importance values. This study analyzed an open access data set containing 140 people, including 41 healthy controls, 65 individuals with uncomplicated AAp, and 34 individuals with complicated AAp. We analyzed some demographic data (age, sex) of the patients and the following biochemical blood parameters: White blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, platelet count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio, mean platelet volume, neutrophil-to-immature granulocyte ratio, ferritin, total bilirubin, immature granulocyte count, immature granulocyte percent, and neutrophil-to-immature granulocyte ratio. We tested the SGB model using n-fold cross-validation. It was implemented with an 80-20 training-test split. We used variable importance values to identify the variables that were most effective on the target. The SGB model demonstrated excellent performance in distinguishing AAp from control patients with an accuracy of 96.3%, a micro aera under the curve (AUC) of 94.7%, a sensitivity of 94.7%, and a specificity of 100%. In distinguishing complicated AAp patients from uncomplicated ones, the model achieved an accuracy of 78.9%, a micro AUC of 79%, a sensitivity of 83.3%, and a specificity of 76.9%. The most useful biomarkers for confirming the AA diagnosis were WBC (100%), neutrophils (95.14%), and the lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (76.05%). On the other hand, the most useful biomarkers for accurate diagnosis of complicated AAp were total bilirubin (100%), WBC (96.90%), and the neutrophil-immature granulocytes ratio (64.05%). The SGB model achieved high accuracy rates in identifying AAp patients while it showed moderate performance in distinguishing complicated AAp patients from uncomplicated AAp patients. Although the model's accuracy in the classification of complicated AAp is moderate, the high variable importance obtained is clinically significant. We need further prospective validation studies, but the integration of such ML algorithms into clinical practice may improve diagnostic processes."

We report an exceptional case of complete ureteral avulsion following a dilation and curettage (D&C) procedure, successfully treated with renal autotransplantation. This represents the first documented case of renal autotransplantation in Yemen, highlighting a successful organ-preserving approach in a resource-limited setting. A 34-year-old female developed life-threatening complications following a D&C performed for retained products of conception. The procedure was complicated by uterine perforation and a complete avulsion of the left ureter, which was identified intraoperatively during emergent laparotomy. Initial management included pyelostomy, which failed, necessitating nephrostomy. Because to the absence of a viable ureteral stump, renal autotransplantation was performed. The kidney was reimplanted into the right iliac fossa, and urinary continuity was restored via a Boari flap. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and demonstrated preserved renal function at two-month follow-up. Complete ureteral avulsion is an exceedingly rare complication of D&C, often linked with uterine perforation. In cases where standard ureteral reconstruction is not feasible, renal autotransplantation provides a definitive, nephron-sparing solution. Early identification and referral to experienced centers are essential to optimizing outcomes."

Though transanal irrigation (TAI) is an effective management option for LARS symptoms, the treatment can still cause rare but severe complications, such as bowel perforation. We present a very rare case of a 78-year-old patient who developed a bowel perforation after 13 years of regular TAI. Gluteal pain, swelling, and purulent discharge were observed as presenting symptoms. Imaging and clinical examination revealed a perforated blind-ended bowel segment and a communicating abscess in the buttock. Urgent abscess drainage was performed, followed by an intersphincteric abdominoperineal excision and vacuum-assisted wound management (negative-pressure wound therapy). This case highlights the importance of long-term vigilance in patients using TAI, regardless of duration of use. Ongoing patient education, correct technique, and regular follow-up are essential to minimize risks and enable early detection of complications. Teaching patients how to care for themselves, using the right methods, and checking regularly are needed to control risks and see issues right away."

However, complications related to fluid absorption and capsular perforation can still occur. We report a rare case of severe refractory metabolic acidosis and acute abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) following HoLEP. A 74-year-old male with diabetes and hypertension underwent HoLEP for a 180-ml prostate, during which 106 liters of normal saline irrigation were used over three hours. Intraoperatively, the patient developed sudden respiratory distress and hypotension, with arterial blood gas analysis revealing severe metabolic acidosis (pH 7.141, HCO3 11 mEq/L, Cl 115 mEq/L), primarily due to excessive saline absorption and hyperchloremia. The patient required intubation, vasopressor support, and emergency dialysis due to worsening hemodynamic instability. Postoperative imaging revealed intra-abdominal fluid collection, which was drained percutaneously. After two days of intensive ICU management, the acidosis resolved, and the patient was successfully extubated. This is the first case highlighting the potential risks of normal saline absorption and the effect of capsular perforation, which caused ACS and refractory acidosis, and required CRRT due to the prolonged duration of HoLEP."

This real-world study evaluates clinical outcomes of liver cirrhosis patients receiving BCAA supplementation. This retrospective cohort study used the TriNetX US Collaborative Network to identify liver cirrhosis patients aged ≥ 18 years, stratified by BCAA supplementation after diagnosis. Propensity score matching (PSM) balanced cohorts by demographics, body mass index, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score components, and baseline history of cirrhosis complications, including hepatic encephalopathy (HE), sarcopenia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), acute kidney injury (AKI), and falls. Composite and individual outcomes within 5 years were assessed using odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Among 2,176 matched patients per group, BCAA supplementation was associated with lower rates of the composite outcome (OR 0.81, 95% CI: 0.71-0.92), HE (OR 0.63, 95% CI: 0.49-0.79), SBP (OR 0.77, 95% CI: 0.60-0.99), falls (OR 0.64, 95% CI: 0.53-0.78), all-cause emergency room visits (OR 0.56, 95% CI: 0.50-0.64), and hospitalizations (OR 0.68, 95% CI: 0.60-0.76).

    "abstract": "Vision loss following cosmetic filler injections is a rare but devastating complication resulting from inadvertent intravascular embolization, most often affecting the ophthalmic artery. Retrobulbar hyaluronidase injection has been proposed as an emergency intervention, yet anatomical guidelines for its administration remain poorly defined. To propose an anatomically informed protocol for safe and effective retrobulbar hyaluronidase injection in cases of filler-induced central retinal artery occlusion. Cadaveric dissections and micro-CT imaging were used to map orbital anatomy, focusing on the spatial relationship between the optic nerve, ophthalmic artery, and adjacent structures. The inferolateral quadrant was identified as the safest trajectory for retrobulbar injection, minimizing risk to ocular muscles and nerves. The optimal needle trajectory was from the inferolateral orbital rim toward the superior medial quadrant, avoiding critical neurovascular structures. A 35 mm, 22-23G needle was deemed appropriate for reaching the retrobulbar space while minimizing the risk of globe perforation. This study provides a standardized anatomical approach for retrobulbar hyaluronidase injection, aiming to improve safety and potentially restore perfusion in acute filler-induced visual loss. Clinical implementation should proceed with caution and in multidisciplinary settings."

    "abstract": "We present the case of a 60-year-old Caribbean man with no significant past medical history who presented to the emergency department with a three-week history of progressive, diffuse abdominal pain associated with early satiety and unintentional weight loss. Vital signs were stable, and physical examination revealed abdominal distension and diffuse tenderness without peritoneal signs. Laboratory studies were notable for elevated lactate dehydrogenase and mild leukocytosis. Computed tomography followed by PET-CT imaging demonstrated multiple nodular soft tissue densities with increased fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake throughout the mesentery, peritoneum, and bilateral pleural surfaces, raising concern for peritoneal lymphomatosis. An ultrasound-guided biopsy of an omental implant was performed, revealing large atypical lymphoid cells positive for CD3, CD2, and CD4, and negative for CD5, CD7, and CD8, with a Ki-67 proliferation index of 90%, consistent with an aggressive peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Peripheral blood RT-PCR returned positive for human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), aligning with the diagnosis of acute adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), stage IV. The patient's clinical course was rapidly progressive and marked by complications including spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome, recurrent episodes of malignant small bowel obstruction, and gram-negative bacteremia. While preparing for treatment with dose-adjusted etoposide phosphate, vincristine sulfate (Oncovin), cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin hydrochloride (hydroxydaunomycin) (EPOCH) chemotherapy, he suffered a cardiac arrest during central venous catheter placement. Despite resuscitation efforts, he sustained an anoxic brain injury and died 32 days after the initial presentation. This case highlights an aggressive presentation of ATLL with peritoneal involvement and underscores the challenges of rapid disease progression and acute complications, as well as the importance of considering endemic exposure history, utilizing PET-CT for identifying extranodal disease, and rapidly confirming diagnosis through biopsy."

We report the case of a middle-aged man who presented with acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed mural thickening and a target-like lesion at the ileocecal junction, raising suspicion for intussusception or carcinoma. Emergency surgery identified a cherry pit perforating a pseudodiverticulum in the ileocecal region. This case highlights the potential for hard fruit seeds to cause full-thickness bowel injury, especially in right-sided pseudodiverticula, which are more prevalent in Asian populations and lack a protective muscularis layer. Characteristic imaging features, such as hyperdense intraluminal objects with surrounding inflammation, can assist in differentiating these cases from neoplastic or inflammatory conditions. Taking a detailed dietary history and carefully reviewing CT scans using bone window settings can facilitate early diagnosis. Clinicians should remain aware of this rare but serious entity, as prompt surgical intervention is crucial in the presence of perforation or generalized peritonitis."

A total of 45 patients were included in the study, with a mean age of 37.9 ± 15.7 years. The male-female ratio was 1.5:1.0. Intestinal perforation was the most common diagnosis (15; 33.3%) that necessitated exploratory laparotomy. The cutoff of POSSUM morbidity score of 87.5% had a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 92.6%, while the cutoff P-POSSUM morbidity score of 88.6% yielded a sensitivity of 88.9% and a specificity of 96.3%. Regarding mortality prediction, the cutoff POSSUM mortality score of 56.7% had a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 94.6%, while a P-POSSUM mortality cutoff score of 22.7% had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 81.1%. Both POSSUM and P-POSSUM scores demonstrated significant sensitivity and specificity in predicting morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing emergency gastrointestinal surgeries.

Distal septic embolization from angio-IA with involvement of the small and large bowel is extremely uncommon, and clinical manifestations of bowel ischemia and perforation may be masked due to immunosuppression. We present herein the first reported case of peritonitis secondary to jejunal and cecal perforation secondary to angio-IA after lung transplantation (LT) in a 62-year-old male. The patient was admitted to the hospital for acute cellular rejection requiring high-dose immunosuppression. His course was complicated by respiratory failure secondary to IA, with resulting multiorgan system dysfunction during which time peritonitis was noted on examination and cross-sectional imaging demonstrated pneumatosis, portal venous gas, and pneumoperitoneum. The patient required emergent surgical intervention and underwent an exploratory laparotomy, jejunal resection, right hemicolectomy, and end ileostomy with colonic mucus fistula. Final pathologic analysis of resected specimens demonstrated angio-IA in both the jejunal and cecal segments with associated transmural ischemic necrosis. Bowel perforation secondary to angio-IA is a very rare but serious complication after LT that is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Evaluation requires a high index of suspicion in the setting of immunosuppression and often concomitant extraintestinal pathologies. Early, aggressive surgical intervention is necessary."

A 1-month-old female infant presented with respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation. Following intubation, the child deteriorated clinically, developing significant abdominal distension. Chest X-ray and abdominal X-ray revealed bilateral pneumothorax and pneumoperitoneum. Bilateral intercostal drains (ICDs) were placed, but due to worsening abdominal distension, an exploratory laparotomy was performed within a few hours. No evidence of hollow viscus perforation was found. Tense pneumoperitoneum confirmed with gush of air on opening the abdomen. The presence of air inside the left paracolic gutter extending to the diaphragm indicating it is from pneumothorax. The abdomen was closed with a drain, which was removed after 48 h.

    "abstract": "The inflammation of the diverticular pouch is called acute diverticulitis which can result in abscess formations sometimes. Percutaneous drainage is routinely considered for the management of diverticular abscesses. Being a minimally invasive procedure employed for the removal of large collections of infected fluid from the abscesses, percutaneous drainage emerged as an appealing option. Historically, surgical removal of the abscesses has resulted in multiple hospitalizations and an increased burden on healthcare resources. With the advancement in radiological techniques, CT-guided percutaneous drainage of diverticular abscesses ensured enhanced patient satisfaction and reduced healthcare costs. The choice between surgery or percutaneous drainage of diverticular abscess remains a matter of debate among physicians. The outcomes of percutaneous drainage procedures are scattered across the literature. It is important to be familiar with the criteria regarding the choice of percutaneous drainage or colectomy during the management of diverticular abscesses. Percutaneous drainage can prevent emergent colectomy but it is not always a risk-free procedure. It can bring complications including persistent abscess, new onset abscess, abdominal wall abscess, and peritonitis. Therefore, a physician must prepare in advance to prevent these complications by selecting the right population for the procedure and ensuring good catheter care which involves readjusting the catheter, flushing the catheter and upgrading the size of the catheter. A physician not only prevents these complications but also effectively treats them. This review paper aims to summarize the important outcomes of percutaneous drainage of diverticular abscesses and their further management from a clinical standpoint."

The primary outcome was the rate of severe adverse events including postoperative bleeding and perforation. The secondary outcomes were adverse events per the Clavien-Dindo classification, abdominal pain, hematochezia after the procedure, emergency colonoscopy, and rehospitalization. Patients with FAP who underwent IDP with conventional hot snare polypectomy using bipolar snares from January 2021 to December 2021 were examined as historical controls (bipolar group) for comparison with patients who underwent IDP with LPPC-HSP (LPPC-HSP group). Among 36 patients with FAP enrolled between July 2023 and June 2024, 33 were included in the analysis. The median age was 31 years, and 16 patients were male. A total of 6581 polyps were resected. Two patients (one with postoperative bleeding and the other with postoperative bleeding and delayed perforation) in the LPPC-HSP group (n = 33) and four patients (all with postoperative bleeding) in the bipolar group (n = 37) experienced severe adverse events (p = 0.677). In conclusion, LPPC-HSP is feasible and may be considered a treatment option for patients with FAP undergoing IDP. TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN-CTR: UMIN000051414."

    "abstract": "Perforated gastric ulcers represent life-threatening surgical emergencies with particularly high morbidity and mortality in elderly patients. While omental patch repair remains the standard treatment for duodenal perforations, optimal management of complex gastric perforations, especially those with necrosis or concurrent lesions, remains controversial. We present the case of a 72-year-old Iranian woman with multiple comorbidities who presented with septic shock secondary to gastric perforation. Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed a 1.5-cm perforation with surrounding necrosis and an adjacent gastric polyp. The patient successfully underwent combined laparoscopic wedge resection and omental patch repair, demonstrating the feasibility of this minimally invasive approach in high-risk patients. The procedure included complete excision of necrotic tissue and polyp with stapled wedge resection, followed by reinforcement using a vascularized omental patch. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, with the patient discharged on day 10. Histopathology confirmed benign ulceration without malignancy. At the 3-month follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic with no recurrence. This case highlights that laparoscopic wedge resection with omental patch repair offers both diagnostic and therapeutic advantages for complex gastric perforations, particularly when tissue viability is questionable or concurrent lesions are present. The technique combines the benefits of minimally invasive surgery, reduced morbidity, and faster recovery with the reliability of traditional omental patching. The successful outcome highlights the expanding role of laparoscopy in emergency general surgery for high-risk populations."

Despite successful covered stent deployment and pericardiocentesis, iatrogenic right ventricular perforation occurred owing to a misplaced pericardial sheath. A novel dual-device strategy combining ProGlide and StarClose (Abbott) SE vascular closure devices achieved complete hemostasis under real-time transthoracic echocardiography and digital subtraction angiography. Key innovations include the first hybrid vascular closure device application for right ventricular perforation, synchronized pericardial drainage, and protocolized autotransfusion.

    "abstract": "Perforated peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is a critical condition that can present with atypical symptoms, leading to misdiagnosis and treatment delays. While PUD classically presents with peritonitis, rare cases may induce localized inflammatory responses, mimicking other abdominal pathologies such as acute cholecystitis. We report the case of a 29-year-old male with recurrent postprandial right upper quadrant (RUQ) and epigastric pain. Despite multiple emergency department (ED) visits, normal initial imaging led to misdiagnoses of gastroenteritis and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with cannabis-induced hyperemesis syndrome. On his third ED visit, he was diagnosed with a perforated gastric ulcer complicated by acute cholecystitis, requiring urgent surgical intervention. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges associated with atypical presentations of perforated PUD. The absence of gallstones and initial negative imaging studies contributed to diagnostic delays. Advanced imaging, including computed tomography (CT), plays a crucial role in detecting subtle signs of perforation. Additionally, the inflammatory interaction between the gastric and hepatobiliary systems underscores the need for clinicians to consider ulcer-related complications when evaluating persistent epigastric and RUQ pain. A high index of suspicion is essential when assessing patients with recurrent abdominal pain despite unremarkable initial evaluations. Early recognition and appropriate imaging can facilitate timely intervention, reducing morbidity associated with delayed diagnosis of perforated PUD and its complications."

    "abstract": "Esophageal perforation is a rare but life-threatening condition with historically high morbidity and mortality. Traditional management has relied on urgent surgical repair, but advances in endoscopic therapy have expanded non-surgical options. We present a case of an 84-year-old male patient with an esophageal perforation caused by food impaction in the setting of a Schatzki ring, successfully managed through a stepwise endoscopic approach using a fully covered self-expanding metal stent (FCSEMS) followed by argon plasma coagulation (APC) and endoscopic clipping to close a residual defect. The patient with risk factors including advanced age, chronic esophageal strictures, and a history of repeated dilations presented with acute dysphagia and chest pain following food impaction. Imaging revealed a distal esophageal perforation with pneumomediastinum and developing mediastinal fluid collection. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) identified an impacted food bolus and a 1 cm perforation surrounded by necrotic debris. Endoscopic debridement was performed, and a fully covered 23 mm × 120 mm EndoMAXX esophageal stent (Merit Medical Systems, Inc., South Jordan, UT) was deployed under fluoroscopic guidance to seal the defect. At the two-week follow-up EGD, the stent remained in position with granulation tissue formation. Due to persistent dysphagia, likely secondary to stent-related granulation tissue, mucosal inflammation, or mechanical irritation, the stent was removed. At eight weeks, a small residual 3 mm perforation was visualized. This was treated with APC (1.2 L/min, 20 W) to ablate epithelialized edges, followed by mechanical closure using two MANTIS clips (Boston Scientific Corporation, Marlborough, MA). A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy-jejunostomy (PEG-J) tube was surgically placed for enteral support. A 10-week endoscopy confirmed mucosal healing with embedded clips and no surrounding inflammation. At 16 weeks, an esophagram demonstrated complete closure without a leak. The PEG-J tube was removed, and the patient resumed normal oral intake, underscoring the effectiveness of stepwise endoscopic management for esophageal perforation. This case illustrates the effective use of multimodal endoscopic therapy for esophageal perforation. Fully covered stent placement achieved initial closure and containment, while a secondary endoscopic intervention (APC with clipping) successfully sealed a persistent micro-perforation. The sequential minimally invasive approach obviated the need for thoracic surgery and its associated risks. Advances in endoscopic stents, tissue ablation, and clipping devices offer a paradigm shift in managing esophageal perforations, especially in elderly or high-risk patients."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction (SBO) during pregnancy is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition, with high maternal and fetal morbidity. Among the rarest etiologies is ileo-ileal knotting, a rarely encountered surgical emergency with only seven reported cases in pregnancy, including one ileo-ileal knot, as per Shimizu et al. (2014). Its timely diagnosis is often hindered by overlapping obstetric and gastrointestinal symptoms. We present the case of a 30-year-old woman at 25 weeks gestation who experienced severe abdominal pain, distension, and constipation for five days. Initially managed conservatively at a peripheral facility, she suffered a spontaneous fetal loss and was referred to a tertiary center. Exploratory laparotomy revealed an ileo-ileal knot with necrotic bowel, necessitating resection and primary anastomosis. Postoperative recovery was complicated by wound infection but resulted in full recovery with no long-term sequelae. Ileo-ileal knotting results in rapid bowel ischemia and necrosis due to vascular compromise. Risk factors may include pregnancy-related bowel displacement and predisposing anatomical anomalies such as adhesions or Meckel's diverticulum. Diagnosis is often delayed due to atypical presentation and limited access to imaging in low-resource settings. Early surgical intervention remains the cornerstone of management, as delayed treatment significantly increases morbidity and mortality. This case highlights the need for a high index of suspicion for rare causes of intestinal obstruction in pregnancy. Prompt surgical management can improve maternal and fetal outcomes. In low-resource settings, early clinical decision-making remains essential to preventing complications when advanced diagnostics are unavailable."

    "abstract": "A gastrothorax occurs when the stomach becomes displaced into the thoracic cavity. Rarely, this gastrothorax can rupture, which can lead to respiratory distress, hemodynamic compromise, and cardiac arrest. Here, we discuss the case of a 69-year-old male who presented to the emergency department (ED) for evaluation of generalized weakness and shortness of breath without associated upper respiratory symptoms. On physical exam, the patient was hemodynamically unstable with absent lung sounds on the left. A portable chest X-ray (CXR) was obtained, which initially revealed concern for tension hydropneumothorax. A chest tube was placed, which drained a large amount of bilious fluid and stabilized the patient. CT imaging revealed a large diaphragmatic hernia with herniation of the stomach into the left hemithorax and a chest tube coursing lateral to and above the stomach. The patient was taken emergently to the operating room, where a large area of necrosis was noted about the greater curvature of the stomach with ischemic perforation. The patient underwent partial gastrectomy and primary diaphragmatic hernia repair and recovered despite a complicated hospital course. Ruptured gastrothorax is rare and presents similarly to other causes of tension physiology. Clinicians should consider CT imaging in stable patients when diaphragmatic hernia or ruptured gastrothorax is possible, and should consider placing a chest tube above the level of the stomach if they suspect this diagnosis by history and CXR in an unstable patient."

    "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) combined with ventricular septal perforation (VSR) is still a highly fatal condition in the era of reperfusion therapy. The incidence rate has decreased to 0.2%-0.4% due to the popularization of percutaneous coronary intervention. However, the risk is significantly increased for those who fail to undergo revascularization in time, and the mortality rate remains high. The current core contradiction in clinical practice lies in the selection of surgical timing, and the disparity in medical resources significantly affects prognosis. There is an urgent need to optimize the identification of high-risk populations and individualized treatment strategies. To investigate the clinical features, determine the prognostic factors, and develop a predictive model for 30-day mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by ventricular septal rupture (AMI-VSR) residing in high-altitude regions. This study retrospectively analyzed 48 AMI-VSR patients admitted to a Yunnan hospital from 2017 to 2024, with the establishment of survival (n = 30) and mortality (n = 18) groups based on patients' survival status. Risk factors were identified by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. A nomogram model was developed using R software and validated via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and calibration curves. Age, uric acid (UA), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and low hemoglobin (Hb) were independent risk factors for 30-day mortality (odds ratios: 1.147, 1.006, 1.034, and 0.941, respectively; P < 0.05). The nomogram demonstrated excellent discrimination (area under the ROC curve = 0.939) and calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow χ² = 2.268, P = 0.971). In addition, patients' poor outcomes could be synergistically predicted by IL-6 and UA, advanced age, and reduced Hb. This study highlights age, UA, IL-6, and Hb as critical predictors of mortality in AMI-VSR patients at high altitudes. The validated nomogram provides a practical tool for early risk stratification and tailored interventions, addressing gaps in managing this high-risk population in resource-limited settings."

It is characterized by distinct clinical presentation. This case report describes a rare case of strangulated obturator hernia. A 82-year-old woman came to the emergency department with bowel obstruction and altered general condition. Abdominal and pelvic CT revealed a mechanical bowel obstruction upstream of a strangulated left obturator hernia. An exploratory laparotomy confirmed the strangulated nature of the left obturator hernia. The herniated bowel was reduced manually, with resumption of normal loop staining and herniorrhaphy. Post-operative management was straightforward. Obturator hernia is a relatively rare type of abdominal hernia in which the abdominal contents protrude through the obturator canal, which can lead to obstruction of the small intestine. Most patients with obturator hernia present with symptoms of intestinal obstruction. Today, CT is the examination of choice. Strangulated obturator hernia is treated surgically. Obturator hernia is usually asymptomatic, but can be complicated by strangulation. CT is the key examination for positive diagnosis. Once the diagnosis of occlusion has been made, emergency surgery is indicated."

We report a case of an 18-year-old male with a history of psychiatric condition who presented to the emergency department with symptoms of hollow viscus perforation and peritonitis after intentionally ingestion of multiple metal bezoars. Radiographic findings revealed multiple metallic objects, a dilated stomach, and free air under the diaphragm bilaterally. An emergency exploratory laparotomy was done, involving gastrotomy and primary repair of the gastric perforation. For long-term management, medication and behavioural therapy are the essential preventive measures. This case emphasizes the importance of recognizing metal bezoars as a potential cause of gastrointestinal emergencies in psychiatric patients.

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis (AA) remains the most common cause of emergency abdominal surgery, yet achieving precise preoperative risk stratification is still challenging, particularly among elderly patients. Recent interest has focused on systemic inflammatory biomarkers and the role of immunosenescence in influencing disease progression. We retrospectively analyzed 407 adult patients who underwent appendectomy over a six-year period at a tertiary hospital. Patients were grouped by age and histopathological subtype. Preoperative blood counts were used to calculate systemic inflammatory indices, including NLR, PLR, SII, SIRI, and AISI. Associations between biomarkers and histopathological severity were assessed using multivariable multinomial logistic regression, with adjustments for age and hospitalization duration. Higher neutrophil counts and elevated PLR were significantly associated with gangrenous appendicitis (p < 0.001 and p = 0.047, respectively). Increased SIRI and neutrophil levels predicted phlegmonous appendicitis (p = 0.020 and p < 0.001). Age independently correlated with more severe histopathological forms. Distinct variations in inflammatory profiles were observed across different age groups and histological categories. Systemic inflammatory indices, particularly NLR, PLR, SII, and SIRI, hold considerable promise for enhancing preoperative stratification in acute appendicitis. Their integration into clinical practice could improve diagnostic accuracy, especially in older patients affected by immunosenescence."

    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Acute appendicitis is a common cause of abdominal pain requiring surgery in pediatric patients. Given concerns regarding radiation exposure from computed tomography (CT), ultrasound (US) has become the first-line diagnostic modality. In many emergency and resource-limited settings, non-radiologist physicians often perform these examinations. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a non-radiologist-performed ultrasound in detecting acute appendicitis in children. Materials and Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis according to the PRISMA guidelines. The literature was searched across PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar through June 2024. Studies reporting on the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of non-radiologist-performed ultrasounds in pediatric appendicitis were included. Study quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool, and a bivariate random-effects model was used for statistical analysis. Results: Eight studies, with a total of 1006 pediatric patients, were included. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.87 (95% CI, 0.83-0.90) and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.91-0.95), respectively. The area under the SROC curve was 0.783 (95% CI, 0.708-0.853), suggesting moderate-to-good diagnostic accuracy. Substantial heterogeneity was observed across studies, possibly due to differences in operator training and ultrasound techniques. Conclusions: Non-radiologist-performed ultrasound demonstrates moderate-to-good diagnostic accuracy in identifying pediatric appendicitis. These findings support its implementation in emergency or resource-constrained settings and suggest that incorporating structured ultrasound training for non-radiologists may improve timely diagnosis and optimize clinical decision-making in pediatric emergency care."

    "title": "A Decade-Long Case Series Report on the Surgical Management of Complicated Umbilical Hernia in Patients with Decompensated Liver Cirrhosis Utilizing Incisional Negative Pressure Therapy.",
    "abstract": "Background and Objectives. Umbilical hernia is particularly common among patients with liver cirrhosis, affecting about 20% of this group, compared to 3-8.5% in healthy individuals. This increased prevalence is mainly due to weakened abdominal fascia, elevated intra-abdominal pressure, and malnutrition. The rapid progression of umbilical hernias often leads to complications such as skin necrosis, perforation, and strangulation. Historically, patients with liver cirrhosis and complicated umbilical hernia have faced high morbidity and mortality rates. However, recent advancements in perioperative management, especially in controlling ascites, have improved outcomes in elective treatments. Despite these advancements, managing patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis and complicated umbilical hernia in emergency settings remain a significant surgical challenge. Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of patients treated for complicated umbilical hernia at the University Medical Centre Ljubljana from 2015 to 2024, using prospectively collected data. This analysis involved implementing hernioplasty combined with incisional negative pressure wound therapy (iNPWT) as part of the surgical protocol. The primary endpoint of our study was the rate of local complications, while the secondary endpoints included the rate of systemic complications and 90-day mortality. Results: We treated 28 consecutive patients with complicated umbilical hernia and liver cirrhosis. Local wound complications were observed in three (10.7%) patients. Systemic complications developed in 10 patients (35.7%). The median duration of hospitalization was 8 days (range: 5-29), and no readmissions were recorded within the 30-day period. Two (7.1%) patients died within 90 days. Conclusions: Our experience indicates that iNPWT, when combined with surgical repair, can be safely utilized, yielding outcomes comparable to elective hernia repairs, even in emergency contexts. Further randomized controlled trials are necessary to validate these findings and optimize treatment protocols."

This study aimed to clarify the predictive factors of appendiceal tumors before appendectomy. We retrospectively analyzed 434 patients diagnosed with acute appendicitis who underwent emergency or interval appendectomy. Appendiceal neoplasms were found in 3.9% of patients. Patients with tumors were significantly older (64.4 vs. 49.6 years, p < 0.001). The tumor group exhibited a lower appendicolith incidence (48% vs. 12%, p = 0.011) and larger appendiceal diameters (18.0 vs. 12.3 mm, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that age ≥60 years, absence of appendicolith, and an appendiceal diameter ≥12 mm were independent risk factors of appendiceal tumors. Among patients who underwent interval appendectomy, only the non-tumor group exhibited significant improvement in appendiceal diameter after nonoperative management (tumor, +1.6 mm vs. no tumor, -3.5 mm, p < 0.001). Advanced age, absence of appendicolith, and an enlarged appendiceal diameter may be significant predictive factors of appendiceal tumors. These factors will aid in the selection of appropriate appendicitis treatment strategies."

The incarcerated small intestine was reduced without requiring resection, and the iTMD was closed with barbed suture. TMHs are rare and often difficult to diagnose preoperatively. Early recognition using characteristic computed tomographic findings can facilitate timely laparoscopic intervention and avoid complications such as bowel necrosis.

Due to suspicion of cholecystitis, he underwent emergency surgery, which revealed a gallbladder metastasis of the melanoma. Gastrointestinal metastases of melanoma are frequently asymptomatic and are often diagnosed only upon the occurrence of complications such as obstruction, hemorrhage, or perforation. Nonetheless, metastases to the gallbladder in the context of advanced melanoma are not uncommon. In patients with a prior history of melanoma presenting with new-onset abdominal symptoms or iron deficiency anemia, metastatic involvement of intra-abdominal organs should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Given the often multifocal nature of intra-abdominal melanoma metastases, comprehensive imaging and histopathological evaluation are critical for accurate diagnosis.

We found no literature validating physiologic hydronephrosis as a cause of emergent right abdominal pain. We aimed to evaluate whether the incidence of hydronephrosis is higher in patients with right abdominal pain and no other identifiable cause, as compared to asymptomatic pregnant women (APW). A retrospective review of abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed for acute abdominal pain (AAP) in pregnant patients with no identifiable cause, compared to MRI performed for fetal evaluation in APW. Two readers (R1/R2) performed qualitative evaluation of hydronephrosis and hydroureters, and quantitative measurement of ureteral maximal diameter. Inter-rater agreement was calculated. The study included 39 AAP and 162 APW patients, mean ages 31.0±4 and 31.7±5 years respectively. Quantitative and qualitative measurements showed no statistically significant differences between the groups. Right hydronephrosis was found in 33.3%/53.8% of AAP versus 43.8%/45.1% of APW (P=0.280/P=0.324, R1/R2 respectively). Right hydroureter was found in 28.2%/33.3% of AAP versus 28.4%/30.9% of APW (P=0.946/P=0.765, R1/R2 respectively). Inter-reader agreement showed good to excellent reliability in qualitative and quantitative measurements. Emergent right abdominal pain in pregnant patients with no appendicitis or other identifiable causes was not related to a higher incidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter, as compared to asymptomatic ambulatory pregnant patients. The findings suggest that emergent right abdominal pain in these patients is not necessarily attributable to physiologic hydronephrosis and alternative diagnoses should be carefully considered."

    "abstract": "Ovarian vein thrombosis (OVT) is a rare condition that most commonly affects postpartum women. It is particularly prevalent in the first 10 days postpartum, a period when women are more prone to developing this condition. The right ovarian vein is often affected due to its tortuous nature and less competent valves. OVT presents similarly to acute abdominal conditions, such as acute appendicitis, especially when the right ovarian vein is involved. Given the overlap in clinical presentation, diagnosis requires high-quality imaging techniques and a high degree of suspicion. Herein, we report a rare case of OVT in a young postpartum female who presented to the emergency department with signs and symptoms of acute abdomen. The patient had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis treatment. A provisional diagnosis of a perforated appendix was made, and a lower midline exploratory laparotomy was planned. During surgery, the appendix and intestines appeared normal, but a distended and thrombosed right ovarian vein was found. The affected ovarian vein was excised, and the patient was placed on anticoagulants postoperatively. The recovery was unremarkable, and anticoagulants were continued for six months. OVT is most commonly seen in the early postpartum period, especially within the first 10 days. Due to its anatomical characteristics, the right ovarian vein is more commonly involved. The clinical presentation of OVT can closely mimic acute abdomen or acute appendicitis, making diagnosis challenging. Accurate diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and advanced imaging techniques to differentiate OVT from other conditions with similar presentations."

Due to its rarity and nonspecific clinical features, preoperative diagnosis of internal hernia is challenging. We report the case of a 95-year-old female patient (body mass index: 19.5) without a history of abdominal surgery, who presented with vomiting and abdominal pain. The patient had a medical history of cerebral infarction, pneumonectomy, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dementia. Laboratory test results revealed leukocytosis and mild inflammation. Abdominal CT revealed closed-loop ileus on the left side of the ascending colon with localized small bowel dilatation. Chest CT indicated aspiration pneumonia. Based on these findings, a preoperative diagnosis of an internal hernia with strangulated ileus and aspiration pneumonia was made, necessitating an emergency surgery. Intraoperatively, a segment of the jejunum located 50-70 cm from the ligament of Treitz was herniated through a congenital defect in the ascending mesocolon. The ischemic jejunal bowel was resected and the mesenteric defect was closed. The operative time was 81 min with minimal blood loss.

Although transmesocolic hernias of the ascending colon are extremely rare, they should be considered in the differential diagnosis of small bowel obstruction, particularly in older, thin female patients without a history of abdominal surgery. Early diagnosis and timely surgical intervention are essential for achieving favorable outcomes."

    "abstract": "Pregnancy complicated with appendicitis is a common and serious disease, with atypical clinical manifestations and easy confusion of diseases. The prognosis is mainly related to early diagnosis and timely surgical treatment, as well as the gestational age. This is a patient in mid pregnancy who experienced abdominal pain, high fever for several days, and examination reports indicating acute appendicitis. Due to congestion of pelvic organs and appendix during pregnancy, inflammation developed rapidly, resulting in suppuration and perforation of the appendix, requiring emergency surgery. The final diagnosis is mid pregnancy, acute suppurative appendiceal perforation. Due to the need to alleviate the patient's current symptoms and protect the fetus during pregnancy, emergency surgery is required. During the surgery, the patient's appendix was found to have suppurative perforation and severe infection. After the surgery, a large amount or combination of antibiotics is needed, but the impact of the drugs on the fetus should be considered. Therefore, anti-infection, nutritional support, and fetal protection treatment should be carried out simultaneously. The patient's infection decreased, fever symptoms disappeared and there was no abdominal pain after eating. The fetus was not affected by the disease and was discharged smoothly. For pregnant patients, both the patient, and the fetus should be treated and protected simultaneously. By studying this case, we aim to enhance the clinical thinking of nursing staff and improve the quality of nursing service technology."

    "title": "Spontaneous Terminal Ileum GIST Perforation Causing an Acute Abdomen in an Elderly Patient-A Rare Case.",
    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are rare mesenchymal tumors primarily located in the stomach and small intestine; their occurrence in the terminal ileum is particularly rare. Although GISTs can develop throughout the gastrointestinal tract, cases of perforation in elderly individuals are even less common, posing significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This case report describes an 86-year-old male patient with an acute abdomen caused by a terminal ileum perforated GIST requiring urgent surgical intervention. An immunohistochemical examination of the tumor confirmed a GIST with a GILT (gastrointestinal leiomyogenic tumor) immunophenotype. The rarity of this condition makes it diagnostically challenging, as its symptoms are often nonspecific, and GISTs are frequently overlooked, particularly in older patients. This case supplements the existing literature by emphasizing the importance of considering GIST perforation in the differential diagnosis of an acute abdomen, even in elderly patients and in rare anatomical locations."

    "abstract": "Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with social-communication challenges that can hinder timely diagnosis and treatment during acute medical events (AMEs). The purpose of this report is to review the literature on medical comorbidities and AMEs in adults with profound ASD and highlight how healthcare teams can better understand atypical presentations of acute pain and discomfort in adults with profound ASD to reduce delayed diagnoses, delays in treatment, and ultimately improve health outcomes. Methods: The literature on medical comorbidities and AMEs in adults with profound ASD was reviewed using the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar. The histories of three adults with profound ASD who experienced AMEs-specifically, appendicitis, nephrolithiasis, and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)-are described. The clinical cases were selected to illustrate the challenges inherent in diagnosing and treating AMEs in adults with profound ASD in the context of the review. Results: In Case 1, a 31-year-old male with autism was diagnosed with perforated appendicitis after his family noticed behavioral changes. In Case 2, a 36-year-old male with autism experienced intermittent pain from nephrolithiasis and communicated his discomfort through irritability and pointing. In Case 3, a 34-year-old male with autism exhibited atypical behavior due to pain from undiagnosed EoE, identified after years of untreated pain and multiple unsuccessful clinical procedures. Conclusions: This review and the illustrative cases demonstrate the significant role that communication barriers play in delayed medical diagnoses for adults with profound ASD during AMEs. Integrating caregiver insights and recognizing atypical pain expressions are essential for improving the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis and treatment in this population."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis remains a common surgical emergency with potentially fatal complications. Long-term trends in mortality disparities are not well characterized. We analyzed demographic and regional disparities in appendicitis-related mortality in the United States from 1999 to 2020 using CDC WONDER data. We performed a retrospective analysis of death-certificate data for individuals aged ≥ 25 years, identifying appendicitis-related deaths (ICD-10 K35-K37). Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) per 100,000 population were standardized to the 2000 U.S. Joinpoint regression estimated annual percentage changes (APCs) and average APCs (AAPCs) with 95% confidence intervals. Analyses were stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, urbanization, and state. From 1999 to 2020, 15,243 appendicitis-related deaths occurred (6643 females and 8600 males). Overall AAMR declined from 0.38 to 0.32 per 100,000 (AAPC -1.38% and 95% CI -3.10 to 0.36). A significant decrease occurred from 1999 to 2018 (APC-2.81% and p < 0.0001), followed by a nonsignificant rise. Males exhibited a consistent decline (AAPC -2.88% and p < 0.0001), whereas females experienced an increase from 2016 to 2020 (APC +5.94% and p < 0.0001). Black individuals had the highest AAMR (0.38) but a significant decline (AAPC -3.73% and p < 0.0001) compared to Whites (AAPC -2.49% and p < 0.0001) and Hispanics (AAPC -2.06% and p < 0.0001). Nonmetropolitan areas had higher AAMR (0.34) than metropolitan areas (0.31). Vermont and New Mexico recorded the highest state-level AAMRs; New Jersey and Louisiana had the lowest. Appendicitis-related mortality in the United States declined over two decades; however, rising mortality among females since 2016 and persistent racial and regional disparities underscore the need for targeted interventions to ensure equitable access to timely surgical care."

    "abstract": "Sepsis causes systemic organ and tissue dysfunction, among which myocardial injury has become an urgent clinical problem. Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) is a serine-threonine kinase that plays an important role in cellular activities. In this study, we investigated the regulatory role of HIPK2 regarding the level of ferroptosis in septic myocardial injury. Trends in ferroptosis and HIPK2 expression were observed over time in a mouse model of sepsis in which cecum ligation perforation was performed. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated H9c2 cells were used to establish the experimental model, and both HIPK2 overexpression and HIPK2 knockdown H9c2 cells were used to measure the levels of inflammatory markers and ferroptosis-associated proteins. The experimental data revealed that the model mice exhibited greater degrees of myocardial injury, cardiac dysfunction, and ferroptosis compared with normal sham-operated mice, and these effects progressively worsened with increasing duration of sepsis. HIPK2 expression progressively decreased with a prolonged duration of sepsis. Compared with the control H9c2 cells, the LPS-treated H9c2 cells exhibited decreased cell viability and increased cytotoxicity, ferroptosis, and inflammatory responses. HIPK2 overexpression downregulated the levels of inflammatory and ferroptosis mediators, whereas HIPK2 knockdown demonstrated the opposite effects. HIPK2 may play a protective role against septic myocardial injury by modulating ferroptosis."

    "abstract": "A 60-year-old male presented with sudden-onset right-sided abdominal pain radiating to the back, along with vomiting and constipation for four days. Clinical examination revealed a distended and diffusely tender abdomen with absent bowel sounds. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdomen showed near-complete thrombotic occlusion of the proximal superior mesenteric artery with distal reformation, infarcts in the liver and spleen, and features suggestive of small bowel necrosis and perforation. An emergency laparotomy revealed gangrene involving the distal jejunum, ileum, cecum, appendix, ascending colon, and part of the transverse colon. The patient underwent right hemicolectomy with resection of the distal jejunum and ileum, followed by distal jejunostomy and transverse colostomy. Histopathology confirmed transmural gangrene and thrombi in mesenteric vessels. This case describes the clinical presentation, radiological findings, surgical management, and histopathological features in a patient with extensive bowel involvement due to superior mesenteric artery thrombosis."

Surgical intervention is the treatment of choice when bowel obstruction occurs. The goal of surgery is both therapeutic and diagnostic, allowing for resection and pathological evaluation. This case of a 76-year-old female shows that early recognition and prompt surgery are crucial for a favorable outcome. The patient exhibited symptoms of bowel obstruction. The computed tomography scan clearly demonstrated intussusception of the terminal ileum into the cecum. The patient underwent urgent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with extracorporeal anastomosis. Histological findings: intussusception with a tubulovillous adenoma with low-grade dysplasia and without invasive features. In this case, an underlying potentially malignant evolving condition was discovered and removed. In conclusion, early recognition and intervention are key to improving outcomes in patients with intussusception and intestinal obstruction signs."

    "abstract": "Gallbladder perforation is a rare but serious complication, usually following acute cholecystitis. Spontaneous perforation without prior biliary symptoms is extremely uncommon and often presents as acute peritonitis, especially in the elderly and/or immunocompromised patients. Early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality. A 76-year-old male with no prior history of gallbladder disease presented with a 3-day history of right upper quadrant pain and signs of generalized peritonitis. Imaging revealed a perforation in the gallbladder fundus with pericholecystic fluid and intraluminal stones. Emergency laparotomy confirmed a 5 mm fundal perforation with 500 ml of bile-stained peritoneal fluid. Cholecystectomy and peritoneal lavage were performed. The patient recovered uneventfully. Spontaneous gallbladder perforation is rare, especially without prior cholecystitis. It most commonly occurs at the fundus due to its limited blood supply, making it susceptible to ischemia. While cholecystitis is more frequent in females, perforation is more common in elderly males. Clinical signs may be nonspecific, and perforation is often diagnosed only via imaging or intraoperatively. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography is the most sensitive imaging modality, identifying mural defects, pericholecystic fluid, and fat stranding. Laparoscopic or open cholecystectomy with peritoneal lavage remains the mainstay of treatment. Spontaneous gallbladder perforation should be considered in elderly patients with an acute abdomen, even without a history of gallbladder disease. Timely imaging and surgical management are vital for favorable outcomes. Early recognition, appropriate classification, and individualized treatment planning can significantly reduce complications and improve long-term prognosis."

    "abstract": "Introduction: People living with HIV (PLWHIV) have historically faced discrimination and unequal access to healthcare in the United States. This study aims to investigate differences in surgical intervention for common surgical emergencies among this population, specifically cholecystitis and appendicitis. Methods: This study utilized the TriNetX® database to compare the rate of cholecystectomies and appendectomies among PLWHIV with diagnosed cholecystitis or appendicitis, respectively, compared with HIV-negative patients. Inclusion criteria were an indication for surgical intervention, cholecystitis (K81) or appendicitis (K35-37). Cohorts were defined by HIV status, and analysis was stratified by procedure. Cohorts were propensity matched for age, race, leukocyte count, HIV 1 RNA volume, and substance abuse disorders. Outcomes were defined as patients receiving cholecystectomy or appendectomy in two separate analyses. Relative difference (RD) and relative risk (RR) were compared with between HIV+ and HIV- cohorts. Results: The cholecystectomy analysis had 609,127 total patients, with 3,597 per cohort after matching. The appendectomy analysis had 641,395 total patients, with 2,368 per cohort after matching. HIV-positive patients with cholecystitis had a 16.736% risk of undergoing cholecystectomy compared with 23.019% risk in HIV-cholecystitis patients (RD: -6.283% [95% confidence interval (95% CI): -8.122%, -4.444%], p < 0.0001, RR 0.727 [95% CI: 0.662, 0.799]). HIV-positive patients with appendicitis had a 14.147% risk of undergoing appendectomy compared with 17.272% in HIV-appendicitis patients (RD: -3.125%% [95% CI: -5.196%, -1.054%], p < 0.0031, RR 0.819, [95% CI 0.717, 0.935]). Conclusions: This study demonstrates a significant disparity in timely surgical intervention for PLWHIV. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the etiology of demonstrated incongruencies and their clinical relevance."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency, with complicated cases carrying an increased risk of infections and morbidity. Whilst preoperative antibiotics help reduce infections, the optimal postoperative regimen remains undefined. Variability exists in antibiotic choice, route and duration. This review aimed to examine recent evidence on postoperative antibiotic stewardship for complicated appendicitis to guide optimal treatment strategies. A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and registered in the PROSPERO registry. A search on PubMed and Cochrane library databases identified studies on postoperative antibiotic use in appendicectomy. Two independent reviewers screened studies, including RCTs, cohort studies and observational studies. Data extraction covered study characteristics, interventions and outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using RoB 2 and ROBINS-I, with GRADE used to evaluate evidence certainty. This review included 11 studies with 8361 participants. Shorter intravenous antibiotic courses (2-6 days) were found to be non-inferior to longer regimens in preventing infections and reducing hospital stays. Risk factors for prolonged antibiotic use included disease severity and surgical complexity. In selected patients, oral antibiotics were shown to be equally effective. Shorter intravenous antibiotic courses and early transition to oral antibiotics effectively managed complicated appendicitis, reducing hospital stays and healthcare costs without increasing complications. Individualised treatment decisions based on patient risk factors and intraoperative findings are essential. Tailoring antibiotic regimens to individual patient characteristics remains crucial. These findings support antibiotic stewardship efforts and highlight the need for further research, particularly in high-risk populations."

    "abstract": "Two geriatric (>9 years old) dogs presented with vomiting, depression, and anorexia and were diagnosed with extrahepatic biliary obstruction (EHBO) secondary to ruptured gallbladder mucoceles. Diagnosis was based on serum biochemical analysis, abdominal radiography, and ultrasonography, which revealed gallbladder rupture, peritonitis, and common bile duct dilation. Both dogs underwent emergency surgical intervention involving cholecystectomy and choledochal stent placement in the common bile duct without cholecystojejunostomy or cholecystoduodenostomy. Postoperatively, the clinical symptoms and serum chemistry values improved, and both dogs survived without recurrence for over one year. These cases demonstrate that choledochal stenting can be an effective adjunct to cholecystectomy for managing EHBO in dogs with ruptured gallbladder mucoceles, potentially preventing reocclusion and promoting recovery, especially when histopathological evaluation is not feasible in clinical settings. However, persistent elevation of liver enzymes may occur postoperatively, necessitating prolonged monitoring and medical management in some cases."

    "abstract": "Background and Clinical Significance: Pylephlebitis is a suppurative thrombophlebitis of porto-mesenteric veins. It is a rare complication of intraabdominal infection or inflammation. Case Presentation: A 46-year-old female patient presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with a three-day history of subfebrile body temperature (37.5 °C) and dull pain in the right lower abdominal quadrant propagating to the left lower quadrant, with frequent bowel movements and liquid stool consistency. Inflammatory markers were elevated. Following transabdominal ultrasound, possible diagnoses were inflammatory changes of the appendix or sigmoid colon. She was given oral antibiotics and discharged home with a surgical follow-up the next morning. The next day, due to the worsening of the symptoms, surgery was performed with no additional imaging studies. Intraoperative findings were diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon with perforation and peritoneal inflammation, and primary anastomosis with a diverting ileosotomy was performed. The patient was discharged from the hospital after seven days with completed antibiotic treatment. Twelve days later, the patient presented to the ED with a two-day fever (38 °C), elevated inflammatory markers and imaging findings consistent with pylephlebitis: complete left portal vein thrombosis, partial thrombosis of the segmental branch of the right portal vein and thrombosis of the inferior mesenteric vein. The administration of anticoagulants and antibiotics started and after nine days she was discharged home. Conclusions: Timely treatment is a necessity in patients with diverticulitis to prevent complications. Furthermore, clinicians and radiologists should be familiar with vascular complications of diverticulitis because their detection and the following treatment can prevent more extensive disease."

    "abstract": "Peritoneal fibrosis (PF) is a major complication of long-term peritoneal dialysis, leading to ultrafiltration failure and technique dropout, highlighting the urgent need for therapies that can preserve peritoneal membrane function and longevity. The present study evaluated the effectiveness of dulaglutide in preserving the functional integrity and durability of the peritoneum while inhibiting PF. In vitro Met-5A cells showed significant upregulation of inflammatory, oxidative stress, intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), fibrotic, intracellular cytoskeletal, apoptotic and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) biomarkers, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), following stimulation with a uremic toxin (p-Cresol), PF inducer [chlorhexidine gluconate (CG)] or endotoxin [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)]. Notably, these effects were significantly suppressed by dulaglutide or TGF-β/DPP4 double silencing. Furthermore, cell viability and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) expression displayed an opposite pattern to ROS among the groups. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into the following groups: i) Sham control (SC); ii) chronic kidney disease (CKD); iii) CKD + CG (mimicking renal failure and PF); and iv) CKD + CG + dulaglutide, and were euthanized by day 42. At this time point, the highest levels of peritoneal protein expression levels of oxidative stress (NOX-1, NOX-2 and DPP4), inflammation (NF-κB and TNF-α), angiogenesis (CD31 and von Willebrand factor) and EMT (TGF-β, Snail, β-catenin, vimentin, phosphorylated-Smad3, α-smooth muscle actin, collagen I, N-cadherin and fibronectin) factors; and cellular expression levels of fibrosis and inflammation markers, were observed in the CKD + CG group, the lowest were detected in the SC group, and the levels were significantly reduced in the CKD + CG + dulaglutide group compared with those in the CKD group. Furthermore, the expression levels of antioxidant proteins (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 and GLP-1 receptor) exhibited an opposite trend to ROS-associated proteins among the groups. Additional Sprague-Dawley rats were categorized into the following groups: i) SC; ii) LPS-induced peritonitis; iii) LPS-induced peritonitis + dulaglutide, and were euthanized by day 5 after peritonitis induction. At this time point, flow cytometry revealed significantly increased levels of inflammatory cells (CD11b/c+, myeloperoxidase+ and Ly6G+ cells) in the circulation and abdominal fluid, and increased peritoneal permeability in the LPS-induced peritonitis group compared with those in the SC group; these levels were significantly reversed in the LPS-induced peritonitis + dulaglutide group. In conclusion, dulaglutide may effectively maintain peritoneal integrity primarily by suppressing inflammation, oxidative stress, EMT and fibrosis."

    "title": "Diverticulitis: A Review.",
    "abstract": "Diverticulosis is defined by the presence of multiple outpouchings (diverticula) originating from the intestinal lumen. Diverticulitis is defined as inflammation of these diverticula. The annual incidence of diverticulitis in the US is approximately 180 per 100 000 people, resulting in approximately 200 000 hospital admissions annually and an estimated health care expenditure of more than $6.3 billion/year. Risk factors for diverticular disease include age older than 65 years, genetic factors such as variant in the tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 15 (TNFSFI5) gene; connective tissue diseases such as polycystic kidney disease, Marfan syndrome, or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; body mass index 30 or greater; use of opioids, steroids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications; hypertension; and type 2 diabetes. Approximately 1% to 4% of patients with diverticulosis will develop acute diverticulitis in their lifetime, which typically presents as left lower quadrant pain associated with nausea, vomiting, fever, and leukocytosis. A contrast-enhanced abdominal and pelvic computed tomography scan is the recommended diagnostic test and has a sensitivity of 98% to 99% and specificity of 99% to 100%. Approximately 85% of people with acute diverticulitis have uncomplicated diverticulitis (absence of abscess, colon strictures, colon perforation, or fistula formation). Management of patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis consists of observation with pain management (typically acetaminophen) and dietary modification with a clear liquid diet. Antibiotics should be reserved for patients with systemic symptoms such as persistent fever or chills, those with increasing leukocytosis, those older than 80 years, those who are pregnant, those who are immunocompromised (receiving chemotherapy, or high-dose steroids, or have received an organ transplant), and those with chronic medical conditions (such as cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, or poorly controlled diabetes). First-line antibiotics consist of oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or cefalexin with metronidazole. For patients who cannot tolerate oral intake, intravenous antibiotic therapy (ie, cefuroxime or ceftriaxone plus metronidazole or ampicillin/sulbactam) is appropriate. Complicated diverticulitis is managed with intravenous antibiotics such as ceftriaxone plus metronidazole or piperacillin-tazobactam and additional invasive management as indicated (ie, percutaneous drainage of associated intra-abdominal abscess or colon resection). Patients with generalized peritonitis should undergo emergent laparotomy with colonic resection. Postoperative mortality for diverticulitis managed electively or emergently is 0.5% for elective colon resection and 10.6% for emergent colon resection. In the US, diverticulitis affects approximately 180 per 100 000 people annually. For uncomplicated diverticulitis, first-line therapy is observation and pain control, and antibiotics should be initiated for patients with persistent fevers, increasing leukocytosis, sepsis or septic shock, advanced age, pregnancy, immunocompromise, and certain chronic medical conditions. Treatment of complicated diverticulitis includes intravenous antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone plus metronidazole or piperacillin-tazobactam, and, if indicated, percutaneous drainage of abscess or resection of diseased segment of colon."

In total, 12 patients (70.7%) had Lugano stage I disease. The mean TS of the patients was 39 months (range: 32–46). The TS of the patients with B-cell lymphoma was higher than T-cell lymphoma (B-cell lymphoma 27 months vs. T-cell lymphoma 8 months, P = 0.018). The median DFS was 41 months (range: 33–49). The DFS of patients with B-cell lymphoma was higher than T-cell lymphoma (27 months vs. 6 months. P = 0.019). Emergency surgery due to complications in patients with primary intestinal lymphoma does not have negative predictive value on their survival.

    "abstract": "Colo-colic intussusception is a surgical emergency in which a part of the intestine slides into the distal adjacent part. Transverse sigmoid intussusception is a rare serious clinical condition requiring immediate surgical intervention. We present a 6-year-old female with intermittent abdominal pain, watery bloody stool and obstipation. Digital rectal examination revealed a firm tender mass; finger showed a current jelly stool. The ultrasound showed a donut sign and underwent a laparotomy and the postoperative recovery was uneventful. All children with imprecise signs and symptoms, especially presenting with bloody mucus stool, can be mistaken for gastroenteritis, have high risk of perforation. They must be considered as surgical cases until proven otherwise."

    "abstract": "Amyand's hernia (AH), an extremely rare form of inguinal hernia, particularly those cases where the hernial sac contains an inflamed, edematous, or perforated appendix, is infrequently encountered. This report details the case of a 6-year-old boy who presented with an irreducible, painful mass in the right inguinal region of unknown etiology. A CT scan indicated right inguinal hernia, and a blood routine test revealed elevated white blood cell counts. The patient was diagnosed with right inguinal hernia (AH) and acute appendicitis. Emergency laparoscopic high ligation of the inguinal hernia sac and appendectomy were performed. A postoperative pathological examination confirmed acute simple appendicitis and periappendicitis. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged 5 days after surgery. With a 6-month follow-up, no recurrence was observed, and the patient remains under follow-up. In conclusion, AH is a rare condition, and laparoscopic high ligation of the hernial sac is the primary treatment approach. During surgery, careful identification of the hernia contents is essential. Comprehensive preoperative assessment, precise surgical techniques, and standardized intraoperative and postoperative management play a vital role in minimizing complications and reducing the risk of postoperative recurrence."

    "abstract": "Postoperative complications remain a significant concern in pediatric emergency abdominal surgery. However, reliable predictors to anticipate these adverse events are lacking in the pediatric population. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for postoperative complications in children undergoing emergency abdominal surgery. Following the approval by our institutional ethics committee, we conducted a prospective study from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2024, in a pediatric surgery department. All children under 14 years of age who underwent emergency abdominal surgery were included. A total of 582 patients were included. The median age was 9 years, and 66.7% were male. Acute appendicitis was the most common surgical condition (n = 515), followed by intussusception (n = 15), ovarian torsion (n = 14), and complicated Meckel's diverticulum (n = 10). Postoperative complications occurred in 12.4% of cases. These complications included surgical site infection (n = 35), adhesive small bowel obstruction (n = 13), postoperative sepsis (n = 8), intra-abdominal abscess (n = 7), respiratory infections (n = 4), urinary tract infections (n = 3), and prolonged postoperative bleeding (n = 2). On multivariate analysis, four independent predictive factors of postoperative complications were identified: symptom duration > 48 h, pediatric comorbidity index ≥ 3, white blood cell count > 15 × 109/l, and operative time > 100 min. Systematic assessment of these risk factors may contribute to early risk stratification, guide postoperative monitoring decisions, and justify the use of more aggressive or prolonged antibiotic therapy in selected high-risk patients."

    "abstract": "Emergency colorectal surgery traditionally employs open approaches, with limited minimally invasive adoption. While robotic surgery demonstrates benefits in elective procedures, its role in emergency settings remains unclear. This retrospective study evaluated outcomes of robotic versus laparoscopic and open approaches in emergency colorectal procedures and predicted future adoption trends. We analyzed 83,483 patients from the ACS-NSQIP database (2012-2021) who underwent emergency colorectal surgery: 53,731 open, 26,649 laparoscopic, and 3,103 robotic procedures. Outcomes were examined using multivariable regression, propensity score matching, and g-computation analysis. Classification and Regression Trees (CART) were employed to analyze surgical approach selection factors, while Vector Autoregressive models projected future utilization trends. Robotic surgery demonstrated significantly lower conversion rates to open surgery compared to laparoscopy (7.8% vs 24.2%; adjusted OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.28-0.36), shorter length of stay (IRR 0.67, 95% CI 0.65-0.69), and fewer surgical complications (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.60-0.72). Robotic utilization increased from 0% to 6.6% (2012-2021), with trends suggesting substantial growth toward 20.2% by 2025. Patient selection favored robotics for stable patients with diverticulitis (68.4%) and cancer without sepsis, while open surgery remained predominant for patients with perforation, severe sepsis, or significant comorbidities. In selected emergency colorectal procedures, robotic surgery demonstrates superior outcomes versus conventional approaches. These outcomes may be partially influenced by patient selection factors, as robotic cases involved more clinically stable patients. These findings support expanded robotic platform availability for emergency procedures, though careful patient selection remains essential. The projected increase in robotic utilization reflects growing acceptance of this technology, suggesting that its technical advantages may extend to more complex emergency cases than previously considered."

    "abstract": "Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a high-risk endoscopic procedure. We recently found that physician-initiated post-ERCP follow-up calls on day 7 post-ERCP increased adverse event capture. Subsequently, we prospectively evaluated the utility of nurse-initiated follow-up calls, comparing these with physician-initiated calls to assess the impact of transitioning this responsibility to a nurse. This prospective study was conducted on consecutive patients undergoing ERCP at our academic tertiary care medical center. Patients received phone calls on days 1 and 7 post-ERCP, from either an endoscopist or a nurse coordinator, using a standardized script to assess delayed complications (pancreatitis, non-pancreatitis abdominal pain, bleeding, infection, perforation), and unplanned health encounters. A total of 448 ERCP patients (239 physician calls, 209 nursing calls) were included. Physician calls were more successful than nursing calls in reaching patients on both day 1 (96% vs. 74%, P<0.001) and day 7 (91% vs. 63%, P<0.001). Nursing calls were significantly longer than physician calls on both days. A higher adverse event capture rate by physician calls compared to nursing calls was evident on day 1 (3.5% vs. 2.4%, P=0.04) and day 7 (10.6% vs. 6.3%, P=0.004). Physician follow-up calls on day 7 resulted in substantially more patients triaged to the Emergency Department, primary care and oncology clinics (P<0.001). Physician calls were significantly more effective than nurse calls in reaching patients, capturing adverse events, and triaging patients to appropriate care. These data support the value of physician-initiated calls, at least following the most complex procedures."

    "abstract": "A 71-year-old woman was diagnosed with a subacute myocardial infarction caused by an obstruction in the middle segment of the right coronary artery. Two hours after successful percutaneous coronary intervention, bedside transthoracic echocardiography revealed an interventricular septal perforation. Three hours later, the patient developed cardiac tamponade. An emergency pericardiocentesis was performed, which promptly restored hemodynamic stability. Echocardiographic findings suggested oozing from a minor perforation of the postinfarct inferior wall. Subsequent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging identified a basal inferoposterior septal perforation connected with an intramyocardial dissection. After intensive medical management, the patient gradually recovered and was discharged on the 135th day of admission. Five years of follow-up were uneventful with optimal medication therapy. - Ventricular septal perforation following a myocardial infarction can result in intramyocardial dissection, which may extend to the epicardium and eventually lead to cardiac tamponade.- Physicians should individualize treatment strategies for each patient based on various factors, especially in cases with rare and complex post-infarct complications.- Advanced imaging techniques are recommended for assessing complex mechanical complications following a myocardial infarction."

    "abstract": "To assess the efficacy and safety of conservative management with interval appendectomy vs. baseline surgery in the treatment of appendiceal phlegmon. A retrospective study of the 76 phlegmons treated from July 2016 to June 2024 was carried out. Two treatment groups were created -the baseline surgery (G1: 46 children) group and the conservative with interval appendectomy (G2: 30 children) group. Clinical and progression characteristics of both groups were collected and compared. No significant differences were found in terms of age, progression time, presence of appendicolith, or mean hospital stay. The number of intra-abdominal collections at diagnosis was greater in G2 (21.7% vs. 56.6%; p< 0.05), and the percentage of complications was significantly higher in G1 (54.34% vs. 20%; p< 0.002). In G2, 3 collection drainage procedures were carried out, and 4 children underwent surgery in an acute stage as a result of treatment failure. Following discharge, 2 patients from G2 underwent emergency surgery, 4 refused surgery, and 20 underwent surgery after 184 ± 55 days. Of the latter, 2 had complications. 89.47% of the appendices removed had histological disorders. Conservative treatment of appendiceal phlegmon is safe and effective. It significantly reduces morbidity, and it is not contraindicated by age, presence of appendicolith, or intra-abdominal collections. However, large collection drainage procedures may be required. We believe interval appendectomy is indicated in a period of 3-6 months.

Estudio retrospectivo de los 76 plastrones tratados entre julio de 2016 y junio de 2024. Se dividieron en dos grupos de tratamiento: quirúrgico inicial (G1: 46 niños) y conservador con apendicectomía diferida (G2: 30 niños) y se recogieron y compararon las características clínicas y evolutivas de ambos grupos. No se hallaron diferencias significativas en la edad, tiempo de evolución, presencia de apendicolito ni estancia media. Se encontraron más colecciones intraabdominales al diagnóstico en el G2 (21,7% vs 56,6%; p< 0,05) y un porcentaje de complicaciones significativamente mayor en el G1 (54,34% vs 20%; p< 0,002). En G2 se realizaron tres procedimientos de drenaje de colecciones y cuatro niños fueron intervenidos en fase aguda por fracaso del tratamiento. Tras el alta dos pacientes del G2 fueron intervenidos de Urgencia, cuatro rechazaron la intervención y veinte fueron intervenidos tras 184 ± 55 días. De estos últimos, 2 presentaron complicaciones. El 89,47% de los apéndices extirpados presentaron alteraciones histológicas. El tratamiento conservador de los plastrones apendiculares es seguro y eficaz y disminuye de forma significativa la morbilidad. Ni la edad, ni la presencia de apendicolito o colecciones intraabdominales contraindica el manejo conservador, aunque pueden ser necesarios procedimientos para el drenaje de grandes colecciones. Consideramos indicada la apendicectomía diferida en un plazo de 3-6 meses."

Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) sometimes present with severe abdominal pain as the first symptom, which may be misdiagnosed. We report a case of PCI in a patient with diabetes mellitus (DM) misdiagnosed as gastrointestinal perforation and underwent exploratory laparotomy. A 41-year-old woman with a history of DM treated with miglitol, an α-glucosidase inhibitors (αGI), was admitted to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain. Computed tomography revealed thickening of the ascending colon wall and scattered free gas around it, and the possibility of tumor perforation was considered. The patient was diagnosed with gastrointestinal perforation and DM but was revised to PCI and DKA after surgery. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy; however, no signs of digestive perforation were found. The patient developed DKA after surgery and received conservative treatment, including antibiotics, insulin, fluid support, oxygen therapy, and cessation of miglitol. Ketoacidosis was controlled, and the abdominal pain resolved with conservative treatment. She was discharged 16 days later and no longer required αGI therapy. She did not develop gastrointestinal symptoms or any signs of PCI on computed tomography imaging within 3 months. PCI is a rare disease with great heterogeneity in etiology, treatment and prognosis and comorbidities like diabetes may increase the chances of misdiagnosis. Surgeons should pay attention to the patient's medical history and examination and carefully identify the real disease that triggers the symptoms to avoid misdiagnosis."

While traditionally managed with a two-stage surgical approach, recent reports suggest that one-stage, minimally invasive approaches may be feasible. We present the case of a 13-month-old female who developed bile duct perforation associated with a protein plug in the common channel. Following the correction of coagulopathy, emergency robotic surgery was performed, including bile duct excision and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. Despite significant adhesions and an anatomical anomaly in which the right hepatic artery coursed anterior to the common hepatic duct, robotic dissection and reconstruction were safely completed. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged. This report highlights the feasibility and potential advantages of one-stage robotic surgery for CBD with perforation, even in the presence of active inflammation and vascular anomalies. Similar cases must be reported and evaluated to understand the indications and limitations of this approach."

We aimed to evaluate the outcomes of patients with perforated appendicitis when treated with Piperacillin-Tazobactam (PT) monotherapy versus Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole (CM) dual-drug therapy. We hypothesized that there is no difference in the rate of intraabdominal abscess (IAA) formation with antibiotic monotherapy, as opposed to our institutional standard dual-drug therapy. Single institution retrospective review of children < 18 years old with perforated appendicitis from October 2019 to March 2020 and October 2021 to May 2022 at a free-standing pediatric hospital. The primary outcome was 30-day postoperative IAA formation. One hundred and seventeen patients were identified during the study periods; N = 77 in the CM group and N = 40 in the PT group. No differences in symptom duration, postoperative length of stay (LOS), duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment, or discharge oral antibiotic treatment were identified. Compared to the PT group, those treated with CM had fewer IAA (13% vs 20%, P = 0.32) and fewer emergency room visits (14.3% vs 27.5%, P = 0.08) but did not have statistically significant differences. Multivariate logistic regression analysis did not find antibiotic choice to be a significant predictor for developing IAA [OR 1.78, P = 0.21]. In children with perforated appendicitis, postoperative monotherapy with PT and standard dual-drug therapy with CM are equivalent with respect to IAA formation at our institution."

This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic utility of selected inflammatory ratios and nutritional scores in differentiating AMI from other causes of acute abdominal pain. This retrospective, single-center study included 40 patients diagnosed with AMI and 40 control patients who presented with non-specific abdominal pain and had no definitive diagnosis. Preoperative laboratory parameters obtained upon emergency admission were analyzed. Calculated indices included neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), C-reactive protein (CRP)-to-albumin ratio (CAR), and CRP-to-LDH ratio (CLDR), among others. Group comparisons, Pearson correlation analyses, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed. Compared to controls, AMI patients showed significantly elevated levels of NLR, PLR, SII, CAR, and CLDR, and significantly lower levels of PNI (p<0.05). ROC analysis revealed that SII [area under the curve (AUC) =0.89], NLR (AUC =0.86), and PNI (AUC =0.81) demonstrated the strongest diagnostic performance. Several indices were found to be strongly correlated, Including NLR with SII and CAR with CLDR. The observed mortality rate in the AMI group was 52.5%. Inflammatory and nutritional markers, particularly SII, NLR, and PNI, appear to offer valuable diagnostic support in identifying AMI. These indices may help prioritize patients for advanced imaging and early intervention, especially in resource-limited emergency settings. Further prospective multicenter studies are needed to confirm their clinical utility."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is one of the most common causes of abdominal pain in children and is considered the most frequent paediatric surgical emergency. The incidence progresses from extremely low in the neonatal period to a peak incidence between ages 12 and 18 years. Prompt diagnosis and management are imperative to prevent serious complications such as perforation, peritonitis, intra-abdominal abscess formation and bowel obstruction. Laparoscopy has improved intra- and post-operative outcomes for children with appendicitis. This study was conducted to evaluate demographics and complications of laparoscopic appendicectomy in Indian children. This is a retrospective cohort study encompassing 714 consecutive patients of appendicitis operated over 15 years (2006-2021) by a single surgeon at a high-volume private paediatric surgical centre in Western India. Data collected included age and gender, duration of surgery and post-operative variables such as length of stay and early or delayed interventions, if any. The patients were categorised into two groups: complicated appendicitis and non-complicated appendicitis, depending on the operative findings. Patients with acutely inflamed appendix without perforation, peritonitis or collection and patients with chronically inflamed appendix were categorised as non-complicated appendicitis. Patients with perforated or gangrenous appendicitis, appendicular lump and appendicitis with intraperitoneal collection were categorised as complicated appendicitis. Additional pathologies found and treated during the surgery were also documented. The statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 28.0.0.0. The total cohort of patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy in the study was 714. The number of male patients was significantly greater than the female population (P < 0.001). The total number of cases of non-complicated appendicitis was 580 (81.23%). Patients with uncomplicated appendicitis had a mean age of 9.12 ± 3.65 years, while those with complicated appendicitis had a mean age of 7.49 ± 3.58 years. Additional pathologies such as simple ovarian cyst, Meckel's diverticulum and Enterobius vermicularis were found in 11.55% of uncomplicated cases. Post-operative complications were observed to be higher in the complicated group (27.6%) compared to the uncomplicated group (1.72%). This study shows that acute appendicitis affects our study population at a mean age of 8.84 years, with a majority of males (64.14%). It also shows that complicated appendicitis has a higher incidence of post-operative complications of 27.6% and prolonged hospital stay. A multicentre research across various states in India can help establish a clear outlook regarding the demographics of complicated and uncomplicated paediatric appendicitis in the country."

    "abstract": "Perforation peritonitis remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in emergency surgical patients. Conventionally, open laparotomy has been the preferred approach. However, with advancements in minimally invasive techniques, laparoscopic management has emerged as a potential alternative. The study aims to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of laparoscopic surgery compared to open laparotomy in managing perforation peritonitis. A prospective observational study was conducted from January 2022 to May 2023 for patients diagnosed with perforation peritonitis. A total of 140 patients were recruited, 110 patients underwent laparotomy while 30 patients underwent laparoscopic management. Propensity score matching (PSM) in 1:1 ratio was applied to balance confounding variables, resulting in two matched groups of 28 patients each. Operative time, length of post-operative stay, post-operative Visual Analogue Scale score, morbidity and mortality rates were compared. The mean operative time was significantly longer in the laparoscopic group (217.43 ± 86.10 min) compared to the laparotomy group (182.46 ± 31.63 min; P = 0.049). However, patients in the laparoscopic group experienced a significantly shorter hospital stay (4.39 ± 2.04 days vs. 8.68 ± 3.45 days; P < 0.001) and lower post-operative pain scores at all time points (P < 0.012). The 30-day morbidity rate was lower in the laparoscopic group (10% vs. 32%), with fewer surgical site infections and reoperations. Laparoscopy is a feasible and effective alternative to laparotomy in selected cases of perforation peritonitis, offering benefits such as reduced post-operative pain and shorter hospital stay. Despite technical challenges, improved surgical expertise and patient selection can enhance its role in emergency surgical settings."

    "abstract": "Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are widely used but carry rare risks of migration and subsequent complications, such as bowel obstruction. This case highlights the life-threatening potential of chronic IUD migration decades after insertion, emphasizing the need for heightened clinical vigilance and long-term surveillance. A 57-year-old female patient presented to the hospital with a 2-day history of abdominal pain, accompanied by the cessation of flatus and defecation. She had one pregnancy and one vaginal delivery 31 years ago, followed by the insertion of a ring-shaped IUD 1 year postpartum. However, she had not undergone any follow-up examinations since the IUD placement. Two years prior to admission, she attempted to have the IUD removed, but it was not detected within the uterine cavity. This resulted in the assumption that the device had been spontaneously expelled, and no further investigations were pursued at that time. CT imaging revealed small bowel obstruction and a ring-shaped intra-abdominal foreign body. Emergency laparotomy identified a migrated IUD strangulating 100 cm of necrotic ileum. Upon exploration of the uterus, a fibroid was identified on the posterior wall, but no acute perforations or other pathological changes were noted. Subsequently, the IUD was removed, and bowel resection with anastomosis was performed. Chronic IUD migration may evade detection for decades, culminating in catastrophic bowel obstruction. Clinicians must maintain high suspicion for IUD-related complications in patients with abdominal pain, even years after insertion. Prophylactic removal of misplaced devices and long-term imaging surveillance are critical to prevent morbidity. Early recognition of such rare but severe complications through comprehensive clinical assessment and imaging studies can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce the risk of life - threatening bowel - related events."

The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical features of adult patients with esophageal foreign bodies, examine different endoscopic management strategies for esophageal foreign bodies, summarize the experience of Department of Gastroenterology of Henan Provincial People's Hospital in the treatment of esophageal foreign bodies, and ultimately improve the success rate of foreign body removal. The medical records of 275 adult patients with esophageal foreign bodies successfully treated under endoscopy at the Department of Gastroenterology of Henan Provincial People's Hospital from January 2017 to August 2023 were retrospectively reviewed. Among the 275 patients, 210 patients had no underlying esophageal diseases, while 65 experienced esophageal stricture due to variety of reasons. In the 210 patients, sharp objects were the predominant foreign bodies in the esophagus. The most common location of esophageal foreign bodies was the upper segment, followed by the middle and lower segments. Among the 65 patients with esophageal strictures, the types of esophageal foreign bodies included large food bolus, vegetable pieces, meat chunks, and tablets. Foreign body forceps, snares, and biopsy forceps were the instruments most frequently used to manage these bodies. There were statistically significant differences in the impaction time between different age groups (P<0.05). Of the 275 patients, 20 had esophageal perforation, while the remaining patients showed various degrees of congestion, erosion, or ulceration during endoscopy. Older adult patients were more likely to experience prolonged impaction. Endoscopic removal of esophageal foreign bodies is safe and effective. An appropriate strategy based on the size, type, and location is needed in order to remove foreign bodies and ensure successful removal, reduce risk, and avoid surgical interventions, especially in cases of complex foreign bodies."

Furthermore, we aimed to analyze the association between opioid prescriptions at discharge and emergency department (ED) visits and readmissions in this patient cohort. The NSQIP-P database was queried for all patients under 18 years of age who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for simple or complicated appendicitis in 2023. Patients were stratified based on whether they received an opioid prescription at discharge. Demographics, clinical characteristics and postoperative outcomes were compared between patients receiving opioid prescriptions versus those who did not. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of opioid prescribing and its association with ED visits and unplanned readmissions. Among 22,148 pediatric appendectomy patients, 5.2 % received opioids at discharge. In patients with simple appendicitis, older age (p < 0.001), male sex (p = 0.027), Black/African American race (p = 0.012), computed tomography (CT) without ultrasound (p < 0.001) and shorter hospital stay (p = 0.002) were independent predictors of opioid prescription. In cases of complicated appendicitis, independent predictors of opioid prescription included older age (p = 0.001), CT without ultrasound (p < 0.001) and shorter hospital stay (p < 0.001). Discharge opioids were associated with increased odds of ED visits (aOR 1.28, 95 % CI: 1.00-1.60), but not unplanned readmissions (aOR 1.13, CI 95 %: 0.75-1.64). Despite declining national rates, variation in opioid prescribing following appendectomy persists. Poor radiation stewardship and patient demographics appear to be associated with prescribing patterns. Efforts to optimize pain management and reduce unnecessary opioid exposure are warranted.

    "abstract": "Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) represents a vascular emergency in which the accurate delineation of surgical margins during laparotomy is pivotal for optimizing patient outcomes. The current diagnostic limitations underscore the need for a noninvasive, real-time modality capable of precisely identifying viable intestinal tissue to mitigate postoperative complications such as short bowel syndrome and sepsis. This study investigates the efficacy of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) in assessing intestinal viability and accurately guiding resection margins during laparotomy procedures for AMI. Intraoperative diffuse reflectance spectral data were collected from healthy, ischemic, and anastomotic segments of the intestine in a cohort of seven patients. Hemoglobin absorption spectra were analyzed to calculate the absorption ratio at 577 nm-560 nm (A(577)/A(560)), serving as an indicator of tissue oxygen saturation. The percentage decrease in oxygenation between healthy and ischemic tissues (ΔStO2%) was subsequently quantified and correlated with histopathological findings to determine the optimal margins for surgical resection. A significant correlation was observed between ΔStO2% values and histopathological Chiu scores, effectively discriminating between ischemic and nonischemic intestinal tissues (P = 0.001). A ΔStO2% threshold of 12.3 ± 2.6% was identified as the critical value for defining surgical resection margins, corresponding to a Chiu score of 2, indicating the necessity for tissue excision. DRS has demonstrated significant potential as an intraoperative adjunct in the real-time determination of resection margins during AMI surgeries. By providing objective and quantifiable parameters, DRS has the potential to enhance clinical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes."

    "abstract": "The high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and the phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) have been demonstrated to enhance endotoxin elimination and inactivation in animal models of sepsis. This study aimed to confirm such a role in patients presenting with abdominal sepsis undergoing emergent surgery and explore the relationships between HDL, PLTP and the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) burden (mass and activity). Patients operated for abdominal sepsis were prospectively included in the study. Blood samples were obtained before surgery, at the end of the operation (H0), 4 h (H4) and 24 h (H24) later. Peritoneal fluid was also sampled. HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, PLTP activity, LPS mass and activity were measured. Twenty-seven patients were included. At H0, LPS mass was mostly measured in the lipoprotein fractions (46% [23; 58] in HDL and 36% [29; 54] in LDL). Overall, LPS mass and LPS activity did not decrease in the 24 h following admission to the ICU. Both HDLc concentrations and PLTP activity were associated with increased H4-LPS elimination (drop in LPS concentration, -3% [-26;10] vs. 29% [13;52], p < 0.01 and -2% [-15;10] vs. 20% [8:52], p = 0.03, respectively). Increased H4-LPS elimination was associated with reduced inflammation (plasma cytokine concentration) and mortality. High HDL cholesterol was associated with reduced mortality but not with inflammation. Our data support the role of HDL and PLTP in the elimination of LPS during human peritonitis with sepsis. Increased H4-LPS elimination was associated with reduced inflammation and lower mortality. gov: NCT04126577."

    "abstract": "The ongoing shortage of medical personnel highlights the urgent need to automate clinical documentation and reduce administrative burden. Large vision-language models (VLMs) offer promising potential for supporting surgical documentation and intraoperative analysis. We conducted an observational, comparative performance study of two general-purpose VLMs - GPT-4o (OpenAI) and Gemini-1.5-pro (Google) - from June to September 2024, using 15 cholecystectomy and 15 appendectomy videos (1 fps) from the CholecT45 and LapApp datasets. Tasks included object detection (vessel clips, gauze, retrieval bags, bleeding), surgery type classification, appendicitis grading, and surgical report generation. In-context learning (ICL) was evaluated as an enhancement method. Performance was assessed using descriptive accuracy metrics. Both models identified vessel clips with 100% accuracy. GPT-4o outperformed Gemini-1.5-pro in retrieval bag (100% vs. 93.3%) and gauze detection (93.3% vs. 60%), while Gemini-1.5-pro showed better results in bleeding detection (93.3% vs. 86.7%). In surgery classification, Gemini-1.5-pro was more accurate for cholecystectomies (93% vs. 80%), with both models achieving 60% accuracy for appendectomies. Appendicitis grading showed limited performance (GPT-4o: 40%, Gemini-1.5-pro: 26.7%). For surgical reports, GPT-4o produced for CCE more complete outputs (CCE: 90.4%, APE: 80.1%), while Gemini-1.5-pro achieved higher correctness overall (CCE: 71.1%, APE: 69.6%). ICL notably improved tool recognition (e.g., in APE step 4, GPT-4o improved from 69.2% to 80%), though its effect on organ removal step recognition was inconsistent. GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-pro performed reliably in object detection and procedure classification but showed limitations in grading pathology and accurately describing procedural steps, which could be enhanced through in-context learning. This shows that domain-agnostic VLMs can be applied to surgical video analysis. In the future, VLMs with domain knowledge can be envisioned to enhance the operating room in the form of companions."

It tends to metastasize to various organs, including the lungs, brain, bones and, less commonly, the small bowel. This case report describes a 74-year-old woman who had small bowel metastasis leading to obstruction three years after diagnosis and local resection of ATC, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. The patient presented at the emergency department with abdominal pain and vomiting. A CT-scan of the abdomen showed signs of intestinal perforation, combined with diffuse dilatation of the ileal small bowel, for which a segmental enterectomy was performed. Histological findings of the resected small bowel diagnosed the tumor as a jejunal metastasis of an ATC. The morphology of this lesion was compared to that of this patient's ATC. We present a rare case of small bowel metastasis from ATC which has previously been described in just a few case reports in the medical literature. Therefore, this case report contributes to the limited knowledge available on this condition."

This is a case report of a 34-year-old female patient, who presented to the emergency department with clinical symptoms suggestive of acute appendicitis like right iliac fossa pain, vomiting and nausea. After an inconclusive ultrasound, a CT scan was performed, which revealed a hypermobile cecum with volvulus. An emergency laparoscopy was performed, during which both a successful cecopexy and appendectomy were carried out. The patient recovered well post-operatively and was discharged on the fourth post-operative day. This case highlights the need for radiological imaging and the diagnostic difficulty caused by a hypermobile cecum, since it can resemble other common acute surgical situations. CT imaging is critical for precise diagnosis, and early surgical intervention is key to preventing complications such as perforation.

Recent studies have shown excellent diagnostic performance of rapid MRI for acute appendicitis. As MRI becomes more prevalent in the evaluation of right lower quadrant pain, its use for gynecologic indications should be reevaluated. A retrospective review of patients who had rapid MRI examinations performed in the emergency department (ED) for right lower quadrant pain at a single institution was conducted from August 2022 through August 2023. A time-matched control group with US evaluation for the same indication was obtained. A rapid, non-contrast three-sequence free-breathing MRI protocol was utilized. Of the 376 rapid MRI exams performed for the indication of right lower quadrant pain, 49 were noted to have gynecologic pathology identified. Of the 250 time-matched US controls, 51 were noted to have gynecologic pathology. The median MRI scan time (first image to last image) was 10 minutes. The total length of stay in the ED was significantly shorter in the rapid MRI group than in the controls (median 338 minutes vs 442 minutes, P < .05). Time to imaging diagnosis was significantly shorter in the rapid MRI group (201 minutes vs 285 minutes, P < .01). Time to gynecology consultation was not significantly different between groups (238 minutes vs 253 minutes, P = .66). First-line, rapid MRI for evaluation of gynecologic processes can provide imaging diagnoses faster than using US and results in lower overall lengths of stay in the ED."

    "abstract": "Non-operative management (NOM) for simple acute appendicitis is an acceptable alternative to surgery, yet concerns regarding late failure and safety of subsequent appendectomy persist. The risks and complications of appendectomy following failed NOM are not widely reported. This study compares outcomes of early appendectomy and appendectomy after NOM failure in children. A retrospective cohort study of 136 children aged 5-18 years diagnosed with simple acute appendicitis between 2019 and 2021. Upon initial diagnosis, parents chose between early appendectomy and NOM. Group A included children undergoing early appendectomy (n = 91). Group B included children with failed NOM requiring subsequent appendectomy (n = 45). Age and gender were comparable between the groups (p > 0.05). Group A had significantly higher odds of post-operative complications compared to Group B (OR = 3.03, p = 0.036). Mean post-operative hospital stay was one day shorter in Group B (p = 0.004). Post-operative emergency department (ED) visits and readmissions were slightly lower in group B (A = 14 % vs. B = 4 %, p = 0.085 and A = 8 % vs. B = 0 %, p = 0.056, respectively). As expected, Group B required longer total antibiotic therapy (intravenous and oral) (diff = 10.8 days, p < 0.001) and more imaging studies (diff = 1.1, p < 0.001). Appendectomy following NOM failure in children with appendicitis resulted in fewer post-operative complications and shorter post-operative hospitalizations compared to early appendectomy. Our findings suggest that NOM may be a safe and viable initial management strategy for children with simple appendicitis, as appendectomy is safe for those who complete the initial NOM protocol and will eventually require an appendectomy.

Few cases of pediatric PUK have been reported, making clinical guidelines rare. Case report. A 13-year-old female with Trisomy 21 and well-controlled Graves' Disease and no history of ocular trauma presented with ten days of right eye pain refractory to treatment with topical antibiotics and corticosteroids. Visual acuity was count fingers and slit lamp examination showed marked conjunctival injection, as well as a fibrin band in the anterior chamber. Corneal examination demonstrated substantial inferior peripheral stromal thinning and overlying epithelial defect concerning for PUK, prompting hospital admission for management and systemic disease workup. Effusive asymmetric arthritis of the left lower ankle, left knee, and left hand was suspicious for juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and laboratory studies showed elevated CRP and ESR levels. Despite medical treatment with IV methylprednisolone 1000 mg daily and fortified antibiotic eye drops four times per day, a corneal descemetocele formed, prompting urgent surgical intervention. The patient underwent two interventions with amniotic membrane transplantation. Four months after initial presentation, visual acuity in the affected eye had improved to 20/25, same as fellow eye, and slit lamp examination showed corneal re-epithelialization, healed descemetocele, and ocular inflammatory control on methotrexate monotherapy. The final ocular diagnosis was PUK and anterior uveitis secondary to JIA. Based on our clinical course, we recommend early systemic treatment to manage rapidly progressive corneal thinning in pediatric PUK. Early surgical intervention can be considered to avoid perforation."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is the most common abdominal emergency in pediatrics and is suggested as a quality indicator for timely access to care in time-sensitive conditions. Despite advances in diagnostics, the incidence of complicated appendicitis (CA) remains high due to delays in pediatric surgical care, which can increase disease severity. Social vulnerability has been associated with surgical access, particularly in low- and middle-income populations. This study examines the relationship between surgical delay and social determinants of complicated appendicitis in children without social security in the Metropolitan Zone of México. This retrospective cohort study was conducted in a pediatric public hospital. Consecutive cases from 2018 to 2021 with confirmed appendicitis diagnoses were included. The primary outcome variable was the type of appendicitis (acute/complicated), while two independent variables were the time of evolution (patient and hospital timing) and socioeconomic factors associated with social vulnerability. A logistic regression analysis assessed the relationship between appendicitis type and covariates. A total of 943 pediatric cases of appendicitis were included. Out of these, 62.67% presented CA, with a mean age 10 ± 4 years. 60.9% were well-nourished, and 16% had at least one comorbidity. Most subjects (76%) met at least two criteria for social vulnerability, and 74.7% of families held unskilled jobs. The median symptom-to-admission time was 2 days, with a median hospital-to-surgery time of 19.5 h (p25-p75). Prehospital delays affected 57.8% of cases (n = 545), and 39% (n = 365) experienced intrahospital delays. In the multivariable logistic regression, prehospital delay ≥48 h (OR 3.27, 95% CI 2.43-4.39) and children under 5 years (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.09-2.84) were associated with higher odds of CA. The high frequency of CA in uninsured children at a public hospital is due to surgical delays of two or more days. Social vulnerabilities, as observed globally, hinder access to quality care. Thus, appendicitis should be recognized as both a medical and social issue, requiring a comprehensive approach that addresses social vulnerability."

    "abstract": "Acute gastric dilatation (AGD) is a rare but clinically significant condition characterized by abnormal enlargement of the stomach. It can lead to serious complications such as gastric necrosis, perforation, and respiratory failure if not promptly managed. AGD has been associated with mechanical obstructions, binge eating, and systemic conditions like diabetes mellitus. However, AGD induced by excessive consumption of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has not been previously reported. A 40-year-old male with a history of chronic dyspepsia presented to the emergency department with recurrent vomiting. Over the 3 days prior to admission, he self-reported consuming approximately 3.5 liters of TCM liquid (about 1.1-1.3 liters per day). This attempt to alleviate his chronic dyspepsia symptoms failed to show the expected therapeutic effect. The patient denied experiencing headache, dizziness, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. Abdominal CT revealed significant gastric distension, and subsequent endoscopy showed pyloric ulcer with stenosis, gastric retention, chronic atrophic gastritis, and a relaxed cardia. Laboratory investigations indicated metabolic alkalosis, electrolyte imbalances, and signs of tissue hypoxia. The patient was immediately managed with nasogastric tube decompression, anti-infection therapy, gastric mucosal protection, fluid resuscitation, parenteral nutritional support, fasting, and gastrointestinal decompression. The patient's symptoms and signs notably improved after these interventions. A follow-up CT scan demonstrated improved gastric dilation. At a 4-week follow-up, the patient reported complete resolution of vomiting and resumed normal oral intake. Repeat endoscopy showed healed pyloric ulcers and improved gastric motility. No adverse events (e.g., rehospitalization or medication intolerance) were reported during a 3-month follow-up period. This case highlights the necessity of including AGD in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with frequent vomiting after excessive consumption of TCM. It underscores the importance of thorough evaluation to prevent misdiagnosis and severe complications. The case also emphasizes the need for caution when using TCM, especially in patients with organic lesions or pyloric obstruction."

An 80-year-old woman underwent robot-assisted abdominoperineal resection for anal canal cancer. The postoperative course was uneventful. Two months after the surgery, the patient presented with upper abdominal pain. Computed tomography revealed small bowel obstruction. We diagnosed the patient with strangulating intestinal obstruction and performed emergency laparoscopic surgery. Intraoperative findings revealed small intestinal strangulation and herniation through a defect in the sigmoid mesocolon. The strangulated intestine was released, and the defect was closed using barbed sutures. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 9 without complications. Intraoperative video from the previous surgery showed a small defect in the sigmoid mesocolon suspected to be the origin of the transmesosigmoid hernia. The defect may have formed during the medial approach using an electric scalpel. We emphasized the need for intraoperative vigilance when using energy devices during mesenteric dissection and any mesenteric defect created during surgical procedures should be promptly closed to prevent subsequent transmesenteric internal hernias."

However, increasing reports of long-term complications, such as the presence of an indwelling support tube in the anastomosis, have raised concerns. Despite this, short-term complications, such as gastrointestinal perforation in the absence of tube displacement, remain relatively rare. This report describes a 59-year-old female patient who underwent radical pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (T2N0M0). On the 8th postoperative day, she developed back pain, followed by a sudden increase in body temperature, elevated inflammatory markers, and a significant increase in amylase levels in the drainage fluid. Enhanced abdominal computed tomography revealed that one side of the pancreatic duct support tube had penetrated the abdominal cavity, resulting in posterior peritoneal effusion. Emergency removal of the support tube and repair of the intestinal perforation were performed. The patient had an uneventful recovery after surgery and was discharged on day 20 following the second operation. In cases of postoperative abdominal or low back pain accompanied by signs of infection, complications related to the support tube should be considered. Further studies are needed to evaluate the necessity of placing a pancreatic duct support tube, as well as the timing for its removal after the completion of the anastomosis."

We describe the case of a 10-year-old boy who presented to the emergency department with diffuse abdominal pain of 1 day duration, 2 days after he sustained blunt abdominal trauma with an elbow during a soccer match. He was hemodynamically and clinically stable. Computed tomography scan revealed soft tissue thickening in the left upper quadrant at the root of the mesentery with mild surrounding inflammatory mesenteric fat stranding, suggesting mesenteric shearing. With stable vitals, a soft abdomen on physical exam, and no drop in hemoglobin, the decision was made to treat the patient conservatively. The patient was admitted for observation, and after frequent abdominal exams, stable laboratory results, and abdominal imaging, he was discharged home without any surgical intervention. Conservative management can be successful in the case of a stable patient without alarming physical, laboratory, or imaging findings. Observation and close monitoring remain essential to detect complicated cases that require surgical intervention."

    "abstract": "Prompt diagnosis of strangulated bowel obstruction (SBO) is critical because delayed recognition can lead to life-threatening complications. This study assessed whether the intestinal-to-liver CT attenuation value ratio-a comparison of ischemic bowel-wall enhancement to liver enhancement-can predict the need for intestinal resection in SBO patients. We retrospectively analyzed 52 patients who underwent emergency surgery for suspected SBO from 2014 to 2021. Of these, 35 required intestinal resection due to irreversible ischemia (resection group), while 17 did not (no-resection group). Preoperative clinical and imaging findings were compared between groups. The resection group had a longer time from onset to surgery (p = 0.034) and higher leukocyte counts (p = 0.037). CT values of the poorly enhanced intestinal wall and the intestinal-to-liver attenuation ratio were significantly lower in the resection group (p < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis identified time to surgery (OR 5.08; 95% CI 1.106-23.350; p = 0.037) and CT attenuation ratio (OR 15.50; 95% CI 2.622-91.686; p = 0.0025) as independent predictors of resection. When stratified by the median ratio cutoff (< 0.40 vs. ≥ 0.40), resection rates were 92% and 44%, respectively (p = 0.0001). Additionally, CT attenuation ratio had the diagnostic performance (AUROC 0.886; Youden index 0.736; sensitivity 97.1% and specificity 76.5%.) CONCLUSION: An intestinal-to-liver CT attenuation ratio below 0.40 is a strong predictor of intestinal ischemia requiring resection in SBO patients."

This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic utility of the Jumping-Up (J-Up) test, and to compare it with traditional physical signs. We conducted a prospective observational study from September 2021 to July 2023 in the pediatric emergency department of Asan Medical Center Children's Hospital in Seoul, Korea. Children aged 6-17 years with suspected appendicitis were enrolled. The J-Up test involved instructing patients to jump with both arms raised; the pain response during landing was then assessed. A positive result was defined by visible signs of pain, such as facial grimacing, abdominal guarding, or verbal complaints. Diagnosis was confirmed by contrast-enhanced abdominal CT. The sensitivity of the J-Up test was compared with the sensitivities of rebound tenderness, psoas sign, obturator sign, and Rovsing's sign. Of the 129 children included, 76 were diagnosed with appendicitis. Mean age was 11.7 ± 3 years and 54.3% (n = 70) were male. The J-Up test was more sensitive (80.3%) than rebound tenderness (69.7%). In complicated cases of appendicitis, the J-Up test had a sensitivity of 92.9%, outperforming the other signs. The Jumping-Up test is a simple and effective tool for diagnosing appendicitis in children, especially in identifying complicated cases. It may serve as a practical adjunct to traditional methods of physical examination in pediatric emergency care."

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the effectiveness of cryopreserved human amniotic membrane transplantation (hAMT) in treating infectious keratitis (IK)-related corneal ulcers and perforations and identifies prognostic factors affecting outcomes. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 36 eyes of 36 patients treated with hAMT for IK-induced corneal ulcer or perforation. Demographic and clinical data were reviewed to assess treatment efficacy and outcome predictors. Treatment success was defined as complete re-epithelialization within 3 months post-intervention, while failure included persistent defects, phthisis bulbi, or need for emergency keratoplasty. The mean age was 66.69 ± 14.53 years; 58.3% were male. At presentation, 41.7% had corneal perforation, and 58.3% had corneal thinning without perforation. Corneal cultures were positive in 38.8% of cases (12 bacterial, 4 fungal, 5 polymicrobial). The average time from diagnosis to hAMT was 5 days. The mean epithelial healing time for all eyes was 21.66 ± 12.59 days, with no significant difference between perforated and non-perforated eye groups (p = 0.053). Repeated hAMT was needed in 46.7% of perforated and 19% of non-perforated eyes. Initial success was 66.7%, higher in non-perforated (81%) compared to perforated eyes (53.3%). Final best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) remained stable in 55.6%, decreased in 2.8% and improved in 41.7% of patients, with no significant group difference (p = 0.851). Overall treatment success was 94.4%, with two failures. hAMT is an effective and safe option for managing IK-related corneal ulcers and perforations. It supports epithelial healing and maintains ocular integrity, especially when infection is adequately controlled."

    "title": "A Case Report of Pediatric Abdominal Tuberculosis with Intestinal Perforation Misdiagnosed as Malignancy.",
    "abstract": "Abdominal tuberculosis (TB) in pediatric patients is a rare but serious condition that can often be misdiagnosed as malignancy or other abdominal disorders. Intestinal perforation is a rare and life-threatening complication that presents significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. We report a case of a 13-year-old girl from a TB-endemic region who presented with abdominal distension, weight loss, and vomiting. Initial imaging revealed a multilocular cystic mass in the abdominal cavity, raising suspicion of malignancy. Despite negative results from the tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), diagnostic laparoscopy identified severe intestinal adhesions and multiple perforations. Histopathological examination confirmed abdominal TB, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected in peritoneal fluid using Xpert TB-DNA testing. The patient underwent emergency small bowel ostomy and received intravenous antitubercular therapy along with broad-spectrum antibiotics due to concurrent bacterial infection. After clinical improvement, oral anti-TB therapy was initiated, leading to significant resolution of abdominal pathology. This case highlights the diagnostic complexity of pediatric abdominal TB, particularly when presenting with an abdominal mass complicated by intestinal perforation. Misleading clinical and imaging findings, along with negative immunological tests, may delay diagnosis. Clinicians in TB-endemic regions should maintain a high index of suspicion for TB in cases of unexplained abdominal masses, especially when routine tests fail to provide a clear diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Duodenocaval fistula (DCF) is a rare, life-threatening disease with a mortality rate of approximately 40%. There are several types of etiologies for DCF. Among these, duodenal ulcers are the most dangerous, with a mortality rate of 63.6%. This report describes a case of DCF caused by a duodenal ulcer that was successfully diagnosed and treated, and discusses why duodenal ulcer-induced DCF results in severe outcomes, with a review of the literature. A 64-year-old male patient was transferred to our hospital for surgical treatment of DCF. An emergency laparotomy was performed. We opened the abscess cavity, repaired the perforation site and inferior vena cava, and performed gastrojejunostomy. After the operation, anastomotic leakage was suspected. Although we treated him with antibiotics and antifungal drugs, his condition did not improve, and he experienced elevated total bilirubin and inflammation. Therefore, we decided to perform a reoperation on postoperative day (POD) 30, including cholecystectomy, insertion of a C-tube into the common bile duct for biliary drainage, enterostomy, and peritoneal irrigation and drainage. After that, the patient continued antibiotic and antifungal therapy, with periodic drain flushing and replacement. His condition slowly improved, and he was transferred to another facility for rehabilitation on POD 158. DCF caused by duodenal ulcers has a higher mortality rate than that caused by other etiologies. Therefore, initiating broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal therapy early may be beneficial. Also, it is reasonable to perform simple, rapid, and minimally invasive surgery in an emergency setting. However, even in emergency situations, duodenal decompression, cholecystectomy, and biliary drainage should be performed to prevent anastomotic leakage and biliary complications."

    "abstract": "Aim of this analysis in to assess the prevalence and post-procedural outcomes of surgical bailout during transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Patients undergoing TAVI from September 2017 to March 2023 were enrolled from two high volume centers. All the procedures were performed with on-site cardiac surgery, but especially the scrubbed cardiac surgeon. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality of TAVI patients after emergent cardiac surgery (ECS). Secondary endpoints were intra-operative and 1-year mortality, and post-procedural complications such as acute kidney injury (AKI), stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), conduction abnormalities, need for inotropic support and intensive care unit (ICU) and in- hospital length of stay. A total of 1347 consecutive patients underwent transfemoral TAVI. Ten patients (0.74 %), representing the study population, reported intra-procedural complications requiring ECS: seven patients received a self-expandable prosthesis; three patients received a balloon expandable prosthesis. Indications for ECS included: type A dissection (n = 2), aortic annulus rupture (n = 1), left(n = 1) and right (n = 2) ventricle perforation, mitral valve apparatus damage (n = 2), prosthesis embolization (n = 2). Four patients required post-operative inotropic support. One case of minor stroke and one case of AKI (grade III) were reported. Three patients developed a post procedural left bundle branch block (LBBB). Median ICU and hospital length-of-stay were 4.5 (2-7.75) days and 14 (8-22) days, respectively. One case of in-hospital mortality was reported. The on-site cardiac surgery, with the scrubbed heart surgeon, represents a life-saving resource for TAVI centers in case of ECS, and it is essential to achieve low-rate in-hospital mortality."

    "abstract": "Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) is a rare radiological finding given by the presence of gas within the bowel wall, mainly caused by endoscopic procedures, infections and other gastrointestinal diseases. To date, cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, immunotherapy drugs and monoclonal antibodies used for molecular targeted therapy in oncological patients have been reported as a possible cause of PI, but their role remains unclear. We hereby report the case of a 61-year-old patient with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma in treatment with afatinib-a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), since the diagnosis, who presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain secondary to left-colonic PI. A conservative treatment with drug suspension was successfully attempted. To the best of our knowledge, even though many monoclonal antibodies are associated with this condition, this is the first case report of PI likely induced by afatinib. Although PI is extremely rare, clinicians should be aware of the risk of PI in patients undergoing afatinb therapy and the present case represents a significant warning to differentiate the associated conditions of PI and evaluate whether or not emergency surgery is actually necessary. Therefore, abdominal symptoms in patients receiving oncological treatments should not be overlooked, and clinicians should not hesitate to request targeted radiological investigations to facilitate early diagnosis and management of PI. Timely event detection is imperative to optimal management and to prevent further deterioration, recurrent PI, or even perforation, especially in oncological patients."

    "abstract": "Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (PCI) is a rare condition characterized by the presence of multiple gas-filled cysts located beneath the intestinal submucosa or plasma membrane. The pathogenesis of PCI remains incompletely understood, and its clinical presentation lacks specificity. A 69-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of abdominal distension, abdominal pain lasting over 2 weeks, and altered consciousness for 3 days. She had a two-year history of mixed connective tissue disease and was undergoing regular hormone therapy. Upon admission, she demonstrated signs of peritoneal irritation, and computed tomography (CT) revealed the presence of multiple free air pockets within the abdominal cavity, as well as \"bead-like\" translucent areas within the intestinal wall. An emergency abdominal exploration revealed extensive gas accumulation in the wall of the small intestine and multiple gas bubbles in the mesentery. Subsequently, resection and anastomosis of the affected intestinal section were performed. Postoperative pathology identified multiple non-endothelial cystic cavities within the submucosa and muscularis propria of this segment of the small intestine, with Escherichia coli and Phocaeicola vulgatus detected in the affected intestinal wall. The patient was further treated in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) after surgery, but following a brief period of improvement, she developed a lung infection and unfortunately passed away. This case report demonstrates the diagnostic difficulties in patients with peritonitis with abdominal free gas in intestinal gas cysts, reveals the potential role of abnormal intestinal flora, especially the never reported colonization by Phocaeicola vulgatus, in the development of PCI combined with abdominal free gas."

This condition involves the appendix forming a constricting loop around the ileum, potentially leading to closed-loop obstruction and bowel ischemia. We report the case of a 57-year-old male from Ethiopia who presented with classical features of SBO, including abdominal pain, bilious vomiting, and failure to pass stool and flatus. Imaging was inconclusive, and an exploratory laparotomy revealed appendico-ileal knotting involving the terminal ileum. The bowel was viable, and a simple appendectomy was performed. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on postoperative Day 5. Histopathology confirmed acute appendicitis with mucocele. This case underscores the diagnostic challenge of this rare condition and emphasizes the need for early surgical intervention to avoid complications."

A 54-year-old male with type 1 diabetes and alcohol dependence presented to the emergency department with persistent abdominal and back pain. He had severe metabolic acidosis, hyperglycaemia, and an elevated anion gap, consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis. A computed tomography scan showed thickening and decreased enhancement of the distal small bowel and ascending colon walls, indicating small bowel ischaemia. Treatment involved restoring blood supply to the ischaemic bowel and surgical resection of necrotic tissue. The patient stabilized postsurgery and was weaned from vasopressors and extubated 2 days later. Renal replacement therapy ceased after 8 days, and he eventually returned to normal life. This case emphasizes the importance of investigating persistent severe abdominal pain in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis to identify critical underlying conditions."

Imaging revealed localized free intraperitoneal air and following laparoscopic exploration, a sigmoid perforation secondary to a chicken bone was identified. Laparoscopic primary suture repair was successfully carried out, with the patient making a full and uneventful recovery, being discharged on post-operative Day 9. The case highlights the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic primary suture repair in select cases of sigmoid colon perforation caused by an ingested foreign body.

    "abstract": "An 81-year-old woman residing in a nursing facility due to dementia presented with a 5-day history of vomiting and anorexia. Computed tomography revealed air-containing material in the esophagus, and sponge fragments had been noted in her vomitus 4 days earlier. Accidental sponge ingestion with esophageal impaction was suspected, and emergency endoscopy was performed. The sponge was friable and fragmented easily, making removal difficult. Standard tools including grasping forceps, snares, and nets were ineffective, but a five-pronged grasping forceps enabled successful removal. Follow-up endoscopy revealed an esophageal ulcer presumedly caused by pressure from the sponge, without bleeding or perforation. The ulcer recovered with proton pump inhibitor therapy. Sponge ingestion is a rare cause of esophageal foreign bodies but may become more frequent due to the growing elderly population with cognitive impairment. Sponge is potentially dangerous as it may cause mucosal injury or perforation. However, because they allow fluid passage, symptoms may be mild and diagnosis delayed. Once beyond the duodenum, endoscopic removal becomes extremely difficult. Therefore, sponge foreign bodies should be removed endoscopically when feasible, and simply displacing them to resolve obstruction is not sufficient."

In this case report, successful management of an iatrogenic Staphylococcus aureus peritonitis caused by PPP with nevertheless definitive treatment of a giant loss-of-domain ventral hernia is presented. A female patient with M1-3W3 recurrent incisional hernia with a loss-of-domain of 47% was prepared for definitive ventral hernia repair by chemical component separation with botulinum toxin A-infiltration and PPP via an intraperitoneally placed central venous catheter. A significant increase of inflammatory markers was found after 28 days. An emergency CT scan was performed, which showed the PPP and perihepatic/perisplenic contrast-enhancing fluid collections. Exploratory laparoscopy and laparotomy revealed no bowel perforation but fibrinous peritonitis due to an iatrogenic PPP-catheter-associated peritonitis. Despite the fibrinous peritonitis, we decided to proceed with definitive ventral hernia repair (Rives-Stoppa-Sublay-Herniotomy with transversus abdominis release (left) and anterior component separation (right), 42 × 30 cm permanent polypropylene mesh). Initial calculated antibiotic treatment was performed with piperacillin/tazobactam. Microbiologic examinations revealed Staphylococcus aureus in the intraoperative specimens on postoperative day 1 and the antibiotic treatment was changed to intravenous flucloxacillin for 14 days after surgery. The further hospital stay was uneventful and the patient was discharged on the 20th postoperative day. The presented case demonstrates the possibilities in complex ventral hernia repair to achieve a satisfying outcome for the patients. Even in cases with infectious complications, a single-stage procedure might be performed safely and a complete reconstruction of the abdominal wall might be achieved. The risk of chronic mesh infection in contaminated situations, especially during the presence of Staphylococcus aureus, remains uncertain and has to be weighed against possible benefits."

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to assess acute abdominal pain presentation in pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department. This is a retrospective study in which data was collected from electronic medical records. Presentations, associated symptoms, findings on physical examination, documented diagnostic tests, and outcomes of patients were collected and examined. Two multivariate analysis models were used to investigate factors associated with acute medical abdomen and acute surgical abdomen. Out of 2,169 visits during the study period, 235 (10.8%) patients presented with acute abdominal pain. Forty-five (19%) patients had a surgical abdomen, while the remaining had an acute medical abdomen. The most prevalent diagnosis was \"non-specific abdominal pain\", constituting 61 (26%) patients. Both leukocytosis (OR: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.03-0.51; p = 0.006) and right lower quadrant pain (OR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.08-0.81; p = 0.021) were inversely associated with an acute surgical abdomen and were more suggestive of an acute medical abdomen. In contrast, right lower quadrant pain (OR: 13.9; 95% CI: 5.03-43.5; p < 0.001), leukocytosis (OR: 3.26; 95% CI: 1.07-11.1; p = 0.045), and neutrophilia (OR: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.01-1.09; p = 0.031) were found to be significantly associated with acute appendicitis. Pediatric patients' presentations to the emergency department exhibit a diversity of presentations, and diagnostics may be less evident compared to adult patients. Right lower quadrant pain and leukocytosis may be more indicative of a non-surgical abdomen rather than a surgical abdomen among different diagnoses that require surgical intervention. However, right lower quadrant pain and leukocytosis are still strongly associated with acute appendicitis out of different surgical diagnoses. To combine both findings, our conclusion is that right lower quadrant pain and leukocytosis are more predictive of an acute medical abdomen, but only when appendicitis is less likely to be one of the differential diagnoses. These findings challenge conventional clinical paradigms, suggesting that right lower quadrant pain could be a stronger predictor of medical conditions, which typically do not require surgical intervention."

    "abstract": "Two patient cases are presented in this case series. Both patients presented with vague abdominal pain, and CT imaging showed calcified mesenteric masses. Definitive diagnoses of sclerosing mesenteritis was made on histological evaluation. Interestingly, one of these patients was initially misdiagnosed with a neuroendocrine tumor after Octreotide scan showed increased mesenteric uptake. He underwent treatment for neuroendocrine tumor however had disease progression to small bowel obstruction, requiring emergent exploratory laparotomy with palliative resection of the mesenteric mass and involved small bowel. He experienced cardiac arrest in the immediate post-operative period and unfortunately did not survive. This case series exemplifies the importance of early diagnosis and management to prevent catastrophic complications in an otherwise benign disease."

    "title": "External Validation of an Upgraded AI Model for Screening Ileocolic Intussusception Using Pediatric Abdominal Radiographs: Multicenter Retrospective Study.",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in radiology, but its development in pediatric imaging remains limited, particularly for emergent conditions. Ileocolic intussusception is an important cause of acute abdominal pain in infants and toddlers and requires timely diagnosis to prevent complications such as bowel ischemia or perforation. While ultrasonography is the diagnostic standard due to its high sensitivity and specificity, its accessibility may be limited, especially outside tertiary centers. Abdominal radiographs (AXRs), despite their limited sensitivity, are often the first-line imaging modality in clinical practice. In this context, AI could support early screening and triage by analyzing AXRs and identifying patients who require further ultrasonography evaluation. This study aimed to upgrade and externally validate an AI model for screening ileocolic intussusception using pediatric AXRs with multicenter data and to assess the diagnostic performance of the model in comparison with radiologists of varying experience levels with and without AI assistance. This retrospective study included pediatric patients (≤5 years) who underwent both AXRs and ultrasonography for suspected intussusception. Based on the preliminary study from hospital A, the AI model was retrained using data from hospital B and validated with external datasets from hospitals C and D. Diagnostic performance of the upgraded AI model was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). A reader study was conducted with 3 radiologists, including 2 trainees and 1 pediatric radiologist, to evaluate diagnostic performance with and without AI assistance. Based on the previously developed AI model trained on 746 patients from hospital A, an additional 431 patients from hospital B (including 143 intussusception cases) were used for further training to develop an upgraded AI model. External validation was conducted using data from hospital C (n=68; 19 intussusception cases) and hospital D (n=90; 30 intussusception cases). The upgraded AI model achieved a sensitivity of 81.7% (95% CI 68.6%-90%) and a specificity of 81.7% (95% CI 73.3%-87.8%), with an AUC of 86.2% (95% CI 79.2%-92.1%) in the external validation set. Without AI assistance, radiologists showed lower performance (overall AUC 64%; sensitivity 49.7%; specificity 77.1%). With AI assistance, radiologists' specificity improved to 93% (difference +15.9%; P<.001), and AUC increased to 79.2% (difference +15.2%; P=.05). The least experienced reader showed the largest improvement in specificity (+37.6%; P<.001) and AUC (+14.7%; P=.08). The upgraded AI model improved diagnostic performance for screening ileocolic intussusception on pediatric AXRs. It effectively enhanced the specificity and overall accuracy of radiologists, particularly those with less experience in pediatric radiology. A user-friendly software platform was introduced to support broader clinical validation and underscores the potential of AI as a screening and triage tool in pediatric emergency settings."

    "title": "Endoscopic closure of 5-cm long esophageal perforation in an elderly patient with achalasia.",
    "abstract": "Chronic esophageal achalasia can lead to significant morphological changes in the esophagus, posing challenges during endoscopic examinations. Here, we report a case of iatrogenic esophageal perforation in an elderly patient with achalasia. An 80-year-old woman presented with severe dysphagia and marked weight loss, indicating chronic malnutrition. She had a 50-year history of achalasia, previously treated with a Heller-Dor operation. Endoscopic evaluation was performed to assess the esophageal condition; however, during the procedure, an iatrogenic perforation occurred. The patient underwent urgent management under general anesthesia. Two drainage tubes were placed at the base of the right thoracic cavity. Saline infusion via the perforation site enabled endoscopic lavage of the thoracic cavity. The perforation was initially closed with the thread-and-clip technique. After 30 days, the perforation site had developed into a fistula approximately 1 cm in size. Attempts to close it using argon plasma coagulation ablation and over-the-scope clip were unsuccessful. It was presumed that the significant accumulation of fluid in the esophagus due to achalasia was hindering fistula closure. Consequently, peroral endoscopic myotomy was performed, ultimately leading to the closure of the fistula. Despite requiring prolonged hospitalization for recovery and nutritional rehabilitation, the patient was eventually discharged in stable condition, able to consume meals without difficulty. This case underscores the high risk of esophageal perforation during endoscopy in elderly patients with advanced achalasia and subsequent malnutrition. Furthermore, it highlights the potential for successful management of severe complications like esophageal perforation through advanced endoscopic techniques, thereby avoiding the need for surgical intervention."

    "abstract": "Enhanced recovery pathways (ERPs) are evidence-based, multimodal strategies designed to promote early recovery and to optimize surgical outcomes. While extensively implemented in elective surgery, their adaptation to emergency general surgery (EGS) raises challenges due to patient instability and limited preoperative time. The study aimed to evaluate the adherence to each ERPs item and the impact on short-term outcomes in patients undergoing emergency general surgery. This is a multicenter observational prospective study carried out in 13 Italian centers. Inclusion criteria targeted adults undergoing surgery for intestinal occlusion or perforation. Patients re-operated after elective surgery were excluded. The primary endpoints were the adherence to intraoperative ERP items and the compliance to the postoperative recovery pathway. Secondary endpoints were postoperative mortality, morbidity, and length of hospital stay. Between March 2023 and March 2024, 760 patients were analyzed. The highest adherence was observed for active warming (97%), PONV prevention (92%), and long-acting opioid avoidance (87%). The lowest adherence was found for invasive arterial pressure monitoring (35%), depth of anesthesia monitoring (34%), locoregional analgesia (31%), and minimally invasive surgery (26%). By postoperative day 3, 66% of patients tolerated solid diets and 58% had discontinued intravenous fluids. Postoperative mortality, morbidity, and major complications occurred in 3%, 33%, and 9% of patients, respectively. Median hospital stay was 7 days. This study underscores the adherence to ERP in EGS, highlighting the potential of ERP to improve perioperative outcomes in a high-risk population. Future research should prioritize strategies to enhance adherence, particularly to underutilized components as goal-directed fluid therapy and minimally invasive surgery and further optimize ERP protocols for emergency settings."

    "abstract": "The stepwise initiation of peritoneal dialysis (PD) using Moncrief and Popovich's technique (SMAP) is widely used for systemic PD introduction and catheter-related infection prevention. This study aimed to investigate patients who would benefit from SMAP in terms of mortality and PD-related peritonitis development. In total, 328 consecutive patients underwent PD catheter implantation at our institute. Inverse probability of treatment weights was calculated, and patients who benefited from SMAP were explored retrospectively. Overall, 285 patients were analyzed (direct group, n = 96; SMAP group, n = 189). Patients in the SMAP group tended to have a lower mortality risk than those in the direct group, whereas this tendency decreased in the IPW-adjusted population. Peritonitis was observed in 40 and 85 patients in the direct and SMAP groups, and PD catheters were removed in 59 and 118 patients in the direct and SMAP groups. The two main causes were peritonitis and insufficient dialysis. The risk of mortality decreased with SMAP among patients with a nutrition risk index score for Japanese hemodialysis patients ≥ 8, prognostic nutritional index score ≤ 40, serum creatinine level < 8 mg/dl, and body mass index < 23 kg/m2. Additionally, the risk of peritonitis decreased in patients with emergent hemodialysis induction before PD and with previous abdominal surgery. PD catheter implantation using SMAP may not be mandatory in clinical practice. However, this technique can be a good option, depending on the patient, in terms of mortality and peritonitis. Personalized treatment strategies should be considered to improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: The optimal surgical management of perforated gastric cancer (PGC) in emergency settings remains controversial. Urgent upfront one-stage gastrectomy (1SG) and two-stage gastrectomy (2SG) with damage-control surgery followed by elective gastrectomy have been proposed. The aim of the present systematic review is to compare short- and long-term outcomes between 1SG and 2SG in the treatment of PGC. Methods: A systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of studies reporting data of patients undergoing 1SG vs. 2SG for PGC was conducted. The time-dependent effects of surgical interventions were assessed using a likelihood ratio test. Hazard function plots were generated via marginal prediction. Results: Ten retrospective series (579 patients) were included. Overall, 482 patients (83%) underwent 1SG, while 97 patients (17%) were treated with 2SG. A trend toward better short-term oncological outcomes and safety profiles for 2SG compared to 1SG was observed. Long-term outcomes were comparable between 1SG and 2SG, and the IPD meta-analysis showed no statistically significant difference between the two approaches in terms of OS or hazard for mortality at all time points. A trend towards a higher hazard for mortality was observed for 1SG in the first 20 months postoperatively. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that 1SG and 2SG yield comparable short-term outcomes, although 2SG may be associated with a lower medium-term mortality risk. Further research is needed to identify key factors to improve clinical judgments and decision-making in PGC."

    "abstract": "Ileosigmoid knotting(ISK), a rare but life-threatening condition which first described in 1845. It occurred when the ileum twisting around the sigmoid colon and causing intestinal obstruction and potential perforation. A 60-year-old male from the Garbo region of Somali, Ethiopia, presented to the hospital after a a four-day history of intestinal obstruction symptoms. On examination, he was tachycardic and febrile, and exhibited diffuse abdominal tenderness. A diagnosis of intestinal obstruction with generalized peritonitis was made after abdominal x ray. The patient was resuscitated with fluids, started on antibiotics, and a nasogastric tube was placed. Emergency laparotomy revealed ileosigmoid knotting with gangrenous bowel. En bloc resection of the affected ileum and sigmoid colon was performed. An ileo-jejunal anastomosis and an end colostomy were constructed. Despite these interventions, the patient succumbed to uncontrolled sepsis on the fourth postoperative day. Ileosigmoid knotting (ISK), a rare and deadly form of intestinal obstruction, is more common in the \"volvulus belt\" regions like Africa and parts of Asia. It involves a twisted knot of the ileum and sigmoid colon and can be caused by factors like a narrow mesentery or hypermobile ileum. ISK is difficult to diagnose with standard tests and often requires surgical exploration. The mortality is high (up to 48 %), especially in resource-limited settings due to various challenges. Ileosigmoid knotting is a rare and dangerous cause of intestinal obstruction requiring quick action. Poor outcomes are common, especially in resource-limited areas like Ethiopia due to late presentation and limited healthcare resources."

    "abstract": "Emergent diagnosis of colorectal cancer is associated with increased postoperative complications and poorer prognosis. We assessed the rate of emergent presentation of colorectal cancer at our institution, identified risk factors for emergent presentation, and compared our results to national data. Retrospective review was conducted of all patients treated for colon and rectal cancer at a single institution between 2012 and 2021. Pearson correlation identified trends over time in four major outcomes: setting of diagnosis, urgent/emergent surgery, obstruction, and/or perforation. Binomial logistic regression determined associations between outcomes and preoperative/demographic factors. NSQIP data of colectomy for colon cancer from 2012 to 2021 was analyzed for equivalent outcomes. Seven hundred thirty-three patients with colon cancer and 429 with rectal cancer were included. Of patients with colon cancer, 48.2% were diagnosed in the inpatient setting, 31.8% underwent urgent/emergent surgery, 26.0% were obstructed, and 8.9% were perforated. Of patients with rectal cancer, 28.3% were diagnosed in the inpatient setting, 12.2% underwent urgent/emergent surgery, 18.0% were obstructed, and 6.0% were perforated. All outcomes increased over time. NSQIP reports 6.4% of colectomies for colon cancer were emergent, 4.0% of patients were obstructed, and 1.5% of patients were perforated, with no significant change over time. Medicaid insurance increased likelihood of emergent diagnosis and up to date colonoscopy was protective. The rate of emergent presentation and treatment of colon and rectal cancer at our institution is high compared to national data and is increasing over time. Risk factors identified suggest access to care is a barrier to timely diagnosis and treatment."

    "abstract": "Genital trauma following child sexual abuse presents a complex and variable clinical picture of pelvic perineal injury, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of the structures involved in effective management. Ideally, these cases are considered urgent, and primary repair should be performed as an emergency. Unfortunately, the window of opportunity for urgent action may be missed as the patient may not present for care until much later. We report the case of a 3-year-old African (Congolese) girl who presented to the Panzi Hospital's sexual violence ward in Bukavu, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), 3 days after being sexually abused by an adult family friend. Clinical examination revealed a complex perineal tear with a split in the posterior vaginal wall extending to the posterior vaginal cul-de-sac and a fourth-degree rectal prolapse. A cleft was also noted in the external orifice of the urethral meatus. All the lesions were infected and covered with fibrin, with no signs of peritonitis. Initial management included admission for locoregional treatment with antiseptic solution and sitz baths. A total of 2 weeks later, surgical intervention was performed, which resulted in improved short- and long-term outcomes in terms of the vulvar cosmetic, functional, and psychological aspects. In cases of delayed access to medical care for several days for complex genital trauma following child sexual abuse, treatment of the infection and delayed closure lead to better outcomes."

    "abstract": "While COVID-19 primarily manifests as a respiratory illness, gastrointestinal complications-including severe colitis and perforation-have been reported, particularly in adults. However, such presentations in infants remain exceedingly rare. A 6-month-old infant presented with lethargy and poor feeding, initially diagnosed with sepsis. Subsequent testing confirmed COVID-19 positivity. During hospitalization, the patient developed feeding intolerance, vomiting, and abdominal distension. Imaging revealed free intraperitoneal fluid with suspected perforation. Emergency laparotomy revealed perforations in the transverse and descending colon, necessitating total colectomy. This case provides laboratory and histopathological evidence linking SARS-CoV-2 to intestinal perforation in infants, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to ischemic or inflammatory bowel injury leading to perforation. Early surgical intervention is critical in such scenarios. Further research is needed to establish causality and pathophysiology."

    "abstract": "Focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) is a valuable tool in managing adult trauma patients but has poor utility in children due to its poor sensitivity. Multiple studies have explored the addition of liver enzymes to improve the diagnostic accuracy of FAST in pediatric blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) patients. A retrospective study at our institute used FAST findings with liver enzymes (F-AST score) to rule out Intra-Abdominal Injury (IAI) in pediatric BAT patients, concluding that normal liver enzymes and a negative FAST scan can effectively rule out IAI. This study aimed to validate the F-AST score (FAST + Aspartate Transaminase) as a screening tool for identifying IAI in pediatric BAT and compared it with the FAST examination. A prospective diagnostic accuracy study was conducted at a single center from August 2020 to April 2022. It included patients under 14 years old with blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) within 8 h of injury who had a positive FAST scan, a dangerous injury mechanism, or clinical signs of intra-abdominal injury (IAI) or peritonitis. Patients in cardiac arrest, needing damage control surgery, or with chronic liver or kidney diseases were excluded. Participants underwent liver enzyme tests (AST) and FAST examinations, followed by a computed tomography (CT) scan. The diagnostic accuracy of the F-AST score was then compared to the CT findings, which served as the gold standard. A total of 125 patients were recruited for the study. FAST was positive in 12.8 % (n = 16) of the patients. FAST alone had a sensitivity of 52.9 % in detecting BAT. Whereas, the F-AST score was found to be 94 % sensitive and 63 % specific in identifying IAI in contrast enhanced CT (CECT) abdomen. The negative predictive value (NPV) increased to 98.6 % and the negative likelihood ratio (NLR) decreased to 0.093 using the F-AST score. The receivers operating characteristics curve (ROC) curve analysis for the F-AST score was found to be excellently accurate (95 % CI:0.754-0.943, p < 0.001). The most common injured organ was found to be the liver (n = 11). The F-AST score, incorporating both FAST findings and AST levels, improves sensitivity and negative predictive value over FAST alone in identifying intra-abdominal injuries. Patients with a F-AST score of zero may be safely observed in the emergency department, potentially avoiding unnecessary CT scans. However, further prospective trials are warranted for validation."

    "abstract": "Background: Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency, predominantly affecting young males. Although laparoscopic appendectomy reduces adverse outcomes, potential complications related to this condition are known. Among these, hepatic abscess is a rare and severe complication, with limited cases reported in the literature. Case Report: We report a case of an 18-years-old male with diffuse purulent peritonitis due to perforated appendicitis who developed a hepatic abscess one month post-surgery. Despite the initial management including surgical intervention and antibiotic therapy, after one month the patient presented with high temperature and right upper quadrant pain, leading to the discovery and subsequent percutaneous drainage of a hepatic abscess and intravenous antibiotic therapy. The abscess culture identified Bacteroides Fragilis, guiding targeted antibiotic therapy and resulting in a full recovery. Discussion: This case highlights the potential for hepatic abscess formation following acute appendicitis, suspected to arise from hematogenous bacterial spread. Given the uncommon nature of this complication, a high index of suspicion in patients presenting with unusual symptoms post-appendectomy is required. Immediate percutaneous drainage alongside broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, followed by targeted treatment upon pathogen identification, is crucial for managing this life-threatening condition. Conclusion: Although rare, hepatic abscess can occur as a complication of acute appendicitis, underscoring the importance of awareness and prompt intervention to prevent severe outcomes. Percutaneous drainage of the abscess associated to a targeted antibiotic therapy represents the treatment of choice."

The minimally invasive approach was complicated, necessitating an open laparotomy, which ultimately prolonged the hospital stay. A female in her early 60s with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (on methotrexate) and hypothyroidism presented to the emergency department with jaundice as her chief complaint. Upon arrival, the patient was vitally stable. The only pertinent finding was scleral icterus. Laboratory results revealed AST of 263 U/L, ALT of 233 U/L, ALP of 1246 U/L, GGT of 342 U/L, total bilirubin of 5.8 mg/dL, and direct bilirubin of 4.6 mg/dL. Abdominal ultrasound showed dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts, with a common bile duct measuring 16 mm, raising concern for biliary obstruction. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed marked intrahepatic ductal dilation resulting from extrinsic compression of the common hepatic duct (CHD) by impacted gallstones at the gallbladder neck, findings that are consistent with Mirizzi syndrome. Hence, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was deferred and she underwent subsequent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which turned into open surgery, and ended up getting bile duct resection with hepaticojejunostomy. Her postoperative course got complicated with partial small bowel obstruction, which was managed conservatively. Mirizzi syndrome presents a formidable diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Our experience with this particular case reinforces that laparotomy offers a safer and more effective approach for managing Mirizzi syndrome in similar circumstances."

    "abstract": "The enhanced totally extraperitoneal (eTEP) Rives-Stoppa repair is increasingly adopted for incisional hernia repair due to its minimally invasive approachand favorable outcomes. However, rare but severe complications, such as small bowel perforation into the retro-rectus space, may occur, necessitating prompt recognitionand management. An 80-year-old male underwent eTEP Rives-Stoppa repair for an EHS L2 incisional hernia, involving retro-rectus dissection, transversus abdominis release, and mesh placement. On postoperative day 1, he developed hypotension and extensive subcutaneous ecchymosis, without abdominal pain or fever. Initial computed tomography (CT) revealed a retro-rectus fluid collection suggestive of hemorrhage. By day 2, repeat CT showed increased free air and enteric content, indicating bowel perforation. Emergency laparotomy confirmed a dehiscent posterior rectus sheath with a perforated small bowel segment protruding into the retro-rectus space. The mesh was removed, the affected bowel resected, and temporary abdominal closure was performed due to severe inflammation and edema. The postoperative course was complicated by recurrent bacteremia and abscesses, requiring prolonged antimicrobial therapy and intensive care. The patient recovered and was transferred to a rehabilitation facility six months later. This is the first reported case of small bowel perforation into the retro-rectus space following eTEP Rives-Stoppa repair. Contributing factors included advanced age, high tension in the posterior sheath, pre-existing bowel adhesions, and increased intra-abdominal pressure from postoperative coughing. Surgeons should maintain a high index of suspicion for this life-threatening complication, particularly in elderly or frail patients, and consider early imaging for atypical postoperative symptoms to enable timely intervention."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is one of the most common causes of emergency abdominal surgery, and early identification of complicated cases is critical for effective clinical management. Although classical inflammatory markers such as white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and immature granulocyte percentage (IG%) are commonly used in diagnosis, their predictive accuracy remains limited. The HALP score (hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte, and platelet score), which incorporates hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte, and platelet levels, may offer a more comprehensive assessment by reflecting both inflammatory and immuno-nutritional status. This retrospective study included 854 patients who underwent appendectomy between January 2022 and December 2023 at a tertiary care center. Based on surgical and pathological findings, patients were categorized into two groups: complicated and uncomplicated appendicitis. Demographic data, along with hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte, platelet, WBC, CRP, and IG% values, were recorded. The diagnostic performance of these parameters was statistically evaluated. Among the 854 patients, 112 (13.1%) were diagnosed with complicated appendicitis. Complicated cases showed a signifi-cantly higher median age and a predominance of female patients. CRP, WBC, IG%, and platelet levels were significantly elevated in the complicated group, while hemoglobin, albumin, and lymphocyte counts were lower. The HALP score was significantly lower in patients with complicated appendicitis compared to those with uncomplicated appendicitis (median: 32.8 vs. 53.4, p<0.001). Among the evalu-ated markers, the HALP score demonstrated the highest diagnostic performance (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.732), followed by CRP (AUC: 0.706), IG% (AUC: 0.645), and WBC (AUC: 0.574). The HALP score is a valuable and easily applicable biomarker for predicting complicated acute appendicitis. It outperforms traditional inflammatory markers by incorporating parameters that reflect both systemic inflammation and immuno-nutritional status. Routine use of the HALP score in emergency surgical evaluations may facilitate early identification of high-risk patients and guide clinical decision-making. Prospective, multicenter studies are needed to further validate its clinical utility."

Aggregate results of three n-of-1 clinical trials. Three patients from a tertiary pediatric health care center with a recent diagnosis of LC due to plasminogen deficiency. Three patients with LC and low serum plasminogen activity were enrolled in n = 1 clinical trials. Patients received hourly TPC eye drops in the affected eye, tapered per treatment response to once daily. The first patient presented with Streptococcus pyogenes corneal ulcer and pseudomembranes (PMs) in his right eye following an upper respiratory tract infection. Despite aggressive topical antibiotics and subsequent addition of topical corticosteroids, corneal perforation occurred. Urgent penetrating keratoplasty, peeling of the PMs, and amniotic membrane transplantation were performed to both upper and lower palpebral conjunctivas. PMs recurred rapidly, prompting further investigation and the diagnosis of LC. The patient was started on hourly TPC and improved promptly, with complete resolution of PMs after 4 weeks. The second and third patients were started on the TPC protocol shortly after presentation. They showed resolution of PMs after 3 weeks and 1 week, respectively. Two patients were stable under maintenance TPC once daily at last follow-up with no recurrences. One patient had PM recurrence with upper respiratory tract infections, requiring intermittent increases of TPC to hourly dosage. Despite regulatory barriers, TPC yielded highly favorable outcomes in these challenging cases of LC."

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive motor neuron disease primarily affecting the neuromuscular system. Gastrointestinal manifestations are typically functional in nature, while mechanical obstructions are rarely reported. Meckel's diverticulum (MD), a congenital gastrointestinal anomaly, is often asymptomatic but can cause obstruction in rare adult cases. We present the case of a 30-year-old male with early-onset ALS who presented with signs of intestinal obstruction, including severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and obstipation. Imaging revealed a closed-loop small bowel obstruction. Emergency laparotomy identified a torsed Meckel's diverticulum as the underlying cause. Surgical resection was performed, and the postoperative course was managed with tracheostomy and PEG placement due to progressive ALS-related respiratory and swallowing impairment. The patient was successfully stabilized and discharged with ongoing multidisciplinary support. The patient was discharged three weeks later in a stable condition and remains alive under multidisciplinary follow-up. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge of distinguishing mechanical from functional gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with advanced ALS. While neurodegenerative progression often explains GI complaints in ALS, this case emphasizes the need to consider alternative etiologies, including surgical emergencies like MD-related obstruction. Mechanical small bowel obstruction due to Meckel's diverticulum in ALS is exceedingly rare. Timely diagnosis and intervention, supported by multidisciplinary perioperative care, are critical for favorable outcomes in this high-risk population. Despite significant ALS-related comorbidities, the patient's outcome was favorable with stable discharge and ongoing respiratory and nutritional support."

    "title": "Tricky acute mesenteric ischemia: what can we do?",
    "abstract": "Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a life-threatening vascular disorder that demands greater clinical and research attention due to its significant morbidity and mortality risks. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for AMI in patients presenting with severe abdominal pain disproportionate to physical findings, particularly those with atrial fibrillation or recent vasoconstrictor use. In such cases, prompt computed tomography angiography is recommended as the initial diagnostic modality, given its high sensitivity, specificity, efficiency, and favorable safety profile. Multi-disciplinary treatment plays a critical role in elucidating disease etiology and guiding therapeutic decision-making. For confirmed cases of intestinal necrosis, open surgical intervention remains the gold standard. Laparoscopic exploration offers a minimally invasive alternative for assessing bowel viability while reducing unnecessary surgical trauma in equivocal presentations. In the pre-necrotic phase of intestinal ischemia, emerging endovascular therapies demonstrate increasing promise due to their minimally invasive nature and improved clinical outcomes, warranting further investigation. Continuous clinical vigilance is essential throughout management. Persistent abdominal pain or signs of peritonitis may indicate disease progression, necessitating urgent reassessment for possible ischemic necrosis and therapeutic strategy adjustments. This review synthesizes current evidence by examining AMI pathophysiology, anatomical considerations, risk factors, and diagnostic-therapeutic advancements, with an emphasis on optimizing clinical decision-making in this critical condition."

    "abstract": "The standard treatment for hydrocephalus is often the placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS), especially in patients with myelomeningocele (MMC). This case report aimed to enrich the existing knowledge by presenting a rare instance of asymptomatic anal extrusion of a VPS catheter in an infant, along with a review of the relevant literature. A 2-month-old male infant with myelomeningocele (MMC) and hydrocephalus presented with asymptomatic anal extrusion of his ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) catheter, discovered by his mother. Emergency imaging revealed distal catheter migration through the rectosigmoid junction. Surgical management included (1) laparoscopic-assisted catheter removal with bowel repair using Vicryl sutures, (2) intraoperative external ventricular drain (EVD) placement, and (3) 14-day antibiotic prophylaxis. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis remained normal throughout the treatment. Following three weeks of infection monitoring, contralateral VPS replacement was performed successfully, with postoperative imaging confirming optimal shunt function and resolved hydrocephalus. This case highlighted the importance of caregiver vigilance in identifying this rare but serious complication, even in asymptomatic patients (Fig. 1). Although anal extrusion of a VPS catheter is an uncommon but serious complication, primarily seen in pediatric patients, it can lead to lifethreatening infections if untreated. Prompt surgical intervention along with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is critical. This report highlights the need for recognizing classic symptoms of intestinal perforation and catheter migration in pediatric patients."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems' ability to perform tasks requiring human intelligence. In recent years, AI has rapidly evolved in various fields, including the medical field. The integration of AI into emergency surgical care represents a significant advancement in modern medicine. This field has developed rapidly, particularly since the mid-2010s. The advancement in AI-assisted emergency surgery is built upon several technological pillars, such as deep learning, natural language processing for rapid medical record analysis, and integration with existing hospital information systems. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning in identifying emergency patients and the effectiveness of AI methods in diagnosing them compared to conventional methods. We also aim to assess AI's capability in predicting complications and the need for surgical intervention. The systematic review included English-language research papers published between 2015 and 2025 focusing on human studies. Two independent reviewers analyzed articles following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, screening titles from five significant databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane, and Embase). The final selection process ensured all included studies aligned with the primary research question examining machine learning's impact on emergency care accuracy and efficiency. This systematic review identified 19 eligible studies from an initial pool of 2791 publications. The results showed the significance of the application of AI across five key areas of emergency surgery: appendicitis management (five studies), emergency abdominal surgery risk assessment (five studies), acute abdominal pain and triage (two studies), bowel obstruction (four studies), and acute conditions of the gallbladder and mesenteric vessels (three studies). Machine learning models demonstrated promising accuracy rates compared to conventional methods in all the different aspects. This systematic review highlights the promising impact of AI and machine learning across emergency surgery domains. The models demonstrated remarkable accuracy (72-98%) across various applications, from appendicitis diagnosis to cholecystitis detection. Most notably, AI tools showed superior performance in acute abdominal pain triage and risk assessment compared to conventional methods, suggesting their potential to enhance clinical decision-making in emergency surgical settings."

    "abstract": "Esophageal perforations caused by a foreign body are a serious condition requiring urgent intervention due to the risk of severe mediastinitis. However, certain calcified anatomical structures may be misdiagnosed as a foreign body owing to the similarities of the features on imaging studies. We herein report the case of a seven-year-old female patient who presented with persistent pharyngeal discomfort after ingesting skewered beef containing bone fragments. Initial computed tomography (CT) at the previous hospital revealed a high-density mediastinal shadow, which raised suspicion of an esophageal perforation. Further evaluation at the study center identified a right aortic arch with a Kommerell diverticulum and a linear, high-density lesion between the diverticulum and the pulmonary artery in the area corresponding to the ductus arteriosus. In the absence of inflammatory signs, the lesion was diagnosed as ligamentum arteriosum calcification associated with a vascular ring. The patient was managed conservatively and discharged without complications. This case highlights the importance of recognizing that ligamentum arteriosum calcification can mimic esophageal perforation. Assessing whether the symptoms correlate with mediastinitis due to an esophageal perforation, along with the accurate interpretation of CT findings, including the anatomical location of the lesion and the absence of inflammatory signs, was crucial to avoid unnecessary invasive procedures."

We report a case of a 64-year-old female who presented with acute intestinal obstruction secondary to an internal hernia associated with volvulus. She had a previous surgical history of exploratory laparotomy 25 years back. This case illustrates the diagnostic challenges of internal hernias and emphasizes the importance of considering this entity in patients with previous abdominal surgery presenting with bowel obstruction.

    "abstract": "Postoperative ileus (POI) is a relatively common complication of abdominal surgery that typically resolves with conservative treatment. However, in rare cases, it may progress to a more severe condition. We present the case of a 25-year-old man who developed severe POI and pneumoperitoneum without gastrointestinal perforation after receiving continuous epidural morphine following gastrectomy. Postoperative analgesia was maintained with the continuous epidural administration of morphine and ropivacaine. On postoperative day 2, the patient experienced worsening abdominal pain. Imaging studies revealed the presence of free intra-abdominal gas, a dilated intestinal tract, and portal venous gas. Emergency surgery was performed due to suspected intestinal necrosis; however, no perforation or obstruction was identified. The findings were attributed to increased intraluminal pressure and mucosal injury resulting from paralytic ileus. An ileal tube was inserted for decompression. Following the second surgery, persistent abdominal distention prompted the discontinuation of epidural morphine. Subsequent improvement in bowl dilation was observed; the patient has remained in stable condition since. In this case, opioid-induced suppression of gastrointestinal motility likely contributed to the development of severe paralytic ileus and pneumoperitoneum. Although epidural morphine is generally considered safe, its potential impact on gastrointestinal function warrants caution. Regular monitoring of gastrointestinal motility and early intervention are essential during opioid use. This case report underscores the importance of risk assessment in postoperative pain management."

Although benign, DTs exhibit local invasion and recurrence and may present sporadically or with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Gardner's syndrome. The clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic abdominal masses to severe complications such as bowel obstruction and perforation. This case report highlights a 46-year-old male with acute diffuse peritonitis due to perforation of a mesenteric fibromatosis (MF). Imaging revealed a large mesenteric mass causing bowel perforation, necessitating an urgent exploratory laparotomy. Surgical intervention entailed resection of the affected small bowel and mesentery with temporary stoma formation. Histopathology confirmed MF with negative margins, and the patient was discharged in stable condition. This case highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in managing such complex cases, the challenges in diagnosing and treating intra-abdominal DTs, and the role of surgical resection with careful postoperative monitoring despite recurrence concerns."

Although any esophageal segment may be affected, the thoracic esophagus is most frequently involved, with perforations typically resulting from iatrogenic causes, trauma, or spontaneous rupture. Food bolus-induced perforations are exceptionally uncommon, with perforation by impacted hot potato being extraordinarily rare-only 1 prior case has been reported in medical literature. Computed tomography (CT) plays an indispensable diagnostic role, with characteristic findings including focal esophageal wall discontinuity, extraluminal mediastinal gas, and adjacent fat stranding. We describe a 16-year-old male prisoner who presented with chest pain and dysphagia 48 hours after inadvertently swallowing a hot potato; CT confirmed thoracic esophageal perforation secondary to the impacted bolus. The patient was managed nonoperatively with excellent clinical outcome. To our knowledge, this represents only the second reported case of esophageal perforation caused by an impacted hot potato."

It mostcommonly affects the distal ileum and is more prevalent in elderly patients. We present the case of a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension who was admitted with vomiting and abdominal distension for 72 hours. CT imaging revealed pneumobilia, intestinal obstruction, and an ectopic gallstone, consistent with Rigler's triad. The gallstone, measuring 3 × 2 cm, was located 130 cm distal to the Treitz ligament. The patient underwent an emergency exploratory laparotomy with enterolithotomy, successfully removing the gallstone. Postoperatively, the patient recovered uneventfully, with complete resolution of symptoms. Gallstone ileus should be considered in elderly patients with intestinal obstruction, and early diagnosis using CT imaging is crucial for guiding treatment.

    "abstract": "To investigate the effect of graded emergency nursing intervention on the incidence of in-hospital complications in patients with acute abdomen and to evaluate patient satisfaction with nursing care. Between June 2021 and June 2023, 100 patients with acute abdomen (85 with acute appendicitis) were randomly assigned to a control group (routine nursing care, n = 50) or an emergency care (EC) group (graded emergency intervention, n = 50). Graded emergency nursing intervention was implemented based on the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) version 4, which stratifies patients from Level I (life-threatening) to Level V (non-urgent). The EC group received structured emergency triage by trained nursing teams, including systematic protocols for patient observation, inquiry, physical examination, and condition analysis. Outcomes included emergency care efficiency indicators (consultation time, examination time, emergency department stay, trauma control time, hospital stay), complication rates (e.g., abdominal infection, hemorrhage, puncture site infection, subcutaneous emphysema), clinical symptom recovery (abdominal pain duration, gastrointestinal recovery time), and nursing satisfaction scores. Data were analyzed using t-tests and chi-square tests via SPSS 21.0, with significance set at p < 0.05. The EC group showed significantly lower rates of in-hospital complications (2% vs. 14%, p < 0.05), faster clinical response times (shorter consultation and examination times, reduced emergency department and hospital stay durations), and quicker symptom recovery compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Nursing satisfaction scores were also significantly higher in the EC group (p < 0.05). Graded emergency nursing intervention-based on triage acuity, structured symptom assessment, and trained response teams-effectively reduces the incidence of complications, enhances emergency response efficiency, shortens recovery and hospital stay durations, and improves patient satisfaction. This approach is clinically valuable and recommended for broader implementation."

    "abstract": "Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital disorder marked by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal bowel, resulting in severe constipation and bowel obstruction. Surgery is currently the primary treatment for HSCR. However, post-surgical outcomes are unsatisfactory, merely alleviating symptoms of intestinal obstruction. Up to one-third of HSCR patients continue to experience gastrointestinal issues post-surgery, which severely impacts their growth and development and may even threaten their lives. Cell transplantation represents a promising strategy for the radical treatment of HSCR but faces numerous challenges. The mismatch between transplanted cells and the enteric niches is one of the key obstacles in reconstructing the enteric nervous system through cell transplantation. There is an urgent need to \"get to the root of the problem\" to enhance our understanding of the enteric niches and overcome current limitations. This review synthesizes insights from two metaphorical narratives, \"Blind Men and the Elephant\" and \"Rags To Riches,\" to provide a comprehensive re-understanding of the enteric niches and their potential for enteric neurogenesis. By examining these narratives, we underscore the importance of the enteric niches in the potential for transformative discoveries in HSCR research."

    "abstract": "Chronic enteropathy associated with SLCO2A1 gene (CEAS) is a rare protein-losing enteropathy primarily recognized in Asia. Its uncommon nature and limited research usually complicate diagnosis and treatment. This review examines the course of a pediatric patient with CEAS, who underwent three surgeries during medical treatment. A 12-year-old girl was referred for significant anemia and hypoalbuminemia during evaluation for short stature. Initial lab results included hemoglobin of 6.1 g/dl, normal CRP, and positive stool tests, without hematochezia. Capsule endoscopy revealed chronic ulcers and strictures in small bowel, and genetic testing identified a variant in SLCO2A1 gene, finally confirming CEAS. Because the capsule kept retained for 19 days, surgical removal was performed. Alongside the incision made at ileum, extensive circular stenoses were observed. Postoperatively, the patient was started on steroid and Azathioprine. After three months, she visited the emergency room with abdominal pain and fever. CT revealed diffuse free air and abscess, but no definite perforation was identified during emergency surgery, suggesting it was sealed-off. Two weeks after discharge, infliximab treatment was initiated. But she returned with vomiting a few days after second infusion. CT showed small bowel ischemia due to closed-loop obstruction, prompting urgent surgery. Multiple fibrotic bands were twisting part of jejunum, but the strictures seemed nearly normalized compared to earlier findings. We concluded that her disease was not worsening, and the last surgery was rather due to postoperative adhesions. This case highlights the challenges in early diagnosis of CEAS, given its rarity and nonspecific symptoms. However, it should be included in differential diagnosis for atypical clinical findings, with genetic testing as a potential diagnostic tool. Also, long-term immunosuppressive therapy often leads to complications requiring multiple surgeries, so minimally invasive approaches should always be considered. Additionally, the resolution of circular stenosis seen in the final surgery during infliximab treatment indicates a reversible component. Further research for effective treatment for CEAS is essential."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumors to affect the digestive tract. These tumors arise from the interstitial cells of Cajal. Although the majority of GISTs occur in the stomach, they can arise anywhere along the GI tract, including the small intestine, colon, esophagus, and very rarely from extra intestinal locations. GISTs mainly affect older adults, with a slight male preponderance. Small size GISTs can be discovered incidentally during imaging or endoscopy. Symptoms vary depending on the location and size of the tumor, those related to the tumor mass effect (abdominal pain, discomfort, distension and a palpable mass), or others presenting with anemia and GI hemorrhage. Contrast-enhanced abdomino-pelvic CT scan is the investigation of choice for staging and follow-up. GISTs are distinguished from other tumors using immunohistochemical test positivity for CD 117and CD 34. Surgery is the standard treatment for localized GISTs followed by risk stratification. Adjuvant imatinib should be considered in all patients with significant risk of recurrence following resection of primary GISTs. Here we describe a series of GISTs presenting at atypical locations, unique presentations, and atypical histologic variants. The first case was a 35-years old female patient who underwent an emergency laparotomy for small bowel obstruction and later diagnosed to have a mesenteric GIST (an extraintestinal GIST). The second case was a 60-year-old male patient who underwent an emergency laparotomy for a small bowel obstruction secondary to an intrabdominal mass and later diagnosed to have a jejunal GIST. The third case was a 72 years old male patient who underwent exploratory laparotomy for gastro-gastric intussusception secondary to gastric GIST. The fourth case was a 55 years old male patient who underwent exploratory laparotomy for gastric GIST with liver secondaries. In immunohistochemistry examination, all were positive for CD 117. Clinical presentation of GISTs depend on the tumor size and location. Small tumors are usually asymptomatic. If symptomatic, the most common clinical manifestations are features of anemia, GI bleeding, compressive symptoms, and intestinal obstruction. The diagnosis of GIST is confirmed using tissue histology and immunohistochemistry tests. Even though GIST constitutes the smallest portion of GI neoplasms, physicians need to have high index of suspicion for it in patients presenting with vague abdominal pain and consider abdominopelvic CT as part of patients' work up."

    "abstract": "Background: Open appendicectomy is a painful procedure requiring multimodal analgesia. Various fascial planes have been used successfully in the past as part of this multimodal analgesia like TAP block, quadratus lumborum block, and even local infiltration. All of these analgesic regimes have been shown to reduce intra- and postoperative opioid consumption. In this case series, we elaborate on the effects of ESPB on the consumption of opioids in the intra- and postoperative periods of two patients undergoing open appendicectomy. Case Series: Two American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Emergency (1E) patients scheduled to undergo open appendicectomy were consented to receive ESPB after receiving GA. The block was performed at the transverse process at T12 level, on the right side with 30 mLs of 0.25% levobupivacaine. One patient received intra-op IV paracetamol and ketorolac, while the other patient did not receive paracetamol as he already received it in the ward and ketorolac was withheld due to high creatinine. The surgeries went uneventful. Both patients reported 0 NRS pain score in PACU. One of the patients recorded 0 NRS pain score till discharge, and the other reported an NRS score of 5/10 at 19 h 30 min. Both were discharged from the hospital after 24 h. Conclusion: ESPB has a potential opioid sparing effect and can provide a total morphine free analgesia both in the intra- and postoperative period in the setting of an open appendicectomy."

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB), primarily recognized as a pulmonary disease, can manifest in various extrapulmonary forms, with abdominal tuberculosis (ATB) being one of the most common. Abdominal tuberculosis is one of the diseases known as \"the great imitator\" - it can mimic the clinical presentation of various diseases that are more common, such as appendicitis, acute cholecystitis, colitis, and some malignant diseases such as colon or stomach neoplasms. Diagnosis of ATB is often delayed, especially if a clinician in a nonendemic country does not include ATB in the differential diagnosis. Given the rising migration of people from the endemic to the nonendemic countries, we believe it is mandatory to raise consciousness about this clinical entity, as well as to lower a threshold to include ATB in the differential diagnosis. We present a case of a 31-year-old patient from Nepal, who was admitted through the emergency department of General Hospital Zabok, Croatia, with signs of acute abdomen, later successfully diagnosed and treated for ATB. We also deliver a brief literature review, summarizing the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms for ATB. Migrations are inevitably changing the vaccination status and epidemiological risks of any host country. Medical personnel should keep upgrading and revising their knowledge of the \"usual suspects\" whilst differentially diagnosing both immigrants and non-immigrants, in order to make timely and good quality diagnosis and treatment."

Computed tomography (CT) imaging has become instrumental in accurate diagnosis and management planning, though clinicians must carefully balance its benefits against radiation exposure concerns and resource allocation constraints. To comprehensively evaluate the diagnostic accuracy, utility and clinical implications of CT in patients with acute lower abdominal pain, emphasizing rare anatomical variations, pregnancy-related issues, and practical limitations of other imaging modalities in emergency settings in Japan. This retrospective review included 230 patients who underwent CT scans for acute lower abdominal pain at Juntendo University Shizuoka Hospital throughout 2014. CT findings were systematically correlated with the final clinical diagnoses. Cases with diagnostic uncertain underwent independent reviewed by two experienced radiologists. The CT protocols included portal venous-phase imaging with selective arterial-phase acquisition when clinically indicated. Idiopathic pain was the most common diagnosis (104 cases, 45.2%), followed by appendicitis (46 cases, 20.0%) and diverticulitis (27 cases, 11.7%). Right lower quadrant pain predominantly revealed appendicitis (20.2%), whereas left lower quadrant pain frequently indicated diverticulitis (12.1%). Nonspecific pain cases have diverse etiologies. Rare conditions included situs inversus (one case) and intestinal malrotation (one case). Pregnancy-related diagnoses included acute appendicitis and uterine fibroid degeneration. CT significantly aids in the diagnosis of lower abdominal pain, especially given limited access to ultrasonography and MRI during emergency hours in Japan. Awareness of the anatomical variations and pregnancy-related constraints is crucial. Diagnosis-specific protocols for CT based on pain location can optimize clinical management and resource utilization."

This systematic review synthesizes evidence on QOL outcomes following emergency laparotomy, with a focus on emergency medicine perspectives, including recovery trajectories, influencing factors, and implications for clinical practice. A comprehensive search of PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. In total, 11 studies were included, encompassing prospective and retrospective cohorts, cross-sectional surveys, and one randomized controlled trial. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Narrative synthesis was performed due to heterogeneity in QOL measures. Key findings revealed significant variability in QOL recovery. Survivors of peritonitis without malignancy reported acceptable QOL, while cancer and advanced age predicted worse outcomes. Chronic pain affected 19-45% of patients, particularly after small bowel obstruction surgery, and was linked to long-term functional impairment. Laparoscopy improved QOL in elderly patients compared to laparotomy. Frailty and prolonged hospitalization were associated with declines in physical and social functioning. Patient-reported outcome measures were feasible in emergency settings but highlighted unmet needs in psychological and social recovery. Emergency laparotomy significantly impacts QOL, with recovery shaped by surgical approach, comorbidities, and postoperative pain. Standardized QOL assessment, integrated multidisciplinary care, and targeted rehabilitation are needed to optimize long-term outcomes. Future research should prioritize prospective studies with uniform QOL metrics to guide patient-centered interventions."

This can lead to small bowel obstruction, bowel incarceration, and strangulation. We present a rare case of an adult patient presenting with an acute abdomen caused by small bowel strangulation due to a congenital transmesenteric defect. A 67-year-old female without any significant past medical or surgical history presented to the emergency department with an acute-onset worsening abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting. Physical examination revealed pain out of proportion to palpation of the abdomen. CT demonstrated internal hernia with moderate-volume ascites, concerning for ischemic bowel. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, which demonstrated an internal hernia through a congenital mesenteric defect in the right hemiabdomen near the root of the mesentery with ischemic small bowel requiring resection. The patient was left in intestinal discontinuity and was returned for reexploration of the abdomen, open cholecystectomy, and right hemicolectomy. The patient's recovery and hospital course were uncomplicated, and she was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day five. The incidence of congenital mesenteric defects in adults is exceedingly low, resulting in a limited body of literature addressing their clinical presentation and complications. Timely and accurate preoperative diagnosis is critical to prevent acute obstruction and strangulation of the bowel. This case contributes valuable insights into the diagnosis and management of this uncommon condition."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is defined as an acute scrotal emergency that occurs in adolescents. It requires intervention within 6 h to avoid necrosis due to ischemia of the testis caused by seminal torsion. The etiology of testicular torsion is mostly associated with anatomical abnormalities, such as pendulum malformation. The clinical presentation is characterized by sudden onset of scrotal pain. Ultrasound is used in combination with the TWIST scoring system to improve diagnostic accuracy. Early surgical exploration is central to treatment; however, delayed diagnosis and treatment lead to an orchiectomy rate of up to 71%. Perioperative pain, inflammatory irritation, or prolonged bed rest may induce torsion; however, reports of postoperative secondary testicular torsion are rare and require clinical vigilance. A 14-year-old male patient presented with sudden onset of right scrotal swelling and pain 24 h after undergoing laparoscopic surgery for acute appendicitis. A detailed ultrasonographic examination revealed a significant reduction in blood flow to the patient's right testis, leading to a diagnosis of 720° testicular torsion with infarction. The patient's family expressed a preference for preservation of the testis, and thus, following sodium heparinisation of the spermatic cord, the incision of testicular tunica albuginea was performed to achieve testicular decompression. Postoperative and intraoperative evaluations demonstrated restoration of blood flow. However, a 3-month follow-up revealed atrophy of the affected testis (1.9 × 1.3 × 1.1 cm) with a 55% reduction in size. This rare instance of postoperative testicular torsion underscores the necessity for enhanced perioperative monitoring of the genital region, particularly in cases involving anatomical abnormalities and risk factors. Despite the short-term benefits of innovative interventions in improving blood supply, the resultant ischemia-reperfusion injury led to irreversible atrophy. Combining ultrasound with TWIST scoring has been shown to enhance the diagnostic process; however, its sensitivity to early torsion remains limited, necessitating vigilance for dynamic changes. The preservation of the necrotic testis has been demonstrated to reduce psychological stress; however, the long-term risks of atrophy, infertility, and malignancy require adequate information about prognosis."

Postoperative anticoagulation was initiated, and thrombophilia screening ruled out hypercoagulable disorders, classifying the SMVT as idiopathic. SMVT presents insidiously with abdominal pain, vomiting, and distension; late features include peritonitis and hemodynamic instability. CECT remains the diagnostic gold standard with >90 % accuracy. Management algorithms stratify patients by stability and ischemia severity: stable patients may respond to anticoagulation alone, while those with infarction require prompt surgical resection and possible stoma formation. Lifelong or extended anticoagulation is advocated in idiopathic cases to prevent recurrence. This case underscores that idiopathic SMVT, although rare and often diagnostically challenging, can rapidly progress to life-threatening bowel gangrene even in the absence of known risk factors. Timely diagnosis using contrast-enhanced CT and a multidisciplinary approach-including prompt surgical intervention and postoperative anticoagulation-are critical to improving survival and reducing long-term morbidity. This case reinforces the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion and implementing early, coordinated management in suspected mesenteric ischemia."

    "abstract": "Adult intussusception is rare, representing 1% of all small bowel obstructions. The most common cause of adult intussusception is a pathological lead point such as a malignancy. Presenting symptoms can vary, and computed tomography (CT) imaging can aid in the preoperative diagnosis. A 27-year-old male presented to the emergency department with several weeks of diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. A CT scan revealed an abnormal ileocolic configuration with intussusception of the distal ileal loop through the cecum causing a high-grade small bowel obstruction. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy to relieve the small bowel obstruction caused by the intussusception. A mass was identified intraoperatively which was originating from the terminal ileum. Pathological analysis determined the mass to be Burkitt lymphoma. When adult intussusception is identified, there must be a low index of suspicion for a malignant cause. Burkitt lymphoma was definitively diagnosed after primary resection with histopathology and immunohistochemistry."

    "title": "Aortic dilation might be a risk factor for early cardiac perforation after interventional closure of patent foramen ovale: a case report.",
    "abstract": "Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is present in ∼20% of adults and is associated with cryptogenic stroke, recurrent transient neurological deficit, decompression illness, and migraines. In patients with high probability of a PFO-related ischaemic event, the preferred management strategy is the endovascular closure of the PFO, whenever feasible. Cardiac erosion or perforation is an unusual event after the interventional closure of a PFO, but its occurrence portends a life-threatening potential. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of this serious complication when faced with acute cardiac tamponade in a patient with a history of PFO closure. We report the case of a 57-year-old man, with a recent PFO-related ischaemic stroke, who presented for elective endovascular closure of the PFO. Patent foramen ovale and surrounding structures seemed amenable for closure, and recommended a 25-mm Amplatzer device. Isolated dilation of the aortic bulb was noted by transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE), but with normal valve morphology and no aortic regurgitation. The procedure was performed without complications, and 24 h echo follow-up showed no impingement of the device on the surrounding structures. However, 36 h after the procedure, the patient developed sudden chest pain and cardiac tamponade. Emergency cardiac surgery with intra-operative TEE guidance revealed right atrial and aortic bulb perforation caused by the larger right disc of the occluder. The device was removed, and the defects were sutured. The patient was discharged within 14 days after the event, with no further complications. Perforation of the aortic root is a very rare complication after interventional PFO closure. This complication usually occurs at a long distance after the procedure, and is associated with oversized devices, deficient or absent aortic rim, or misalignment of the defect with the aorta. Our patient presented none of the above, but a moderate dilation of the aortic bulb, which might have triggered the rapid erosion and perforation."

    "abstract": "Acute abdomen is a common presentation in the emergency department, requiring prompt evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment. This case report highlights how simple diagnostic tools can facilitate early detection of abdominal pain caused by duodenal perforation-a rare complication in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. We present a novel case of a 62-year-old male with locally advanced pancreatic cancer who developed acute abdominal pain. The diagnosis of intestinal perforation was made at a Specialist Palliative Care clinic within a tertiary cancer centre. An erect abdominal X-ray revealed free air under the diaphragm, pointing to bowel perforation. The patient underwent emergency surgical exploration, which confirmed a duodenal perforation and was managed with a palliative gastrojejunostomy. While point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) was not used in this case, we emphasize its potential utility as a bedside tool in the emergency setting for early evaluation of acute abdomen. It can aid in differentiating between conditions such as bowel obstruction, perforation, intussusception, abscesses, or large masses compressing vital structures-many of which may not be visible on a plain abdominal X-ray. This case underscores the importance of early clinical evaluation and the use of accessible diagnostic tools (POCUS) in the timely management of acute abdomen, particularly in complex cancer cases."

    "abstract": "Alimentary tract duplications, or enterocystomas, are relatively uncommon developmental anomalies that can occur anywhere from the mouth to the anus. One-third of these enteric duplications present within the neonatal period, while the remaining two-thirds appear within the first two years of life. However, some cases may manifest in later childhood or even adulthood. The diagnosis is often incidental, though patients may present with abdominal pain or obstructive symptoms. In certain cases, these lesions can serve as leading points for intussusception in children, which is a common cause of emergency surgical admission in pediatric surgical units. We present the case of a 15-month-old male child who was admitted to our pediatric surgery unit with acute intestinal obstruction due to intussusception. Clinical evaluation and ultrasonography confirmed the diagnosis of bowel obstruction secondary to intussusception. During surgery, the intussusception was found to involve the distal ileum, cecum, ascending colon, and extended through the transverse colon down to the rectum. A cystic mass in the cecum, identified as the lead point, was observed causing the bowel segments to telescope into one another, with the intussuscepted segment protruding through the anal canal. All affected bowel segments were carefully reduced, revealing a cystic mass in the proximal cecum serving as the lead point for intussusception. A Meckel's diverticulum was also identified at a distinct site in the ileum, proximal to the location of the intussusception. A right hemicolectomy and Meckel's diverticulectomy were performed, followed by the creation of a diverting loop ileostomy. Histopathological examination confirmed the lesion to be a duplicated cyst. The postoperative course was uneventful. This report highlights a rare coexistence of cecal duplication cyst and Meckel's diverticulum causing intussusception, a combination scarcely reported in pediatric surgical emergencies."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency, but its diagnosis can be challenging in patients with hematologic malignancies or chemotherapy-induced leukopenia due to an impaired inflammatory response. The clinical presentation of acute appendicitis in these patients is often atypical, leading to delayed or misdiagnosis. This study aims to evaluate the outcomes of appendectomy in patients with hematologic malignancies or chemotherapy-induced leukopenia and assess the applicability of clinical scoring systems for the diagnosis of an acute appendicitis. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with hematologic malignancies or chemotherapy-related leukopenia who underwent appendectomy for suspected acute appendicitis between 2007 and 2023. Clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging results were reviewed. The accuracy and relevance of clinical scoring systems for diagnosing acute appendicitis in these patients were also evaluated. Our study included 12 patients with hematologic malignancies or chemotherapy-induced leukopenia who underwent appendectomy. Atypical clinical presentations were common, with a lower frequency of fever, elevated leukocytes, and other typical inflammatory markers. Only one patient developed postoperative complications (acute kidney failure), and none of the patients died due to appendicitis. Clinical scoring systems demonstrated limited applicability in this patient population, often underestimating the likelihood of appendicitis. Diagnosing acute appendicitis in patients with hematologic malignancies or chemotherapy-induced leukopenia poses significant challenges, as standard scoring systems prove unreliable. The presence of abdominal pain coupled with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels should prompt a multidisciplinary evaluation and timely imaging. Surgical therapies, particularly laparoscopic approaches, appear safe and feasible in these patients. Ongoing research is essential to refine surgical strategies for the growing population of immunocompromised individuals."

    "abstract": "This article presents a rare case of a necrotizing soft tissue infection secondary to a strangulated and perforated femoral hernia. The patient had presented several days after the onset of symptoms and was in septic shock due to spillage of intestinal contents into the thigh. Urgent operative management was undertaken to obtain source control and debride the significant necrotic tissue that was present. Additionally, small bowel resection via a midline laparotomy was required as the bowel was necrotic on intraoperative evaluation. Specific management challenges included the closure of hernia defect in an infected field and the complex wound care regimen necessitated by the extent of tissue necrosis. Prompt surgical intervention, in the setting of a necrotizing soft tissue infection, is imperative to achieving a favorable outcome.

    "abstract": "Foreign body ingestion and sensation are common clinical conditions encountered in emergency and outpatient settings. True foreign body ingestion typically involves a history of swallowing a foreign object and is often confirmed by radiographic findings. The management of foreign body ingestion depends on the type, size, and location of the object, as well as the patient's symptoms. High-risk objects, such as button/disk batteries, multiple magnets, and sharp objects, often require urgent or emergent endoscopic removal to prevent severe complications such as perforation, obstruction, and fistula formation. Imaging is crucial for diagnosis and management, with radiographs being the first-line modality and CT offering superior sensitivity for detecting radiolucent objects and complications. Mimickers of foreign body ingestion and sensations, even without the presence of an actual foreign body, arise from motility disorders (e.g., achalasia), structural or mucosal abnormalities (e.g., Zenker's diverticulum, reflux esophagitis, and esophageal strictures), and extrinsic compression. Although these mimickers produce similar symptoms, they require different diagnostic approaches. This review highlights the radiological findings, management strategies for various foreign bodies, and the distinguishing features of their mimickers, emphasizing the importance of timely and accurate differentiation to guide appropriate interventions and improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the association between prophylactic negative-pressure wound therapy (pNPWT) using the open method and incisional surgical site infection (SSI) following emergency lower gastrointestinal surgery. We retrospectively examined 210 consecutive patients who underwent emergency surgery for lower gastrointestinal tract perforation or necrosis at a single center between January 2018 and March 2023. Outcomes were compared between patients who received pNPWT and those who received conventional wound management. Propensity score analyses included multivariate analysis using the propensity score in the crude cohort, inverse probability of treatment weighting, and 1:2 nearest-neighbor matching. The primary endpoint was the incidence of incisional SSI and the secondary endpoints were wound healing time, postoperative hospital stay, identification of incisional SSI risk factors, and determination of optimal pNPWT management. In the crude cohort (pNPWT = 41, conventional = 169), incisional SSI occurred in 11 (26.8%) and 65 (38.5%) patients, respectively (P = .227). After propensity score analyses, pNPWT was significantly associated with a reduction in incisional SSI, with odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of 0.344 (0.147-0.804; P = .002), 0.260 (0.103-0.794; P = .002), and 0.285 (0.106-0.763; P = .012) in the multivariate analysis, inverse probability of treatment weighting, and propensity score-matched cohort (pNPWT = 30, conventional = 60), respectively. Wound healing time and postoperative hospital stay did not differ significantly between the groups. Risk factors for incisional SSI were poor American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status and perforation, with the addition of conventional wound management. Early application of pNPWT (≤2 days postoperatively) further reduced the incidence of SSI (17.6% vs 71.4%; P = .010). In propensity score analyses, pNPWT was associated with a significant reduction in incisional SSI in contaminated abdominal wounds after lower gastrointestinal surgery. Early application may enhance its effectiveness. pNPWT should be considered for high-risk patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery."

    "abstract": "Complications of peptic ulcers, such as bleeding, gastric outlet obstruction, and perforation, can be life-threatening and may require surgical intervention. Perforated peptic ulcer (PPU) presents mostly as a surgical emergency and is one of the leading causes of secondary peritonitis with significant morbidity and mortality. The clinical outcome of surgical treatment of peptic ulcers varies due to the varying patterns of presentations and interventions between countries. There are few documented series on PPU in Nigeria. This paper reviews the management outcome of PPU in our institution. A retrospective review of the available medical records of patients managed for PPU between February 2008 and February 2023 was conducted. All patients had a single anterior peptic ulcer perforation managed by a modified Graham's patch. Data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS for Windows, Version 23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). There were 107 PPU patients comprising 93 males and 14 females. The mean age of all patients was 41 years. The peak prevalence of PPU was found among patients aged 30-39 years. Delayed presentation was recorded in about half of the patients. Ingestion of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was the most common risk factor for PPU. Among the 93 documented cases, perforated gastric ulcers (71 cases) were found in a much higher proportion than duodenal ulcers (22 cases). Large ulcer (10-30 mm) was the main perforation size category found in 47 out of 83 recorded PPU cases. PPU size was not associated with the incidence of complications or mortality. The median duration of hospital stays was 13 (1-19) days. Surgical site infection was the most common complication after surgery. PPU is present in our predominantly male patients in their fourth decade of life. Ingestion of NSAIDs is a major risk factor. Duodenal ulcers were the predominant type seen in our patients. Documented perforated ulcer sizes in our patients are predominantly in the large category. Surgical site infection, systemic sepsis, and superficial wound infection were major complications in our patients."

    "abstract": "Perforated gastric cancer (PGC) is a rare but life-threatening surgical emergency. Due to its low reported incidence and significant challenges in the preoperative diagnosis of malignancy, there is no established consensus on optimal management. Recent evidence suggests that a two-stage surgical strategy, involving initial damage control followed by delayed curative resection, may reduce morbidity and mortality while improving oncological outcomes. Preoperative diagnosis of malignancy is uncommon, and the utility of routine intraoperative biopsy has been questioned, highlighting the importance of postoperative endoscopic biopsy for definitive diagnosis. This study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a two-stage surgical strategy for PGC, emphasizing its adaptability and outcomes based on a 27-year retrospective analysis at a single institution. We retrospectively reviewed 62 cases of gastric perforation treated between 1998 and October 2023. Among them, nine cases were pathologically confirmed as PGC. Initial management involved conservative therapy or omental patch repair (via laparotomy or laparoscopy) aimed at stabilizing the patient's condition and managing peritonitis. Following malignancy confirmation (often by postoperative biopsy) and clinical stabilization, elective curative gastrectomy with appropriate lymphadenectomy was planned for eligible patients. Postoperative outcomes, including complications (graded by Clavien-Dindo), curative resection rates, and survival, were analyzed. Of the nine PGC patients (median age 74 years), none were diagnosed preoperatively. Initial management included conservative therapy (n=3), open omental patch repair (n=3), and laparoscopic omental patch repair (n=3). No Clavien-Dindo grade III or higher complications were observed following initial management. Eight patients subsequently underwent gastrectomy, with seven achieving R0 resection. One patient succumbed to cancer progression during hospitalization prior to the planned gastrectomy. For the seven patients who underwent R0 resection, the median follow-up was 24 months (range: 12-56 months). At the final data cut-off (April 2025), three of these seven R0 patients were alive and disease-free; one had died from cancer recurrence, and three were lost to follow-up while alive. Notably, one complex case with initial peritoneal dissemination (Case 6) successfully underwent delayed radical resection after chemotherapy, illustrating the strategy's adaptability. Conversely, Case 7 exemplified a straightforward and successful two-stage laparoscopic approach, resulting in long-term disease-free survival. This patient is one of the three currently alive. This retrospective study suggests that a two-stage surgical strategy, involving initial stabilization followed by elective curative gastrectomy, is a safe and effective approach for managing PGC. It achieved high rates of R0 resection with low morbidity and demonstrated promising survival outcomes in this high-risk cohort. Further multicenter prospective studies are needed to establish standardized protocols and validate patient selection criteria."

    "abstract": "Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) remains a life-threatening vascular emergency, with significant clinical challenges despite advances in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. This systematic review compared the efficacy and outcomes of endovascular versus open surgical interventions in AMI management. A comprehensive search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library was conducted from database inception through February 15, 2025, yielding six retrospective cohort studies that met inclusion criteria. Endovascular intervention was associated with lower in-hospital mortality compared to open surgery in most studies. Patients undergoing endovascular therapy demonstrated significantly lower bowel resection rates and preserved intestinal length. Additional benefits included shorter hospital stays, reduced ICU length of stay, and fewer complications, including acute renal failure and pulmonary complications. However, endovascular approaches were associated with higher reintervention rates. Independent predictors of mortality included elevated lactate concentration, pneumatosis intestinalis, increased white blood cell count, chronic renal insufficiency, and extensive bowel necrosis. Endovascular therapy represents a promising approach for AMI management, particularly in patients without evidence of bowel necrosis at presentation, though careful patient selection and vigilant monitoring are essential due to higher reintervention rates. Prospective studies are needed to better define optimal treatment strategies for different AMI patient subgroups."

An enterectomy and end-to-end anastomosis were performed to remove the perforated diverticulum. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the infant was discharged on the eighth postoperative day. Histopathological examination confirmed the presence of a perforated MD with ectopic gastric mucosa. This report summarizes and characterizes the presentation, diagnosis, and management of this rare complication."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a rare yet life-threatening event in pregnancy. If not diagnosed and treated promptly, it can lead to an increase in maternal as well as foetal morbidity and mortality. In the majority of cases, small bowel obstruction is caused by adhesions from previous pelvic surgeries. We herein report a case of SBO in a 28-week pregnant woman, who had a previous history of laparotomy for ectopic pregnancy. She presented with severe epigastric pain and vomiting in the emergency department. On initial examination, the patient was clinically stable but with a distended abdomen. Abdominal ultrasound showed fluid-filled dilated small bowel loops, but was otherwise unremarkable. Conservative treatment was provided, and she was kept on nothing by mouth. Despite intravenous pain killers and antiemetics, the symptoms remained unsettled 72 hours after admission. A clinical suspicion of SBO was made, and an urgent MRI was carried out, suggesting small bowel obstruction. She underwent an immediate laparotomy. Intraoperatively, bands of omentum were found to be adherent to the distal ileum. The adhesions were resected, and the affected ileum showed no signs of ischaemia, so it was preserved. Her postoperative course was uneventful. She later had a caesarean section for intrauterine growth restriction at 37 weeks and delivered a 2.1 kg baby. Diagnosis of SBO is difficult, especially in the second and third trimesters, as the symptoms often are mistakenly attributed to the pregnancy itself. There is a reluctance in getting investigations such as a CT scan done due to the risk of exposure of the foetus to ionising radiation which can lead to a delay in diagnosis and treatment. MRI can safely be used in pregnancy as a modality to diagnose intestinal obstruction and to determine the aetiology. Once diagnosed, the optimal management mainly depends on the aetiology and the gestational age."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is an abdominal medical emergency and can be of various types. It can lead to a series of gastrointestinal symptoms and can affect health status. Therefore, attention should be paid to the diagnosis of appendicitis to improve prognosis. To assess the value of transabdominal superficial ultrasonography (TASU) in the clinical diagnosis of various types of appendicitis. A total of 100 patients suspected to have acute appendicitis that were admitted to our hospital between July 2022 and July 2024 were selected for this study. All of them underwent conventional abdominal ultrasonography and TASU. Taking surgical pathology as the gold standard, the diagnostic efficacy of the two ultrasonographic examinations was compared, and the ultrasonographic features of patients with different types of appendicitis were analyzed. Comparison with the gold standard showed that among the 100 patients suspected of appendicitis, 72 cases were diagnosed as appendicitis while 28 cases were deemed to be normal. Compared with conventional abdominal ultrasonography, TASU displayed a higher diagnostic efficiency (P < 0.05). Among the 72 patients with acute appendicitis, 22 cases were diagnosed as simple appendicitis, 26 cases as suppurative appendicitis, and 24 cases as gangrenous appendicitis. TASU was more effective in the diagnosis of the various types of appendicitis, and the difference was significant between groups (P < 0.05). Ultrasonography radiographs revealed an enlarged appendix with a tubular anechoic area, a widened lumen, with a visible occlusion or stercoral shadow and a cystic mass in the parenchyma. TASU can accurately diagnose appendicitis and also be used to identify the various types of appendicitis, thereby having application value."

    "abstract": "Cystic lymphangioma is a benign tumor resulting from the proliferation of thin-walled lymphatic spaces. It is most commonly located in the head and neck region (70%), followed by the axillary regions (20%), and more rarely in internal organs (10%). Mesenteric lymphangioma of the small intestine is a rare entity, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 250,000, accounting for less than 1% of all lymphangiomas. Although typically asymptomatic, it can present with acute abdominal pain in the event of complications such as volvulus, hemorrhage, or rupture, thereby necessitating urgent surgical intervention. We report the case of a 12-year-old girl admitted to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain and signs of bowel obstruction evolving over 3 days. Clinical examination revealed peri-umbilical tenderness, and radiological investigations demonstrated a small bowel volvulus associated with a cystic lesion suggestive of a cystic lymphangioma. The diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological analysis following surgical management, which included resection of the cyst and the necrotic intestinal loop."

    "title": "Outcome of Exteriorization of the Anastomotic Site in Case of Emergency Bowel Surgery.",
    "abstract": "Anastomotic leakage followed by septic peritonitis is the most serious complication following intestinal surgery. It has an impact on overall postoperative morbidity and mortality. To prevent the complications of intraperitoneal anastomotic leakage, exteriorization of the anastomosis provides a good alternative. The exteriorized anastomosis can be safely dropped back to the peritoneal cavity after healing in the same hospital admission. If anastomotic leakage occurs, then this exteriorized anastomosis can be converted into an ordinary stoma. The main goal of the present study is to assess the feasibility and to see the outcomes of an exteriorized intestinal anastomosis in emergency bowel surgery. This prospective observational study was carried out in the Department of Surgery, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh from November 2018 to May 2019. Twenty (20) patients who underwent emergency laparotomy with bowel anastomosis were included in this study. The anastomosis was then exteriorized followed by a drop back to the peritoneal cavity if there was no leak from the anastomosis. Immediate complications were noted and managed accordingly as leaked anastomosis was fashioned as a stoma. The exteriorized anastomosis was successfully dropped back into the peritoneal cavity in 75.0% of cases and was possible between the 6th to 10th postoperative days. Anastomotic leak in the exteriorized segment was seen in 25.0% of patients. No added morbidity or mortality was found in leaked exteriorized anastomosis rather than they were fashioned as an ordinary stoma. One patient underwent re-operation for a pelvic abscess which was usually not related to anastomotic leakage and there was no leak after drop back. The mean hospital stay was up to 11.07th postoperative day (POD), ranging from 8th to 30th postoperative day (POD) after successful drop back of exteriorized anastomosis. But after leaked anastomosis, it was the 18th POD which was more due to prolonged management of wound infection with co-morbidities but not due to leakage-related complications. During the study process 2(10.0%) patients died, one due to ARDS and the other due to severe sepsis with complications of a burst abdomen which was also not related to anastomotic leakage. The procedure of exteriorized gut anastomosis has the advantage of shorter hospital stays and can avoid stoma formation, one-stage surgery and single hospital admission. It does not add any morbidity to the patient but also can early detect anastomotic leakage by direct visualization of the anastomotic site and can be converted to an ordinary stoma. So, exteriorized gut anastomosis can be an alternative to the formation of stoma as well as prevent complications of intra-peritoneal anastomotic leak."

    "abstract": "Among foreign body ingestions in children, button battery ingestion is becoming increasingly common. When the battery is impacted in the oesophagus, the risk of complications is significant. The aim of this study was to share our experience in managing children with oesophageal button battery impaction and assess the occurrence of short-term and long-term complications. This was a retrospective study conducted at a tertiary French paediatric centre. Children with oesophageal button battery impaction managed between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2022 were included. Clinical data, endoscopic findings and treatments were recorded at battery removal and during follow-up at 1 week and at 1, 3 and 12 months. Complications were noted at each follow-up. Patients were compared based on the presence or absence of complications to identify associated risk factors. Among 79 children included in the study, 31 experienced one or more complications by 12 months postingestion: oesophageal stenosis (n=14), mediastinitis (n=18), tracheoesophageal fistula (n=3), oesophageal perforation (n=5) and vocal cord paralysis (n=3). Most complications were diagnosed within the first week, except for oesophageal stenosis, which had an average delay of 38.2 days. Risk factors for complications included younger age, longer time to battery removal and oesophageal mucosal necrosis observed during follow-up endoscopy 1 week postremoval. The rate of complications following oesophageal button battery impaction remains high. However, protocolised management involving rapid battery extraction, early endoscopic review and intraoperative nasogastric tube placement may reduce the risk of severe complications and oesophageal stenosis."

    "abstract": "Abdominal pain is a common reason for children to attend the Emergency Department (ED) with acute appendicitis being the most common surgical cause. Various clinical prediction scores (CPSs) have been developed to assist in determining the risk of appendicitis; however, CPSs have been inadequately validated in children and haphazardly adopted in Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) EDs. This study aims to compare and validate various CPSs for diagnosing pediatric appendicitis in children presenting to ANZ EDs. This prospective multicenter observational study across 10 ANZ EDs is recruiting children 5-17 years presenting to participating EDs with acute right-sided or generalized abdominal pain lasting ≤7 days and clinician suspicion of appendicitis. CPSs will be calculated by the study team from clinician-recorded data and clinician gestalt recorded on a visual analog scale. Accuracy of CPSs will be assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and proportions correctly identified as either low-risk or high-risk based on the CPSs published cutoffs. The final diagnosis of appendicitis will be confirmed on histopathology, and the absence of appendicitis confirmed by telephone, email, or a combination of both to follow up for those discharged directly from ED. This study received funding in July 2023 and started enrolment in August 2023. As of October 2024, we have enrolled and completed follow-up on 1227 participants with an expected end date in mid-2025. This study aims to determine the best-performing CPS for diagnosing pediatric appendicitis in ANZ EDs. Implementation of this CPS in ANZ EDs has the potential to reduce health care costs, rationalize the use of health care resources, and improve the management and outcomes of childhood appendicitis.

    "abstract": "The purpose of the study was to determine the spectrum of diseases of surgical acute abdomen by ultrasonography and comparing the ultrasound diagnosis with the surgical diagnosis of acute abdominal conditions in a low-income resource setting. A prospective observational study was conducted on consecutive patients presenting with acute abdomen to the radiology department for abdominal ultrasonography. The ultrasound diagnosis was compared with the surgical diagnosis. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used for association, and Kappa statistics was used for interobserver agreement. Diagnostic performance markers included sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnostic accuracy. The most common conditions included appendicitis (27.5%), bowel perforation (21.7%), and ectopic pregnancy (12.5%). Ultrasonography had an overall sensitivity of 80.8%, specificity of 99.1%, PPV of 89.0%, NPV of 98.3%, and diagnostic accuracy of 97.6%. Sensitivities of 69.7%, 88.5%, 100.0%, and specificities of 98.9%, 96.8%, 100.0% were seen for acute appendicitis, bowel perforation, and ectopic pregnancy, respectively. There was a significant relationship between ultrasound and surgical diagnosis of most of the acute abdominal conditions (P < 0.001) except for appendiceal abscess (P = 0.05). Ultrasound and surgical diagnosis of all the acute abdominal conditions showed beyond chance kappa (κ) interobserver agreement (0.20< κ ≤1.00). With skilled hands, there is high concordance between ultrasound and surgical diagnosis of acute abdomen. Ultrasonography should be part of the initial evaluation of patients with surgical acute abdomen in a setting where emergency abdominal computed tomography is not readily available, accessible, and affordable. Résumé Introduction:L’objectif de cette étude était de déterminer le spectre des pathologies de l’abdomen aigu chirurgical par échographie et de comparer le diagnostic échographique au diagnostic chirurgical des affections abdominales aiguës dans un contexte de ressources à faibles revenus.Matériel et méthodes:Une étude observationnelle prospective a été menée auprès de patients consécutifs se présentant au service de radiologie pour une échographie abdominale pour un abdomen aigu. Le diagnostic échographique a été comparé au diagnostic chirurgical. Les tests du Chi carré et exact de Fisher ont été utilisés pour la corrélation, et la statistique Kappa pour la concordance interobservateur. Les marqueurs de performance diagnostique comprenaient la sensibilité, la spécificité, la valeur prédictive positive (VPP), la valeur prédictive négative (VPN) et la précision diagnostique.Résultats:Les affections les plus fréquentes étaient l’appendicite (27,5 %), la perforation intestinale (21,7 %) et la grossesse extra-utérine (12,5 %). L’échographie avait une sensibilité globale de 80,8 %, une spécificité de 99,1 %, une VPP de 89 %, une VPN de 98,3 % et une précision diagnostique de 97,6 %. Des sensibilités de 69,7 %, 88,5 %, 100 %, et des spécificités de 98,9 %, 96,8 %, 100 %, ont été observées respectivement pour l’appendicite aiguë, la perforation intestinale et la grossesse extra-utérine. Il existait une corrélation significative entre l’échographie et le diagnostic chirurgical pour la plupart des affections abdominales aiguës (P < 0,001), à l’exception de l’abcès appendiculaire (P = 0,05). L’échographie et le diagnostic chirurgical de toutes les affections abdominales aiguës ont montré une concordance interobservateur kappa (κ) au-delà du hasard (0,20 < κ ≤ 1,00).Conclusion:Avec des mains expertes, il existe une forte concordance entre l’échographie et le diagnostic chirurgical de l’abdomen aigu. L’échographie devrait faire partie de l’évaluation initiale des patients présentant un abdomen aigu chirurgical, dans un contexte où la tomodensitométrie abdominale en urgence n’est ni facilement disponible, ni accessible, ni abordable."

Plasma-based next generation circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing revealed mismatch repair deficiency and an exceptionally high tumor mutational burden (TMB) of 1069 mutations/megabase (mut/Mb). Initial management consisted of cytotoxic chemotherapy (FOLFOX; 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) given the urgent need for a clinical response. Following multidisciplinary discussion and shared decision-making, nivolumab was added with cycle 3 of FOLFOX. Transplant-related immunosuppression was adjusted, and pancreas and kidney transplant function were monitored closely. Potential organ rejection was monitored using donor-derived cell-free DNA. Immune-related adverse events were not observed. After 5 cycles of treatment (3 cycles involving nivolumab), she achieved a complete clinical, molecular, and radiographic response. There was minimal evidence of allograft rejection without signs of dysfunction. Treatment was discontinued and subsequent surveillance imaging suggested durable remission for at least 9 months following treatment cessation. This case highlights the importance of genomic testing and targeting actionable molecular alterations in patients with rare cancers, as well as the role of multidisciplinary care."

    "abstract": "Background: Acute appendicitis (AA) is a common surgical emergency worldwide. Over the past few decades, diagnostic imaging has become a cornerstone in the identification of acute appendicitis, significantly contributing to the reduction in unnecessary laparotomies and associated healthcare costs. This study aimed to investigate the influence of serum and spot urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels, as well as other established clinical and biochemical parameters on the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Methods: This prospective study was conducted between January and November 2023, evaluating 97 patients diagnosed with acute appendicitis. Serum and spot urine 5-HIAA levels, level of white blood cell (WBC), neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets, C-reactive protein (CRP), and Alvarado score were analyzed. Patients were further allocated to subgroups based on their Alvarado scores, the onset time of the symptoms, and pathological findings to statistically assess the relationship between the parameters. Results: The mean age of the patients was 34.6 ± 14.8 years. Of the patients, 57 (58.8%) were male, and 40 (41.2%) were female. Spot urine 5-HIAA levels exhibited statistically significant variation among different symptom onset time groups, with elevated levels observed in patients presenting within the first 12 h of symptom onset (p < 0.001). Neutrophil counts were significantly different among Alvarado score groups (p < 0.001), whereas CRP levels significantly increased with the onset time of the symptoms (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Increased spot urine 5-HIAA is supportive of the diagnosis of AA in patients presenting within the first 12 h of symptom onset. Hematological parameters, especially CRP, may provide more reliable information regarding disease severity and progression."

    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Perforated peptic ulcers are a common surgical emergency and rank among the leading causes of acute peritonitis worldwide. Previous studies have suggested a seasonal pattern in the occurrence of symptomatic perforated peptic ulcers. With the advancement of modern medicine, including the widespread use of proton pump inhibitors, and the effects of climate change, this study aimed to assess potential seasonal variations in the incidence of peptic ulcer perforation in our region. Methods: This retrospective analysis included 104 adult patients (mean age: 61.5 ± 14.7 years) who underwent surgical treatment for peptic ulcer perforation between January 2021 and April 2024. Patients were analyzed by gender, age, risk factors (smoking and alcohol consumption), the location of the perforation (gastric or duodenal), and discharge outcome (survived or deceased). Additionally, cases were categorized by the month and season of the ulcer perforation. Results: Among the 104 patients (mean age 61.5 ± 14.7 years), 68 (65.4%) were male. Gastric and duodenal perforations were nearly equally observed (51% vs. 49%). A statistically significant difference in overall perforation rates by gender was observed (p = 0.009), though not between ulcer sites (p = 0.628 and p = 0.739). The highest number of perforations occurred in July (n = 12), while the lowest occurred in November (n = 4); however, no significant variation was found by month (p = 0.916) or season (p = 0.891), despite a predominance in spring. Comorbidities were present in 60% of patients. Smoking (33.6%) and alcohol use (22.1%) were common. Alcohol abuse was noted in 22.1% of patients and was significantly associated with both gastric (p < 0.001) and duodenal (p < 0.001) perforations, though not with the overall incidence (p = 0.284). Smoking, reported in 33.6% of patients, showed no significant association with the perforation site or overall incidence (p = 0.946). The combination of smoking and alcohol use favored gastric perforations, but without statistical significance (p = 0.157). Conclusions: Alcohol consumption appeared to increase the risk of ulcer perforation, while smoking did not demonstrate a statistically significant association. Although spring exhibited the highest observed incidence of peptic ulcer perforation, seasonal variation did not show a statistically significant difference overall."

Bezoars are a rare but significant cause of small bowel obstruction (SBO), even in patients without prior gastrointestinal surgery. We report a case of a 60-year-old man with no surgical history who presented with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and absence of bowel movements. Imaging suggested SBO, and diagnostic laparoscopy confirmed a meat bezoar obstructing the terminal ileum. Histopathological examination revealed thermally altered liver parenchyma, consistent with undigested cooked meat. The bezoar was successfully removed surgically, and the patient recovered without complications. This case underscores the importance of considering bezoars, including rare forms like meat bezoars, in the differential diagnosis of SBO, particularly in patients with nonspecific symptoms.

    "abstract": "Generalized secondary peritonitis is a life-threatening intra-abdominal infection requiring urgent surgical intervention. Despite advances in surgical and antimicrobial therapy, morbidity and mortality remain high. Identifying key prognostic factors is crucial for improving patient outcomes. This review examines significant prognostic indicators and explores the potential role of scoring systems and artificial intelligence in risk stratification. A review was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Medline databases. Studies published from 2000 to 2024 focusing on prognostic factors in secondary peritonitis were included. A total of 145 studies were identified, with 40 selected based on relevance and methodological quality. Data extraction included patient demographics, comorbidities, severity scores, microbiological profiles, and artificial intelligence applications in peritonitis management. Poor prognosis was associated with advanced age, severe sepsis, organ failure, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular comorbidities, and diabetes mellitus. The Mannheim Peritonitis Index (MPI) remains a widely validated prognostic tool, while APACHE II and SOFA scores also provide valuable risk estimates. Increasing multidrug-resistant infections further complicate management and impact outcomes. Emerging evidence suggests that machine learning algorithms may improve early risk stratification and individualized outcome prediction when integrated with conventional scoring systems. Identifying prognostic factors remains essential for optimizing outcomes in secondary peritonitis, and future research should prioritize the clinical validation and integration of AI-based models into perioperative management protocols."

    "abstract": "Background: Oesophageal perforation (OP) is a life-threatening condition requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment. Mortality is influenced by several factors, such as aetiology, defect location, comorbidities, age, and delays in treatment. This study reviews patients with OP undergoing surgery, analysing mortality risks and the impact of timing on surgical outcomes. Methods: Medical records of 45 patients surgically treated for OP across three tertiary centers were analysed. Results: Of the 45 patients, 31 were male (68.88%) and 14 were female (31.11%), with a mean age of 66.00 ± 17.75 years. Pre-operative CT was performed in all patients, and 18 (40%) underwent oesophagogastroduodenoscopy. As many as 25 patients (55.55%) presented within 24 h, 10 (22.22%) within 24-72 h, and 10 (22.22%) after 72 h. Symptoms included pain, vomiting, fever, dysphagia, and subcutaneous emphysema. Foreign body ingestion and Boerhaave's syndrome were the leading causes (33.33% each), followed by caustic ingestion (17.77%) and iatrogenic and traumatic cases. Treatments included primary repair, debridement, oesophagectomy, and oesophagogastrectomy. Primary repair was performed in 22 cases (48.88%), and muscle flaps reinforced 11 of these. Direct repair showed the highest success rate when performed within 24 h. Thirty patients (66.66%) experienced complications, including respiratory failure, oesophagopleural fistula, and sub-stenosis. The hospital stay average was 36.34 ± 35.03 days. Nine patients underwent same-session/two-stage gastroplasty or retrosternal coloplasty for reconstruction, with complications including stenosis and leaks. Six patients (13.33%) died within the first 24 h after surgery, primarily due to severe comorbidities (three (50%) were octogenarians). Conclusions: OP is a life-threatening condition with high mortality. Primary repair is the preferred treatment. Oesophagectomy and gastrectomy are reserved for extensive lesions. Muscle flaps can reinforce sutures in cervical and thoracic perforations. Mortality is mainly influenced by the severity of the patient's clinical picture and comorbidities, rather than by time and type of treatment."

    "abstract": "Background: Among patients with congenital heart disease, particularly those with a history of undergoing the Fontan operation, pregnancy presents a significant maternal-fetal risk, especially when complicated by severe valvular dysfunction. Lung reperfusion syndrome (LRS) is a rare but life-threatening complication occurring following valve intervention. Multidisciplinary management, including by Cardio-Obstetrics teams, is essential for optimizing outcomes in such high-risk cases. Methods: We present the case of a 37-year-old pregnant patient with previously repaired tetralogy of Fallot (via the Fontan procedure) who presented at 24 weeks gestation with worsening severe pulmonary stenosis and right-ventricular dysfunction. The patient had been lost to cardiac follow-up for over a decade. She experienced recurrent arrhythmias, including supraventricular and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, prompting hospital admission. A multidisciplinary team recommended transcatheter pulmonic valve replacement (TPVR), performed at 28 weeks' gestation. Results: Post-TPVR, the patient developed acute hypoxia and hypotension, consistent with Lung Reperfusion Syndrome, necessitating intensive cardiopulmonary support. Despite initial stabilization, progressive maternal respiratory failure and fetal compromise led to an emergent cesarean delivery. The neonate's neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) course was complicated by spontaneous intestinal perforation, while the mother required intensive care unit (ICU)-level care and a bronchoscopy due to new pulmonary findings. She was extubated and discharged in stable condition on postoperative day five. Conclusions: This case underscores the complexity of managing severe congenital heart disease and valve pathology during pregnancy. Lung reperfusion syndrome should be recognized as a potential complication following TPVR, particularly in pregnant patients with Fontan physiology. Early involvement of a multidisciplinary Cardio-Obstetrics team and structured peripartum planning are critical to improving both maternal and neonatal outcomes."

    "abstract": "Intussusception in neonates is extremely rare, especially in full-term newborns. Even rarer is the occurrence of Meckel's diverticulum (MD) acting as a lead point within the first 24 h of life. Prompt recognition is critical as delays can lead to bowel perforation and life-threatening complications. We report a case of a 13-hour-old full-term female neonate who presented with abdominal distension and signs of sepsis shortly after her first feed. Imaging revealed pneumoperitoneum, prompting emergent laparotomy. Intraoperatively, ileoileal intussusception with bowel perforation was identified, with Meckel's diverticulum acting as the lead point. The affected segment was resected with primary anastomosis. The patient required cardiopulmonary resuscitation intraoperatively but eventually made a full recovery after a second-look surgery and NICU support. This case represents one of the earliest presentations of MD-related intussusception complicated by bowel perforation in a term neonate. Diagnosing intussusception in neonates is challenging due to atypical presentation. Although MD is the most common congenital GI anomaly, it rarely presents symptomatically in neonates, let alone as a cause of intussusception and perforation on day one of life. Neonatal intussusception, particularly in term infants, should not be overlooked in the differential diagnosis of early abdominal emergencies. Meckel's diverticulum, despite its rarity as a lead point in this age group, must be considered to avoid delayed diagnosis and serious complications."

However, the rupture of a hepatic hydatid cyst into the abdominal cavity is a rare and potentially fatal complication. This complication is particularly complex in cirrhotic patients, posing significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. We present a case of a 64-year-old woman with a history of poorly managed post-viral cirrhosis due to hepatitis C who presented with abdominal pain lasting for ten days. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed the rupture of a hydatid cyst in the segment VIII of the liver, associated with a peritoneal reaction. An emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed, confirming the rupture and allowing for the resection of the protruding cyst dome, followed by peritoneal lavage and drainage. No recurrence was observed during a six-month follow-up. Hydatid disease is endemic in Tunisia and poses a significant public health concern. Although rare (1 to 16 %), intraperitoneal rupture is a severe complication. CT is a key diagnostic tool, offering high sensitivity, especially for differential diagnoses. The management of this condition necessitates urgent surgical intervention, followed by medical treatment with albendazole to prevent recurrence. This case underscores the rarity of intraperitoneal rupture of a hydatid cyst and emphasizes the importance of considering this complication in the diagnosis of abdominal emergencies in endemic regions, as delayed diagnosis is associated with a particularly poor prognosis."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis, a pediatric emergency, is usually managed with conventional three-port laparoscopic appendectomy (CTLA). Transumbilical laparoscopic-assisted appendectomy (TULAA) offers a novel approach, matching the benefits of CTLA. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of TULAA versus CTLA in children by incorporating newly reported outcomes (ileus, readmission), providing separate analyses for complicated and uncomplicated appendicitis, and updating existing evidence. A thorough search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases was made from inception to May 2024. Studies comparing the results of TULAA and conventional three-port laparoscopic appendectomy (CTLA) in pediatric patients aged 0 to 18 years were included. The mean differences for continuous and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes were combined using RevMan 5.4.1 software, with a 95% confidence interval using the random effects model. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool were used to ensure quality assessment. The funnel plots and Egger's regression test were used to assess the risk of publication bias in the included studies. This meta-analysis included 16 studies with 5084 pediatric patients. TULAA showed significantly shorter operative time (p = 0.00001), reduced hospital stay (p = 0.002), and lower intraabdominal infection rates (p = 0.03) compared to CTLA but required more additional ports (p = 0.00001). No significant differences were found in wound infection (p = 0.68), ileus (p = 0.38), conversion rate (p = 0.09), or readmission (p = 0.43). Separate analysis revealed shorter operative time with TULAA in both uncomplicated (p = 0.00001) and complicated cases (p = 0.002). Hospital stay was shorter only in uncomplicated cases (p = 0.01), while intraabdominal infections were lower in complicated cases (p = 0.01) in the TULAA group. Other outcomes remained comparable across both groups. TULAA was superior to CTLA in operative time, hospital stay, and intraabdominal infection. Separate analysis confirmed these benefits in uncomplicated cases and demonstrated reduced intraabdominal infections in complicated cases, though with higher conversion and port use. Remaining outcomes were similar. TULAA may be a safe and effective alternative to CTLA in selected pediatric cases, especially in complicated appendicitis. Prospero registration ID CRD42024563556.  https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42024563556 . • CTLA is the standard pediatric appendectomy procedure with established safety and efficacy. • TULAA is gaining popularity as a minimally invasive alternative, offering potential benefits. • The analysis highlights the efficacy of both TULAA and CTLA in overall appendicitis cases, while also offering a comparative assessment of their outcomes in complicated and uncomplicated appendicitis subgroups. • New insights into ileus and readmissions have not been previously addressed."

    "abstract": "Post-operative nutrition in emergency abdominal surgery can be challenging, and evidence on nutritional management in this population needs to be included in guidelines. This study aimed to describe the nutritional practice after emergency laparotomy at a university hospital and compare the routine practice to current guidelines. This was a single-centre retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients undergoing emergency laparotomy from August 2021 to August 2022. Patients transferred to other hospitals or non-surgical wards were excluded. Nutritional data during admission were assessed daily from post-operative day (POD) 1 up to POD 30. A total of 231 patients were included; 118 (51.1%) were male, and the median age was 71 years (IQR: 58-79 years). Bowel obstruction was found in 144 (62.3%) of patients. The median length of stay was eight days (IQR: 5-14 days). Any oral intake on POD 1 was achieved by 113 (48.9%), increasing to 203 (87.9%) on POD 5. Nasogastric tubes and dietary restrictions were standard in patients not achieving oral intake on POD 1. Parenteral nutrition was used in 66 (28.6%) patients; the median time from surgery to initiation of parenteral nutrition was four days (IQR: 3-6.75 days), and the median duration of parenteral nutrition was seven days (IQR: 5-15 days). Early oral intake after major emergency abdominal surgery was only achieved in half of the patients, and current practice deviates from current guidelines. Special considerations should be made in patients undergoing emergency laparotomy as their post-operative condition differs from that of elective cases. This study was supported by the Novo Nordisk Foundation (grant number NNF22OC0079459). The Novo Nordisk Foundation was not involved in study design, data collection, analysis, interpretation or writing. Not relevant."

    "abstract": "Peptic ulcer perforation (PUP) is a surgical emergency and life-threatening complication affecting 2-10% of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) patients. Delayed diagnosis and surgical management are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This study assessed the magnitude and outcome of PUP among patients operated on at two public hospitals in Jigjig town, Ethiopia. A 3-year hospital-based retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 130 patients operated for PUP at the study hospitals in Jigjig from April 1st, 2018, to July 30th, 2021. Data were collected from medical records. Bivariate analysis identified key factors impacting outcomes in PUP patients. The cohort had a male-to-female ratio of 8.7:1, and a mean age of 38 ± 13.3 years, with 48.8% smokers and 56.6% chat chewers. Duodenal perforations accounted for 93.7% of cases, with post-operative complications in 29.1% and an in-hospital mortality rate of 5.5%. Significant predictors of morbidity and mortality included advanced age (AOR 23.88), comorbidities (AOR 26.80), pre-operative hypotension (AOR 32.33), and delayed hospital presentation (AOR 30.10). Male predominance, younger age, high smoking and chat chewing rates, and primarily duodenal perforations are common in perforated peptic ulcer cases. Advanced age, comorbidities, pre-operative hypotension, and delayed hospital presentation significantly increase postoperative complications and mortality, emphasizing the need for timely intervention and targeted public health measures to improve patient outcomes. Early intervention and careful management of comorbidities are crucial to improve survival and reduce complications in patients with PUP."

    "abstract": "Current evidence indicates that for patients requiring renal replacement therapy, USPD may correlate with reduced complications and lower mortality rates compared to USHD. However, there is a lack of literature specifically addressing its application and results in individuals with ESRD. A comprehensive examination and synthesis of existing research were conducted to compare fellow-up outcomes of USPD versus USHD in ESRD patients. A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, and SpringerLink databases for that compare USPD to USHD before November 1, 2024. Mortality, all complications, noninfectious complications, infectious complications, bacteremia, and peritonitis were used as outcomes to compare USPD and USHD. This meta-analysis incorporated seven studies involving a total of 1,338 patients. Our findings showed no notable distinctions in peritonitis between USPD and USHD. urgent-start PD was linked to a reduced mortality rate \"(OR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.24-0.95, p < 0.05), lower all complications (OR: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.20-0.37, p < 0.05), lower noninfectious complications (OR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.23-0.45, p < 0.05), lower infectious complications (OR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.17-0.51, p < 0.05), lower bacteremia (OR: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.07-0.42, p < 0.05)\" compared to USHD. Our findings indicate that among patients with ESRD, those undergoing urgent-start PD have lower risks during the follow-up period compared to those receiving USHD. USPD is associated with significantly reduced all-cause mortality, overall complications, infectious complications, noninfectious complications, and bacteremia incidence. The results indicate that USPD could potentially function as an appropriate replacement for USHD. However, further high-quality clinical studies still are necessary to substantiate this conclusion."

    "abstract": "Garré stricture is a very rare complication post-reduction of a strangulated hernia before gangrene, first described in 1892. Diagnosis poses difficulty without a proper history and information about the prior interventions. A 50-year-old lady with a groin swelling for two years, diagnosed with an obstructed femoral hernia, underwent trans-inguinal exploration under spinal anesthesia and discharged on the 4th post-operative day after an uneventful postoperative period. The patient again presented on the 21st post-operative day with features of intestinal obstruction and underwent emergency laparotomy on the 3rd day of second admission for complete bowel obstruction. Intraoperative diagnosis was Garré stricture, and resection of the ileal stricture with ileo-ileal anastomosis was done and discharged on the 12th post-operative day without any complications, and further follow-up was uneventful. First noticed by Richter in 1782 and later described by Garré in 1892 after literature review. If blood supply is restored after manual or surgical reduction of bowel in a strangulated hernia, before the critical time of ischemia may lead to mucosal ulceration and sub-mucosal fibrosis, which can lead to fibrosis of the strangulated segment. These patients may present with features of intestinal obstruction caused by the stricture segment requiring surgical intervention. Among complications of groin hernia, Garré stricture is rarely encountered. It can be cause of intestinal obstruction, especially in post-reduction cases of groin hernia. So, knowledge about this rare complication is very beneficial in the management of strangulated hernia and its future complications."

    "abstract": "Introduction Bowel perforation is a common emergency with high morbidity and mortality. The patient presented with acute abdomen, abdominal distention, obstipation, and frequent gas under the diaphragm on radiogram. Arterial blood gas (ABG) is one of the earliest investigations done in cases of suspected bowel perforation in the Emergency Room (ER), and includes serum lactate.  Objective This study evaluates the role of sequential monitoring of serum lactate levels while ensuring a consistent timing of measurements and finding associations with prolonged hospital stay, surgical site occurrence, anastomotic leak, and mortality outcomes. Methods The study included 72 patients who presented to the healthcare facility within 72 hours of the onset of symptoms or occurrence. Continuous ABG was done before surgery and at POD 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7, and various parameters like age, sex, comorbidities, duration of presentation, site of perforation, prolonged hospital stay, surgical site occurrence, anastomotic leak, and mortality were noted in the form of tables. Results Analysis revealed that the mean serum lactate levels were generally higher in patients with prolonged hospital stays as compared to those without; however, there was no statistical significance at any time point. For surgical site occurrences (SSOs), there was no statistically significant difference in lactate levels between the two groups at Pre-Op, POD1, and POD2; however, significant differences were observed since POD3. For anastomotic leak, significant differences were observed at POD2. And for mortality, preoperatively, the mean lactate level in the mortality group was 5.91 mmol/L and 2.74 mmol/L in the non-mortality group, and this was statistically significant in all time periods. Conclusion Elevated serum lactate levels were consistently associated with adverse postoperative outcomes, including prolonged hospital stay, SSOs, anastomotic leaks, and mortality, with significance observed particularly from POD2 onward. Although not all differences were statistically significant, the trends suggest a meaningful clinical correlation. Routine lactate monitoring may serve as an important tool for the early detection of complications and risk stratification."

    "abstract": "Strangulated inguinal hernias are a common surgical emergency that requires prompt intervention to save the bowel. Perforation of the strangulated bowel loop inside the inguinal canal due to delayed presentation is known, but the occurrence of intraperitoneal proximal bowel perforation is exceedingly rare. This poses a unique challenge in terms of the surgical incision required and the type of hernia repair to be done. This case report describes a 44-year-old male who presented with a strangulated right inguinal hernia along with peritonitis. A midline exploratory laparotomy revealed two perforations in the proximal ileum, which were sutured primarily. The entire bowel was checked for any obvious gross pathology. The bowel wall did not appear inflamed, thickened, or constricted at any point. The strangulated bowel in the inguinal canal was viable and was reduced successfully, and the hernia was repaired through a separate inguinal incision using the nylon Darning technique. The patient had a full recovery with no recurrence at six-month follow-up."

    "abstract": "Internal hernias often present with vague and nonspecific symptoms of bowel obstruction. However, they carry a potential for bowel ischemia; as such, they need immediate surgery. It is important to identify the etiology of small bowel obstruction as it may cause ischemia or strangulation of the bowel. Most guidelines suggest a wait-and-watch policy for small bowel obstruction. At the same time, if there are any signs of peritonitis, strangulation, or bowel ischemia, surgical exploration is recommended. We present a case of an 81-year-old man who came to the emergency department with complaints of vague but persistent abdominal pain. The pain was localized to the right flank and had become dull in nature. An abdominal X-ray showed a few air-fluid levels suggestive of subacute obstruction. The portable ultrasound was inconclusive. A non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) scan of the abdomen was done for the non-resolution of pain. It revealed rotation/volvulus in the small bowel mesentery. A deeper look suggested the possibility of internal transmesenteric herniation with evidence of early bowel ischemia. Surgical exploration revealed ileal loops internally herniating inside a band of mesenteric tissue. The mesenteric band was cut, and the obstruction was relieved. Subsequently, the patient was discharged home."

    "abstract": "Foreign body ingestion is a common gastrointestinal emergency, particularly in children, who account for 80% of cases. While most ingested objects pass spontaneously, around 20% require medical intervention. In adults, incidents often occur accidentally during meals, leading to impactions, especially in individuals with underlying esophageal conditions. Endoscopy remains the gold standard for foreign body retrieval, with a success rate exceeding 95%. The type, shape, and location of the foreign body determine the clinical presentation and management approach. Sharp objects, batteries, and large items pose the highest risk of complications, including perforation, obstruction, and chemical injury. Prompt endoscopic removal is guided by established protocols, with emergent intervention required for complete esophageal obstruction and high-risk objects. Various retrieval devices, including forceps, snares, baskets, and overtubes, are used based on the nature of the foreign body. Technological advancements, such as artificial intelligence-assisted imaging and endoscopic ultrasound, are improving diagnostic precision and procedural outcomes. Despite these advances, foreign body ingestion can still lead to severe complications if not managed in a timely manner. Public awareness, preventive measures, and rapid medical response are essential in reducing morbidity and mortality associated with foreign body ingestion."

    "abstract": "Stercoral colitis (SC) can potentially lead to bowel ischemia, sepsis, and perforation. While physicians have increasingly recognized the clinical importance of this condition, the risk of progression in patients with uncomplicated SC who do not have indications for emergency surgery remains unclear. The aim of this study was to determine prognostic factors associated with treatment failure in patients with uncomplicated SC in an emergency care setting. We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a tertiary care hospital from April 2013 to March 2023. We included patients aged 18 years or older who were diagnosed with uncomplicated SC based on computed tomography (CT) at the emergency department. We analyzed the following prognostic factors: age, frailty, rebound tenderness, serum amylase level, and D-dimer level. We also analyzed the following CT findings: location of impacted fecaloma, maximum axial diameter and thickening of the affected colon, and the presence of pneumatosis coli and free fluid. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as the need for conversion from conservative treatment to emergency surgery or progression to in-hospital death. We used univariate logistic regression analysis to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Of the 117 patients identified, 15 patients (13%) had treatment failure. The presence of rebound tenderness (crude OR 57, 95% CI 10-330) and CT findings of pneumatosis coli (crude OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.5-14) and free fluid (crude OR 6.5, 95% CI 2.0-21) were associated with treatment failure. Frailty and results of blood examinations were not associated with poor outcomes. A substantial number of patients with uncomplicated SC progressed to requiring emergency surgery or died. Physical signs of peritonitis and specific CT findings may aid in the identification of high-risk patients who require closer monitoring and potential surgical intervention."

    "abstract": "Subhepatic appendicitis is an uncommon anatomical variant of acute appendicitis, with a documented incidence of approximately 0.08 %. It poses notable diagnostic challenges due to its atypical symptomatology. In resource-constrained setting, delayed diagnosis is common due to limited access to advanced imaging techniques, thereby requiring a clinical judgement. We describe the case of a 33-year-old male presenting with acute abdominal pain that initially originated in the periumbilical region and subsequently localized to the right upper quadrant, accompanied by episodes of vomiting. Initial ultrasonographic (USG) evaluation was inconclusive; however, a focused repeat USG revealed a non-compressible, inflamed tubular structure in the subhepatic region. Based on clinical findings, a diagnosis of subhepatic appendicitis was established. The patient underwent emergency open appendectomy via a gridiron incision. Intraoperative findings confirmed an inflamed appendix located in the subhepatic space. Due to its unusual anatomical position and non-specific clinical features, subhepatic appendicitis is frequently misdiagnosed. Diagnostic imaging, particularly USG and computed tomography (CT), plays an essential role; however, CT availability may be limited in under-resourced settings. In such cases, diagnostic can be made through the use of clinical scoring systems, high degree of suspicion in combination with targeted USG. Open appendectomy is a dependable surgical approach, especially when laparoscopic facilities are unavailable. Subhepatic appendicitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of right upper quadrant abdominal pain suggestive of appendicitis, especially when the appendix is not visualized using standard imaging techniques. Prompt clinical judgement and timely surgical intervention are vital to minimizing complications and ensuring favorable patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "While societal guidelines help direct management of diverticulitis and diverticular bleeding broadly, our review focuses on the latest data for nuanced care of older patients affected by these conditions. Diverticulitis in older patients can present with non-specific symptoms so a broad work up is recommended. Once diagnosed, those with uncomplicated disease (Hinchey Class 0 or 1a) can be safely managed without antibiotics or admission depending on frailty and comorbidities. Most older patients with complicated diverticulitis (abscess, perforation or obstruction) should be hospitalized. Elective or emergent surgery for complicated disease (Hinchey Class 1b-4) is associated with higher morbidity and mortality, particularly in older patients. The risk of diverticular bleeding and re-bleeding significantly increases with age, potentially due to the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and anticoagulants. Diverticular disease and its associated complications disproportionately affect older adults. Management should focus on resuscitation, having low threshold for comprehensive work up and re-evaluating medication use for comorbid conditions to prevent recurrence."

We report two cases of GPA/MPA complicated by GI bleeding and perforation, both requiring emergency surgical intervention. The first case involved a man in his 30s with GPA who developed massive small bowel bleeding following treatment with high-dose corticosteroids and rituximab. The second case involved an elderly man with MPA, complicated by Clostridioides difficile enteritis and subsequent colonic perforation. These cases suggest that not only primary vasculitic vascular injury but also secondary factors, such as immunosuppressive therapy and opportunistic infections like Clostridioides  difficile, may synergistically contribute to the development of severe GI complications. Surgical strategies must be carefully tailored based on disease activity, overall clinical condition, and corticosteroid exposure, with an emphasis on balancing the risks of rebleeding, infection, and healing failure in the context of systemic vasculitis. Emerging therapies such as avacopan may help mitigate the risk of GI complications. Early recognition and multidisciplinary management are essential to improving outcomes in patients with GI involvement in GPA/MPA."

    "abstract": "The majority of ingested foreign bodies are uneventfully expelled through the gastrointestinal tract. However, anatomically narrowed areas in the proximal gastrointestinal tract create sites of increased retention/impaction of ingested foreign bodies. Foreign body impaction in the esophagus poses a medical emergency because of the complications associated with delayed management: esophageal perforation, infection, and fistula formation. Thus, urgent endoscopic intervention to remove sharp esophageal foreign bodies is necessary. A 45-year-old male presented with a 3-day history of a foreign body in the esophagus. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy identified a horizontally lodged V-shaped fishbone with both lateral edges deeply embedded in the esophageal mucosa. When endoscopic removal using traditional removal accessories failed, endoscopic scissors were used to fracture the spinous process edge of the fishbone, and the fishbone was advanced into the gastric lumen. A makeshift endoscope hood was fashioned from a sterile glove, attached to the distal end of the endoscope, and used to remove the fishbone. The off-label use of endoscopic scissors to relieve the proximal esophageal obstruction by fracturing the fishbone was integral in achieving successful removal."

It often results from congenital defects caused by errors during intestinal rotation and fixation during embryonic development. These hernias can present as nonspecific abdominal pain or acute intestinal obstruction, making diagnosis challenging. In this case report, a young man, in his early 30s, presented with acute upper abdominal pain, obstipation and distension. Initial radiological investigations were inconclusive, prompting a contrast-enhanced CT scan, which revealed a left paraduodenal hernia with encapsulated jejunal loops. Emergency laparotomy confirmed the diagnosis, and the hernia was repaired by reducing the bowel loops, excising the hernial sac and closing the defect. Paraduodenal hernias carry a high risk of complications such as strangulation, bowel necrosis and perforation, making early diagnosis and surgical intervention crucial. This case highlights the importance of considering internal hernias in patients with unexplained recurrent abdominal pain, particularly in the absence of previous surgeries."

In this retrospective study, we reviewed consecutive patients with WON treated endoscopically at a tertiary referral center during a 10-year period to identify cases who required abdominal emergency surgery. A total of 271 patients with WON were included, of whom 24 (9%) developed abdominal complications requiring surgical intervention. Eight patients underwent surgery before endoscopic intervention and 16 (66%) after. The most prevalent complication was intestinal ischemia in 11 cases (46%), bleeding in 4 cases (17%), intestinal perforation in 3 cases (13%), bowel stenosis in 3 cases (13%), and fistula in 3 cases (13%). The mortality during admission did not differ significantly between patients requiring surgery and patients who did not (20.8% vs 13.8%, P = 0.392). This study demonstrates that complications requiring abdominal surgery in patients undergoing endoscopic treatment for WON occur in one of 10 patients, intestinal ischemia being the most frequent cause of intervention."

Despite successful revascularization, ongoing organ damage can persist from ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and there is a need for adjunct therapies to ameliorate this ongoing insult. Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 36) were divided into five groups: control, heparin (HEP), HEP + verapamil (VER), HEP + valproic acid (VPA), HEP+VER+VPA. The animals were subjected to 45 min of superior mesenteric artery occlusion followed by 4 h of reperfusion. Upon reperfusion, therapies were administered. Plasma samples were collected before occlusion and at end-of-study for intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The full length of the small intestine was collected, stained with H&E and scored according to the Park/Chiu score for intestinal ischemia damage. Twenty-three of 36 rats survived 4 h of reperfusion and there was no difference in survival between the groups. I-FABP levels was significantly lower in HEP+VER vs. control (3.8 ± 1.5 vs. 6.18 ± 1.0ng/ml; p = 0.0040). IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha showed the lowest mean values in the HEP+VER group compared to all groups. The histological analysis revealed the lowest score of intestinal damage in the HEP+VER group, however, the difference to control was not significant. Administering heparin and verapamil at the time of revascularization may mitigate intestinal IRI without causing detrimental systemic effects. Further studies in large animal models and in the setting of local administration are needed to investigate the potential of this approach."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common abdominal surgical emergency and is a major cause of acute abdomen in more than 20% of cases. Although various studies have been conducted in recent years on topics such as surgical techniques and antibiotic treatment of appendicitis, today there is a lack of large-scale studies focused on the different severity levels of acute appendicitis and their management. The study aimed to analyze the severity, types of surgical techniques, and mortality associated with acute appendicitis to identify possible developments. We conducted a retrospective multicenter observational study based on routine data from 2010 to 2022. Patients over 18 years old with acute appendicitis were included and the following data were collected: patient demographics, comorbidities, type of surgery, complications, admission to ICU, length of stay, and in-hospital mortality. A total of 31,988 patients were included in the study. At the end of the study, 97.0% (P < .001) of the patients underwent laparoscopic appendectomy, with 86% of cases involving closure of the appendix stump by stapler (P < .001). It was only from 2014 onwards that more than 90% of surgeries were performed laparoscopically, and from 2017, this figure rose to 95%. Complicated appendicitis was present in 27.4% of cases. The distribution of severity was as follows: unspecified acute appendicitis in 39.5%, appendicitis with local peritonitis in 33.1%, appendicitis with local peritonitis and perforation in 17.1%, appendicitis with peritoneal abscess in 5.4%, and appendicitis with generalized peritonitis in 4.9%. Women had a significantly lower risk for conversion to an open operation than men (P < .001). The highest morbidity was observed in the group that converted from laparoscopy to open surgery (P <.001). Non-surgical treatment of appendicitis was not relevant, accounting for only 4% of cases. Since 2017, primary laparoscopic appendectomy has been the gold standard for even complicated acute appendicitis (> 95% annually). Over three-quarters of patients undergo an appendectomy with a stapler, making this surgical technique the preferred method of laparoscopic surgery in Germany. Patients who undergo an interoperative switch to open therapy should be considered a subgroup at risk of increased mortality. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT06558760."

    "abstract": "Gastric volvulus is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition that can arise as a complication of a giant hiatal hernia. It results from an abnormal rotation of the stomach, which can lead to obstruction, ischemia, or even gastric necrosis. Prompt recognition and surgical intervention are essential to prevent serious outcomes. We present the case of a 58-year-old female patient with a history of hypertension who arrived at the emergency department with acute-onset severe epigastric pain (10/10 on the Visual Analog Scale), accompanied by nausea but no vomiting. Physical examination revealed involuntary guarding in the epigastric region. Initial imaging with contrast-enhanced esophagogram showed a giant hiatal hernia with intrathoracic migration of the stomach and signs of gastric volvulus. A subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the herniation of the gastric antrum through the esophageal hiatus with organoaxial rotation. The patient underwent urgent laparoscopic surgery. Intraoperatively, the stomach was found to be viable, with no evidence of necrosis or perforation. The herniated stomach was reduced, and the esophageal hiatus was dissected and repaired using a prosthetic mesh. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged on the second postoperative day. She remains asymptomatic at follow-up. This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis and intervention in patients with acute gastric volvulus, especially when associated with a giant hiatal hernia. Laparoscopic repair remains the gold standard, offering reduced morbidity, faster recovery, and favorable long-term outcomes. A literature review confirms that surgical correction of the anatomical defect is essential to prevent recurrence and severe complications such as ischemia or gastric necrosis. Endoscopic and percutaneous decompression may serve as temporary measures but are not substitutes for definitive surgical treatment."

    "abstract": "Duodenal perforation poses a significant global health challenge, contributing substantially to morbidity, mortality, and hospitalizations. While most perforations occur in the first part of the duodenum, are typically small, and affect older individuals, giant perforations in the second part of the duodenum are exceedingly rare. A 20-year-old male patient presented with a three-day history of diffuse abdominal pain, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and anorexia of similar duration. The physical examination revealed PR = 104, BP = 110/70 mmHg and diffuse abdominal tenderness. A significant intraoperative finding was a 5 × 6 cm perforation in the second portion of the duodenum, with leakage of gastrointestinal and biliary contents consistent with biliary peritonitis. A pyloric exclusion, retrocolic gastrojejunostomy, and duodenal repair were performed. Perforations in the second part of the duodenum are considerably rarer. However, when perforation does occur, particularly in the second part of the duodenum, management presents significant challenges, often associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Our patient presented with one the high-risk factors-delayed presentation-and, based on established risk stratification models, would therefore carry an estimated mortality risk of approximately 10 %. There is currently a paucity of definitive guidelines or strong expert consensus regarding the optimal surgical approach for giant duodenal perforations located in the second part. In our patient's case, we performed a repair of the perforation, pyloric exclusion, and retrocolic gastrojejunostomy. Perforation of the second part of the duodenum is a rare occurrence and presents significant management challenges in emergency situations."

A detailed clinical examination, imaging, and comprehensive systemic workup were performed to determine the etiology. The case was managed surgically and followed postoperatively at a tertiary hospital within the Spanish National Health System. We report the case of a 66-year-old woman receiving tralokinumab for atopic dermatitis who presented with a spontaneous 10 mm peripheral corneal perforation, self-sealed by iris prolapse. Urgent surgical intervention included corneal suturing and amniotic membrane grafting. There was no evidence of trauma, infection, systemic autoimmune disease, or periocular atopic dermatitis. A comprehensive systemic workup ruled out infectious and autoimmune etiologies. Tralokinumab was discontinued in coordination with the dermatology department. The patient experienced a favorable recovery, with complete corneal healing and improvement in best-corrected visual acuity to 0.1 logMAR at 3 months. This case represents the first reported instance of corneal perforation potentially related to tralokinumab. Although ocular side effects of IL-13-targeted therapies are typically mild, this report highlights the possibility of severe complications. Given the increasing use of biologic agents in dermatology, awareness of rare but potentially vision-threatening adverse effects is essential. In suspected cases, early ophthalmologic evaluation and multidisciplinary management are crucial for preventing poor outcomes in patients receiving tralokinumab."

The case of an 82-year-old woman with a history of pelvic radiotherapy for cervical cancer that developed intra-abdominal free air after urinary catheterization is reported. The patient exhibited only mild abdominal tenderness, and computed tomography showed intra-abdominal free air. Emergency laparotomy was performed based on the radiological findings, showing intraperitoneal bladder rupture with the catheter extruded through the bladder wall. Retrospective analysis suggested that the combination of radiation-induced bladder wall fragility and mechanical irritation by the catheter contributed to the rupture. Clinicians should recognize that intra-abdominal free air is not always indicative of gastrointestinal perforation. Bladder rupture should be considered, particularly following radiation therapy in lower abdominal cancer patients. Detailed history taking and physical examination can help prevent misdiagnosis and unnecessary surgical intervention in cases with mild abdominal symptoms."

    "abstract": "Motorcycle accidents often result in abdominal trauma in patients seeking emergency care. Injuries to the hollow viscera, including the duodenum, jejunum, urinary bladder, and colorectum, are relatively common. In contrast, owing to the protective function of the anterior rib cage, gastric rupture is exceptionally rare, with an incidence of < 1.7%. Gastric rupture typically occurs in the anterior wall and rarely presents as multiple ruptures. This report describes an unusual case of multiple gastric ruptures resulting from blunt trauma. A 21-year-old man, who was involved in a motorcycle collision at 70 km/hour after consuming a large meal, presented with hypotension. Physical examination revealed abdominal tenderness. Laboratory test results indicated elevated amylase, lipase, and liver enzyme levels. Computed tomography showed pneumoperitoneum, hemoperitoneum, and gastric wall discontinuation, suggesting gastric perforation alongside pancreatic, splenic, and hepatic injuries. Angiographic embolization was performed because of active contrast leakage in the left gastric and right gastroepiploic arteries. Emergency laparotomy revealed substantial blood loss, hematoma, and gastric contents scattered throughout the abdominal cavity. Two 10 cm gastric perforations in the anterior and posterior walls were identified, as well as severe liver damage, splenic injury, and pancreatic contusion. Surgical interventions included primary closure of the gastric wall, splenectomy, and partial hepatectomy. After temporary abdominal closure, the patient underwent a second surgery without further bleeding. The gastric repair site was resected and reinforced for optimal tissue healing. Gastric rupture following blunt trauma is fatal. However, patients without severe complications can recover through surgical interventions and postoperative care."

    "abstract": "Pneumorachis, defined as air within the spinal canal, is a rare radiological finding, typically associated with trauma or iatrogenic causes. Its spontaneous occurrence following vomiting raises important diagnostic concerns, notably the possibility of esophageal perforation or barotrauma via the Macklin effect. We report a case of a 37-year-old man with a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and chronic alcohol use, found collapsed at home after a possible 48-hour period on the floor. Shortly after initial mobilization by emergency responders, he developed sudden cardiac arrest, with return of spontaneous circulation achieved within two minutes. Following transport and hospital admission, he remained hypotensive and required ICU admission with mechanical ventilation. A whole-body CT scan, performed during the transfer from the emergency department to the intensive care unit, revealed extensive pneumorachis from the cervical to thoracic spine and associated pneumomediastinum without pneumothorax or free fluid. Neurological evaluation was initially not feasible due to sedation. Collateral history revealed repeated episodes of forceful vomiting prior to presentation. Upper endoscopy showed no obvious esophageal rupture. After sedation was weaned, neurological examination showed no focal deficits. A transient vertical nystagmus, likely due to thiamine deficiency in the context of previous gastric surgery and alcohol misuse, resolved with supplementation. The patient recovered fully under conservative management, with follow-up imaging showing complete resolution. The findings were consistent with barotrauma-induced air dissection, most likely via the Macklin effect. However, a self-contained esophageal microperforation could not be completely ruled out. This case highlights the importance of structured evaluation and clinical restraint in the presence of dramatic imaging findings. Spontaneous pneumorachis, though alarming on imaging, may follow a benign course once life-threatening causes have been excluded. Awareness of its rarity and potential diagnostic pitfalls is key to avoiding unnecessary invasive interventions."

    "abstract": "A 74-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a 5-day history of abdominal pain and fever. Laboratory tests suggested infection and biliary obstruction. Contrast photon-counting computed tomography (PCCT) imaging revealed gallstones, acute cholecystitis, gallbladder perforation, and dilation of the upper segment of the common bile duct, with a suspicion of a potential common bile duct stone (CBDS) that was not visualized. When the energy level was adjusted to 120 keV during postprocessing, a tiny, high-density nodule in the common bile duct became visible. It was further enhanced using a pseudo-colored gallstone template. Surgical exploration confirmed the presence of CBDS. CBDS is often associated with complications such as biliary obstruction, cholangitis, and pancreatitis. In this case, identifying a tiny CBDS after initial contrast imaging suggested that CBDS may have been the underlying cause of the gallbladder perforation. PCCT's multi-energy capabilities played a crucial role in improving diagnostic accuracy and provided clinical insights into the possible cause of the perforation. This case demonstrates the importance of PCCT in diagnosing tiny CBDS, which may change the clinical understanding of gallbladder perforation etiology."

    "abstract": "Vault dehiscence is a rare but significant complication of hysterectomy that can result in bowel evisceration through the vagina. This condition occurs when there is separation of the surgically created vaginal cuff, which can lead to serious morbidity, including bowel evisceration, ischaemia, and peritonitis. Vault dehiscence usually occurs in the months following a hysterectomy, but there have been a few case reports of late vaginal vault dehiscence. This report explores the case of a 48-year-old multiparous menopausal woman who presented to the emergency department with unprovoked vaginal cuff dehiscence, on a background of open hysterectomy two years prior. The patient had undergone a laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair two weeks prior to her presentation at the emergency department with dehiscence, raising the question of whether that laparoscopic procedure was related to the presentation with vault dehiscence because it had resulted in weakness of the vaginal vault. She underwent emergency laparoscopic surgery to examine the eviscerated bowel and repair the vault defect. This case report outlines the risk factors for vault dehiscence and factors which may be associated with late and unusual presentations of vault dehiscence after hysterectomy."

This case involves a 71-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with complete large bowel obstruction secondary to a sigmoid mass, raising concern for malignancy. Initial plans were made for decompression and colonoscopy. However, the patient left the hospital against medical advice and subsequently returned two days later with massive abdominal distension and peritonitis. Emergent exploratory celiotomy revealed a septic abdomen with gross contamination due to perforation in the ascending colon near the hepatic flexure, which was not amenable to repair. At a minimum, a subtotal colectomy was required. The patient underwent a single-stage oncologic subtotal colectomy with a hand-sewn ileosigmoid anastomosis and fascial closure. Pathologic evaluation confirmed stage IIb invasive sigmoid adenocarcinoma with negative margins and 0/43 lymph nodes. The patient was discharged on postoperative day nine without complications. For patients presenting with abdominal sepsis from fecal contamination caused by large bowel perforation due to sigmoid malignancy and obstruction, surgical management options vary widely. These range from damage control surgery with multiple subsequent procedures to single-stage resection and anastomosis. This case underscores the importance of individualized, careful decision-making both preoperatively and intraoperatively. It highlights the factors to consider when evaluating the feasibility of single-stage oncologic surgery and the risks associated with performing a primary anastomosis during emergent operations."

An exploratory laparotomy was performed, with the finding of a true ileo-ileal knot with ischemic bowel compromise. The etiology of ileo-ileal knotting is not well described, and it has not been linked to a specific age or sex. The surgical approach could vary between untying the knot if the affected loop is still viable or performing a resection en bloc with anastomosis if there are signs of necrosis or gangrene. Intestinal knotting is a diagnostic challenge usually confirmed at the time of the surgery. Surgeons must be aware of ileo-ileal knotting as a differential diagnosis for acute abdomen in order to operate on time, know when a resection is needed, and the right technique to perform in these cases."

    "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the clinical characteristics, treatment and prognosis of juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) complicated by sever gastrointestinal hemorrhage in children. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 4 JDM patients with sever gastrointestinal hemorrhage admitted to our hospital, from January 2017 to January 2025. Data including demographics, clinical manifestations, laboratory and imaging findings, treatment courses, and outcomes were reviewed. Results: The cohort comprised 4 patients (2 males, 2 females), with onset ages of 6.1, 6.2, 10.0 and 8.0 years. All presented with rash and fatigue and were diagnosed with severe refractory JDM (strongly positive anti-NXP2 antibodies). Sever gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred 18, 12, 51, and 2 months after JDM diagnosis. Two cases had confirmed gastrointestinal infections due to contaminated food. Abdominal pain was the initial gastrointestinal symptom and black stool was observed in all cases, hemoglobin levels dropped below 60 g/L (case 1-4 decreased to 38, 59, 60 and 43 g/L respectively). All patients exhibited intestinal wall thickening. Active bleeding sites included the duodenum (3 cases: 2 cases near the duodenal papilla, 1 cases with diffuse duodenal oozing). Emergency endoscopic hemostasis was performed in 3 cases. One patient with diffuse duodenal bleeding required additional glucocortieoid pulse therapy after failed interventional embolization. Three patients stabilized following aggressive treatment of JDM, while 1 case died due to duodenal perforation. Conclusions: Anti-NXP2 antibody-positive JDM patients are prone to gastrointestinal involvement, particularly in chronic cases. Duodenal bleeding is common, with vascular erosion and deep mucosal ulcers posing life-threatening risks. For children with positive anti-NXP2 antibodies who present with abdominal pain and thickened intestinal walls, early endoscopic examination should be conducted as soon as possible to detect digestive tract lesions and provide timely treatment. Patients with severe digestive tract bleeding usually require active treatment for the underlying disease combined with endoscopic hemostasis therapy. Under timely treatment, the prognosis is relatively favorable. 目的： 探讨幼年皮肌炎（JDM）合并消化道大出血患儿的临床特点、治疗与预后情况。 方法： 回顾性病例总结。分析2017年1月至2025年1月首都医科大学附属首都儿童医学中心收治的4例JDM合并消化道大出血患儿的一般情况、临床表现、实验室检查、影像学检查、诊疗经过及预后情况等资料。 结果： 4例患儿中男2例、女2例，起病年龄分别为6.1、6.2、10.0及8.0岁，均以皮疹伴乏力为主诉就诊，均为重度难治性JDM，肌炎特异性抗体均为抗核基质蛋白2（NXP2）抗体强阳性，JDM确诊后18、12、51及2个月发生消化道大出血，2例患儿有明确不洁饮食致消化道感染，1例患儿出血前1 d曾进食大量难以消化食物，胃肠道受累的首发症状均为腹痛，病程中均有黑便，血红蛋白均降至60 g/L以下（例1~4分别降至38、59、60、43 g/L）。4例患儿均有肠壁增厚，3例出血部位为十二指肠活动性出血，其中2例为十二指肠乳头旁、1例为十二指肠降部弥漫性渗血，3例均经过急诊胃镜下止血，1例弥漫性十二指肠出血经介入栓塞治疗无效后胃镜下肾上腺素喷洒及激素冲击治疗后好转。3例患儿积极治疗原发病后病情平稳，1例十二指肠穿孔抢救无效死亡。 结论： 抗NXP2抗体阳性JDM易合并消化道受累，出血部位多为十二指肠，当出现腹痛、肠壁增厚情况应尽早消化内镜检查，以早期发现并及时治疗。合并消化道大出血患儿多需积极治疗原发病结合内镜下止血治疗，及时治疗情况下预后相对良好。."

Data from an exhaustive literature search conducted across Embase (Ovid), Medline(R) ALL (Ovid), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was summarized. Literature published between January 2013 and December 2024 was included. Most studies found better outcomes for the no-drain group. Implementing a drain after EGS procedures potentially increases hospital stays, postoperative pain, and surgical site infection rates. For conditions such as peritonitis and perforated ulcers, only a few studies were available, with some showing benefits of PD. For some conditions, like colorectal emergencies, there is a scarcity of evidence. The outcomes suggest that PD is not recommended in most EGS cases. In high-risk cases, there are some reports on improved outcomes for PD use. Further research is imperative to create science-based clinical guidelines, especially for less-researched conditions."

Although hydatid cyst perforation is rare, it necessitates urgent surgical intervention to prevent severe complications such as anaphylaxis, bile leakage, and secondary infection. This retrospective study analyzed 13 patients with hydatid cyst perforation who were treated in a general surgery clinic between 2017 and 2022. Data regarding clinical presentation, diagnostic methods, surgical approaches, postoperative outcomes, and follow-up were reviewed. All patients underwent emergency surgery involving cyst evacuation, peritoneal lavage with scolicidal agents, and postoperative albendazole therapy. The cohort included eight male and five female patients, with a mean age of 33 years. Spontaneous perforation occurred in 12 cases, and one case was due to trauma. The liver was the most commonly affected organ (92.3%). Surgical interventions consisted of partial cystectomy with omentopexy in 12 patients. The recurrence rate was 8%. Postoperative complications were minimal, including two bile fistulas that resolved spontaneously and one case of wound infection. The average hospital stay was 9.2 days, and the mean follow-up duration was 18.8 months. One patient with cirrhosis died due to complications from portal hypertension. Hydatid cyst rupture is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition, particularly in endemic regions. Prompt surgical intervention, combined with postoperative albendazole therapy, is essential to reduce morbidity, mortality, and recurrence. Lifelong monitoring is recommended for patients with intraperitoneal perforations to manage potential complications of hydatidosis."

    "abstract": "Intestinal endometriosis is a rare condition that can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. It occurs in approximately 5%-15% of women with endometriosis. Although it rarely leads to obstruction or perforation, there is no clear consensus on its optimal management. Hormonal therapy is considered the first-line treatment for endometriosis; however, the best approach for intestinal involvement remains controversial. This study aims to contribute to the literature by evaluating patients with intestinal endometriosis who underwent surgery for acute abdomen. Sixteen patients who underwent emergency surgery for acute abdomen at the Emergency General Surgery Clinic of İstanbul University-Cerrahpaşa, Cerrahpaşa Medical Faculty of Medicine, between February 2016 and April 2023 were identified. Four patients voluntarily withdrew from the study, and 12 were included in the analysis. Demographic data, laboratory findings, surgical records, length of hospital stay, pathology reports, postoperative complications within the first 30 days, and their management were reviewed. Patients' current health status was assessed through telephone interviews. The mean age of the patients was 39.3+-9.2 years. Nine patients underwent surgery with a preoperative diagnosis of intestinal obstruction, while three were operated on for suspected acute appendicitis. Among the patients with intestinal obstruction, three underwent laparoscopic ileocecal resection, and three had segmental small bowel resection. One patient underwent anterior resection with appendectomy, and another underwent both anterior resection and ileocecal resection with ileocolostomy. One patient underwent a left hemicolectomy. The mean hospital stay was 7.9+-5.9 days. Postoperative complications occurred in three patients (25%). The mean age of patients who experienced complications was significantly higher than that of those who did not (p<0.007). Histopathological examination revealed benign full-thickness endometriosis in all cases. The mean follow-up period was 50.6 months, with no recurrences observed. Acute abdomen due to intestinal endometriosis-related obstruction is extremely rare. In reproductive-aged women presenting with acute abdomen, intestinal endometriosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis. In cases of clinical suspicion, intraoperative consultation with a gynecologist is recommended, and a multidisciplinary approach should be adopted to optimize treatment planning."

Although surgery via laparotomy or thoracotomy to repair the hernia with or without mesh reinforcement is the gold standard of treatment for BH, conversion to open surgery is performed to obtain a good surgical view and sufficient working space. Herein, we describe a rare case of BH with incarcerated distal transverse colon treated by hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS). A 74-year-old man visited the outpatient clinic with the chief complaints of anorexia and abdominal distension. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan showed incarcerated left diaphragmatic hernia, with the distal transverse colon trapped in the left hemithorax with ischemic change. The patient was diagnosed with large bowel obstruction because of BH. Thus, emergency laparoscopic surgery was performed. However, it was converted to HALS because the colon could not be easily pulled back to the abdominal cavity. The transverse colon was carefully removed without perforation. The surgical course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged 1 week after surgery. HALS can be used when laparoscopic surgery is difficult."

MTTs occur more frequently in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). MTTs are most commonly found in the extremities, head and neck, and trunk; however, no cases in the mesentery have been reported. In this report, we describe a case of primary MTT of the mesentery in a patient with NF1. A 29-year-old woman with NF1 visited a clinic for abdominal pain and was referred to our hospital for treatment of an abdominal tumor detected by CT. Contrast-enhanced CT showed a 20-cm irregular mass on the right side of the abdominal cavity. The mass was extensively bordered by the superior mesenteric vein (SMV), but there was no obvious distant metastasis. The patient was diagnosed with a mesenteric tumor with SMV invasion. An open biopsy was performed, and the histopathological diagnosis was MTT. The patient was discharged on the 11th day after surgery but returned to our hospital on the 17th day due to abdominal pain. The tumor had markedly enlarged on CT, and a semi-emergent tumor resection was performed. An enlarged mass was detected, but no peritoneal dissemination was observed. The tumor was in extensive contact with the SMV, but it could be dissected. A right hemicolectomy was performed, and the tumor was removed. Histopathological findings revealed a 26.5 × 17.5 × 9.5 cm tumor in the ileocolic mesentery. The dissected surface was negative for margins, with no exposed tumors. The histopathological diagnosis was MTT. Follow-up CT on postoperative day 14 revealed multiple peritoneal nodules. The patient was diagnosed with recurrent peritoneal dissemination and treated with two courses of doxorubicin and one course of pazopanib. However, she died 5 months postoperatively due to worsening peritonitis carcinomatosis. We present a case of primary MTT of the mesentery. Our findings suggest that biopsy may lead to peritoneal dissemination. In patients with suspected MTT, such as those with NF1, abdominal cavity biopsy should be avoided, and diagnostic treatment should prioritize surgical resection."

However, it's uncommon for both conditions to present together, especially in the same anatomical location. We report a rare case of a 64-year-old male who presented with sudden abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Examination revealed a painful, erythematous para-umbilical hernia. CT imaging showed an incisional hernia containing a perforated segment of sigmoid colon with diverticulitis. The patient underwent emergency surgery with sigmoid resection, primary anastomosis, and hernia repair. His recovery was smooth, and he was discharged in good condition."

    "abstract": "A female patient in her 30s with a history of sleeve gastrectomy and subsequent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass developed severe epigastric pain 72 hours after intragastric balloon placement. Imaging and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed gastric perforation due to misplacement into the gastric pouch remnant. Emergency laparoscopic intervention confirmed necrosis and chemical peritonitis, necessitating balloon removal, peritoneal lavage, drainage and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Despite initial management, she required a second surgical lavage and intensive care for supportive treatment. Six weeks postsurgery, imaging confirmed complete recovery, and the patient remained asymptomatic. This case underscores the life-threatening complications of gastric balloons in post-bariatric surgery patients, emphasising the importance of strict adherence to contraindication guidelines and early imaging for accurate diagnosis and management."

    "abstract": "A 57-year-old woman with a history of polytrauma due to a car accident in March 2023 presented to de Emergency Room one month after this episode with subocclusive symptoms. CT scan revealed a 10cm proximal ileum segment as the reason of the subocclusion. This segment presented wall thickening, vascular engorgement, and inflammatory changes in the surrounding fat. The patient was admitted to the Surgical Department for conservative treatment, and after several days with no amelioration, intravenous corticosteroids were initiated with clinical improvement, patient was discharged on oral corticosteroids and referred to the Gastroenterology Clinic with a suspicion of Crohn's disease. However, the patient suffered two more subocclusive episodes improving with corticosteroids. After multidisciplinary discussion infliximab was finally initiated for Crohn's disease. In the weeks after this no more visits to the Emergency Room happened, but the patient continued with chronic subocclusive symptoms and weight loss. Due to diagnostic doubts and infliximab failure, surgical resection was decided. In November 2023 a 15cm medium ileal stenosis was resected. The segment was affected with both acute and chronic inflammation, mucosal ulceration covered with granulation tissue, villous atrophy, haemorrhage in the lamina propria, and architectural distortion. Final diagnosis was post-traumatic ileal stenosis. Eighteen months later no signs of recurrence have been appreciated. Small bowel obstruction after blunt abdominal trauma is a rare complication that manifests one week to several months or years after the trauma. There are no specific findings, but a prior history of blunt abdominal trauma with no previous obstructive symptoms must raise suspicion on this entity. Ulcers, transmural inflammation, fibromusculosis, and neovascularity in the submucosa, as well as siderophages and foreign body reaction in the subserosa can be found in the histopathological examination. It has been hypothesized that it maybe secondary to an inflammatory response to a localized intestinal perforation, or injury to the mesentery (whether it is localized haemorrhage, a rent in the mesentery, thrombosis of the mesenteric vessels) that leads to intestinal stenosis due to ischemic changes. It may be related to a strong compression of the intestine and its mesentery between the seatbelt and the spinal column. Treatment for this condition is resecting the stenosis."

    "abstract": "An 85-year-old male presented to our emergency department with a three-day history of nausea, vomiting, diffuse lower abdominal pain, and diarrhea. His last bowel movement was in the morning prior to the evaluation. Physical exam demonstrated diffuse abdominal tenderness without peritoneal signs. CT scanning of the abdomen and pelvis (without contrast) was concerning for low-grade obstruction. He was observed for the next 24 hours. Although some improvement occurred, an elevated serum lactate and deteriorating renal function resulted in the decision to perform diagnostic laparoscopy to assess the presumed small bowel obstruction. Operative findings suggested the possibility of malrotation, so an open laparotomy was performed. This operation demonstrated the presence of Ladd's bands with torsion of the small bowel. The Ladd's bands were lysed, the detorsed small bowel was then placed on the right side of the abdomen, and the colon was placed on the left side with the cecum in the left upper quadrant, allowing broadening of the mesentery. The appendix was also removed in accordance with Ladd's procedure. The patient tolerated the operation well but required extended postoperative care to manage his renal failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation. The patient was discharged on the 10th postoperative day and followed for the next year and a half without subsequent problems."

    "abstract": "Appendiceal diverticulitis is a rare and often underdiagnosed condition that poses significant diagnostic challenges due to its atypical clinical presentation and similarity to acute appendicitis. We describe the case of a 37-year-old female patient who presented with acute abdominal pain and was ultimately diagnosed with appendicitis through computed tomography (CT). The patient underwent a successful laparoscopic appendectomy. This case underscores the diagnostic complexity of appendiceal diverticulitis, which is frequently mistaken for other causes of acute abdomen. The condition may be congenital or acquired, with differing pathophysiological mechanisms and histological features. Given the risk of complications such as perforation or neoplasia, prophylactic appendectomy is recommended even in cases of non-inflamed diverticula. Histopathological examination remains essential for definitive diagnosis. This case highlights the importance of heightened clinical suspicion and individualized surgical management in improving patient outcomes."

We report the successful use of EndoVAC therapy for management of an esophageal perforation secondary to foreign body removal. A 56-year-old man presented to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain after swallowing the plastic shell of a pill. Emergency endoscopy revealed an esophageal wall laceration (approximately 3 cm) and microperforation. The esophageal laceration and microperforation were limited to the mid-esophagus. The patient underwent EndoVAC therapy, which was repeated every 3-4 days for a total of six sessions over a period of 21 days. We observed improvement in the esophageal injury with granulation tissue formation during the fifth session. Subsequent follow-up evaluation, including esophagography and chest computed tomography confirmed complete healing of the esophageal injury.

We present a case report alongside an analysis of the ACS-NSQIP database to evaluate postoperative outcomes associated with concomitant Meckel diverticulectomy during laparoscopic appendectomy. We report the case of a 34 year-old woman presenting with acute appendicitis and an incidentally detected MD. The patient presented to the emergency department with right lower quadrant pain. Computed tomography revealed acute appendicitis with possible contained perforation. During laparoscopic operative management of her appendicitis, an incidental MD was noted and resected via a stapled diverticulectomy. She was discharged on the same day as her surgery without complication. Postoperative pathology examination revealed an MD without acute pathology. To review outcomes associated with performing incidental Meckel diverticulectomy during laparoscopic appendectomy, an additional 12-year retrospective ACS-NSQIP analysis was performed. To compare between laparoscopic appendectomy alone and Meckel diverticulectomy with appendectomy (MA), propensity matching was employed. MA was associated with a significantly increased operative time and longer hospital stays. However, no significant differences in 30-day mortality or postoperative outcomes were observed between the groups. Resection of incidental MD can be performed during laparoscopic appendectomy without significant morbidity or mortality."

This survey aimed to understand current surgical practices in WSCA use in the conservative approach to ASBO, and to evaluate key design and feasibility factors to inform a future controlled trial of WSCA in ASBO. This study is reported in line with CROSS guidance. The survey consisted of 16 questions organised into three sections: respondent characteristics, current decision-making and WSCA use, and opinions on future trial. Pilot testing was conducted before online distribution to surgeons in the UK delivering Emergency General Surgery. Descriptive analysis was performed. Of 73 total respondents, 52 (71.2%) were consultants. When treating ASBO conservatively, 80.8% (59/73) reported using WSCA in more than half of cases, but there was wide variation in timings, use and repeat challenges. Between 71.2% and 89.0% of respondents affirmed their willingness to adhere to specific trial protocols. Regarding feasibility, 76.7% (56/73) of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they would be willing to recruit to a trial and 75.3% (55/73) agreed or strongly agreed that their unit would be able to deliver a trial. The survey revealed widespread acceptance of WSCA as a therapeutic tool in ASBO among emergency general surgeons. Although practices around its administration varied, there was a clear readiness to adopt standardised protocols. The majority of respondents expressed support for a controlled trial comparing WSCA against a placebo."

    "abstract": "A percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for chronic total occlusion (CTO) carries a significant risk of coronary artery perforation (CAP). The typical treatment for proximal large CAP often requires the deployment of covered stents. However, this becomes impractical in situations where the antegrade wire has not successfully crossed the CTO lesion. In addition, emergency coronary artery bypass grafting for perforation after CTO-PCI is associated with a high in-hospital mortality rate. A patient presented with a left anterior descending artery (LAD) CTO involving the large first diagonal (D1) branch within the CTO segment. The D1 vessel was recanalized successfully using an antegrade approach. Before several attempts, the LAD CTO could n't be crossed, and an Ellis type Ⅲ perforation was visualized in the mid-LAD segment after bifurcation of the D1 vessel, which was created using a knuckled wire supported with a Corsair microcatheter. Subsequently, the perforation was effectively controlled by a tamponade balloon deployed from the D1 vessel to the proximal LAD. Before the retrograde wire crossed the LAD CTO, the dissection and re-entry techniques (DARTs) were used to recanalize the CTO lesion, intentionally creating subintimal dissection flaps. These autologous dissection flaps, together with drug-eluting stents instead of covered stents, successfully sealed the perforation. The innovative approach of using autologous dissection flaps created with DART in CTO-PCI to seal perforations is clinically feasible and effective."

These studies focused on acute respiratory infection (n = 5), intensive care unit decision (n = 5), head injury (n = 4), appendicitis (n = 4), febrile infant (n = 3), and other care decisions (n = 6). A breadth of outcome measures and measurement tools were used. In general, SDM interventions had positive impacts on patient-centered and clinical outcomes and were not accompanied by increased resource use, repeat health care utilization, or complications. Heterogeneity in SDM interventions and outcome measures limited the ability to conduct meta-analyses on intervention effectiveness. SDM interventions have been evaluated in several pediatric acute care settings. Across a range of studies, SDM interventions were observed to improve patient-centered outcomes without increasing complications. Additional research using standardized outcome measurements is needed."

    "abstract": "Introduction and importance: Spontaneous esophageal ruptures (SREs), also known as Boerhaave syndrome, are rare but potentially fatal medical emergencies characterized by full-layer perforation of the esophagus. Early identification and surgical intervention are critical for improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality rates. Case presentation: This study presents two case reports of patients with SREs who underwent surgical treatment. Both patients experienced lower esophageal segment perforations and were treated with emergency surgery for primary esophageal repair. One patient developed severe septic shock postoperatively and required intensive care and conservative treatment. Both patients recovered completely and had no late complications, such as esophageal strictures or feeding tube issues, at 6-month follow-up. Clinical discussion: This study reports surgical treatment experiences in two cases of SRE, a rare and fatal condition characterized by full-layer perforation of the esophagus. Early identification, diagnosis, and prompt surgical intervention are crucial for improving patient survival chances. The two cases involved lower esophageal segment perforation and underwent emergency surgery for primary esophageal repair. Healthcare providers should be vigilant for Boerhaave syndrome in patients presenting with acute chest and abdominal pain, particularly those with a history of vomiting. Thorough irrigation of the thoracic cavity during surgery is key to preventing septic shock postoperatively. Conclusion: Early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention are essential for managing SREs. Thorough surgical debridement and drainage are key to preventing postoperative complications and improving survival rates."

    "abstract": "Small bowel volvulus (SBV) is a rare yet potentially fatal cause of intestinal obstruction characterized by the twisting of the small intestine around its mesenteric axis. Prompt diagnosis and timely intervention are critical to preventing complications such as bowel ischemia, perforation, and sepsis. SBV can occur without a clear underlying pathology (idiopathic) or be associated with anatomical anomalies, such as Meckel's diverticulum (MD), accompanied by a meso-diverticular band (MDB). We report a rare case of SBV in an adult woman, resulting from MD complicated by the presence of an MDB. She presented with a two-day history of severe central abdominal pain, distension, vomiting, and obstipation. Imaging revealed features consistent with SBV without definitive identification of the underlying cause preoperatively. Urgent exploratory laparotomy was performed, identifying MD with MDB as the causative factors. The patient underwent small bowel resection and excision of MD along with the MDB. Surgical intervention remains the cornerstone of management for SBV, with early operative treatment crucial to minimizing morbidity and mortality. Although traditional laparotomy remains common, laparoscopic approaches are emerging as effective alternatives, offering potential advantages in diagnosis and management. This case underscores the importance of considering MD with MDB in adults presenting with SBV and highlights key surgical management strategies."

    "abstract": "Emergent repair of paraesophageal hernias (PEHs) is rare. This study aimed to compare outcomes of elective and urgent PEH repairs in patients with type II-IV PEHs. This was a single-center retrospective review of type II-IV PEHs from February 2014 to April 2024. The operations were classified as elective or urgent. Indications for urgent repair included acute incarceration and/or gastric outlet obstruction, which required immediate NGT decompression and/or EGD followed by definitive repair during the same hospital admission. Outcomes were 90-day hernia recurrence, mortality, readmission, and reoperation. Significant associations between operative cohort and outcomes were evaluated using univariable logistic regression. A total of 207 patients were included (female: 82%, median age: 64 years, ASA III: 57%). Type III PEH was most frequent (n = 116, 56%), followed by type IV (n = 64, 31%). There were 21 patients included in the urgent cohort. Of these, gastric decompression was performed via EGD in 16 patients (76%) and only NGT placement in two patients (10%). The median time to definitive repair was 6 [IQR 1.0-13.5] days. Laparoscopic (n = 126, 61%) and robotic (n = 75, 36%) approaches were similar between the elective and urgent cohorts (p = 0.70). Nissen fundoplication (n = 108, 52%) was the most common anti-reflux operation performed. The median length of stay (3 vs 4 days, p = 0.10) and hernia recurrence (n = 3 vs n = 1, p = 0.32) were comparable between the cohorts. There was one mortality in the urgent cohort secondary to a respiratory complication. Reoperations occurred in four patients, all in the elective cohort for gastric perforation, ischemic Roux limb, and early postoperative recurrence (n = 2). Readmissions included 18 (10%) and 3 patients (14%) from the elective and urgent cohorts, respectively (p = 0.55). Acutely incarcerated PEHs are infrequent and require immediate gastric decompression. In stable patients, definitive urgent MIS repair can be performed safely during the same admission, with low risk of postoperative complications or recurrence, comparable to elective operations."

We report a case of CVC catheter coiling that led to waveform distortion and required corrective measures. A 23-year-old female patient underwent an emergency laparotomy for perforation peritonitis with underlying pulmonary tuberculosis. During the procedure, a triple-lumen CVC was placed in the left internal jugular vein (IJV) after an unsuccessful right IJV cannulation attempt. Upon placement, the CVP was significantly elevated at 31.2 mmHg with a distorted waveform showing exaggerated 'v wave' and diminished 'x descent'. A point-of-care echocardiogram excluded right heart abnormalities. Postoperatively, a chest X-ray revealed coiling of the CVC in the superior vena cava (SVC), forming a fishhook pattern. The catheter was partially withdrawn by 2 cm, resulting in a reduction in CVP to 12 mmHg and normalization of the waveform. The catheter was subsequently removed and replaced without complications. Catheter coiling is an uncommon but significant complication of CVC, even when performed under ultrasound guidance. It can lead to inaccurate CVP readings and waveform distortion, which may affect clinical decisions. Early recognition of abnormal waveforms and partial withdrawal of the catheter can correct the coiling and restore accurate hemodynamic monitoring. This case underscores the importance of waveform analysis as a diagnostic tool for detecting catheter malposition and mechanical complications."

Researchers from various countries have evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its diagnosis and treatment, as well as a possible change in its management, such as outpatient treatment. The objective of this study was to describe the characteristics of acute appendicitis treated during the COVID-19 State of Emergency (SOE) and to assess whether it could be included in an ambulatory surgery program. Retrospective observational study involving patients treated at public hospitals for appendix diseases (K35-K38). We collected sociodemographic and clinical data. The influence of the lockdown on each variable was evaluated with a multivariate analysis. 201 patients were included. The SOE period group comprised 78 patients, and the pre-SOE period (control) included 123 patients who met the same inclusion criteria. The risk of complicated acute appendicitis increased by 1.015 times with age (p = 0.000). The longer surgery time was associated with a 7.265 times higher risk of postsurgical complications (p = 0.000). No differences were observed with respect to drain placement (p = 0.281), although the percentage was higher in 2020 (13.9% vs 19.7%).

The condition is most frequently reported in regions with high-fiber diets and anatomical predispositions, but remains a globally uncommon entity. Radiological imaging, particularly CT scans, plays a crucial role in preoperative diagnosis, with the whirl sign including sigmoid and ileum being a key diagnostic clue. However, most cases are only confirmed intraoperatively, and outcomes depend on the extent of bowel necrosis and the timeliness of surgical intervention. Mortality rates remain high, particularly in cases complicated by sepsis and multiorgan failure.

    "abstract": "Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) of the appendix are rare in children even though they are the second commonest gastrointestinal tumor next to lymphoma. NENs are usually diagnosed incidentally in appendectomies done for appendicitis, occasionally resulting in a second operation to ensure adequacy of the management. This case report is aimed at emphasizing the significance of subjecting any appendectomy specimen to histopathologic examination, irrespective of the indication for appendectomy. Here we presented a case of a 14-year-old male adolescent who presented with right lower quadrant abdominal pain of 16 h duration. He had leukocytosis with left shift, and the abdominal ultrasound examination concluded acute appendicitis, for which an emergency appendectomy was done. The histopathologic examination of the appendix along with the immunohistochemistry findings for synaptophysin concluded well differentiated neuroendocrine tumor WHO grade 1, AJCC stage PT3NxMx. Subsequent right hemicolectomy with lymphadenectomy was done due to the stage of the tumor. Appendiceal NENs are extremely uncommon in the global pediatric population and have benign behavior. The tip of the appendix is the commonest site of origin. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment, and size is the most determinant factor in determining the extent of surgery. Since most appendiceal neuroendocrine tumors are diagnosed incidentally, every appendectomy tissue should be submitted for histopathologic examination to identify the presence of a tumor and determine its stage."

    "title": "Double low-dose abdominopelvic CT for acute appendicitis: early exploratory analysis on image quality and diagnostic performance.",
    "abstract": "To evaluate the feasibility of a standardized double low-dose CT (DLCT) protocol that simultaneously reduces both iodine contrast media (CM) dose and tube voltage, and to compare its image quality and diagnostic performance with a single low-dose CT (SLCT) protocol using fixed iodine dose and reduced tube voltage, representative of institutional low-radiation dose imaging practice in suspected acute appendicitis. In this exploratory analysis of a prospective single-arm study, 49 participants aged 18-44 years presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected acute appendicitis underwent DLCT using automated kVp selection and a kVp- and weight-adjusted CM dosing protocol. This protocol targeted a 10% iodine dose reduction for every 10 kVp decrease from a reference standard of 0.521 g I/kg at 120 kVp. A historical control group of 53 patients with the same inclusion criteria, who had undergone SLCT using a fixed CM dose and low-kVp protocol (80-100 kVp) prior to study initiation, was retrospectively included. Quantitative (signal-to-noise ratio [SNR] and contrast-to-noise ratio [CNR]) and qualitative (subjective image quality and appendiceal visibility) assessments were compared. Diagnostic performance was evaluated using positive predictive value (PPV) for acute appendicitis and alternative diagnoses, based on surgical findings, clinical follow-up, or an Alvarado score ≥ 7. DLCT significantly reduced iodine dose (0.383 ± 0.049 g I/kg vs. 0.589 ± 0.085 g I/kg; P < 0.001) while maintaining comparable image noise and appendiceal visibility. Although SNR and CNR were lower in the DLCT group, diagnostic performance including PPVs for acute appendicitis (63.6% vs. 72.7%) and alternative diagnoses (100% vs. 86.7%) did not significantly differ between groups. An iodine dose-reducing DLCT protocol tailored to tube voltage and body weight is feasible in the ED setting and offers substantial CM dose saving without compromising diagnostic performance for acute appendicitis or alternative diagnoses."

    "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease, renders the colonic mucosa particularly vulnerable to complications during endoscopic procedures. This case illustrates a serious complication following colonoscopy in active disease. A 25-year-old female presented with two weeks of hematochezia. Colonoscopy revealed severe active inflammation with ulcerations, friability, and spontaneous bleeding throughout the examined colon, consistent with chronic ulcerative colitis. Histopathology confirmed chronic architectural distortion with acute inflammatory infiltrates. Four hours post-procedure, the patient developed acute abdominal pain with guarding. Imaging demonstrated pneumoperitoneum with free subdiaphragmatic air. Emergency laparotomy identified a 4- to 5-mm perforation at the splenic flexure, correlating with an area of severe endoscopic inflammation. The site showed marked wall thinning without evidence of malignancy. Surgical management included primary closure with omental patch reinforcement and peritoneal lavage. This case demonstrates several key clinical considerations. First, it highlights the increased perforation risk during colonoscopy in active ulcerative colitis, particularly in severely inflamed segments. The splenic flexure's anatomical vulnerability may further predispose to perforation. Second, it emphasizes the importance of early recognition, where prompt surgical intervention likely contributed to the patient's successful recovery despite significant peritoneal contamination. Third, it illustrates the decision-making process for primary repair versus resection in iatrogenic perforations. The patient's postoperative course included appropriate antibiotic therapy and gradual nutritional advancement. At the time of discharge, she showed marked clinical improvement with resolving inflammatory markers. This case underscores the need for careful risk-benefit assessment when performing colonoscopy in active colitis and reinforces the value of preparedness for potential complications."

The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of closed negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) against SSI in patients undergoing laparotomy for gastrointestinal perforation. This single-center, retrospective, observational study was carried out in a tertiary emergency medical center. We performed closed NPWT following emergency laparotomy for gastrointestinal perforation between May 2019 and May 2024, and compared it to standard dressings used between January 2016 and April 2019. Cases of open abdominal management were excluded. The primary outcome was the incidence of superficial and deep SSI between the two groups. The closed NPWT group comprised 65 patients, and the standard dressing group comprised 62 patients. There were no significant differences in patient characteristics, comorbidities, operative indications, and wound classification between the two groups. The rate of superficial and deep SSI was significantly lower with closed NPWT (26.2% with closed NPWT vs. 45.2% with standard dressing, p = 0.028). The application of closed NPWT in patients undergoing laparotomy for gastrointestinal perforation was associated with a lower incidence of SSI compared with that of a standard surgical dressing."

The underlying pathology in appendicitis occurs when the vermiform appendix, a vestigial organ connected to the large intestine, becomes swollen and inflamed. Some typical symptoms include abdominal pain, vomiting, fever, and appetite loss. Physical exam, imaging, and laboratory analyses are used to confirm the diagnosis. In this case report, a 15-year-old boy presented with vomiting and epigastric pain. Computed Tomography (CT) scans showed a fluid-filled appendix. Lab testing revealed elevated white blood cell counts, highlighting the importance of carefully analyzing test results.

    "abstract": "Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided pancreatic duct drainage (EUS-PD) has become a valuable alternative to conventional retrograde approaches in treating chronic pancreatitis, particularly in cases where transpapillary access is technically unfeasible. Although generally considered safe and effective, EUS-PD can lead to rare but serious complications, such as stent migration, hemorrhage, and peritonitis. The surgical management of these adverse events remains inadequately documented in the clinical literature. We present the case of a 72-year-old man with a long-standing history of alcohol-related chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic diabetes who developed severe epigastric pain due to multiple intraductal pancreatic stones. Several attempts at endoscopic retrograde pancreatic lithotomy failed due to anatomical difficulties. EUS-PD was subsequently performed, and a covered self-expandable metal stent was placed transgastrically into the main pancreatic duct (MPD). Immediately after deployment, bleeding into the gastric lumen was observed. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed stent migration from the MPD with active intraabdominal hemorrhage. The patient rapidly developed signs of peritonitis and hemodynamic instability, prompting an emergency laparotomy. Intraoperatively, the stent was found to have perforated the lesser and posterior gastric walls and was partially embedded in the pancreatic parenchyma. After removal of the stent, the gastric perforation was repaired, and hemostasis was achieved. A longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy (Partington-Rochelle procedure) was performed to manage the injured and dilated pancreatic duct. The postoperative course was uneventful, with complete resolution of abdominal symptoms and no development of a pancreatic fistula. This case highlights the need for heightened awareness of potentially life-threatening EUS-PD-related complications. It also underscores the importance of timely surgical intervention and demonstrates that the Partington-Rochelle procedure can be a practical and effective option in emergency settings for managing ductal disruption caused by stent migration."

We examined health care utilization and exposure to medical imaging between patients postappendectomy and those with an in situ appendix over the year after initial diagnosis. We hypothesized that nonoperative management would result in greater health care utilization than operative management in the year following index diagnosis. Using MarketScan, a commercial and fee-for-service Medicare claims database, we extracted patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute appendicitis and without perforation from 2017 to 2021, and either underwent appendectomy during index presentation or nonoperative treatment. We examined differences in abdominal pain related health care utilization within 1-year including ED visits, hospitalizations, and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans associated with the most common causes of ED presentation for abdominal pain. Of 26,588 patients presenting with uncomplicated appendicitis (female, 50.4%; mean [SD] age, 37.9 [15.3] years; mean [SD] Elixhauser comorbidity index, 0.8 [1.2]), 24,102 (90.6%) underwent appendectomy. At 1 year, 2,544 (9.6%) represented to the ED with an abdominal pain and/or appendicitis related diagnosis. Of nonoperatively managed patients, 78 (3.1%) underwent appendectomy for recurrent appendicitis at a median of 70 days, and 396 (15.9%) represented to the ED but did not undergo appendectomy. Emergency department visits, subsequent hospitalization, and abdominal CT scans were more common in the nonoperative group. After adjusting for patient sex, age, and Elixhauser comorbidity index, patients managed nonoperatively were approximately twice as likely (relative risk [RR], 2.10 [1.90-2.31]) to represent to the ED, be hospitalized (RR, 2.32 [1.94-2.76]), or undergo a CT scan (RR, 1.87 [1.68-2.08]) within 1 year. After adjusting for baseline characteristics, nonoperative management of uncomplicated appendicitis was associated with representation to the ED, rehospitalization, and repeat CT imaging.

Its presentation is typically with acute abdominal pain and fever following caesarean section (CS), and management involves broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical intervention. Conservative management is rare.We report two cases of VCP, which presented with abdominal masses 4 weeks following elective CS. CT scan demonstrated a soft tissue mass with diffuse peritoneal thickening, suspicious for an atypical infection or malignancy. Biopsy revealed non-necrotising granulomatous inflammation consistent with VCP. Both patients were managed conservatively and experienced a full recovery.In spite of increasing CS rates, VCP remains a rarely reported complication which may be underdiagnosed. It should be considered in patients presenting with abdominal pain beyond the usual timeframe for infection, with careful examination to detect any soft tissue masses. Conservative management, with biopsy for histological diagnosis, may be a safe option for systemically well women in whom urgent surgical intervention is not indicated."

We present a case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa endophthalmitis following routine myopic photorefractive keratectomy with mitomycin C application. The patient was referred to a tertiary ophthalmic service with severe post-operative infectious keratitis following initial management at another centre and was treated with intensive fortified antibiotics. The eye subsequently developed endophthalmitis with corneal perforation, necessitating urgent pars plan vitrectomy facilitated by a temporary keratoprosthesis and subsequent therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty. During anaesthetic induction, the patient developed anaphylaxis, most likely secondary to succinylcholine. Aggressive posterior positive pressure was encountered intra-operatively, resulting in spontaneous extrusion of the crystalline lens. We postulate that the posterior positive pressure was caused by several factors, including massive inflammation, and fluid shifts secondary to anaphylaxis and its associated management. The positive pressure was successfully managed and a keratoprosthesis was secured, allowing completion of vitrectomy and therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty. At 6-month follow-up, the vision remains at light perception. Endophthalmitis is an exceptionally rare but devastating complication following laser corneal refractive surgery, and the use of mitomycin C might have contributed to the rapid progression observed in the current case. Our report also highlights that acute anaphylaxis and its management can lead to posterior positive pressure, and measures should be taken to reduce the potential impacts before intraocular surgery and full-thickness incisions are made."

    "abstract": "Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive technique for en-bloc resection of superficial gastrointestinal lesions. However, the influence of prior manipulations, such as tattooing or endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), on ESD outcomes is not well understood. This retrospective cohort study evaluated 763 patients (mean age 64 years, 52% female) who underwent colorectal ESD at Brigham and Women's Hospital between 2014 and 2024. Outcomes included rates of en-bloc, R0, curative resection, and adverse events. Multivariable regression analysis identified factors associated with unsuccessful outcomes. The mean lesion diameter was 50 mm, with 54.4% located in the right colon. Prior tattooing occurred in 7% of cases while prior EMR was reported in 17% of lesions. En-bloc resection was achieved in 95% of cases, R0 resection in 89%, and curative resection in 88%. The mean procedure time was 64 min, with adverse events including delayed bleeding (3.3%), muscle injury (0.9%), and perforation (0.8%). Factors linked to unsuccessful en-bloc resection were prior tattooing (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.09-0.98; P = 0.047), prior EMR (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.12-0.82; P = 0.017), and submucosal fibrosis (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.07-0.53; P = 0.001). Submucosal fibrosis also reduced R0 and curative resection rates. No statistically significant associations between procedural adverse events and fibrosis, prior EMR, or tattooing were found. These findings highlight the importance of avoiding unnecessary pre-procedural manipulations and emphasize the need for urgent planning to optimize ESD outcomes."

    "abstract": "A 72-year-old female presented with acute abdominal pain, vomiting, and obstipation, suggestive of a small bowel obstruction (SBO). Her surgical history included an open tubal ligation performed over four decades earlier. On examination, the patient had a distended abdomen with tenderness, particularly in the right lower quadrant. Computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple dilated small bowel loops with a transition point in the pelvis. Although tubal ligation clips were observed on CT in this region, they were not initially considered a contributing factor. Conservative management failed to resolve the obstruction, leading to the need for emergent laparotomy. Intraoperatively, two tubal ligation clips were found to have eroded into the small bowel, creating an adhesional band resulting in the SBO. The clips had also induced a bowel stricture, necessitating resection and subsequent anastomosis. This case and the accompanying images illustrate a rare cause of SBO due to the migration of tubal ligation clips. This emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive surgical history and the potential for clip migration to contribute to adhesional SBO, which may be resistant to conservative treatment."

    "abstract": "Rectal bleeding is a common presenting complaint in the emergency department (ED), most frequently due to benign conditions like hemorrhoids, anal fissures, and diverticulitis. Malignancies are a less common cause, with colorectal adenocarcinomas being more typical. Melanomas, malignant tumors of melanocytes, primarily occur on the skin but can arise in less visible sites, including mucosal surfaces and rarely as pelvic masses. We report a case of a 56-year-old female who presented to the ED with rectal bleeding. Initial examination did not reveal a mass, and a prior history of hemorrhoids led to an initial discharge without further workup. However, subsequent presentation with abdominal pain prompted further investigation, revealing significant leukocytosis and anemia. Imaging studies, including chest radiography and CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, demonstrated multiple metastatic lesions in the lungs and liver, as well as a large retrorectal mass. Biopsies of a liver lesion and a rectal mass confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic melanoma. The patient was treated with immunotherapy but experienced clinical deterioration and ultimately elected for comfort measures, passing away approximately three months after the initial presentation, likely due to bowel obstruction secondary to the retrorectal melanoma. This report highlights the rare presentation of a stage IV retrorectal melanoma with initial rectal bleeding, emphasizing the importance of considering unusual malignancies in the differential diagnosis of this common symptom, particularly when initial assessments are non-diagnostic."

While nasoduodenal and gastrojejunostomy tubes are common, frequent dislodgements necessitate hospital visits for fluoroscopic-guided replacement, exposing children to radiation and potential anesthesia risks. The omega-jejunostomy (OJ) tube was developed as a simpler alternative to roux-en-Y feeding jejunostomy, allowing easy at-home tube changes after tract maturation. Despite nearly two decades of use, OJ-tube placement remains poorly characterized. This study examines patient factors and outcomes following OJ-tube placement in children at a single center. A retrospective review was conducted on 23 pediatric patients who underwent OJ-tube placement at an academic children's hospital (2016-2024). We analyzed demographic, perioperative, and outcome data, including volvulus incidence, reoperations, emergency department (ED) visits, and readmissions. Intestinal volvulus occurred in 17.4 % (n = 4), requiring emergent laparotomy. Patients with volvulus had longer hospital stays (12.0 vs. 3.5 days, p = 0.02) and higher 30-day readmission rates (100 % vs. 15.8 %, p = 0.004). Intestinal dysmotility was present in 75 % of volvulus cases, suggesting a predisposition (p = 0.07). ED visits occurred in 73.9 % of patients, primarily due to clogged (35.3 %) or dislodged tubes (29.4 %). OJ-tube placement is an effective feeding option but carries risks, including volvulus and frequent ED visits. Intestinal dysmotility may predispose patients to volvulus, warranting careful patient selection and monitoring. Improved caregiver education and mechanical complication management may reduce ED utilization. Further multicenter research is needed to assess volvulus risk in this population.

The patient underwent an emergent thoracostomy, laparotomy with Graham omentoplasty, and extensive debridement with successful outcome. While rare complications like pneumothorax and necrotizing soft tissue infections have been documented, their simultaneous occurrence from a nontraumatic ulcer perforation is unprecedented in literature. Previous reports suggest enteric contents can traverse retroperitoneal fascial planes and peritoneal defects to reach distant anatomical sites as a possible mechanism for these complications. This case highlights the potential for atypical presentations of PUD and the importance of comprehensive evaluation, early recognition, and prompt surgical intervention."

    "abstract": "Ectopic gastric mucosa (EGM) is a hyperplastic primitive gut epithelium found in tissues other than the stomach. EGM in the small intestine, distal to the ligament of Treitz (EGMdT), is uncommon. EGMdT without congenital anomalies has rarely been reported. Most reported cases are diagnosed in youth, with a single lesion and urgent symptoms requiring emergency surgery. Herein, we report a unique case of multiple EGMdTs without congenital anomalies that caused progressive ileal stenosis in an elderly patient with an observation period of 11 years. The patient was a 77-year-old man. On a medical exam 11 years before arrival at our hospital, the patient was diagnosed with EGMdT in the terminal ileum without stenosis. Five years after the initial diagnosis of EGMdT, the patient experienced his first episode of bowel obstruction, which was treated conservatively. The patient experienced three episodes of bowel obstruction, all of which were treated conservatively. The patient was then referred to our hospital for further examination and treatment. Colonoscopy at our hospital showed an EGMdT that protruded from the Bauhin's valve. Double-balloon colonoscopy revealed a lymph follicle-like elevation 20 cm from the Bauhin's valve with obvious stenosis. No malignancies were found on lesion biopsy. The fluoroscopic gastrointestinal series showed five lesions on the oral side of the Bauhin's valve. Based on these findings, the patient's symptoms were considered as the outcome of ileal stenosis caused by multiple EGMdTs; therefore, surgical resection was recommended. Laparoscopic resection of the lesion was performed. Intraoperative findings were not suspicious of malignancy. There were five erosions in the resected specimen, and all lesions were diagnosed as EGMdTs without malignancies. The patient was discharged on the 7th postoperative day without any complications. The patient had no recurrent symptoms after discharge. Based on the present case, we recommend that clinicians consider surgical resection for symptomatic EGMdT, even without malignancy, and screen for multiple lesions to avoid residual EGMdT."

    "abstract": "Peritonitis or inflammation of the peritoneum is a leading cause of mortality in surgical patients. Perforation of the gastrointestinal tract (perforation peritonitis) is one of the commonest origins and a rapidly fatal disease. The Mannheim Peritonitis Index (MPI) is a scoring system used to forecast outcomes for individuals suffering from peritonitis that uses a straightforward bedside grading method. This study aimed to determine how well the MPI predicts clinical outcomes for individuals who have perforation peritonitis in an Indian setting. This study was a prospective observational study conducted over two years at a tertiary care hospital in India with a sample size of 72 patients. The study population comprised patients aged over 18 years who presented to the emergency department with clinical and radiological suspicion of perforation peritonitis, which was later confirmed intraoperatively. Pregnant women and patients below 18 years of age were excluded. The variables found in the MPI were assigned the values indicated, and the total MPI score for each patient was calculated. The cases were then grouped into three groups, viz those with an MPI below 21 points, between 21 and 29 points, and those above 29 points. Patients were followed up, and outcomes were recorded in terms of discharge, morbidity or mortality. Morbidity was specifically measured in terms of surgical site infection, wound dehiscence, intra-abdominal abscess formation, acute renal failure and pulmonary complications. Higher MPI scores on presentation directly correlated with a greater severity of disease in terms of post-operative morbidity and mortality. The overall mortality rate was 16.7%, with a clear correlation between higher MPI scores and increased mortality. As far as post-operative systemic complications were concerned, patients with a higher preoperative MPI were more likely to develop complications like acute kidney injury and pulmonary complications like pneumonia postoperatively. Surgical site infections occurred in 44.4% of patients, and wound dehiscence in 16.7%. Of the four patients who subsequently developed an intra-abdominal abscess, three had an MPI greater than 29 on presentation. The findings of this study demonstrate that the MPI is a valuable tool for stratifying patients of perforation peritonitis, with higher MPI scores correlating with worse clinical outcomes, including organ failure, wound complications, and mortality. The demographic analysis of our study revealed a significant male predominance and a relatively young patient population, suggesting regional or demographic factors. The high incidence of organ failure, particularly among those with higher MPI scores, underscores the critical nature of perforation peritonitis and the necessity for intensive care support."

    "abstract": "About 1%-2% of pregnant patients develop conditions that require emergency general surgery (EGS). The diagnosis and management of these conditions can be challenging, as surgeons must carefully balance the needs of the pregnant patient and the developing fetus. We sought to summarize the latest literature guiding surgical management of appendicitis, benign biliary disease, bowel obstruction, and hemorrhoids in pregnant patients. We performed a comprehensive scoping review using OVID Medline for articles published between January 2000 and June 2023 pertaining to EGS and pregnancy. Acute appendicitis, benign biliary disease, and bowel obstructions confer increased risk of adverse maternal and fetal obstetrical outcomes. In general, pregnant patients with acute appendicitis and cholecystitis should undergo appendectomy or cholecystectomy, respectively. The management of biliary colic has significant nuance depending on trimester. While an operative approach is favoured in the first 2 trimesters, the role of surgery in the third trimester is less clear. Nonoperative treatment of each of these diseases can result in significant maternal, and possibly fetal, morbidity. Operative management of bowel obstruction must be determined on a case-by-case basis. In all instances, a laparoscopic approach is preferred, if feasible. A thoughtful approach is crucial for surgeons and institutions caring for pregnant patients with EGS diseases. Treatment should be similar to that in nonpregnant patients, with some important considerations and modifications. Nonoperative or delayed operative management often increases adverse obstetrical events, including death. Environ 1 %–2 % des personnes enceintes devront subir une intervention urgente en chirurgie générale pour un problème de santé dont le diagnostic et la prise en charge sont parfois complexes, car il faut judicieusement prendre en compte les besoins de la personne enceinte et ceux du foetus. Nous avons voulu faire le point sur les directives récemment publiées relativement au traitement chirurgical de l’appendicite, de la maladie biliaire bénigne, de l’obstruction intestinale et des hémorroïdes chez les personnes enceintes. Nous avons procédé à une étude de portée globale à partir du réseau OVID Medline pour y trouver les articles publiés entre janvier 2000 et juin 2023 sur les interventions d’urgence en chirurgie générale et la grossesse. L’appendicite, la maladie biliaire bénigne et l’obstruction intestinale aggravent le risque de complications maternelles et foetales. En général, les personnes enceintes aux prises avec une appendicite ou une cholécystite doivent subir respectivement une appendicectomie ou cholécystectomie. La prise en charge de la colique hépatique varie selon trimestre de grossesse. Une approche chirurgicale est préférable au cours des 2 premiers trimestres, mais son rôle est moins clair pour le troisième trimestre. L’approche non chirurgicale pour chacun de ces problèmes de santé peut comporter une morbidité maternelle significative et une morbidité foetale potentielle. Le recours à la chirurgie pour l’obstruction intestinale est déterminé au cas par cas. Une approche laparoscopique est toujours à privilégier si possible. Les établissements qui ont un service d’obstétrique et les équipes chirurgicales doivent impérativement adopter une approche rigoureuse face à des personnes enceintes nécessitant une intervention en chirurgie générale. Le traitement doit équivaloir à celui qui est destiné aux personnes non enceintes, moyennant certaines considérations et modifications importantes. Les modalités non chirurgicales ou un retard à les appliquer augmentent souvent le risque de complications obstétricales, y compris un risque de mortalité."

    "title": "Esophageal Rupture and Mediastinitis Following Blakemore Tube Tamponade: A Cardiothoracic Emergency and Protocol-Based Prevention.",
    "abstract": "The Sengstaken-Blakemore tube (SBT) is a balloon tamponade system employed as a temporary measure to achieve short-term hemostasis in patients experiencing uncontrolled bleeding from gastroesophageal varices. While these tubes are generally well-tolerated, they carry a risk of significant complications, including mucosal necrosis, aspiration pneumonia, esophageal perforation, and rebleeding after deflation of the balloon. Among these, esophageal perforation is a particularly rare but life-threatening complication that may result from improper placement or over-inflation of the balloon. This report presents a rare case of Blakemore tube-induced esophageal perforation, resulting from balloon misplacement, in a patient receiving treatment for variceal hemorrhage. The objectives of this case report are to highlight the potential for serious complications arising from improper tube placement and to provide guidance on preventing such incidents. This report emphasizes the need for monitoring of balloon tamponade devices and verification of proper tube positioning before and after the inflation of the gastric balloon, especially in emergency settings where rapid intervention is essential. By outlining the clinical presentation, diagnostic challenges, and treatment strategies in this case, we aim to enhance clinician awareness of the rare but serious risks associated with SBT use and provide practical guidance for minimizing complications, improving patient outcomes, and ensuring the safety and effectiveness of this life-saving procedure."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency caused by inflammation and infection of the appendix, yet there is limited consensus on its management despite its widespread prevalence. While surgery remains the standard, the role of antibiotics, particularly in nonoperative management, is increasingly recognized. This study aims to identify the antibiotic regimens for appendicitis in three governmental and military hospitals in Taif City, assess their consistency with international guidelines, review effectiveness, and determine the length of hospital stay for patients following different treatment methods.  Method: A retrospective chart review design was used to analyze the antibiotics regimen used for managing appendicitis and perforated appendicitis among patients of various age groups in Taif City. Data was collected from the medical records of patients admitted to pediatric and adult surgery units from January 2020 to December 2022. SPSS software, version 26.0, was used for descriptive analysis, while inferential statistical tests were used to compare hospital stays.  Results: The study analyzed 646 hospital records for patients with appendicitis. Surgical interventions were common, with open appendectomy being the most common procedure, 522 (80.8%). Only 25 (3.9%) patients received preoperative antibiotics, while 481 (74.5%) patients received postoperative antibiotics, mostly Augmentin, with oral administration being preferred in 450 (69.7%) cases. Postoperative outcomes showed low complication rates, with only 54 (8.4%) experiencing surgical-site infections, hernia, and minimal abdominal pain. The mean hospital stay was 2.2 days.  Conclusion: The study suggests that compliance with preoperative antibiotic guidelines should be improved, and nonoperative management options should be discussed in certain patient populations. The focus should be on rational antibiotic usage and patient-oriented treatment methods to maximize appendicitis treatment compared to existing literature."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Cases of pharyngeal perforation (PP) associated with cervical spine injury following blunt trauma are extremely rare. CASE REPORT A 58-year-old woman was hit by a car while riding an electric bicycle. She presented with neck pain and dyspnea on admission to the hospital. The CT scan showed suspected fractures of the 5th and 6th cervical vertebrae without evidence of cervical emphysema. Serial blood tests revealed a rapidly decreasing hemoglobin level. An urgent surgical exploration of the neck was performed. Intraoperative findings included complete tears of the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments of the cervical spine, rupture of the 5th and 6th cervical intervertebral discs, and a longitudinal laceration of the posterior pharyngeal wall. The patient underwent surgical management, which included PP repair and cervical spine infusion via an anterior cervical approach. The buccopharyngeal fascia was sutured to the prevertebral fascia to seal the connection between the PP and the prevertebral space. The patient recovered well after surgery. The 3-month postoperative follow-up showed a stable cervical spine and good healing of the PP. CONCLUSIONS We present the first case of PP associated with severe cervical spine injury following blunt trauma. Direct laryngoscopy is essential to establish the presence of PP and to assess the size and location of the injury. In this rare case, suturing the buccopharyngeal fascia and prevertebral fascia to isolate the PP and spinal implant was effective in preventing implant infection and surgical failure potentially caused by salivary leakage."

    "title": "Appendicular band syndrome leading to small bowel obstruction: A case report of a rare complication of acute appendicitis.",
    "abstract": "Appendicular band syndrome is an extremely rare surgical emergency, and only a few cases have been reported in the literature. Although intestinal obstruction comprises 2 % - 8 % of the cases of acute abdomen presenting to emergency, obstruction due to appendicular band syndrome is a rare entity. A 43-year-old male presented with features suggestive of small bowel obstruction for 5 days. On examination, the abdomen was distended and tense with generalized mild tenderness all over the abdomen. CECT (abdomen and pelvis) showed a transition point in the distal ileum, with dilated bowel loops proximal to it. On exploratory laparotomy, the appendix was found completely encircling the distal ileum, forming a constricting band, for which release of appendicular band with appendectomy was done. The initiating event in appendicular band syndrome is acute appendicitis itself. Due to the inflammation of appendix, its tip gets adhered to the caecum, retro-peritoneum, ileal mesentery, or ileum itself, forming a potential gap. A segment of bowel may herniate through this gap and become entrapped, resulting in closed-loop obstruction and subsequent strangulation. In the absence of bowel strangulation, releasing the appendicular band along with appendectomy is sufficient. However, if the bowel loop is found to be gangrenous, resection with primary anastomosis is warranted. Appendicular band syndrome, often diagnosed intraoperatively, should be kept in mind as one of the differential diagnoses when evaluating patients with features of bowel obstruction. Early diagnosis guides incision planning, while timely surgical intervention is crucial for preventing serious complications."

    "abstract": "Male occult breast cancers are extremely rare and often difficult to diagnose. With only few cases reported, no established treatment is available. And metastatic spread to the small intestine from a tumor originating outside the peritoneal cavity is rare. However, there is a higher tendency for metastasis to the peritoneal cavity, including the small bowel, in the case of lobular carcinoma of the breast. A 72-year-old man who initially presented with complaints of abdominal distention. Computed tomography revealed small bowel stenosis. Post-endoscopic stenosis dilatation, an emergency small bowel resection was performed for small bowel perforation. Postoperative histopathology revealed small bowel metastasis due to mammary gland lobular carcinoma with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (3+), estrogen receptor-negative, and progesterone receptor-negative status; the patient was then referred to our hospital. Imaging examinations revealed multiple lymph node metastases in the cervical region, right supraclavicular area, mediastinum, hilar region, and splenic portal. However, no obvious breast lesions or axillary lymph node metastases were identified, leading to a diagnosis of metastatic occult breast cancer. Complete response was achieved with trastuzumab plus pertuzumab plus docetaxel therapy; 30 months after chemotherapy initiation, multiple brain metastases were detected. Thus, 30 Gy whole-brain radiotherapy was performed followed by second-line treatment with trastuzumab emtansine. The patient died 4 years and 8 months after the disease onset, due to the progression of the disease with the new brain metastases. For male occult breast cancer, it is important to understand the potential metastatic patterns and genetic factors, as well as to utilize comprehensive diagnostic methods for early diagnosis and disease management."

    "abstract": "While locally advanced rectal cancer is the first clinical suspicion for severe rectal stenosis, in extremely unusual cases a lower bowel obstruction may be related to bladder metastasis. We present the case of a 64-year-old male who was admitted for occlusive rectal tumor (4 cm from the anal verge), for which an emergency loop-colostomy was performed. After two inconclusive endoscopic biopsies, a transanal rectal tru-cut biopsy allowed for the detection of high-grade urothelial carcinoma with signet ring cells. Furthermore, primary origin was detected in a small bladder tumor. In imaging reassessment after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, regression of the lesions both from the bladder and rectum was observed. Radical surgery with total pelvic exenteration was considered in the absence of other secondary tumors, but the patient declined and continued with radiotherapy. Subsequently he developed malignant chylous ascites and unfortunately died three months later. Reviewing the literature, we found twenty-five cases of urothelial metastasis to the rectum, originating from the bladder, including this newly present case. Rectal metastasis of urothelial origin poses a two-fold challenge in terms of both diagnosis and treatment. Determining the specific features of this uncommon manifestation of a common disease will improve future approaches."

    "title": "Spontaneous Endometrioma Rupture: A Retrospective Pilot Study and Literature Review of a Rare and Challenging Condition.",
    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Endometriosis can present as ovarian endometriosis in 15-25% of the cases. While chronic pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea dominate its clinical presentation, acute complications, such as spontaneous OMA rupture, are rare (<3%), often mimicking acute abdominal pain and necessitating emergency surgery. Diagnostic delays persist due to the condition's rarity and overlapping symptoms with ovarian torsion or appendicitis. This study investigates the clinical features of ruptured OMAs to enhance preoperative suspicion and optimize management. Methods: From February 2011 to August 2023, 14 patients with spontaneous rupture of histologically confirmed endometriomas underwent emergency laparoscopy for acute abdominal pain in the University Hospital of Bern, Switzerland. The clinical data of these patients were analyzed to find common patterns of spontaneous endometrioma ruptures. We also conducted a literature search in PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Cochrane, and Embase databases from inception to December 2023 in order to identify other possible confounding factors. The search was based on the keywords \"ruptured endometrioma\". All English full-text prospective and retrospective observational and interventional studies with at least five patients that described the clinical features and findings of women diagnosed with ruptured endometrioma and treated surgically were included. Results: The median age at operation was 37.4 (23-49) years old, and all cases presented with acute abdominal pain, with/without peritonitis. Only 3/14 patients presented with fever, while the most common laboratory finding was an elevated CRP level of 45.6 mg/L (3-100 mg/L), while leukocytosis was less pronounced, with a median of 12.2 G/L (6.04-21.4 G/L). Notably, 64.3% (9 out of 14) of the patients reported experiencing dysmenorrhea, while for the remaining 5 individuals, the presence or absence of dysmenorrhea could not be obtained. Interestingly, only one patient had undergone hormonal treatment, with a combined oral contraceptive (COC) of Ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg) and Desogestrel (0.15 mg), while the other patients either lacked awareness of their endometriosis or expressed reluctance towards hormonal downregulation therapy. The median endometrioma size was 7 cm (3.5-18 cm), and 78.57% of the cases (11 out of 14 patients) had only ovarian endometriosis, while only 3 patients had involvement of compartment A, B, or C according to the # ENZIAN classification. Conclusions: Though rare, spontaneous OMA rupture should be considered in acute abdomen cases, especially with cysts > 5 cm. Hormonal therapy may reduce rupture risk, but more research is needed to confirm this and refine diagnostic strategies."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND The use of implantable cardiac devices, including permanent pacemakers, has become routine, and reported complications are rare. However, in some cases, a cardiac pacemaker lead can perforate the ventricular or atrial wall. However, patients can present with nonspecific and heterogeneous clinical manifestations, leading to potential delays in diagnosis. We present a case of a 61-year-old man with perforation of the left ventricle and pericardium diagnosed 3 days after the insertion of a cardiac pacemaker lead. CASE REPORT A 61-year-old man with symptomatic second-degree type II sinoatrial block underwent uneventful dual-chamber permanent pacemaker implantation. On the evening of the third day following the pacemaker implantation procedure, the patient presented with persistent chest pain and was admitted to the hospital. Emergency chest computed tomography demonstrated that the right ventricular pacemaker lead had penetrated the left ventricle and pericardium. The patient underwent surgery on the fourth day of admission, and the pacing lead was secured to the left ventricular myocardium via a small incision in the left intercostal space. The surgical procedure was completed successfully, and the patient was discharged on the third postoperative day, without any complications. CONCLUSIONS Cardiac perforation due to the lead is a rare but potentially fatal complication of pacemaker implantation. We present a patient who presented with a left ventricular and pericardium perforation 3 days after pacemaker implantation. This clinical case underscores the necessity for screening for perforation in patients treated with cardiac implantable electronic devices prior to discharge."

    "abstract": "Side branch compromise due to extraplaque hematoma often complicates chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) involving a bifurcation at the distal cap. To evaluate the feasibility and short-term outcomes of Snare-Assisted LAceration of Subintimal Hematoma (SLASH), a novel technique designed to mitigate this problem. SLASH involves retrograde true lumen wiring across the distal bifurcation into a distal side branch, followed by successful antegrade dissection/re-entry into the same branch. A microsnare is then delivered antegradely and used to capture a retrogradely advanced externalization guidewire. Once snared, controlled traction is applied, inducing a longitudinal laceration of the vessel media and intima, which decompresses the subintimal hematoma at the bifurcation. We conducted a multicenter evaluation to assess the procedural feasibility and outcomes of this technique. SLASH was performed in 12 complex CTO PCI cases (mean J-CTO score 3.5 ± 0.67). SLASH was successful in 10 (83%) cases, while technical and procedural success was achieved in 9 (75%) cases. In 2 cases, SLASH was unsuccessful due to an inability to deliver the microsnare sheath or failure to snare the retrograde guidewire. No cases of coronary perforation, emergent surgery, or other major procedural complications were observed. In one case, retrograde wire entrapment at a distal graft anastomosis was successfully resolved with rotational atherectomy-induced wire fracture. SLASH is a feasible and effective technique for hematoma decompression and revascularization in bifurcation CTO PCI. Further multicenter studies are warranted to validate its reproducibility, safety, and long-term efficacy."

Sugar, a traditional remedy for wound healing, has shown significant efficacy in accelerating recovery. Here, we developed a new strategy for managing bevacizumab-associated delayed wound healing with the topical application of sugar. A 42-year-old female with non-small cell lung cancer and brain metastases who underwent emergency surgical treatment for acute appendicitis while on bevacizumab developed delayed wound healing postoperatively. At 50 days postoperatively, the wound was still approximately 2 cm, indicating bevacizumab-associated delayed wound healing. The patient had enlarged brain metastases and increased edema due to discontinuation of bevacizumab. Bevacizumab was reintroduced without complete wound healing. Concurrently, topical sugar was applied following routine wound disinfection. The wound completely healed 21 days after initiating sugar therapy, coinciding with ongoing bevacizumab treatment. The patient's wound healed completely with the application of topical sugar, even in the context of ongoing bevacizumab therapy, highlighting the efficacy of sugar in managing bevacizumab-induced delayed wound healing."

Thus, the aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the Alvarado scoring system based on the prospectively included subjects who presented to the emergency department with suspected AA. From June 2018 to May 2020, 176 adult patients examined in the Emergency surgical department of University Hospital Sveti Duh with suspicion of AA were prospectively included in the study. The decision on the need for surgery in all patients was made by the same surgeon based only on clinical judgment and remained independent of any diagnostic scoring system. Fifty-eight (33.0%) of them were operated with negative appendectomy rate of 17.2%. Results showed that the surgeon's decision-making process is superior to the Alvarado scoring system (sensitivity and specificity were 96 and 92.06% vs. 84 and 87.30%, respectively). The Alvarado scoring system proved to be a worse predictor of the diagnosis of AA compared to the assessment of an experienced surgeon and is not an adequate diagnostic tool for confirming the diagnosis. Only in a narrow group of patients in whom, based on the clinical examination, an indication for surgery has already been established, the Alvarado scoring system can potentially be useful in excluding the diagnosis with considerable caution in terms of close follow-up of the patient.Abbreviations: MSCT: multislice computed tomography; AA: acute appendicitis."

    "abstract": "In this review article we survey the literature for current evidence in pediatric practice regarding the use of elevated band count in the pediatric emergency room. In addition, we present data from the literature on the wide variability of manual band counts to reconsider its utility in clinical practice. Bandemia is commonly seen during a state of infection. Band count is determined by manual cell count and can be prone to inaccuracy and imprecision. Despite its shortcomings, the 100-cell manual differential count remains the most practical method for assessing left shift. All the literature involving the use of elevated band count as a biomarker in pediatrics available on PubMed and Google Scholar was surveyed. \"Bandemia\", \"Band count\", \"left shift\" and \"immature neutrophils\" were used as primary search terms, in conjunction with the term \"pediatrics.\" The most recent AAP guidelines do not incorporate band count in decision making for febrile neonates. Elevated band count is related to worse outcomes in non-operative management of appendicitis. Elevated band count can be seen in viral illness alone. Even severe bandemia (<20%) does not correlate with severe illness. More studies are needed to definitively dispel the notion of bandemia and its association with invasive bacterial infection. Additionally, pediatric providers may benefit from professional society guidelines advising appropriate management of the pediatric patient with elevated band count."

    "abstract": "Background Ultrasound has emerged as the preferred initial imaging modality for diagnosing acute appendicitis in children, but most data supporting its use come from academic children's medical centers. The purpose of this investigation is to describe ultrasound utilization for diagnosing acute appendicitis in children at a large community hospital network. Methods This was a multicenter retrospective observational cohort study and chart review of pediatric patients with acute appendicitis diagnosed in the emergency department (ED). The primary outcome of this study was the proportion of patients diagnosed with ultrasound as the sole imaging modality, presented as a population proportion with a 95% confidence interval. Results There were 450 patients included. The mean age was 10 years (range 3-17). Among the 450 patients, there were a total of 713 imaging studies. Only 213 (47.3%) patients had a single imaging test ordered during the ED encounter, and only 52 patients (11.6%) had an ultrasound during the encounter as the only imaging modality. The initial study ordered was a CT scan in 184 (40.9%), an ultrasound in 172 (38.2%), and an X-ray in 94 (20.9%). Sixty-two of 172 (36.0%) ultrasounds were positive for appendicitis. Of the 62 positive studies, 11 (17.7%) had a confirmatory CT scan. Conclusion In this community hospital network, patients had multiple imaging modalities ordered to confirm the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Less than half had an ultrasound ordered as the initial imaging modality, suggesting its use is not as widespread as academic data may indicate. Despite a positive diagnostic ultrasound, some patients went on to have a confirmatory CT scan, which provides further opportunity to improve."

    "abstract": "Concomitant perforation of the duodenum and gallbladder is exceptionally rare in the pediatric population. These conditions pose significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, particularly in critically ill or sedated children. We report the case of a five-year-old girl who was initially hospitalized for posterior fossa tumor resection and developed acute abdominal distension, anemia, and hematemesis in the postoperative period. Imaging was limited because of the hemodynamic instability. Emergency exploratory laparotomy revealed a large duodenal perforation and a concomitant gallbladder perforation. The surgical management included primary duodenal repair, cholecystectomy, and gastroduodenal bypass. Despite intensive supportive care, the patient succumbed to sepsis and multiorgan failure on postoperative day 2. This case highlights the diagnostic difficulty of gastrointestinal perforations in sedated intensive care unit patients, the possible pathophysiological link between duodenal ulcers and adjacent gallbladder inflammation, and the urgency for surgical intervention. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion of stress-related gastrointestinal complications in critically ill children. Early surgical exploration may be life-saving when imaging is inconclusive and clinical deterioration is rapid."

Case Presentation: We report a case of an otherwise healthy 4-month-old, predominantly breastfed infant with episodic \"honking\" breathing, choking with feeds, and a 2-month history of recurrent croup episodes requiring emergency services and an hospital admission. After referral to pediatric otolaryngology/respirology, a flexible laryngoscopy revealed a diagnosis of mild laryngomalacia, inconsistent with the severity of symptoms. A formal airway evaluation was performed, including supraglottoplasty. Results: Unexpectedly, extraluminal pulsatile tracheal compression was found, with correlating computed tomography findings of an innominate artery variation and a paraesophageal abnormality. This abnormality appeared as a fluid-filled density between the esophagus and trachea on magnetic resonance imaging, without patency to the esophagus on Upper GI series. Differential diagnoses included vascular malformation, esophageal diverticulum, and bronchogenic/foregut duplication cyst. Although evaluation with echoendoscopy was considered, collaboration with general/thoracic surgery for a flexible esophagoscopy revealed a 2-cm breast pump membrane embedded in a pseudo-diverticulum with a sealed esophageal perforation, which concluded with successful object removal via forceps. The patient's respiratory symptoms have resolved; however, persistence of the pseudo-diverticulum on follow-up imaging and endoscopy warrants ongoing surveillance. Conclusion: This case demonstrates the challenging diagnosis of a breast pump membrane as an unexpected esophageal FBA, compounded by nonspecific respiratory symptoms and the membrane's near-radiolucency on standard imaging. The exhibited multidisciplinary, collaborative approach was fundamental for the complication-free removal of the membrane."

In this study, an AMeI rat model was established to investigate the efficacy of immunophenotyping to reveal a biomarker of AMeI. Twenty-one adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups. In the Sham group (Group 1), after laparotomy, the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was found, and no further intervention was performed. In the ischemia-reperfusion group (Group 2), SMA was occluded only for 45 min whereas in Group 3(ischemia group), SMA was permanently occluded. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were quantified for T cell subsets using flow cytometry. Regarding hematological biomarkers, only mean platelet volume (MPV) values in Group 3 were significantly higher compared to Group 2 (p = 0.0134). Platelet lymphocyte ratio values and D dimer levels were higher in Group 3 compared to the sham Group (p = 0.0219, p = 0.0012; respectively). No statistically significant difference was detected between groups considering the subtypes of lymphocytes surface antigens. However, in the correlation matrix analysis, significant correlations were observed between Chiu histopathological stage of ileum mucosa and CD45+ and CD4 + CD8 + [Spearman r = 0.571 (95% CI: 0.172-0.809) p = 0.0068 and Spearman r = 0.4908 (95% CI: 0.061-0.767) p = 0.0239].

Here, it may manifest as intestinal, peritoneal, hepato-pancreato-biliary TB, or as TB lymphadenitis. We report a case of small bowel obstruction secondary to peritoneal TB deposits in a patient who had previous received BCG vaccination. The patient was managed with emergency laparotomy and received TB treatment post-operatively. This article highlights the innocuous presentation of peritoneal TB and difficulties obtaining a diagnosis. Furthermore, we review the efficacy of the BCG vaccine and remind the reader of the importance of a travel history in the acute abdomen setting."

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for animal products highlights the need to prioritize the reproductive health of cattle. Bovine Trichomonosis, an underexplored disease, causes severe reproductive failures in cattle. At present, early diagnosis and the quarantine of infected animals remain the primary strategies for disease control. Several reports of Trichomonas foetus spillover resulting in cases of Pneumocystis pneumonia, meningoencephalitis, peritonitis, and cholecystitis in immunocompromised individuals suggest a potential risk of zoonotic transmission. Consequently, there is an urgent need for Simple, affordable and rapid diagnostic tools to support the dairy farming community and to mitigate the risk of zoonotic spread zoonotic transmission. Addressing this need, the present study aimed at developing a rapid Lateral Flow Assay (LFA) utilizing recombinant Cysteine Protease8 antigen for the detection of T. foetus-specific antibodies in infected hosts. The prototype LFA exhibited diagnostic performance comparable to that of iELISA and RT -PCR, with a sensitivity of 89.4 %, specificity of 100 %, and an overall accuracy of 97.8 %. These results are consistent with those reported for LFA kits targeting other sexually transmitted infections in cattle developed world wide. Due to its high sensitivity and ease of application, the prototype LFA is well-suited for on-site use by farmers and for routine herd-level surveillance of Bovine Trichomonosis. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first Point-of-Care prototype LFA kit developed globally for the specific detection of Bovine Trichomonosis."

    "title": "The effect of chewing gum on postoperative ileus after laparotomy for gastroduodenal perforations: a randomized controlled trial.",
    "abstract": "Prolonged postoperative ileus is linked to a higher risk of additional complications, longer hospital stays, and higher healthcare expenses. There are few randomized controlled trials on the impact of chewing gum on the duration of ileus in patients undergoing emergency surgery, notably those with peritonitis. Compelling evidence from studies on elective procedures demonstrates that chewing gum can lessen the duration of ileus. This trial aimed to examine the effect of chewing gum on the length of the postoperative ileus which develop after laparotomy for gastroduodenal perforations. Multicentre randomized controlled trial. Fifty-two patients were randomly assigned to two treatment groups. Group A received routine care with chewing gum, while group B only received routine care. The primary outcome was the length of postoperative ileus, while the secondary outcomes were the length of hospital stay, in-hospital morbidity, and mortality. The continuous variables were compared using the nonparametric Wilcoxon Rank sum (Mann-Whitney U) test while the categorical outcomes were compared using the chi-squared test in SPSS version 26. The protocol was retrospectively registered with the WHO Pan African Clinical Trial Registry (Number: PACTR202206468032528) on the 1st of June 2022. Of the 52 participants included in the analysis, the majority were males (80.8%) with a mean age of 34.23 (SD = 11.52) years. There was no statistically significant difference in the baseline characteristics of the study participants between the two groups (P > 0.05 for all). The median duration of postoperative ileus was 21.5 h less in the chewing gum group (28.5 versus 50.0, P = 0.002), while the length of hospital stay was 2.5 days less in the chewing gum group (5.4 versus 7.9, P = 0.007). There was no significant difference noted in the occurrence of complications. Chewing gum that is readily available and reasonably priced may help shorten the duration of post-operative ileus, which has the extra benefit of enabling early discharge."

    "abstract": "Recognition of lead-related complications after cardiac implantable electronic device implantation is challenging. An 86-year-old woman with a cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker (CRT-P) presented with recurrent nonspecific symptoms, including pulse-synchronous abdominal pain and dyspnea, over 3 emergency department visits. Right ventricular lead perforation went undiagnosed until significant hemothorax developed. A review of electrocardiographic (ECG) and chest X-ray images from earlier visits revealed that lead perforation could have been diagnosed earlier. This case underscores the diagnostic challenges of CIED complications, especially in patients with nonspecific symptoms. Key findings, such as ECG morphology changes and atypical lead position on X-ray, were missed because of limited knowledge of pacemaker-ECG interpretation and inattentional blindness. Lead perforation may occur several weeks after cardiac implantable electronic device implantation. In CRT patients, a predominantly positive stimulated QRS complex in lead V1 indicates possible loss of right ventricular capture as a possible sign of perforation."

An 81-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis and peripheral arterial disease (kissing iliac stents) presented for TAVR. Mild resistance was encountered when introducing the 14-F TAVR catheter through an 18-F sheath, but the catheter passed with gentle pressure. While the catheter was advancing up the aorta, a large, calcified mass was seen moving with the distal tip. Retraction of the catheter also retracted the seemingly attached calcific mass. Angiography revealed a catheter-induced avulsed atheroma but no perforation. The TAVR delivery catheter was carefully removed, and the calcific lesion settled infrarenally. Kissing iliac stenting was performed, raising the aortic bifurcation to the juxtarenal aorta and covering the mobile plaque. Angiography showed patent stents with excellent distal aortic and lower extremity runoff. Although rare, aortic complications can be devastating. Here, emergency multidisciplinary assistance was critical for a successful endovascular result."

However, CT systemic effects complicate surgical management, especially in emergency scenarios like acute abdomen. This study evaluates outcomes of emergency abdominal surgery in patients undergoing CT. A retrospective analysis was conducted at the Surgical Department of Cardinal Massaia Hospital, Italy, from January 2019 to June 2024. Patients aged ≥ 18 years undergoing emergency surgery for acute abdomen within 30 days of CT were included. Data on demographics, CT regimens, surgical and postoperative outcomes, and survival were analyzed using statistical software. Ethical approval was obtained. Thirty patients (15 males, 15 females; mean age 64.2 ± 10.3 years) were included. Indications for surgery included intestinal obstruction (80%), gastrointestinal perforation (13.3%), and colovesical fistula (6.7%). Peritoneal carcinomatosis was present in 66.7%, and R0 resection was achieved in only one case. Derivative colostomies were performed in 30% of cases. Postoperative complications occurred in 20%, but no re-operations or ICU admissions were required. The 30-day mortality rate was 6.7%. CT was resumed in 46.7% of patients, with median survival of 249 days for obstruction cases. Emergency surgery during CT is rare but feasible, with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates. Prompt resolution of acute conditions allows for CT resumption, improving overall survival. Multicenter studies are needed to validate these findings and establish standardized protocols."

    "abstract": "Acute abdominal pain is a prevalent complaint in pediatric emergency departments. Primary care physicians can find it challenging to treat such pain and, in particular, to determine whether it requires emergent surgical intervention. Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical cause of abdominal pain, but it is important to understand that other rare conditions can also be life-threatening. We report the case of a 6-year-old girl who presented to our pediatric emergency center with complaints of acute abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. She had no notable medical history, including perinatal, surgical, or psychiatric disorders. After finding a bezoar-like structure through a combined enteritis CT scan, reassessing the child's dietary concerns revealed that the child had experienced symptoms of trichophagia for approximately 3 to 4 years. Enterotomy and the removal of the bezoar were successfully performed. A pediatric psychiatric consultation was carried out to prevent further trichophagia-induced complications. Despite our patient's relatively young age and the failure to obtain a history of trichophagia at the onset, we successfully diagnosed a rare condition called Rapunzel syndrome. Although several cases of this condition have been reported by pediatric surgeons, we emphasize the role of physicians in pediatric emergency departments when examining children with this rare syndrome."

Here, we present a case of a 34-year-old male who came with complaints of abdominal pain and wound leak with history of recent previous surgeries. On exploratory laparotomy, a redundant segment of distal ileum and distal to an ileocolonic anastomosis was observed and was excised and sent for histopathological examination.

Consecutive patients hospitalized for non-operative treatment of acute complicated diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon between 2009 and 2015 were included in this retrospective analysis. Complicated disease was defined as the presence of extraluminal air or fluid collection within a computed tomography (CT) scan. The primary endpoint of the study was the need for emergent sigmoidectomy. The direction of perforation was assessed by CT scan and divided into 2 main groups: perforation towards the small bowel and perforation in other directions (abdominal wall, pelvic wall, retroperitoneum, urogenital organs). A total of 140 patients were included. Of these patients, 25 patients did not respond to non-operative treatment and underwent rescue surgery (18%). CT revealed perforations towards the small bowel in 28 patients, 19 of whom did not respond to non-operative treatment (68%); in contrast, 6 of 112 (5%) patients with perforation in other directions experienced treatment failure. By multivariate analysis, perforation towards the small bowel (hazard ratio 75.0; 95% CI, 13.7-409.7, p < 0.001) was associated with a significantly increased risk for a failure of non-operative management. The only other risk factor was the presence of an intra-abdominal abscess. Diverticular perforation towards the small bowel is associated with a very high risk for emergency sigmoidectomy due to failed non-operative treatment.

    "abstract": "Osteomyelitis is a bone infection that presents with swelling, erythema, pain, and possible systemic symptoms. Immunocompromised patients are at higher risk of developing osteomyelitis. Fungal pathogens are a rare etiology for these infections with very few case reports published compared to infections due to bacterial pathogens. Work up should include imaging studies to investigate infections when there is clinical suspicion for osteomyelitis. Bone biopsy is performed to identify the causative agent with bacterial infections being the most common. Osteomyelitis can be treated both surgically with debridement or amputation and medically with extended courses of antimicrobials or antifungals. Our case describes fungal foot osteomyelitis after an uncomplicated appendectomy. A 19-year-old previously healthy female underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for nonperforated, non-gangrenous appendicitis. Fourteen days later, she developed gradually worsening right foot pain, swelling, and erythema. After multiple failed treatments for the management of osteomyelitis, bone biopsies and courses of antibiotics, patient was ultimately diagnosed with a rare osteomyelitis secondary to Coccidioides species, which was managed and improved with antifungals. Bacterial osteomyelitis has been described in two English case reports as a postoperative complication of appendectomy, particularly when the appendicitis is perforated, gangrenous, or purulent. Fungal osteomyelitis is an even rarer cause of postoperative bone infection in immunocompetent patients. The goal for treatment is surgical intervention or pharmacologic management. Emergency department physicians should maintain a high suspicion for fungal osteomyelitis when otherwise healthy patients present multiple times for failing outpatient antibiotic regimens."

    "abstract": "While pinworm infections are common among children and adolescents, pinworms mimicking appendicitis are relatively rare. Notably, such manifestations may present in the absence of typical signs and symptoms of appendicitis. The appendix may even appear normal on a computed tomography (CT) scan and upon laparoscopic examination. The current case report aims to expand the literature on appendiceal pinworms while also showcasing the diagnostic challenge that such cases may represent. A 15-year-old female presented to the emergency department with acute onset of right lower quadrant abdominal pain and vomiting. Initial imaging studies, including CT of the abdomen and pelvis, revealed a normal-appearing appendix and gallbladder. Initial laboratory examinations revealed anemia; leukocytosis was notably absent. Despite the unremarkable findings, the severity of her pain continued to increase, leading to the decision to perform a diagnostic laparoscopy with appendectomy. The procedure was uncomplicated, and the removed appendix appeared grossly normal. However, histological examination of the appendix revealed intraluminal Enterobius vermicularis without transmural inflammation. Medical management of pinworm infestations is relatively simple. However, appendiceal pinworm infestations may not be diagnosed until surgical intervention has been employed. Case reports such as these offer insight into the diagnostic challenge that may be posed by appendiceal pinworms, emphasizing that high clinical suspicion may be needed to avoid unnecessary surgery."

However, concomitant perforation of dual anterior and posterior ulcerations (so-called 'kissing ulcers') is rare and presents significant surgical challenges with high morbidity and mortality. Such scenarios present surgical challenges and impose very high-level morbidity and mortality. A 76-year-old man described herein required emergency treatment for duodenal peptic ulcer perforation. Overall, three operations took place in response to a single anterior peptic ulcer of duodenum that culminated in anterior/posterior kissing ulcers. Pancreas-sparing duodenectomy was performed as a final attempt, along with radiographic localisation of the papilla. This rare instance of duodenal peptic ulceration underscores the feasibility and importance of a more definitive approach after ineffective initial surgical intervention."

    "abstract": "Aim This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of subcutaneous negative suction drainage vs. no drainage in reducing postoperative complications following emergency laparotomy for peritonitis. Objective The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of subcutaneous negative pressure closure on various postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing emergency surgery. Specifically, the study aims to assess its impact on the incidence of surgical site infection (SSI), wound dehiscence, the need for secondary suturing, and the duration of hospital stay. Additionally, the study seeks to determine whether the observed SSIs are primarily attributable to intra-abdominal infections or are a result of hospital-acquired cross infections. Materials and methods A prospective comparative study was conducted on 60 patients diagnosed with peritonitis who underwent emergency laparotomy. They were randomly assigned into two groups of 30 patients each: Group A (with subcutaneous negative suction drain) and Group B (without drain). In Group A, drain fluid was analyzed for infection characteristics, while wound discharge from both groups was assessed microbiologically, where present. Results Group A included 21 males (70%) and nine females (30%), while Group B had 26 males (86%) and four females (13%). Midline vertical incisions were used in 90% of cases, with the remaining 10% receiving right paramedian incisions. Discharge from the incision site was observed in five patients (16%) in Group A and 13 patients (43%) in Group B (p = 0.024). SSIs occurred in five patients (16.67%) in Group A and in eight patients (26%) in Group B. Seroma formation was observed in five patients (16.67%) in Group B, but none in Group A. No significant differences were noted in wound dehiscence, need for secondary suturing, or duration of hospital stay between the groups. Conclusion Subcutaneous negative suction drainage significantly reduced the incidence of SSI, seroma formation, and discharge from the incision site following emergency laparotomy for peritonitis. This may lower the risk of wound complications and postoperative morbidity. Further randomized controlled trials are recommended to validate these findings."

    "abstract": "Secondary peritonitis is a serious condition with significant morbidity and mortality. Its management requires emergency laparotomy for source control. Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) and primary abdominal closure (PAC) are the main strategies for managing the laparostomy after source control. Despite the increasing use of VAC, concerns persist regarding its complications and long-term outcomes compared with PAC. This systematic review followed PRISMA 2020 and MOOSE. The Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB 2) tool, MINORS and GRADE framework assessed study quality and evidence certainty. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022304724). A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from January 2004 to August 2024 identified studies reporting postoperative outcomes following VAC or PAC after laparotomy for secondary peritonitis. The included studies had to report at least two key outcomes: mortality, postoperative complications, incisional hernia, secondary fascial closure, and hospital or intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay. Thirty-three studies including 4,520 patients were analyzed. Mortality was 31.1% in VAC and 22.2% in PAC (p = 0.327). Postoperative complications were higher with VAC (71.0% vs. 39.3%, p = 0.001). Incisional hernia rates were similar (21.3% vs. 20.8%, p = 0.958). Secondary fascial closure rate was significantly lower with VAC (58.1% vs. 85.9%, p < 0.001). VAC patients had longer ICU stays (21.1 vs. 9.7 days, p = 0.04), while hospital stay did not differ. Most studies had a high risk of bias, and GRADE assessment showed low to very low evidence certainty. VAC therapy was associated with more postoperative complications, a lower fascial closure rate, and a longer ICU length of stay compared with PAC. Thirty-day mortality rates did not differ between the approaches. However, most of studies included were subject to serious risk of bias and a low level of certainty in evidence."

Data reviewed included patient demographics, hospital resources and location. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used for statistical analysis. We identified 24,088 patients, of which 8768 (36.4%) were female, with a mean age of 10 years. 9690 (40.2%) of patients were white and 14.398 (59.8%) were non-white (including brown, black, asian or indigenous). Geographically, more patients were from the Southeast region. 21,627 (89.8%) of cases were open appendectomies. On univariable analysis, factors significantly influencing the selection of laparoscopic appendectomy included being female, white race, and higher socioeconomic status. The severity of appendicitis did not significantly affect the surgical approach. On multivariable analysis, white race (OR 1.934, [1.759, 2.126]), advanced hospital facilities (OR 5.987, [5.395, 6.644]), and hospitals located in the wealthier Southern region (OR 4.277, [3.884, 4.710]) were significant predictors of a laparoscopic approach. The surgical approach for pediatric appendectomy in Brazil was determined by social determinants rather than by disease severity.

With occurrence in <5 % of all gastrointestinal tract tumors, they encompass 60 % of all gastric stromal tumors. A 60-year-old man presented to the emergency department with pain abdomen and lump for the past 4 months. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) abdomen showed a large (largest dimension-25 cm), well-defined, soft tissue lesion on left side of abdominal cavity, crossing the midline to the right side. En-bloc tumor resection with wedge resection of the gastric body was performed. On histopathological examination, definitive diagnosis of giant gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) was established. Postoperatively, the patient received adjuvant oral Imatinib therapy, and is recurrence free at 3-years of follow-up. The clinical manifestations of GIST are non-specific and vary from being asymptomatic to several signs and symptoms such as abdominal pain, a palpable mass, bleeding, intestinal occlusion, and perforation. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for GISTs, and neoadjuvant imatinib mesylate therapy for locally advanced GISTs confers good prognosis. Despite the fact that luminal bleeding is the most common presentation, sometimes the tumor may grow exophytically without any symptoms. If large enough as observed in the present case, they may present to emergency department as intra-tumoral bleed. Surgical resection and neoadjuvant therapy with imatinib is equally advantageous even for giant GIST. Diagnosis and therapeutical protocol of GISTs should be established by a trans-disciplinary team."

Our institutional rate of CT utilization for suspected appendicitis was higher than in peer children's hospitals, so we aimed to reduce CT utilization during the evaluation of pediatric appendicitis from 31.3% to 15% within 12 months. From September 2021 to October 2022, we conducted a multidisciplinary quality improvement initiative among patients evaluated for appendicitis in the pediatric emergency department (PED). Interventions included standardizing evaluation with a clinical practice guideline, an order set in the electronic medical record for clinical decision support, and radiologist use of an ultrasound report template. The primary measure was the percentage of patients undergoing evaluation for appendicitis who received an abdominal CT scan. Process measures were the timing of surgical consultation and ultrasound report template use. Balancing measures included negative pathology appendectomies and PED return visits within 72 hours with subsequent appendicitis diagnosis. We analyzed data using statistical process control charts and Nelson rules to detect special cause variation. We evaluated a total of 2,010 patients for acute appendicitis, with 624 representing baseline encounters with a CT rate of 31.3%. Quality improvement interventions reduced the CT rate to 12.1% sustained for 10 months without impacting the rate of negative pathology appendectomy or PED return visits within 72 hours.

These outcomes were compared for cases with new COVID-19 infection and emergency cases with difficulties in transport to hospital. Months were considered to have significantly high or low mortality or complication rates, if the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the standardized mortality (morbidity) ratio (SMR) did not contain 1. Postoperative 30-day mortality occurred in 1826 cases (10.3%), surgical mortality in 2382 cases (13.4%), and postoperative complications in 5276 cases (29.7%). Significantly higher SMRs were found for 30-day mortality in November 2020 (1.44 [95% CI: 1.07-1.89]) and February 2021 (1.54 [95% CI: 1.14-2.03]), and for postoperative complications in June 2020 (1.27 [95% CI: 1.07-1.50]). In 2022, there were marked increases in new COVID-19 cases and in emergency cases with difficulties in transport to hospital, but no month had a significantly high SMR. Emergency cases with difficulties in transport markedly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic but had little effect on short-term outcomes of colorectal perforation."

    "title": "Delirium after emergency surgery in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation: a retrospective cohort study for 5 years.",
    "abstract": "Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication after major surgery, particularly in patients who underwent emergency gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction or perforation surgery. This study aimed to retrospectively assess the incidence and risk factors of POD in this cohort. This study included 583 patients who were diagnosed with GI obstruction or perforation and underwent emergency surgery. POD was diagnosed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, criteria or evaluated using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit. The risk factors for delirium were analyzed using univariate and multivariate methods. Overall, 106 patients (18.2%) developed delirium within the first 7 days after surgery. The analysis revealed the following independent risk factors: age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.097 [95% CI, 1.065-1.131; P <.001), coronary heart disease (aOR, 3.125 [95% CI, 1.485-6.577; P =.003), hypoproteinemia (aOR, 16.782 [95% CI, 5.484-51.355]; P <.001), septic shock (aOR, 8.565 [95% CI, 4.140-17.721]; P <.001), and intraoperative hypotension (aOR, 4.223 [95% CI, 1.901-9.382]; P <.001). Low-dose dexamethasone (aOR, 0.414 [95% CI, 0.217-0.787]; P =.007) was confirmed as an independent protective factor for POD. The delirium group experienced a significantly longer hospitalization duration, higher 7-day mortality, and increased in-hospital mortality. Our study identified several high-risk factors for POD in patients with acute GI obstruction or perforation conditions. Low-dose dexamethasone may be an independent protective factor."

    "title": "Ischemia-Modified Albumin and Oxidative Stress Marker in Acute Appendicitis: A Prospective Study.",
    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency in childhood and adulthood. However, perforated appendicitis is a condition that requires early diagnosis and treatment due to the increased risk of complications. In our study, we aimed to evaluate the clinical values of various biochemical, hematological, and inflammatory parameters in order to distinguish acute appendicitis from perforated appendicitis. A total of 87 participants aged 18-65 y were enrolled in this prospective study. 29 patients with acute appendicitis, 29 patients with perforated appendicitis, and 29 healthy controls were included. Serum urea, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein concentrations were measured using an automated analyser, and whole blood parameters were measured using a haematological analyser. Total antioxidant status, total oxidant status, total thiol (TT), and native thiol (NT) levels were measured photometrically. Oxidative stress index and disulfide (DIS) level were calculated mathematically. Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) levels were measured photometrically using commercially purchased kits. The elevated levels of urea, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, white blood cell, and platelet count in the acute and perforated appendicitis groups compared to controls, significantly (P < 0.001). Oxidative stress markers (total oxidant status, oxidative stress index, DIS, DIS/TT, DIS/NT, and IMA) were higher, while antioxidant markers (total antioxidant status, TT, NT, and NT/TT) were lower in the appendicitis groups (P < 0.001). Additionally, inflammatory markers IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α were elevated, particularly in the perforated appendicitis group (P < 0.05). IMA is a promising biomarker for distinguishing perforated appendicitis from acute appendicitis. Its role, in conjunction with other oxidative stress and inflammatory markers, may enhance diagnostic precision and aid clinicians in timely intervention, potentially reducing complications associated with delayed or missed diagnoses. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings."

    "abstract": "Introduction Laparoscopic Appendectomy (LA) allows residents to get early exposure to minimally invasive techniques. Despite its importance, involving residents as primary surgeons is a complex process, influenced by more than just clinical factors. Mentorship, environment, and perceptions play crucial roles. This study aimed to explore rates of residents' involvement in LA, the factors influencing the decision-making, and how surgeons and residents perceive the process. Methods We analyzed data from the REsiDENT-1 trial, covering 653 LA performed between 2019 and 2023 in 24 hospitals affiliated with the University of Milan. Adults with intraoperative acute appendicitis were included. Univariable analysis and multivariable logistic regression explored factors impacting residents' involvement and clinical outcomes. A survey captured the perspectives of surgeons and residents. Results Residents approached 35.9% of the procedures, with longer operative times 67.14 (± 28.1) vs 71.68 (± 24.44), p = 0.001. Trainees were more involved in academic hospitals and emergency surgery units and less complex cases with lower complication rates. Residents' involvement was hampered by patients' complexity in the multivariable analysis. Surgeons prioritized non-technical factors such as punctuality and reliability, whereas residents highlighted clinical complexity as a key consideration for the decision-making of the operator. Both groups agreed that structured feedback systems could improve the educational and training experiences. Conclusion LA remains a crucial procedure for surgical training, balancing hands-on learning with patient safety. Structured mentorship in academic and emergency settings could allow safe resident involvement. Future improvements should focus on clear feedback processes, better access to simulations, and standardized competency-based training to prepare residents for independent practice."

    "abstract": "COVID-19 can affect multiple organ systems beyond the respiratory tract, including the gastrointestinal tract, where gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and even serious manifestations such as ulcers, perforation, or gastrointestinal bleeding. We report a case of a 45-year-old male patient with small bowel ulcers caused by chronic COVID-19 infection. Initially presenting with fever and transient unconsciousness, he developed ischemic necrosis and required a mid-thigh amputation. Despite treatment with anti-infection therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and continuous renal replacement therapy, he experienced persistent abdominal pain and gastrointestinal bleeding. Imaging and colonoscopy confirmed partial small bowel obstruction and inflammation. After treatment with methylprednisolone and enteral nutrition, his symptoms improved. However, he suffered a gastrointestinal perforation requiring emergency surgery and later underwent a successful stoma reversal. The patient was subsequently discharged with improvement and was discharged with a primary diagnosis of \"enterostomal status, perforation of small intestinal ulcer, viral myocarditis, COVID-19 infection, and post right lower extremity amputation\". During the past year of follow-up, the patient has not experienced any recurrence of abdominal pain or rectal bleeding. Although coronavirus pneumonia combined with small bowel ulcers is rare, it requires emergency treatment and has a high mortality rate. This case highlighted the severe gastrointestinal complications induced by COVID-19 infection and the effectiveness of comprehensive management strategies."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is caused by a blockage of the appendix, leading to the proliferation of intestinal bacteria and subsequent inflammation of the appendix. Within the scope of pediatrics, appendicitis is associated with an atypical presentation, and its symptoms can overlap with other abdominal conditions, contributing to a higher risk of misdiagnosis. Despite its relatively low prevalence in patients less than four years of age, appendicitis remains a critical condition that requires prompt recognition and intervention to avoid complications and ensure favorable outcomes. We present a case of perforated appendicitis in a 23-month-old female patient who presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain. This report highlights the challenges in diagnosing appendicitis in this age group and reviews current guidelines for the evaluation of suspected appendicitis in young children. Emphasis is placed on the importance of timely diagnosis and surgical intervention to reduce complications and prevent mortality."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a prevalent abdominal emergency, with appendectomy and antibiotic therapy being the conventional mainstays of treatment. Recently, endoscopic retrograde appendicitis therapy (ERAT) has emerged as a promising minimally invasive alternative. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of ERAT in the management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis. A systematic review of the literature was performed by searching the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases, covering records from inception to January 2025. Meta-analyses were conducted using Review Manager 5.4, employing a random-effects model when applicable. A total of 8 studies were included, consisting of three randomized controlled trials and five retrospective studies, with a combined sample size of 2005 participants. When compared with the laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) group, the ERAT group demonstrated a significantly lower treatment success rate (odds ratio [OR] 0.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04-0.57, P = 0.005) and a significantly higher recurrence rate (OR 7.68, 95% CI 2.32-25.46, P = 0.0009). In contrast, compared with the antibiotic therapy group, the ERAT group exhibited a higher treatment success rate (OR 2.10, 95% CI 0.95-4.64, P = 0.07) and a lower recurrence rate (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.09-1.07, P = 0.06), although these differences did not reach statistical significance. Additionally, the overall incidence of adverse events associated with ERAT was significantly lower than that observed with antibiotic therapy (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.02-0.50, P = 0.005). ERAT is a promising but not yet definitive alternative for uncomplicated acute appendicitis, with advantages in organ preservation and fewer adverse events compared to antibiotics. However, relatively low success rate and high recurrence rate of ERAT currently prevent it from completely replacing appendectomy. Further high-quality studies are needed to better define its role in clinical practice."

A 78-year-old female presented with a 5-day history of worsening non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms. Her admission CT study initially reported a large adnexal mass lesion causing obstruction of neighbouring small bowel loops. Management was initiated under the presumption of a complex uterine fibroid causing local small bowel obstruction. Only a secondary radiological review-conducted due to persistent abdominal pain-identified the characteristic \"whirlpool\" sign of the uterine cavity and prompted the differential of uterine torsion. Contrast-enhanced MRI study further confirmed this suggestion with a lack of uterine contrast uptake and the \"X-sign.\" The patient subsequently had an emergency laparotomy for a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Intra-operative findings and further histological analysis demonstrated a distorted uterine cavity with haemorrhagic infarction, confirming a diagnosis of uterine torsion."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to compare preoperative, intraoperative, and tumor characteristics between patients undergoing emergency and elective surgery for right-sided colon cancer. Despite the worsened prognosis of emergency colorectal cancer cases, studies on right colon cancer remain limited. This retrospective study included 356 patients who underwent surgery for right-sided colon cancer between January 2015 and April 2023. Patients were categorized into emergency (n=93) and elective (n=263) groups. Demographic data, tumor characteristics, and surgical details were analyzed. Binary logistic regression was applied to identify independent predictors of emergency surgery. Age (p=0.435) and gender distribution (p=0.853) were similar between groups. However, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores were higher in the emergency group (p=0.001), while Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) scores showed no significant difference (p=0.169). T4 (p<0.001), N1 (p=0.008), and M1 stages (p<0.001) were significantly more frequent in the emergency group, along with higher tumor perforation rates (34.4% vs. 1.9%, p<0.001). Open surgery was more common in the emergency group (p=0.005). While total lymph node yield was similar (p=0.501), the number of metastatic lymph nodes was higher in the emergency group (p=0.008). Logistic regression identified higher ASA score, advanced T, N, M stages, tumor perforation, and tumor size as predictors of emergency surgery. Patients undergoing emergency surgery for right colon cancer have more advanced disease, higher tumor perforation rates, and poorer prognostic factors. Laparoscopic surgery was less utilized, which indicates technical challenges. Early diagnosis and screening strategies may reduce emergency interventions and improve outcomes."

    "title": "Facing Complexity: Outcomes of Surgical Bailouts from Complications of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in a Single High-Volume Center.",
    "abstract": "Background: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is at the forefront of structural heart programs all over the world. With a growing number of TAVR procedures in lower-risk and younger patients, acute and chronic complications require decisive treatment. The aim of the present study is to retrospectively analyze the efficacy of surgical bailout strategies in case of complications from TAVR that had been performed in the highest-volume center in Italy over the past ten years. Methods: Acute complications were defined as events occurring in the first 24 h after surgery, while chronic complications were defined as events occurring within the first year post-implant. We retrospectively analyzed the 2731 patients who had undergone TAVR at our institution from January 2015 to August 2024. Results: A total of 21 patients were included, with a median age of 78 years (IQR 11y). The majority of patients underwent TAVR with a self-expanding prosthesis (76%). A total of 11 patients (52%) presented acute complications, of which the most common were aortic dissection (n = 4 [19%]) followed by left ventricular perforation (n = 3 [14%]). The most common chronic complication was early endocarditis (n = 5 [24%]). The most common bailout strategy was aortic valve replacement (AVR), which was sufficient in 10 patients (48%), followed by complete root replacement (n = 4 [19%]). In-hospital mortality was higher in acute compared with chronic complications albeit not statistically significant (n = 4 [36%] vs. n = 2 [20%], p = 0.64), highlighting the very high risk of all these surgeries. Conclusions: Bailout and post-TAVR surgery are critical issues, with overall acceptable yet significant mortality considering the very high risk of these procedures. In our experience, half of the overall complications cannot be resolved with a simple explant and subsequent valve replacement, thereby underlining the importance of skilled cardiothoracic surgery teams on site to address complex issues such as ventricular perforation and emergency aortic/root replacement."

    "title": "The Many Faces of Intestinal Tumors in Adults, Including the Primary Role of CT Imaging in Emergencies and the Important Role of Cross-Sectional Imaging: A Pictorial Review.",
    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Small bowel tumors (SBTs) encompass a diverse range of tumor types, with benign tumors being the most prevalent. However, the incidence of malignant SBTs is increasing, particularly small bowel adenocarcinoma; this poses a diagnostic challenge for clinicians and radiologists due to the varied and nonspecific clinical and radiological presentations associated with SBTs. In fact, SBTs can present differently in emergencies, often mimicking inflammatory diseases or manifesting as complications such as intussusception, small bowel obstruction (SBO), intestinal ischemia, perforation, gastrointestinal bleeding, or metastatic disease. These tumors can remain asymptomatic for extended periods. Methods: We present a pictorial review on the role of imaging in evaluating SBTs, focusing on the emergency setting where diagnosis can be incidental. We also include some representative cases that may be useful for radiologists and residents in clinical practice. Results: Despite these challenges, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is usually the best modality to use in emergencies for evaluating SBTs, and in some cases, a diagnosis can be made incidentally. However, when possible, multimodal imaging through cross-sectional imaging remains crucial for the non-invasive diagnosis of SBTs in stable patients, as endoscopic procedures may also be impractical. A complementary CT study with distension using negative oral contrast media, such as water, polyethylene glycol, or mannitol solutions, can improve the characterization of SBTs and rule out multiple SBT locations, particularly in small bowel neuroendocrine tumor (NET) and gastrointestinal tumor (GIST) localization. Positive water-soluble iodine-based oral contrast, such as Gastrografin (GGF), can be used to evaluate and monitor the intestinal lumen during the nonsurgical management of small bowel obstruction (SBO) or in suspected cases of small bowel perforations or the presence of fistulas. Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) can aid in improving the characterization of SBTs through a multiplanar and multisequence study. Positron emission tomography combined with CT is generally an essential modality in evaluating metastatic disease and staging and assessing tumor prognosis, but it has limitations for indolent lymphoma and small NETs. Conclusions: Therefore, the integration of multiple imaging modalities can improve patient management and provide a preoperative risk assessment with prognostic and predictive indicators. In the future, radiomics could potentially serve as a \"virtual biopsy\" for SBTs, allowing for better diagnosis and more personalized management in precision medicine."

    "abstract": "The surge in migration from the Middle East and North Africa due to conflicts has significantly impacted healthcare systems, particularly in Greece. This study investigates how the sharp increase in refugees and migrants after July 2015 has strained the surgical departments of the Greek National Health System (NHS). A retrospective analysis was conducted on 229 patients treated at the emergency department of a public hospital in Athens, Greece. Data were compared between two periods: January 2012-July 2015 (pre-July 2015) and July 2015-December 2018 (post-July 2015), with July 2015 chosen as the cutoff due to a significant influx of immigrants during that time. Patients' demographic details, diagnoses, and surgical interventions were analyzed. Results indicated a significant rise in surgical cases, with 72.5% of patients requiring procedures, notably for appendicitis (23.6%), cholecystitis (10.9%), lower extremity thrombophlebitis (9.6%), perianal abscess (8.3%), and inguinal hernia (5.7%). Post-July 2015, there was a notable increase in perianal abscess (12.2%), inguinal hernia (8.4%), and cholelithiasis (6.1%). However, the average hospital stay of 3.9 days remained unchanged. The findings reveal the profound economic and operational pressures on the NHS during the refugee crisis, highlighting the urgent need for resource optimization and policy reforms. Future studies should address long-term healthcare impacts to support more sustainable healthcare models amidst ongoing and future migration challenges."

    "abstract": "A 30s-year-old male complaining of abdominal distension and pain was referred to our hospital. The support by palliative care team was initiated soon after emergency admission. Colonoscopic examination revealed a circumferential ulcerated tumor of rectosigmoid and the tumor was diagnosed as an adenocarcinoma. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed multiple enlarged lymph nodes, diffuse peritoneal nodules and massive ascites, which led us to the diagnosis of advanced rectosigmoid cancer. Because bowel obstruction was not observed, early initiation of systemic therapy was planned. Although abdominal pain was alleviated with analgesics including opioids, discomfort from abdominal distension remained. So, we decided to perform cell-free and concentrated ascites reinfusion therapy(CART). To avoid the delay in the initiation of systemic chemotherapy due the adverse effects of CART, the first systemic chemotherapy was followed by CART. After single CART, the abdominal distention resolved without relapse, and seamless transition to outpatient treatment was made. Although the prognosis of colorectal cancer with diffuse peritoneal dissemination is poor, aggressive adoption of palliative therapy including CART may enable the introduction of systemic chemotherapy and the following alleviation of cancer-related symptoms."

    "abstract": "There is compelling evidence supporting the omission of routine group and save (G&S) testing pre-operatively in emergency laparoscopy where appendicitis is suspected. Most studies are retrospective; however, one study prospectively demonstrated safe application in laparoscopic cholecystectomies only. We sought to assess safety, cost, and environmental and social savings-the triple bottom line-of omitting routine G&S testing in laparoscopic appendicectomies, by undertaking a quality improvement project at a busy district general hospital. All patients who underwent an emergency laparoscopy +/- appendicectomy, between 1 November 2020 and 31 October 2021, were retrospectively reviewed, and cross-referenced to haematological testing and blood product dispensation data. A cost of £15 was applied to processed G&S samples and £1.89 to rejected samples. A carbon cost of 1,066 g CO2 emissions (CO2 e) was applied to all samples. We then prospectively undertook a 6-month pilot intervention to omit routine G&S testing in these cases. Patients from either cohort who required blood transfusions underwent a deep dive to identify risk factors. Pre-intervention, 281/392 (71.7%) of patients had valid G&S samples prior to their procedure and no patient required blood products during their episode. Post-intervention, 56/189 (29.1%) patients had valid G&S samples. One patient with chronic anaemia required a preoperative blood transfusion. Pre-intervention, G&S testing cost £22.24 and 1.7 kg CO2 e per laparoscopy. Post-intervention, the cost reduced to £9.78 and 0.7 kg CO2 e per laparoscopy. The intervention saved £5,021 and 353 kg CO2 e, and our institution has adopted a selective approach, based on clinical risk, for these cases indefinitely. Routine G&S testing in emergency laparoscopy +/- appendicectomy is unnecessary, costing money and time and producing carbon emissions. With effective communication of risk-mitigating factors, practice can shift from high to low rates of preoperative testing. There are further savings accessible by applying this method to other surgical procedures using a risk-based approach."

    "abstract": "Splenic abscess is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition that can rupture, leading to pneumoperitoneum and symptoms that mimic gastrointestinal perforation in rare cases. This can significantly complicate accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment. A splenic abscess can become life-threatening by rupturing, which may cause diffuse peritonitis or sepsis. A 68-year-old man with uncontrolled diabetes presented with fever, chills, and abdominal pain. Initial evaluation at a previous hospital, including computed tomography (CT), suggested a lower gastrointestinal perforation, leading to his transfer to our facility. CT revealed a non-enhancing lesion with gas in the spleen and free intraperitoneal air; however, there was no clear evidence of gastrointestinal perforation. An emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed, which revealed purulent ascites and a ruptured splenic abscess without any gastrointestinal perforation. After thorough lavage to eliminate contamination, open abdominal management was initiated owing to a need for catecholamine support and an inability to completely rule out the possibility of gastrointestinal perforation. A second-look laparotomy confirmed that there was no further contamination or gastrointestinal tract perforation. Blood and abscess cultures revealed Escherichia coli, leading us to initiate targeted antibiotic therapy. The patient recovered successfully and was discharged on postoperative day 40 without any recurrence. Ruptured splenic abscess with pneumoperitoneum is rare and poses significant diagnostic challenges, particularly in patients with diabetes, owing to its clinical similarity to gastrointestinal perforation. This study highlights the utility of exploratory laparotomy and staged open abdominal management when gastrointestinal perforation cannot be ruled out. Physicians should consider ruptured splenic abscesses in patients with pneumoperitoneum, particularly those with diabetes. Exploratory laparotomy with staged open abdominal management may represent an effective approach that facilitates safe monitoring and targeted treatment, thereby reducing the risk of fatal complications."

    "abstract": "Appendectomy is the most frequent emergency abdominal operation in children, who regularly present with complicated acute appendicitis and thus need targeted antibiotic therapy. While in other fields antibiotic stewardship (ABS) is becoming increasingly well established, these principles are not consistently followed in pediatric surgery. With this study, we aimed to analyze the effects of the implementation of an ABS-compliant SOP on the postoperative care of patients. We compared the quality of antibiotic therapy before and after the implementation of standard operating procedure (SOP) for the peri-/postoperative antibiotic treatment of appendicitis in 2020. Pediatric patients who had undergone appendectomy were evaluated based on an algorithm presenting recommended antibiotic therapy of appendicitis, according to the current literature and good clinical practice. 165 patients were evaluated before and 209 patients after the implementation of SOP. The mean number of cases in which antibiotic therapy was given postoperatively was 10.5% lower (p-value 0.036) and the median quality-of-treatment score increased by 31.2% (p<0.0001) after the implementation of the SOP. The median length of antibiotic treatment in cases of advanced-stage appendicitis was 2.0 days shorter (p=0.062). The rate of oral antibiotic treatment after discharge decreased by 25.6% (p<0.0001). We observed no significant effects on the median length of hospital stay or the complication rate. The implementation of SOP based on the principles of ABS positively influenced the quality of treatment after pediatric appendectomy. The algorithm developed in this study may help pediatric surgeons to improve their antimicrobial assessment. Die Entfernung des Wurmfortsatzes ist die häufigste abdominelle Notfalloperation bei Kindern, die verhältnismäßig oft mit einer fortgeschrittenen Appendizitis vorstellig werden und daher eine zielgerichtete antibiotische Therapie benötigen. Während in anderen medizinischen Fachbereichen die Prinzipien des Antibiotic Stewardship (ABS) zunehmend etabliert sind, werden diese in der Kinderchirurgie immer noch nicht konsequent berücksichtigt. Ziel dieser Studie war es daher, die Auswirkungen der Implementierung einer ABS-konformen SOP auf die postoperative Versorgung dieser Patientengruppe zu untersuchen. Wir verglichen die Qualität der peri- und postoperativen Antibiotikatherapie vor und nach der Implementierung einer Standardarbeitsanweisung (SOP) im Jahr 2020. Die Versorgung pädiatrischer Patienten, bei denen eine Appendektomie durchgeführt wurde, wurde anhand eines Algorithmus bewertet, der aus unserer Sicht die empfohlene Antibiotikatherapie gemäß aktueller Literatur und guter klinischer Praxis darstellt. Insgesamt wurden 165 Patientenfälle vor und 209 Patienten nach Einführung der SOP ausgewertet. Nach Einführung der SOP wurde in durchschnittlich 10,5% weniger Fällen eine postoperative antibiotische Therapie initiiert (p-Wert 0,036). Die nach dem in diesem Rahmen entwickelten Score evaluierte Qualität der Behandlung verbesserte sich um 31,2% (p<0,0001). Die mediane Dauer der Antibiotikabehandlung bei fortgeschrittener Appendizitis war 2,0 Tage kürzer (p=0,062). Der Anteil der fortgeführten oralen Antibiotikabehandlung nach Entlassung sank um 25,6% (p<0,0001). Dabei wurde kein signifikanter Effekt auf die mediane Krankenhausverweildauer oder die Komplikationsrate beobachtet. Die Implementierung einer auf den Prinzipien des ABS basierenden SOP hatte einen positiven Einfluss auf die Behandlungsqualität nach Appendektomie im Kindesalter. Der für diese Studie entwickelte Behandlungsalgorithmus kann zukünftigen Kinderchirurgen als Entscheidungshilfe für die Wahl der korrekten antimikrobiellen Therapie bei Appendizitis dienen."

    "abstract": "Perforated duodenal ulcers post Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) are rare, with fewer than 30 documented cases. Diagnosis can be challenging due to the absence of pneumoperitoneum on cross-sectional imaging, seen in only five published cases.  A 67-year-old female patient, 24 years post RYGB, presented with diffuse abdominal pain, fever, hypotension, and tachycardia following recent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) use. Laboratory findings showed leukopenia and elevated lipase. Computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed pneumoperitoneum, prompting emergent exploratory laparotomy. A 0.5 cm duodenal perforation was identified and repaired with omental plication. Postoperatively, the patient developed bacteremia and intra-abdominal abscess requiring prolonged antibiotics and percutaneous drainage. Empiric Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) treatment and lifelong proton pump inhibitors (PPI) were initiated. No standard treatment exists for post-RYGB duodenal perforation, though omental patch plication is commonly performed. Some advocate for complete gastrectomy to prevent ulcer formation; however, risks of doing so include dysmotility, bacterial overgrowth, and recurrent ulceration. Theories regarding the etiology of these ulcers include persistent acid production in the remnant stomach, H. pylori infection, and potential NSAID-related effects. Lifelong PPI use, clinical monitoring for recurrent ulcers, and early endoscopy in symptomatic patients constitute long-term patient management. While routine surveillance endoscopy is not standard, it may be considered in high-risk patients such as those with poor nutrition, ulceration while on PPI, or current smokers."

    "abstract": "COVID-19 infection can cause bowel ischemia, with an incidence ranging from 0.22% to 10.5. The COVID-19 vaccine reduces respiratory symptoms and the need for cardiopulmonary support. However, its effects on other manifestations, such as bowel ischemia, have not been extensively studied. Despite having mild respiratory symptoms and receiving three doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, our patient developed ischemic colitis after her first infection and small bowel ischemia following her second infection. An 86-year-old woman presented to the emergency department (ED) with abdominal pain after a mild COVID-19 infection. She was admitted with ischemic colitis, but conservative treatment failed. In the operating room, her entire colon was found to be ischemic, necessitating a total colectomy with end ileostomy. Nine months later, she returned to the ED with mild respiratory symptoms and severe right upper quadrant pain. Imaging revealed pneumoperitoneum and a mid-abdominal abscess. An emergency laparotomy revealed small bowel perforation, with final histology confirming ischemia. The patient had received three doses of the COVID-19 vaccine and was on therapeutic anticoagulation for a history of pulmonary embolism. COVID-19 may increase the risk of bowel and colon ischemia even after vaccination. Patients presenting to the ED with severe abdominal pain and a recent COVID-19 infection should be carefully evaluated for ischemic events."

    "abstract": "Wandering spleen (WS) is a rare circumstance characterized via exaggerated splenic mobility because of absent or lax suspensory ligaments. It predisposes the spleen to torsion, that could purpose infarction, rupture, or gangrene, requiring urgent intervention. We report a 10-year-old girl with a three-day history of acute abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever. Physical examination revealed diffuse tenderness, predominantly in the right lower quadrant (RLQ), mimicking appendicitis. Ultrasound and CT showed WS with torsion, showing the characteristic whirl sign. Emergency laparotomy revealed a 720-diploma splenic torsion with necrosis, necessitating splenectomy. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on postoperative day five. WS is an extraordinary entity (<0.2 % occurrence) with a bimodal age distribution, often affecting adolescents and girls. It can be congenital or acquired and presents variably, from asymptomatic cases to acute abdomen. Torsion leads to vascular compromise, requiring prompt surgical intervention. This case was very interesting to the surgical team for its atypical presentation and its resemblance to perforated appendicitis. WS must be considered in cases of acute abdomen with an absent spleen on imaging. Early recognition and surgical intervention are essential to prevent complications in patients with acute abdomen. Ultrasound and CT are critical for early detection and differentiation from different abdomen emergencies."

    "abstract": "Ileal strangulation is a rare condition that leads to upper intestinal obstruction. It is difficult to diagnose preoperatively and requires urgent medical and surgical management. We report the management of a case of appendicular knot on the ileum. A 52-year-old patient was seen for an occlusive syndrome evolving in a febrile context, with a biological inflammatory syndrome. The diagnosis was mesocoeliac appendicitis. Imaging was not performed due to lack of access. Laparotomy revealed the necrotic ileal loop, strangulated by an inflammatory appendix. An ileo-caecal resection with terminal ascending ileo-colic anastomosis and cleaning of the peritoneal cavity were performed. Postoperative management was straightforward. Strangulation of the terminal ileum by the appendix is a rare entity causing upper intestinal obstruction by strangulation. We report the 5th case in the literature from sub-Harienne Africa. The etiopathogenesis of this condition is believed to be appendicular length and inflammation. The pathophysiology describes 04 mechanisms, depending on the topography of the appendix. Surgical management is not codified, and depends on intraoperative findings. Appendiceal strangulation of the ileum is a serious condition requiring complex preoperative diagnosis. It is a medical and surgical emergency requiring rapid management."

    "abstract": "Body packing, a method used to traffic illicit drugs, primarily involves the gastrointestinal tract as a concealment route. Commonly trafficked substances include cocaine, heroin, marijuana, methamphetamine, and cannabis, often sealed in handmade latex packets characterized by specific imaging signs. Prompt diagnosis is crucial for initiating appropriate treatment, recognizing complications, and ensuring proper medico-legal handling. Abdominal radiographs are the preferred initial imaging modality due to their low cost and widespread availability, though their sensitivity varies depending on packet size, location, and interpreter expertise. Abdominopelvic non-contrast CT is the gold standard for detecting gastrointestinal packages, offering high sensitivity and specificity. Low-dose CT protocols are recommended to minimize radiation exposure without compromising diagnostic accuracy, particularly for follow-up or in cases without complications. Contrast-enhanced CT is reserved for assessing suspected complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation. This pictorial review highlights key imaging findings correlated with clinical features, aiming to facilitate accurate recognition, timely intervention, and prevention of complications in suspected cases."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency. While clinical diagnosis is generally effective, it is not perfect, potentially leading to negative appendectomies or delayed treatment. This study investigated the histopathological patterns of appendectomy specimens in King Khalid Hospital, Hail Province, Saudi Arabia, correlating them with preoperative clinical diagnoses to assess diagnostic accuracy and guide optimal management. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 198 patients who underwent appendectomies between August 2023 and July 2024. Resected appendix specimens underwent histopathological examination and were categorized as inflamed, malignant, or benign. Clinical data and histopathological findings were compared using statistical analyses, including Fisher's exact test, to assess diagnostic accuracy and explore potential associations between patient demographics, appendicitis severity, and clinical presentation. The study cohort consisted predominantly of young males (78.8%, mean age: 26 ± 9.2 years), with no pediatric cases included. The most common histopathological finding was an inflamed appendix (99.5%), with acute inflammation being most prevalent (86.9%). Perforation (10.1%) and gangrenous changes (2.5%) were also observed. A rare case of negative appendectomy (0.5%) was attributed to a perforated Meckel's diverticulum. This study demonstrates a high preoperative diagnostic accuracy for acute appendicitis. However, the occurrence of negative appendectomies and complicated cases, particularly in young adult males, highlights the need for continuous vigilance and refinement of diagnostic approaches. Further research exploring age- and sex-specific risk factors for complicated appendicitis is crucial to optimizing patient management strategies and minimizing unnecessary surgical interventions."

    "abstract": "Umbilical and ventral hernias in patients with cirrhosis cause significant morbidity including flood syndrome, bowel obstruction, and pain and limit quality of life. Ascites and portal hypertension increase the risk of complications, resulting in apprehension with intervention and costly cycles of readmission. No studies have explored the safety or efficacy of robotic-assisted repair of primary umbilical hernias in this population. We performed a retrospective review of patients with cirrhosis at a single institution who underwent elective or emergent robotic hernia repair between June 2023 and May 2024. A total of 7 patients were included with a median MELD-Na of 17 (IQR 14-22) and the majority of whom (6 of 7, 85.7%) had ascites at the time of surgery. Three patients required emergent or urgent operations. No drains were required at the time of surgery. There were no Clavien-Dindo grade 3 or higher complications, no patients had leakage of ascites from their incisions, and no patients developed hernia recurrence (median follow-up 173 days). There were 2 Clavien-Dindo grade 1 or 2 complications: one superficial skin infection treated with antibiotics and one case of urinary retention. This limited series suggests that robotic hernia repair is technically feasible and safe in a select group of patients with cirrhosis including those with ascites. We propose an approach to robotic-assisted hernia repair in these complex patients."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common pediatric surgical emergency. Diagnosis may be made by targeted point of care ultrasound (POCUS) of the right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdomen. This can be performed by trained emergency physicians and has similar accuracy to ultrasound performed by radiology technologists and interpreted by radiologists (RADUS) [1,2]. Pediatric patients with appendicitis may present without classical clinical signs and symptoms. Retrocecal appendicitis is often diagnosed late at perforation due to the anatomical position limiting diagnosis with ultrasound, despite the high prevalence of retrocecal appendix as an anatomic variation (up to 65%). Given the limited sensitivity for ultrasound in the diagnosis of appendicitis in patients with retrocecal appendix, these patients often undergo advanced imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially when increased abdominal wall thickness and/or high Body Mass Index (BMI) further limit the ultrasound examination [4-6]. We present a case series of retrocecal appendicitis imaged and diagnosed with POCUS, using novel transducer and patient positioning. In addition to standard graded compression of the RLQ with POCUS, this technique may add to the diagnostic accuracy of patients presenting atypically with anatomic variants."

The differential etiology included primary cholecystitis or infiltrative metastatic mass in the setting of known peritoneal carcinomatosis. Point of care contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) examination was performed and was able to rule out local tumor infiltration, which was later confirmed by pathology after cholecystectomy. In this case, the identification and confirmation of gallbladder perforation on imaging allowed for more conservative management with image-guided drain placement in a patient who was not an optimal surgical candidate at the time and underwent delayed cholecystectomy. This case report emphasizes the role of CEUS in providing detailed information about gallbladder wall perfusion and integrity with the potential to predict impending gallbladder perforation by demonstrating areas of gallbladder wall hypoperfusion and necrosis as well as visualizing infiltrative lesions."

It is challenging to diagnose preoperatively, with 2 closed loops on CT scan as its characteristic feature. This case revealed 3 nearly situated closed loops, which offers insights into the diagnosis and management of the ileo-ileal knot. A 69-year-old female patient presented with a 3-h history of upper abdominal pain and repeated vomiting. Contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed a poorly enhanced small-bowel obstruction, with 3 nearly situated closed loops. The patient was diagnosed with a strangulated small-bowel obstruction, likely caused by an unusual internal hernia. Emergency laparoscopic surgery was performed. Due to the difficulty in assessing the intestinal condition and the risk of injury, the procedure was converted to open surgery. Direct evaluation during laparotomy confirmed the diagnosis of an ileo-ileal knot. The knot was untied, further improving bowel color and peristalsis and allowing bowel preservation. Based on the retrospective evaluation of the reconstructed CT scan images and intraoperative findings, the 3 closed loops comprised 2 tied loops and 1 knotting loop. The patient initially recovered. However, she was readmitted on postoperative day 24 due to bowel obstruction caused by fibrosis near the terminal ileum. After undergoing ileocolic resection, the patient recovered uneventfully. An ileo-ileal knot should be considered in cases of strangulated bowel obstruction with more than 2 closed loops. Because the intraoperative assessment of the knot is challenging, laparoscopic surgery can be difficult. Therefore, early conversion to laparotomy should be considered."

    "title": "Parasitic appendicitis, what do we know?-a literature review.",
    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis (AA) is a leading cause of emergency abdominal surgery worldwide, with surgical intervention as its mainstay of treatment. As a primarily clinical diagnosis, it is important for physicians to have ample information to diagnose cases accurately. Given the high rates of negative appendectomies, robust diagnostic workups are crucial to minimize unnecessary surgeries and consider adjunct therapy. Various etiologies, including parasitic infections, are associated with AA. In this review, we report that Schistosoma spp., Enterobius vermicularis (E. vermicularis), Taenia spp., and Ascaris lumbricoides (A. lumbricoides) contribute to or mimic AA. As globalization expands, areas once considered \"safe zones\" for parasites now face higher risks. It is therefore increasingly important for physicians in all countries to recognize the association between parasites and AA and include proper investigations for high-risk patients. Our findings aim to assist physicians on when to consider a parasitic infection and AA, potentially reducing the number of negative appendectomies, as some parasitic infections can be treated with medication alone. To our knowledge, this narrative review incorporating three databases (PubMed, Ovid and Embase), is the first to synthesize research on the relationship between parasites and AA. Articles were screened using Covidence, and inclusion criteria required references to Schistosoma spp., E. vermicularis, Taenia spp., and A. lumbricoides. We limited results to English and French manuscripts published between 1949 and 2023. Two independent reviewers performed title and abstract screening, followed by full-text analysis, ultimately selecting 71 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis identifies four parasitic organisms strongly associated with AA-Schistosoma spp., E. vermicularis, Taenia spp., and A. lumbricoides-and highlights countries where these infections are most prevalent. Furthermore, it highlights the need for more research in this area as causal relationships are still yet to be made. While strong associations exist between parasitic infections and AA, further research is needed to establish a causal relationship."

    "abstract": "Intragastric balloons (IGBs) are widely used as a temporary weight-loss measure to induce early satiety and delay gastric emptying. Despite their safety profile, rare complications such as migration and small bowel obstruction (SBO) may occur, particularly when follow-up for timely removal is neglected. We present a case of a 48-year-old female with a history of obesity who arrived at the emergency department complaining of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and obstipation of three days duration. Imaging revealed a dilated stomach and duodenum, with a fluid-filled IGB lodged in the proximal jejunum, causing SBO. Push enteroscopy was performed using a colonoscope, and the IGB was retrieved successfully from the jejunum into the stomach and removed entirely, avoiding the need for surgery. The patient recovered without complications and was discharged the following day. This case demonstrates an innovative approach to managing SBO caused by IGB migration. While surgery is typically the preferred method for small bowel impaction, endoscopic retrieval presents a viable, less invasive option. This article highlights the importance of gastroenterology consultation in managing migrated IGBs and reviews different techniques for endoscopic retrieval. We conclude that endoscopic management of migrated IGB causing SBO should be considered a first-line approach to minimize complications and shorten hospital stays, provided a backup surgical team is available."

Clinical examination revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness and guarding, with stable vitals. Laboratory results showed leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein. Abdominal ultrasound and a limited non-contrast computed tomography scan, suggested ileocecal intussusception, but the appendix was not visualized, indicating it as the leading point. Intraoperatively, an inflamed appendix with mucocele and a Type IV intussusception, where the appendix telescoped into itself and the cecum, was found. Manual reduction, appendectomy, and partial cecectomy were performed. Histopathology confirmed severe appendiceal inflammation but no malignancy.

However, imaging contradicted the initial leading diagnosis and revealed a markedly distended, hydropic gallbladder with its tip near the umbilicus. Findings of the distended gallbladder with marked wall thickening and pericholecystic fat stranding and edema confirmed acute cholecystitis, and the patient was taken by general surgery for cholecystectomy. Together, this unusual presentation and this unexpected diagnosis shine light upon another facet of the hydropic gallbladder while also serving as a salient reminder to contemplate a broad differential regardless of seemingly classic presentations of illnesses.

    "abstract": "Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a potentially fatal vascular emergency that results in tissue damage due to ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and is difficult to diagnose and treat in its early stages. Monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitors have demonstrated protective effects against ischemia-reperfusion injury due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of KML29, a potent and selective monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitor, on intestinal IRI. Thirty-two female Wistar albino rats were divided into four groups: Group 1 - Sham; Group 2 - Ischemia/Reperfusion (IR); Group 3 - IR + KML29 (2 mg/kg); and Group 4 - IR + KML29 (10 mg/kg). Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion was induced by occluding the superior mesenteric artery for 45 minutes, followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion. KML29 was administered intraperitoneally to Groups 3 and 4 at doses of 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively, 30 minutes prior to surgery. Intestinal IRI was evaluated using histopathological and biochemical parameters. Treatment with 10 mg/kg KML29 was associated with improved histopathological findings in the IR group (p=0.0001). Elevated levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) observed in the IR group were significantly reduced following administration of 10 mg/kg KML29 (p=0.0001). Additionally, treatment with both 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg doses of KML29 significantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells in the IR group (p=0.0001). In conclusion, this study demonstrated that treatment with both doses of KML29 (2.5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) significantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells and inflammatory markers, and improved histopathological findings in the intestinal tissues of rats subjected to IR. With its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties, KML29 may represent a novel therapeutic option for the treatment of mesenteric ischemia."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis (AA) is the most common indication for emergency surgery in general surgery worldwide, with peak incidence occurring in the second and fifth decades of life. The main symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and pain that typically begins around the umbilicus and migrates to the lower right quadrant. While the most frequent cause is fekaloids, intestinal parasites, tumors, and fruit seeds may also rarely contribute to the etiology of appendicitis. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of parasitic infections in the etiology of AA, along with associated demographic and histopathological findings in adult patients who underwent appendectomy. The records of 10,658 patients over the age of 15 who underwent appendectomy between January 2011 and January 2023 were retrospectively reviewed. Based on histopathological findings, 114 patients who underwent appendectomy due to parasitic infestation were included in the study. According to the pathology results, a total of 114 patients underwent appendectomy due to parasitic infestation. Of these, 53 (46.5%) were female and 61 (53.5%) were male. Histopathological examination revealed that 70 cases (61.4%) were diagnosed as acute appendicitis, 22 (19.3%) as suppurative, 15 (13.2%) as gangrenous, and seven (6.1%) as perforated appendicitis. In terms of etiology, Taenia saginata was identified in four patients (3.5%), Ascaris lumbricoides in two patients (1.8%), and Enterobius vermicularis (EV) eggs or parasites in 108 patients (94.7%). Parasitic infections, particularly Enterobius vermicularis, may contribute to the development of acute appendicitis, although their exact role in the pathogenesis remains unclear. In our study, Enterobius vermicularis was the most common cause of parasite-related appendicitis."

    "abstract": "Abdominal disorders represent 10 to 15% of all Emergency Department visits in elderly patients. This educational review focuses on acute abdomen pathologies specific to the elderly and on their imaging patterns and proposes a strategy for performing CT scans in this population. Bowel obstruction is the most common cause of emergency surgery in the elderly with a higher proportion of colonic obstructions, in particular obstructive colorectal cancer and sigmoid volvulus. Concerning abdominal inflammatory processes, such as cholecystitis, appendicitis, and diverticulitis, gangrenous cholecystitis and complicated appendicitis are relatively frequently encountered due to delayed diagnoses. Bowel ischemia, which includes acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) and ischemic colitis (IC), is also much more common after the age of 80. Although ischemic colitis is mainly related to cardiovascular risk factors, it can also result from a persistent distension above a colonic cancer or from fecal impaction. Finally, extra-abdominal pathologies responsible for acute abdominal pain, such as inferior myocardial infarction, should not be overlooked. In clinical practice, when possible thanks to sufficient and appropriate radiological resources, we recommend a scan without injection of contrast and an injection depending on the results of the unenhanced scan, decided by the radiologist present at the CT scan room during the examination. CRITICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: CT is critical in the diagnosis and management of patients over 75 years old with an acute abdomen, given the difficulty of clinico-biological diagnosis, the frequency of complicated forms, and the morbidity induced by delayed diagnosis. KEY POINTS: The most common site and cause of bowel obstruction in the elderly is large bowel obstruction due to colon cancer. Discrepancy between a poor clinical examination and complicated forms on imaging, particularly for inflammation and infections, is responsible for late diagnosis and increased morbidity. Ischemia, including of the small bowel, colon, and gallbladder are common cause of acute abdomen in elderly. In patients with upper quadrant pain, consider extra-abdominal causes such as pneumonia or myocardial infarction."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is one of the most common surgical emergencies (8.6 % in men and 6.4 % in women), with varying presentations, including complications such as appendicular abscess. While the typical clinical course involves right lower quadrant pain and fever, rare complications can present with atypical symptoms, particularly in high-risk patients such as those with diabetes. A 55-year-old diabetic female presented with a 10-day history of worsening abdominal pain, foul-smelling discharge at the anterior abdominal wall below the umbilicus, and fever. Imaging revealed an appendicular abscess extending into the anterior abdominal wall. Emergency exploratory laparotomy showed a perforated appendix with a purulent collection in the peritoneal cavity extending to the anterior abdominal wall, requiring drainage and right hemicolectomy. Perforated appendicitis (incidence of 20-30 %), particularly in diabetic patients, can lead to localized abscesses or soft tissue infections in atypical locations such as the abdominal wall. These rare complications are more likely in immunocompromised individuals, including those with diabetes, where the incidence of perforated appendicitis is notably higher. Early imaging with ultrasonography or Contrast Enhanced Computed Tomography is critical for identifying complicated appendicitis and guiding surgical intervention. Anterior abdominal wall abscesses as a complication of perforated appendicitis are rare but significant. This case underscores the importance of early and accurate diagnosis, supported by imaging, to guide appropriate surgical management. Timely intervention can help prevent life-threatening conditions such as necrotizing fasciitis, improve patient outcomes, and reduce the risk of postoperative complications, particularly in high-risk populations."

We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical data from 158 patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy after admission to the emergency day-surgery ward of our hospital from January to December 2022. The patients were categorized into two groups based on the length of stay: the daytime group (length of stay ≤48 hours) and the routine group (length of stay >48 hours). We compared the effects of preoperative assessments, intraoperative variables, and postoperative outcomes on the discharge of the patients between the two groups. Preoperative analysis of general data revealed that the time to discharge of patients undergoing daytime laparoscopic appendectomy (P < .05) were significantly influenced age; leukocyte, monocyte, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts; systemic inflammation response index (SIRI); and appendix diameter. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified appendix diameter (P = .017), SIRI (P = .024), and white blood cell count (P = .037) as independent risk factors affecting postoperative discharge in patients after daytime laparoscopic appendectomy. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that SIRI (ROC: 0.876; cutoff: 4.74), white blood cell count (ROC: 0.692; cutoff: 11.995), and appendix diameter (ROC: 0.760; cutoff: 9.5) could predict short-term hospital discharge, with SIRI exhibiting the highest predictive value. Intraoperative operation times, placement of drainage tubes, and pathological type also significantly influenced the discharge time (P < .05). : SIRI, white blood cell count, and appendix diameter are key factors influencing the discharge of patients undergoing emergency day-surgery appendicitis."

    "abstract": "Lynch syndrome is the most common hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC) syndrome, accounting for 3-5% of all CRC cases. Situs inversus totalis (SIT) is a rare congenital malformation with an incidence of 1 in 8,000 to 1 in 25,000. The co-occurrence of Lynch syndrome and SIT is extremely uncommon. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have demonstrated significant efficacy in treating microsatellite instability-high/deficient mismatch repair (MSI-H/dMMR) CRC. Tumors associated with Lynch syndrome frequently exhibit MSI-H, providing a theoretical basis for ICI use. We report a case of bifocal colon cancer associated with Lynch syndrome and SIT. After seven cycles of sintilimab, the patient developed gastrointestinal perforation due to tumor regression, necessitating emergency surgery. The anatomical variations associated with SIT required the surgical team to adopt an alternative approach. Postoperatively, the patient continued sintilimab treatment for 2 years. In June 2024, he underwent a colostomy reversal and proximal colectomy. Pathological examination revealed a tumor regression grade (TRG) of 0, indicating complete pathological remission (pCR), with no recurrence or metastasis detected upon follow-up. The anatomical variations associated with SIT increase the complexity of surgical procedures. Advanced imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are essential for assessing fine anatomical details and facilitating surgery. ICIs are an effective treatment option for Lynch syndrome-associated CRC, as demonstrated in this case. Future studies should investigate the optimal timing of immunotherapy, combination treatment strategies, and methods to mitigate immune-related toxicities. Such research will help develop comprehensive and personalized treatment plans for Lynch syndrome-associated CRC."

Isolated gallbladder injury from a fist fight is rare, however, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with abdominal pain following minor blunt abdominal trauma."

    "abstract": "Point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tools can support timely and efficient clinical decision-making. The introduction of a POC digital rectoscope has the potential to enhance colorectal surgical practice by enabling immediate bedside endoscopic evaluation in different settings. This case series describes 5 cases, with video documentation illustrating the potential benefits of using a portable digital rectoscope in outpatient follow-up, inpatient postoperative care, and emergency settings. In a tertiary referral center, POC rectoscopy effectively supported the detection of anastomotic leakage and rectal perforation, response evaluation after neoadjuvant treatment for rectal cancer, and facilitated follow-up after treatment for anastomotic leakage. POC digital rectoscopy shows promise in enhancing the diagnostic efficiency of colorectal care. Further studies are warranted to evaluate its clinical impact and cost-effectiveness for the illustrated indications."

    "abstract": "Data on complications associated with emergency ureteroscopy for ureteral stones are limited, particularly in developing countries. This study investigates factors contributing to complications in emergency ureteroscopy utilizing a pneumatic semirigid ureteroscope (URS). This retrospective analysis included 266 patients with ureteral stones who underwent emergency ureteroscopy using a pneumatic semirigid URS from 2018 to 2023. We extracted comprehensive data on patient demographics, stone characteristics, intraoperative and postoperative complications, and stone-free rate (SFR) from medical records, subsequently subjected to statistical analysis. Factors linked to complications were explored through univariate and multivariate analyses. The mean stone size was 9.1 ± 4.9 mm, with the majority (n = 181, 71.3%) located in the mid-ureter. The mean operative duration was 57.7 ± 7.3 min. The overall complication rate was 10.2%, with intraoperative complications in 16 patients (6.0%), including mucosal damage (3.4%), stone up-migration (3.0%), and one ureteral perforation (0.4%). Postoperative complications occurred in 13 patients (4.9%), primarily fever (2.6%), followed by hematuria (1.1%). Additional complications included febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs), pyelonephritis, and one mortality. The overall SFR was 85.3%, with 39 patients (14.7%) demonstrating residual stones. Significant predictive factors for complications included larger stone size (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]: 1.3; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.15-1.39, p<0.0001) and proximal ureteral stones (AOR: 4.9; 95% CI: 1.31-18.23, p=0.0182). Emergency ureteroscopy using a semirigid URS demonstrated favorable outcomes in treating ureteral stones, characterized by minimal complications and an acceptable SFR. Emphasizing appropriate instrument selection, surgical expertise, and technique is crucial in minimizing adverse events, particularly for large and upper ureteral stones."

However, surgery is sometimes necessary when the primary character of the peritonitis is uncertain. We report herein the case of a 24-year-old patient, with no particular medical history and who presented to the emergency department for diffuse abdominal pain with fever. Abdominal examination found diffuse abdominal tenderness with hyperleukocytosis. A computed tomography scan showed generalized intraperitoneal effusion with no obvious abdominal infectious hotbed, nor pneumoperitoneum. However, it showed lateral basal pneumonia. Laparoscopic exploration confirmed the diagnosis of peritonitis but didn´t find any obvious cause. She had a peritoneal cleansing with an appendectomy of principle. Then she was put on probabilistic broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotic therapy. However bacteriological examination of the peritoneal fluid and blood cultures were negative. The surgical postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged at post-operative day 5."

We present the case of a 32-year-old woma, with a two-month history of retroviral infection, admitted for dysuria associated with hypogastric pain and fever, progressing over the past week. The urgent uro-CT scan led to the diagnosis of emphysematous cystitis, requiring a multidisciplinary approach for management. Emphysematous cystitis (EC) arises from infections caused by gas-producing bacteria. Complications associated with EC may involve bladder rupture, peritonitis, and/or emphysematous pyelonephritis, hence the importance of early diagnosis and adequate managment.

Our case underscores the unusual size and configuration of intussusception, wherein the distal segment telescopes into the proximal segment, defying the conventional presentation. Notably, the rarity of observing intussusception following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery is also highlighted. It is important to be clinically vigilant and keep long term sequalae of bariatric surgery on the differential. A 56-year-old female with a remote history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery presented with epigastric pain radiating to the lower left and right quadrants, nausea, and vomiting of 1-day duration. She was on a prolonged outpatient course of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids for pain management following recent orthopedic procedure. In the emergency department, she was afebrile, saturating well on two liters of oxygen, and normotensive with sinus tachycardia. Labs showed leukocytosis with mildly elevated lipase, alkaline phosphatase, and lactic acid. Initial CT abdomen pelvis with contrast was unremarkable. The patient continued to experience abdominal pain with worsening lactic acid. Repeat imaging revealed a 10 cm enteroenteric intussusception containing proximal jejunum with the gastric bypass Roux limb acting as the intussuscipiens. No obvious mass or lead point was identified. Ulceration/stricture at the jejunojejunal anastomosis was thought to be contributory to this. The patient underwent successful laparoscopic surgery."

    "abstract": "\"Cat scratch colon\" (CSC), characterized by spontaneous bright-red linear markings or mucosal laceration with bleeding due to air insufflation barotrauma, is a rare complication during colonoscopy. These mucosal lacerations can present as superficial tears that do not generally have clinical repercussions or as deeper tears that damage the muscularis and cause perforation. CSC occurs in the colon with submucosal stiffening disease, such as collagenous colitis; however, in cases unrelated to these diseases, CSC appears in the cecum or ascending colon for anatomical reasons. Herein, we report a case of CSC that caused cecal perforation. A 79-year-old woman underwent a colonoscopy for anal bleeding. Although insertion of the colonoscope was easy, as soon as the cecum expanded with air insufflation, the cecal mucosa was torn, and bleeding occurred. The endoscopist determined these findings as shallow mucosal tears and inactive bleeding, and a colonoscopy was completed. She visited our hospital 2 days after colonoscopy with a complaint of abdominal pain that appeared in the morning after colonoscopy. Computed tomography revealed inflammation around the cecum, with free air. Emergency surgery was performed to diagnose an iatrogenic colonic perforation caused by colonoscopy. During surgery, a necrotic area was found in the cecal wall, requiring ileocecal resection. The resected specimen showed cecal mucosal tears with necrosis, which were pathologically consistent with cecal rupture resulting from mucosal laceration. The postoperative course was uneventful. When CSC is encountered along with endoscopic findings of deep mucosal tears in the colon, the possibility of perforation after colonoscopy should be considered."

    "abstract": "Taenia saginata, commonly known as the beef tapeworm, is a prevalent zoonotic cestode with an estimated global prevalence of 60-70 million carriers. This parasite is frequently located in the gastrointestinal tract, and previous reports have described complications such as acute appendicitis, Meckel's diverticulitis, pancreatitis, cholecystitis, liver abscess, intestinal obstruction, and perforation. Intestinal perforation due to parasitic diseases is a rare complication. Surgical complications associated with T. saginata are uncommon, with few reported cases of bowel perforation. Here, we present the case of a 69-year-old female who was admitted to the emergency department with acute abdominal symptoms. She had experienced abdominal pain and vomiting for 15 days. Her symptoms were accompanied by abdominal distension, reduced bowel movements, and loss of appetite. On physical examination, she had diffuse abdominal tenderness, guarding, and rebound tenderness, raising suspicion of peritonitis. Laboratory tests revealed a white blood cell count of 8,000/mm3 and an elevated C-reactive protein level of 501 mg/L, indicating an ongoing inflammatory response. Imaging revealed free intra-abdominal air and fluid, suggesting gastrointestinal perforation. During emergency surgery, a perforation in the upper rectum was identified and resected. Pathological examination confirmed the presence of T. saginata eggs in the intestinal wall. Postoperatively, the patient recovered well and was discharged on the sixth day. This case underscores the need for heightened awareness of parasitic infections as potential causes of acute abdominal conditions. Proper diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention are crucial in managing complications associated with T. saginata. Preventive measures, including thorough cooking of beef and improved sanitation, are essential to reduce the incidence of such infections."

    "abstract": "Pediatric gallbladder torsion is a rare but potentially life-threatening cause of acute abdomen. The first case was reported in the 19th century, yet the precise pathogenesis remains unclear. Due to its nonspecific symptoms, gallbladder torsion in children is frequently misdiagnosed as more common conditions, such as acute appendicitis, cholecystitis, or gastrointestinal infections. A 2-year and 4-month-old boy was admitted to our emergency department with abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting. Initial blood tests revealed a white blood cell count of 13.13 × 109/L, neutrophil percentage at 76.1%, and an absolute neutrophil count of 9.99 × 109/L. Abdominal CT indicated thickened gallbladder walls, a partially blurred appendix margin, an intraluminal dense shadow, and multiple enlarged lymph nodes, along with pelvic effusion. A diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made. Emergency laparoscopy showed a suppurative appendix, leading to an appendectomy. Further inspection revealed a 360° counterclockwise torsion of the gallbladder neck with necrosis and black discoloration, without perforation. A laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. Nine days postoperatively, the child developed symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection, necessitating transfer to the pediatric respiratory department, and was discharged on postoperative day 19 with no complications. Laparoscopic exploration for pediatric acute appendicitis should include the gallbladder as a standard investigation target."

The present study aims to evaluate the association between cholinesterase and postoperative complications in patients with lower gastrointestinal perforation. The study included 71 patients who had undergone emergency surgery for lower gastrointestinal perforation. We retrospectively investigated the relationship between preoperative serum cholinesterase levels and postoperative complications. Complications were defined as Clavien-Dindo (C-D) grade II or higher, with severe complications classified as C-D grade III-V. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses to evaluate independent risk factors for postoperative complications. Among of all, 43 patients (61%) developed postoperative all complications (C-D ≥ II), and 17 patients (24%) developed severe complications (C-D ≥ III-V). In multivariate analysis, cholinesterase (p=0.006), C-reactive protein (p=0.028), and blood loss (p=0.028) were independent risk factors for postoperative all complications (C-D ≥ II). Also, cholinesterase (p=0.006) was an independent risk factors for postoperative severe complication (C-D ≥ III- V). Patients in the cholinesterase-low group had significantly lower preoperative hemoglobin (p=0.001), albumin (p<0.001), and prognostic nutritional index (p<0.001), as well as higher C-reactive protein (p=0.010), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (p=0.038), proportion of wound infection (30% vs. 4.8%, p=0.026) and abdominal abscess (30% vs. 0.0%, p=0.003) compared to those in the cholinesterase-high group. Preoperative serum cholinesterase levels may be associated with postoperative severe course in patients with lower gastrointestinal perforation. This association underscores the potential role of cholinesterase as an indicator of nutritional and inflammatory status."

Their functionality is programmed during daily production in the bone marrow through granulopoiesis. During severe inflammation, increased neutrophil demand is met through activation of emergency granulopoiesis. The effect of emergency granulopoiesis on neutrophil functionality remains cryptic. In the present study, we assessed neutrophil function in mice injected with G-CSF (100 µg/kg/d for 3 days) to activate emergency granulopoiesis. We found that emergency granulopoiesis neutrophils exhibit impaired ROS production (n = 6, P = 0.003) and NETosis (n = 5, P < 0.01), but increase neutrophil elastase secretion (n = 9, P < 0.0001) and LPS-induced Tnfa, Il1b, Il1a, Il12a, and Ccl2 expression (n = 13, P < 0.01). To test the impact of emergency granulopoiesis neutrophils on the inflammatory response in vivo, we pre-treated mice with G-CSF and challenged them with zymosan to induce peritonitis. At 4 h post-zymosan injection, peritoneal neutrophils from G-CSF treated mice exhibit increased expression of Ccl2 (n = 3, P < 0.05). Subsequently, we observed enhanced peritoneal macrophage accumulation at 48 h post-zymosan administration in G-CSF-treated mice (n = 5, P < 0.05). These data indicate that emergency granulopoiesis programs neutrophils to have an enhanced immunomodulatory function that orchestrates the subsequent macrophage response in local tissue inflammation."

    "abstract": "Foreign body (FB) ingestion is common, particularly among children. While most FBs pass through the gastrointestinal tract without complications, some cases can lead to morbidity or even mortality. Management strategies depend on the size, sharpness, toxicity, and location of the FB. Plain radiographs are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and follow-up, especially for radiopaque FBs. Ingestion of dental-related FBs is rare, with reported cases involving orthodontic wires, braces, retainers, and other dental materials. Composite resin-wire splints are commonly used in orthodontics to manage dental traumatic injuries. We present a case of a patient who ingested a composite resin-wire splint, initially misclassified as a sharp FB, leading to unnecessary aggressive treatment. A 2-year-old girl presented to the emergency department after accidentally ingesting a FB of dental origin. She had a recent traumatic dental injury and displayed no symptoms of ingestion. Initial radiographs revealed a dental wire in the stomach. Ingestion of orthodontic splint (composite resin-wire splint). Considering the pointed tip of the wire, the emergency department physician transferred her to the endoscopy specialist for endoscopic removal. However, given the expected passage into the small bowel after a proper fasting period for endoscopy, close observation with follow-up radiographs was chosen amid parental anxiety. Follow-up imaging showed FB migration to the ascending colon without perforation. Stool inspection revealed the dental wire and 4 composite resins, with the sharp tips covered by the resin, classifying it as a blunt FB. A retrospective review of radiographs revealed faint oval-shaped, mid-level radiopacities at each end of the wire covering the sharp/pointed tips. In evaluating orthodontic splints as FBs, identifying faint composite resin on radiographs is crucial for planning milder treatment and alleviating parental anxiety."

    "abstract": "A 73-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency department with dyspnea and severe edema in the lower extremities. The patient had been diagnosed with extensive small-cell lung cancer 15 months previously. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed suprahepatic compression of the inferior vena cava (IVC) at the level of its entry into the right atrium, caused by a space-occupying, infiltrating right lung lesion. Inferior vena cava syndrome (IVCS) occurs after obstruction of venous flow through the IVC. Trunk and lower limb edema are the most common manifestations of this syndrome, whereas cardiac function may be compromised in more severe cases. Given the patient's performance status, disease stage, and symptom acuity, endovascular stenting of the IVC was preferred over surgery or radiotherapy. The superior vena cava (SVC)-to-IVC bridging stent approach was employed to address the severe mass effect and location of the IVC stenosis at its junction with the right atrium. Three uncovered self-expandable stents were deployed in tandem from the SVC to the IVC. Overlap between stents minimized the risk of collapse within the right atrium, possibly leading to cardiac conduction disorders or even perforation of the heart wall. The patient experienced alleviation of IVCS symptoms over the next 48 h but unfortunately passed away 8 days later from his primary disease. Although primarily palliative in oncologic cases, SVC-to-IVC stenting can offer rapid and safe relief of symptoms in patients with advanced oncologic disease by restoring venous return to the heart."

To compare the short-term clinical outcomes of mSLAN with those of conventional three-port laparoscopic appendectomy (CLA) for patients with acute uncomplicated appendicitis. This single-center, single-blind, prospective, randomized controlled trial included patients who underwent emergency laparoscopic appendectomy for acute uncomplicated appendicitis at our center between April 2024 and August 2024. Patients were randomly divided into the mSLAN group or the CLA group via computer-generated randomization. The primary endpoint was the 24-hour postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) score, and the secondary endpoints included the operative time, 24-hour postoperative inflammatory response biomarkers (including white blood cells, the neutrophil ratio, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein), time to first postoperative exhaust, time to first out-of-bed activity, postoperative length of hospital stay, cost of hospitalization, and incidence of postoperative complications.

The 24-hour VAS scores, 24-hour postoperative inflammatory response marker levels, first postoperative exhaust times, first out-of-bed activity times, postoperative lengths of hospital stay, operative times, or hospitalization costs did not significantly differ between the two groups. No postoperative complications, including incision infection or hernia, abdominal abscess or intestinal obstruction, were observed during the 1-month postoperative follow-up in either group. Compared with the CLA protocol, the mSLAN protocol for acute uncomplicated appendicitis yielded comparable short-term clinical outcomes, with a similar operative time and better cosmetic outcomes, indicating its potential for clinical application and superiority for patients with high cosmetic requirements. Further research is needed to evaluate the long-term outcomes."

    "abstract": "Emergency pancreaticoduodenectomy (EPD) is an uncommon abdominal surgical procedure primarily performed in patients with severe acute abdominal trauma. Performing EPD requires strict surgical criteria, advanced technical expertise, and comprehensive postoperative management. Limited research exists regarding the indications for non-traumatic EPD. Thus, the objective of this study was to synthesize and analyze recent cases of non-traumatic EPD, thereby enhancing the comprehension of this urgent surgical measure. A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients who underwent non-traumatic EPD at the 900th Hospital of the Joint Logistics Support Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army from January 2013 to September 2023. The study assessed preoperative etiologies, intraoperative findings, postoperative complications, and prognosis. Additionally, a literature review was performed. Nine patients underwent non-traumatic EPD. All patients demonstrated clear indications for emergency surgery: three cases of gastrointestinal hemorrhage secondary to ulcerative lesions, three cases of perforation (n = 2) and bleeding (n = 1) following invasive endoscopic procedures for neoplastic lesions, two cases of tumor rupture-related hemorrhage, and one case of postoperative anastomotic bleeding. All patients completed the surgical procedure. The operative duration ranged from 185.0 to 480.0 min, with a mean of 299.9 ± 83.3 min, and intraoperative blood loss ranged from 100.0 to 6,000.0 ml, with a mean of 1,477.8 ± 1,944.7 ml. Postoperative pathology revealed that 3 cases involved benign ulcerative lesions of the digestive tract and 6 cases involved neoplastic lesions in the pancreaticoduodenal region. One patient died 6 days postoperatively due to multiple organ failure, another died 42 days postoperatively due to tumor progression, and the remaining 7 patients recovered and were discharged, with a postoperative hospital stay of 17-45 days, mean 36.3 ± 10.5 days. Postoperative complications occurred in six patients (85.7%), including pancreatic fistula, biliary fistula, and abdominal infection, all of which resolved with conservative management. In cases of non-traumatic emergencies in the pancreaticoduodenal region where conservative or minimally invasive treatments fail to control the acute progression, EPD serves as a critical surgical intervention that may save lives and yield favorable outcomes."

The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (assessed in the intention-to-treat population), defined as time from randomisation to the first radiological or clinical progression (or both), or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (defined as time from randomisation to death due to any cause) and objective response rate (defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall complete or partial response). Hazard ratio and 95% CIs were estimated using an unstratified Cox proportional hazards model. When the proportional hazards assumption was violated, the restricted mean survival time was used to estimate the treatment effect size. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03006432, and EudraCT, 2016-002331-16. Between Dec 19, 2016, and Dec 26, 2022, 507 patients were randomly assigned (254 to the TFOX group and 253 to the FOLFOX group [intention-to-treat population]). The median age was 64·2 years (IQR 56·7-70·8), and 399 (79%) participants were male and 108 (21%) were female. At median follow-up of 42·8 months (25·8-49·9), the median progression-free survival was 7·59 months (95% CI 7·06-7·95) in the TFOX group versus 5·98 months (5·65-6·97) in the FOLFOX group. The assumption of proportional hazards was violated (p=0·013); therefore, the 12-month restricted mean progression-free survival was calculated: 7·52 months (7·06-7·97) in the TFOX group versus 6·62 months (6·16-7·09) in the FOLFOX group (p=0·0072). The median overall survival was 15·08 months (13·70-16·72) in the TFOX group versus 12·65 months (10·94-14·00) in the FOLFOX group (proportional hazards assumption was confirmed; HR 0·82 [0·68-0·99]; p=0·048) and the objective response rate was 62·3% (56·0-68·3) versus 53·4% (47·0-59·8; p=0·045). The most common grade 3 and 4 treatment-emergent adverse events were diarrhoea (37 [15%] in the TFOX group vs 18 [7%] in the FOLFOX group), peripheral neuropathy (80 [32%] vs 49 [20%]), neutropenia (67 [27%] vs 44 [18%]), and fatigue (40 [16%] vs 20 [8%]). Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 66 (27%) participants in the TFOX group and 33 (13%) in the FOLFOX group. There were two (<1%) treatment-related deaths in the TFOX group (one due to septic shock and one due to gastrointestinal perforation) and one (<1%) in the FOLFOX group (due to septic shock). The modified FLOT/TFOX regimen significantly improved progression-free survival, overall survival, and objective response rate compared with FOLFOX in previously untreated patients with advanced HER2-negative gastric and gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. The modified FLOT/TFOX regimen might represent a new first-line treatment option for patients eligible for this docetaxel triplet chemotherapy. Fédération Francophone de Cancérologie Digestive."

    "abstract": "Triage nurse-initiated imaging orders (TNIO) are a promising strategy to improve emergency department (ED) efficiency and length of stay (LOS). However, limited data exists on the impact of TNIO ultrasounds in pediatric appendicitis and testicular torsion. This study aimed to measure the utilization of TNIO for appendix and testicular ultrasounds and evaluate their impact on LOS. Secondary objectives included assessing effects on time to pain interventions, time to antibiotics, return visits, departures prior to provider evaluation, and need for additional imaging. A single center, retrospective cohort study of patients aged 0-21 years old presenting to a pediatric ED from 2018 and 2023 who underwent appendix or testicular ultrasounds. Patients bypassing triage or who had pre-triage ultrasound orders were excluded. Patients were grouped by nurse-initiated or provider-initiated ultrasounds. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics and multivariate regression. Of 9594 appendix ultrasounds, 20.4 % were nurse-initiated, reducing LOS by 12.7 % (p < 0.001). Of 2525 testicular ultrasounds, 41.9 % were TNIO, reducing LOS by 6.4 % (p < 0.001). TNIO for appendicitis reduced time to antibiotics by 11.9 % (p < 0.001) but had no effect on time to pain control. TNIO patients had fewer return visits (p < 0.001) but higher rates of departures prior to provider evaluation (p < 0.001). Disparities were observed, with Non-Hispanic Black and Medicaid patients less likely to receive TNIO for appendicitis. Triage nurse-initiated ultrasounds reduce LOS in cases of suspected appendicitis and testicular torsion. Implementing triage nurse-initiated imaging protocols could potentially optimize the care of pediatric patients with these conditions, ultimately improving ED efficiency."

    "abstract": "The spontaneous rupture of the esophagus, called Boerhaave's syndrome, presents a critical medical condition that produces high mortality rates unless appropriate emergency medical care is provided. Endoscopic stenting has risen as a minimally invasive treatment option after surgical procedures lost their popularity for addressing this condition. The study reviews endoscopic stenting results in Boerhaave's syndrome by examining treatment success rates and complication and mortality statistics. A systematic review based on the PRISMA guidelines that included studies from 2014 to 2024 obtained from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted. Patient demographics, intervention characteristics, and clinical outcomes were the primary targets for data extraction during the review process. A random-effects model statistical analysis confirmed endoscopic stenting as an effective treatment, achieving closure success in 72.4% of patients and leak occlusion in 93% of cases. A significant level of study methodological and patient diversity caused high heterogeneity (I2 = 98.85%). Endoscopic stenting provided better outcomes for hospital stay duration and postoperative complications above surgical intervention, although publication bias shows a moderate risk (P = 0.1602). The major limitation related to migration in endoscopic stenting shows promise for improvement as current research develops both stent technology and patient selection methods. Testing outcomes from endoscopic stenting as an acceptable surgical option for Boerhaave's syndrome patients exists, but additional randomized trials need to optimize treatment procedures."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency worldwide, with significant variations in prevalence, presentation and outcomes between high-income countries (HIC) and low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Complicated appendicitis has significant implications for low- and lower-middle-income countries due to limited healthcare resources. While there is extensive evidence for HICs, the evidence for low- and lower-middle-income countries is lacking. This systematic review aimed to compare the prevalence of complicated appendicitis between low-income countries (LICs) and lower-middle-income countries (LoMICs). A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO CRD42024526007). Observational studies and randomized controlled trials published in PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase and Scopus (1990-2024) were retrieved. A grey literature search of Google Scholar and the Cochrane Library was also performed to identify existing reviews on the topic. The primary outcome investigated was the incidence of complicated appendicitis. Eighty-seven articles with 25 582 participants were included. Meta-analyses of outcomes comparing LICs to LoMICs identified an increased pooled proportion of complicated appendicitis (34% (95% CI 27%-41%) vs. 23% (95% CI 19%-27%) P < 0.001), increased post-operative morbidity (19% (95% CI 13%-27%) vs. 13% (95% CI 8%-20%): P < 0.01) and mortality (OR 2.36). Appendicitis remains a major burden in LICs and LoMICs with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. These findings highlight critical deficiencies in surgical access and delivery, underscoring the need for targeted interventions to improve outcomes in these settings."

    "abstract": "WSES guidelines allow open abdomen (OA) for critically ill patients due to secondary peritonitis in the case of inadequate source control, but this option results quite vague and with a low grade of evidence (Grade 2 C). Moreover, the emerging increasing in literature of complications, makes the use of OA in secondary peritonitis more debated. The aim of our study is to analyze the postoperative outcomes of patients undergoing OA versus primary closure (PC) in secondary peritonitis. We collected data from Tertiary Trauma Center from 2019 to 2024. The study included patients who underwent urgent laparotomy for severe secondary peritonitis, divided into two groups based on the strategy chosen in the index laparotomy: PC or OA. We retrospectively analyzed the data, considering as primary outcome post-operative mortality, while as secondary outcomes short terms complications and LOS. 283 patients fit the research for the diagnosis of peritonitis but only 176 were included as with a WSES-SSS > = 7. 128 patients (72,7%) were in the PC group, while 48 (27,3%) were managed with an OA strategy. There were no statistical differences in terms of mortality (p = 0.371), between the two groups. Complications were higher in the OA group (p = 0.001). From the logistic regression only MPI resulted an independent factor of mortality (p = 0.016; OR 1.080). The study shows that OA in severe secondary peritonitis does not improve mortality and is associated with higher short-term complications and incisional hernias. However, RCT are necessary to better investigate the role of OA in the management of abdominal sepsis."

    "abstract": "Colic or acute abdominal pain is the most prevalent cause of emergency intervention in veterinary medicine, and it has been considered the principal reason for collapse and/or euthanasia in a wide range of studies. The condition may be initiated by a number of different disorders affecting the abdominal viscera, but acute gut disease is the most common etiology in equines showing colic symptoms. of the main goals of colic management is to distinguish between surgical and medical causes, as prompt surgical intervention can significantly improve outcomes for those requiring surgery. Despite the widespread use of diagnostics such as laboratory analyses and abdominal diagnostic imaging, the most common diagnostic indicators of the necessity for surgical intervention are the presence of either moderate or severe symptoms of pain reaction, pain recurrence after suitable therapy, and diminished intestinal sounds. Abdominal ultrasonography was performed in equines with signs of abdominal pain as a perfect tool for diagnosing small intestinal strangulation. The detection of unprecedented markers, which may help distinguish medical ailments from others that can be treated surgically, persists as an ongoing research area. This review was designed to highlight different categories of colic in equines with reference to sonographic assessment, diagnosis, and management. Abdominal pain can be divided into two major classes: gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal. The first class can be reasoned by different etiologies, starting from a harmless spasmodic colic to a life-threatening strangulating type of colic. Here, special emphasis will be given to several causes of gastrointestinal colic, including gastric impaction, gastroenteritis, flatulent colic, spasmodic colic, impaction colic, strangulating and obstructive colic, sand colic, verminous mesenteric arteritis, peritonitis, and hernias. This review will also discuss some important causes of non-gastrointestinal colic, including cystitis, urine retention, abdominal abscesses, and mesenteric abscesses. In conclusion, colic in equines is a fatal condition, and most cases do not recover if diagnosed late. Therefore, ancillary diagnostic tools should be implemented. Of these tools, abdominal ultrasound has been proven to be very effective in verifying equines with different causes of colic, such as flatulent colic, spasmodic colic, obstructive colic, impactive colic, strangulating colic, peritonitis, hernias, cystitis, urine retention, and abdominal abscesses. In addition, our estimation of serum biomarkers revealed potential diagnostic aids for patients with acute abdominal pain."

    "title": "Patients' Surgical History Profile and Its Association With Complexity in Major Emergency Abdominal Surgery.",
    "abstract": "Emergency abdominal surgery often involves patients with a surgical history. Previous abdominal surgery can complicate new procedures. The correlation between surgical history and complexity in major emergency surgery has not been assessed. The purpose of this study was to profile patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery, regarding quantity and type of previous abdominal procedures and to assess their association with intraoperative complexity. We hypothesized that a history of abdominal surgery would be associated with increased intraoperative complexity, defined as a composite outcome of complicating factors and intraoperative events. We conducted an exploratory analysis of 754 consecutive patients undergoing major emergency abdominal surgery at a single institution. While multiple procedure- and patient-related variables were prospectively recorded in our local database, data on patient history and previous abdominal surgeries were collected retrospectively. Intraoperative iatrogenic lesions (unintended lesions to intra-abdominal organs), prolonged procedural time (≥3 h), or excessive intraoperative bleeding (≥1 L) were established as indicative of a complex procedure ('complexity factor'). Data were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression to identify significant preoperative risk factors for intraoperative complexity. A total of 754 patients were included, with a median age of 71 y (interquartile range: 58-79), and 51% of the cohort were female. Among them, 476 patients (61%) had a history of previous abdominal surgery. In 192 (25%) of the procedures, surgeons reported at least one complexity factor. Previous colonic or rectal resection was associated with intraoperative complexity (2.34 risk ratio, confidence interval 95: 1.01-5.41, P = 0.05). Other significant factors were prior laparotomy, severe intra-abdominal adhesions, previous intra-abdominal abscess, and prior small bowel obstruction. This study profiles emergency surgical patients with a history of abdominal surgery and explores the associations between previous surgery and complexity in subsequent procedures. Awareness of factors associated with increased procedural complexity is valuable to the surgical and anesthesiologic team in the planning of the procedure."

Her multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) images showed peri-gastric fat stranding on MDCT, corresponding to the extra-gastric wall inflammation due to gastric perforation. Laparoscopic surgery was successfully performed to remove the extra-gastric foreign body and repair the perforation with the lesser omentum. To the best of our knowledge, the literature review showed that this is the 10th case of gastric perforation due to a foreign body treated by laparoscopy. The fat stranding is considered indicative of gastric perforation, and laparoscopy must be prepared when gastroscopy fails to remove and save the gastric perforation."

    "abstract": "Peritoneal pseudocysts are benign, fluid-filled structures that arise from the accumulation of intra-abdominal fluid, which would typically be reabsorbed by the peritoneum. These pseudocysts form when peritoneal integrity is disrupted by adhesions, often secondary to trauma, surgery, or infection. While intraperitoneal pseudocysts are rare, they are most frequently associated with inflammatory processes, including ventriculoperitoneal shunt complications, catheter-related infections. Sclerosing peritonitis (SP), a rare but serious complication of long-term continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, is characterized by marked thickening of the peritoneal membranes. Histologically, these membranes consist of dense fibrotic connective tissue infiltrated by mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells. The pathogenesis of SP-associated pseudocysts is thought to involve low-grade infection or localized chronic inflammation. A 59-year-old male on peritoneal dialysis presented to the emergency department with chronic abdominal pain. Computed tomography imaging revealed a large peritoneal pseudocyst. During exploratory midline laparotomy, the pseudocyst was successfully evacuated, and the peritoneal dialysis catheter was removed."

    "abstract": "A negative appendectomy is a surgery performed due to a clinical suspicion of acute appendicitis, but no evidence of inflammation is identified upon examination. The main reason is the incorrect diagnosis of acute appendicitis, which remains a challenge, especially in developing countries, where the rates are different among populations. This study aims to explore the prevalence of negative appendectomies in a regional hospital and evaluate the diagnostic methods used in clinical practice. A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients who underwent emergency appendectomy between 2021 and 2022. Negative appendectomy was defined as the absence of histopathological evidence of acute appendicitis postoperatively. Out of 324 patients, 38 were found to have undergone a negative appendectomy, representing a two-year rate of 11.7%. Imaging was performed in 78% of cases, but no significant difference was observed in its use between patients with positive and negative appendectomies. Differential diagnoses showed pathologies such as cysts and intestinal lesions. The Alvarado score was found to be a useful tool when applied with a threshold score of 7. However, variability in clinical presentations such as nausea/vomiting, anorexia, right iliac fossa tenderness and fever highlighted the limitations of relying solely on this metric. The factors associated with negative appendectomy were previous abdominal surgery, Alvarado score <7, abdominal pain, rebound tenderness, leukocytosis and neutrophilia. The prevalence of negative appendectomies at our institution was 11.7%. Despite the widespread use of diagnostic imaging and clinical scoring systems, improvements in diagnostic accuracy are necessary to reduce the rate of unnecessary surgeries."

Typically, electrolyte derangements are managed by direct repletion, volume status correction, or hemodialysis; however, the persistence of electrolyte abnormalities despite utilizing appropriate initial strategies requires further investigation. A 72-year-old male presented to the emergency department with weakness 2 months post-exploratory laparotomy with ileostomy for small bowel perforation complicated by intra-abdominal infection. The patient was treated for sepsis and imaging revealed intra-abdominal and abdominal wall abscesses. After drainage, recovery was complicated by treatment of refractory hypomagnesemia in the context of zinc supplementation. If initial electrolyte repletion measures do not provide the intended benefit, investigating secondary causes of refractory electrolyte abnormalities is necessary. While hypomagnesemia is one of the least common electrolyte derangements seen within the general acute care hospital setting, in facilities with relatively high volumes of bariatric or gastrointestinal surgical patients, keeping the phenomenon of zinc-induced hypomagnesemia in mind becomes more crucial due to its frequent use in those settings. This case highlights the effects of excess high-dose zinc supplementation in a patient without zinc deficiency in the postoperative period who developed treatment-resistant hypomagnesemia due to zinc-induced impairment of magnesium absorption as well as gastrointestinal and renal losses. Zinc supplementation can cause hypomagnesemia."

However, if the fish bone perforates the pharyngeal wall or the gastrointestinal wall and migrates to the neck tissues or organs, entering the lungs, mediastinum, heart, liver, biliary tract, spleen, pancreas, or other structures, or damages major blood vessels in the thoracic or abdominal cavities, it can lead to severe complications. This condition is rare and dangerous, potentially resulting in a series of serious complications, including neck abscess, thyroid abscess, thrombosis or air embolism of the cervical vessels, esophageal perforation, rupture of major mediastinal vessels, mediastinitis, aorto-esophageal fistula, lung abscess, spinal injury, sepsis, splenic abscess, hepatic abscess, anal fistula, and it may even be misdiagnosed as a tumor. This narrative review synthesizes evidence on fish bone translocation complications to (1) identify high-risk clinical presentations, (2) guide site-specific imaging selection, and (3) inform multidisciplinary management strategies. Use the keyword \"fishbone\" to systematically search articles from PubMed、CNKI and Embase databases from 1972 to 2024. Review all original articles and include them in this review where appropriate. This narrative review synthesizes evidence from case reports and observational studies to explore complications and management of fish bone translocation in uncommon sites. Given the predominance of heterogeneous case reports, a formal systematic review with meta-analysis was not feasible; however, we employed systematic search strategies to minimize selection bias. To avoid severe complications, it is crucial to provide comprehensive information on the management of fish bone impaction. When fish bone removal cannot be achieved using laryngoscopy, prompt and decisive surgical intervention is required to extract the foreign body."

The cause of dyspnea was identified for 258 cats, representing 83% of the cases. This study focused solely on these 258 cats. Respiratory causes accounted for 33% of cases, followed by cardiac causes (25%) and both traumatic and neoplastic causes (21% each). Pleural effusion was present in 39% of the cats, with various origins: cardiac (38%), respiratory (pyothorax, feline infectious peritonitis, 30%), neoplastic (23%), and traumatic (9%). Male cats were significantly overrepresented in the cardiac and respiratory groups. The median age differed according to the cause (2 years for traumatic causes, 6 years for respiratory causes, and approximately 11 years for cardiac and neoplastic causes). Cats with cardiac disease were significantly more often hypothermic. Hyperthermia was not systematically indicative of an infectious process. No clinical element (temperature, heart rate, cardiac auscultation, etc.) allowed for predicting the cause of dyspnea. In-hospital mortality was 44%, varying according to the cause (78% for neoplastic causes, 40% for traumatic causes, 37% for cardiac causes, and 30% for respiratory causes). In conclusion, the four main categories of causes were represented in approximately equal proportions, which contrasts with the results of the British RAPID CAT study, where cardiac causes accounted for nearly two-thirds of dyspnea cases. In the dyspneic cats in this series, the clinical presentation did not allow clinicians to identify a particular cause. This highlights the importance of non-invasive examinations such as POCUS (point-of-care ultrasound), which has become a routine test in emergency medicine. However, this importance should not lead to underestimating the continued value of radiography when the cat's clinical condition allows for image acquisition."

    "title": "Trends in Clinical Outcomes After Major Emergency Abdominal Surgery in Denmark, Data From 2002-2022.",
    "abstract": "Major emergency abdominal surgery is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Understanding trends in outcomes over time can reveal critical practice-changing improvements, identify gaps in postoperative care, and establish a large-scale benchmark for future research. To investigate trends in morbidity and mortality after major emergency abdominal surgery in Denmark. This was a nationwide, population-based cohort study. Analyses were performed based on data from Danish nationwide administrative registries. Within the public health care system in Denmark, all adult patients undergoing major emergency abdominal surgery from 2002 to 2022 were included. Major emergency abdominal surgeries included laparotomy or laparoscopy due to intra-abdominal pathologies, including intestinal perforation, ischemia, bowel obstruction, abscess, or bleeding. Major emergency abdominal surgery. The primary outcome was the trend in 30- and 90-day mortality after major emergency abdominal surgery over time. A total of 61 476 patients (mean [SD] age, 66.2 [16.3] years; 34 827 female [56.7%]) were included. The annual number of surgeries remained constant, with a mean (SD) of 3044 (165) surgeries per year. The 30- and 90-day mortality was reduced from 25% and 33%, respectively, to 13% and 18%, respectively (P < .001). Median (IQR) hospital length of stay was decreased from 10 (5-17) days to 6 (4-13) days (P < .001). The rate of 30-day postoperative complications (classified Clavien-Dindo ≥3a) was reduced from 49% to 44% (P <.001) and the 90-day rate was reduced from 53% to 48% (P <.001), however, with a tendency toward more patients undergoing earlier intervention. The 30- and 90-day readmission rate increased drastically from 9% and 13%, respectively, to 25% and 33%, respectively (P < .001). Results of this cohort study suggest notable reductions in mortality and hospital length of stay after major emergency abdominal surgery. A marked increased readmission rate and a persistently high rate of postoperative complications were found. These shifts underscore the need for enhanced postoperative monitoring and postdischarge follow-up."

We report a case of an internal hernia and strangulated ileus caused by a bladder wall defect that occurred due to bladder rupture, which served as the hernia orifice. The patient was a woman in her 70s who had undergone radical hysterectomy and postoperative radiation therapy for cervical cancer 37 years prior. She was diagnosed with a strangulated ileus and underwent emergency surgery for abdominal pain. Intraoperative findings revealed moderate amounts of clear yellow ascites and a bladder wall defect with small intestinal incarceration, leading to a strangulated ileus. The strangulated bowel was resected and the bladder wall was trimmed and sutured. A histological examination of the trimmed bladder wall revealed findings consistent with late complications of radiation cystitis. Bladder rupture is characterized by nonspecific findings, making the diagnosis difficult. It is often diagnosed during surgery for acute abdomen. In this case, the small intestine was incarcerated at the bladder rupture site, causing strangulated ileus, a previously unreported condition. Although rare, bladder rupture should be considered a cause of strangulated ileus in the pelvic region."

    "abstract": "Gallstone ileus (GSI) is an unusual complication of cholelithiasis resulting from the formation of a fistula between the gallbladder and the gastrointestinal tract. When a sufficiently large gallstone passes into the bowel, it can obstruct a narrowed segment. The most common site of GSI is the terminal ileum, typically presenting as small bowel obstruction. However, a rare but potentially serious complication of calculous cholecystitis is gallstone sigmoid ileus, which can cause large bowel obstruction. This report presents the case of a 59-year-old woman who exhibited symptoms of large bowel obstruction caused by a large gallstone lodged in the sigmoid colon, along with a simultaneous large gallstone in the cecum, as revealed by multiplanar abdominopelvic CT. Both gallstones had migrated from the gallbladder to the large bowel through a cholecystoduodenal fistula. Initial conservative and endoscopic management attempts were unsuccessful, leading to the need for emergency surgery. Ultimately, the patient made a full recovery."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is the most common condition necessitating emergency abdominal surgery. While most cases are localized, 20% become complicated, resulting in perforation. The management of non-complicated appendicitis varies across medical centers, encompassing both surgical and non-surgical options, whereas complicated appendicitis is predominantly managed surgically. Differentiating them is clinically challenging, especially in pediatric patients, crucial for guiding appropriate treatment strategies. Therefore, there is an unmet need for biomarkers to distinguish the two entities. Here we examined the utility of epigenetic liquid biopsies in appendicitis. We used DNA methylation markers specific to immune and gastrointestinal epithelial cells to assess the tissue origins of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in appendicitis patients. Appendix epithelium cfDNA was undetected in plasma samples from children with appendicitis relative to control groups. In contrast, neutrophil and regulatory T-cell cfDNA were elevated in appendicitis enhancing the specificity and sensitivity of appendicitis diagnosis beyond the information provided by neutrophil counts. Notably, eosinophil cfDNA was most significantly elevated in children with perforated compared with non-perforated appendicitis. This finding was cross-validated using a machine-learning approach. In conclusion, eosinophil cfDNA levels are elevated in children with a perforated appendix and may have potential as a non-invasive aid in diagnosing perforated appendicitis in the future."

Its diagnosis is challenging due to the upward displacement of the ovary in advanced pregnancy, which can mimic other surgical emergencies like appendicitis or pyelonephritis. A 27-year-old woman, G1P0 at 23 weeks of gestation, presented with acute pelvic associated with vomiting. Clinical and ultrasound findings revealed a right ovarian torsion on a 60 × 40 mm dermoid cyst. A laparotomy was performed, showing two twists of the ovarian pedicle without ischemia, and a cystectomy was completed, the pregnancy continued to term without complications. Adnexal torsion is a rare emergency in pregnancy), often linked to ovarian pathology like dermoid cysts, as in our cases. Diagnosis is challenging due to nonspecific symptoms and anatomical changes during pregnancy, with ultrasound as the primary tool and MRI for additional precision. Management depends on gestational age and adnexal viability, with laparoscopy favored before 17 weeks and laparotomy for advanced pregnancies. Adnexal torsion is difficult to diagnose in pregnancy due to nonspecific symptoms. Prompt diagnostic laparoscopy, following safety guidelines, is crucial for persistent pain unresponsive to treatment to avoid delays."

In this report, we describe the case of a 67-year-old male with a history of endoscopic submucosal dissection who had metachronous superficial esophageal cancer. Although endoscopic submucosal dissection was attempted for challenging lesions adjacent to the scar, perforations occurred during the procedure. We placed an esophageal fully covered self-expandable metallic stent at the perforation site to avoid emergency surgery after lesion removal. However, stent migration and displacement concerns remained, as no stenosis was observed in the esophagus. Therefore, a clip with a thread on the upper edge of the stent was placed, and this anchoring clip was useful in preventing stent migration and closing the perforation. The patient improved with conservative treatment. In conclusion, the stent placement and anchoring method with clip and thread could be a treatment option in such cases."

This study introduces an innovative approach by integrating clinical, laboratory, and imaging features with advanced machine-learning techniques to enhance diagnostic accuracy in pediatric appendicitis. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 782 pediatric patients from the Regensburg Pediatric Appendicitis Data set. Clinical scores, laboratory markers, and imaging findings were analyzed. Statistical comparisons were performed using independent t-tests and χ 2 tests, with significance set at p < 0.05. Predictive models, including logistic regression and machine learning classifiers, were developed and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Significant differences were observed in clinical scores (e.g., Alvarado Score and Pediatric Appendicitis Score) and laboratory markers (e.g., WBC count and neutrophil percentage) between appendicitis (AA) and non-appendicitis (Non-AA) groups (p < 0.001). Imaging features, including appendix diameter, also demonstrated diagnostic value. Among predictive models, the Random Forest classifier achieved the highest accuracy (94.5%), with strong precision (93.8%) and recall (95.2%) for appendicitis diagnosis. This study represents a novel application of machine learning models, particularly Random Forest, to enhance diagnostic accuracy for pediatric appendicitis. The integration of clinical, laboratory, and imaging features offers a comprehensive and precise diagnostic framework. Further validation in diverse populations is recommended."

    "abstract": "Although conservative treatment and laparoscopic surgery are becoming increasingly popular for acute appendicitis, emergency open appendectomy is still performed in many situations. The purpose of this study was to examine the surgical outcomes of emergency open appendectomy for acute appendicitis. Between July 2008 and August 2022, 2,268 patients who underwent emergency open appendectomy for acute appendicitis were enrolled in this study. Of these patients, 417 (18.4%) had complicated appendicitis (CA), and 1,851 (81.6%) had uncomplicated appendicitis (UA). Clinical characteristics and both surgical and postoperative outcomes were compared between the groups. The percentage of CA patients increased after 2020, and by age, the proportion was greater for those aged 50 and older. In the CA group, patients were older (55.5 vs 30.0 years, p<0.001) and had more comorbidities (34% vs 12%, p<0.001). Additionally, in the CA group, the operation time was longer (86 vs 55 min, p<0.001), and the rate of postoperative complications was greater (16% vs 3.0%, p<0.001). There was one mortality in the CA group due to postoperative cerebral infarction. The postoperative hospital stay was significantly longer in the CA group (9 vs 5 days, p<0.001). In conclusion, in the CA group, the patients were older and had more comorbidities. Patients who underwent emergency open appendectomy for CA had longer operation times and more complications. This large single-center study provides insights into emergency open appendectomy for acute appendicitis and useful information in terms of comparisons with other treatment modalities, such as laparoscopic appendectomy and elective appendectomy."

    "abstract": "Uterine broad ligament hernia is a rare cause of bowel obstruction in women, often challenging to diagnose preoperatively. We report a case of a 73-year-old woman presenting with abdominal pain and vomiting. CT imaging revealed an incarcerated small bowel loop within the Douglas pouch, with displacement of the uterus, leading to a diagnosis of strangulated bowel obstruction due to a broad ligament hernia. An emergency laparotomy identified an ileal segment trapped in a defect of the left broad ligament. The bowel appeared ischemic, but intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging confirmed adequate perfusion, allowing for preservation without resection. The hernial defect was repaired, and the patient recovered without complications. This case highlights the importance of early CT diagnosis and the utility of ICG fluorescence imaging in assessing bowel viability, aiding surgical decision-making, and preventing unnecessary resection in cases of prolonged strangulation."

However, some foreign bodies can cause gastrointestinal perforation, leading to severe complications. Fish bone-induced gastrointestinal perforation is relatively common in regions with high fish consumption, but appendiceal perforation remains extremely rare and diagnostically challenging. We report a case of a 76-year-old male patient who presented with worsening lower abdominal pain. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a swollen appendix (16 mm) with a high-density area and surrounding fat stranding, confirming acute appendicitis caused by appendicolith. Emergency laparoscopic appendectomy revealed a markedly swollen appendix with a central perforation. A 10-mm wedge-shaped fish bone was identified within the appendiceal lumen, confirming fish bone-induced perforated appendicitis. Histopathological examination confirmed severe inflammation with focal necrosis. Postoperative multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) images revealed a wedge-shaped hyperdense linear structure within the appendix, which was identified as a fish bone. Fish bone-induced perforated appendicitis is a rare but important differential diagnosis in regions with high fish consumption. A detailed dietary history and careful review of MPR images on CT are essential for accurate preoperative diagnosis. Early recognition and laparoscopic surgical intervention can prevent severe complications and improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common surgical emergency associated with substantial morbidity, hospital length of stay (LOS), and healthcare cost. The World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) Bologna guidelines provide evidence-informed recommendations for managing adhesive SBO, promoting timely surgical intervention (or non-operative management (NOM) when ischaemia, strangulation, or peritonitis are absent). However, guideline adoption and its impact on outcomes remain under studied. Compliance with the Bologna guidelines was evaluated to determine the impact of compliance on outcomes. SnapSBO, a prospective, multicentre, time-bound, observational cohort study, captured data on patients with adhesive SBO across diverse healthcare settings and patient populations. Patient care was categorized into: successful NOM, surgery after an unsuccessful appropriate trial of NOM (NOM-T), and direct to surgery (DTS). Compliance with diagnostic, therapeutic, and postoperative Bologna guideline recommendations was assessed as either complete or partial. Primary outcomes included adherence to the Bologna guidelines, LOS, complications, and the incidence of the composite metric 'optimal outcomes' (LOS ≤5 days, discharge without complications, and no readmission within 30 days). Among 982 patients with adhesive SBO, successful NOM occurred in 561 (57.1%), 224 (22.8%) underwent NOM-T, and 197 (20.1%) proceeded DTS. The mean(s.d.) LOS was 5.3(9.0), 12.9(11.4), and 7.7(8.0) days respectively (P < 0.001). Optimal outcomes were achieved in 61.0%, 16.1%, and 37.6% respectively (P < 0.001) and full guideline compliance was observed in 17.2%, 10.1%, and 0.4% respectively. Patients with adhesive SBO whose care was aligned with the Bologna guidelines had a shorter LOS and a greater incidence of optimal outcomes. Addressing evidence-to-practice gaps through implementation strategies that consider contextual factors will enhance guideline adoption and patient outcomes. Small bowel obstruction happens when the intestine becomes blocked, often due to scar tissue from previous surgery. It is a common reason people are admitted to hospitals for emergency surgery worldwide. Doctors have created clear guidelines (expert advice) on how best to treat this condition to improve patient outcomes. This study looked at whether doctors follow these guidelines and how it affects patient results. Researchers found that hospitals frequently struggle to fully follow the guidelines because they lack necessary resources or due to differences in medical practices. Improving how closely doctors follow these guidelines could help patients recover faster and experience fewer complications."

He was intubated prior to arrival and had bilateral tube thoracostomies placed shortly after arrival. After stabilization, computed tomography (CT) of the head, cervical spine, chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed, and he was found to have an acute colonic perforation, which resulted in extensive subcutaneous emphysema that mimicked the presumed traumatic injury on presentation. This case highlights the importance of keeping a broad differential diagnosis in patients with extensive subcutaneous emphysema. In this case, the patient presented with a presumed acute traumatic injury, though he was ultimately diagnosed with acute colonic perforation."

This study investigates the real-world outcomes of patients with occlusive arterial AMI undergoing surgery, focusing on predictors of short-term mortality. A retrospective, single-center analysis was conducted on patients undergoing emergent mesenteric surgery for occlusive arterial AMI between January 2015 and May 2024. The primary outcome was 30-day survival; secondary outcomes included predictors of in-hospital mortality based on preoperative laboratory parameters. Sixty patients (mean age 75 ± 12 years) were included, with a 30-day survival rate of 45%. Of the 60 patients, 15 (75%) with acute-on-chronic symptoms (n = 20) survived, compared to 12 (30%) with acute onset (n = 40) (P = 0.003). Multivariate Cox regression identified lactate, bicarbonate (HCO3), the HCO3-to-lactate ratio, and neutrophil count as predictors of 30-day mortality. The HCO3-to-lactate ratio ≤10 demonstrated high predictive accuracy (area under the curve 0.832, sensitivity 90.6%, specificity 75%). In acute-onset cases, excluding acute-on-chronic symptoms improved specificity to 100%. The HCO3-to-lactate ratio is a robust prognostic marker in occlusive arterial AMI, reflecting both tissue hypoperfusion and impaired metabolic compensation. These findings support its potential utility in risk stratification and in guiding clinical decision-making in the emergent management of AMI."

    "abstract": "Background: Retrobulbar block is a popular regional anesthetic technique in modern eye surgery due to its excellent anesthetic properties and the provision of globe akinesia. Severe complications including inadvertent subarachnoidal injection, expulsive retrobulbar hemorrhage, and intoxication with local anesthetic, are very rare. However, most reports date back several decades, mechanisms of action are not fully understood, and in recent years the procedure has changed towards facilitating the retrobulbar injection by a brief analgosedation. We therefore describe a case with inadvertent brainstem anesthesia after retrobulbar block concealed behind an analgosedation and provide cCT (cranial computed tomography) images with characteristic pathological findings. Therapy and outcome: A man in his mid-60´s presenting with retinal detachment was scheduled for surgery. After uneventful retrobulbar injection under brief analgosedation, a severe increase of blood pressure and tachycardia occurred while unconsciousness (originally induced by analgosedation) persisted. Hemodynamic alterations were treated with betablockers and antihypertensive agents, and the patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated. The diagnostic workup revealed a dural fissure with intracranial air in the cCT-scan compatible with a perforation of the dura and accidental injection of local anesthetics into the subarachnoidal space. The patient was kept intubated on ICU throughout the respiratory depression and fully recovered without neurological deficits. The vitreoretinal procedure was performed under general anesthesia 36 h after the event. Conclusion: Albeit rare, inadvertent brainstem anesthesia remains a serious adverse event of retrobulbar block. As an important aspect, analgosedation may mask the typical clinical signs making the diagnostic work-up challenging. Furthermore, for the first time we present radiographic imaging findings providing insightful evidence for a possible mechanism of action. Serious complications, such as prolonged hypoxia with potential neurological damage, can successfully prevented by ensuring the presence of a fully equipped and skilled anesthetic team throughout the regional anesthetic procedure."

Previous ENETS guidelines proposed standards for the surgery of SI-NEN, which should be followed to provide long-term disease-free survival. To analyze the results of reintervention for locoregional SI-NEN (stages I-III) after suboptimal initial resection. Perioperative characteristics of all patients who underwent surgical reintervention after suboptimal initial resection (SIR) of locoregional SI-NEN were retrieved from a prospective database. Patient characteristics, initial and redo procedures, imaging before reintervention, pathological results of SIR, and after reintervention, including missed primary tumors and lymph node metastases, were retrospectively analyzed. During a 15 years period, 21 of 93 (22%) patients had surgical reinterventions after SIR. In 20 of 21 (95%) cases, the initial resection was performed outside an ENETS center of excellence. Ten (48%) of those cases were emergency operations because of the bowel obstruction or bowel bleeding. Seven SIR (33%) cases were performed laparoscopically, and in another 5 (24%) cases, a complete endoscopic mucosa resection was performed. Imaging before reintervention visualized residual disease in 15 of 21 (71%) patients. Surgical reintervention included either lymphadenectomy alone (LAD, n = 3) or small bowel resection plus systematic LAD (n = 12) or right hemicolectomy/ileocecal resection with systematic LAD (n = 6), respectively. In 19 of 21 (90%) patients, a R0 resection could be achieved. One patient (5%) experienced postoperative clinically relevant complications. According to pathology, in 10 (48%) patients lymph node metastases, in 6 (29%) patients additional primary tumors, and in 5 (24%) patients, both lymph nodes metastases and primary tumors were left behind in the SIR. After mean follow-up of 52 months, 16 (76%) of 21 patients were free of disease, 4 (19%) patients were alive with disease, and 1 patient deceased of an unrelated cause. The proposed standards to resect locoregional SI-NEN should be followed to avoid SIR, although the prognosis after adequate surgical reintervention is good."

Advanced imaging techniques such as multidetector CT (MDCT) quickly provide detailed 3D images with high spatial resolution, making it ideal for rapid assessment of a variety of esophageal pathologies. This pictorial essay presents 10 illustrative cases to highlight the clinical applications of MDCT and its critical role in diagnosing conditions like perforation, foreign body impaction, inflammatory or infectious esophagitis, achalasia, fistulae, and neoplasms. Optimized CT protocols, such as contrast-enhanced imaging and advanced postprocessing techniques like maximum intensity projection (MIP) images and volumetric rendering technique (VRT), in addition to 3D cinematic rendering, are crucial in improving diagnostic accuracy and enhancing visualization of anatomical structures. The cases presented emphasize the importance of early detection and timely management of esophageal conditions, as small delays can lead to significantly increased morbidity and mortality. Ultimately, a multidisciplinary approach that coordinates clinical, radiological, and pathological evaluations ensures appropriate management and improved patient outcomes in esophageal emergencies."

    "abstract": "Mitral valve closure is a complex process and requires coordinated actions of all its interrelated anatomical components: the left atrium, the mitral annulus, the valve leaflets, the tendinous chordae, and the papillary muscles with its surrounding left ventricular wall for an effective mitral valve closure. Research of last three-decades has shown that the mitral annulus starts contracting during atrial systole which significantly prevent early mitral regurgitation (MR). MR can be acute or chronic, and primary, or secondary or mixed; their etiologies, mechanisms and natural progression are very different and have clinical implications. A leaflet perforation, a rupture of chorda tendinea or papillary muscle and a torn leaflet after balloon mitral valvotomy can result in acute severe MR. The patients of acute severe MR present in pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock and often need urgent surgical intervention. Primary MR is a disease of the mitral valve apparatus and secondary to valve degeneration, whereas secondary MR is a disease of the left ventricle secondary to coronary artery disease and dilated cardiomyopathy. The other causes of secondary MR include mitral annular dilation secondary to atrial fibrillation and restrictive cardiomyopathy, dys-synchrony due to bundle branch block, right ventricular pacing and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The treatment strategy differs for primary and various subsets of secondary MR; hence, a thorough knowledge of the etiology, mechanisms and pathogenesis of MR is necessary to select appropriate management strategy and to decide when to intervene. The review discusses the mechanisms, and pathophysiology in acute, chronic, primary and secondary MR."

    "abstract": "This case report presents a rare complication of a massive Type IV hiatal hernia occurring through a diaphragmatic relaxing incision (DRI) created during a previous Nissen fundoplication. An 82-year-old female presented with abdominal pain, shortness of breath, and small bowel obstruction. Imaging revealed herniation of the small bowel, colon, and spleen through a diaphragmatic defect. Seven years prior, the patient underwent a Nissen fundoplication with mesh repair, during which bilateral DRIs were created to reduce diaphragmatic tension. Despite prior concerns about operative risks, emergent surgery was performed to reduce the hernia and resect infarcted bowel. Postoperative recovery was complicated by hypotension requiring vasopressor support, but the patient ultimately recovered well. This case highlights the potential for catastrophic herniation through DRIs and underscores the need for careful surgical technique and postoperative surveillance. Literature review suggests that more focused research is needed to establish optimal management and prevention strategies for this complication."

However, in cases of situs inversus totalis (SIT), the atypical anatomical positioning can obscure the clinical picture and lead to diagnostic uncertainty, often mimicking other left-sided pathologies and potentially resulting in delayed treatment and complications. This case report presents the surgical challenges encountered during an appendicectomy in a patient with SIT, emphasizing the importance of thorough preoperative imaging and meticulous intraoperative navigation. A nine-year-old boy with no prior history of SIT presented with left iliac fossa pain, fever, and vomiting - symptoms consistent with acute appendicitis. Clinical examination and diagnostic workup, including laboratory tests, abdominal ultrasound, and echocardiogram, confirmed an inflamed appendix located in the left lower quadrant with dextrocardia. Given the altered anatomical configuration, a laparoscopic appendicectomy was performed with particular attention to the reversed anatomy. The procedure was completed successfully, and the patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery. Although rare, documenting such cases in detail is essential to enhance clinical awareness and guide effective management. Increasing familiarity with LSAA in SIT can help reduce diagnostic delays and surgical complications while contributing to the broader understanding of rare anatomical variants in surgical practice."

    "title": "Spontaneous Gallbladder Perforation in a Patient With Osteogenesis Imperfecta Type III: A Rare Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), also known as brittle bone disease, is an inherited connective tissue disorder (CTD) characterized by recurrent fractures, low bone mass, skeletal deformity, and variable short stature. Gallbladder perforation (GBP) is a rare but serious complication of acute cholecystitis, associated with high morbidity and mortality due to diagnostic delays in both calculous and acalculous cases. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for spontaneous ischemic GBP in patients with CTDs such as OI Type III. A 20-year-old woman with severe OI type III presented to the emergency department with a two-day history of abdominal pain and distension. Abdominal computed tomography revealed free intraperitoneal air anterior to the liver and adjacent to the falciform ligament, which was suggestive of GBP. No gallstones or sludge were identified within the gallbladder lumen. An emergent open cholecystectomy was performed. Intraoperative findings revealed a concealed perforation at the gallbladder fundus. Due to dense adhesions and the inability to achieve the critical view of safety, a partial cholecystectomy was performed to reduce the risk of biliary and vascular injury. OI poses significant clinical challenges, including abnormal coagulation, airway obstruction, cardiovascular complications, and delayed wound healing. The patient recovered without complications and was discharged on the seventh postoperative day, remaining asymptomatic during the three-month follow-up period. This case demonstrates that GBP, though rare, should be considered a potential complication in patients with CTDs such as OI Type III. Early recognition and appropriate management are crucial for improving clinical outcomes."

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted healthcare delivery worldwide, including bariatric surgery. While revisional procedures remained essential for weight recurrence and complications, practice patterns evolved during different phases of the pandemic. To evaluate the effect of COVID-19 on revisional bariatric procedures by comparing trends across pandemic (2020), vaccination rollout (2021), and postpandemic (2022) periods. Analysis of the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) database, United States. Retrospective analysis of 72,189 bariatric surgeries (of which 55,854 conversions and 16,335 revisions) from 2020 to 2022. Outcomes included surgical volume, indications, complications, and mortality. Of 609,240 bariatric procedures, 72,189 (11.8%) were revisional or conversion procedures, with conversions representing 9.2% (55,854) and revisions 2.7% (16,335). The combined proportion remained stable (12.1%, 12.1%, 11.5%, P < .001), but urgent revision rates were higher during the pandemic (3.1% versus 2.2% versus 1.8%, P < .001). Pandemic-era cases focused on severe complications (fistula, perforation, stricture), shifting postpandemic toward weight recurrence and reflux. Sleeve-to-bypass conversions increased from 41.2% to 53.6%. Serious complications were highest in 2020-2021 (6.6%, 6.4%) compared to 2022 (5.8%, P < .001), while mortality remained unchanged (.15%). The study demonstrates distinct trends throughout pandemic periods, reflecting Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance on surgical urgency . While complication rates were slightly higher during the pandemic, procedures remained safe with stable mortality. Postpandemic shifts toward elective indications and increasing conversion procedures suggest adaptation to accumulated surgical needs."

Physical examination revealed peritonitis on abdominal examination. Laboratory examinations were concerning for sepsis. Contrast-enhanced CT of abdomen and pelvis was suspicious for ischaemic colitis and intra-abdominal abscess. In the setting of peritonitis, exploratory laparotomy was performed and found to have a spontaneous rupture of the uterine fundus causing purulent peritonitis. This was managed with the total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The patient had a challenging postoperative course complicated by acute kidney injury, congestive heart failure and failure to thrive. Palliative care was consulted for comfort, and she was discharged to hospice.Ruptured pyometra continues to be associated with high mortality despite early and aggressive management, particularly in patients who present with sepsis and organ failure. The diagnosis should be considered in the differential for elderly females who present with emergent surgical abdominal conditions."

Owing to its analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties, this method alleviates low back pain and often improves physical function through lumbar injection. Despite its therapeutic potential, the complications associated with ozone therapy are not yet fully understood. A 57-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus was admitted to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain and distension and chest pain, which occurred following her last session of ozone therapy. At first, the patient had been diagnosed with peritonitis based on initial symptoms. However, blood tests did not reveal any notable abnormalities. After identifying the presence of free air on the abdominal X-ray and the IV contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the abdomen revealed retroperitoneal and intraperitoneal air indicative of pneumoperitoneum and pneumoretroperitoneum. The patient was discharged in stable condition after five days of non-surgical and symptomatic treatment. This is a rare case of pneumoperitoneum and pneumoretroperitoneum, which also highlights a new complication of ozone therapy. Despite the exact pathophysiological mechanisms being unclear, the high pressure of ozone administration or technique may be the causative factors. Conservative management demonstrated favorable prognostic outcomes and an effective treatment response. Spontaneous pneumoperitoneum presents with severe abdominal pain and the presence of free air in the abdominal cavity. Typically, it does not require surgical intervention. However, Conservative treatment resulted in a dramatic improvement in the initial clinical condition and decreased the amount of free air within the abdominal cavity."

A 50-year-old male presented with a 12 h history of severe epigastric pain and vomiting. A contrast enhanced computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated gastric outlet obstruction and large bowel obstruction due to left paraduodenal hernia involving the distal transverse colon and gastric antrum. After resuscitation, a laparotomy was performed, the bowel was reduced, the mesocolic defect repaired, and small bowel mesentery widened. The large bowel was decompressed via the appendix stump. The post-operative recovery was unremarkable. Left paraduodenal hernia is a rare condition and where seen acutely, usually presents with small bowel obstruction. Here the patient presented with a large bowel obstruction, a rare presentation of this uncommon condition. Operative intervention is mandatory in the acute setting to prevent ischaemia and perforation from strangulation of the bowel."

    "abstract": "Introduction Recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rhsTM) is a therapeutic agent for sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and is reported to be associated with bleeding events. Although several studies on rhsTM have been reported, the safety and efficacy of rhsTM for sepsis-induced DIC after emergency laparotomy remain controversial. In this study, we aimed to investigate the efficacy, safety, and bleeding complications of rhsTM in patients with sepsis-induced DIC following emergency abdominal surgery. Methods In this retrospective observational study, we reviewed the data of patients who underwent emergency surgery for gastrointestinal necrosis and perforation and received rhsTM for sepsis-induced DIC at a single center between January 2014 and December 2023. We evaluated the incidence rate of bleeding complications associated with rhsTM treatment, clinical characteristics, and changes in Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM) DIC scores. Patients with DIC were identified as having the JAAM DIC diagnostic criteria (DIC score ≥4). Results We analyzed a total of 32 patients with sepsis-induced DIC. The APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) score at admission to the intensive care unit was 20. A total of 46.9% of the patients had poor renal function with CKD (chronic kidney disease), classified based on KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) stage 4 or higher, and 37.5% were on regular hemodialysis. A total of 59.4% of the patients received antithrombotic therapy. The JAAM DIC score was significantly ameliorated from the first day of rhsTM administration (5.3) to days 5-7 of rhsTM administration (3.3) (p < 0.0001). A total of 75% of the patients had a HAS-BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal Renal/Liver Function, Stroke, Bleeding History or Predisposition, Labile INR, Elderly, Drugs/Alcohol Use) score, an indicator of bleeding risk, of 3 or higher. The mortality rate in the whole cohort was 37.5%. Patients were also classified into the following groups: HAS-BLED score ≥3 (n = 24) and <3 (n = 8), and survivors (n = 20) and non-survivors (n = 12). No perioperative bleeding complications were observed. Conclusion rhsTM was not associated with an increased incidence of bleeding complications, even in patients with sepsis-induced DIC following emergency abdominal surgery and in critically ill patients with poor renal function or those receiving antithrombotic therapy. rhsTM is a safe and effective anticoagulant for the management of sepsis-induced DIC after emergency surgery and is clinically feasible."

    "abstract": "Identifying and managing malnourished emergency general surgery (EGS) patients can be difficult. There are many tools available, a range of barriers to overcome and variety of guidelines at a surgeon's disposal. This study aimed to determine the impact of key variables on surgeon preference to start nutritional support in EGS. A discrete choice experiment was used to determine the impact of six variables on surgeons' treatment preferences for commencing nutritional support in EGS. Twenty-five hypothetical scenarios regarding a patient with adhesional small bowel obstruction were disseminated electronically. Binomial logistic regression was used to identify significant associations. Ethical approval was obtained (UREC 050436). In all, 148 participants responded providing 3700 scenario responses. Completion rate was 52.1% (148/284) with an approximately even split of consultants and non-consultants (50.7% vs. 49.3%) and intestinal failure (IF) experience (46.6% experienced vs. 53.4% not experienced). Consultants favoured starting nutritional support (77.7%; 1443/1875) more often than non-consultants (71.8%; 1310/1825). Forming an anastomosis, hypoalbuminaemia, underweight (body mass index <18.5 kg/m2), unintentional weight loss (>10%), ≥5 days without oral intake until now and ≥5 days likely to be without oral intake from now were statistically more likely to be associated with treatment preference, but obesity (body mass index >30 kg/m2) was not. Overall, experience of IF (OR 1.093, 95% CI 0.732-1.631; P = 0.663) and seniority of surgeon (OR 0.711, 95% CI 0.473-1.068; P = 0.100) significantly influenced the results. There are many variables that impact the decision to start nutritional support in EGS, but seniority of the surgeon and IF experience do not."

    "abstract": "Esophageal perforation is a rare but deadly complication of cervical spine fractures. Early identification can be difficult but is imperative for proper treatment and prevention of life-threatening infection. Once diagnosed, surgical drainage and broad-spectrum antibiotics can yield positive outcomes. The authors present a successfully managed case of cervical spine fracture with associated esophageal perforation and necrotizing fasciitis as well as an extensive literature review. An 87-year-old male with a previous cervical laminectomy presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath after a ground-level fall. Initial CT imaging of the cervical spine was noted to have no abnormalities at the time, and the patient was sent home. Eight days later, he presented again with neck pain, spasm, overt hyperextension injury, and fracture of the C7 vertebra, which was seen on CT. Initial surgical fixation was aborted due to the discovery of necrotizing fasciitis resulting from esophageal perforation. After surgical repair, debridement, and antibiotics, the fracture was stabilized via C2-T3 posterior segmental instrumented fusion. Following a complex hospital course, the patient was ultimately discharged following inpatient rehabilitation at his neurological baseline. Esophageal perforation and necrotizing fasciitis from cervical spine injuries can be deadly if not diagnosed and managed early. A high level of suspicion should be maintained with disruption of the anterior column of the cervical spine. A combination of surgical and medical management can yield successful treatment. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE24720."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous rupture of the urinary bladder (SRUB) is a rare but life-threatening emergency that often presents with nonspecific symptoms, leading to delayed diagnosis and severe complications such as peritonitis, sepsis, and multi-organ failure. In rare cases, SRUB may present with multiorgan dysfunction including acute liver and kidney failure, complicating management and recovery. It is commonly associated with underlying bladder dysfunction, including chronic urinary retention and bladder outlet obstruction. We report a 58-year-old male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) who presented with acute abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, and hemodynamic instability. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis, renal impairment, metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalemia, as well as elevated bilirubin and liver enzyme levels. Abdominopelvic CT with cystography confirmed SRUB, showing contrast extravasation. The patient underwent an urgent exploratory laparotomy, which revealed two bladder tears that were successfully repaired. Postoperative care included broad-spectrum antibiotics, hemodialysis, and intensive monitoring, leading to a full recovery. SRUB is often misdiagnosed due to its resemblance to gastrointestinal and renal pathologies. This case highlights the importance of a high index of suspicion in patients with risk factors such as bladder outlet obstruction. CT cystography is crucial for early diagnosis, while surgical repair remains the gold standard for treatment. Supportive care, including hemodialysis and infection control, is vital for optimizing outcomes. Early recognition and prompt surgical intervention are critical in managing SRUB. Clinicians should consider this rare condition in patients with acute abdomen and known bladder dysfunction to reduce morbidity and improve prognosis."

    "abstract": "Since the advent of immunotherapy in clinical practice, it has profoundly transformed the paradigm of cancer treatment and has been rapidly adopted in clinical settings. Concurrently, the combination of immunotherapy with anti-angiogenic therapy has shown great promise in clinical research. The inevitable joint application brings about a greater number of adverse reactions. These adverse reactions are often perplexing, with the uncertainty of whether they stem from immunotherapy, anti-angiogenic therapy, or both. This is a case report of adverse reactions occurring when immune drugs and anti-vascular drugs are used together. This case is analyzed to provide a warning for adverse reactions in the clinical application of anti-angiogenic therapy combined with immunotherapy. A 52-year-old cervical cancer patient with metastases had abdominal pain and fever post-treatment with bevacizumab, pembrolizumab, and chemotherapy, suggesting intestinal perforation. After 2 chemotherapy cycles with bevacizumab and pembrolizumab, the patient had fever up to 39°C and abdominal pain. Exam showed tenderness, rigidity, and weak bowel sounds. Blood tests revealed leukocytosis and neutrophilia. Imaging indicated pneumoperitoneum and possible intestinal obstruction. Emergency laparotomy revealed a small intestine perforation with strictures, leading to resection and ileostomy due to edema. The postoperative recovery was good. We consider intestinal perforation caused by bevacizumab. Therefore, the patient was subsequently discontinued from bevacizumab and continued to receive paclitaxel, cisplatin and pembrolizumab. At present, the patient has finished chemotherapy and is receiving pembrolizumab maintenance therapy with no significant gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Anti-angiogenic drugs and immunotherapy drugs each have their own side effects, and the occurrence of adverse reactions becomes more complex when used in combination. In the clinical process of combined medication, more attention should be paid to adverse reactions, early identification of severe adverse reactions, and active management."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common pediatric surgical emergency requiring timely intervention. Conventional three-port laparoscopic appendectomy (CLA) is widely used, offering reduced postoperative pain, faster recovery, and lower wound infection rates. The transumbilical laparoscopic-assisted appendectomy (TULAA) technique, a single-incision approach, promises improved cosmetic outcomes, shorter operative time, and reduced morbidity. This study aims to compare TULAA and CLA in terms of surgical efficiency, postoperative pain, complications, hospital stay, conversion rate, and cosmetic acceptance. This comparative study was conducted at Shri B.M. Patil Medical College, Vijayapura, India, from September 2023 to September 2024. A total of 36 patients under 18 years with appendicitis were enrolled (18 in the TULAA group and 18 in the CLA group). Primary outcomes assessed included operative time, pain (using visual analogue scale, or VAS), complications, wound issues, hospital stay, conversion rate, and cosmetic acceptance. TULAA demonstrated a significantly shorter operative time (p<0.001) and lower postoperative pain (p=0.0009) compared to CLA. Hospital stay was shorter in the TULAA group (p=0.0008). While no significant difference in postoperative complications (p=0.1456) was observed, cosmetic acceptance was notably better in TULAA (p<0.001). TULAA is a quick, safe, and cosmetically superior alternative to CLA in pediatric appendicitis, offering shorter operative time, reduced pain, and enhanced recovery."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Effusive-constrictive pericarditis (ECP) is a rare pediatric condition linked to infections, autoimmune disorders, or post-surgical complications. Appendicitis, a common abdominal emergency, rarely causes systemic inflammation affecting distant organs. We report a unique case of chronic appendicitis with an appendicolith leading to ECP and hepatic fibrosis, necessitating extensive diagnostic evaluation and surgical interventions. CASE REPORT A 14.5-year-old boy presented with progressive dyspnea, reduced exercise tolerance, low-grade fever, and intermittent abdominal pain. Examination revealed hepatomegaly and systemic inflammation. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis, elevated inflammatory markers, and mild liver enzyme abnormalities. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a large pericardial effusion with tamponade, prompting urgent pericardiocentesis. CT identified a calcified appendicolith, but appendectomy was deferred to prioritize pericardial management. Pericardiocentesis provided partial relief. Persistent symptoms and further imaging confirmed pericarditis, leading to a subtotal pericardiectomy. Histology revealed chronic fibrotic pericarditis without infection. The patient improved significantly postoperatively but returned 6 weeks later with acute abdominal pain and fever. Imaging confirmed a perforated appendix with an abscess. Appendectomy led to complete resolution of symptoms, normalization of inflammatory markers, and improvement in hepatic and cardiac function. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the diagnostic complexity of atypical appendicitis with systemic involvement. Recognizing abdominal pathologies as potential sources of systemic inflammation is vital, especially in refractory cases. Early intervention in the primary source can prevent severe complications and improve outcomes."

    "abstract": "In veterinary medicine, the qSOFA model has been studied in patients with conditions such as peritonitis or pyometra, and among the modified qSOFA models, only the qSOFA-lactate model has been researched. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of q-SOFA-C-reactive protein (CRP), qSOFA-lactate, and quick systemic inflammatory response syndrome (qSIRS) models for triaging emergency and critically ill patients. These models were juxtaposed with conventional systems (SIRS, qSOFA, and acute patient physiology and laboratory evaluation [APPLE] fast) to ascertain their efficacy in patient triage and prognostication. In this retrospective cohort study, data from 166 dogs admitted to the Department of Emergency and Critical care at Konkuk Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital between February 2021 and May 2023 were analyzed. Scoring systems were computed based on initial admission physical examinations (respiratory rate, heart rate, temperature, mentation, and systolic blood pressure) and laboratory results (white blood cell and platelet count and albumin, glucose, lactate, and CRP levels). Because no prior veterinary studies on the qSOFA-CRP model were available, optimal cutoff values were established using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the Youden index. Conventional scoring systems were compared with the modified qSOFA within the survivor and non-survivor groups. The most effective system was determined through ROC curve analysis. For the qSOFA-CRP model, we identified an optimal cutoff value for CRP at > 1.55 mg/dL. All modified qSOFA scoring systems showed significant differences between survivors and non-survivors, in contrast to the conventional scoring systems. Notably, the qSOFA-CRP model demonstrated the highest area under the ROC curve value (0.761, 95% CI 0.68-0.83) and odds ratio (13.373, p < 0.001) when evaluating mortality at 28 days. The qSOFA-CRP model, when employing a CRP threshold of 1.55 mg/dL, demonstrated promising potential as a novel criterion for triaging emergency and critically ill patients. However, further assessment is required in a larger population of patients at the precise early stage of sepsis."

The nonspecific nature of its clinical presentation, which may include chest pain, vomiting, and dyspnea, often overlaps with other thoracic or gastrointestinal disorders, making diagnosis challenging. This case report describes a 71-year-old female who presented with acute chest pain following episodes of vomiting. Initial clinical examination revealed tachycardia, tachypnea, and subcutaneous emphysema, raising suspicion of Boerhaave's syndrome. Diagnosis was confirmed through contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT), which revealed a 3 cm perforation in the thoracic esophagus with pleural effusion. The patient was managed surgically with emergency thoracotomy, debridement, primary esophageal repair reinforced with an intercostal muscle flap, and the placement of a feeding jejunostomy.

Chylous ascites (CA) is attributed to lymphatic damage and compression/obstruction of lymphatic vessels. There are few case reports of SBV with CA. A 70-year-old man, who had a history of laparoscopic total gastrectomy 10 years ago, presented to our emergency department with acute abdominal pain that lasted for 1 hour after eating dinner. The patient was diagnosed with acute small bowel obstruction secondary to SBV based on curved planar reconstruction (CPR) and underwent emergency surgery. The abdominal cavity had CA, the small bowel and mesentery showed overall white edematous changes, and the small bowel mesentery was twisted 360 degrees, but there was no small bowel ischemia or necrosis. After detorsion, surgery was completed. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 9. CPR is useful for diagnosing SBV in cases without typical CT findings. SBV with CA may not require small bowel resection due to necrosis, because occluded lymphatic vessels lead to small bowel and mesenteric edema, which inhibits further twisting. Additionally, surgical intervention is performed because of acute abdominal pain. We assume that dietary guidance is important because dietary factors may also be involved in SBV."

    "abstract": "Managing pregnant patients with mechanical heart valves who require non-cardiac surgery presents unique challenges, particularly in balancing anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolic complications while minimizing bleeding risks. This case report discusses the perioperative management of a pregnant patient with a mechanical mitral valve undergoing emergency appendectomy. A 28-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation with a history of rheumatic heart disease and a mechanical mitral valve presented with acute appendicitis. Anticoagulation therapy was shifted from warfarin to low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) to mitigate the risks of bleeding and teratogenicity. Intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) was used perioperatively to maintain adequate anticoagulation. A multidisciplinary team guided the patient's care, and she underwent a successful laparoscopic appendectomy with stable maternal and fetal outcomes. Perioperative anticoagulation in pregnant women with mechanical heart valves is critical to avoiding valve thrombosis while minimizing the risk of bleeding. In this case, using LMWH as a bridging therapy and UFH during surgery proved effective in balancing these risks. The case underscores the importance of a coordinated multidisciplinary approach to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes during emergency surgery. This case highlights the complexities of managing anticoagulation in pregnant patients with mechanical valves requiring non-cardiac surgery. With appropriate anticoagulation adjustment, multidisciplinary planning, and vigilant perioperative monitoring, both maternal and fetal outcomes can be favorable in such high-risk situations."

    "abstract": "Medullary carcinoma (MC) is a rare type of colon carcinoma that accounts for less than 1% of colorectal neoplasms. Morphologically, MC resembles many colorectal cancer (CRC) subtypes, mainly Neuroendocrine Carcinoma (NEC) due to exhibiting neuroendocrine features. In consequence, MC is exceedingly challenging to detect; numerous immunohistochemistry tests are required in order to distinguish it from the other subtypes of CRC. We report a case of a 16-year-old male who presented with severe abdominal pain and symptoms of bowel obstruction. Computed tomography scan showed a mass in the descending colon. The patient underwent an emergency colectomy. The left part of the transverse colon, the descending colon, and part of the sigmoid were removed, along with the regional lymph nodes. Microscopic examination suggested NEC, whereas immunohistochemical staining confirmed the diagnosis of MC of the left colon. After surgery, a course of chemotherapy was administered. Medullary carcinoma usually presents in elderly Caucasian women, and is mainly observed in the right colon. Therefore, it is highly unusual to appear in a 16-year-old boy's left colon. The diagnosis is based on microscopic and immunohistochemical tests. The optimal management of MC is surgery, combined with chemotherapy, and in some cases a full colectomy is needed. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the dilemma of diagnosing MC of the colon, as well as the successful management of MC through surgical intervention, and post-operative care."

The simultaneous occurrence of Meckel's diverticulitis with acute appendicitis is extremely rare. A 17-year-old male presented with acute abdominal pain and vomiting, accompanied by tenderness in the right iliac fossa. Laboratory investigations revealed neutrophilia and an elevated leukocyte count, while ultrasound findings were consistent with acute appendicitis. The patient underwent an emergency open appendectomy, during which an inflamed appendix was removed. Incidentally, an inflamed MD was also discovered and managed conservatively. Acute appendicitis and Meckel's diverticulitis share overlapping clinical and imaging features, making preoperative diagnosis difficult, thereby making intraoperative evaluation essential. The management of Meckel's diverticulitis varies depending on the patient's condition and clinical judgment. Given the difficulty in preoperative diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulitis, surgeons should routinely assess for MD during appendectomies, even when acute appendicitis is confirmed. Failing to identify and manage Meckel's diverticulitis may lead to complications and adversely affect patient outcomes."

The literature described a few cases of fecalomas causing hydronephrosis due to compression of the urinary tract. The presence of a urinary tract infection in the presence of ureteral obstruction poses a risk of developing obstructive pyelonephritis thereby requiring urgent treatment of the cause. Most fecalomas can be cleared using conservative measures. However, recognition of the need of surgical intervention in timely manner is paramount to avoid complications including acute kidney injury and bowel perforation."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis (AA) is one of the most common causes of surgical acute abdomen. Currently, laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) is the most frequently preferred surgical approach. As with all laparoscopic procedures, the possibility of conversion to open surgery also exists in LA. This study aims to identify the risk factors associated with conversion to open appendectomy (OA) during the laparoscopic management of AA. This retrospective case-control study included 445 patients who underwent LA for AA between 2018 and 2023. Patients were divided into two groups based on whether conversion to OA was required during the laparoscopic procedure. Preoperative demographic, clinical, and perioperative data were evaluated. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. The median age of the 445 patients included in the study was 34 years (interquartile range: 25-49). Of these, 58.2% were male. The overall conversion rate to open surgery was 3.8%. In univariate analyses, factors such as age (p=0.002), the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score (p=0.011), time of arrival at the emergency department (p<0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) level (p<0.001), amylase level (p=0.012), Malatya Complicated Appendicitis Prediction Score (MCAPS) ≥6 (p<0.001), and presence of complicated appendicitis (p<0.001) were associated with conversion. However, in multivariate analyses, only an MCAPS score of 6 or higher (p=0.034) was identified as an independent risk factor for conversion. Since conversion to OA is sometimes unavoidable in the management of AA, clinicians may benefit from using the easily applicable MCAPS to predict the likelihood of conversion. This scoring system may also assist in considering primary OA when appropriate."

    "abstract": "Colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is widely performed for large superficial colorectal tumors; however, it can lead to adverse events such as delayed perforation, which may require emergency surgery. Our goal was to elucidate the clinical course of delayed perforation and the safety and feasibility of intensive endoscopic interventions. Patients diagnosed with delayed perforation after colorectal ESD between February 2011 and April 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. Delayed perforation was defined as follows: no perforation during ESD; abdominal pain and fever after ESD; and extraluminal gas identified during CT imaging. ESD was performed for 1763 patients with 1845 lesions (right-sided colon, 1018; left-sided colon, 827). Thirty-three delayed perforations (27 between 2011 and 2020; 6 between 2021 and 2023) occurred. Muscle injury occurred during ESD in 4 patients. The ESD ulcer was closed in 6 patients. CT imaging was performed when abdominal pain with fever (n = 17), abdominal pain (n = 13), fever (n = 2), and fatigue (n = 1) were observed. The median period between ESD and CT imaging was 22 hours (IQR, 8-41.25 hours). Seven patients required emergency surgery between 2011 and 2020; of these patients, 5 underwent surgery within 6 hours after CT imaging and 2 required surgery after conservative treatment. Endoscopy was performed for 5 of 6 patients between 2021 and 2023. Endoscopic intervention and successful conservative treatment were performed after identification of the perforation. Intensive endoscopic interventions for delayed perforation after ESD may prevent emergency surgery."

We included 112 patients who underwent emergency surgery for colorectal perforation between April 2014 and September 2023. We performed a Kaplan-Meier analysis to assess 30-day postoperative survival with and without postoperative DIC, log-rank test to compare survival curves, and logistic regression analysis to identify preoperative predictive factors for postoperative DIC. The postoperative DIC and 30-day mortality rates were 37.5 ​% and 8 ​%, respectively. The 30-day postoperative mortality rates significantly differed between patients with postoperative DIC and those without (16.7 ​% vs. 2.9 ​%). The preoperative Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was an independent predictive factor for postoperative DIC. Evaluating preoperative SOFA scores may help assess postoperative DIC risk and enable early initiation of anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal perforation."

    "abstract": "Leucine rich alpha-2 glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) has emerged as a promising biomarker for appendicitis, especially in pediatric patients. However, the currently available data are sparse, and the biomarker must be validated in more settings and compared to standard inflammatory markers. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic and discriminative utility of serum and urine LRG1 in children with other causes of abdominal pain (no appendicitis) versus appendicitis, and uncomplicated versus complicated appendicitis. The study design was prospective including children ≤ 15 years with suspected appendicitis. Blood and urine samples were collected at the time of clinical evaluation at the Pediatric Emergency Department and analyzed for concentrations of LRG1. Appendicitis diagnosis and severity were determined through histopathological examination and intraoperative findings. Group comparisons were carried out using Kruskal-Wallis test with post hoc Dunn-Bonferroni tests for pairwise comparisons. Associations between LRG1 and other laboratory and clinical variables and the odds of appendicitis and complicated appendicitis were assessed by univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Diagnostic (no appendicitis versus appendicitis) and discriminative (uncomplicated versus complicated appendicitis) performance were evaluated through Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves with analyses of Areas Under the Curve (AUC). Optimal cutoffs were generated using Youden's index, and diagnostic and predictive values were calculated and compared. 172 children were included. 132 (77%) had appendicitis and 56 (42%) of these had complicated appendicitis. The median age was 10 (IQR 8-12) years and 98 (57%) were boys. Serum concentrations of LRG1 did not differ significantly between the groups. Urine LRG1 was significantly higher among children with complicated appendicitis and no appendicitis compared to children with uncomplicated appendicitis (p < 0.001). In the logistic regression analysis of all children with suspected appendicitis, increased serum LRG1 was associated with a decreased odds of appendicitis (OR 0.96 [95% CI 0.93-0.99], p = 0.008). This association remained after adjustment for age, sex and symptom duration (aOR 0.95 [0.92-0.98], p = 0.003). Urine LRG1 was not associated with the odds of appendicitis. Neither serum nor urine LRG 1 were significantly associated with the odds of complicated appendicitis. When it comes to diagnosing appendicitis, both serum and urine LRG1 had AUC values of 0.39. However, urine LRG had a specificity of 95% and a PPV of 83%. The discriminative performance of serum LRG1 was poor, but the AUC for urine LRG1 of 0.65 was better than the ones for leukocytes, neutrophils and neutrophil percentages. Still, it was lower than the AUCs for C-reactive protein (CRP) and Appendicitis Inflammatory Response (AIR) score. Urine LRG1 has a high specificity and PPV for all cases of appendicitis, and correctly identifies cases of complicated appendicitis to a greater extent than some of the currently available inflammatory markers. Still, the regression analyses show no significant associations between urine LRG1 and appendicitis and complicated appendicitis in children. In contrast to previous studies, in this cohort serum LRG1 was associated with decreased odds of appendicitis, shedding some doubt over the clinical utilization of serum LRG1 as a biomarker for appendicitis in children."

We investigated the feasibility and utility of assessing Puylaert staging on emergency department (ED) point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) to differentiate uncomplicated from complicated appendicitis in children. This was a pilot feasibility study of children ages 5-17 diagnosed with acute appendicitis in nine pediatric EDs. POCUS was performed by trained ED physicians. Puylaert staging of the submucosal layer was used to categorize the severity of appendicitis (stages 1-4) and was compared with surgical pathology reports. Test characteristics were computed to evaluate the accuracy of POCUS in differentiating appendicitis severity. Physicians recorded time to complete POCUS, ease of use, and their perception of acceptability by patients and families. Of 72 patients with complete data, all patients with uncomplicated appendicitis were accurately identified using POCUS (Puylaert stage 1 or 2). The sensitivity for identifying complicated appendicitis (Puylaert Stage 3 or 4) was 100% (95% CI: 77%-100%), and specificity was 65% (95% CI: 52%-78%). Ninety four percent of physicians agreed that the POCUS was easy to perform. One hundred percent agreed that it was well accepted by families. The average time to complete POCUS was 8 min. This study supports the feasibility and utility of assessing Puylaert staging by POCUS for children with appendicitis in the ED. High sensitivity to rule out complicated cases coupled with ease of use and perceived patient acceptance make this a potential adjunct to aid in the management of pediatric appendicitis."

A 59-year-old woman, who had undergone a revisional RYGB and was discharged 24 h post-surgery, returned to the emergency department with acute epigastric pain and vomiting at the 48-h mark. A contrast computed tomography scan revealed dilated small bowel loops, right pleural effusion, and some free gas. An emergency laparoscopy identified an obstruction at the jejunojejunal anastomosis caused by undigested food, including seeds. The obstructive material was removed, and the anastomosis was reconstructed. Subsequent psychiatric evaluation revealed the patient's abuse of zopiclone, taken at four times the recommended dose. This misuse likely led to anterograde amnesia, resulting in unreported dietary indiscretions.

After extubation and an unremarkable barium swallow study, he developed abdominal pain and tachycardia. Imaging showed free air under the diaphragm, and a CT scan indicated gastrointestinal perforation. Emergency surgery confirmed an anterior gastric ulcer perforation with purulent peritonitis. He was successfully treated with a washout and antibiotics and was discharged in stable condition.

The primary treatment for acute appendicitis is emergency surgery, which can be particularly challenging due to altered anatomical conditions. Preoperative and postoperative care may require certain examinations due to pregnancy that are not standard within surgical practice or may be overlooked by the attending gynecologist. A patient at 31 weeks of gestation presented to the obstetric clinic with an acute onset of acute appendicitis. After completing all necessary examinations and a thorough multidisciplinary evaluation, a successful laparoscopic appendectomy was performed. The subsequent hospitalization was complicated by the onset of uterine contractions, for which tocolysis was administered in combination with corticosteroid therapy to induce fetal lung maturity. In the presented case report, we demonstrate an example of the appropriate multidisciplinary approach with an analysis of the specific steps that should be taken to maximize the benefit for both the fetus and the mother, as well as the surgical team.

Chronic alcohol consumption and vitamin B-complex deficiencies are contributing factors. Acute cases may present with a range of neurological symptoms, including seizures and coma. Subacute and chronic forms can lead to interhemispheric disconnection syndrome and progressive dementia. We present the case of a young male patient's first hospital admission due to an acute decline in conscious level. A detailed history revealed regular alcohol consumption and substandard living conditions. The deterioration in consciousness was attributed to the diagnosis of MBD based on neurological signs, characteristic brain imaging findings, and a history of alcohol use. In addition, a small bowel perforation was also diagnosed. Supportive therapy and thiamine were initiated, and the patient was transferred to surgery for an operation. After two surgeries, the perforation was covered. The patient's level of consciousness showed slight improvement; however, the psychiatrist noted severe cognitive deficits. Ultimately, the patient entered a septic state and passed away. Acute MBD can potentially cause altered mental state, coma, and death; however, cases can be complicated by other emergency conditions. This case demonstrates the importance of a multidisciplinary approach."

    "abstract": "Based on 1) selective but relevant references from current subject-specific medical literature and 2) competent clinical experiences of the interdisciplinary, professional, and sectoral profile of emergency medicine specialists and general/abdominal surgeons, current contents and trends of emergency management with specific surgical relevance are to be outlined.Narrative review.In addition to acute inflammatory or tumour diseases of the GI tract (and neighbouring organs) including threatening or manifest perforation, adequate care of injured patients (by accidents, physical violence) as well as bleeding in abdominosurgical dimension belong to the general and abdominal surgery care profile in the emergency room. In case of emergency care, there is repeatedly an imbalance between the number and severity of the patients on one side and the available resources on the other side, due to considerable variations in case volume and range of patient's condition (extending from completely unaffected to vitally threatened patients). Beside the \"classical\" general and abdominosurgical clinical pictures and diseases, the surgical care spectrum extends increasingly to gunshot and stab wounds (penetrating injuries). While there are recommendations for traumatic injuries including the abdomen, in particular, for diagnostic, treatment and disposable personal resources, such standard care policy for general/abdominal surgery emergency patients does not exist. Standardisation of emergency diagnoses, registration and risk stratification based on existing findings (clinical, anatomical, radiological) as well as evidence-based clinical pathways and bundle of measures including the documentation of treatment results in a national register for quality assurance may lead to improvement in the care in general/abdominal surgery emergency patients.To fulfil adequately all the requirements in interdisciplinary emergency cases, stringent workflows, discipline-, finding- and diagnosis-related therapeutic standards, high and developing expertise of physicians and interprofessional collaboration are all essential. Clinical quality assurance with register-based documentation and periodic auditing may improve patient care. Basierend auf 1. einschlägigen selektiven Referenzen der aktuellen fachspezifischen medizinisch-wissenschaftlichen Literatur und 2. kompetenten klinischen Erfahrungen des interdisziplinären, professionellen und sektoralen Profils von Notfallmedizinern und Allgemein-/Viszeralchirurgen aktuelle Inhalte und Trends des Notfallmanagements mit fachspezifisch-chirurgischer Relevanz zu umreißen.Narrative Übersicht.Zum allgemein- und viszeralchirurgischen Versorgungsspektrum in der Notaufnahme gehören neben akut entzündlichen oder tumorösen Erkrankungen des GI-Trakts (und seiner Anhangsorgane) mit drohender oder stattgehabter Perforation auch die Versorgung von verletzten Patient*innen (Verkehrsunfall, physische Gewalt) sowie Blutungen mit viszeralchirurgischer Dimension. Bei der Notfallversorgung besteht aufgrund der starken Schwankungen des Patientenaufkommens sowie der Bandbreite des Patientenzustands (völlig unbeeinträchtigte bis zu zeitkritisch vital bedrohte Patient*innen) immer wieder ein Ungleichgewicht zwischen der Anzahl und der Fallschwere der zu versorgenden Patient*innen und den vorhandenen Ressourcen. Neben den „klassischen“ allgemein- und viszeralchirurgischen Krankheitsbildern erweitert sich das chirurgische Versorgungsspektrum zunehmend um penetrierende Verletzungen durch Schuss- und Stichverletzungen. Während es für traumatische Verletzungen, inkl. des Abdomens, Empfehlungen für die Diagnostik, Behandlung sowie die vorzuhaltenden personellen Ressourcen und Strukturen gibt, ist eine solche Standardisierung für allgemein-/viszeralchirurgische Notfallpatienten nicht existent. Die Standardisierung der Notfalldiagnosen, eine Erfassung und Risikostratifizierung anhand der vorliegenden Befunde (klinisch, anatomisch, radiologisch) sowie evidenzbasierte Behandlungspfade und Maßnahmenbündel mit Erfassung der Behandlungsergebnisse in einem nationalen Register zur Qualitätssicherung könnten zur Verbesserung der Versorgung von allgemein-/viszeralchirurgischen Notfallpatienten führen.Um einer angestrebten fokussierten Aufgabenerfüllung interdisziplinärer Notaufnahmen adäquat gerecht zu werden, sind stringente Arbeitsabläufe, fach-, befund- und diagnosebezogene Behandlungsstandards, eine hohe wie auch stetig weiterzuentwickelnde Fachexpertise der ärztlich-klinischen Akteure sowie eine interprofessionelle Zusammenarbeit unerlässlich, um dem gestellten Versorgungsauftrag gerecht zu werden.

Patients with neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDD) were identified using ICD-10 codes for the most common diagnoses in this category and matched to controls in a 1:2 ratio based on age, gender, and race/ethnicity. Our results indicate that patients with NDD presented significantly more often with complicated appendicitis with an odds ratio of 2.15 (p ​= ​0.003), had greater LOS, and more post-operative complications. These results point to a potential disparity that patients with disabilities may experience within emergency general surgery."

Open appendectomy was first described by McBurney in 1894 using an incision method, and in 1983, Semm performed the first laparoscopic appendectomy. The aim of this study is to share the outcomes of patients who underwent open and laparoscopic appendectomy in our center. Data from patients who underwent appendectomy between 2014 and 2023 at our center were retrospectively obtained from patient records and the Hospital Information Management System (HIMS). Sociodemographic characteristics, operation durations, hospital stay, complication rates, and pathology results of the patients were evaluated. A total of 627 patients were operated on for acute appendicitis between 2014 and 2023, of which 298 (47.5%) underwent laparoscopic appendectomy and 329 (52.5%) underwent open appendectomy. No statistically significant differences were found between the groups in terms of age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, operation duration, and final pathological results. However, hospital stay was significantly longer in the open appendectomy group (P = .001). Additionally, the complication rate was higher in the open appendectomy group, with a statistically significant difference (P = .046). Laparoscopic appendectomy is supported in the literature by lower complication rates, shorter hospital stays, and shorter operation times. Although laparoscopic appendectomy is as safe as open appendectomy, it is thought to provide the surgeon with an advantage in assessing other potential acute intra-abdominal pathologies. Therefore, we recommend laparoscopic surgery for patients with a preoperative diagnosis of appendicitis."

The patient was hospitalized as a case of IE and acute mitral valve regurgitation. In light of mitral valve perforation, large vegetation, and bacteremia, an urgent multidisciplinary decision to proceed with mitral valve replacement was made, and the patient received a total of 6 weeks of antibiotics. Physicians should remain highly vigilant for IE, its rare causes, and associated complications. In addition, managing complex cases of IE necessitates a multidisciplinary team approach between cardiology, infectious diseases, and cardiac surgery teams."

On the other hand, hematologic disorders and infectious processes in the abdominal cavity may cause PVT uncommonly. We present a case of PVT following acute appendicitis and laparoscopic appendectomy in this report. A 32-year-old male was admitted to our emergency room due to lower quadrant pain and vomiting. Acute appendicitis was diagnosed and after a routine laparoscopic appendectomy, the patient was discharged. The patient was admitted to the emergency room with nonspecific epigastric pain on postoperative day 30. Portal vein thrombosis was diagnosed by computed tomography. Hematologic investigations revealed a homozygous mutation of the methylene tetrahydrofolate 1298 gene. Immediate low-molecular-weight heparin administration was initiated. The gastrointestinal system council and interventional radiology team opted for a medical approach and converted the low-molecular-weight heparin to apixaban. The computed tomography revealed the complete resolution of the thrombus on postoperative day 100. Laparoscopic appendectomy can be complicated by portomesenteric axis thrombosis. When unusual findings are encountered during the postoperative follow-up period, rapid and detailed examinations should be performed."

In this review, we provide an update on recent literature regarding the diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis via labs, imaging, and clinical prediction scores, and provide a summary of key pitfalls in diagnosing this condition. Progress has been made in laboratory evaluation for the diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis with newer markers being under investigation, though standard markers such as white blood cell count and C-reactive protein remain prominent. From an imaging standpoint, there is emphasis on the use of ultrasound as the primary imaging modality, and creating new protocols for magnetic resonance imaging as a secondary imaging method if ultrasound is inconclusive. Clinical prediction scores continue to be a promising diagnostic tool with the literature indicating high specificity but rather low sensitivity. A wide array of diagnostic practices exist creating disparities in care, particularly with imaging. Pediatric appendicitis is a challenging diagnosis with ongoing research efforts focused on novel laboratory markers that are more sensitive and specific, prioritizing the use of nonionizing radiation imaging modalities, and improving reliability of clinical prediction scoring tools. Reducing disparities in care surrounding pediatric appendicitis should be a focus for future research."

    "abstract": "Pericardiocentesis, a procedure with potential life-saving implications, can lead to complications such as cardiac perforation. Emergency open cardiac surgery, the conventional approach for addressing iatrogenic or traumatic cardiac perforations, is associated with unfavourable outcomes in high-risk patients. This report explores a case of accidental iatrogenic right ventricular (RV) puncture, which was effectively managed using a percutaneous closure device. A 42-year-old male was hospitalized due to a persistent cough, dyspnoea, and fever, raising suspicion of tuberculosis. He was found to have a large pericardial effusion with signs of impending cardiac tamponade. During an attempted pericardiocentesis at an outside facility, his right ventricle was inadvertently perforated by a catheter. He was transferred to a specialized hospital to be assessed by a cardiac surgeon, where the heart team performed a percutaneous closure of the perforation using an Angio-Seal device, which was successful. A subsequent pericardiectomy was performed to address the effusion and confirm the absence of tuberculosis or malignancy. The patient recovered well, and follow-up imaging showed no worsening of the pericardial effusion. He was discharged in stable condition. Pericardiocentesis, while crucial for treating large pericardial effusions, carries a small risk of complications such as ventricular perforation. Although surgery is a cornerstone in management, the Angio-Seal device has been used successfully in some cases to repair these tears. In this case, an Angio-Seal device effectively closed a RV rupture, with no further complication seen in follow-up exams. This suggests Angio-Seal as a potentially useful, less invasive option for treating such complications."

    "abstract": "Mother's milk (MOM) provides numerous benefits for very preterm infants; however, it requires fortification to achieve appropriate nutrition intake. Although cow milk-based human milk fortifier (CMHMF) is widely used in Japan, it poses a risk of fatty acid calcium formation in infants with ileostomy. An exclusive human milk diet (EHMD) uses only human milk products to fortify MOM or donor human milk using a human milk-based human milk fortifier. Compared to CMHMF, EHMD reduces feeding intolerance and necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants and may be safely used in infants with an ileostomy. However, specific studies addressing the nutritional effects of EHMD in these patients are lacking. This case report discusses the potential benefits of an EHMD in an infant undergoing ileostomy. The male infant, weighing 742 g, was delivered by emergency cesarean section at the postmenstrual age of 26 weeks and three days. On day eight of life, the patient underwent intestinal resection and anastomosis for a localized intestinal perforation. CMHMF could not be used because of the risk of fatty acid calcium stone formation. Given concerns regarding malnutrition, the case was administered an EHMD. Following the introduction of EHMD, his weight gain improved from 5 g/day to 17 g/day, and his z-score improved from -0.8 standard deviation (SD) to +0.3 SD. No adverse events were observed. It is suspected that the improvement in the anthropometric data was attributable to the establishment and maintenance of full feeding volumes alongside the EHMD, which ensured adequate nutrition and increased nutritional intake. This case suggests that EHMD may be a safe and effective nutritional strategy to promote optimal growth and development in infants undergoing abdominal surgery."

Superior mesenteric vein thrombosis (SMVT) is a rare and severe complication with a dangerous course and a high mortality rate. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is also rare in patients treated with heparin and presents with thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. We report a patient with SMVT diagnosis who was treated with heparin anticoagulation after surgery and eventually developed HIT. CASE REPORT The patient was a 30-year-old woman with a diagnosis of SMVT 10 days after giving birth to her second child. She was treated with heparin anticoagulation and interventional catheter-based thrombolysis and thrombectomy, which was ineffective, and she showed peritonitis. We therefore performed an emergency laparotomy, during which we found partial small intestine necrosis and performed a partial small bowel resection. However, the systemic thrombosis worsened postoperatively, and after a multidisciplinary team consultation, HIT was diagnosed. After switching to non-heparin anticoagulation, the patient's condition improved, and she was discharged from the hospital. CONCLUSIONS This is the first case report of HIT secondary to heparin anticoagulation in a parturient who underwent surgery for intestinal necrosis caused by SMVT. Our case highlights the challenge of treating SMVT and the difficulty of diagnosis of HIT. SMVT is a serious condition that requires sufficient experience to judge the timing of surgery. HIT is a rare complication that occurs during heparin use, and its timely diagnosis and treatment have a significant impact on patient prognosis."

    "abstract": "An 81-year-old woman had been constipated for a week and experienced nausea and decreased appetite 3 days earlier. She developed chills and general fatigue and was referred to our department. A plain abdominal computed tomography (CT)scan showed wall thickening of the descending colon, the oral side of the intestine was significantly dilated and filled with fecal masses, the anal side of the intestine was collapsed, and ascites and free air were present. Emergency surgery was performed. The area from the cecum to the descending colon was markedly dilated, and a tumor was identified in the descending colon. Fecal fluid leaked from 2 locations on the anterior wall of the cecum, and the walls from the cecum to the ascending colon were poorly colored and necrotic. The necrotic intestine was resected, and an ileostomy and transverse colon mucous fistula were constructed. Radical surgery was performed 26 days after the surgery. Invasion of the transverse colon by descending colon cancer was suspected; therefore, we performed resection from the transverse colon to the sigmoid colon, D3 dissection, and transverse colon-sigmoid colon anastomosis. After adjuvant chemotherapy, the ileostomy and mucous fistula were closed. Nearly 3 years have passed since the radical surgery, and the patient is currently under follow-up with no recurrence."

    "abstract": "Short bowel syndrome can manifest as either an inherited or acquired condition, with the inherited form occurring sporadically. Furthermore, the complete absence of the omentum at birth (congenital absence) is a highly uncommon event. This case report presents a unique confluence of these rare conditions in a 38-year-old Iranian male with a prior history of intestinal obstruction requiring right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. He subsequently presented to the emergency department experiencing intense abdominal pain and swelling in his lower extremities. Laboratory investigations revealed an elevated white blood cell count and metabolic alkalosis. During the surgical exploration prompted by his acute presentation, both congenital absence of the omentum and short bowel syndrome were confirmed. A jejunostomy was performed, but unfortunately, this intervention resulted in severe malabsorption and subsequent cachexia. This case sheds light on the rare occurrence of anastomotic leakage and subsequent peritonitis following right hemicolectomy and ileostomy in a patient with the combined conditions of congenital short bowel and congenital absence of the omentum. This unique presentation highlights the potential complexities that can arise due to the convergence of these rare medical conditions."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Tracheal perforation, although rare, poses significant challenges for anesthesiologists following thyroid surgery, often necessitating complex airway management under general anesthesia. There is limited literature on effective strategies for managing airway complications in these patients. This report details a case of successful airway management using awake fiberoptic intubation in a patient with tracheal perforation and necrosis following a thyroidectomy. CASE REPORT A 65-year-old woman developed tracheal perforation 6 months after left hemi-thyroid lobectomy. She presented with symptoms of sore throat and neck swelling. Preoperative exams revealed an erosive tracheal perforation (3 cm) on the left side, immediately below the glottis. She was scheduled for an urgent tracheostomy under general anesthesia. A multidisciplinary team discussed various airway management strategies, including awake fiberoptic intubation, awake tracheostomy, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Due to the adequate distance between the perforation and the tracheal bifurcation, awake fiberoptic intubation was selected. In the operating room, the bronchoscope was carefully advanced below the perforation site, and the endotracheal tube was then gently passed over the bronchoscope, ensuring the cuff did not disturb the perforation. The tube was positioned with its tip just above the tracheal bifurcation, and general anesthesia was subsequently initiated. Postoperative histological analysis of the tissue obtained during the tracheostomy revealed squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting that malignancy-related tracheal necrosis may have contributed to the perforation. CONCLUSIONS We report successful airway management in a patient with tracheal perforation following left hemi-thyroid lobectomy. Awake fiberoptic intubation proved to be an essential technique for managing such complex cases."

    "title": "Nonabsorbable Polymeric Clips for Appendicular Stump Closure during Laparoscopic Appendectomy.",
    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most frequent cause of emergency surgical procedures performed worldwide. Laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) has gained considerable popularity in the last decades. However, the ideal method for appendicular stump closure during LA is still debatable and depends on the surgeon's preference and intraoperative judgment. The endoloop ligatures (EL) is the most used method but its application is quite challenging. The efficacy of nonabsorbable polymeric clip (PC) has been proven and it was first described for appendicular stump closure in 2007. A retrospective comparative cohort study was conducted including all consecutive patients who underwent LA from January 2017 to the end of 2023 in a tertiary university hospital. Data were retrieved from their electronic medical files. The patients were classified into 2 groups. The appendicular stump was closed using EL, in the first group, and using PC, in the second group. The calculated operative time started from the patient's entry to the operating theatre till transfer to the recovery room. Out of 556 patients who underwent LA, 483 patients were included and classified into Group I (313 patients with EL), and Group II (170 patients with PC). Intraoperatively, complicated acute appendicitis was found in 27.8% and 36.5% and the median diameter of the appendix was reported 10 and 11.4 millimeters, respectively. The procedure was significantly shorter using PC (70 minutes vs 75 minutes, P = .03) and the cost was lower using PC ($42.6 vs $95.8). Intra-abdominal collection was reported in 1.6% and 0.6%, localized abscess was reported in 1% and 0.6%, and the hospital readmission rate was 3.19% and 1.18%, respectively. The use of nonabsorbable PCs is safe and feasible for appendicular stump closure during LA for acute appendicitis."

    "title": "Acute Appendicitis in a Pediatric Minority Population: Uncommon Presentations of a Common Disease.",
    "abstract": "Introduction Acute appendicitis (AA) is universally regarded as a leading cause of emergency surgery. Both a fiber-rich diet and socioeconomic status are suggested to affect the clinical and epidemiological properties of AA. The Arab minority, the largest ethnic minority in Israel, has unique dietary habits and socioeconomic characteristics, which may influence the presentation and outcomes of AA. Despite the known seasonal patterns of AA incidence, especially during summertime, variations within specific ethnic subpopulations remain underexplored. Methods We conducted a retrospective study focused on pediatric patients from the Arab minority in Israel. Clinical data were collected and analyzed from 401 pediatric patients with a primary diagnosis of AA. The collected variables included vital signs, laboratory workups (white blood cell (WBC) counts, C-reactive protein (CRP), and neutrophil percentages), and surgical reports. The analysis aimed to identify differences between simple and complicated AA cases within this subpopulation and compare the findings with reports from both Israel and worldwide. Results A total of 401 pediatric patients from the Arab minority with AA were analyzed. Male predominance was observed, with 62.5% (n = 251) of cases being males. Despite the commonly reported summertime peak for AA, our data showed no significant seasonal variability for both simple and complicated AA. Regarding clinical presentation, both sexes had similar blood pressure and body temperature at admission; however, females exhibited higher heart rates than males. Notably, over 90% of patients presented without fever, having body temperatures below 38°C, even in complicated cases. Laboratory findings revealed differences between simple and complicated AA. In simple AA, WBC and CRP levels were mildly elevated (WBC 13.4 ± 4.5 × 10³/mm³, CRP 3.3 ± 5.4 mg/dL). In contrast, complicated AA cases showed significantly elevated heart rates, WBC, neutrophil percentages, and CRP levels. Among biomarkers, WBC <10⁴ cells/mm³ effectively ruled out complicated AA (negative predictive value (NPV) 98.7%, sensitivity 98%), while CRP >5 mg/dL had the highest specificity (81%) but lower sensitivity (54%) and limited predictive value (NPV 92%). The complicated AA rate was 12.7%, which is lower than previously reported in regional and global studies. Additionally, 18.5% (n = 74) of patients received non-operative management (NOM), a higher rate than typically reported locally. Conclusions This study highlights key clinical patterns and diagnostic insights among AA patients from a pediatric minority population. Arab children demonstrate male predominance, consistent AA rates across seasons, and are less likely to present with fever or complicated AA compared to other populations. Furthermore, WBC and CRP emerge as useful tools for ruling out complicated AA, despite their limited predictive value for confirming it. Notably, the low complicated AA rates and higher NOM rates (18.5%) may reflect unique dietary habits and healthcare accessibility patterns within this minority group. Our findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of AA presentation in diverse populations and underscore the importance of tailored clinical assessments for minority subpopulations."

We present the case of an 18-year-old male who presented with spontaneous pneumomediastinum after nitrous oxide inhalation. An 18-year-old Caucasian British male patient presented to the emergency department complaining of sharp, central, pleuritic chest pain that radiated up to the throat and was worse on lying down. On examination, palpable surgical emphysema was noted on the neck and was noted on chest X-ray. A computed tomography of neck and chest was then performed, which revealed extensive pneumomediastinum tracking along the cervical, axillary, presternal, and anterior pericardial regions. A water-soluble contrast study was performed, which showed no evidence of esophageal perforation. Nitrous oxide is a substance that is widely and easily available and used recreationally for its euphoric effects. There are uncommon but significant side effects that can occur with its use; having an awareness of this and covering illicit drug use in history-taking will help guide further management plans."

    "abstract": "Intestinal perforation is a serious medical emergency, and traditional surgery often causes adhesion and other complications. Innovative hydrogels improve postoperative care and rehabilitation with their anti-adhesion, antibacterial, and hemostatic properties. We have developed an advanced anti-adhesion hydrogel, AA-A30, composed of polypyrrole-modified gelatin (PPy-GelMA), carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS), and NHS-functionalized polyethylene glycol (PEG-NHS). This hydrogel is specifically tailored for intestinal perforations. Upon hydrolysis, PEG-NHS forms a protective barrier that effectively prevents adhesion to surrounding normal tissues. Furthermore, the integration of PPy-GelMA significantly extends the degradation duration of the hydrogel, from 24 to 48 h. In a mouse model of intestinal perforation, the AA-A30 hydrogel demonstrated remarkable efficacy in inhibiting inflammation and preventing tissue adhesion by modulating the expression of both inflammatory and tissue adhesion-related factors, such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and the ratio of tPA to PAI-1. These findings underscore the considerable potential of AA-A30 for the therapeutic management of intestinal perforations."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Acute appendicitis (AA) is one of the most common surgically treated diseases, and perforation is a complication that increases morbidity and mortality. At our institution, providers frequently prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics for patients with appendicitis. Methods: We performed a subset analysis of patients with perforated appendicitis in a multisite quality improvement project to decrease broad-spectrum antibiotic utilization for AA. Surgeons and emergency department providers were educated on antibiotic therapy for AAs. Electronic medical record (EMR) orders were optimized to encourage ceftriaxone plus metronidazole preoperatively and discourage piperacillin/tazobactam. Results: During the study periods, a total of 116 patients had perforated appendicitis and underwent laparoscopic appendectomy, 45 in the 6-month pre-protocol group (pre-AB) and 71 in the 6-month post-protocol group (post-AB). The groups were similar regarding baseline demographics, vital signs, and hematological workup. Preoperative piperacillin/tazobactam utilization rates were 62.2% in the pre-AB group and 25.4% in the post-AB group (p < 0.0001), and the utilization rates of ceftriaxone plus metronidazole were 8.9% and 53.5%, respectively. Thirty-day readmission rates were similar: 15.6% in the pre-AB group versus 5.6% in the post-AB group (p = 0.104). Surgical site infections (SSIs) were comparable among groups: superficial SSI 0.0% versus 2.8% (p = 0.521), deep SSI 4.4% versus 0.0% (p = 0.148), and organ space SSI 17.8% versus 8.5% (p = 0.152). No patient had a Clostridium difficile infection postoperatively. Conclusion: Education regarding antibiotic therapy and optimization of orders in the EMR can decrease the utilization of broad-spectrum antibiotics for acute perforated appendicitis without increasing SSIs."

    "abstract": "Post-traumatic diaphragmatic hernia (PTDH) is defined as the migration of intra-abdominal organs into the chest through a pathological defect in the diaphragm caused by trauma. PTDH is a rare condition, occurring in 3%-7% of all thoracoabdominal injuries. Approximately 14.6% of PTDH cases present months to years after the initial trauma. Cases of delayed PTDH complicated by bowel obstruction and perforation are exceedingly uncommon, with a reported prevalence of 0.17%-6%. In Africa, fewer than 10 cases of delayed PTDH have been documented over the past three decades. Despite the availability of published reports, there are no established practice guidelines for managing PTDH. Here, we present a case of delayed PTDH that manifested as acute bowel obstruction 12 years after a gunshot wound to the chest. The condition led to a fatal postoperative outcome. This case highlights the critical need for clinicians to consider PTDH in patients with a history of trauma presenting with acute bowel obstruction and underscores the importance of urgent surgical management to prevent fatal complications."

However, cement leakage during the procedure can lead to severe complications, including cardiac perforation. This report presents a case of right atrial perforation and pulmonary embolism caused by cement leakage, emphasizing the clinical significance of these events and discussing the treatment strategy. A 57-year-old female was admitted to the hospital with a slipped lumbar vertebra and back pain, for which she underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty. On the 10th postoperative day, the patient suddenly developed chest tightness and shortness of breath, accompanied by a gradual decline in hemoglobin levels. After several imaging studies, a diagnosis of right atrial perforation caused by bone cement was confirmed. The patient subsequently underwent open cardiac foreign body removal and made a full recovery, with no residual cardiac dysfunction. This case highlights the rare but serious complication of right atrial perforation caused by bone cement leakage during percutaneous vertebroplasty. The report emphasizes the importance of early identification of bone cement-related complications. While conservative management may suffice for pulmonary embolism, urgent surgical treatment is required for cardiac cement embolism to prevent further complications."

    "abstract": "Blunt abdominal trauma poses diagnostic challenges, particularly in identifying cryptic gastrointestinal perforations. This case report highlights the critical role of meticulous imaging analysis and timely surgical intervention in managing occult bowel injuries following automobile accidents. A 48-year-old male presented with acute abdominal discomfort, muscular rigidity, and peritoneal signs 12 hours after a nighttime traffic collision. Initial abdominal computed tomography (CT) demonstrated ileocecal contusion and ascending colon hematoma, but suboptimal window settings initially obscured evidence of perforation. Emergency laparoscopic exploration revealed turbid bloody fluid, ileocecal laceration, and extensive colonic edema, necessitating conversion to open surgery. Surgical interventions included ileocecal repair, double-barrel colostomy, saline irrigation, and drainage tube placement. Postoperative care emphasized infection control and wound management. Intraoperative findings confirmed gastrointestinal perforation, corroborated by subsequent CT re-evaluation with adjusted window parameters. The patient recovered uneventfully, with discharge achieved two weeks postoperatively. Follow-up imaging indicated resolution of colonic edema and successful stoma function. This case underscores the diagnostic pitfalls of suboptimal CT settings in occult bowel perforation and advocates for proactive surgical exploration in equivocal trauma scenarios. Multidisciplinary collaboration, precision in imaging interpretation, and tailored surgical strategies are pivotal for favorable outcomes in blunt abdominal trauma. The findings reinforce the necessity of integrating clinical suspicion with advanced diagnostic modalities to mitigate delayed complications."

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols have been implemented to diagnose appendicitis without exposure to ionizing radiation. Our objective was to describe MRI adoption trends and evaluate the association of MRI adoption with appendicitis complications. We performed a retrospective cohort study of children aged less than 19 years old with appendicitis presenting to 46 pediatric emergency departments between 2010 to 2023. The exposure was presentation at an MRI-adopting hospital, defined as a hospital using MRI more often (> 50%) than computed tomography for patients requiring cross-sectional imaging for appendicitis, determined annually. The primary outcome was complicated appendicitis, based on diagnosis codes for perforation, sepsis, bowel resection, or abscess drainage. Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit admission and hospital length of stay. Logistic regression models with a random intercept for hospital were used to identify the association of MRI adoption and complications. Among 155 884 children with appendicitis, 19 232 presented to MRI-adopting hospitals (12.3%). MRI adoption increased 16.2% per year (95% CI, 8.0-25.0), from 3.0% in 2010 to 18.2% in 2023. MRI adoption was associated with lower odds of any complication (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.79, 95% CI, 0.74-0.84). Appendiceal perforation (aOR 0.77, 95% CI, 0.72-0.82) and abscess drainage (aOR 0.84, 95% CI, 0.73-0.96) occurred less frequently in MRI-adopting hospitals. Intensive care unit admissions were less common at MRI-adopting hospitals (1.1% vs 1.6%; P < .001). Children's hospitals have slowly adopted MRI for appendicitis, but most still primarily rely on computed tomography. Our finding that MRI adoption is associated with a lower risk of complicated appendicitis warrants further investigation."

To confirm the appendiceal neoplasm rate associated with periappendicular abscess. The Peri-Appendicitis Acuta Tumor prospective multicenter cohort study was conducted at 12 hospitals in Finland. All consecutive adult patients diagnosed with acute appendicitis were included, focusing on patients with imaging confirmed periappendicular abscess undergoing interval appendectomy or emergency appendectomy with available histopathology from December 3, 2020, through December 2, 2022. These data were analyzed from May 2023 to September 2024. Recommended treatment was initial antibiotics and, if needed, drainage, followed by interval appendectomy at 3 months. The main outcome was appendiceal tumor rate associated with periappendicular abscess. Secondary outcomes included tumor histology and prognostic factors for appendiceal tumor (age, sex, body mass index, duration of symptoms, C-reactive protein level, white blood cell count, computed tomography findings, and tumor markers). There were 6165 consecutive patients with acute appendicitis. Of these, 396 patients (6.4%) presented with periappendicular abscess, with 9 patients declining to participate and 17 patients without available appendiceal histopathology, leaving 370 patients for the analysis (181 female [48.8%] and 189 male [51.2%]; median age, 58 [range, 18-90] years). Appendiceal tumor rate in patients with periappendicular abscess was 14.3% (53 of 370; 95% CI, 10.8%-17.9%), which was higher compared with uncomplicated acute appendicitis (14.3% vs 1.5%; 48 of 3170; 95% CI, 1.1%-1.9%; P < .001) and complicated acute appendicitis without periappendicular abscess (14.3% vs 2.4%; 63 of 2599; 95% CI, 1.8%-3.0%; P < .001). Patient age (odds ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.04-1.09; P < .001) was the only factor associated with periappendicular abscess tumor prevalence. A cutoff point of age 35 years with high sensitivity was chosen (area under the curve, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.68-0.82) and only 1 patient below this threshold presented with an appendiceal tumor (sensitivity, 98.1%; 95% CI, 94.5-100). Of the 54 tumors on 53 patients, there were 21 low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms, 20 adenocarcinomas, 8 adenomas, and 5 neuroendocrine tumors. The complication rate of emergency appendectomy was higher than after interval appendectomy (31.3% [70 of 224] vs 4.8% [5 of 105], respectively [P < .001]). This large prospective cohort study confirmed a high appendiceal tumor rate associated with periappendicular abscess, especially in patients older than 35 years. At the least, all patients older than 35 years should undergo routine interval appendectomy. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04634448."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Necrosis of the rectus or lateral abdominal wall investing fascia may be associated with invasive infections or closure under extreme tension. This can lead to fascial dehiscence and evisceration of the intra-abdominal contents. Globally, abdominal wound dehiscence varies from 0.4% to 3.5% with associated mortalities reaching up to 45% in the perioperative period. Redo surgical operations and infectious complications are the major risk factors for abdominal wound dehiscence, but also presence of low albumin, glucocorticoid use, chest infections, and emergency surgeries have been also implicated. Open abdomen has been employed in incidences of trauma where a second look operation may be necessary, loss of abdominal wall, sepsis after penetrating abdominal trauma, and in cases of severe secondary peritonitis and acute pancreatitis. Patients with open abdomen are at a risk of fistula formation, sepsis, and loss of abdominal domain due to lateral fascial retraction. To reduce the mentioned complications mesh and nonmediated techniques to bridge fascia defects have been recommended with particular emphasis on biologic meshes with or without negative pressure wound therapy, component separation, or planned ventral hernia. Methods: We report a case of necrosis of the rectus and abdominal wound dehiscence and its management in a sub-Saharan setting, highlighting the challenges encountered and lessons learned. Conclusion: Retention sutures should be used cautiously in the management of wound dehiscence as it increases the risk of fascial necrosis in cases of intra-abdominal hypertension, as seen in our patient. In the absence of a VAC dressing, the utilization of routine saline gauze dressing promotes epithelialization over the exposed bowel and is a viable alternative to temporary abdominal closure modes of managing an open abdomen in a resource-limited setting."

Our study is aimed at evaluating the incidence and associated risk factors of complicated AA among children presenting with this condition. Methods: Employing a cross-sectional design, we included all children suspected of having AA who were admitted to a tertiary pediatric center in Iran from 2020 to 2021. Pathologists examined all surgically removed appendices, and only cases with histopathological confirmation of AA were included. We classified AA into complicated and uncomplicated categories. We recorded and analyzed demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of patients admitted with AA. Analyzed laboratory parameters included white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil count and percentage, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Results: The study comprised 98 pediatric patients with AA, including 60 males (61.2%) and 38 females (38.8%), with a median age of 9.0 (interquartile range: 7.0-11.0) years. Eighteen (18.4%) cases were diagnosed with complicated AA. Mean WBC count, neutrophil count, and CRP levels were significantly higher in patients with complicated AA (p values: 0.048, 0.018, and 0.014, respectively). After adjusting for relevant clinical factors, CRP (odds ratio: 1.02 [95% CI: 1.00-1.04]), WBC count (1.18 [1.03-1.37]), and neutrophil count (1.23 [1.06-1.45)]) were significantly associated with complicated AA. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated a CRP cut-off of 19.5 mg/dL, with an area under the curve of 0.687 (95% CI: 0.551-0.823), a sensitivity of 72.2%, and a specificity of 68.4% for predicting complicated AA. Conclusions: Laboratory parameters, specifically WBC count, neutrophil count, and CRP levels, are significant independent predictors of complicated AA in pediatric patients. These findings could assist in the timely diagnosis and management of children suspected of having AA in clinical practice."

We sought to determine whether variation in clinical care and outcomes exists for patients treated by the emergency general surgery service at our trauma center. We performed a retrospective cohort study at a Level 1 trauma center (2017-2022) of emergency general surgery patients who transferred from other facilities or presented directly to the emergency department. The primary exposure variable was presentation during nights and weekends versus weekdays. To test for changes in the volume of interfacility transfers, the primary outcome was transfer status. The secondary outcome was mortality. We performed risk adjustment using demographic data, payer status, and preexisting conditions. We conducted subgroup analyses for predominant diagnoses and sensitivity analyses by defining \"off-hours\" using alternative times. The study included 7,274 patients, including 5,303 (72.9%) who arrived during off-hours and 3,195 (43.9%) transfers. Mortality was 6.5% (n = 472 patients). Off-hour presentations were associated with a significantly greater risk-adjusted likelihood of presenting as a transfer (adjusted odds ratio, 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.87-2.40), a finding consistent across all subgroups except for patients with appendicitis, choledocholithiasis, or pancreatitis. Increases in age, interfacility transfer, decreases in initial systolic blood pressure, and increases in initial heart rate were all associated with a statistically significant increased risk of mortality. However, we found no difference in mortality based on timing of presentation (adjusted odds ratio, 0.80; confidence interval, 0.63-1.01). All findings were robust to sensitivity analyses. Nights and weekends were associated with increased rates of interfacility transfer, although mortality was no greater than during weekdays.

These cases were marked by significant technical challenges, including extensive adhesions, dense fibrous encapsulations, and severe intraoperative hemorrhage necessitating blood transfusions. Despite these complexities, all transplants were successfully completed. One patient experienced a peak serum AST of 2000 U/L, and another had a bilirubin of 10 mg/dL, indicative of early graft dysfunction, both of which resolved within the first week. One patient required an emergency laparotomy due to hemorrhage. No additional severe complications were observed postoperatively. All patients are currently alive with functioning grafts and have been followed for at least 18 months. A multidisciplinary approach and advanced surgical planning are crucial for successfully performing complex liver transplants in patients with SEP. Intraoperative recognition of SEP requires meticulous strategies to minimize blood loss and optimize hemostasis, while avoiding organ injuries, as these factors are critical for improving the survival outcomes in these patients."

    "title": "Diagnostic accuracy of tongue coating in identifying acute appendicitis: a prospective cohort study.",
    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis requires timely diagnosis. The diagnostic efficacy of tongue examination in making this diagnosis has not been established. This study investigates whether the Tongue Coating Index (TCI), a validated measure of tongue coating, can aid in diagnosing acute appendicitis. We conducted a prospective cohort study (1 September 2018-31 December 2020) at a single Japanese hospital. Adults (≥20 years) with suspected acute appendicitis, presenting to either the emergency department or general outpatient clinic, were enrolled. Tongue images were taken at presentation; two independent examiners-unrelated to clinical care and blinded to patient data-later scored these images using the TCI. A composite reference standard (clinical findings, imaging, histopathology, follow-up) was used to confirm appendicitis. We compared the TCI's diagnostic performance with the Alvarado score and its components using C-index, area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. Of 145 included patients, 69 (47.6%) were diagnosed with acute appendicitis. The TCI demonstrated comparable discriminative ability (C-index AUC 0.62; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.71) to that of the Alvarado score (0.66; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.75). Of Alvarado score components, migration of pain had an AUC of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.55 to 0.71), anorexia 0.58 (95% CI, 0.50 to 0.66) and tenderness in the right lower quadrant 0.55 (95% CI, 0.50 to 0.60). At a cut-off of 3, the TCI demonstrated high sensitivity of 96% (95% CI, 88% to 98%) but low specificity of 21% (95% CI, 13% to 32%). Conversely, at a cut-off of 10, the TCI showed increased specificity of 83% (95% CI, 73% to 90%) but reduced sensitivity of 29% (95% CI, 20% to 41%). The TCI showed comparable diagnostic performance to the Alvarado score and its individual components. TCI may potentially serve as an additional non-invasive indicator for diagnosing or ruling out acute appendicitis. Further research is essential to validate its clinical utility."

    "abstract": "Gallstone ileus occurs when gallbladder stones erode and become lodged in the small bowel, thereby causing obstruction. These stones usually impact the terminal ileum because of its narrow lumen; however, they can also be found in less common locations, as observed in our case. The presence of pneumobilia can indicate gallstone ileus even without visible radiopaque stones because not all gallstones are detectable on computed tomography (CT). A 74-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with severe right upper quadrant pain that started 1 week previously and became more aggressive associated with fever, leukocytosis, and vomiting. The pain was colicky, intermittent, and aggravated by movement but did not radiate. Further imaging was requested to investigate the cause of the pain, which revealed evidence of proximal small bowel obstruction due to radiolucent gallstone ileus. Radiolucent gallstone ileus is a rare but serious condition requiring prompt surgical intervention. The presence of pneumobilia can indicate gallstone ileus even when the stones are not visible on CT. Large stones can cause blockages in the proximal small bowel. The ability of radiological imaging to detect gallstones varies according to their composition."

    "abstract": "A 4-year-old male presented to the emergency department with fever, mucous diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting for 36 hours. On abdominal palpation, he had generalized pain without rebound and increased hydroaereal sounds. The blood count showed leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein, and an ultrasound revealed intestinal loops with abundant content, increased peristalsis, and a normal appendix. Due to the suspicion of invasive gastroenteritis, he was admitted for observation. Due to the persistence of symptoms, a new ultrasound was performed which showed pelvic free fluid but did not identify the appendix. An abdominal radiography was previously performed, which showed an image compatible with appendicolith. With the suspicion of appendicitis, surgery was indicated, and an appendicular peritonitis was identified. The patient recovered well and was discharged seven days later. Diagnosing appendicitis in children can be a complex process. The most sensitive diagnostic tests are ultrasound and tomography. Abdominal radiography, however, is a widely available test with low radiation and has a positive predictive value of 90% for appendicitis (detecting appendicolith or periappendicular 'air silence'). In ambiguous cases, an abdominal X-ray could avoid invasive tests that require sedation or high doses of radiation. Un varón de 4 años acudió a urgencias por un cuadro de 36 horas de fiebre, diarrea mucosa, dolor abdominal y vómito. Presentaba dolor generalizado a la palpación abdominal profunda, sin defensa y ruidos hidroaéreos aumentados. La analítica mostró leucocitosis y elevación de PCR y una ecografía visualizó asas intestinales con abundante contenido, peristaltismo aumentado y un apéndice normal. Con la sospecha de gastroenteritis invasiva fue ingresado en observación. Ante persistencia de la sintomatología se realizó nueva ecografía evidenciando líquido libre pélvico sin identificar el apéndice, por lo que se planteó realizar tomografía, no obstante, previamente se optó por una radiografía abdominal observando una imagen compatible con apendicolito. Con la sospecha de apendicitis se indicó la cirugía, identificando una peritonitis apendicular. El paciente evolucionó favorablemente siendo dado de alta siete días después. Establecer el diagnóstico de apendicitis puede ser complejo en niños. Los estudios más sensibles son la ecografía y tomografía. La radiografía abdominal, por su parte, es una prueba ampliamente disponible, de baja radiación y con hallazgos con un valor predictivo positivo del 90% en la apendicitis (apendicolito, \"silencio aéreo\" periapendicular). En cuadros ambiguos, una radiografía abdominal podría evitar pruebas invasivas que precisan sedación o altas dosis de radiación."

    "title": "Therapeutic effectiveness and influencing factors of laparoscopic appendectomy with mesoappendix dissection in the treatment of acute appendicitis.",
    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis (AP) is a frequently encountered surgical emergency, and appendectomy is conventionally regarded as the predominant treatment modality. Nevertheless, the therapeutic efficacy of this surgical approach remains to be improved. Thus, the exploration and implementation of surgical refinements are necessary. To elucidate the therapeutic effectiveness and influencing factors of laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) with mesoappendix dissection in the treatment of AP. First, 150 patients with AP who visited Shangrao Municipal Hospital between January 2022 and June 2024 were enrolled in this study. Among them, 72 patients were assigned to the control group to receive conventional LA, whereas 78 cases were included in the observation group for LA with mesoappendix dissection. Subsequently, indicators such as therapeutic effectiveness, surgical indices (operation time, intraoperative blood loss, and hospital stay), postoperative recovery indices (time to ambulation, gastrointestinal function recovery time, and time to food intake), incidence of adverse events (postoperative bleeding, pelvic infection, puncture site infection, and ileus), and serum inflammatory factors [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP)] were collected and comparatively analyzed, and the influencing factors of therapeutic effectiveness in patients with AP were analyzed. Compared with the control group, the observation group had higher clinical therapeutic effectiveness, less operation time, intraoperative blood loss, and hospital stay; shorter time to ambulation, gastrointestinal function recovery, and food intake; and a lower total incidence of adverse events, and this difference is statistically significant. In addition, the expression levels of various serum inflammatory factors in the observation group were significantly reduced postoperatively, which were markedly lower than those in the control group. Moreover, sex, age, body mass index, time from acute onset to admission, family medical history, preoperative TNF-α, preoperative IL-6, preoperative CRP, and treatment modality were identified to be not independent factors affecting the therapeutic effectiveness of LA with mesoappendix dissection in patients with AP. Overall, LA with mesoappendix dissection has a remarkable curative effect in treating patients with AP, which is worthy of clinical promotion."

    "abstract": "A 62-year-old otherwise healthy Caucasian female patient presented to the emergency department with a one-day history of severe abdominal pain, accompanied by nausea and non-bloody emesis. She did not report any prior similar episodes and denied any history of abdominal surgery. Although she did not report a history of diagnosed endometriosis, she did report a history of dysmenorrhea. Laboratory tests in the emergency room showed mild leukocytosis. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed a small bowel obstruction with a transition point in the right lower quadrant with associated reactive enteritis. A diagnostic laparoscopy was subsequently performed. Intraoperatively, we found an adhesive band from the appendix to the sigmoid colon resulting in an internal hernia. Laparoscopic adhesiolysis was performed to release the adhesive band, and since the appendix looked a little abnormal, the decision was made to perform an appendectomy. Her surgical pathology showed endometriosis near the appendiceal tip, estrogen receptor-positive (ER+). Her peritoneal fluid cytology was negative for malignant cells. The patient did well post-operatively and had no complications."

    "abstract": "Aggressive fibromatosis (AF), also known as desmoid tumor, is a rare condition characterized by the proliferation of monoclonal fibroblasts, primarily originating from connective tissue. Despite being histologically benign, AF exhibits malignant-like behavior, including local invasion and a high recurrence rate. AF can be classified based on its location into extra-abdominal, abdominal wall, and intra-abdominal types. Intra-abdominal AF (IAF), though least common, has the worst prognosis and highest mortality rate. Traditionally, complete surgical resection (R0) was the preferred treatment, but recent strategies favor conservative management, especially for asymptomatic patients. Emergency surgery is reserved for complications like bleeding, perforation, or obstruction. This report details a rare case of IAF in the retroperitoneum of a 39-year-old woman presenting with hemorrhagic shock. Emergency surgery, including partial distal pancreatectomy and partial gastrectomy, was performed. The tumor was β-catenin positive, confirming the diagnosis of IAF. Postoperatively, the patient recovered well and showed no recurrence after 2 years without additional therapy. In summary, IAF presents significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Effective management relies on a multidisciplinary approach, combining various diagnostic tools to improve early detection and patient outcomes. Continued research is essential to understand the pathogenesis of AF and to develop less invasive treatment options."

    "title": "Andexanet Alfa in Urgent Cardiac Surgery: A Case Report of Edoxaban Reversal for Acute Hemopericardium.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Antidotes to non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOAK) like idarucizumab and andexanet alfa have been approved for reversing the effects of dabigatran and apixaban/rivaroxaban, respectively. However, andexanet alfa is not approved for reversing edoxaban. Current guidelines recommend using specific reversal agents in emergencies, but they do not support andexanet alfa for edoxaban reversal. This study illustrates the off-label use of andexanet alfa for edoxaban reversal in a case of acute hemopericardium requiring urgent cardiac surgery, addressing the practical challenges and clinical outcomes. CASE REPORT We report the case of a 71-year-old woman who required urgent cardiac surgery following acute pericardial tamponade caused by hemopericardium during right-heart catheterization. After emergency pericardiocentesis, andexanet alfa was administered to address any residual effects of edoxaban (Lixiana), along with protamine to reverse the effects of heparin. The patient was transferred in stable condition for cardiac surgery, where a right ventricular perforation responsible for the hemopericardium was sutured, and mitral valve replacement was performed via cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) due to severe mitral valve regurgitation. No adverse cerebrovascular, hemorrhagic, or thromboembolic events were observed. CONCLUSIONS This case demonstrates an unconventional off-label use of andexanet alfa to stabilize a patient on edoxaban. Although the patient did not have any adverse effects, the thromboembolic risks of andexanet alfa and potential heparin resistance warrant cautious use, especially before cardiac surgery. Successful management was achieved through a multidisciplinary approach. Further research is needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of andexanet alfa in patients on edoxaban therapy."

    "abstract": "To determine the incidence, seasonality, geographic distribution, and risk factors for emergency department presentations with corneal ulcers and perforated corneal ulcers. Retrospective, population-based cohort study of corneal ulcers in California from 2012 to 2021. Overall and stratified yearly incidence rates, seasonality, individual-level and postal code-level risk factors for perforation, and geographic clustering were evaluated. This study included 31,019 emergency department (ED) visits for corneal ulcers, with 263 cases coded as perforated corneal ulcers. The average yearly incidence was 7.94 (95% confidence interval, 7.85-8.03) per 100,000 people for ED-diagnosed corneal ulcers and 0.67 (95% confidence interval, 0.59-0.76) per 1,000,000 people for perforated corneal ulcers. Male patients, Black patients, and primary English-speaking patients had the highest incidences across sociodemographic groups. For ED-diagnosed corneal ulcers, the incidence was highest among individuals aged 20 to 60 and for perforated corneal ulcers the incidence was highest among individuals over age 75. Significant geographic clustering was observed, with hotspots in the Central Valley and inland Northern and Southern California. Visits were seasonal, with incidence peaking in July and lowest in February. Increasing age, Spanish as a preferred language, and having health insurance were significant risk factors for presenting with a perforated corneal ulcer. Indicators of low socioeconomic status were associated with higher rates of corneal ulcers. The incidence of ED-diagnosed corneal ulcers in California increased over the study period with a notable seasonal pattern. Higher rates were observed in Black individuals and in areas with lower socioeconomic status, providing evidence of health disparities and identifying potential targets for public health interventions."

When admitted to the emergency room, she had normal vital normal laboratory findings, and the basic X-ray image of the abdomen did not indicate intra-abdominal perforation and ileus. On palpation, her abdomen was continuously diffusely painful, and the elastic wall had no defence musculature; there was no back pain. Given the clinical picture of a \"pseudoacute abdomen\", the patient was examined by an internist, surgeon and gynaecologist. Three hours after admission, during examination, the patient suffered a fatal cardiorespiratory arrest which did not respond to resuscitation procedures which were applied immediately and for one hour. At autopsy, an infraceliac complete asymmetrical ruptured abdominal aortal aneurysm of the posterolateral wall, 9 cm in length, was found with massive coagulum and fresh blood filling the entire retroperitoneum. Pathohistologically, a typical lesion of abdominal aortal aneurysm dissection into media with intimal fragmentation, intramural haematoma and mild atherosclerotic plaques was proven. The cause of sudden death was declared to be unknown, spontaneous, non-traumatic ruptured abdominal aortal aneurysm with massive retroperitoneal bleeding and ireversible haemorrhagic shock."

    "abstract": "Background. Aerococcus urinae was initially considered a commensal of the urinary tract, but there is now increasing evidence for its involvement in urinary tract and systemic infections. A. urinae endocarditis has a non-negligible mortality rate and occurs mainly in patients with underlying conditions or the presence of extraneous material. Case presentation. This report handles the case of a 65-year-old male with cardiac antecedents, who was admitted to the cardiology department after a syncope of unknown origin and diagnosed with severe mixed aortic valve disease and mitral valve sclerosis through the means of transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE). During hospitalization, the patient progressively deteriorated with the development of shortness of breath and an inflammatory syndrome. Both the urine and blood cultures showed growth of A. urinae. Treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam was started empirically. Repeated TEE showed evidence of endocarditis with vegetation and perforation of the mitral valve that required an emergency surgery with mitral valve repair. After surgery, gentamicin and penicillin G were administered for 48 h, followed by combined ceftriaxone/penicillin G treatment for 6 weeks. At first, flucloxacillin was also associated as the culture of the valve was negative. Finally, the 16S rRNA gene PCR on the valve tissue confirmed the A. urinae endocarditis. Conclusion. A. urinae is an underestimated cause of serious infections such as endocarditis. Urinary tract infections mainly in older men can be an entry point for this type of invasive infection."

    "title": "Acute total intestinal volvulus caused by sclerosing mesenteritis: a case report and review of the literature.",
    "abstract": "Intestinal volvulus arises from the twisting of an intestinal loop around a fixed axis. This condition is distinguished by both the obstruction and constriction of the intestinal lumen, as well as the entrapment of intestinal blood vessels. Consequently, the intestinal obstruction resulting from volvulus is often of the strangulating variety, which poses a risk for swift intestinal necrosis. Mesenteric tumors are a notable precipitant of volvulus. However, certain nontumor lesions originating from the mesentery can also lead to severe intestinal volvulus. A 68-year-old Chinese female individual was hospitalized because of severe abdominal pain that occurred 6 h after engaging in physical labor. An abdominal computed tomography examination revealed volvulus of the mesenteric root and the presence of a mixed-density mass in the right mesentery, with the possibility of a neoplastic process not ruled out. Emergency surgical exploration confirmed that the small mesenteric tumor served as a pivot, with the mesenteric root twisted 1440°, leading to total necrosis of the small intestine. As a result, total small intestine resection and enterostomy were performed. Postoperative pathological examination of the mesenteric tumor revealed fat necrosis, excessive calcification, peripheral fibrous tissue hyperplasia, and chronic inflammatory cell infiltration, consistent with a diagnosis of sclerosing mesenteritis. The patient's life was saved through timely surgical intervention. However, owing to the development of short bowel syndrome, she will require long-term dependence on parenteral nutrition. Intestinal volvulus due to sclerosing mesenteric inflammation is an exceedingly rare occurrence. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for this condition when encountering cases of intestinal volvulus attributed to mesenteric tumors. Prompt and decisive surgical intervention is crucial for saving lives and for preserving as much of the intestinal tract as possible."

Epidemiological data concerning bacterial pathogens are important in tailoring antibiotic stewardship recommendations.This study aims to assess trends over the years in bacterial distribution, and sensitivities (specifically multidrug-resistant [MDR] Enterobacteriaceae) in surgical appendicitis among two different ethnic communities in southern Israel.This was an observational, single-center, retrospective study. Included were children less than 18 years of age with surgical appendicitis treated in Soroka University Medical Center between 2010 and 2020 that had a positive intraoperative intraperitoneal bacterial swab culture. Data were assessed using univariable and multivariable analyses including multiple linear regression and negative binomial regressions with time series analysis to compare between periods during the study while accounting for confounders.Overall, 1,858 specimens were available for analysis from 2,264 children with confirmed surgical appendicitis. Pathogenic bacteria were recovered in 684 (36.8%), with nearly half polymicrobial. MDR Enterobacteriaceae pathogens were more common in the Arab-Bedouin community as compared with the Jewish community (32.6% vs. 18.6%, p < 0.001). Time series analysis detected an 8.7% significant increase in MDR pathogens per year (p = 0.003) with male children (10% per year [p = 0.016]), children younger than 12 years (10% per year [p = 0.014]), and children of the Arab-Bedouin community (8.7% per year [p = 0.025]) accounting for this increase in MDR isolates.MDR pathogens incidence has significantly increased between 2010 and 2020 and this should be considered in the choice of antibiotic therapies and antibiotic stewardship programs in the hospital and the community."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are rare mesenchymal neoplasms, comprising less than 1 % of gastrointestinal tumors. Arising from interstitial cells of Cajal, GISTs are frequently found in the stomach and small intestine. Typically asymptomatic, GISTs can occasionally present as acute abdominal emergencies, including hemorrhage, obstruction, or perforation. This report presents a case of spontaneous perforation of a large ileal GIST, leading to peritonitis. An 82-year-old man arrived at the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. Physical examination showed abdominal tenderness and distension, and laboratory findings indicated elevated inflammatory markers. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 15 cm mass in the lower right abdomen, with free fluid and extraluminal air suggesting perforation. Emergency laparotomy confirmed a perforated tumor, with purulent peritonitis. Surgical resection of the affected ileum and cecum was performed, followed by anastomosis and enterostomy. Histopathology confirmed a high-risk GIST, and the patient recovered well post-operatively, subsequently beginning adjuvant imatinib therapy. GISTs commonly remain asymptomatic until complications arise. Peritonitis due to tumor perforation is rare and necessitates prompt surgical intervention. Surgical resection remains the standard treatment for localized GISTs, with adjuvant imatinib recommended for high-risk cases. CT imaging is critical for diagnosis and surgical planning. While GIST perforation leading to peritonitis is rare, it requires urgent surgery. High-risk GIST patients benefit from adjuvant imatinib and should undergo long-term follow-up. This case highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach for complex GIST presentations and associated complications."

While usually asymptomatic, it occasionally presents with complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or mimicry of acute appendicitis, often leading to diagnostic challenges. CASE REPORT A 29-year-old obese woman presented to the Emergency Department with acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever, clinically suggestive of acute appendicitis. Examination revealed right iliac fossa tenderness, and laboratory findings showed elevated white blood cell counts. Computed tomography (CT) imaging indicated an inflammatory mass in the ileo-cecal region, raising suspicion for appendicitis with possible abscess formation. During emergency laparotomy, diffuse thickening and lipomatous infiltration of the ileo-cecal junction were identified rather than a ruptured appendix. Ileo-cecal resection was performed, and histopathological analysis confirmed diffuse submucosal lipomatosis without malignancy or evidence of true inflammatory appendicitis. CONCLUSIONS This case emphasizes the importance of considering rare conditions like intestinal lipomatosis in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain, particularly in atypical presentations. While radiological findings may suggest common conditions like appendicitis, they may be inconclusive, necessitating surgical exploration. Early recognition of ileo-cecal lipomatosis is essential for timely and appropriate management, reducing the risk of unnecessary procedures or complications. Increasing awareness of this rare entity among clinicians can improve diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes."

    "title": "Stercoral Colitis: Review of Imaging Features and Complications.",
    "abstract": "Stercoral colitis is an inflammatory reaction secondary to fecal impaction and almost always occurs in the setting of chronic constipation. Luminal distention caused by dense and dehydrated stool compresses the vascular supply of the distal colon, resulting in bowel ischemia and ulceration. Stercoral colitis primarily affects elderly patients, but it can be seen in any patient with decreased bowel motility, with risk factors including neurodegenerative disorders, chronic medical diseases, malignancy, immobility, and the use of narcotic or anticholinergic medications. Patients most often present with abdominal pain and tenderness. However, the presentation is often nonspecific and can include nongastrointestinal symptoms. Due to the common presence of comorbidities, a thorough history and physical examination findings may be difficult to obtain. Imaging, especially CT, plays a vital role in the diagnosis of stercoral colitis, demonstrating hallmark features such as fecal impaction and a large colorectal stool burden. Mural thickening (>3 mm) and other CT signs of inflammation aid in diagnosis, although findings including perirectal fat stranding can be nonspecific. Signs of perforation, including mural discontinuity, extraluminal air, and extraluminal stool collections, can also be identified. Other potential complications include obstruction, bleeding, fistulas, and urinary tract involvement secondary to mass effect. The overlap of findings between stercoral colitis and other colonic diseases, particularly diverticulitis and malignancy, can sometimes make diagnosis challenging. Identification of fecal impaction and associated inflammatory changes helps in distinguishing stercoral colitis from other pathologic conditions. Prompt diagnosis of stercoral colitis and its complications allows appropriate management, which can range from preventive measures to emergent surgical treatment. ©RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article."

This retrospective audit included all consecutive corneal breakdowns in TED patients between November 2011 and May 2023. The primary outcome measure was the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and secondary outcome measures included proptosis, clinical activity score (CAS), and proportion of globe salvage. In all, 35 TED patients (50 eyes; 15 bilateral) were included in this study. The mean age was 50.6 + 16 years (range 17-83), and 23 were male. Median TED duration was 5 months (range 1-108). Seven patients (nine eyes) developed corneal breakdown ≥2 years after disease onset. Corneal breakdown was graded as superficial punctate keratopathy in 18, microbial keratitis in 14, and microbial keratitis with thinning and/or perforation in 18 eyes. At median follow-up of 17 months (range 2-72), in the orbital decompression group, overall mean BCVA before and after orbital decompression showed improvement from 1.2 to 0.7, mean proptosis from 25.4 ± 3.5 to 20.7 ± 2.1 mm, and median CAS from 4.2 ± 1.3 to 0.3 ± 0.6. In the medical management group, the mean BCVA changed from 1.7 to 1.5, mean proptosis from 22.5 ± 2.5 to 22.3 ± 2.4 mm, and CAS from 3.0 ± 1.4 to 1.1 ± 1.4 before and after treatment, respectively. At the final follow-up, 44 eyes (88%) achieved globe salvage, while six eyes were eviscerated. Corneal breakdown necessitates expeditious and intensive multimodal management - topical medications, systemic medications, eyelid surgery, and orbital decompression surgery. In severe corneal breakdown with microbial keratitis with thinning and perforation, multimodal management helps achieve a high percentage of vision and globe salvage."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstructions represent a major cause of hospitalization, morbidity and mortality in surgical emergency departments. The Gastrografin protocol could be an effective tool in facilitating its evaluation and treatment. A prospective observational study was conducted on patients admitted to the emergency department with a diagnosis of small bowel obstruction treated with the Gastrografin challenge to analyze risk factors related to the outcome. 55 patients were included. In 38 patients (69.09%) the resolution of the occlusive condition was obtained. The progression of Gastrografin in the colon at x-ray was correlated to the positive outcome (p = 0.001). Older (>75 years old) and frailer patients were related to protocol failure and submitted more to surgery (p = 0.043; p = 0.022). Air-fluid levels at x-ray was related to negative outcome (P = 0.027). Higher doses of Gastrografin (100 ml vs. 50 ml) seems unrelated to obstruction resolution. At the two-year follow-up, among the 38 patients who tested positive, 8 patients (21.05%) had further access to the emergency department due to intestinal obstruction and were re-treated conservatively. The standardized diagnostic-therapeutic protocol with Gastrografin is a valid tool in the non-operative management of small bowel obstructions offering a resolution of the obstructive condition in 70% of patients."

    "abstract": "The worldwide prevalence of gallstones (GSs) is estimated to be between 10% and 15% in the general population. Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is the most common biliary tract neoplasia, and it is characterized by highly aggressive behavior and poor overall prognosis. Long-standing GSs and chronic inflammatory state represent the most common risk factors for GBC, promoting a carcinogenic microenvironment. Long-standing GSs expose patients to potentially severe surgical and oncological complications. A 71-year-old gentleman, who had never experienced biliary symptoms and had diabetes mellitus (DM), presented with severe peritonitis due to perforated acute calculous cholecystitis. The patient underwent an emergent laparotomic cholecystectomy. Histopathology found a rare pT2b poorly differentiated squamocellular carcinoma of the gallbladder. Although more difficult due to the concomitant inflammatory context, it is critical to identify suspicious lesions during preoperative imaging in patients at high risk of malignancy presenting with complex acute gallbladder pathologies. A review of the literature was conducted to gain a deeper insight into the relationship between long-standing GSs and GBC, evaluating also the difficult diagnosis and management of malignancy in the acute setting. Considering the existing literature, the choice to pursue a prophylactic cholecystectomy may be justifiable in selected asymptomatic GS patients at high risk for GBC."

    "abstract": "The incidence of right colon cancer presenting in a stage with complications is significant. There are major differences in therapeutic approach between elective colon cancer surgery and emergency surgery. Complications such as hemorrhage, obstruction, and perforation require careful evaluation of prognostic factors, with morbidity and mortality rates being much higher compared to elective colon surgery. We retrospectively analyzed a group of 95 patients admitted in an emergency to the County Emergency Hospital St. Apostol Apostol Andrei Galati with complicated tumors of the right colon-occlusive, perforated, or hemorrhagic. A series of clinical and biological parameters were followed in order to identify the prognostic factors in the occurrence of death. We analyzed the specialized literature, comparing our study with other similar research from the most important databases. The postoperative death rate in patients with complicated right colon cancer was high. Most complications were occlusive, followed by hemorrhagic and perforative."

    "title": "Laparoscopic lavage: an option for surgical management of complicated diverticulitis.",
    "abstract": "Acute diverticulitis with perforation and peritonitis is a serious complication affecting up to 12% of patients. Peritonitis is classified into purulent (Hinchey III) or fecal (Hinchey IV) categories. The standard treatment has traditionally involved emergency surgery, such as bowel resection with or without anastomosis or Hartmann's procedure, both of which carry high morbidity and mortality risks. In 2008, laparoscopic peritoneal lavage (LPL) emerged as a less invasive alternative for treating purulent peritonitis. This article outlines the LPL technique, emphasizing patient selection, procedural steps, and postoperative care. Several clinical trials have compared LPL to traditional resection methods. These trials show that while LPL is associated with lower stoma prevalence and shorter recovery times, it also carries a higher risk of reoperation and misdiagnosis, especially in cases of fecal peritonitis. Proper patient selection, such as excluding immunosuppressed patients and those with Hinchey IV peritonitis, and careful intraoperative assessment are crucial for successful outcomes. While LPL is not superior to resection, it is a viable alternative in select cases. LPL offers a minimally invasive option for treating complicated diverticulitis in appropriately selected patients, though careful surgical expertise and patient-centered decision-making are essential to optimizing results."

    "title": "Small bowel intussusception after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass - A case report.",
    "abstract": "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is a common elective bariatric operation performed to facilitate weight loss in patients with obesity. Although generally associated with a low rate of late complications, intestinal intussusception can very rarely occur in patients who have undergone RYGB, with significant clinical consequences. This case reinforces the importance of prompt recognition and surgical intervention in cases of intussusception following RYGB, explores the proposed pathophysiology of intussusception, and highlights the options for surgical intervention. We report a case of a 52-year-old female presenting with a small bowel obstruction secondary to intussusception in the context of a RYGB performed 8-years previously. Computed tomography (CT) and diagnostic laparoscopy confirmed intussusception of a long segment of the biliopancreatic limb into the Roux limb through the jejuno-jejunal anastomosis. Unable to be reduced laparoscopically, the anastomosis was resected en bloc and refashioned. The patient recovered well, and reported no features of recurrence or other surgical complication at post-operative review. The aetiology of intussusception following RYGB is unclear, although hypotheses include interruption of duodenal pacemaker cells following transection of the small bowel and consequent development of ectopic jejunal pacemaker cells, increased mobility of the mesentery following extreme weight loss, or the jejunojejunal anastomosis functioning as a transition point. In cases of compromised bowel resection is essential, although the approach in cases of non-compromised bowel is less clear. The recognition of late RYGB complications is becoming increasingly important in the setting of the increasing prevalence of bariatric surgery. Intussusception is an infrequent but significant complication that requires urgent surgical intervention."

    "title": "Acute Appendicitis or Appendiceal Diverticulitis? A Case Report and Systematic Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "Background: Appendiceal diverticulitis is a rare and poorly understood condition of the appendix. The diagnosis of appendiceal diverticulitis is challenging due to its rarity and a clinical presentation that often mimics other ileocecal disorders. Unlike acute appendicitis, appendiceal diverticulitis may be associated with a higher risk of perforation, increased mortality, and a potential link to neoplasms. However, further research is necessary to enhance our understanding of its epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, and outcomes. Case Report: A 53-year-old male presented to the emergency department with right lower abdominal pain. On physical examination, tenderness was noted in the right lower quadrant, without rebound tenderness or muscle guarding. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Ultrasonographic imaging of the ileocecal region suggested acute appendicitis, leading to a decision for surgical intervention. Laparoscopic exploration revealed multiple cylindrical, red, and edematous herniations, up to 4 mm in size, on the surface of the vermiform appendix. An appendectomy was performed. Histopathological examination confirmed appendiceal diverticulitis with surrounding peridiverticulitis. The surgery and early postoperative course were uneventful. Literature review: The study included 5 retrospective studies and 30 case reports, analyzing a total of 112 patients with appendiceal diverticulitis. Of these, 65.5% were male and 34.5% were female, with a median age of 49 years (IQR: 39-59). The most commonly reported clinical findings included pain in the right iliac fossa or right lower abdominal quadrant (56.5%), nausea (18.9%), vomiting (9.8%), rebound tenderness (24.6%), fever (15.6%), leukocytosis (25.4%), and elevated C-reactive protein levels (16.4%). Diagnosis was confirmed histopathologically in 86.9% of the cases via computed tomography imaging in 4.1% and ultrasonography in 1.6%. A histopathological analysis identified five neoplasms (4.1%), including two sessile serrated adenomas, two neuroendocrine carcinoids, and one mucinous tumor. Appendectomy was the treatment of choice, with no intraoperative or postoperative complications recorded and no mortality reported. The median hospital stay was 6.8 days (IQR: 3.0-6.8). Conclusions: Appendiceal diverticulitis should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with symptoms resembling acute appendicitis. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality. Appendectomy is a safe and effective treatment approach for appendiceal diverticulitis."

    "abstract": "Pericardiocentesis is both therapeutic and diagnostic invasive procedure, guided by echocardiography and/or angiography. It can be done using subcostal or apical approach. One of the major complications of pericardiocentesis is coronary artery laceration with an incidence of less than 1%. Diagnosis of such lacerations is often made by invasive coronary angiography or urgent thoracotomy. Computed tomography angiography is used to determine the extent of bleeding and hemopericardium, but its potential for detailed evaluation of bleeding site is somewhat underestimated. We present a rare case of distal obtuse marginal (OM) artery perforation resulting from apical pericardiocentesis that was diagnosed with CT angiography (CTA) further treated with coronary guidewire particle embolization. A 49-year-old male patient who had undergone ascending aorta and aortic arch reconstruction after an aortic dissection Type A was evaluated with echocardiography before being discharged from our hospital. A loculated pericardial effusion was identified, necessitating pericardiocentesis. The clinical course was further complicated by hemopericardium due to coronary laceration. The hemorrhage was managed with coronary guidewire segment embolization which led to immediate improvement in hemodynamic status. The patient was discharged seven days after intervention. Coronary artery perforation is a rare, albeit life-threatening complication of pericardiocentesis that requires urgent surgical or percutaneous intervention. CTA can provide important diagnostic information on perforation location and help in deciding whether embolization or open-heart surgery is needed to address ongoing bleeding."

    "abstract": "A woman in her 70s with a history of liver transplantation presented with constipation and leucocytosis. Imaging demonstrated a large obstructing sigmoid mass. She underwent a colonoscopy that showed narrowing but no luminal mass. She underwent an interventional radiology guided biopsy of the mass. Post-procedurally, she developed tachycardia and hypotension. She was taken to the operating room and was found to be haemorrhaging from the biopsy sites. The haemorrhage was controlled, and she underwent a diverting transverse loop colostomy. Postoperatively, she developed distributive shock that progressed despite resuscitative efforts. Her pathology returned as Epstein-Barr virus positive monomorphic post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma type. The distributive shock was from massive cytokine release secondary to her lymphoma, so she was started on an urgent chemotherapy regimen. Despite this, she never recovered haemodynamically, and she was compassionately extubated. The clinical presentation of PTLD can be variable with rapidly progressing life-threatening manifestations."

    "abstract": "Rectal foreign bodies (RFBs) are now an increasing presentation in the emergency rooms. While they most often result from insertion for sexual gratification, other causes, such as body packing and criminal or accidental insertion, can also occur. Various foreign objects of different shapes, sizes, textures, and materials are encountered, sometimes with impaction, perforation, and peritonitis. Other challenges include delayed presentation and reluctance to provide required details due to social stigma. In our case, the patient presented with abdominopelvic pain and obstipation. Upon further questioning, he admitted inserting a sweet lime fruit with sexual intent on the previous day. Digital rectal examination revealed a hard, round mass measuring 7 × 7 cm, located 4 cm from the anal verge. There were no signs of perforation or peritonitis; an X-ray confirmed the same. Since the anal sphincter was lax, a transanal extraction was attempted at the emergency room. The patient was anxious and failed to relax his anal sphincter completely. Hence, he was taken to the operating room. Under intravenous sedation and perianal block, a well-lubricated proctoscope was introduced, and a foreign body was incised to facilitate the grasping of the outer peel. The foreign body was then removed in pieces with ease. Postoperative proctosigmoidoscopy was normal, and the patient was discharged after psychiatric assessment and counseling. Hence, a systematic approach is recommended in diagnosing and managing RFBs. Psychiatric assessment and follow-up are also crucial in these patients."

    "abstract": "The rupture of hepatic hydatid cysts into the peritoneal cavity is an uncommon but life-threatening condition that can result in complications such as peritonitis and anaphylactic shock. This report describes the case of a 39-year-old diabetic male who presented with acute epigastric pain, fever (39°C), and abdominal rigidity. Imaging studies revealed pneumoperitoneum and the rupture of a large hepatic hydatid cyst measuring 20 × 30 cm located in the right lobe of the liver. Emergency laparotomy confirmed the rupture, and surgical management involved peritoneal lavage and initiation of antiparasitic therapy. The patient recovered fully and was discharged 23 days after surgery. Rupture of hepatic hydatid cysts occurs in only 1%-2% of cases and is often associated with large cyst size (>10 cm) and superficial location. Early imaging, particularly with CT, is crucial for diagnosis, while surgical intervention aims to manage the rupture, prevent further complications, and address residual cysts. This case highlights the significance of prompt diagnosis and management to avoid severe outcomes such as secondary peritoneal hydatidosis and anaphylactic shock."

    "abstract": "The spleen is a frequently injured organ, with over 40,000 adult splenic injuries occurring yearly. It plays an important role in the body's immune system, so surgeons should make every effort to perform splenic salvage when able. In blunt injury, indications for emergent splenectomy have not recently changed and include hemodynamic instability and peritonitis. A computed tomography (CT) scan with intravenous contrast is the preferred imaging modality for hemodynamically normal patients and should be used to classify the grade of injury and identify active bleeding and its stigmata. Nonoperative management has been successful for all grades of blunt injury (80-95%), but it is the job of the surgeon to carefully select the patient, in the context of their age, other associated injuries, and splenic CT findings, so this success rate remains high. Angioembolization is an important tool for splenic salvage that should be used when an actively bleeding vessel is observed on CT scan. Both proximal and distal embolizations are effective with no data to suggest that one is superior to the other. All patients selected for nonoperative management require close monitoring, which can include interval CT scans for high-grade injuries. Penetrating splenic injuries differ from blunt injuries because they are more likely to be surgically explored on presentation and they have a higher operative splenorrhaphy rate."

    "abstract": "Tension pneumothorax (TP) is a clinical emergency that requires immediate treatment. However, there are specific cases that may be misdiagnosed as TP in clinical settings, potentially leading to iatrogenic injury. The goal of this study was to analyse and summarize instances of misdiagnosis in order to improve the clinician's ability to recognize and distinguish pseudotension pneumothorax (PTP). Cases misdiagnosed as TP were retrospectively analysed by literature retrieval, and the related clinical characteristics were summarized. A total of 45 cases were misdiagnosed as TP, including 27 (60.0%) cases of diaphragmatic hernia (DH), 9 cases of giant pulmonary bullae, 8 cases of cystic lung lesions and 1 case of pulmonary hydatid cyst. A total of 77.8% cases occurred in emergency and paediatric departments. Among patients with DH, 92.6% had the condition on the left with a younger onset age, and 85.2% presented with a history of digestive system diseases, surgery, trauma or digestive system manifestations. The onset of giant pulmonary bullae was mild, without haemodynamic abnormalities, and 66.7% of the patients were males. Cystic lung lesions occurred mainly in infants. Among 45 cases, 93.3% were misdiagnosed by chest X-ray, which showed 'pseudo-pneumothorax line', with compressed lung displaced centrifugally away from hilum. In DH, the diaphragm appeared indistinct without gastric bubbles, whereas the air-fluid level might be noted. Finally, 66.7% of patients were definitely diagnosed from computed tomography scans and others by thoracotomy, thoracic drainage, X-ray after gastric tube insertion, and so forth. Thoracic tube drainage was performed in 91.1% of patients, with 24.4% of patients draining fluid, and 9.8% of patients deteriorated after drainage. A total of 41.5% of patients suffered complications, including gastric perforation, haemopneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema. Except for 1 patient who did not report the treatment and prognosis, all other patients recovered and were discharged after treatment. Distinguishing PTP from TP is clinically challenging. A thorough medical history, detailed clinical features, chest X-ray, ultrasound, computed tomography and strategic gastric tube insertion can provide important information of value for differential diagnosis. Clinicians need to think twice before placing a thoracic drainage tube to prevent additional iatrogenic injury."

    "abstract": "Isolated mesenteric injury often results from traffic accidents causing blunt abdominal trauma, exhibit nonspecific symptoms and signs. Most mesenteric injuries occur concurrently with injuries to other organs, such as the liver and spleen. As a result, the incidence of isolated mesenteric injury is very low and often misdiagnosed. A 49-year-old male patient presented with abdominal pain following a traffic accident more than 5 hours before admission. Upon admission, his blood pressure was normal but dropped sharply in a short time and presented with shock. Anemia, abrasions in the upper abdomen, cold skin on the dorsum of the foot, rebound pain, muscle tension, and noncoagulation of abdominal blood were all observed during the physical examination. Emergency plain and contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT), and mesenteric artery CT angiography revealed a large volume of blood accumulated in the abdomen, pelvis, and jejunal mesentery. The jejunal wall and mesentery were edematous, with mesenteric distortion, and some branches of the inner jejunal artery were not clearly visualized. We found no evidence of liver or splenic rupture. Mesenteric injury of the jejunum caused acute hemorrhagic anemia and hemorrhagic shock. An emergency laparotomy was performed. An emergency laparotomy showed 3 hematomas close to the perforation site, 2 fully split tears in the jejunal mesentery, bleeding from partially exposed veins, a significant amount of blood and clots in the abdominal cavity, and serosal damage at the jejunal mesentery's root. The patient recovered well after we performed abdominal cavity drainage and jejunal mesenteric hemostasis and repair. Isolated mesenteric injuries are very rare in clinical practice, and their clinical symptoms and signs are nonspecific, which makes them prone to misdiagnosis and oversight. When a patient satisfies the 4 requirements listed below: abdominal hemorrhage or hematoma; a history of abdominal trauma; no damage to high-risk organs like the liver or spleen; the CT-detected signs of mesenteric injury. Abdominal paracentesis or laparoscopy should be conducted to confirm the diagnosis and initiate further treatment."

Among these, herniation through a mesoappendix defect is exceedingly rare. To our knowledge, SBO due to a mesoappendiceal defect has only been described in a limited number of cases. In this case, a 76-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a two-day history of acute lower abdominal pain, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension. Diagnostic imaging revealed a partial small bowel obstruction with two transition points. During diagnostic laparoscopy, a loop of proximal ileum was found herniating through a mesoappendix defect, resulting in a closed-loop obstruction. The herniated bowel was viable and was successfully reduced, followed by an appendicectomy. The postoperative recovery was uneventful. This case highlights the need to consider internal hernias in the differential diagnosis of SBO, even in patients with prior abdominal surgeries."

Herein, we present the case of a 65-year-old female who developed stercoral ulceration of the transverse colon, an uncommon location of occurrence. The patient had multiple comorbid conditions and risk factors for stercoral colitis that included a history of constipation, major depressive disorder, hypothyroidism, and a partial colonic resection due to an upper rectal perforation secondary to diverticulitis. With features of peritonitis on physical examination, historical, and computed tomography findings, the patient underwent urgent open abdominal exploration with colonic resection of the impacted bowel and end transverse colostomy. The patient had a complicated postoperative course owing to a respiratory infection and intraabdominal abscess formation but adequately recovered to be discharged home. Thus, urgent surgical intervention is necessary for survival in patients with stercoral ulceration, but modification of risk factors may be crucial in preventing stercoral colitis and its potentially fatal complications."

Methods: This was an observational study. Indications for solo-SLA surgery were as follows: (1) computed tomography or ultrasound findings suggestive of acute appendicitis, accompanied by a high white blood cell count and C-reactive protein concentration; (2) disease course exceeding 72 hours, standard anti-infection treatment ineffective, inflammatory reaction not localized, surgery mainly aimed at abscess drainage, and the appendix removed if indicated intraoperatively; (3) acute onset stabilized for more than 3 months after conservative treatment; and (4) recurrent chronic appendicitis. Relative contraindications comprised: (1) cardiopulmonary insufficiency, extremely high risk for general anesthesia for laparoscopic surgery; (2) severe coagulation dysfunction; and (3) imaging findings suggestive of formation of a peri-appendiceal abscess, stable after anti-infection treatment, and a tendency for the inflammatory reaction to localize. We retrospectively collected clinical data of 106 patients with complicated appendicitis who had undergone solo-SLA in the Department of Emergency Surgery, Peking University People's Hospital from February to October 2023. Preoperative computed tomography showed appendiceal fecaliths, blurring of the tissue surrounding fat, intra- and extra-luminal gas and exudate, peri-appendiceal abscess, ascites, and intestinal obstruction by appendicitis. The study cohort comprised 53 male and 53 female patients aged (41.4±17.4) years. The median body mass index was (24.2±3.6) kg/m2 and median preoperative body temperature (37.3±0.9)℃ Appendicitis had been present for >3 days in 21 of the patients (19.8%) and the maximum diameter of the appendix was (12.4±3.8) mm. The efficacy of the surgery was assessed and logistic regression analysis used to explore the factors affecting the duration of the procedure. The relationship between the maximum diameter of the appendix and duration of surgery was non-linear and was explored using a logistic regression model with restricted cubic spline (RCS). Results: Only one patient required conversion to open surgery; all the other patients successfully completed solo-SLA with a median intraoperative blood loss of 10 (1-100) ml and a surgical time of (65.4±31.7) minutes. Pain scores on postoperative Day 1 and 7 were (3.4±3.2) points and (1.5±1.7) points, respectively. There were no significant postoperative complications .The postoperative hospital stay was (3.5±1.5) days and the interval to resuming normal activities 14 (2-40) days. According to univariate and multivariate analyses, disease course >3 days (OR=5.19, 95%CI: 1.59-16.98, P=0.006) and C-reactive protein >10 mg/L (OR=1.01,95%CI: 1.00-1.02, P=0.003) were independent risk factors for surgical duration >60 minutes, whereas the maximum diameter of the appendix was not independently associated with duration of surgery (OR=1.10, 95%CI: 0.97-1.25, P=0.119). RCS analysis results showed a \"U-shaped\" association between the maximum diameter of the appendix and duration of surgery, the inflection point of the RCS curve being at a diameter of 10 mm. When the maximum diameter of the appendix was <10 mm, increases in diameter were not associated with longer duration of surgery (OR=1.15,95%CI: 0.55-2.58, P=0.710); whereas when the diameter was ≥10 mm, the maximum diameter of the appendix was associated with increased duration of surgery (OR=1.20, 95% CI: 1.04-1.42, P=0.022). Conclusion: The solo-SLA procedure can be performed to treat complicated appendicitis. A disease course >3 days, C-reactive protein concentration >10 mg/L, and maximum diameter of the appendix ≥10 mm are all associated with greater difficulty of solo-SLA surgery. 目的： 探索影响免机械臂辅助下单人单孔腹腔镜阑尾切除术（SSLA）在复杂性阑尾炎患者中的应用及其危险因素。 方法： 本研究采用观察性研究方法。SSLA手术适应证：（1）CT或超声结果提示急性阑尾炎，白细胞计数及C反应蛋白升高；（2）病程超过72 h，规范抗感染治疗无效，且炎性反应未局限，手术以脓肿引流为主要目的，结合术中具体情况切除阑尾；（3）急性发作经保守治疗后病情稳定3个月以上；（4）反复发作的慢性阑尾炎。相对禁忌证：（1）心肺功能不全，全身麻醉手术及腹腔镜手术风险极高；（2）凝血功能严重障碍；（3）影像提示已形成阑尾周围脓肿，且抗感染治疗后病情稳定，炎性反应有局限趋势。回顾性收集2023年2—10月期间于北京大学人民医院急诊外科接受SSLA的106例复杂性阑尾炎患者临床资料，术前CT表现为阑尾粪石、周围脂肪模糊、腔内外积气渗液、阑尾周围脓肿、腹水和肠梗阻性阑尾炎。男性和女性各53例，年龄（41.4±17.4）岁。体质指数为（24.2±3.6）kg/m2，术前体温（37.3±0.9）℃，阑尾炎发病病程>3 d者21例（19.8%），阑尾最大径（12.4±3.8）mm。观察手术疗效，并采用Logistic回归分析探讨影响阑尾切除术手术时长的相关因素，采用限制性立方样条（RCS）的逻辑回归模型探讨阑尾最大径和手术时长的非线性关系。 结果： 全组患者除1例中转开腹之外，其余均顺利完成SSLA，中位术中失血量10（1~100）ml，手术时间（65.4±31.7）min。术后第1和7天疼痛评分分别为（3.4±3.2）分和（1.5±1.7）分，术后未出现明显并发症；术后住院时间（3.5±1.5）d，恢复正常活动时间14（2～40）d。单因素和多因素分析结果显示，发病病程>3 d（OR=5.19，95%CI：1.59~16.98，P=0.006）和C反应蛋白>10 mg/L（OR=1.01，95%CI：1.00~1.02，P=0.003）是导致手术时长>60 min的独立危险因素，而阑尾最大径并非影响手术时长的独立因素（OR=1.10，95%CI：0.97~1.25，P=0.119）。RCS分析结果显示，阑尾最大径与手术时间之间存在“U形”关联，RCS曲线的拐点在直径为10 mm处。当阑尾最大径<10 mm时，直径增加不会影响手术时长（OR=1.15，95%CI：0.55~2.58，P=0.710）；当最大径增大至≥10 mm时，阑尾最大径增加提示手术时长增加（OR=1.20，95%CI：1.04~1.42，P=0.022）。 结论： SSLA术式可应用于复杂性阑尾炎手术中，发病病程>3 d和C反应蛋白水平>10 mg/L以及阑尾最大径≥10 mm均可提示SSLA手术可能难度大。."

    "abstract": "Gallbladder perforation occurs in 2% to 11% of patients with acute cholecystitis, with associated mortality estimated to be at 12% to 42%. Because of its low incidence, the data on management remain sparse. There is a lack of evidence to suggest whether early or delayed cholecystectomy is superior in the treatment of perforated cholecystitis. We hypothesize that an early definitive operation is associated with decreased total hospital length of stay (THLOS). Using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from the American College of Surgery, we identified patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallbladder perforation on an urgent or emergent basis from 2012 to 2021. We divided them into those who underwent early (<2 days from the date of admission to the date of operation) and delayed cholecystectomy (≥2 days from the date of admission to the date of operation). Our primary outcome was the THLOS. We created multivariate regression models to assess for the association of early versus delayed operation and THLOS. The THLOS was found to be 2.94 days longer in the delayed group compared with the early group (p < 0.05). In those who did not present with sepsis on admission, the THLOS was noted to be 4.71 days longer in the delayed group compared with the early group (p < 0.05). Early versus delayed operation was not associated with a difference in the postoperative length of stay, 30-day postoperative complications, rate of readmission, and reoperation, regardless of preoperative sepsis status. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallbladder perforation is associated with decreased THLOS, and there were no other differences in outcomes compared with delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients with gallbladder perforation would likely benefit from an early operation within 2 days of admission. Therapeutic/Care management; Level IV."

It is most frequently encountered in intra-abdominal or pelvic surgeries, and while preventable, it remains a significant risk. We present a case of a 44-year-old female who underwent total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) a year ago and presented with right lower abdominal pain, distension, and vomiting. Ultrasonography suggested acute appendicitis and intestinal obstruction, prompting an open appendectomy. During surgery, a retained surgical gauze was discovered 25 cm proximal to the ileocecal junction. The gauze was removed via enterotomy, and the enterotomy was repaired. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery. Gossypiboma often occurs in abdominal or pelvic surgeries, with risk factors such as emergency surgeries, high BMI, and excessive bleeding. Literature shows the incidence from 1 in 1000 to 1 in 1500 abdominal operations. It can lead to foreign body reactions like encapsulation, abscess formation, or transmural migration through the intestine. Symptoms can be delayed, and complications may include obstruction or perforation. Diagnosis is challenging but can be aided by imaging like CT scans. Prevention is the key but retained surgical sponges require surgical removal. Gossypiboma, though uncommon, poses a significant risk after abdominal surgeries and can present with vague, nonspecific symptoms, delaying diagnosis. Strict adherence to surgical protocols, including accurate sponge counts and careful intraoperative monitoring, can help prevent the occurrence of retained foreign bodies and their subsequent complications."

    "abstract": "Small intestinal diverticula are rare compared to colonic diverticula. Jejunal diverticulosis can occur in older men. These diverticula are usually asymptomatic but can present with acute abdomen when symptomatic. Complicated cases can present with perforation, peritonitis, and abscess formation. CT scan is the ideal imaging modality to diagnose perforated jejunal diverticulitis. Complicated cases warrant surgical intervention. A high clinical suspicion is necessary for the timely diagnosis of perforated diverticulitis. We are presenting a case of a 45-year-old who presented with an acute abdomen in a surgical emergency. Perforated jejunal diverticulitis was revealed as the cause of his symptoms during surgery. This case signifies the importance of varied clinical presentations of perforated jejunal diverticulitis and keeping it in the differentials of acute abdomen. Perforated diverticulitis has a high mortality rate, so timely management is of utmost importance."

    "abstract": "Acute Appendicitis, a surgical emergency, is one of the most common causes of acute abdomen. Its' immediate diagnosis and surgery are of immense significance for the disease itself and its surgery carries a potential risk of morbidity and mortality. The goal of this study was to find out the role of Neutrophils to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) in making a confident diagnosis of acute appendicitis in a facility limited setup. It is a cross-sectional validation study on 100 patients admitted to the surgical wards of Ayub Teaching Hospital Abbottabad, with suspicion of Acute Appendicitis (AA), who subsequently underwent open appendectomy. Data were collected regarding the demography (name, age, gender) of the patient, physical examination, clinical presentations, and investigations including the complete blood count, from which the NLR value was calculated. Data was also collected regarding the histopathology examination of the appendix. The sensitivity was 70.65% while the specificity was 87.5% and accuracy was 72%. Positive Predictive Value (PPV) was 98.4% and NPV was 20.6%. There is a strong correlation between NLR value and Acute Appendicitis. According to the results of our study, NLR ≥ 2.5 seems to be a reliable parameter to obtain a more certain diagnosis of Acute Appendicitis."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction is a common surgical emergency. Laparoscopy has been increasingly used for the treatment of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO), but its indications remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify the risk factors for conversion to open surgery after laparoscopic ASBO treatment and evaluate the impact of conversion on short-term outcomes. All patients diagnosed with ASBO who initially underwent laparoscopic approach after the failure of conservative treatment between December 2020 and May 2024 were reviewed. Patients were categorized into two groups based on the surgical approach: the totally laparoscopic group (group 1) and the conversion to open surgery group (group 2). The demographic, clinical, and radiological features were compared, and risk factors were identified via univariate and multivariate analyses. The intraoperative findings and postoperative outcomes were evaluated. A total of 102 patients (43 in group 1 and 59 in group 2) were included. The time between home and admission (P ​= ​0.014) and the abdominal wall ratio (P ​< ​0.001) were significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1, whereas the number of prior abdominal surgeries (P ​= ​0.010) and the rate of beak signs were significantly lower in group 2 than in group 1. The operative time (P ​< ​0.001), blood lost (P ​< ​0.001), medical expenses (P ​< ​0.001), total hospital length of stay (P ​< ​0.001), and postoperative hospital length of stay (P ​< ​0.001) were significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1. Multivariate analysis revealed that a large abdominal wall ratio (odds ratio [OR]: 4538.7; 95 ​% confidence interval [CI]: 8.5-2426334.8; P ​= ​0.009) was a risk factor for conversion, whereas the presence of beak signs (OR: 0.186; 95 ​% CI: 0.05-0.64, P ​= ​0.008) was a significant protective factor. A large abdominal wall ratio is an independent risk factor for conversion, whereas the presence of beak signs is a protective factor. The conversion from laparoscopic surgery to open surgery is safe with proper management of conversion indications."

    "abstract": "We present a case of a carrier mother treated with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) for in-utero management of meconium ileus in a fetus diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (CF), homozygous for the F508del variant. Following multidisciplinary discussion and shared decision-making involving the parents, ETI was initiated at 27 weeks of gestation. At 38+4 weeks, the infant was delivered. Despite the treatment, the newborn developed meconium ileus, necessitating emergency surgery after birth. We explore potential factors contributing to the lack of success in our case compared to previously reported successful cases in USA and Spain. Drug levels measured in neonatal blood and in maternal breast milk indicated minimal drug exposure, raising questions about whether variability in placental transfer and excretion in breast milk or suboptimal ETI dosing in the overweight mother impacted the outcome. Additionally, the natural variability in meconium ileus outcome, which can range from spontaneous resolution to severe complications must be considered. In our case, ETI may have mitigated the severity of the condition, preventing serious complications like bowel perforation or peritonitis. However, given that about 20 % of all fetal bowel dilation resolves spontaneously, it remains uncertain whether the positive outcomes in prior cases were attributable to ETI or the natural course of the disease. We emphasize the need for more evidence on in utero ETI exposure by advocating for the collection of cases involving ETI treatment for fetal meconium ileus, regardless of outcomes. Developing guidelines will be essential to optimize benefits for both mother and fetus while minimizing risks."

    "abstract": "Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-related coronary perforations are rare but life-threatening complications of percutaneous coronary interventions. An older woman underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for a severely calcified stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending artery. During IVUS advancement after rotational atherectomy, a longitudinal coronary perforation occurred, resulting in cardiac arrest. Rapid deployment of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was initiated, followed by multiple covered stents and emergency coronary artery bypass grafting. Although balloon hemostasis and pericardiocentesis had not yet been performed, no signs of tamponade on fluoroscopy made us decide on the initial ECMO deployment, which resulted in an excellent outcome without significant myocardial damage and neurologic deficits. Rapid ECMO and a multidisciplinary heart team approach are vital for rescuing lives without serious sequelae. In addition, careful IVUS manipulation and thorough evaluation are essential in high-risk coronary interventions."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstructions (SBOs) are a burden to healthcare. Despite a common disease, significant inconsistencies exist within management, specifically use of small bowel follow through (SBFT). We evaluated patients who had SBFT and the early vs late use of SBFT on outcomes. A retrospective chart review was performed for 799 patients with SBO admitted between 2012 and 2019. Patients between 18 and 89 years of age were included and those who required emergent operations on admission were excluded. The groups were evaluated by having SBFT compared with not, and further delineated on SBFT performance before (early) or after (late) 48 hours. Of the 799 patients with an SBO, 757 (94.7%) had SBFT and 42 (5.2%) did not. Of those 757, 476 (62.8%) performed early and 281 (37.1%) completed late. In patients who received SBFT, the length of stay (LOS) was shorter (p < 0.003). If patients were admitted to the surgical service, they were more likely to receive an SBFT (p < 0.0042). When SBFT was early, patients were more frequently admitted to an academic institution (p < 0.0001) and to a surgical service (p < 0.0001), had decreased LOS (p < 0.001), decreased readmissions (p < 0.0001), were less likely to require surgery (p < 0.0009), had decreased time to operation (p < 0.0001), and had quicker operation to discharge (p < 0.0005). The use of SBFT for SBO resulted in improved outcomes, especially if performed early. This is supportive of surgical service admission with more frequent early SBFT with decreased LOS. There is a propensity for those patients with previous operations to have SBFT later in hospital stay and may correlate with increased need for surgery, and the use of early SBFT may help resolve SBO. Implementing early SBFT may improve outcomes and an area of future endeavors."

    "abstract": "Intestinal perforation and intestinal obstruction are common emergency surgeries in clinics which often require intestinal resection and anastomosis. Most intestinal anastomosis can be completed by laparoscopy. The wound closure module In the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) program is traditionally used for laparoscopic suture and knotting training. However, many young surgeons tend to focus on practicing suture techniques from certain or a limited range of angles. This narrow approach increases the difficulty of complex suturing and knotting in clinical scenarios such as laparoscopic intestinal anastomosis. To address this issue, we designed a multi-angle suture module specifically for suture and knotting training. Thirty-six second-year surgical residents were recruited for the study. Twelve residents were randomly divided at a 1:1 ratio into the traditional suture group and the multi-angle suture group according to their basic laparoscopic surgical ability. After training, they were required to perform laparoscopic end-to-end anastomosis surgery on isolated swine intestines. The operation times, goal scores and surgical performance scores of the surgeries were collected and compared. Trainees who used the multi-angle suture training module shortened the operation time (3375.7 ± 1000 s vs. 4678.2 ± 684.7, p = 0.008) and achieved better surgical effects (operation performance score: 8.2 ± 1.5 vs. 6.83 ± 1.3, p = 0.041) in end‒end intestine anastomosis surgery than did those who used the traditional suture training module. The multi-angle suture training module effectively improved the laparoscopic suture skills of trainees and is therefore a better choice for laparoscopic suture and knotting training before doing laparoscopic intestinal anastomosis."

    "abstract": "Umbilical hernia (UH), quite prevalent in pediatric population, may rarely present with serious complications like incarceration or viscus organ strangulation. An incarcerated hernia is the one which cannot be reduced back whereas, strangulation results when blood supply to the entrapped tissue is compromised. A 2-year-old female child, with history of reducible umbilical swelling since birth, presented in the emergency department with signs of acute obstruction. Examination favored an irreducible umbilical hernia to be the cause of the patient's clinical condition. Provisional diagnosis was further strengthened by emergency investigations including abdominal ultrasound and x-ray abdomen. Exploration after adequate resuscitation was planned. However, an unusual finding of intestinal perforation due to date seed was found. Entrapment of omentum appears to be the most common cause of obstructed UHs. Incarceration due to foreign body is rarely observed in umbilical hernias. This case highlights the importance of considering unusual etiologies in medical practice. There is relative lack of data regarding management options for obstructed umbilical hernia and this case is an effort to enrich current literature. Parental education plays a pivotal role in dealing with anxiety as well as executing proper management plan."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common emergency, but its variable presentation can delay diagnosis and treatment, leading to severe complications. Necrotizing fasciitis, although rare, can arise as a life-threatening consequence of perforated appendicitis. Prompt recognition and intervention are crucial to prevent fatal outcomes. A 23-year-old male presented with right iliac fossa pain and vomiting. Physical examination revealed tenderness and rebound tenderness in the right iliac fossa, with an Alvarado score of 7/10 and leukocytosis, suggestive of acute appendicitis. Emergency laparotomy revealed a perforated appendix with purulent fluid, which was drained, and abdomen was irrigated. Postoperatively, the patient initially stabilized but deteriorated on the second postoperative day. A CT scan revealed multiple abscesses and necrotizing fasciitis of the abdominal wall. Re-exploration with abscess drainage and debridement was performed, but the patient developed septic shock and multiple organ failure, leading to his death. This case underscores the potential for severe complications like necrotizing fasciitis following perforated appendicitis, even in previously healthy individuals. Delays in diagnosis and imaging, as well as reliance solely on clinical judgment, can contribute to adverse outcomes. Early recognition of necrotizing fasciitis and aggressive management, including broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical debridement, are essential to improve survival in such cases. Delayed diagnosis and management of acute appendicitis can result in rare but fatal complications such as necrotizing fasciitis. This case emphasizes the importance of timely intervention, imaging, and a high index of suspicion to mitigate mortality in these uncommon but severe presentations."

    "abstract": "Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is associated with high mortality rates. There are multiple challenges to establishing an accurate early diagnosis and providing state-of-the-art care for AMI patients. A high index of suspicion is key for early diagnosis. Once suspicion is raised, a triphasic computed tomography angiography is the essential diagnostic tool. Avoiding delays, using hybrid operating rooms and contemporary revascularization techniques for arterial occlusive AMI, can significantly improve the prognosis. Regional health care systems should be developed to direct AMI patients into centers with sufficient capabilities for providing all aspects of care at all hours. The acute care surgeon has a central role in performing laparotomies and bowel resections when needed and coordinating the management flow in close collaboration with vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists for prompt and effective revascularization. A significant share of patients with an arterial occlusive AMI can be managed by endovascular revascularization without the need for a laparotomy. There are no reliable tools for predicting transmural bowel necrosis, and individual assessment and clinical experience are very important in decision-making when choosing between laparotomy and close observation. During laparotomy, an atherosclerotic occlusion at the root of the superior mesenteric artery can be stented by using a retrograde open mesenteric or percutaneous approach, and surgical bypass is seldom needed. Using hospital-specific management pathways is very useful for the standardization of care in arterial occlusive AMI. In venous AMI, systemic anticoagulation is sufficient in most cases. In patients whose symptoms do not resolve, there are various options for endovascular and surgical revascularization. In nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia, prevention by maintaining sufficient abdominal perfusion pressure is key. High-level evidence is scarce, but with current knowledge, the prognosis of AMI patients has plenty of room for improvement."

Identification of patients at high risk of strangulation or failure of non-operative treatment is difficult. In this multicentre prospective observational study, prediction models for strangulation and non-operative treatment failure in adhesive SBO were developed. This study was carried out in three Finnish hospitals between June 2014 to May 2022. Patients with CT-confirmed adhesive SBO and prospective case report forms were included. The main outcomes were strangulation defined by operative finding of any intestinal ischaemia and failure of non-operative treatment within 30 days from admission. The model was developed using binary logistic regression, internally validated by bootstrapping and then externally validated. Of 626 patients, 481 were included; 355 patients formed the model development group and 126 formed the external validation group. Strangulation occurred in 58 (16%) patients and non-operative treatment failed in 93 (31%) patients in development cohort. The following six variables were included in the risk model for strangulation and non-operative treatment failure: neutrophil-leucocyte ratio, number of previous SBOs, abdominal guarding, mesenteric changes and free abdominal fluid, closed loop sign, and faeces sign on CT. In the development cohort, the optimism corrected area under the receiver operator characteristics curve for the strangulation model was 0.860 (95% c.i. 0.808-0.917), and 0.751 (95% c.i. 0.694-0.816) for the non-operative treatment failure model respectively. At external validation, the models retained their discrimination and demonstrated stable calibration. A clinically relevant prediction model to predict strangulation and non-operative treatment failure in adhesive small bowel obstruction has been developed."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous uterine perforation due to pyometra is a rare but serious condition. Pyometra refers to the accumulation of purulent material within the uterine cavity, typically resulting from an obstruction of the cervical canal combined with infection. When left untreated, the pressure from the accumulated fluid and the inflammatory response can lead to spontaneous uterine rupture. This condition often presents as an acute abdomen and can be life-threatening particularly in postmenopausal women. We present the case of a 71-year-old woman, para 8, who presented with acute abdomen characterized by generalized peritonitis. Diagnostic imaging revealed a fluid-filled, thickened endometrium with a complex pelvic collection. Emergency laparotomy revealed uterine fundal perforation with approximately 2 L of purulent material in the peritoneum. Subtotal hysterectomy + bilateral salpingo- Oophorectomy and extensive peritoneal lavage were performed. Cultures identified Citrobacter freundii, sensitive to multiple antibiotics, guiding effective postoperative treatment. Early surgical intervention is critical to prevent complications such as sepsis and multiorgan failure, which significantly contribute to the high morbidity and mortality rates of this condition. This case underscores the need for prompt recognition and aggressive management of pyometra-related uterine perforation in postmenopausal patients."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency, and perforated appendix is one potential complication. Acute appendicitis can be complicated by perforation and peritonitis, but chronic abscess formation is less common. This report presents the case of a 45-year-old woman with a 7-day history of right lower-abdominal pain and swelling due to perforated acute appendicitis and abdominal wall abscess that required laparotomy and drainage. The presentation of this particular case is unique in that a fistulous tract formed subsequent to perforation of the appendix, with the resultant abscess forming in the abdominal wall. The current case study serves to showcase the diagnostic challenges associated with such a presentation. CASE REPORT A 45-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 7-day history of right lower-quadrant and midline lower-abdominal pain and swelling. Computed tomography (CT) scans with intravenous (IV) and rectal contrast showed an abdominal wall abscess with no signs of obstruction, perforation, or appendicitis. Incision and drainage of the abdominal wall abscess with debridement of the abdominal wall was complicated by peritoneal adhesions, and open laparotomy was thus performed. Upon entry into the abdominal cavity, the appendix was found to be adherent to the abdominal wall. It was noted that the appendix had perforated, allowing for fistula formation with the abdominal wall. CONCLUSIONS Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for perforated appendicitis in cases of abdominal wall abscesses with leukocytosis and right lower-quadrant pain, even when initial imaging does not show obvious appendicitis."

This study investigated whether a standardized transition of care bundle could enhance health-related quality of life (HRQoL), reduce readmission rates, and increase days alive and out of hospital after major emergency abdominal surgery. A single-centre before-and-after study including consecutive patients undergoing major emergency abdominal surgery was conducted at Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2023. A transition of care bundle including standardized discharge coordination, written material, and multidisciplinary information meetings for patients and relatives was implemented on 1 January 2023. Patients were followed up by phone interviews and hospital records. HRQoL was assessed by the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. A total of 667 patients were included (before group 333 patients (median age 70.9), after group 335 patients (median age 72.2)). The predominant surgical procedure was emergency laparotomy for bowel obstruction (before group: n = 187, 56.2%, after group: n = 171, 51.5%).

    "abstract": "Lead perforation is a rare but potentially fatal complication of cardiac device implantation. Atrial lead perforations, though less common than ventricular ones, can have severe consequences, especially in elderly patients with underlying structural heart disease. An 83-year-old male with amyloid and valvular cardiomyopathy underwent dual-chamber pacemaker implantation for third-degree atrioventricular block following transcatheter aortic valve implantation. The active-fixation atrial lead was positioned on the right atrial free wall. Six hours post-implantation, the patient developed haemodynamic instability. Echocardiography revealed a small pericardial effusion, while pacemaker interrogation showed an increased atrial pacing threshold. Chest imaging demonstrated a moderate right haemothorax. Initially, conservative management was recommended. However, the patient's condition deteriorated, progressing to cardiac arrest requiring brief cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Emergency sternotomy revealed a large right haemothorax and laceration of the right upper pulmonary vein in contact with the atrial lead screw. The laceration was repaired, and the atrial lead was repositioned. The patient recovered well and was discharged 5 days after surgery. Lead perforation is an uncommon but potentially severe complication of pacemaker implantation, with an incidence of 0.5-1% of cases. Several risk factors have been identified, including advanced age, low body mass index, atrial remodelling, and lateral lead placement. In this case, the atrial lead perforation extended from the atrial wall to the right superior pulmonary vein. This case underscores the potential risks associated with lateral lead positioning in geriatric patients and emphasizes the necessity for meticulous lead placement and vigilant post-implantation monitoring to mitigate complications."

    "abstract": "Large bowel obstruction is a possible complication in patients undergoing neoadjuvant treatment for rectal cancer; however, it may be prevented by placing a pretreatment defunctioning stoma. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate complication rates in patients with rectal cancer undergoing long-course neoadjuvant therapy, comparing those with and without a prophylactic stoma. All patients with rectal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant therapy between 2007 and 2022 in Region Västerbotten, Sweden, were identified using the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Registry. Patients not planned for curative long-course neoadjuvant therapy and those requiring a stoma due to urgent bowel-related issues before treatment were excluded. The primary outcome was the incidence of complications between diagnosis and resection surgery or end of follow-up. The secondary outcomes were 30-day complications following resection, time to treatment (neoadjuvant therapy and surgery), and overall survival. Multivariable regression analysis was used, with adjustment for age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists fitness grade, and clinical tumour stage. Of 482 identified patients, 105 were analysed after exclusion. Among these, 22.9% (24 of 105) received a pretreatment stoma, whereas 77.1% (81 of 105) received upfront neoadjuvant therapy. The complication incidence before resection in the group with a defunctioning stoma and in the group without a defunctioning stoma was 75.0% (18 of 24) and 29.6% (24 of 81) respectively. A considerable number of complications were directly caused by the stoma surgery. Patients in the stoma group had an adjusted OR of 6.71 (95% c.i. 2.17 to 20.76) for any complication. However, for 30-day complications following resection, an adjusted non-significant OR of 2.05 (95% c.i. 0.62 to 6.81) was documented for the stoma group, in comparison with the control group. Neoadjuvant treatment was also delayed for the stoma group (adjusted mean time difference: 21 (95% c.i. 14 to 27) days), whereas the difference was not significant for the time to resection surgery. The median survival after diagnosis was 4.7 years in the stoma group and 12.2 years in the control group (P = 0.015); however, adjustment in the multivariable analysis rendered the estimate non-significant (HR 1.71 (95% c.i. 0.93 to 3.14)). Patients with rectal cancer who receive a stoma before long-course neoadjuvant therapy, in the absence of urgent symptoms, experience more complications than those without a stoma and a delay with regard to the start of neoadjuvant treatment."

The first group (A) used 500 mL of 1% povidone iodine for subcutaneous wound irrigation, while the second group (B) used 500 mL of normal saline for subcutaneous wound irrigation. Wound irrigation was done after an appropriate surgical procedure had been carried out based on the pathology. Wounds were assessed for SSI for up to 30 days after operation using the definition criteria by the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). SSI rates were compared between the two groups. Fifty-eight consecutive patients with generalised peritonitis over a one-year period were enrolled in this study, but 53 patients who completed the study were analysed. Thirty patients were males and 23 were females, and their mean age was 40.83 ± 17.96 years. Overall, 15 (28.3%) patients had incisional SSI. There were nine (34.6%) cases in the povidone group, while there were six (22.2%) in the saline group. This difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.32). Klebsiella species were the dominant organisms isolated from the infected wounds. Wound irrigation with povidone iodine after laparotomy for peritonitis did not reduce the rate and severity of surgical site infection more when compared to normal saline. We suggest further studies with a large number of patients in a multi-centre study to explore further the effect of povidone iodine versus normal saline wound irrigation on SSI following laparotomy for peritonitis."

    "title": "Strangulated Intestinal Obstruction due to Appendiceal Tourniquet: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Intestinal obstruction is a common surgical emergency. It has many causes, which may be either benign or malignant. However, appendicitis is not a common cause of intestinal obstruction, hence the challenge in making a diagnosis. Radiological and clinical diagnoses of this could be difficult; hence, diagnosis is mostly intraoperative. This case study involved a 54-year-old male, who presented at Edward Francis Small Teaching Hospital with features of acute intestinal obstruction for 5 days. During surgery, a gangrene of a loop of the bowel was found with an inflamed and partly gangrenous appendix, forming a tourniquet around the loop of the bowel. Appendicectomy and resection of the gangrenous bowel were performed. The postoperative period was uneventful. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 12. We publish this case report to add to the existing literature. In addition, no such case has been reported in the subregion. Appendicitis is not common in the age group in our case study, which makes it different from other cases presented in literature."

    "abstract": "Acute cholecystitis due to unintended cystic artery embolism is an uncommon and mostly self-limiting complication after transarterial chemoembolization procedure for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Usually, conservative management is sufficient for complete recovery of patients who develop this complication. If conservative treatment is ineffective, urgent surgical intervention may be required to prevent the progression of complications. This article reports a rare and serious case of acute cholecystitis complicated by gallbladder necrosis and biliary peritonitis, which was initially treated conservatively but eventually necessitated emergency laparotomy. The patient initially presented with equivocal symptoms of fever and upper abdominal pain and distention, which worsened at the two weeks mark along with emergence of signs of peritonitis. This was managed by emergency laparotomy and cholecystostomy, allowing rapid symptom relief. The patient ultimately discharged and succumbed to advanced liver cancer 11 months after diagnosis. After cholecystostomy, the patient showed symptom relief and was discharged, surviving 11 months post-stage IIIB liver cancer diagnosis."

    "abstract": "We present herein a case with the relatively uncommon presentation of isolated gastric perforation resulting from blunt trauma of the abdomen following a fall shortly after eating in a 5-year-old girl. The child experienced severe abdominal pain, tachycardia, hypotension, and shortness of breath. A physical examination revealed epigastric tenderness and abdominal distension. Initial X-ray was non-diagnostic, and a contrast-enhanced Computerised Tomography [CECT scan] demonstrated ascites and pneumoperitoneum that suggested hollow organ perforation. The emergency exploratory laparotomy revealed a 7 cm laceration on the stomach that was surgically repaired using two-layer closure. Following that, extensive peritoneal lavage occurred. In the postoperative period, the patient developed systemic inflammatory response syndrome [SIRS]. Hence, the PICU provided inotropic support and oxygen therapy. On the fourth day, she became significantly improved, and on the tenth day, we made her able to go home without any complications. The important points in the management of gastric perforation in paediatric blunt abdominal trauma are early suspicion, further imagination, and timely surgical intervention."

Elective surgical treatment, once a common intervention in General Surgery departments, is now nearly obsolete. Surgical treatment is reserved solely for complications, which occur in approximately 10% to 20% of cases. Perforation is the most common indication for surgery in peptic ulcer disease and accounts for nearly 40% of deaths from the disease. Treatment success depends on various factors, with early diagnosis and immediate surgical intervention being highlighted. Perforation is associated with a high incidence of morbidity and mortality. This article aims to analyze the different aspects related to the treatment of perforated peptic ulcers and define the best therapeutic approaches."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) complications following cardiac surgery are infrequent, but associated with high rates of postoperative mortality. The aim of our study was to identify risk factors predisposing patients to GI complications following cardiac surgery and describe the outcomes of patients suffering a GI complication. This was a retrospective cohort study of 6769 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgeries (at least one of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), aortic valve replacement, mitral valve replacement, or surgery on thoracic aorta) at a single Scottish centre between 1 January 2015 and 27 September 2023. Cohort demographics, intra-operative details and postoperative outcomes were compared between patients who did and who did not experience a gastrointestinal GI complication. Patients who experienced a GI complication had greater rates of thirty-day mortality (14.4% vs 2.4%, p < 0.001) and in-hospital mortality (6.8% vs 1.1%, p < 0.001) compared with those who did not. We identified previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (Odds ratio (OR) 2.27 [1.24-4.17], p = 0.007) and combined cardiac surgery (OR 1.67 [1.02-2.74], p = 0.043) as two risk factors for developing a GI complication, in addition to several previously identified risk factors (postoperative atrial fibrillation, postoperative vascular complication, use of pre-operative inotropes and increased age). GI complications frequently occur in elderly, co-morbid patients and in conjunction with other complications. Particularly lethal are mesenteric ischemia, GI bleeding, and small bowel obstruction. Extra caution should be observed in the patient group undergoing more than one cardiac procedure or those with a prior history of coronary artery disease. Prompt emergency laparotomy is a potentially life-saving intervention in promptly diagnosed patients, but confers a high risk of intra-operative and thirty-day mortality."

    "abstract": "Denture ingestion, commonly seen in older adults, can also occur in younger individuals. Most dentures require intervention as they cannot be excreted naturally. We report a case of a young male undergoing laparoscopic surgery to remove dentures impacted in the descending colon two months post-ingestion. A 30-year-old male presented with intermittent left lower quadrant abdominal pain for three days. He had accidentally swallowed his dentures two months earlier. Abdominal X-ray showed a radiopaque foreign body in the descending colon. Endoscopic retrieval attempts failed, necessitating urgent surgery. The dentures were removed successfully through laparoscopic surgery, and the perforation was closed using continuous horizontal PDS 4.0 sutures. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on postoperative day four. Denture ingestion poses a significant risk due to the nature of the object, often requiring removal as it cannot pass through the gastrointestinal tract. Removable dentures are a known risk factor for such accidents. Diagnosis typically involves abdominal X-rays or CT scans. Endoscopic retrieval is often attempted first but carries a risk of perforation, which may require emergency surgical intervention. Surgical approaches depend on the location and extent of perforation and the patient's abdominal condition. Early laparoscopic intervention should be considered in cases where surgery is indicated, as it offers a minimally invasive and effective solution."

Consequently, many cancer patients have developed life-threatening complications during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on colorectal cancer (CRC), including its clinical and pathologic characteristics. This multicenter cohort study was performed at six institutions in Korea and included a total of 3871 patients with CRC treated between March 2019 and February 2021. After exclusion of 211 patients who did not undergo surgery, the data of 3660 patients were compared 1 year before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The patients' baseline characteristics, CRC-related complications, perioperative outcomes including emergency surgery, R0 resection rates, stoma formations, postoperative complications, and pathologic outcomes were assessed. The number of patients decreased during the pandemic (- 18.0%, from 2127 to 1744), but the baseline characteristics did not differ. The pandemic group had greater disease severity given the presence of bleeding, perforation, and obstruction as complications (9.8% vs. 12.7%, P = 0.033). The proportion of patients who had open surgery (15.9% vs. 17.6%, P = 0.049), stoma formation (11.9% vs. 15.4%, P < 0.001), early postoperative complications (13.5% vs. 17.5%, P = 0.001), and adjuvant chemotherapy increased in the pandemic group (45.5% vs. 50.1%, P = 0.003). The clinical and pathologic features of CRC partly worsened during the pandemic.

Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of right iliac fossa pain; however, its occurrence on the left side is exceedingly rare and often leads to diagnostic delays, which may result in serious complications such as peritonitis if not promptly addressed. Imaging modalities, particularly computed tomography (CT), play a critical role in the anatomical and pathological diagnosis, thereby guiding appropriate surgical management. We present the case of a 67-year-old patient with a history of ileocecal tuberculosis, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke, who was admitted with left iliac fossa pain, initially suspected to be due to sigmoiditis. A CT scan revealed situs inversus with high-positioned left-sided appendicitis, prompting the indication for urgent laparoscopy. Surgical exploration confirmed a retrocecal appendicitis with minimal peritoneal effusion, and an appendectomy was performed."

    "abstract": "Gallbladder volvulus (GV) is a rare surgical emergency characterized by the twisting of the gallbladder around its mesentery, leading to vascular compromise and gangrene. It is often misdiagnosed as acute gangrenous cholecystitis due to overlapping symptoms, making preoperative diagnosis challenging. Definitive identification is typically made intraoperatively. Contributory factors include advanced age, female gender, low body mass index, and increased gallbladder mobility. Urgent surgical intervention is crucial to prevent severe complications such as perforation and biliary peritonitis. We report a case of an elderly woman with a low BMI who had a history of right hemicolectomy for locally advanced cecal cancer and ongoing immunotherapy for pelvic recurrence. She presented with acute epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting but no fever or jaundice. Examination revealed a tender upper abdomen with a palpable mass. Laboratory investigations showed leucocytosis with unremarkable CRP, liver, and renal function tests. A CT scan demonstrated a grossly distended midline gallbladder with a swirl sign at the cystic pedicle, consistent with GV. Supportive management was given, followed by urgent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Intraoperatively, a gangrenous gallbladder twisted 360° twice around its mesentery was identified and safely removed without complications. The patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged within 48 hours. This case underscores the diagnostic challenges of GV and highlights the importance of a high index of suspicion, particularly in elderly, frail patients with risk factors. Imaging findings such as the \"swirl sign\" and midline crossing of the gallbladder on CT scan aid preoperative diagnosis. Urgent surgical intervention remains the cornerstone of management, as delayed treatment can result in significant morbidity."

    "abstract": "Background: Despite advancements in prevention and treatment, peptic ulcer disease (PUD) remains a public health burden, with potentially high mortality rates when not managed properly. Recent studies indicate bleeding as the most prevalent complication, followed by perforation or penetration into adjacent organs and pyloric obstruction. In rare cases, posterior wall or greater curvature ulcers of the stomach can penetrate, leading to splenic artery pseudoaneurysms. With nonspecific symptoms and low incidence, it is highly important that these entities are not overlooked in the diagnosis of patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Case Report: We present the case of a 44-year-old patient presenting for upper abdominal pain and haematemesis while being haemodynamically stable. Emergency ultrasound described a dysmorphic spleen, with a transonic image with a Doppler signal in the splenic hilum. Upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy detected a blood-filled stomach, without the possibility of identifying the bleeding source. The CT scan revealed active bleeding with peri splenic haematoma. Intraoperatively, a posterior gastric wall penetration into the spleen was identified, and an atypical gastric resection and caudal splenopancreatectomy were performed. The postoperative course was marked by the identification of a staple line leak in the upper pole of the stomach, which was treated conservatively, with a favourable outcome, and the patient was discharged after two weeks. Conclusions: Upper gastrointestinal tract haemorrhage needs fast intervention and suitable management. The multidisciplinary team plays a key role in identifying and treating rare causes such as penetration into the splenic hilum."

    "abstract": "An intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) is a widely utilized contraceptive method. However, in rare instances, it may lead to severe complications such as strangulated intestinal obstruction. This paper presents a case involving an elderly female patient who developed acute abdominal pain and was subsequently diagnosed with strangulated intestinal obstruction attributed to an ectopic IUCD. The patient's initial symptomatology included upper abdominal pain and severe vomiting, which led the clinician to perform only an upper-abdominal CT scan, yielding no significant findings. Following three days of conservative management, the symptoms persisted without relief. The patient continued to experience abdominal pain, accompanied by abdominal distension, and a cessation of both flatus and bowel movements. Consequently, a comprehensive abdominal CT scan was performed, revealing bowel obstruction with peritonitis. An urgent laparotomy was subsequently undertaken. Due to the necrotic condition of the bowel, a resection of the affected segment was performed, followed by a one-stage end-to-end intestinal anastomosis after the removal of the intrauterine device (IUCD). By the ninth postoperative day, the patient had recovered sufficiently to be discharged from the hospital. This case underscores the importance for women with an IUCD to regularly assess the device's position and depth to prevent serious complications. It is also advisable to remove the IUCD promptly upon reaching the end of its effective lifespan or following menopause. Clinicians should be vigilant in monitoring and addressing abdominal pain in women with an IUCD."

Abdominal CT showed thickening of the small intestinal wall and findings of intraperitoneal free air. Suspecting peritonitis due to small intestinal tumor perforation, we performed an emergency surgery. A ruptured tumor measuring 50 mm in diameter was found in the jejunum about 15 cm from the Treitz' ligament and the partial resection of the small intestine was performed. Histopathology revealed fistulous necrosis within the tumor, and immunostaining was positive for KIT and CD34, leading to the diagnosis of jejunal GIST. He was evaluated as high risk for recurrence and was indicated for adjuvant chemotherapy. He is currently taking imatinib and is being followed up for 6 months without recurrence. Although diagnosing GIST of small intestine can be difficult, GIST of small intestine with perforation is at high risk of recurrence and rezuires adjuvant chemotherapy.

A 66-year-old female patient with primary signet ring cell carcinoma of the cecum and peritoneal carcinomatosis underwent a right colectomy with extended small bowel resection. Two months later, she presented to the emergency department with a partial small bowel obstruction, and laboratory studies revealed a markedly elevated lactic acid level. The patient's lactic acidosis levels remained persistently elevated despite supportive interventions, and she passed away on the fifth day of hospitalization. Cancer cells may overproduce lactate through aerobic glycolysis, known as the Warburg effect.

    "abstract": "The rising growth of patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) associated with chronic liver disease (CLD) and refractory chronic heart failure (CHF) associated with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) complicated by ascites presents serious renal replacement therapy (RRT) challenges. Haemodialysis is often poorly tolerated owing to increased hemodynamic instability, bleeding, and encephalopathy risks. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) has emerged as a promising alternative, but its adoption and efficacy are not consistently supported by existing literature, and there lacks guideline consensus. We thus used a scoping review approach to more accurately map the literature on PD practice and outcomes in this population. We identified 18 observational studies involving 627 ESKD patients with CLD/ascites and 222 advanced CKD patients with CHF/ascites. We found practice patterns revealing higher adoption of PD for CLD/ascites in Asia, reflecting the heavier regional PD and viral hepatitis penetration, while there was unique usage for CHF in Western settings. Across contexts, PD demonstrated adaptability for diverse patient profiles. PD as urgent-start and incremental therapy enabled both long-term controlled paracentesis and dialysis while maintaining haemodynamic stability, optimal nutritional status and particularly in CHF improved symptom control, reduced hospitalisation, and lowered diuretics reliance. Mechanical complications were rare and typically manageable whilst peritonitis rates were comparable without impacting technique failure. Survival outcomes were also comparable or superior. Our findings add valuable insights to PD as a feasible and safe long-term RRT option across the ascitic CKD spectrum. Broader consensus is nonetheless needed on its expansion as a first-line therapy and bridge to both palliation and transplantation."

Standard imaging methods include ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18 F-FDG PET/CT), typically used for oncology, can incidentally detect appendicitis through increased radiotracer uptake associated with inflammation. The paper discusses two cases where acute appendicitis was identified during PET/CT scans conducted for cancer evaluations. In cancer patients, diagnosing appendicitis is difficult due to overlapping symptoms from chemotherapy, metastasis, or radiation effects. Clinicians and radiologists must remain vigilant for incidental appendicitis findings in PET/CT scans, as early diagnosis can prevent complications despite its rarity in oncology imaging."

However, spontaneous idiopathic pneumoperitoneum, particularly in pregnant patients, is rare and poorly understood. This case report details a 41-year-old female, 24 weeks pregnant status post two rounds of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), who presented unresponsive after a suspected overdose. Initial assessments revealed abdominal distention and a CT scan indicated substantial intra-abdominal free air. An exploratory laparotomy was performed, which, surprisingly, showed no evidence of perforation or ischemia in any abdominal organs. Following surgery, the patient remained stable, was extubated on postoperative day one, and progressed to a regular diet, although she declined recommended psychiatric care for substance use disorder. This case highlights the diagnostic complexities of pneumoperitoneum in pregnancy, suggesting that factors such as trauma, physiological changes, and substance-related gastrointestinal dysmotility may contribute to this condition. The absence of identifiable perforation emphasizes the potential for benign causes, necessitating a multidisciplinary approach to effectively address the needs of pregnant patients with acute abdominal symptoms."

Cecal foreign body is a rare cause of cecal perforation. We report a 35-year-old male from China who initially exhibited symptoms suggestive of acute appendicitis. However, during a minimally invasive colonoscopy procedure, the authors found that a wooden toothpick caused the perforation. The patient presented to our emergency department with a 2 days history of right lower abdominal pain and low grade fever. The patient was in good health and had eaten fish 2 days earlier. Physical examination revealed mild pain with positive rebound tenderness in the right lower abdomen. However, computed tomography of the abdomen confirmed a strip of high-density shadows protruding beyond the intestinal cavity outline, with a small amount of peritoneal seepage in the ileocecal area. Combined with the medical history, the possibility of foreign body perforation by a fishbone and peripheral peritonitis were considered. However, the high-density shadow was identified as a wooden toothpick, which was removed via a minimally invasive procedure using a foreign body forceps under colonoscopy. The patient's condition improved significantly within 5 days after treatment. We emphasize the importance of a detailed patient history, accurate diagnosis and proper treatment in patients with acute abdomen."

We evaluated the clinical research capacity of several Canadian paediatric emergency departments (EDs) and described both the challenges experienced in the implementation of the PRIMED study and the strategies which were used to improve local research capacity. Eleven paediatric EDs across Canada provided basic demographic and administrative data along with laboratory- and human-resource availability during the PRIMED study enrollment. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Fewer than half of the study sites (5/11, 45%) had access to a laboratory that would process research samples 24 hours per day. Four study sites (36%) only enrolled patients during business hours (8:00-17:00). There was no nighttime coverage for patient enrollment and sample collection. Only three study sites (27%) had enrollment hours that captured over 75% of the potential study participants. Over half of the study sites (6/11, 55%) developed novel processes to enable study success, for example, creating graduate student on-call schedules and hiring bioscience-trained site coordinators to process samples. Despite site-specific efforts to overcome resource barriers, the gap in clinical research capacity at academic paediatric EDs remains a significant concern.

    "abstract": "It has been reported that mechanical damage occurs when regurgitant flow from aortic regurgitation (AR) directly impinges on the anterior mitral valve leaflet (AML). However, only a few cases of mitral valve perforation have been reported. Previous reports suggest that AR in such cases tends to be Grade 3 or higher and that haemodynamic damage to the mitral valve due to AR may be proportional to its severity. On the contrary, no cases of mitral valve perforation due to mild AR have been reported. In 2011, a 56-year-old man presented with mild AR towards the AML, revealed on a transthoracic echocardiogram. In 2016, 3 months before admission, the patient had been experiencing intermittent fevers of over 40°C, which did not improve, and was referred to our hospital. A detailed examination revealed a vegetation on the AML where the aortic valve was displaced, and the site was perforated. The AR was mild to moderate. Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus oralis. From these results, a definitive diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE) was made. The patient had cerebral infarction and underwent semi-emergency surgery. This case indicates that even mild AR directed at the AML can damage the AML, raising IE risk. Consequently, mild AR deviation towards the AML should be considered a potential risk factor for AML IE."

The incidence of DH was 0.22% in the pre-BIS period and >6-fold to 1.36% in the post-BIS period. The median time of postoperative DH occurrence was 11 (range, 3-95) mo. Ten patients underwent elective surgery for DH repair, whereas 8 patients with severe abdominal pain or bowel obstruction underwent emergency surgery, 1 of whom underwent small bowel resection and anastomosis due to severe bowel incarceration. Using BIS was the only significant risk factor for developing DH ( p  < 0.001; odd ratio, 6.28; 95% confidence interval, 2.43-16.25). Early recognition and surgical repair of DH after LDH should be considered in living donors with unexplained abdominal or thoracic symptoms. Caution is advised when using peridiaphragmatic hemostasis with BIS in liver surgery. We recommend extending the postoperative follow-up of living donors to at least 3 y, including routine imaging screenings for DH."

    "abstract": "We present a case of left ventricular perforation and delayed cardiac tamponade after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) managed percutaneously. This report describes a novel technique for management of left ventricular perforation after TAVI. We performed elective transfemoral TAVI in a frail 85-year-old lady. Anatomical challenges included tortuous and horizontal aorta and a small left ventricular cavity. A 23-mm Sapien valve was implanted. She developed cardiac tamponade the next day needing emergency pericardiocentesis. Left ventricular angiogram showed perforation of the lateral wall. SURGIFLO Hemostatic Matrix was injected into the pericardial space using Agilis steerable introducer with a good outcome. Cardiac perforation and tamponade are serious and potentially fatal complications after TAVI. The outcomes in these patients remain poor with high mortality rate even with emergent cardiac surgery. This report describes a novel technique for management of left ventricular perforation after TAVI."

    "abstract": "Obturator hernia is a rare abdominal wall hernia (<1 % incidence) that occurs through the obturator foramen, often in elderly, emaciated women. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdomen and pelvis is the diagnostic modality of choice, with a high accuracy of 78 %-100 %. An 84-year-old frail woman with COPD presented with generalized abdominal pain, abdominal distention, vomiting, and right thigh pain. CECT revealed a right-sided obturator hernia causing small bowel obstruction. Emergency exploratory laparotomy revealed a right-sided strangulated obturator hernia. Postoperatively, the patient developed septic shock and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and succumbed to death on the 5th postoperative day. Obturator hernia is a rare abdominal hernia with an incidence of 0.07-1 %, an often-overlooked condition, more common in elderly women (around 70-90 years) with risk factors like low BMI, multiparity, and chronic conditions such as COPD. It presents with nonspecific symptoms, including abdominal pain, distension, and vomiting, and is often difficult to diagnose. Early CECT has improved the preoperative diagnosis rate from 43 % to 90 %, thus playing a crucial role in preventing morbidity and mortality. Treatment is surgical, but the mortality rate is high due to delayed diagnosis, bowel strangulation, and underlying preexisting illness. Obturator hernias are a rare but important cause of small bowel obstruction, especially in elderly, frail, malnourished women without prior abdominal surgeries. Medial thigh pain and mild abdominal distension warrant high suspicion and prompt diagnosis using CECT. Early surgical intervention is critical to prevent severe complications and reduce associated morbidity and mortality."

Clinically, it presents with symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting, which can be misinterpreted or overlooked, leading to diagnostic delays. We present an autopsy case of a 43-year-old woman with no significant past medical history, who initially consulted the Emergency Department for persistent abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea over a 10-day period. Despite symptomatic treatment, no further diagnostic investigations were conducted. Three days later, she presented a sudden loss of consciousness at home and she was declared dead shortly thereafter. A medico-legal autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death. External examination revealed cyanosis of the face and nails, abdominal distension, and no signs of trauma. At the internal examination, there were a stercoral peritoneal effusion of approximately 400 ml and multiple perforations in the colon, specifically in the ascending colon and sigmoid regions. Further examination showed an inflamed, hemorrhagic colonic mucosa. Histological analysis revealed deep ulcerations and areas of transmural inflammation alternating with healthy mucosa, typical of Crohn's colitis. No other organ abnormalities were noted. Toxicology tests were negative. The cause of death was attributed to peritonitis secondary to colonic perforation due to undiagnosed Crohn's colitis."

Complicated acute appendicitis may present as perforated or gangrenous appendicitis with a compromised appendiceal base. This is a challenging scenario for surgeons that may require, in some cases, an ileocolic resection. This study aims to demonstrate the advantages and efficacy of a minimally invasive approach to complicated appendicitis requiring ileocolic resection. Materials and Methods: We reviewed patients who underwent extended resection for complicated acute appendicitis at our hospital from January 2022 to May 2024. Baseline, preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative features were analyzed. Results: During the study period, 15 patients with acute appendicitis required laparoscopic extended resection. Nine (56.2 %) underwent ileocecal resection, and 6 (43.8%) underwent right colectomy. All patients had an intracorporeal side to side, isoperistaltic 60 mm mechanical anastomosis. Mean length of stay was 7 Ã+- 1.3 days with no CD III and IV complications. No postoperative abdominal abscesses or anastomotic leaks occurred. Conclusions: Totally laparoscopic approach is a safe procedure for patients with complicated appendicitis requiring ileocolic resection."

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools have been employed to improve the accuracy of various diagnoses, including appendicitis. The purpose of this study was to systematically review the current body of evidence regarding the efficacy of AL and ML approaches for the diagnosis of acute pediatric appendicitis. This systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to identify articles from Pubmed, Scopus, and iEEE Xplore. Study information, methodological details, and outcome metrics were extracted and summarized across studies. Quality of reporting was appraised using The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model of Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement. Fourteen studies were included in the final analysis of which ten were published after 2019. Two studies originated in the United States while half were carried out in Europe. Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest AI methods were the most commonly used modeling approaches. Commonly used predictors were pain and laboratory blood findings. The average area under the curve that was reported among the fourteen studies was greater than 80 %. AI and ML technologies have the potential to improve the accuracy of acute appendicitis diagnosis in pediatric patients. Further investigation is needed to identify barriers to adoption of these technologies and to assess their efficacy in real world usage once integrated into clinical workflows."

    "abstract": "Residual abscess is a major complication after emergency surgery for gastroduodenal (GD) perforation. However, there is little evidence regarding potential risk factors contributing to its development. Establishing a risk stratification strategy would be valuable for the entire management process. This single-center, retrospective study analyzed 115 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for GD perforation between 2010 and 2023 at a secondary emergency care hospital. Patients were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of residual abscesses. Potential risk factors for abscess formation were evaluated from various aspects. The incidence of residual abscesses was 19.1% (22 of 115). Multivariable analysis revealed that current use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (odds ratio [OR] 3.76, p = 0.037), cancer chemotherapy (OR 13.56, p = 0.005), and preoperative renal dysfunction (OR 4.72, p = 0.018) were independent predictors. A potential scoring model could be created using these three parameters, and the number of risk factors correlated with the likelihood of developing a residual abscess (0 vs. 1 vs. ≥2; 6.2% vs. 29.4% vs. 50.0%, p < 0.001). From a bacteriological point of view, the presence of Enterococcus in the ascites culture was closely related to its occurrence with 100% probability. Moreover, regarding early detection of this complication, C-reactive protein on postoperative d 5 had the highest predictive ability with an area under the curve of 0.818. The risk of residual abscess formation after surgical treatment of GD perforation can be assessed utilizing both preoperative and postoperative information."

The present case report describes the case of small bowel perforation due to an ingested chicken bone wherein a 35-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department with a complaint of lower abdominal pain for 2 days. Based on history and symptom review, initially, a working diagnosis of a case of the ruptured haemorrhagic cyst was given, while the ultrasonography findings of the abdomen and pelvis, also, pointed towards a similar diagnosis. As the symptoms worsened, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was advised to rule-out acute appendicitis, although, the CT findings revealed a foreign body perforating the small bowel. The patient was subsequently advised laparoscopy-assisted foreign body removal with segmental jejunal resection and an end-to-end anastomosis. The patient had an uneventful post-operative recovery, and was eventually, discharged on the 2nd post-operative day."

    "abstract": "Laparoscopic appendectomy is a common emergency surgical procedure worldwide, known for its benefits of reduced pain, shorter hospital stays, and quicker recovery times. Although postoperative care typically involves observation on the surgical floor, advances in surgical techniques and perioperative care have introduced the potential for discharging patients directly from the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). This study aims to evaluate the safety and cost-effectiveness of direct PACU discharge compared to traditional floor admission for patients undergoing uncomplicated laparoscopic appendectomy. This retrospective cohort study analyzed adult patients diagnosed with uncomplicated appendicitis between January 2021 and December 2023. Patients were divided into two cohorts: those discharged directly from PACU and those admitted to the floor before discharge. Primary outcomes included 30-day readmission rates, reoperation rates, and postoperative complications. Secondary outcomes assessed costs, surgery times, and demographic variables. Statistical analysis involved Pearson's chi-square tests, t-tests, and multivariate logistic regression. A total of 203 patients were included, with 103 in the PACU cohort and 100 in the floor cohort. PACU patients were younger and had fewer comorbidities than floor patients. No significant differences were found in 30-day readmission, reoperation rates, or complications between the groups. PACU discharge was associated with significantly shorter hospital stays (8 h vs. 26 h, p < 0.001) and lower costs, with average charges of $27,739 for PACU discharges versus $31,593 for floor discharges, primarily due to reduced labor costs. Direct discharge from the PACU following uncomplicated laparoscopic appendectomy is both safe and cost-effective compared to floor admission. These findings suggest that PACU discharge is a viable option for well-selected patients, with the potential for significant healthcare savings. Future research should focus on refining patient selection criteria and validating these findings in diverse healthcare settings."

This study developed a fully automated diagnostic framework using a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify appendicitis and clinical information from patients with abdominal pain, including contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic computed tomography images. A deep learning model-Information of Appendix (IA)-was developed, and the volume of interest (VOI) region corresponding to the anatomical location of the appendix was automatically extracted. It was analysed using a two-stage binary algorithm with transfer learning. The algorithm predicted three categories: non-, simple, and complicated appendicitis. The 3D-CNN architecture incorporated ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet. The IA model utilising DenseNet169 demonstrated 79.5% accuracy (76.4-82.6%), 70.1% sensitivity (64.7-75.0%), 87.6% specificity (83.7-90.7%), and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.865 (0.862-0.867), with a negative appendectomy rate of 12.4% in stage 1 classification identifying non-appendicitis versus. appendicitis. In stage 2, the IA model exhibited 76.1% accuracy (70.3-81.9%), 82.6% sensitivity (62.9-90.9%), 74.2% specificity (67.0-80.3%), and an AUC of 0.827 (0.820-0.833), differentiating simple and complicated appendicitis. This IA model can provide physicians with reliable diagnostic information on appendicitis with generality and reproducibility within the VOI."

A male in his 40s with vEDS presented with right lower abdominal pain. Computed tomography revealed a foreign body in the ileum with bowel perforation. A detailed inquiry revealed that he had consumed codfish six days prior. Based on these findings, he was diagnosed with a small bowel perforation caused by a fish bone. Emergency laparotomy was performed and intraoperative findings showed a fish bone in the ileum penetrating the mesentery. We resected ~5 cm of the small intestine, including the perforation site. Although the patient experienced postoperative paralytic ileus, he was discharged on postoperative Day 27. Gastrointestinal perforation caused by fish bones in patients with vEDS is extremely rare and requires careful assessment to determine the appropriate treatment.

Early identification of patients who require surgery eventually enables timely elective resection, which could decrease the chronic diverticular disease burden. This register-based nationwide cohort study aimed to investigate the incidence of emergency and elective colonic resections or stoma formation in patients with chronic diverticular disease and explore predictors for surgery. The study included all patients with chronic diverticular disease in Denmark from 1996 to 2020, defined as patients with two or more hospital contacts due to diverticular disease. The incidence of surgery due to chronic diverticular disease was calculated as cumulative incidence proportions. Predictors for surgery were explored in a Cox proportional hazard model. A total of 33 951 patients with chronic diverticular disease were included. The overall 5-year cumulative incidence proportion of surgery was 13.9% (elective surgery 9.8%, emergency surgery 4.2%). Patients with complicated chronic diverticular disease, including fistula, stenosis or perforation, had a three- to six-fold higher incidence of surgery overall than patients with uncomplicated chronic diverticular disease. The incidence of elective surgery decreased with age and co-morbidity and increased with the number of emergency admissions, even more pronounced if the emergency admissions accumulated within a shorter interval. Patients with chronic diverticular disease should be considered for elective colonic resection if they have complicated disease or several hospital contacts as they are likely to undergo surgery eventually."

By utilising two distinct X-ray energy spectra, DECT differentiates materials based on their attenuation properties, providing detailed insights into tissue composition and pathology. In emergency settings, DECT is used in thoracic imaging for the detection of pulmonary embolism, in abdominal imaging to enhance the diagnosis and characterisation of conditions such as pancreatitis, appendicitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and bowel ischaemia and in the genitourinary system for identifying kidney stones, pyelonephritis, and urinary bleeding. In neuroimaging, DECT enables image optimisation through virtual monochromatic images and the reduction of metal artifacts. It helps in the differential diagnosis of haemorrhage versus tumour-related haemorrhage, haemorrhage versus contrast extravasation, and in the dating of vertebral collapse. DECT offers several advantages, including enhanced visualisation, the potential to reduce radiation exposure and contrast medium, and improved diagnostic accuracy across a wide range of conditions. However, its routine clinical adoption is still evolving due to challenges such as limited availability, cost, and the need for specialised training. This pictorial essay aims to encourage the broader integration of DECT into emergency imaging protocols by showcasing its clinical applications and benefits."

It is extremely rare for patients with malnutrition after colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery to develop SBP. This is the first ever case reported case of SBP resulting from intestinal barrier compromise in a patient with colorectal cancer with malnutrition. A 72-year-old woman with malnutrition was diagnosed with CRC, and following brief nutritional support, she underwent the laparoscopic-assisted radical right hemicolectomy. The patient was then diagnosed with peritonitis after the operation. An emergency laparotomy was performed, and the patient was finally diagnosed with SBP. The patient ultimately recovered following a series of appropriate postoperative supportive treatments. This case highlights the poor outcomes of short preoperative nutritional therapy in CRC patients with malnutrition.

Both types may have delayed presentations, with abdominal organs protruding into the thoracic cavity, causing symptoms of varying severity. Pregnancy can sometimes precipitate the condition. Tension pneumothorax resulting from bowel perforation into the thorax is exceptionally rare, with only a few cases reported. To the best of the authors knowledge, this is the third documented case of a late-presenting trauma-related diaphragmatic hernia during pregnancy, complicated by tension pneumothorax. A 30-year-old woman, 29 weeks pregnant, was referred to Semmelweis University emergency department with moderate dyspnea. Initial investigation revealed tension pneumothorax. Chest tube placement released air, pus, and feces. Computer tomography identified a diaphragmatic hernia with bowel incarceration and perforation as the underlying cause. The patient underwent a delayed cesarean section and surgical repair, with a good outcome. A history of thoracic trauma eight years prior was later revealed. Evaluating pregnant patients with shortness of breath in the emergency department is challenging. Identifying a history of thoracic or abdominal trauma is crucial, as this can raise the suspicion of diaphragmatic hernia, which can present with a wide range of symptoms. Spontaneous tension pneumothorax in pregnant women is extremely rare and requires cautious management.

A 17-year-old black male student, with a body mass index of 28 kg/m2 was admitted to the emergency department of a 4th category rural hospital, with paroxystic abdominal pain and vomiting. Medical history revealed an abdominal surgery for an umbilical hernia 3 years earlier. There was no malformation such as imperforate anus, Hirschsprung's disease, esophageal tracheal fistula, or cardiac anomaly in the medical history. An abdominal X-ray confirmed an acute intestinal obstruction showing hydroaeric levels. The diagnosis of acute intestinal obstruction on a flange was retained. A median laparotomy was performed; a solid mass-like lengthy structure mimicking postoperative flange was seen associated with midgut volvulus, while a malposition of the intestine was observed with a mesenteric band, as well as a hyperemic appendix. A 90° rotation stop of the midgut also called a complete common mesentery was in place; we then carried out a Ladd procedure. Morpho-pathological examination of the surgical specimens revealed the following: richly vascularized fibro-adipose tissues with no evidence of malignancy in the diverticular specimen, and acute pan-appendicitis with no evidence of malignancy in the appendicular specimen. The patient started to ingest food orally on the third postoperative day, and he was discharged uneventfully on the fifth day. MD, although generally a tubular structure, may sometimes appear as a non-tubular mass during clinical examination. Intestinal obstruction due to MD associated with midgut volvulus is exceptional. Management of this association should be based on accurate knowledge of the morpho-embryological specificities during gut development."

    "abstract": "While the majority of colectomy for volvulus is performed by an open approach, laparoscopy can be used as a potentially safer alternative. However, conversion to open is needed when the laparoscopic approach is unsuccessful. This study aimed to compare the 30-day outcomes of patients who had converted open from laparoscopy vs planned open colectomy for volvulus to assess a possible \"laparoscopy first\" strategy. In addition, this study identified risk factors associated with the conversion during laparoscopy. National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) targeted colectomy database from 2012 to 2022 was utilized. Patients with volvulus as the primary indication for laparoscopic and open colectomy were selected. Patients who had a conversion from laparoscopic to open surgery and planned open surgery were further identified. A 1:5 propensity-score matching was applied to converted open and planned open to match sex, race and ethnicity, age, baseline characteristics, preoperative preparation, and indication for surgery (if emergent). Thirty-day postoperative outcomes were examined. There were 1774 (22.10%) and 6254 (77.90%) patients who underwent laparoscopic and planned open colectomy for volvulus, respectively. From laparoscopy, 336 (18.94%) patients were converted to open surgery and 1,680 planned open cases were matched to the converted open cases. After propensity-score matching, patients underwent converted open and planned open had a comparable mortality rate (5.06% vs 3.99%, p = 0.37). However, patients who underwent converted open surgery had higher risks of renal complications (2.68% vs 0.60%, p < 0.01), bleeding requiring transfusion (9.82% vs 6.55%, p = 0.04), and wound complications (17.86% vs 12.26%, p = 0.01). Risk factors associated with conversion from laparoscopic to open colectomy included perforation (aOR = 4.767, p < 0.01), obstruction (aOR = 2.223, p < 0.01), sepsis 48 h before surgery (aOR = 2.952, p < 0.01), chronic kidneys disease (aOR = 1.602, p = 0.01) and preoperative infection (aOR = 1.489, p = 0.03). These identified risk factors demonstrated both strong discriminative (c-statistics = 0.713) and predictive (Brier score = 0.132) powers for open conversion. While laparoscopy for colonic volvulus may offer safer outcomes, a ubiquitous \"laparoscopy first\" strategy may be approached with caution. The increased risks of complications upon conversion to open surgery, particularly in patients with identified risk factors, suggest that careful patient selection may be crucial."

    "abstract": "Introduction and Importance. Small bowel lymphomas, which represent <1 % of gastrointestinal cancers, are most found in the ileum due to its high concentration of gut-associated lymphoid tissue. T-cell lymphomas of the small bowel are particularly rare. While increased risk is noted in conditions like celiac disease and immunodeficiency, their occurrence in HIV/AIDS patients is uncommon and poorly understood. The rare complication of gastrointestinal perforation in these cases complicates diagnosis and management. 42-year-old woman with HIV/AIDS, on antiretroviral therapy for 4 years, presented with a 1-month history of progressively worsening abdominal pain, intermittent fevers, weight loss, and a productive cough. On physical examination, she was cachectic, febrile, and had generalized abdominal tenderness with signs of peritonism. Laboratory investigations revealed anemia, elevated CRP, and ESR, with a CD4 count of 441 cells/mcL. Imaging studies, including abdominal CT, showed free air and fluid suggestive of a perforated viscus. The patient underwent emergency laparotomy, which revealed multiple bowel perforations. Resection was performed, and histopathology confirmed small bowel T-cell lymphoma (anaplastic large cell lymphoma). Despite intensive postoperative care, the patient died on the fourth postoperative day. Small bowel T-cell lymphoma is rare, especially in HIV/AIDS patients, and poses significant diagnostic challenges. Its presentation is often nonspecific, and perforation is a serious complication. While chemotherapy and surgery are key treatments, T-cell lymphomas are more resistant to therapy, leading to a poor prognosis, particularly when complicated by perforation. This case highlights the rarity and complexity of small bowel T-cell lymphoma in HIV/AIDS, compounded by gastrointestinal perforation. Early diagnosis, advanced imaging, and multidisciplinary management are essential for improving outcomes. Further research is needed to optimize treatment strategies for this challenging case."

    "abstract": "Historically, urgent surgery was advocated in patients with suspected appendicitis because of the risk of perforation and possible complications. Although recent studies have shown that it is safe to delay surgery under certain circumstances, many studies do not report adjusted data and exclude patients based on risk factors. Furthermore, it is unclear whether an ultrasound-based diagnostic workup is sufficient to safely delay surgery. This large retrospective study aimed to analyze the risk-adjusted association between delayed appendectomy and perforation and complication rates. Data from consecutive patients who underwent appendectomy for suspected appendicitis at a single institution were reviewed and analyzed. The investigated outcomes were perforation and complication rates. Propensity score (PS) matching was used to create equal groups regarding confounding factors, and multivariate analysis was performed to control for risk factors and to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for in-hospital delay. Between January 2008 and June 2023, 4900 patients underwent appendectomy for suspected appendicitis. Ultrasound imaging was performed in 4754 patients. Multivariate analysis of PS-matched data showed no association between a waiting time of >12 h and perforation rate (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.67-1.31; P =.69) or complication rate (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.62-1.30; P =.56). Similar results were obtained for a waiting time of 18 h and perforation rate (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.48-1.56; P =.88) or complication rate (adjusted OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.57-1.68; P =.93). This large PS-matched analysis showed that it is safe to delay surgery by 12 and 18 h, even when the diagnostic workup is based on ultrasound. In patients with risk factors for complications, postponement of the procedure can be considered if it can improve overall conditions or allow the procedure to be performed with a higher level of expertise."

    "abstract": "Foreign body ingestions are a common problem in the emergency department. Patients often undergo invasive interventions that require significant resources. Current recommendations based on limited studies, are to attempt endoscopic removal of objects that are sharp or greater than 2.5 cm at or above the proximal duodenum. We hypothesized that many small and sharp objects will pass spontaneously without complication. We performed a retrospective study of all foreign bodies ingested by adults that were not removed initially by endoscopy over five years. We recorded foreign body size, shape and location, radiographic results, interventions performed, and demographic data. Regression analysis was used to determine any significant associations with the outcome of late intervention. 117 patients with 171 encounters met inclusion criteria with an average age of 33 years. 74 % of patients had a known psychiatric history. The most common foreign body was a razorblade. Fifteen patients had late intervention with twelve endoscopies and three exploratory laparotomies. 87 % of these late interventions were for failure to progress determined by the treatment team. There were no small bowel obstructions. One patient had a recto-sigmoid perforation from a pencil. Analysis indicates that size and sharpness were not significant risk factors for later intervention. Our study indicates that small objects, even sharp foreign bodies including razorblades, can pass spontaneously without intervention. If larger, future studies show the same conclusion, there should be a reconsideration of current guidelines."

    "abstract": "Horseshoe appendix is 1 of the rarest types of duplex appendix characterized by 1 appendix having 2 openings at the cecum. Clinically, it is extremely rare and is detected incidentally at surgery. Therefore, accurate and timely diagnosis is important for enhanced prognosis, treatment planning, and optimizing patient outcomes. This case report presents the first case of horseshoe appendix in France. A French 15-year-old boy, presented to the emergency department with pain in the right iliac fossa that had been worsening for 4 days. Considering his symptoms, abdominal ultrasound, radiological examination, and computed tomography (CT) scan results, an acute appendix was suspected. Acute appendicitis (AA) with \"horseshoe\" type appendix. Surgical intervention with exploratory laparoscopy was performed immediately. We found a heterogeneous image, partially fluid in the right iliac fossa, measuring approximately 16 × 9 mm, with inflammatory remodeling of the fat upon contact. The radiological examination concluded that complicated AA was suspected. Finally, the pathological report revealed acute suppurative appendicitis with peritoneal reaction. Horseshoe appendix is rare. Considering his symptoms, radiological examination, ultrasound, and CT scan results, an acute appendix was suspected. The patient was successfully treated using emergency surgery and antibiotics treatment thanks to further diagnosis via exploratory laparoscopy and pus microbial analysis."

    "title": "Diagnostic accuracy of convolutional neural network algorithms to distinguish gastrointestinal obstruction on conventional radiographs in a pediatric population.",
    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) dilatations are frequently observed in radiographs of pediatric patients who visit emergency departments with acute symptoms such as vomiting, pain, constipation, or diarrhea. Timely and accurate differentiation of whether there is an obstruction requiring surgery in these patients is crucial to prevent complications such as necrosis and perforation, which can lead to death. In this study, we aimed to use convolutional neural network (CNN) models to differentiate healthy children with normal intestinal gas distribution in abdominal radiographs from those with GI dilatation or obstruction. We also aimed to distinguish patients with obstruction requiring surgery and those with other GI dilatation or ileus. Abdominal radiographs of patients with a surgical, clinical, and/or laboratory diagnosis of GI diseases with GI dilatation were retrieved from our institution's Picture Archiving and Communication System archive. Additionally, abdominal radiographs performed to detect abnormalities other than GI disorders were collected to form a control group. The images were labeled with three tags according to their groups: surgically-corrected dilatation (SD), inflammatory/infectious dilatation (ID), and normal. To determine the impact of standardizing the imaging area on the model's performance, an additional dataset was created by applying an automated cropping process. Five CNN models with proven success in image analysis (ResNet50, InceptionResNetV2, Xception, EfficientNetV2L, and ConvNeXtXLarge) were trained, validated, and tested using transfer learning. A total of 540 normal, 298 SD, and 314 ID were used in this study. In the differentiation between normal and abnormal images, the highest accuracy rates were achieved with ResNet50 (93.3%) and InceptionResNetV2 (90.6%) CNN models. Then, after using automated cropping preprocessing, the highest accuracy rates were achieved with ConvNeXtXLarge (96.9%), ResNet50 (95.5%), and InceptionResNetV2 (95.5%). The highest accuracy in the differentiation between SD and ID was achieved with EfficientNetV2L (94.6%). Deep learning models can be integrated into radiographs located in the emergency departments as a decision support system with high accuracy rates in pediatric GI obstructions by immediately alerting the physicians about abnormal radiographs and possible etiologies. This paper describes a novel area of utilization of well-known deep learning algorithm models. Although some studies in the literature have shown the efficiency of CNN models in identifying small bowel obstruction with high accuracy for the adult population or some specific diseases, our study is unique for the pediatric population and for evaluating the requirement of surgical versus medical treatment."

    "abstract": "Rapid reperfusion is an important predictor of neurologic recovery in acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion (AIS-LVO) treated with mechanical thrombectomy (MT). We present a single-institution retrospective observational study of the ThrOmbectomy withOut Flushes or AnestheSia Teams (TOOFAST) technique, which eliminates continuous heparinized saline flushes and employs conscious sedation (CS) to streamline MT preparation. Retrospective review of prospectively collected data for AIS-LVO patients at our comprehensive stroke center from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2023. Patients were >18 years with premorbid modified Rankin Scale (mRS) <3. Cases were performed under CS without continuous pressurized heparinized saline flushes or anesthesiologist involvement. Cases were categorized as presenting to the emergency department or from inpatient units (in-house), outside hospital transfers, or those undergoing hyperacute MRI. Among 947 total cases, 638 were analyzed. 374 (58.6%) were in-house activations, 205 (32.1%) were transfers, and 59 (9.2%) underwent hyperacute MRI. Median presenting National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 15 (interquartile range (IQR) 9-20) and 34.7% of patients received intravenous thrombolysis. Median arrival-to-access and NIR-to-access times for in-house activations were 67 (IQR 56-80) and 39 (IQR 29-48) minutes, respectively. Embolization to new territory occurred in 11 (1.7%) patients while vascular perforation occurred in 9 (1.4%). Median NIHSS shift from admission to discharge was -9 (IQR -15 to -5). At 90 days, 46.5% (106/228) remained mRS <3. The TOOFAST technique may result in rapid access times with a profile of safety, procedural parameters, and neurologic outcomes comparable to published trial standards."

    "abstract": "The open abdomen (OA) technique is nowadays a worldwide strategy both for trauma and emergency general surgery. Despite the attempt at conducting prospective studies, a high level of evidence is far from established. The aim of this study was to investigate if we overused this strategy and if it improved the postoperative course of our patients. Emergency laparotomies from 2017 and 2023 were reviewed and stratified according to OA and closed abdomen (CA). Differences were balanced by inverse probability weighting, and the 90-day mortality was estimated. Subgroup analysis was carried out for patients with a Mannheim Peritonitis Index (MPI) of >26, bowel obstruction, bowel ischemia (BI) and gastrointestinal perforation. Of the 320 patients, 167 were CA and 153 were OA. Groups were different for American Society of Anesthesiologists, comorbidities, transfusion rate, Physiologic and Operative Severity Score for the Study of Mortality and Morbidity score, MPI, Clinical Frailty Scale score, diagnosis, and resection. Two balanced pseudo-populations were created. The 90-day survival rate was 50.8% for CA and 60.8% for OA (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; confidence interval [CI], 0.40-1.55; p = 0.502). At the Cox regression, the Clinical Frailty Scale score (HR, 1.125; 95% CI, 1.01-1.25; p = 0.033) and BI (HR, 5.531; 95% CI, 2.37-12.89; p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for mortality. Transfusion rate (odds ratio [OR], 3.44; 95% CI, 1.44-8.23; p < 0.006) and length of stay in the intensive care unit (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.07-1.20; p < 0.001) were associated with major complications. Open abdomen did not modify mortality in the case of bowel obstruction, MPI >26, or gastrointestinal perforation. Finally, OA (HR, 0.056; 95% CI, 0.01-0.22; p = 0.001) and large bowel resection (HR, 6.442; 95% CI, 1.28-32.31; p = 0.040) were predictors of longer survival in the subgroup of patients with BI. Open abdomen was not associated with a higher complication rate or higher mortality but did result in a longer in-hospital stay. The only setting where OA seemed to be advantageous was in the BI population. Prognostic and Epidemiological; Level III."

    "abstract": "Colonoscopy represents a safe procedure that is widely used in medical practice either to diagnose or treat various gastrointestinal diseases. During the last few years, the incidence rate of perforations in colonoscopic procedures has increased, especially in therapeutic colonoscopies. The recent advancements in endoscopic techniques and gastrointestinal tumoral resection procedures such as endoscopic mucosal resection, endoscopic full-thickness resection, and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) could be a risk factor for this increased risk. The incidence rate of mortality of serious colonoscopic perforations is 7.1%. The management plan for these perforations starts with conservative treatment in mild cases, endoscopic closure, and surgical management in severe cases. Recently, endoluminal vacuum therapy was found to be effective in the management of colorectal perforations and this has been reported in multiple case reports. This editorial provides an overview of the current guidelines for the management of iatrogenic colorectal perforations. These insights are from the perspectives of endoscopists and gastroenterologists. We also present a management algorithm based on the guidelines of the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, the American Gastroenterological Association, and the World Society of Emergency Surgery. We also discussed in brief the use of endoluminal vacuum therapy in colorectal perforations."

Its first symptoms are vague and in the majority of cases nonspecific, so the diagnostic suspicion is of the utmost importance to establish the correct diagnostic and prompt treatment. It is a complex and difficult event, that needs a multidisciplinary approach involving different specialties such as gastrointestinal and vascular surgeons, interventional radiologists, and expertise from the acute care unit team. The fundamental aspect is the precocity of diagnostic based on abdominal computed angio-tomography and the immediate re-establishment of blood supply to the affected areas. In this report, we introduce a case of a patient with mesenteric venous thrombosis, who has beenundergone a percutaneous endovascular treatment (portal-mesenteric mechanical thrombectomy, besides an intravenous thrombolytic infusion), due to poor clinical response after anticoagulation approach that needed mechanical ventilation."

However, gastrectomy is not a curative procedure, precludes oral intake, and may hinder palliative chemotherapy in patients with metastatic disease. The present study assessed the feasibility of a \"stomach-preserving strategy\" comprising peritoneal lavage and repair surgery for the management of gastric cancer perforation in patients with distant metastasis. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with gastric cancer who underwent surgical treatment at our hospital from 2013 to 2021. The clinical courses of patients who had undergone peritoneal lavage and repair surgery for perforated gastric cancer with distant metastasis were reviewed to evaluate postoperative outcomes. During the study period, 3,862 patients underwent radical gastrectomy. Additionally, nine patients with stage IV gastric cancer with distant metastasis prior to treatment underwent emergency surgery due to gastric perforation. Of the nine patients that underwent emergency surgery, seven patients underwent peritoneal lavage and repair surgery and two underwent peritoneal lavage only. No cases of secondary leakage were observed. Seven patients (78%) had a good postoperative course including the resumption of meals and continuation of chemotherapy. The remaining two died of sepsis. The median overall survival time was five months from surgery and 12 months from the initiation of palliative chemotherapy. A \"stomach-preserving strategy\" for the management of perforated gastric cancer is safe in patients with stage IV gastric cancer with distant metastasis and allows continuation of oral intake and palliative chemotherapy."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal duplication is a rare congenital anomaly, usually occurring in childhood and rarely in adults. It is most common in the ileum, but can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus. An adult case of intestinal duplication is accompanied by non-specific symptoms and, hence, it is often difficult to establish accurate diagnosis preoperatively in adults. We experienced two cases of ileal duplication that was manifested as acute abdomen. In both cases, we performed emergency surgery with a tentative preoperative diagnosis of perforation peritonitis related to intestinal duplication. The first case was a 36-year-old male presenting with a cystic non-communicating intestinal duplication, which was perforated, causing abdominal pain. The second case was a 77-year-old male presenting with tubular communicating intestinal duplication, in which a fecal stone was fitted into the root of the duplicated intestine, and the duplicated intestine itself became abscessed, causing abdominal pain. Their postoperative courses were uneventful and the patients were discharged from hospital without any sequelae on the 5th and 10th postoperative day, respectively. Although preoperative diagnosis is not easy, because the clinical presentation varies depending on the occurrence site, in-depth evaluation of preoperative CT images could lead to a precise diagnosis especially when considering intestinal duplication as one of the differential diagnoses of acute abdomen."

Herniation of the transverse colon (TC) is rare, especially when causing a closed-loop obstruction. A 67-year-old male with poorly controlled type II diabetes and hypertension presented with a symptomatic right inguinoscrotal hernia, showing nausea, vomiting, and partial bowel obstruction. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a herniated TC causing a closed-loop obstruction. Emergency open hernia repair with a modified Shouldice technique and mesh was performed. Viable TC and omentum were reduced. The patient recovered without complications and was discharged on the fourth postoperative day. This case involved a rare TC herniation causing a closed-loop obstruction, confirmed by CT imaging. The open approach was selected due to the risk of ischemia and anticipated adhesions. A modified Shouldice repair with mesh reinforced the inguinal canal, reducing recurrence risk. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. This case highlights the rarity of TC herniation causing closed-loop obstruction. CT scans were crucial for diagnosis, enabling prompt surgical intervention, which is key to preventing serious complications."

One week post-surgery, she presented with NSTI symptoms and haematuria, which were managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics and debridement. During her hospital stay, she experienced persistent urinary incontinence and burning micturition. Evaluation of these symptoms revealed acute intestinal obstruction, and a contrast CT indicated vesicouterine communication. Surgical exploration confirmed a perforated uterus with possible retained placental tissue, and a VUF. Subtotal hysterectomy and bladder repair were performed, and her recovery was smooth. This case underscores the importance of considering VUF in patients with post-caesarean urinary symptoms, despite its rarity."

While CA requires urgent surgical management, UC can be treated with antibiotic therapy in selected cases. However, accurate identification of CA remains a clinical challenge. This study aimed to identify factors associated with CA and to develop a diagnostic severity scale. Methods: In this retrospective study, we included 132 adult patients (>16 years) with a confirmed postsurgical diagnosis of appendicitis, of whom 52 had CA and 80 had UA. Signs, symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory values, and ultrasonographic findings were evaluated to determine predictive factors and construct a diagnostic scale. Results: The factors most significantly associated with CA were elevated plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein (>7.150 mg/dL), fibrinogen (481.5 mg/dL), International Normalized Ratio (INR) (>1.150), and the presence of free fluid periappendicular. The combination of these factors within one scale showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.84, with a sensitivity of 78.75% and a specificity of 82.69%. Conclusions: Serum C-reactive protein concentration, fibrinogen, and INR can be employed individually or as part of a scale as important indicators in diagnosing CA."

Initial computed tomography (CT) showed uncomplicated acute diverticulitis but despite antibiotic treatment, her condition worsened, and a follow-up CT revealed sigmoid perforation, requiring high anterior resection and subtotal hysterectomy. The case highlights how large fibroids exert external pressure on the colon, impairing motility and increasing the risk of diverticula formation. Alterations in the gut microbiome may contribute to colonic mucosal inflammation, commonly seen in diverticular disease. Patients with uterine fibroids have altered microbiome composition, which could further increase the risk of diverticular disease. These findings provide a pathway for future research into the influence of uterine fibroids on the pathophysiology of diverticular disease."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis and adnexal torsion associated with ovarian tumors are possible causes of acute abdomen in women, yet differentiation remains challenging. Once adnexal torsion is suspected in young women, gynecologists should perform surgery to release the torsion as promptly as possible to preserve future fertility. Herein, we report a case of acute appendicitis that was unexpectedly discovered during laparoscopic surgery initially performed for suspected torsion of a right ovarian teratoma. A 20-year-old nulligravid woman with a history of left ovarian teratoma resection and ulcerative colitis presented with left lower abdominal pain. Non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed no findings suggestive of exacerbation of ulcerative colitis, such as bowel wall thickening or worsening ascites, while a mass suspected to be an ovarian teratoma was identified. Gynecologists and an emergency physician specializing in gastroenterology who attended the patient suspected an acute abdomen caused by adnexal torsion or tumor leakage associated with a right ovarian teratoma 5 cm across. However, laparoscopy revealed that the right ovarian teratoma was neither twisted nor ruptured. Instead, the appendix was swollen with yellow turbid ascites, compatible with acute appendicitis. Therefore, laparoscopic excision of the right ovarian teratoma and appendix was performed, and the patient's pain resolved postoperatively. The assumption that the pain was caused by torsion of the right ovarian teratoma was the primary reason for failing to diagnose acute appendicitis. This underscores the importance of evaluating the appendix during gynecologic laparoscopic surgery performed for suspected ovarian torsion."

The diagnosis of intraperitoneal bladder rupture in rural places is difficult and is made at a late stage associated with complications leading to poor outcomes. We present the case of a 35-year old married black African man who had an isolated intraperitoneal bladder injury secondary to blunt abdominal trauma with an intact pelvis that occurred due to a road traffic accident. The clinical picture and the investigations done led to a laparotomy that revealed a bladder dome tear, which was repaired in two layers. The anatomical position of the urinary bladder in adults protects it from injuries because the pelvic bone surrounds it. The current guidelines recommend a surgical treatment for intraperitoneal bladder rupture. Computed tomography, with its ability to diagnose concomitant injuries, with retrograde cystography is the investigation of choice; however, deterioration of the patient's clinical picture or presence of signs and symptoms of peritonitis should lead to emergency laparotomy prior to further investigations. On-time diagnosis and accurate treatment constitute a pillar for the best outcome for the patient. There should be a high index of suspicion of intraperitoneal bladder rupture in a patient following blunt abdominal trauma, and the clinician should be alerted about it in case of deterioration or presence of signs and symptoms dictating laparotomy.

Due to the similarity between the symptoms of the disease and those of pregnancy, laboratory findings become particularly important in diagnosis. This study aimed to evaluate these parameters for the first time using a new index definition. Between 2015 and 2021, a total of 120 patients were included in the study, divided into the four groups: healthy pregnant woman (HPW), healthy woman (HW), unhealthy pregnant woman (UPW, pregnant patient with acute appendicitis), and unhealthy woman (UW, non-pregnant patient with acute appendicitis). Laboratory parameters, including white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), ischemia-modified albumin (iMA), and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), were assessed. In this study, significant differences were observed in various laboratory parameters between groups, such as WBC, CRP, NLR, and PLR, indicating potential markers for differentiating between pregnant women with and without appendicitis. An index was created for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in pregnant women and was named the Pregnant Index. The Pregnant Index (PGIndex) values of pregnant women without appendicitis were compared with those of pregnant women with appendicitis. It was found that the PGIndex value was significantly higher in pregnant women with appendicitis (p < 0.001). Using the ROC curve and Youden index, the PGIndex cut-off value to best differentiate between the two groups was 10.62. This value provided a sensitivity of 73.3%, specificity of 96.7%, positive predictive value of 95.7%, negative predictive value of 78.7%, and test accuracy of 85% for identifying pregnant women with appendicitis. Compared to other markers, the PGIndex had the highest accuracy value, and it was observed that patients with a PGIndex value above 10.62 had a significantly increased likelihood of having appendicitis. These results indicate that the PGIndex is a significant marker for detecting appendicitis in pregnant women. Laboratory parameters, particularly NLR and PLR, show promise as diagnostic tools for appendicitis in pregnant women. Incorporating these markers, the Pregnant Index (PGIndex) demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing between pregnant women with and without appendicitis. This is the first study using the Pregnant Index in pregnant women to diagnose appendicitis. Early diagnosis is crucial for preventing maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality associated with appendicitis during pregnancy."

While Mycobacterium chelonae is known to cause various ophthalmic infections, most commonly following surgery, there are no reported cases of infection by this microorganism in the context of acute hydrops, nor concurrent with Herpes Simplex virus 2 infection. A 33-year-old Portuguese woman of Caucasian ethnicity with a history of keratoconus presented with a red eye and ocular discomfort in the right eye at the Ophthalmology Emergency Department. Initial examination revealed acute hydrops with no epithelial defects nor signs of infection. Posteriorly, she developed dendritic epithelial lesions suggestive of Herpes Simplex virus infection. These lesions progressed, leading to a central corneal infiltrate and descemetocele. Due to perforation of the descemetocele, a tectonic penetrating keratoplasty was successfully performed, and coinfection of Herpes Simplex virus 2 and Mycobacterium chelonae was later confirmed through microbiological examination. This is the first reported case of corneal coinfection with Herpes Simplex virus 2 and Mycobacterium chelonae in the setting of acute hydrops. The combination of corneal edema, previous viral infection, and prolonged corticosteroid use likely created a \"perfect storm\" scenario, predisposing the patient to this unusual coinfection. Our findings highlight the need for heightened awareness of atypical infections in patients with acute hydrops and suggest that such complications may alter corneal barrier function. This case contributes to the understanding of complex interactions between corneal conditions and microbial infections."

In contrast to developed nations, where the usual causes of obstruction are adhesions, strictures, and metabolic derangements, infective etiologies, like tuberculosis and parasitic infestations, are more common in developing countries. We present a case report of a 22-year-old man presenting with acute intestinal obstruction due to a massive ascariasis infestation. The patient exhibited classical symptoms of intestinal obstruction, including abdominal pain, distension, and vomiting. Imaging studies revealed multiple air-fluid levels, suggesting a small bowel obstruction. Emergency surgical intervention was performed, and a substantial number of live worms were extracted from the small intestine, relieving the obstruction. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged with anthelmintic therapy and instructions for improved sanitation practices. This case underscores the importance of considering worm bezoars as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with acute intestinal obstruction, particularly in endemic regions, and highlights the significance of prompt surgical intervention for resolution. Additionally, it emphasizes the critical role of public health measures in preventing and managing parasitic infestations."

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of pediatric intussusception, including the presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence. Intussusception is one of the most common pediatric abdominal emergencies. This is associated with one part of the intestine telescoping into another, resulting in bowel edema. If the intussusception remains untreated, obstruction, ischemia, necrosis, and perforation may result. Most cases are idiopathic, with 10-25 % associated with a pathologic mass or lead point. The most common age group affected includes those between 3 months to 5 years. The triad of intermittent abdominal pain, currant jelly stool, and sausage-shaped mass is uncommon, though most patients will present with intermittent abdominal pain. Nonbilious emesis and bloody stools (gross blood or guaiac positive) are also common. Younger patients can present atypically, including altered mental status or lethargy. Thus, intussusception should be considered in pediatric patients with abdominal pain, emesis, and a sausage-shaped mass, as well as those with atypical presentations such as altered mental status or lethargy if there is no other etiology found on testing. The diagnostic modality of choice is ultrasound. Plain radiography may assist in evaluating for obstruction and perforation. Treatment includes prompt reduction of the intussusception. In patients who are stable and have no evidence of perforation, non-operative reduction with hydrostatic or pneumatic reduction should be attempted. Operative intervention is necessary in those who are unstable, peritonitic, or have a focal lead point. Discharge may be appropriate for patients following successful non-operative reduction if the patient is able to tolerate clear fluids, is asymptomatic, and can return for any recurrence of symptoms. An understanding of pediatric intussusception and its many potential mimics can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this high risk disease."

In this retrospective study, 761 radiology residents were assessed on five thoracic emergency cases using WIDI SIM over four years. Cases included bronchial disruption, septic emboli, ventricular perforation, pulmonary embolism, and a negative pulmonary CTA. Residents provided free-text interpretations, which were scored by faculty using a standardized point system. Scores and errors were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the Kruskal-Wallis test. Residents' performance varied across the five cases, with the highest average score on the negative pulmonary CTA (9.59) and the lowest on bronchial disruption (6.59). Observational errors were more common than interpretive errors. The Kruskal-Wallis test revealed significant differences in median scores across the cases (p < 0.0001), with pairwise comparisons showing significant differences in all but two comparisons. This study reveals significant variability in radiology residents' diagnostic accuracy in interpreting thoracic emergency cases, with a high prevalence of observational errors. Our observations emphasize the need for targeted educational strategies to address specific areas of weakness and improve diagnostic accuracy in this critical area of radiology practice."

    "abstract": "Acute necrotizing gastritis is a rare and life-threatening condition characterized by gastric gangrene in the absence of vascular compromise. Prompt recognition and surgical intervention are critical to prevent fatal complications. A 30-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a 3-day history of generalized abdominal pain along with coffee-ground vomiting and absolute constipation. Clinical evaluation revealed a febrile, dehydrated, and tachycardic patient with a tense, tender, and distended abdomen. Radiological investigations, including a CT abdomen, demonstrated gastric distension, air-fluid levels, thickened gastric walls, and prominent intramural gas along the greater curvature without evidence of perforation. Endoscopy typically reveals a purplish discoloration of the gastric mucosa, covered with necrotic debris. However, in this case endoscopy was avoided due to strong clinical and radiological suspicion of acute necrotizing gastritis, the patient's hemodynamic instability and potential risk of gastric perforation. Exploratory laparotomy revealed gangrenous changes involving the fundus and a longitudinal strip of gastric tissue along the greater curvature, with a width around a third of the stomach, sparing the lesser curvature and gastroesophageal junction. The longitudinal strip of gangrenous segment was resected, and the stomach was repaired using a double-layer technique. Histopathology confirmed gastric mucosal necrosis with neutrophilic infiltration, and tissue cultures revealed hemolytic streptococci. The patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful, and he was discharged on the 12th postoperative day. This case underscores the importance of considering acute necrotizing gastritis as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and gastric distension, even in the absence of traditional risk factors. Prompt surgical intervention is critical to avoid life-threatening complications. Further studies are needed to elucidate the pathogenesis and refine the management of this rare condition."

    "abstract": "Emergency surgery in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with elevated mortality and morbidity compared to elective operations. This study was conducted to identify the factors influencing both short and long term outcomes in emergent CRC operations, particularly in critically ill patients. This single center retrospective analysis focuses on patients with stage III or higher CRC who underwent emergency surgery and were admitted to the intensive care unit postoperatively. Among 64 patients, 46 presented with generalized peritonitis due to free perforation. Non-survivors at 90 days had a higher incidence of preoperative shock (53.3% vs. 4.1%, P = 0.000), elevated perioperative Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores (P = 0.000; P = 0.013), and fewer retrieved lymph nodes (LN) (P = 0.010). Multivariate analysis identified LNs retrieval as a significant predictor of 90-day mortality (AUC = 0.727). For overall survival, younger age, lower American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status, absence of metastasis, adjuvant chemotherapy (CTx), and lower LN ratio (LNR) were associated with improved outcomes. Multivariate analysis showed ASA physical status and adjuvant CTx as significant predictors. In predicting 3-year recurrence (51% of patients), the Random Forest model achieved 65% accuracy. Age and LNR were major predictors, with 0.01 unit increase in LNR raising recurrence risk by 1.025-fold and each additional year of age by 1.035-fold. The number of retrieved LNs was identified as a predictor of 90 day survival, ASA physical status and adjuvant CTx were identified as prognostic factors for overall survival, and age and the LNR were found to be predictors of disease recurrence within three years."

    "abstract": "Intraperitoneal bladder rupture is a rare complication of blunt abdominal trauma, occurring in less than 1 % of cases. Prompt diagnosis and surgical management are crucial to prevent severe complications. We report a 62-year-old male presenting with hypogastric pain and peritonitis following a low-impact fall. Imaging revealed intraperitoneal bladder rupture without pelvic fractures. Emergency laparotomy confirmed a 13 cm rupture of the bladder dome, treated with two-layer repair, cystostomy, and lavage. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, with complete bladder integrity confirmed after 15 days. Bladder trauma management depends on rupture type: extraperitoneal ruptures are typically managed conservatively, whereas intraperitoneal ruptures require surgical intervention. For intraperitoneal injuries, guidelines recommend laparotomy for repair and postoperative cystography. This case underscores the importance of recognizing rare presentations of bladder trauma and addressing underlying risk factors like urinary retention to improve patient outcomes."

While most cases are uncomplicated, some patients may require endoscopic or surgical intervention to prevent serious complications. Therefore, accurate and detailed radiological evaluation is essential for therapeutic decision-making. We present the case of an 80-year-old woman presenting with abdominal pain and radiological evidence of a foreign body in the small intestine. A conservative treatment approach was initially proposed due to the absence of complications and the hypothesis that a fishbone was the cause. However, her condition deteriorated due to bowel injury, complicated by bleeding and perforation. Multiplanar and 3D reconstructions identified the object as a medication blister located in the sigmoid colon. Urgent surgical intervention allowed for the retrieval of the object and the closure of the bowel perforation. This case highlights the importance of early, detailed, and accurate radiological evaluation to identify the characteristics of foreign bodies and guide timely intervention."

    "abstract": "Bowel obstruction is a common surgical emergency worldwide. It may result into high morbidity or mortality whenever intervention is delayed. It affects all age groups. The most commonly seen etiologies of bowel obstruction are post-operative adhesions, neoplasm and hernia in that order. Intestinal knot syndrome is an extremely rare cause of intestinal obstruction, and when it occurs, it poses diagnostic challenges. We report a case of appendico-ileal knotting causing strangulated small bowel obstruction due to its rarity and diagnostic difficulty. Our objective is to discuss the clinical presentation and management of this rare cause of surgical emergency. A-72- year old man was seen at the emergency unit of our center with 4 days history of gradual onset of colicky abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting. He had a two-day history of constipation and a one-day history of fever. He was acutely illlooking and his vital signs were abnormal. Urgent abdominopelvic ultrasound and plain abdominal x-ray was performed and were suggestive of intestinal obstruction. He had emergency laparotomy, and intra-operatively appendico-ileal knotting was seen with gangrenous appendix and terminal ileum. This necessitated limited right hemicolectomy and ileo-colonic anastomosis. The patient was managed post-operatively and discharged on post-operative day 10. Appendico-ileal knotting is a cause of small bowel obstruction although it is very rare. The diagnosis is commonly confirmed intra-operatively. There are reports of simple small bowel obstruction secondary to appendico-ileal knotting, but this case confirmed that it could also lead to strangulated intestinal obstruction."

    "abstract": "Gangrenous appendicitis, a type of complicated appendicitis, is an indication of emergency surgery due to a high risk of perforation. However, it can be challenging to diagnose preoperatively. This study aimed to validate the predictive factors of patients with gangrenous appendicitis and develop a novel scoring model based on objective parameters. This retrospective single-center study included 171 of 302 consecutive patients undergoing appendectomy between April 2014 and December 2023. Patients with perforation, chronic appendicitis, and appendicitis presenting with an abscess were excluded from the analysis. In other words, the study targeted Grades 1 and 2 on the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) severity assessment scale. Computed tomography (CT) scan value was defined as the average value of fluid in the appendix lumen on plain CT scan. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the independent objective predictors of gangrenous appendicitis. A new scoring model was developed based on the logistic regression coefficients of the independent predictors. The scores were then classified into three categories, and the probability of gangrenous appendicitis for each category was evaluated. Overall, 46 (27%) and 125 (73%) patients presented with gangrenous appendicitis (=AAST Grade 2) and non-gangrenous (uncomplicated) appendicitis (=AAST Grade 1), respectively. The independent predictive factors of gangrenous appendicitis included a CT value of ≥24 HU, an appendiceal diameter of ≥12 mm, the presence of cecal mucosal edema, and a C-reactive protein level of ≥5.4 mg/dL. The scoring model, based on these four independent predictors, ranged from 0 to 4. The probability values of gangrenous appendicitis were 0%, 15%, and 97% in the low (0)-, moderate (1, 2)-, and high (3, 4)-risk categories, respectively. Our scoring model may assist in decision-making concerning emergency surgery and appendicitis management."

This report presents a unique case of uterine perforation as a result of pyometra in a postmenopausal woman. A 52-year-old postmenopausal woman presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. Clinical suspicion was initially directed toward acute appendicitis. However, imaging revealed pneumoperitoneum with multiple air pockets, suggesting intestinal perforation. Exploratory laparotomy uncovered no bowel perforation but revealed a 2x2 cm uterine fundal perforation with pus drainage. A total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. Histopathology confirmed acute necrotizing inflammation extending into the myometrium, with no malignancy detected. Therefore, early diagnosis and surgical intervention, including hysterectomy, are critical for reducing the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. Hence, this case underscores the importance of considering uterine perforation as a differential diagnosis in elderly postmenopausal women presenting with acute abdomen for which prompt surgical management is essential to ensure a favorable outcome."

    "abstract": "Background: Antibiotics within an hour of incision reduce the incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) in clean-contaminated abdominal surgery. However, patients undergoing emergency surgery for an intra-abdominal infectious process often receive treatment antibiotics and may not benefit from additional pre-incisional antibiotics (POA). We hypothesized that POA would not lead to a reduction in the occurrence of SSIs following emergency appendectomy. Patients and Methods: All patients at a single institution undergoing emergency appendectomies for acute appendicitis from 2013 to 2020 were included. Age, gender, perforation, body mass index (BMI), Elixhauser comorbidity index (ECI), surgical approach, emergency department antibiotics (EDA), EDA administration time, and pre-operative antibiotics were abstracted. Primary outcomes were superficial/deep and organ-space SSIs. Bi-variable logistic regression models assessed the independent impact of each tactic. Multi-variable models compared those receiving pre-incisional cefazolin with those receiving no POA. Results: Patients (n = 1380) had a mean age (standard deviation) of 39.5 (17.0) years, and 48.6% were female. Age, gender, perforated appendicitis, EDA, ECI, and BMI all were predictive of infection. POA were not predictive of SSI (p = 0.632). After adjustment for age, gender, perforation, EDA, EDA administration timing, ECI, and BMI, only perforation (odds ratio [OR]: 17.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.97-51.43) and male gender (OR: 2.75, 95% CI = 1.29-6.43) were associated with organ-space infection, whereas pre-incisional cefazolin was not (OR: 0.83, 95% CI = 0.38-1.97). Emergency department broad-spectrum antibiotics were associated with a lower incidence of superficial/deep infection (OR: 0.06, 95% CI = 0.00-0.68); however, pre-incisional cefazolin was not (OR: 0.71, 95% CI = 0.08-15.34). Conclusion: For patients undergoing emergency appendectomies who have received broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment, additional pre-incisional cefazolin does not reduce the incidence of superficial/deep or organ-space SSI."

Elevated levels of uric acid lead to the formation of monosodium urate crystals and their deposition in joints, and rarely, other parts of the body. The tissues most frequently involved are synovium, bone, cartilage, skin, tendon, ligament, and kidney. Here, we report an unusual presentation of gout manifesting as an abdominal abscess. A 60-year-old man with a history of opioid abuse, hypertension, and knee gouty arthritis presented to the emergency department with severe right knee pain. During hospitalization, he complained of pain in the left lower abdominal quadrant and developed coffee-ground emesis. Computed tomography showed pneumoperitoneum. The patient underwent laparotomy and was found to have gastric perforation and a large abdominal abscess. Drainage of the abscess revealed necrotic and hemorrhagic fragments of omentum. Microscopic examination showed adipose tissue with fat necrosis, acute inflammation, and fungal hyphae. Eosinophilic, amorphous deposits of polarizable needle-shaped crystals were observed in all sections, indicating the presence of monosodium urate crystals. The combined characteristics suggested intra-abdominal gout with concurrent fungal infection resulting from gastric perforation. This presentation is very rare. Only one occurrence of intra-abdominal gout mimicking a pelvic abscess has been reported in the literature."

    "abstract": "The acute abdomen is a life-threatening clinical entity that requires immediate diagnostic evaluation and appropriate treatment. 15-20% of emergency room patients with acute abdominal pain need interventional or surgical treatment. This narrative review is based on publications retrieved by a PubMed search, current textbooks and guidelines, and the authors' personal experience. The acute abdomen presents with the sudden onset of maximally intense abdominal pain, sometimes with guarding, and often with impaired general well-being, ranging to manifestations of shock. Its more common causes, aside from nonspecific abdominal pain (30-41%), are acute appendicitis (8-30%), cholecystitis (9-11%), and ileus (4-5%). The diagnosis is established by the history and physical examination, laboratory tests, imaging studies, and, in some cases, exploratory laparoscopy. The acute abdomen is generally a surgical condition, but it often requires interdisciplinary, multimodal treatment and follow-up. It carries a 2% to 12% mortality, with the figure rising for every elapsed hour until specific treatment is provided. Structured, quality-controlled, rapid, and targeted diagnosis and treatment markedly lower the morbidity and mortality of patients presenting with an acute abdomen."

    "abstract": "The triad of gastric volvulus (GV), wandering spleen (WS), and diaphragmatic eventration (DE) is extremely uncommon and only two cases have been reported in the current pediatric literature. In this paper, we aim to describe the diagnostic and surgical management of a 5-month-old baby with this pathological triad and to present the other cases reported in pediatric literature. A 5-month-old baby was referred to our hospital because of vomiting and inconsolable crying from 12 h. The X-ray study demonstrated a severely distended stomach and a left diaphragmatic elevation. Swallow fluoroscopy revealed no passing contrast in duodenum and abdomen ultrasound showed splenic malposition. Computed tomography scan confirmed GV and WS. The patient underwent an urgent laparoscopy that revealed ischemia of the gastric antrum, thrombosis of the right gastroepiploic vein, and eventration of the left hemidiaphragm. After laparotomic conversion due to hemodynamic instability, derotation of the stomach allowed appreciation of splenic 360° twisting within the diaphragmatic defect. The spleen was untwisted, placed in a fashioned retroperitoneal pocket, and covered with the splenocolic ligament. The stomach was anchored to the large omentum and the diaphragm was plicated. Our case is the first one describing this pathological triad in such a little infant. This association is probably the result of a developmental defect of left upper abdomen ligaments and must be considered a cause of upper gastrointestinal obstruction. In case of diaphragmatic defects, if gastric malposition or ectopic spleen are identified, we suggest early diaphragmatic plication, prophylactic gastropexy, and splenopexy to prevent GV and WS torsion, which can lead to gastric necrosis with perforation and splenic infarction. Although laparoscopy may be useful, operative laparotomy is necessary in case of hemodynamic instability."

    "abstract": "Purpose: Acute appendicitis (AA) is a common surgical emergency affecting 7-8% of the population. Timely diagnosis and treatment are crucial for preventing serious morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis typically involves physical examination, laboratory tests, ultrasonography, and computed tomography (CT). This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in analyzing CT images for the early diagnosis of AA and prevention of complications. Methods: CT images of patients who underwent surgery for AA at the General Surgery Clinic of Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Health Application and Research Center between January 1, 2019, and June 31, 2023, were analyzed. A total of 1200 CT images were evaluated using four different AI models. The model performance was assessed using a confusion matrix. Results: The median age of the patients was 28 years, with a similar sex distribution. No significant differences were observed in terms of age or sex (P = .168 and P = .881, respectively). Among the AI models, MobileNet v2 showed the highest accuracy (0.7908) and precision (0.8203), whereas Inception v3 had the highest F-score (0.7928). In the receiver operating characteristic analysis, MobileNet v2 achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8767. Conclusion: AI's role in daily life is expanding. In the present study, the highest sensitivity and specificity were 77% and 86%, respectively. Supporting CT imaging with AI systems can enhance the accuracy of AA diagnoses."

These tumors often present diagnostic challenges, particularly when their clinical manifestations mimic other abdominal conditions, such as acute appendicitis. CASE REPORT A 75-year-old male patient with a history of multiple comorbidities presented to the Emergency Department with symptoms of chronic pain in the right lower quadrant. Imaging studies, including computed tomography scans, revealed a large heterogeneous density mass measuring 11.3×9.2 cm in the right lower quadrant and a dilated appendix with wall thickening. Subsequent surgical resection with right hemicolectomy and primary anastomosis was performed, and postoperative considerations included adjuvant therapy with imatinib, due to spindle cell morphology and high mitotic activity. Histopathological examination and immunohistochemical staining confirmed the diagnosis, showing positive CD117, DOG1, Bcl-2, D2-40, and WT1 markers. CONCLUSIONS This case report aims to highlight the complexities in diagnosing E-GISTs with atypical presentations and emphasizes the critical role of comprehensive imaging and histopathological assessments in achieving an accurate diagnosis and guiding appropriate management strategies. The successful diagnosis and management highlight the critical role of imaging modalities and immunohistochemical analysis in guiding treatment decisions, while postoperative care, including targeted therapy, is crucial for reducing the risk of recurrence and improving patient outcomes. Future research should focus on optimizing postoperative management strategies and investigating the potential of intraoperative biopsies for tumors abutting adjacent structures."

Coinfection cases are exceedingly uncommon. We aim to document and share this rare case through this case report. We report the case of a 44-year-old woman with no significant past medical history who presented to the emergency department of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou branch, at Taoyuan, Taiwan, in July 2024 with a 3-day history of chest discomfort, shortness of breath and fever. Imaging revealed pericardial and mediastinal fluid with gas. Pericardiocentesis drained the pericardial effusion and later identified Eikenella corrodens and Parvimonas micra via MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. A history of fish bone impaction one month prior suggested an oral origin for the infection, although imaging revealed no esophageal perforation. The patient underwent pericardial drainage, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for abscess drainage, and four weeks of antibiotic treatment with ampicillin-sulbactam, leading to full recovery. To our knowledge, this is likely the first documented case of purulent pericarditis caused by Eikenella corrodens and Parvimonas micra simultaneously.

    "abstract": "Laparoscopic procedures have nowadays become the gold standard in multiple abdominal diseases, but in the emergency setting, especially in major surgery, laparoscopy still represents an obstacle for most surgeons. This multicentric study aims to define the surgical approach for emergency resective surgery in left colonic perforation peritonitis, determine the factors influencing the choice between MIS and open surgery, and identify factors associated with laparotomic conversion. Retrospective data from 516 patients treated for left colonic perforation between January 2019 and December 2023 across six Italian centers was collected. Variables analyzed included patient demographics, disease and surgical characteristics, post-operative complications, and long-term outcomes. Univariate and multivariate regression models were performed to identify factors associated with surgical choice and likelihood of conversion. Only 24.5% of patients underwent laparoscopic approach, with a conversion rate of 52.8%. MIS was associated to lower CCI and MPI and less severe septic status at arrival. MIS was mostly performed by colorectal surgeons, compared to acute care surgeons. The post-operative outcome, considering LOS, ICU admission, post-operative complications and mortality rate, was better in the MIS group. The multivariate regression model revealed that CCI, MPI, and night-time surgery were negatively associated with MIS while colorectal surgeons had a positive association. Laparotomic conversion more commonly occurred in older patients with a higher MPI and CCI and more severe septic status; these patients had a worse post-operative outcome. MPI was the only factor with statistical significance in the univariate analysis, associated with conversion. Although MIS is associated with better post-operative outcomes, it is underutilized in the emergency setting. Patients requiring laparotomic conversion had higher morbidity and mortality compared to those who underwent successful laparoscopy. Limiting factors for MIS include logistic factors, patient severity, and surgical skills, therefore careful patient selection and surgical training is crucial."

    "abstract": "Acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC) is a significant cause of acute abdominal pain, accounting for 90-95% of gallbladder inflammations caused by gallstones. Its clinical presentation ranges from nonspecific abdominal pain to septic conditions associated with an acute abdomen. Timely and accurate diagnosis is critical in patient management, as delayed diagnosis or inadequate treatment can result in increased morbidity and life-threatening complications such as perforation or biliary peritonitis. This study aims to identify factors influencing the severity of ACC by analyzing the relationship between laboratory findings, radiological imaging, and pathology results in cases managed in the emergency department. This retrospective study was conducted at the emergency department of Etlik City Hospital, a tertiary care center. Patients diagnosed with acute cholecystitis were included in the study, while those under 18 years of age and those with choledocholithiasis were excluded. Patients' radiological findings, laboratory parameters, and pathological results were analyzed. A total of 230 patients were included in the study. Patients with pericholecystic fluid exhibited significantly thicker gallbladder walls (p=0.002). A significant association was found between elevated white blood cell (WBC) counts and gallbladder wall thickness (p=0.035). However, no significant relationship was observed between liver function test results and gallbladder wall thickness. This study evaluated the diagnostic and management parameters utilized by clinicians in cases of acute calculous cholecystitis. The association between increased gallbladder wall thickness and pericholecystic fluid was highlighted as a key factor in diagnosis and follow-up. Although laboratory and imaging modalities provide supportive roles in diagnosis, their necessity may vary depending on the individual case. The study emphasizes the importance of a holistic approach that integrates clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings to optimize patient outcomes in the emergency department, avoid unnecessary interventions, and prevent delays in surgical treatment."

    "abstract": "Emergency surgical pathologies constitute a significant portion of general surgery practice. Small bowel obstructions are a common cause of surgical emergencies in general surgical practice. This study aimed to investigate the predictive role of the Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index and Pan-Immune-Inflammation Value in determining the need for operative treatment in adhesive small bowel obstructions. These obstructions are significant in general surgery, yet clinicians lack consensus on treatment selection and clinical follow-up. This study also seeks to address controversial questions surrounding this topic. The study included patients with small bowel obstruction caused by adhesions during the postoperative period who were treated and followed up in our General Surgery Clinic. Patients' age, demographic information, and clinical data from January 2017 to January 2024 were retrospectively reviewed and recorded using the hospital information management system (HIMS) and patient records. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 22.0. A total of 341 patients with postoperative adhesive small bowel obstruction were included in the study. The mean age was 59.6+-17.4 years (range: 18-93 years), with a male-to-female ratio of 1.4: 1. The median duration of symptoms was 2 days (range: 1-30 days). Operative treatment was performed in 19.6% of cases. The most frequently used operative technique was explorative laparotomy and bridectomy (70.1%). Intensive care unit (ICU) admission was required for 16.1% of patients, and the in-hospital mortality rate was 4.1%. The predictive roles of the Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index (SII), Pan-Immune-Inflammation Value (PIV), and other markers for operative treatment were evaluated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that SII (area under the curve [AUC]=0.601, p=0.009) and PIV (AUC=0.596, p=0.010) were determinants for operative treatment. SII and PIV values may assist in determining the need for operative treatment or non-operative follow-up in patients with adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO). By utilizing these markers, unnecessary operative interventions may be avoided. The management strategies for ASBO, a significant component of general surgical emergency practice, remain to be fully clarified. There are ongoing debates in the literature on this subject. We believe further studies with prospective, homogeneous, and broader populations should be conducted to address this issue."

    "abstract": "Omental torsion (OT), caused by twisting of the greater omentum around its axis, leading to reduced blood supply to the distal aspect of the omentum and tissue infarction, is a rare disease that manifests clinically as acute abdominal pain. Accurate preoperative diagnosis is difficult. Here, we present 2 pediatric patients diagnosed and treated using computed tomography (CT). Case 1, a 14-year-old boy, had abdominal pain for 3 days. Upon referral to our hospital due to worsening pain, CT revealed an intra-abdominal fatty mass extending into high-density lesions in the fat tissue. Due to severe peritoneal irritation, emergency single-incision laparoscopic surgery was performed. Secondary OT was diagnosed as the greater omentum was twisted by the cord-like tissue, continuing from the greater omental infarction to the lesser omentum. Partial omentectomy, including the ischemic portion, was performed. Case 2, an 11-year-old boy, was referred with suspected appendicitis due to right lower abdominal pain for 2 days. CT revealed a whirling sign in the greater omentum and high-density lesions in the fat tissue. The patient was in good condition, and the peritoneal irritation was unclear; therefore, conservative treatment was initiated. However, symptoms did not improve after 48 h and single-incision laparoscopic surgery was performed, revealing a twisted necrotic omental mass diagnosed as primary idiopathic greater OT. Partial omentectomy, including the ischemic portion, was performed. CT scan aids in preoperative diagnosis of OT, for which single-incision laparoscopic surgery is a less invasive and useful therapy. Early surgical intervention is warranted when conservative treatment fails."

    "abstract": "A 73-year-old woman developed abdominal distention, pain with pallor, and hypotension after successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention with 1 drug-eluting stent. Emergent blood tests and abdominal imaging confirmed right perirenal hemorrhage. Selective renal angiogram revealed ongoing bleeding from a distal renal artery perforation when her clinical condition deteriorated despite conservative management. A vascular plug device was deployed in a renal branch supplying the bleeding area, because direct access to the perforated distal vessel was not feasible, and successfully stopped the fatal bleeding. This case provides insights into managing iatrogenic renal artery perforations, which is important as renal artery-related interventions become more widespread."

    "title": "Factors associated with delayed bleeding following ampullectomy: A retrospective cohort study.",
    "abstract": "Endoscopic ampullectomy is the preferred treatment for selected periampullary lesions, yet up to 10.6% of patients may experience delayed bleeding post-procedure. This study aims to identify predictors for bleeding, which remain poorly understood. This was a single-center retrospective cohort study of adult patients who underwent endoscopic ampullectomy (EA) between January 2011 and September 2023. The primary outcome was the risk factors for delayed bleeding, defined as post-procedural bleeding that necessitated either an emergency department visit, hospital admission, blood transfusion, or re-intervention. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, such as perforation and pancreatitis. A total of 113 patients underwent EA, and 25 (22.1%) experienced delayed bleeding. Of these, 20 (80%) required repeat endoscopy, six (24%) needed blood transfusions, and three (12%) were managed conservatively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified international normalized ratio ≥1.2 (odds ratio [OR] 3.32, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.03-10.74, p = 0.05), presence of high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal cancer (OR 3.76, 95% CI 1.20-11.81, p = 0.03), female sex (OR 3.14, 95% CI 1.11-8.93, p = 0.03), size of lesion (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.08, p = 0.03) and procedure duration (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-0.99, p = 0.04) as independent predictors of delayed bleeding. Several factors, including features of high-grade dysplasia-intramucosal cancer, international normalized ratio ≥1.2, female sex, lesion size, and procedure duration are associated with delayed post-ampullectomy bleeding. These factors should be taken into consideration when strategizing the reduction of post-ampullectomy bleeding."

    "abstract": "There are a couple of references in literature reporting the incidence of acute appendicitis during pregnancy, and the incidence rate is 0.4-1.4 per 1000 pregnancies. Acute appendicitis and perforated acute appendicitis in the postpartum period are rare incidences. Fever and abdominal pain are very common symptoms in acute appendicitis. Here, we are presenting a case of postpartum acute perforated appendicitis. A 34-year-old female was admitted in the department of obstetrics and gynecology with abdominal pain and severe abdominal tenderness. The cervical os was dilated, so the patient was taken to the labor room where she delivered a very low birth weight baby at 22 weeks. After delivery, patient developed respiratory distress and there was a sudden deterioration in her condition. She was then shifted to the critical care unit. The case was managed and the patient's respiratory distress lessened but the abdominal pain and tenderness still persisted. Plain radiography was done and it showed \"gas under diaphragm.\" The CT scan also showed pneumoperitoneum and a decision was taken to perform an emergency laparotomy. On laparotomy, perforated appendicitis was found. Diagnosis of acute abdomen in pregnancy and the early postpartum period is very confusing, but an early diagnosis is always important. In antenatal screening, an ultrasound of the whole abdomen should be mandated in 30+ years old pregnant women. Surgery is the recommended treatment in such cases."

Their use, however, is associated with a wide range of gastrointestinal adverse effects like nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort. This case report presents a 59-year-old woman with a previous Roux-en-Y gastric bypass who was prescribed semaglutide, and subsequently developed intussusception with small bowel obstruction and chemical pancreatitis. The patient presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain. The patient's laboratory and radiographic studies revealed a long segment of small bowel intussusception, resulting in a small bowel obstruction and likely chemical pancreatitis. Laparoscopic surgical intervention was required, ultimately converted to a laparotomy for successful reduction of the intussusception. This case report underscores a potential complication that may be seen in patients prescribed GLP-1RAs with prior gastric Roux-en-Y surgeries. The adverse effect is likely attributable to altered gastrointestinal motility and delayed gastric emptying, mechanisms that may be exacerbated by the combination of bariatric-induced anatomical changes and the pharmacological actions of GLP-1RAs. Given the increasing prevalence of GLP-1RA use, emergency medicine clinicians must remain vigilant for these potential serious adverse effects, particularly in patients with complex gastrointestinal histories to ensure timely diagnosis and intervention."

Here, we elucidated the usefulness of endoscopic intervention for patients with delayed perforation. Patients who underwent gastric ESD from 2005 to 2022 were assessed for eligibility. Delayed perforation was defined as no intraprocedural perforation after the ESD but subsequent development of peritoneal irritation and free air on computed tomography scan. Participants were divided into early- and late-period groups based on time (October 2015) of implementation of the polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheet and the over-the-scope clip (OTSC) in clinical practice. We evaluated changes in incidence of required surgery. Among the 5,048 patients who underwent gastric ESD, delayed perforation occurred in 28 patients (0.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.4%-0.8%). Incidence of delayed perforation did not differ significantly between the early- and late-period groups (0.5% vs. 0.6%). The proportion of patients who underwent surgery was significantly smaller in the late-period group than in the early-period group (54% vs. 13%, odds ratio [OR] 0.14, 95% CI 0.02-0.83; P = 0.042); this was confirmed by multivariate analysis (adjusted OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.002-0.9; P = 0.043) after adjustment for age, sex, Charlson's comorbidity index, tumor location, and size. Endoscopic intervention using PGA sheets and OTSC was associated with a low incidence of required surgery for delayed perforation after gastric ESD and is recommended."

However, in rare cases, fish bones can perforate the gastrointestinal tract, causing serious complications such as perforation, abscess formation, or fistula development, necessitating emergent surgical intervention. This case report describes a rare case of gastric perforation by a fish bone ingestion, complicated by perigastric and hepatic abscesses. The patient initially presented to a rural emergency department with acute abdominal pain, where limited imaging resources posed a diagnostic challenge. After repeated rural emergency department presentations, a definitive diagnosis was only established after the patient was transferred to a tertiary center and evaluated using computed tomography (CT) imaging. This helped to guide appropriate surgical management, and an emergency laparotomy was performed, which was followed by an uneventful recovery. We emphasize the critical role of CT imaging in diagnosing fish bone perforation, discuss common sites of perforation, and highlight the need to consider this pathology as a differential diagnosis in patients with undifferentiated abdominal pain."

    "abstract": "The risk of evisceration, the need for rapid treatment, and the possibility of recurrent dehiscence make burst abdomen a severe postoperative complication that surgeons must deal with. A wound's dehiscence is linked to severe morbidity and mortality. This study examined how rapidly abdominal burst and wound dehiscence could be identified in patients after both emergency and scheduled laparotomies. This prospective study included 80 patients with burst abdomens, aged more than 18, who underwent exploratory laparotomies in the Department of General Surgery, LLR, and associated hospitals, Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial (GSVM) Medical College from January 2021 to October 2022. Various factors were observed, such as postoperative wound infection, nutritional status, raised intra-abdominal pressure, type of pathology, and patients undergoing emergency or elective exploratory laparotomy. The presence of intra-abdominal sepsis (63.75%), anemia (61.25%), and hypoproteinemia (50%) favors a higher incidence of burst abdomen as preoperative risk factors. Among various pathologies, gastro-duodenal perforation (30.0%) was found to be the most common pathology associated with a burst abdomen. In the postoperative period, wound infection (77.5.0%) was the most common factor associated with a burst abdomen, followed by raised intra-abdominal pressure (due to cough (35%), vomiting (17.5%)), and postoperative abdominal distension (27.5%). Intra-abdominal pressure was found to be a very sensitive early predictor of wound dehiscence, with peak incidence on POD-6 (IAP>16 mmHg). Emergency procedures are more likely than elective surgeries to result in a burst abdomen. Anemia and wound infection both raise the risk of abdominal rupture. Intra-abdominal pressure was found to be a very sensitive early predictor of wound dehiscence. In both the treatment and prevention of this disorder, adherence to good methods and serious attempts to reduce the influence of predisposing variables are much more important."

    "abstract": "Necrotizing pancreatitis (NP) is a serious complication of acute pancreatitis. In this case report, we report a complex scenario in which a patient initially admitted for perforated appendicitis developed necrotizing pancreatitis during the hospital stay. Necrotizing pancreatitis is a rare clinical outcome, and by examining potential factors that contributed to this patient's condition, we offer insights into how to assess and potentially prevent future cases of necrotizing pancreatitis in similar patients. An 83-year-old male with a complex past medical history, including coronary artery disease with 12 cardiac stents, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a prior pulmonary embolism, presented to the emergency department with acute-onset right lower quadrant abdominal pain, fever, and nausea. He was diagnosed with acute appendicitis with micro-perforations and underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy and lysis of adhesions. Postoperatively, the patient developed hypotension and tachycardia, requiring vasopressor support, as well as hematemesis and sepsis. A CT scan revealed a partially necrotic pancreas, prompting an exploratory laparotomy and pancreatic debridement. Blood cultures identified Candida glabrata, leading to the initiation of antifungal therapy. Despite aggressive critical care, including multiple abdominal surgeries, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and antifungal treatment, the patient developed multiorgan failure. On day 16, after going into cardiac arrest, the patient was pronounced deceased.  This case highlights the importance of early diagnostic strategies for high-risk patients with possible overlapping symptoms in the setting of acute abdominal pain. A broader scope of clinical assessments with timely intervention and aggressive management may be crucial in preventing severe outcomes, such as necrotizing pancreatitis."

Herein, we reported an extremely rare case of intracardiac bone cement embolism after percutaneous kyphoplasty causing right ventricle perforation. A 70-year-old woman, experiencing sudden left chest pain with radiation to the shoulder for 9 h, was transferred to our emergency department. Two hours before onset of her symptoms, she underwent percutaneous kyphoplasty at the local hospital. The computed tomography angiography revealed that an intracardiac foreign body penetrated her right ventricle. In light of her surgical history, bone cement embolism was suspected and thus, the patient was transferred to our center. Computed tomography and echocardiography confirmed the presence of intracardiac linear-shaped foreign body perforating the right ventricle. Therefore, the patient underwent open-heart surgery and the bone cement was removed successfully. Symptomatic intracardiac bone cement embolism is potentially fatal, so the rapid diagnosis and prompt treatment measures based on the cement emboli characteristics and the patient's condition are crucial."

Herniation of the small intestine into the mesosigmoid fossa is an extraordinary situation. A possible diagnostic delay may lead to intestinal ischemia, perforation, or even necrosis. CASE REPORT A 47-year-old woman was admitted in our Emergency Department with a 24-hour colic pain that started at the epigastrium and then moved to the left pelvic region. Small-bowel obstruction due to internal herniation was diagnosed based on clinical, radiological, and laboratory examination results. We encountered a loop of jejunum that was herniated into the mesosigmoid fossa, making this a unique case, as in most such cases the internal herniated loops are loops of ileum. CONCLUSIONS The key role of computed tomography (CT) is highlighted and the characteristic sign of \"C-shaped cluster\" is mentioned in the literature for intersigmoid hernia. Although internal mesosigmoid hernia is rare, it should be always kept in mind when the patient's digestive tract is affected. Our main purpose here is to highlight this rare entity for our fellow surgeons."

    "abstract": "The placement of a chest drain is one of the most common surgical procedures in the hospital setting. It is performed by a large number of physicians of different specialties. Some techniques have made chest drainage more accessible through their speed and simplicity, such as the Seldinger technique. Nevertheless, it is an act that can, like any surgical technique, be the cause of significant morbidity and even mortality. We report the case of a patient who was treated with a thoracic drain using the Seldinger technique for a traumatic pneumothorax secondary to rib fractures. This procedure was complicated by a left ventricular perforation requiring urgent surgical management. We wish to highlight the risk associated with certain techniques described as minimally invasive, as is the case with the Seldinger technique, and to remind that this is not an innocuous procedure that may lead to serious complications. For this reason, it is necessary that the placement of a chest drain be performed by someone experienced, familiar with the equipment, after having read the clinical and radiological information concerning the patient and in compliance with the available guidelines. La mise en place d’un drain thoracique est l’un des gestes chirurgicaux les plus répandus en milieu hospitalier. Il est exécuté par un grand nombre de médecins de spécialités différentes.

Pourtant, il s’agit d’un acte qui peut, tout comme la technique chirurgicale, être à l’origine d’une morbidité, voire d’une mortalité, non négligeable. Nous rapportons le cas d’un patient qui a bénéficié de la pose d’un drain thoracique selon la technique de Seldinger pour un pneumothorax traumatique secondaire à des fractures costales. Cette procédure s’est compliquée d’une perforation ventriculaire gauche nécessitant une prise en charge chirurgicale urgente. Nous souhaitons, mettre en exergue le risque associé à certaines techniques décrites comme mini-invasives, comme c’est le cas de la technique de Seldinger, et rappeler qu’il ne s’agit pas d’un acte anodin et qu’il peut mener à des complications parfois graves. C’est pourquoi, il est nécessaire que la mise en place d’un drain thoracique soit réalisée par quelqu’un d’expérimenté, familiarisé avec le matériel, après avoir pris connaissance des informations cliniques et radiologiques relatives au patient et dans le respect des recommandations disponibles."

Based on clinical examination, transvaginal ultrasound, and computed tomography findings, an incorrect diagnosis of pyosalpinx was made, and intravenous treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics was initiated. However, the lack of improvement in the patient's clinical and laboratory findings after two days led to the decision to perform a laparotomy. Intraoperatively, a periappendiceal abscess was found, with a bilateral secondary extension of inflammation to the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and pelvic peritoneum. The inflamed appendix was resected from its retrocecal position, and the pelvic abscess was drained. The postoperative course was uneventful. This case report highlights an atypical presentation of acute appendicitis with abscess, which was preoperatively misdiagnosed as pyosalpinx. The main factors contributing to the misdiagnosis of acute appendicitis and the subsequent delay in medical care are discussed, emphasizing that early and accurate diagnosis is crucial in preventing adverse outcomes and ensuring effective treatment."

She was prescribed laxatives; however, there was no improvement and she presented to our emergency department for vomiting. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen showed irregular wall thickening of the rectal Rs with contrast enhancement and dilation of the mouth side of the intestine. Multiple large lymph nodes were also observed near the lesion, around the inferior mesenteric artery, and in the para-aortic region. This suggests multiple lymph node metastases from rectal cancer. In addition, a calcified nodule was observed on the dorsal surface of the uterus, along with an ascites effusion, leading to the suspicion of a disseminated nodule. The patient underwent urgent colonic stenting for bowel obstruction due to rectal cancer. Although the patient was being considered standby for rectal cancer resection followed by chemotherapy, preoperative chest CT showed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the left axilla, left pectoral interstitium, subpectoralis minor, and left supraclavicular fossa, as well as a mass lesion in the left mammary CD region, leading to the suspicion of breast cancer with lymph node metastasis. Fine-needle aspiration cytology of the axillary lymph nodes was consistent with a Class Ⅴ breast cancer origin, but core needle biopsy of the mass lesion in the left mammary gland showed no evidence of malignancy. Therefore, axillary lymph node metastasis was considered to originate from negative breast cancer or unknown primary or rectal cancer. Laparoscopic low anterior resection, D2 dissection, and biopsy of the left axillary lymph node were performed for rectal cancer obstruction and Stage Ⅳ. Pathological results showed that the morphology of the adenocarcinoma in the left axillary lymph node was similar to that of the colorectal cancer lesion, and immunostaining results were consistent with lymph node metastasis in colorectal cancer. Based on the above, a diagnosis of rectal cancer Rs with left axillary lymph node metastasis(pStage Ⅳ)was made, and postoperative chemotherapy was started from the 5th week. Chemotherapy is currently ongoing 6 months after surgery."

    "abstract": "Tension pneumoperitoneum (TPP) is a rare but life-threatening pathology in which significant accumulation of free air in the peritoneum pressurizes the abdominal cavity, creating conditions similar to abdominal compartment syndrome. Due to compression of intra-abdominal vasculature, TPP results in hemodynamic instability. While it most commonly occurs due to viscus perforation in the setting of recent endoscopy, gastric perforation from resuscitative efforts can also lead to TPP. We present a case of a 58-year-old female who was intubated out-of-hospital for unresponsiveness, then subsequently developed abdominal distension, mottled lower extremities, and hemodynamic instability. In the emergency department, the patient self-extubated for a brief time before suffering cardiac arrest. During resuscitative efforts, imaging showed significant abdominal free air concerning for tension pneumoperitoneum. The likely etiology was positive pressure ventilation after esophageal intubation, resulting in gastric perforation and rapid accumulation of air in the peritoneal cavity. Despite emergent abdominal needle decompression and prompt exploratory surgery, the patient expired. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: TPP is a critical pathology that should be on the differential for any patient with recent unverified intubation presenting with hemodynamic instability and abdominal distension. Abdominal needle decompression is a key intervention for the patient with TPP and should be in the emergency physician's skillset.

Upon admission, hypoxia developed with a PaO2 of 66.7 mmHg under oxygen therapy. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed a perforated peptic ulcer with free gas and ascites. Emergency laparoscopic surgery was performed safely using a customized port position. Patients with scoliosis are prone to respiratory dysfunction, increasing their risk of life-threatening complications from peptic ulcer perforation. Early treatment is crucial in such cases.

Port insertion from the lower abdomen helped overcome anatomical limitations. Emergency laparoscopic surgery can be a viable option for patients with severe scoliosis and perforated peptic ulcers. Prompt decision-making, seamless perioperative management with the anesthesiologist, and tailored port placement to avoid intra-abdominal interference are essential for safe and effective procedures."

    "abstract": "Cecal volvulus, a rare cause of postoperative bowel obstruction, involves the twisting of the cecum and its mesentery, leading to the risk of ischemia. We present a case of cecal volvulus following open right hepatectomy in a patient in her 70s with no prior abdominal surgeries. On postoperative day six, after developing abdominal distension and pain, a CT scan revealed bowel obstruction and a cecal volvulus was suspected. Emergency laparotomy confirmed cecal volvulus with a highly mobile cecum, necessitating right hemicolectomy with end-ileostomy due to sepsis. The patient's recovery was prolonged due to complications, including postoperative paralysis and fascial dehiscence. To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of cecal volvulus following right hepatectomy, likely due to altered anatomy and postoperative paralysis. This case underscores the importance of considering cecal volvulus in postoperative obstruction cases, especially following surgeries affecting right-sided visceral structures."

    "abstract": "Background: Given the expansiveness of diagnostic and therapeutic hysteroscopy, promptly recognizing complications and intervening as necessary to prevent adverse outcomes and minimize legal risk is imperative. We aim to describe the litigious trends in hysteroscopic procedures across the United States; Methods: Publicly available lawsuits published on a well-known legal database, Westlaw, were reviewed. The search term \"'hysteroscop!'\" was used to filter cases for court opinions containing words with this prefix, including \"hysteroscopy\", \"hysteroscopies\", and \"hysteroscopic.\" Adverse events, procedural outcomes, post-procedural surgery urgency, and resultant disabilities were extracted for themes; Results: The primary complication resulting in legal action was uterine perforation (52.9%), followed by claimed technical mistakes (23.5%) and damage to surrounding structures (11.8%). The most common outcome was the need for future corrective surgery (70.6%), and a number of cases resulted in permanent brain damage or death (23.6%). Of the patients that required subsequent corrective surgery (n = 12), 91.7% of them required emergent surgery. Patients sought damages most commonly from individual attending providers (41.2%), attending physician and practice groups/hospitals collectively (41.2%), and additional entities, including resident physicians in training and manufacturers. Awards ranged from $322,308 to $9,387,109; Conclusions: Medical malpractice litigation is challenging to patients and providers alike, often leading to financial, emotional, and professional burden. Our evaluation highlights the variability in adverse events from hysteroscopy which prompt litigation, financial burden of lawsuits, and legal risk of individual providers, in an attempt to improve safety of future procedures."

    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Isolated cecum necrosis (ICN) is a rare disease and there are few reports on it in the literature. We retrospectively analyzed the patients with acute abdomen who had ICN, in terms of etiology, demographic findings, surgery, and prognosis to determine the best treatment approach. Methods: Seven patients with per-operative diagnosis of isolated cecal necrosis were included in the study. Age, gender, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory data, imaging modalities, time from symptoms to surgery, surgical procedure, hospital stay, morbidity, and mortality were retrospectively analyzed. Results: The median age of the patients and the F/M ratio were 61 years and 2/5, respectively. The most common comorbidity was chronic renal failure, followed by hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. The median time from symptom onset to surgery was 1 day. The ileocolic anastomosis was performed in 4 patients and terminal ileostomy in three patients. The morbidity and mortality rates were 28.5% and 14.3%, respectively. The median length of hospital stay was 12 days. Conclusions: ICN should be suspected in elderly patients with comorbidities presenting to the emergency department with an acute abdomen. Computed tomography is an important diagnostic tool. Diagnostic laparoscopy is a good option for definitive diagnosis and end ileostomy is better than anastomosis in patients with bleeding tendency or hypotensive patients with chronic renal failure on dialysis, coronary artery disease, and in the presence of purulent peritonitis to reduce morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "Appendiceal intussusception is a rare condition characterized by the invagination of the appendix into the base of the cecum. In some cases, this condition can lead to obstruction, ischemia, and perforation. It is more common in elderly patients, particularly women, and is often associated with the presence of a lesion, benign or malignant, acting as a \"lead point.\" This case report details the emergency management of a 54-year-old female patient with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The physical examination was unremarkable, as were the laboratory tests. However, ultrasound revealed a small amount of fluid in the pelvis, leading to further investigation with a CT scan which showed appendiceal intussusception with significant wall edema, fluid in the surrounding fatty tissue, and reactive lymph nodes. The patient then underwent an operation that confirmed an intussuscepted appendix showing signs of ischemia. Histopathology showed the presence of an endometrioma acting as the \"lead point\". This case report showcases the crucial role of diagnostic imaging, which is superior to clinical examination and laboratory tests when diagnosing these patients. Diagnostic imaging, coupled with careful differential diagnosis, is vital to distinguishing benign conditions from malignancy and ensuring timely and appropriate intervention. Early diagnosis and surgical intervention are essential to prevent life-threatening complications such as gangrene and perforation and exclude malignancy in adult patients."

    "abstract": "It is not uncommon for a child to present to the hospital due to accidental ingestions, and oftentimes they are the result of a child accessing household cleaning or home improvement products. Typically, the upper gastrointestinal tract is the site of initial tissue insult and prognosis of these cases depends on a variety of factors, including the ingested substance, injury extent, and assessments and treatments rendered. Possible post-ingestion complications that make management difficult may include mediastinitis, hemodynamic instability, gastrointestinal perforation, erosion and scarring. In this case, a 13-month-old boy accidently swallowed Trisodium phosphate [Na3PO4] (TSP), a common household all-purpose heavy-duty cleaner. After ingestion, the patient presented to the emergency department where a multi-disciplinary team-initiated care. Work-up included regular vital checks, electrolyte profiles, blood profiles and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy. He was eventually discharged and scheduled to return for follow-up with esophagram, without long term consequences. Although the ingestion of TSP has occurred before, the literature regarding consumption of this specific detergent is negligible. This case provides evidence regarding the treatment and outcome of a paediatric patient who accidentally swallowed TSP and offers guidance in the management of their care."

    "abstract": "Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) is a rare radiographic finding that can range from being a benign process to needing emergency surgery. Sufficiently powered studies are lacking, and recommendations for management remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to identify key predictors of pathologic PI using physical examination, laboratory, and radiographic findings. A retrospective cohort study was conducted at two quaternary academic centers (2010-2020). A total of 334 consecutive patients 18 years or older with radiographic evidence of PI were identified. Patients were excluded if they pursued comfort care or if there was concurrent radiographic evidence of vaso-occlusive process. Pathologic PI was defined as presence of ischemic and/or perforated bowel on exploratory laparotomy or death prior to planned surgery. Of the 334 patients included in our study, 91 (27%) underwent exploratory laparotomy, of which 59 (65%) had ischemic and/or perforated bowel. These latter patients and 10 other patients who died before exploratory laparotomy defined the pathologic PI cohort. A stepwise model was created for predicting pathologic disease. Significant predictors were the presence of portal venous gas, multisegment PI, vasopressor use, peritonitis, increasing leukocyte count, and end organ injury, which were used to construct a nomogram for clinical use. A nomogram score based on presence of portal venous gas, multisegment PI, vasopressor use, peritonitis, leukocytosis, and end organ injury may help predict the probability of pathologic PI and therefore can inform surgical decision making.

    "abstract": "The rising threat of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) infections highlights the urgent need for effective antimicrobial agents and therapies. Peptide-based antimicrobial nanomaterials are well-placed to meet this need. Here, we explore the conjugation of antimicrobial gemini quaternary ammonium compounds (GQAs) with designed short hexapeptides to create cationic antimicrobial nanomaterials with low cytotoxicity and minimal resistance tendency. (WA)3GQA8C self-assembles into nanoparticles and exhibits potent antimicrobial activity against drug-resistant pathogens and enhanced stability. (WA)3GQA8C protects against subcutaneous abscess infection and rescues mice from acute peritonitis infection by reducing the systemic bacterial burden and alleviating organ damage, with superior effects to vancomycin. Notably, (WA)3GQA8C thoroughly disrupts bacterial membrane integrity akin to peeling fruit to induce bacterial membrane disintegration, a feat inaccessible to conventional antibiotics. Mechanistic studies suggest that (WA)3GQA8C targets the bacterial membrane phospholipids phosphatidylglycerol (PG), inducing PG deformation to form fibrous or lamellar structures, which leads to the disruption of the bacterial membrane. Furthermore, the interference in lipoprotein trafficking exacerbates damage to bacterial membrane integrity. (WA)3GQA8C also synergizes antimicrobial activity by impairing the protein synthesis function of the ribosome. These quaternized peptide nanoassemblies provide a rational strategy for designing peptide-based antimicrobial nanomaterials to combat the growing threats of resistant bacteria."

This report introduces a novel surgical approach for repairing a complex combined bile duct and duodenal perforation. A 37-year-old male with recurrent pyloric stenosis and choledocholithiasis, previously treated with multiple procedures, presented with gastric outlet and bile duct obstruction. Following a complex ERCP, he developed a large combined duodenal and bile duct perforation requiring urgent surgical intervention. A 40% circumferential duodenal perforation combined with bile duct perforation was repaired using a novel approach: a vascularized isolated distal gastric pouch was created and anastomosed to the duodenal and bile duct defects. A Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy was performed, and the patient recovered in stable condition. When traditional reconstruction is not feasible for DP, an isolated, vascularized distal gastric pouch offers a less invasive alternative and reduces the risk of morbidity."

    "abstract": "Adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is a common emergency that requires prompt medical attention, and the timing of surgical intervention poses a considerable challenge. Although computed tomography (CT) is widely used, its effectiveness in accurately identifying bowel strangulation is limited. The potential of radiomics models to predict the necessity for surgical resection in ASBO cases is not yet fully explored. The aim of this study is to identify risk factors for surgical resection in patients with ASBO and to develop a predictive model that integrates radiomic features with clinical data. This model designed to estimate the likelihood of surgical intervention and aid in clinical decision-making for acute ASBO cases. From January 2019 to February 2022, we enrolled 188 ASBO patients from our hospital, dividing them randomly into a training cohort (n = 131) and a test cohort (n = 57) using a 7:3 ratio. We collected baseline clinical data and extracted radiomic features from CT images to compute a radiomic score (Rad-score). A nomogram was developed that combines clinical characteristics and Rad-score. The performance of clinical, radiomic, and combined nomogram models was evaluated in both cohorts. Of the 188 patients, 92 underwent surgical resection, while 96 did not. The nomogram integrated factors such as white blood cell count, duration of obstruction, and preoperative infection indicators (fever, tachycardia, peritonitis), along with CT findings (elevated wall density, thickened wall, mesenteric fluid, ascites, bowel wall gas, small bowel feces, and hyperdensity of mesenteric fat) (p < 0.1). This combined model accurately predicted the need for surgical resection, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.761 (95% CI, 0.628-0.893) for the test cohort. Calibration curves showed strong agreement between predicted and observed outcomes, and decision curve analysis validated the model's utility for acute ASBO cases. We developed and validated a CT-based nomogram that combines radiomic features with clinical data to predict the risk of surgical resection in ASBO patients. This tool offers valuable support for treatment planning and decision-making in emergent situations."

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between secondary generalized peritonitis and short-term mortality and postoperative complications in patients undergoing major abdominal emergency surgery. The study included patients with the age ≥ 18 years undergoing major emergency abdominal surgery in a University Hospital from 2017 to 2019 after the introduction of a perioperative bundle care program. The primary outcome measures were short-term mortality, defined as death within 30 and 90 days after surgery and postoperative complications within 30 days after surgery. Uni- and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate risk factors for 30- and 90-days mortality and 30-days postoperative complications. A total of 591 patients were included, of whom 21% (124/591) had generalized peritonitis. The overall 30 day-mortality rate was 12.5% (74/591). Patients with generalized peritonitis had a significantly higher 30-day mortality rate than patients with non-generalized peritonitis 18.5% (23/124) vs. 10.9% (51/467), P = 0.033. Generalized peritonitis was an independent risk factor for 30- and 90- days mortality. There was a significantly higher rate of admission to ICU for patients with generalized peritonitis 39.5% (49/124) vs. 12.6% (59/467), P < 0.001. Patients with generalized peritonitis had significantly higher rates of surgical and non-surgical complication compared to patients with non-generalized peritonitis 87.1% (108/124) vs. 65.7% (307/467), P < 0.001. Generalized peritonitis was an independent risk factor of 30 days postoperative complications. In a population undergoing major emergency abdominal surgery treated in a perioperative optimization protocol, generalized peritonitis was an independent risk factor for both 30- and 90-days mortality and postoperative complications."

Direct peritoneal resuscitation (DPR), whereby the open abdomen is continuously irrigated with glucose-based hypertonic dialysate, is a valuable adjunct that improves abdominal closure rates and decreases wound complications. Infectious implications of its use remain underexplored. Objective: To assess the impact of DPR on the incidence intra-abdominal fungal infections (AFIs) in critically ill surgical patients. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed of trauma and emergency general surgery patients undergoing DCL with and without DPR at our level 1 trauma center. The effect of DPR on the primary outcomes was assessed using two-stage logistic regression models. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) models were used to evaluate the leading factors contributing to the primary outcome. Results: A total of 169 patients were included in the study, 44% of which underwent DPR. Overall, patients who underwent DPR received a more frequent diagnosis of AFIs (28% vs. 13%, p = 0.012). After multi-variable adjustment, patients undergoing post-operative DPR had significantly higher odds of developing AFI (odds ratio [OR] = 5.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3-18.5). In hybrid-logit CART models, DPR was again identified as being associated with an increased likelihood of developing AFI (OR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.0-6.0). Conclusion: In this cohort, DPR patients had significantly higher chances of developing AFIs. This supports the need for further investigation into the clinical implications of AFIs in critically ill surgical patients and the need to develop risk mitigating strategies."

After resuscitation, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed a Forest IIB duodenal bulb ulcer. Bleeding could not be controlled locally, necessitating laparotomy, at which time, anterior and posterior perforated duodenal ulcers sealed against the liver and pancreas were found, with active bleeding of the posterior ulcer. The bleeding vessel was over-sewn, followed by an antrectomy and Billroth II gastrojejunostomy. The patient was discharged on the eighth postoperative day and was followed up two weeks later with a satisfactory outcome. Kissing duodenal ulcers may present in young adults with a history of NSAIDS and steroid use. Perforation may not always be apparent especially if sealed. Urgent EGD does not decrease mortality.

A retrospective study was conducted on 90 patients diagnosed with periappendiceal abscesses at Harbin Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine between March 2022 and December 2023. The study compared clinical outcomes between two groups: one receiving percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) with antibiotic therapy and the other undergoing emergency laparoscopic surgery. The comparison encompassed key outcomes such as operative time, gastrointestinal function recovery, length of hospital stays, postoperative complication rate, recurrence rate, and the need for additional interventions. The PCD group exhibited a significantly shorter operative time (P=0.02) and fewer postoperative complications (P=0.008) compared to the ELS group. During outpatient follow-up, six patients in the PCD group had a recurrence of appendicitis, which was statistically significant compared to the ELS group. Ultrasound-guided PCD has been shown to be effective and safe in the management of periappendiceal abscesses in our single-center clinical study. It offers several benefits over ELS, such as reduced operative time and a decreased incidence of postoperative complications. Our results suggest that PCD, in conjunction with antibiotic therapy, is a feasible alternative to surgery, significantly reducing patient discomfort and healthcare resource consumption. However, these findings are specific to our center, and further multicenter studies are required to confirm these results and to establish guidelines for the optimal application of PCD in clinical practice."

A 25-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department with a three-day history of right-sided abdominal pain associated with nausea and two episodes of non-bilious vomiting. Physical examination was initially benign but later showed tenderness to the right of the umbilicus. A CT scan revealed an inflamed appendix. Based on clinical and radiological findings, the diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made. The patient underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy. Histopathological analysis of the appendix was performed, identifying an appendiceal neuroendocrine tumor (aNET). Following the initial diagnosis, an appropriate workup was conducted, which included a colonoscopy, computed tomography (CT) scan, and further biopsies. Histopathological analysis of the appendix revealed a well-differentiated grade 1 NET, measuring 3.5 cm, with invasion into peri-appendiceal tissues. Further evaluation through a repeat CT scan and colonoscopy revealed inflammation in the rectum, cecum, and right colon. Furthermore, a subsequent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy was performed. Pathology of the hemicolectomy specimen revealed no residual NET, though lymph node involvement was present, with three out of 18 nodes testing positive for lymphatic spread. This case report highlights the diagnostic and management challenges associated with aNETs, emphasizing the importance of surgical intervention in the context of acute appendicitis. The discovery of aNETs can significantly alter the clinical management course, as it did for this patient, who required further surgical intervention and ongoing surveillance.

The ileosigmoid knotting was clearly visible on the computed tomography. Emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed, and a viable ileosigmoid knot was identified. Unknotting, derotation, and decompression of the sigmoid colon were performed. The postoperative course was uneventful. Ileosigmoid knotting is a rare, life-threatening cause of intestinal obstruction with rapid progression to intestinal vascular compromise and gangrene. It is a hyperactive segment of ileum that winds around the pedicle of the redundant sigmoid colon, resulting in a closed-loop obstruction. There are different classification schemes of ileosigmoid knotting depending on the active component of the knot and based on the viability of the bowel and physiology of the patient. Preoperative diagnosis of this condition is often challenging and usually confirmed intraoperative. A high index of suspicion and prompt surgical exploration are crucial for the best outcome of the patient. Despite being a rare cause of intestinal obstruction, ileosigmoid knotting poses a significant morbidity and mortality to the patient. Management of a patient with viable ileosigmoid knotting is controversial, as some scholars suggest non-resective options and others recommend resective treatment as a recurrence preventive measure."

    "title": "Recurrence Following Operative vs. Non-Operative Management of Adhesive Small Bowel Obstruction in Children: A Multi-center Prospective Observational Study.",
    "abstract": "Data on the incidence of recurrent adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) following index admission for ASBO in children are limited. We sought to determine if operative management was associated with a lower rate of recurrence compared to non-operative management (NOM). We conducted a prospective observational study of children with ASBO admitted to nine hospitals from 10/2020 to 12/2022 who underwent a trial of NOM. Children were followed for a year after admission. The primary outcome was readmission for recurrent ASBO. Adjusted comparisons were made between children successfully managed nonoperatively at the index admission and those who underwent surgery. Among 136 children, 87 (63.9%) had successful NOM at the index admission. Within 1 year, twenty patients (14.7%; 17/87 NOM group; 3/49 operative group) had recurrent ASBO. On unadjusted analysis, there was a higher risk of recurrent ASBO in the NOM group (19.5 vs. 6.1%, P=0.04). However, after adjusting for age (HR 0.35, CI 0.10-1.23), there was no significant difference. Among patients with recurrent ASBO, 7/20 (35%) underwent an urgent or emergent operation at readmission; this rate was similar between initial management groups. Although the rate of recurrent ASBO in children is nearly 15% within one year, this rate does not differ based on the initial management strategy. Among children with recurrent ASBO, one-third underwent an urgent or emergent operation at readmission. NOM appears to be as effective in preventing recurrent ASBO as surgery."

    "abstract": "Mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma (MAA) is a rare malignancy that can occasionally present with complications such as rupture and local invasion. This report details a unique case of MAA rupturing into the sigmoid colon and the subsequent management of the patient. A 62-year-old male presented with hypogastric abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, and a palpable abdominal mass. A CT scan revealed an 8 cm intraperitoneal collection in contact with both the appendix and the sigmoid colon, suggesting acute appendicitis complicated by an abscess. An emergency laparotomy was performed, revealing an abscess involving both organs. An en-bloc resection of the appendix and the sigmoid colon was performed, followed by a Hartmann procedure. Histopathological analysis confirmed mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the appendix invading the sigmoid colon, with clear resection margins and no lymph node involvement (pT4b). After a normal postoperative CT scan and colonoscopy, the patient underwent a right hemicolectomy and restoration of digestive continuity, with no residual tumor found. MAA is an uncommon malignancy, and its rupture into the sigmoid colon is exceedingly rare. This case highlights the importance of prompt surgical intervention in managing complications such as abscess formation and tumor invasion. The en-bloc resection and Hartmann procedure were effective in removing the diseased tissues, and subsequent follow-up with right hemicolectomy confirmed no further tumor spread. This case demonstrates the successful management of mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma rupturing into the sigmoid colon through timely surgical intervention. This case underscores the importance of early diagnosis and aggressive treatment in achieving positive outcomes for rare malignancies."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the safety of combining radium-223 chloride (Ra-223) therapy with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for patients with multiple bone metastases from castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), including lesions requiring urgent treatment such as those causing neurological symptoms due to spinal cord compression. We retrospectively analyzed data from patients with CRPC and bone metastases treated with Ra-223 therapy at our hospital between September 1, 2018, and December 31, 2023. Adverse events were evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Of the 23 patients referred, data from 17 were included; 8 received concurrent Ra-223 therapy and EBRT, whereas others received only Ra-223 therapy. The median follow-up period was 20 months. Grade (G) 2 or higher adverse events occurred in seven patients (41.2%), and G 3 or higher in 2 (11.7%). None of the patients who received EBRT with fields involving the gastrointestinal tract experienced diarrhea, constipation, bleeding, perforation, or obstruction. Ra-223 therapy with EBRT did not increase adverse events compared with studies of Ra-223 therapy without EBRT. One case of G 5 Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, likely because of steroid use for neurological symptoms and the patient's underlying diabetes mellitus, was noted. The effects of EBRT cannot be entirely excluded, so minimizing field size and dose is recommended when combining Ra-223 therapy and EBRT. Our findings indicate that concurrent Ra-223 therapy and EBRT could be safe for managing patients with symptomatic bone metastases and castration-resistant prostate cancer who require specialized treatment, provided sufficient attention is given to the field and the prescribed dose."

    "abstract": "Appendectomy is curative for appendicitis and prolonged hospitalization is unnecessary for un-complicated disease. We implemented a protocol to expedite discharge of patients post-appendectomy. Using multiple plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles, the protocol functions in three phases of care. Pre-operatively, expectations for discharge are established, antibiotics and acetaminophen are administered. Intra-operatively, a foley catheter is avoided and the maximum dose of local analgesic, routine skin prophylaxis, ondansetron and ketorolac are administered. Post-operatively, patients with stable vital signs, pain controlled, tolerating liquids and able to mobilize are discharged. The primary outcome measured was length of stay (LOS) post-procedure. Counterbalance measures were unexpected return to the emergency department (ED) and in-patient bed utilization. Impact of PDSA cycles was quantified using statistical process control charts and Mann Whitney U test. All statistical tests were 2-sided and P value ≤ 0.05 deemed to be statistically significant. A total of 332 patients were identified over a 2-year period, 147 pre-protocol implementation, 185 afterwards. The median age was 9 years old (IQR:6-11), procedure duration 40 min (IQR 29-53). The median post-op LOS pre-protocol was 11.2 h (IQR: 7.1-16.2) compared to 1.5 h (IQR: 1.1-4.2) after implementation (P < 0.00001). There were 10 returns to the ED pre-protocol (6.8 %) and 17 after implementation (9.2 %), (p = 0.65). Pre-protocol, no patients were discharged directly from the OR compared to 68 % after implementation. There was no difference in ED LOS (median 9:03 vs 9:14, p < 0.48). Implementation of the SNAppy protocol significantly reduced the post-operative LOS and inpatient bed utilization without increasing ED returns. III."

A systematic literature review for 2018-2023 was performed, searching PubMed, MEDLINE, RSCI, CyberLeninka databases. 33 studies on the use of laparoscopy in acute surgical abdominal diseases were selected. The most convincing data have been obtained regarding laparoscopic treatment of acute appendicitis, cholecystitis, and gynecological pathology. There is a growing number of studies confirming the effectiveness of laparoscopy in intestinal obstruction, perforated ulcers, and abdominal trauma. Numerous publications indicate a reduction in the complication rate, decreased pain, shortened treatment and rehabilitation time after laparoscopic surgeries compared to open ones. At the same time, insufficient integration of the method into practice, lack of clear patient selection criteria, and the need for further standardization are noted. Laparoscopy should be considered as the method of choice in many urgent surgical conditions; however, further study and development of uniform protocols are required for wider implementation into the routine practice of emergency surgery. Лапароскопию все шире применяют в ургентной хирургии, демонстрируя ряд преимуществ перед открытыми вмешательствами. Проведен обзор литературы за 2018—2023 гг. с поиском в базах PubMed, MEDLINE, РИНЦ, КиберЛенинка. Отобрано 33 исследования, посвященных применению лапароскопии при острых хирургических заболеваниях органов брюшной полости. Наиболее убедительные данные получены в отношении лапароскопического лечения острого аппендицита, холецистита и гинекологических заболеваний. Растет количество исследований, подтверждающих эффективность лапароскопии при кишечной непроходимости, перфоративной язве, абдоминальных травмах. Многочисленные публикации указывают на снижение частоты осложнений, уменьшение боли, сокращение сроков лечения и реабилитации после лапароскопических операций в сравнении с открытыми. В то же время отмечается недостаточная интеграция метода в практику, отсутствие четких критериев отбора пациентов и необходимость дальнейшей стандартизации. Лапароскопия должна рассматриваться как метод выбора при многих ургентных хирургических состояниях, однако требуется дальнейшее изучение и выработка единых протоколов для более широкого ее внедрения в рутинную практику неотложной хирургии."

    "abstract": "To study several non-respiratory lung functions in conjunction with the respiratory component in acute abdominal diseases with different natures of the inflammatory process; to identify the key mechanisms of organ damage; and, based on the data, establish a new syndrome in urgent surgery-pulmonary distress syndrome-and evaluate the effectiveness of Remaxol in its treatment. Chronic experiments have been done on dogs. Under anesthesia, progressive acute peritonitis was simulated in the first group (24) (the first subgroup (12) received infusion therapy, the second subgroup (12) received Remaxol (20 mL/kg)), in the second group (8) acute destructive pancreatitis, in the third group (8) acute obstructive ileus. The treatment outcomes of 78 patients with acute surgical pathology of the abdomen were analyzed: 38 patients with acute peritonitis caused by destructive appendicitis, hollow viscus perforation (the first subgroup (16) received standard of care, in the second (22) Remaxol was added to the standard of care); 18 with acute severe pancreatitis complicated by enzymatic peritonitis, 22 with acute intestinal obstruction. Surgeries were performed on all the patients. The extension and type of the surgeries depended on the condition. In the early postoperative period (up to 5 days), several indicators of respiratory lung function were evaluated in the experiment and patients, and non-respiratory function was assessed using several indicators of arterial and venous blood. In the experiment, the state of lipid metabolism and the hemostasis system was assessed in lung tissues. It was established that in acute abdominal diseases, lung damage occurs regardless of the nature of the inflammatory process. It manifested not only with changes in the homeostasis indicators due to modifications of the respiratory component but also non-respiratory functions of the organ. It was shown that the signs of the non-respiratory dysfunction of the lungs, as indicated by the parameters of blood inflowing to the lungs and outflowing from the lungs, included a deterioration in their detoxification and lipid-modifying ability and changes in the blood coagulation system. The key and unifying feature of respiratory and non-respiratory lung damage in various types of inflammatory processes are disorders of the lipid metabolism of lung cells. In the pathogenesis of membrane destabilization, the peroxidation of membrane lipids and the high activity of phospholipases play a decisive role. In the pathological process, a certain role is assigned to the tissue (pulmonary) coagulation-lytic system. The inclusion of Remaxol in the treatment of acute peritonitis increased lung tolerance to trigger pathogenetic agents, as indicated by improved laboratory and clinical parameters. Experimental and clinical evidence was obtained for establishing the pathological condition (syndrome) in acute surgical abdominal diseases called pulmonary distress syndrome. Pulmonary distress syndrome in urgent surgery is a set of pathological processes of the body, with the most important manifestations being systemic homeostasis disorders due to lung damage as a result of alteration of membrane structures of cells resulting from hyperactivation of peroxidation and phospholipases and modifications of the tissue coagulation-lytic system, which is accompanied by deterioration of their respiratory (respiratory distress syndrome), detoxification, lipid-regulating, and hemostatic functions. При острых заболеваниях живота с различным характером воспалительного процесса изучить ряд недыхательных функций легких в сопряженности с респираторным компонентом; выявить ключевые механизмы поражения органа, на основе чего дать обоснование нового синдрома в ургентной хирургии — пульмонального дистресс-синдрома и установить эффективность Ремаксола в его коррекции. Хронические опыты поставлены на собаках. Под наркозом в 1-й группе (n=24) моделировали прогрессирующий острый перитонит (в 1-й подгруппе (n=12) — инфузионная терапия, во 2-й подгруппе (n=12) — терапия с Ремаксолом (20 мл/кг)), во 2-й (n=8) — острый деструктивный панкреатит, в 3-й (n=8) — острую обтурационную кишечную непроходимость. Проанализированы результаты лечения 78 пациентов с острой хирургической патологией живота: 38 — с острым перитонитом, вызванным деструктивным аппендицитом, перфорацией полых органов (в 1-й подгруппе (n=16) проводили стандартизированную терапию, во 2-й (n=22) — с включением Ремаксола); 18 — с острым тяжелым панкреатитом, осложненным ферментативным перитонитом; 22 — с острой кишечной непроходимостью. Больные оперированы. Объем и характер вмешательств зависел от патологии. В раннем послеоперационном периоде (до 5 сут) в эксперименте и у больных оценивали ряд показателей респираторной функции легких, а по ряду показателей артериальной и венозной крови — нереспираторную функцию. В эксперименте в тканях легких исследовали состояние липидного метаболизма и системы гемостаза. Установлено, что при острых заболеваниях живота поражение легких происходит вне зависимости от характера воспалительного процесса. Проявлением являются изменения не только показателей внутренней среды вследствие модификаций респираторного компонента, но и недыхательных функций органа. Доказано, что патологическими признаками нарушений нереспираторных функций легких, установленными по количественной оценке показателей в притекающей к легким и оттекающей от них крови, явились ухудшение детоксикационной и липид-модифицирующей способности, изменения ее свертывающей системы. Ключевой и объединяющей особенностью поражения легких респираторного и нереспираторного характера при различных вариантах воспалительного процесса выступают нарушения липидного метаболизма клеток легких. В патогенезе мембранодестаблизирующих явлений определяющую роль играют явления перекисного окисления мембранных липидов и высокая активность фосфолипаз. В патологическом процессе определенная роль отводится тканевой (легочной) коагуляционно-литической системе. Включение в лечение Ремаксола при остром перитоните повышало толерантность легких к триггерным патогенетическим агентам, что проявлялось в улучшении лабораторных и клинических показателей. Получены экспериментально-клинические основания для определения патологического состояния (синдрома) при острых хирургических болезнях живота под названием «пульмональный дистресс-синдром». Пульмональный дистресс-синдром в ургентной хирургии — это совокупность патологических процессов организма, важнейшим проявлением которых являются системные нарушения гомеостаза вследствие поражения легких в результате альтерации мембранных структур клеток органа, возникающей вследствие избыточной гиперактивации перекисного окисления и фосфолипаз, модификаций тканевой коагуляционно-литической системы, что сопровождается ухудшением их респираторной (респираторный дистресс-синдром), детоксикационной, липид-регулирующей, гемостастатической функций."

    "abstract": "Management strategies for small bowel obstruction (SBO) vary from conservative approaches to surgical intervention. A known complication of surgery is the subsequent adhesions that can cause recurrent SBOs, longer hospital stays, and higher treatment costs. Our primary outcome was to identify independent risk factors that are associated with the decision for surgical intervention, and our secondary outcome was to describe characteristics of visits associated with complications. This study was a single-center, retrospective chart review from a large, urban university hospital. We included adult patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) with the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Rev, codes for small bowel obstruction from June 1, 2017- May 30, 2019. Eligible covariates were demographics, radiological findings, clinical presentation, past medical history, and results of radiologic testing. We identified univariate associations of outcome and then performed a multivariate logistic regression to identify independent associations of each outcome. Finally, a backwards selection was used to determine the final model. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) along with the area under the curve (AUC), as appropriate. A total of 530 patients met the study criteria; 148 (27.9%) underwent surgery of whom 35 (6.6%) had complications. We identified seven independent associations for the decision of surgery: abdominal distension (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.10-0.62); gastrografin (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20-0.81); previous SBO (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.26-0.66); higher Charlson Comorbidity Index score (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80-0.95); nasogastric decompression (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.25-3.39), initial systolic blood pressure <100 mm Hg (OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.05-6.53); free fluid or volvulus/closed-loop obstruction on computed tomography (OR 7.95, 95% CI 4.25-15.39), with the AUC for the predictive model equaling 0.73. We identified seven independent associations present in the ED associated with the decision for surgery. These associations are a step toward building better prediction models and improving decision-making in the ED, allowing for a more adequate treatment plan."

This study was conducted from December 21, 2023, to January 4, 2024, with patients presenting to the emergency department exhibiting symptoms consistent with appendicitis. Diagnostic confirmation was achieved through clinical evaluation, radiological imaging, and histopathological examination. Pathogens isolated included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (54.2%), Escherichia coli (20.8%), and Yersinia enterocolitica (8.3%), correlating with pathogens detected in contaminated water samples. Patients with confirmed appendicitis experienced significant morbidity, including surgical site infections in two cases, which extended their hospitalization. Following water source decontamination, no new cases of appendicitis were reported, supporting a direct link between polluted water and appendicitis incidence. This study highlights the role of environmental factors in appendicitis etiology and underscores the necessity for improved water quality management in high-risk areas. Public health interventions targeting water sanitation could significantly reduce appendicitis cases and related complications, emphasizing the need for further research on environmental influences on gastrointestinal health."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common emergency in rural Kenya. While open appendectomy is widely used, minimally invasive approaches may improve postoperative recovery and superficial surgical site infection rates. However, adoption in resource-limited settings is hindered by cost and availability, with fewer than 1% of operations involving laparoscopy. This study evaluates the effectiveness and costs of laparoscopic versus open appendectomy to inform practices in similar settings. A retrospective study at Tenwek Hospital, Kenya (2015-2019), compared laparoscopic and open appendectomy using a bottom-up micro-costing method for true healthcare costs, adjusted for inflation and expressed in international dollars using purchasing power parity (I$PPP). Outcomes, including operating room turnaround time, hospital length of stay, superficial surgical site infections, and financial impact, were analyzed with Pearson's chi-squared, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, and a multilevel generalized linear model to adjust for patient comorbidities and severity. Among 168 patients, median age was 34 years (IQR: 26-44), with 71% men, and perforation in 45%. Laparoscopic surgery was performed on 31 patients, with one conversion, versus open surgery in 137. The laparoscopic group had longer operating room turnaround times (115 vs. 75 min, p < 0.001) but shorter hospital stays (2 vs. 4 days, p = 0.002). Total costs were lower for laparoscopy cases (1527 vs. 1816 I$PPP, p = 0.049), with surgical site infections (3.2% vs. 16.7%, p = 0.026). Despite longer surgery times, laparoscopic appendectomy significantly reduces hospital stays, total costs, and surgical site infections compared to open surgery in rural Kenya."

This report presents the case of a 59-year-old male farmer from a rural area of Tunisia who presented with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Diagnostic imaging revealed a large hepatic cyst with free peritoneal fluid, indicating a ruptured hydatid cyst. Emergency surgery involved cyst evacuation, peritoneal lavage, and drainage. Postoperatively, the patient developed a transient biliary fistula but recovered well with albendazole therapy to prevent recurrence. Six months post-surgery, the patient remains asymptomatic. The case underscores the importance of considering hydatid disease in acute abdomen diagnoses in endemic regions and highlights the critical role of imaging and timely surgical intervention. The literature review indicates variability in the prevalence of cyst rupture and emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach combining surgery and antiparasitic treatment for effective management and recurrence prevention."

This register-based study included keratitis cases that had undergone PK in Sweden between 2001 and 2020 and reported to the Swedish Corneal Transplant Register. During the study period, 69 eyes were subjected to acute PK due to progressive infectious keratitis. The number increased from 2 annual procedures in the first half of the study period to 5 in the second half ( P = 0.01). Preoperative corneal perforation was present in 43.5% (n = 30) of the eyes. Two years after surgery, follow-up data were completed in the register for 53 eyes; of these, 62.3% (n = 33) were considered to have functioning grafts, and 20.8% (n = 11) had experienced a rejection episode. The visual acuity improved from hand motion to counting fingers ( P = 0.002), and the proportion of eyes with a visual acuity of ≤1.0 logMAR increased from 5.7% (n = 3) before the surgery to 45.3% (n = 24) at the 2-year follow-up ( P < 0.001). The number of active infectious keratitis cases undergoing keratoplasty à chaud increased in Sweden during the 21st century. Most of the cases were successful regarding the structural integrity of the bulb, that is, \"had a saved eye\" and even a functioning graft 2 years after corneal transplantation. The visual gain was distinct, albeit modest. In cases with severe infectious keratitis, and even a concomitant perforation in the cornea due to the infection, corneal transplantation should continue to be an option."

However, effective treatment of juvenile dermatomyositis with gastrointestinal perforation remains challenging. We report the case of a patient who developed intestinal perforation 5 months after being diagnosed with anti-nuclear matrix protein 2 antibody-positive juvenile dermatomyositis. We systematically reviewed the literature on the medical and/or surgical treatment of gastrointestinal perforation in juvenile dermatomyositis. In addition to our case, as of October 2023, we identified 29 cases of gastrointestinal perforation in patients with juvenile dermatomyositis. Current treatment options for gastrointestinal perforation in juvenile dermatomyositis mainly include corticosteroids, methylprednisolone pulses, rituximab, intravenous immunoglobulin, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, cyclosporine A, mycophenolate mofetil, and other traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. Notably, juvenile dermatomyositis complicated by gastrointestinal perforation is always associated with disease severity and activity. However, these are extremely severe patients who may not respond to treatment with methylprednisolone pulses and rituximab. Given the limited efficacy of conventional high-intensity systemic immunosuppressive therapy for juvenile dermatomyositis with gastrointestinal perforation, there is an urgent need to explore novel therapeutic approaches. We report on the successful use of vedolizumab in combination with corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and intravenous immunoglobulin as a novel therapeutic strategy for treating juvenile dermatomyositis complicated by gastrointestinal perforation. Importantly, up to now, there has been no report of juvenile dermatomyositis with gastrointestinal perforation treated with vedolizumab combined with traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs in children."

    "abstract": "Meckel's diverticulum (MD), a congenital abnormality occurring in 0.3% to 3% of individuals, shares overlapping clinical features with acute appendicitis (AA), a common surgical emergency, making simultaneous presentation diagnostically challenging. An 11-year-old boy presented with right lower abdominal pain, fever, and loss of appetite, exhibiting positive Rovsing and Psoas signs. Elevated inflammatory markers and ultrasound findings suggested acute appendicitis with concurrent Meckel's diverticulitis. Surgery confirmed acute suppurative appendicitis and an inflamed MD, both of which were successfully treated with appendectomy and segmental intestinal resection. The patient had an uneventful recovery and remained well during follow-up. This case highlights the importance of considering MD in pediatric abdominal pain and performing thorough intraoperative assessments to ensure accurate diagnosis and effective treatment."

    "abstract": "Amyand's hernia is a rare form of inguinal hernia, where the appendix is located within the inguinal sac. A 66-year-old male presented with an obstructed, incarcerated right inguinal hernia. He underwent an emergency herniotomy under spinal anesthesia. Intraoperatively, the hernia sac contained a viable small bowel and part of the appendix. As the appendix appeared mildly inflamed, an appendicectomy was performed, and a synthetic mesh repair was done. He received a postoperative course of antibiotics and was discharged home on day 3 after an uneventful recovery. Histology of the appendix revealed a fecolith in the absence of acute inflammation. He did not have any procedure-related complications on follow-up. Preoperative diagnosis of Amyand's hernia is a challenge due to nonspecific symptoms and rarity. Lasanoff and Basson classify Amyand's hernia and provide surgical guidance for its management. Our case belonged to the type 2 category. Management of Amyand's hernia needs an individually tailored approach rather than strict adherence to conventional guidelines. The presence of an appendicular fecolith in the absence of inflammation provides an interesting area to explore in an Amyand's hernia."

    "abstract": "Antibiotic prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBPPr) in patients with cirrhosis has been considered the standard of care since the 1990s and is currently recommended by several major gastroenterological societies. However, the evidence that supports this practice is weak, and there is no clear mortality benefit. The unintended consequences of this strategy are not insignificant, both at the patient and population levels. Recent evidence suggests that SBPPr may even cause harm. Since the widespread implementation of SBPPr 3 decades ago, our overall approach to antibiotic use has shifted. We now recognize the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance, the potential harms of antibiotics, and the vital role of antimicrobial stewardship. In light of recent developments and evidence, there is an urgent need for infectious diseases, antimicrobial stewardship, and hepatology leaders to collaborate in development of an updated and cohesive approach to SBPPr."

    "abstract": "Appendico-ileal knotting is an extremely rare complication of acute appendicitis resulting in small bowel obstruction (SBO) and potential strangulation. It accounts for a negligible fraction of SBO cases, with only a handful of cases reported globally in the literature. The condition arises when an inflamed or gangrenous appendix forms a knot around the ileum, often exacerbated by adhesions or anatomical variations, leading to closed-loop obstruction and, if untreated, bowel strangulation and gangrene. A 34-year-old female presented with four days of crampy mid-abdominal pain, nausea, bilious vomiting, and absence of bowel movements. Examination revealed generalized peritonitis, diffuse tenderness with guarding, and rigidity, accompanied by leukocytosis. An emergency laparotomy uncovered hemorrhagic fluid and an inflamed appendix wrapping around the distal ileum, causing a closed-loop obstruction with necrotic-appearing bowel. Following hemicolectomy, ileostomy, and appendectomy, the patient stabilized, was weaned off vasopressors, and recovered uneventfully. Discharged on postoperative day seven and followed up regularly, she eventually underwent ileostomy reversal three months later without complications. Acute appendicitis rarely leads to SBO through appendico-ileal knotting. Preoperative diagnosis is challenging due to its rarity and non-specific radiologic features. Surgical management varies from simple appendectomy to resection of gangrenous bowel, with decisions guided by intraoperative findings. High clinical suspicion, prompt recognition, and timely surgical intervention ensure better outcomes in appendico-ileal knotting."

    "abstract": "Small bowel volvulus involves the twisting of an intestinal loop around the axis of its mesenteric attachment. Although rare, it is a potential complication of laparoscopic surgery, and every surgeon should be well aware of it. We present a case of a 64-year-old patient admitted to our department with acute gastrointestinal obstruction six days after a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. CT showed dilated small intestine with a maximum diameter of 50 mm and a 2 cm subhepatic collection in the gallbladder bed. Emergency open surgery through a midline incision revealed necrosis of the twisted small intestinal loop, necessitating resection, and primary intestinal anastomosis. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on the eighth post-operative day. Small intestinal volvulus, even not a common complication following laparoscopic cholecystectomy, is nonetheless a serious condition that warrants careful clinical examination and imaging. The mechanism underlying this complication remains unclear; however, a review of similar cases in the English literature highlights several potential contributing factors. These include un-retrieved gallstones, anatomical abnormalities, and prior abdominal surgeries resulting in peritoneal adhesions and notably, in one case adhesions to a metallic clip. Interestingly, concerning our case, the volvulus appeared to result from a loop of bowel rotating around its mesenteric attachment with parietal adhesions acting as a pivot. In addition, we believe that the abscess, despite its 2 cm diameter, may have contributed to the postoperative ileus and thus facilitated the torsion of the small intestine creating a volvulus. Persistent postoperative abdominal pain and distention should not overshadow the possibility of acute intestinal obstruction after laparoscopy. Delayed diagnosis of bowel volvulus can lead to severe consequences, underscoring the importance of vigilance in postoperative assessments."

    "abstract": "Adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is a rare, nonobstetrical abdominal emergency. Optimal management of ASBO during pregnancy remains unknown. This study analyzes management trends and outcomes of pregnant patients with ASBO in the United States. The National Inpatient Sample was queried for pregnant women diagnosed with ASBO from January 2003 to September 2015. Patients were grouped into three management strategies: nonoperative management (NOM), immediate operation (from admission to hospital day 1), or delayed operation (after hospital day 1). Multivariable regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between management strategies and maternal or perinatal complications. The impact of delayed operation on patient outcomes was also assessed. A total of 4,266 pregnant patients with ASBO were identified: 1,974 (46.3%) were managed nonoperatively, 1,177 (27.6%) underwent immediate operation, and 1,115 (26.1%) underwent delayed operation. The rate of NOM did not significantly change over the study period. Compared with NOM, immediate operation was not associated with increased complication rates, whereas delayed operation was associated with higher rates of maternal septic shock (odds ratio [OR], 5.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-29.21; p = 0.04) and preterm labor, delivery, or abortion (OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.56-3.72; p < 0.001). In analysis of patients who underwent surgery, each day of delay in operation was associated with a 14% higher chance of preterm labor, delivery, or abortion (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.08-1.21; p < 0.001). Pregnant patients presenting with ASBO were often managed operatively. Delay to operation was associated with increased odd of maternal and perinatal complications. Surgeons should be involved early in determining the optimal management for ASBO. Therapeutic/Care Management; Level IV."

    "title": "Short- and Long-term Outcomes of One-stage Radical Resection and Anastomosis without Preoperative Decompression and Diverting Stoma between Incomplete Obstructive and Non-obstructive Left-sided Colorectal Cancer: A Retrospective Observational Study.",
    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the safety and long-term outcomes of a one-stage resection and anastomosis approach without preoperative decompression in patients with left-sided incomplete obstructive colorectal cancer. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 571 patients diagnosed with pT3-4NanyM0 left-sided colorectal cancer who underwent radical resection and primary anastomosis without preoperative decompression or a diverting stoma from April 2012 to December 2019. Of these, 97 (17%) patients presented with incomplete obstruction, while 474 (83%) had no obstruction. Incomplete obstruction was characterized by the inability of a small-caliber endoscope to pass through the tumor without necessitating emergency surgery or decompression due to bowel obstruction. We compared perioperative short-term outcomes, as well as the 5-year overall survival rate and the 5-year relapse-free survival rate between the two groups. Patients in the incomplete obstruction group experienced significantly longer median intervals between admission and surgery (6 vs. 2 days, P<0.001), higher complication rates (25.8% vs. 15%, P=0.016), and longer median postoperative hospital stays (10 vs. 9 days, P=0.002). However, the rates of anastomotic leakage (2.1% vs. 2.3%, P=1), the 5-year overall survival (91.5% vs. 93.7%, P=0.436), and the 5-year relapse-free survival (80.2% vs. 85.6%, P=0.195) were comparable between the groups. The outcomes regarding anastomotic leakage and long-term survival for one-stage resection and anastomosis without preoperative decompression in cases of incomplete obstructive colorectal cancer are promising. This management strategy appears feasible and safe with appropriate preoperative bowel preparation."

    "title": "Is Routine Group and Save Sampling Necessary for Emergency Laparoscopic Appendicectomy?",
    "abstract": "Background Laparoscopic appendicectomy is a commonly used approach for the surgical management of acute appendicitis. If complications arise, a blood transfusion may be necessary for patients undergoing emergency appendicectomy. The need for routine group and save (G&S) sampling prior to emergency laparoscopic appendicectomy remains a subject of ongoing discussion. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether routine G&S sampling is needed prior to emergency laparoscopic appendicectomy. Methods The present study retrospectively reviewed G&S sampling for emergency laparoscopic appendicectomy cases over a six-month period at two hospital sites in the United Kingdom: Croydon University Hospital (June 1, 2024, to November 30, 2024) and Tunbridge Wells Hospital (October 1, 2023, to April 30, 2024). A total of 304 patients across both sites were included in the review. Results In 2023, 23 procedures (7.6%) were performed, while 279 procedures (92.4%) occurred in 2024. The patient population consisted of 46.4% males (n = 141) and 53.6% females (n = 163), with a mean age of 37.1 years (median 33, range 6-84). A total of 406 G&S samples were collected, of which 351 (86.5%) were processed and 55 (13.5%) were rejected by the blood bank. From the sample size, only one patient received a blood transfusion prior to surgery due to a low hemoglobin level of 72 g/L, likely resulting from the delayed presentation of a perforated appendix. Conclusion This study suggests that omitting routine G&S sampling is safe for patients undergoing emergency laparoscopic appendicectomy. Hence, an individualized risk assessment approach should be used to identify high-risk patients requiring preoperative G&S sampling."

The aim of this study was to determine whether there are factors in presentation associated with NA or MA. This is a single-centre, retrospective chart review of histology-confirmed appendicitis over an eight-year period. We defined MA as appendicitis diagnosed within the week of a paediatric emergency department discharge for a similar presentation. Negative appendectomy was defined as a histologic examination of the appendix that lacked signs of inflammation. A total of 845 children had appendicitis on pathologic examination. NA included 69 children, and MA 29 children. Inflammatory markers were lower for children with NA than for children with appendicitis, and children with NA were less likely to undergo CT. Almost half of the children with MA were discharged without laboratory evaluation, and almost three quarters were discharged without imaging evaluation. Half of the children with MA returned with complicated appendicitis. Increased rates of laboratory and/or imaging evaluations in patients with abdominal pain or non-classic gastroenteritis, along with observation or early follow-up, may decrease MA. More frequent use of ultrasound and MRI may keep the NA rate to a minimum."

    "abstract": "Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is a common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract, present in approximately 2% of the population. While typically asymptomatic, MD can lead to complications such as obstruction and intussusception. Here, we present a case report of a man presenting with abdominal pain with an incidental finding of MD complicated by intussusception and our management approach. A 39-year-old man with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC) presented with sudden severe right iliac fossa pain, vomiting, and a background of intermittent dull abdominal pain over three months. Examination revealed a tender abdominal mass in the right iliac fossa. Despite his UC history, imaging revealed ileo-ileal intussusception with an inverted MD serving as the lead point, a rare finding in adults. The patient underwent emergency surgery, including resection of the intussuscepted bowel segment and side-to-side anastomosis. Histopathology confirmed ulceration and granulation tissue within the MD. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged with follow-up care. This case underscores the diagnostic challenge posed by intussusception in adults, especially when overlapping symptoms suggest more common conditions like a UC flare-up. It highlights the importance of considering less frequent diagnoses, such as MD-induced intussusception, in acute abdominal presentations, and reinforces the utility of CT imaging in identifying atypical causes of bowel obstruction. The case also emphasises the need for surgical intervention in symptomatic MD cases to prevent complications."

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of stercoral colitis, including presentation, diagnosis, and emergency department (ED) management based on the available evidence. Stercoral colitis is an uncommon inflammatory condition of the distal large bowel and rectum resulting from accumulation of impacted stool and is associated with several complications including bowel ulceration, ischemia, perforation, peritonitis, and sepsis. Though most commonly present with abdominal pain and constipation, many patients present without typical symptoms requiring emergency clinicians to maintain high clinical suspicion, especially in patients at high risk for developing severe constipation. The diagnosis can be secured with cross-sectional radiography, including computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis. ED management includes fluid resuscitation, initiation of a multimodal bowel regimen, and if indicated, initiation of parenteral antibiotics and consultation with a surgical specialist. Admission to the hospital should be considered for all patients with stercoral colitis. An understanding of stercoral colitis can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and appropriately managing this high risk disease."

It has been documented that clinically silent PDAs may cause infective complications of heart valves. We present case of an 18-years-old male who presented with palpitations and fever to our emergency department. The fever was sudden in onset, associated with rigors, high-grade and with a continuous pattern for 12 days. The patient was previously managed as a case of dengue fever based on serology. Eight days after the onset of fever, the patient developed left-sided chest pain. Past medical record showed documentation of a patent ductus arteriosus. A two-dimensional echocardiography showed circumferential pericardial effusion and a small-sized PDA; the left ventricular function was normal. Nevertheless, the definitive cause of the pericardial effusion was not known. The patient became haemodynamically unstable during the hospital stay and it was planned to ligate the PDA with cardiac surgical consultation. A left thoracotomy approach was chosen for the PDA ligation that unveiled rupture of the main pulmonary artery, so the pulmonary artery repair alongside the PDA ligation was planned with median sternotomy approach and cardiopulmonary bypass immediately. The patient had a 14-days course of antibiotics during the ICU stay. In conclusion, infective endocarditis remains a rare yet life-threatening complication of PDA irrespective of the size; a timely PDA-ligation could prevent the life-threatening sequels."

    "abstract": "Management of urethral trauma lacks clarity in the paediatric population. There is no clear guidance for management and follow-up of these patients which can lead to missing the long-term sequelae of the primary injury. Catheter-associated urethral injuries are less likely to cause a complete transaction of the urethra. This is due to the mechanism, typically caused by creating a false passage or inflating the balloon in the urethra. In partial urethral injuries, the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines suggest follow-up after one-two weeks of bladder drainage or a urethrogram.  The purpose of this study was to review literature related to the management and follow-up of catheter-induced urethral injuries, subsequently comparing this to a case series in a single paediatric tertiary centre. The aim was to propose a unique algorithm to safely and effectively guide clinicians for this presentation. In our case series, 11 of 12 required initial bladder drainage. The data demonstrated an inconsistent approach to investigations throughout their admissions. Most cases had a successful trial without catheter (TWOC) or ability to resume continuous intermittent catheterisation. One patient needed a vesicostomy. We had a single bulbar urethral stricture, which wouldn't permit an 8fr catheter. This was managed using cystoscopy and serial urethral dilations. Our cohort is likely an underrepresentation of the actual number of catheter-related injuries in our institute. Some injuries are managed by the parent team without referring to paediatric urologists if spontaneous micturition occurs or if they manage to catheterise after an initial traumatic attempt.  Conclusion: Catheter-related urethral injuries are common but underreported. They are less likely to have long-term sequelae than other mechanisms of trauma. The majority of cases do well following a period of initial bladder drainage. Current practise varies even in one institute as there are no clear management and follow-up guidance in current literature. Our proposed algorithm is a useful tool and decreases the incidence of missing long-term sequelae. Management algorithm: Post urethral injury, a child who is passing urine with conservative management is likely to have good long-term function. They would require re-assessment after discharge. In clinic they would require urinary flow assessment and post-void residuals. If not toilet trained, parental impression of whether their child's stream is interrupted or if they strain during urination would be assessed. Back-pressure changes would be considered on ultrasound scan (USS). If the assessment indicates concern, then a micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG) assessment for children younger than one or a cystoscopic assessment for children older than one would be recommended. Post urethral injury, if a child is unable to pass urine conservatively, then an urgent urological assessment would be appropriate. An attempt at catheterisation would be made. If unsuccessful, the patient would be assessed for theatre. If unfit for it, an ultrasound-guided suprapubic (SP) catheter would be advised. If the patient is fit, then a cystoscopic and wire-guided catheter would be preferred. Later, if they passed a TWOC, they would be managed as per the algorithm described above. If they failed the TWOC, MCUG would be proceeded to. Catheter management and regular follow-up, or for a definitive intervention would be planned for."

    "abstract": "Colonic obstructions present a serious medical emergency that requires prompt surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening complications. Cecostomy, a procedure involving the creation of an opening in the cecum to decompress the colon, serves as one surgical approach for managing these obstructions. The aim of this review is to evaluate the effectiveness and benefits of cecostomies in emergency surgical settings, with a focus on recent clinical studies and case reports. Cecostomy is highlighted as a bridge procedure in cases such as obstructive carcinomas, providing data on success rates, relative survival, and clinical effectiveness. The importance of the patient's condition and surgeon expertise in selecting cecostomy as a procedure is emphasized. Further comparative research is suggested to optimize the selection criteria, providing a strong, clinically oriented conclusion. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify studies and case reports focusing on the application of cecostomies in cases of acute colonic obstruction. Articles were selected based on their relevance to emergency surgery, the effectiveness of cecostomies, and patient outcomes in various clinical scenarios, including obstructive carcinomas and colonic pseudo-obstructions. The analysis reveals that cecostomies provide rapid decompression and effective relief from colonic obstruction, particularly when immediate intervention is needed to prevent bowel perforation or ischemia. In several cases, cecostomies act as a bridge to more definitive surgical treatments, such as resection and anastomosis, and are associated with reduced morbidity and mortality. The selection of cecostomy as a preferred procedure depends on the patient's condition, location of the obstruction, and surgeon expertise. Cecostomies play a crucial role in the emergency management of colonic obstructions, offering a viable and sometimes lifesaving alternative for rapid decompression. Understanding the indications and appropriate use of cecostomies can enhance patient outcomes and provide surgeons with effective strategies for managing acute colonic obstructions. Further research is warranted to refine selection criteria and to compare outcomes between cecostomies and other decompressive techniques in emergency settings."

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) algorithms for improving the preoperative diagnosis of acute appendicitis in children, focusing on the accurate prediction of the severity of disease. An anonymized clinical and operative dataset was retrieved from the medical records of children undergoing emergency appendectomy between 2014 and 2021. We developed an ML pipeline that pre-processed the dataset and developed algorithms to predict 5 appendicitis grades (1 - non-perforated, 2 - localized perforation, 3 - abscess, 4 - generalized peritonitis, and 5 - generalized peritonitis with abscess). Imputation strategies were used for missing values and upsampling techniques for infrequent classes. Standard classifier models were tested. The best combination of imputation strategy, class balancing technique and classification model was chosen based on validation performance. Model explainability was verified by a pediatric surgeon. Our model's performance was compared to another pediatric appendicitis severity prediction tool. The study used a retrospective cohort including 1980 patients (60.6 % males, average age 10.7 years). Grade of appendicitis in the cohort was as follows: grade 1-70 %; grade 2-8 %; grade 3-7 %; grade 4-7 %; grade 5-8 %. Every combination of 6 imputation strategies, 7 class-balancing techniques, and 5 classification models was tested. The best-performing combined ML pipeline distinguished non-perforated from perforated appendicitis with 82.8 ± 0.2 % NPV and 56.4 ± 0.4 % PPV, and differentiated between severity grades with 70.1 ± 0.2 % accuracy and 0.77 ± 0.00 AUROC. The other pediatric appendicitis severity prediction tool gave an accuracy of 71.4 %, AUROC of 0.54 and NPV/PPV of 71.8/64.7. Prediction of appendiceal perforation outperforms prediction of the continuum of appendicitis grades. The variables our models primarily rely on to make predictions are consistent with clinical experience and the literature, suggesting that the ML models uncovered useful patterns in the dataset. Our model outperforms the other pediatric appendicitis prediction tools. The ML model developed for grade prediction is the first of this type, offering a novel approach for assessing appendicitis severity in children preoperatively. Following external validation and silent clinical testing, this ML model has the potential to enable personalized severity-based treatment of pediatric appendicitis and optimize resource allocation for its management."

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute virus infection, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The Swiss government decreed a public lockdown to reduce and restrict further infections. The aim of this investigation was to analyze the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown on the performance of general and visceral surgery procedures. A retrospective study was performed on the basis of the surgical registry of the working group for quality assurance in surgery (\"Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Qualitätssicherung in der Chirurgie\" or AQC). All patients with specific surgical diagnoses (complicated gastric or duodenal ulcer, acute appendicitis, hernia, diverticular disease, gallstone disease, pilonidal sinus, cutaneous and perianal abscess) were analyzed during 2019 and the corresponding lockdown period of March 14 through April 26, 2020. Data regarding patients' characteristics, diagnoses, and treatments were analyzed. In total, 3,330 patients were analyzed, with 2,203 patients treated in 2019 and 1,127 patients treated in 2020. There was a reduction in the number of all investigated diagnoses during the pandemic period, with statistically significant differences in acute appendicitis, hernia, diverticular disease, gallstone disease, pilonidal sinus (all p < 0.001), and cutaneous abscess (p = 0.01). The proportion of complicated appendicitis (p = 0.02), complicated hernia (p < 0.001), and complicated gallstone disease (choledocholithiasis p = 0.01; inflammation, p = 0.001) was significantly higher during the lockdown period. The surgical urgency rate in all patients was higher during the lockdown period compared to the control period (p < 0.001). The socioeconomic lockdown significantly impacted the number of general and visceral surgery procedures in Switzerland. The reasons for the reduction are multifactorial."

    "abstract": "Identify rate and associated risk factors for dehiscence following gastrotomy for foreign material removal. Medical records from 2 private practice emergency and referral hospitals were reviewed, and history, laboratory values, intraoperative findings, and outcomes were collected on 271 dogs and 31 cats (n = 302). Hospital A performed 222 procedures and Hospital B performed 80 procedures. Three cats (3 of 31 [10%]) and 20 dogs (20 of 271 [7%]) had intraoperative intestinal perforations. Two cats (2 of 31 [6.5%]) and 7 dogs (7 of 271 [2.6%]) were diagnosed with preoperative septic peritonitis. Concurrent surgical procedures in felines included enterotomy (3 of 31 [10%]), multiple enterotomies (3 of 31 [10%]), intestinal resection and anastomosis (IR&A; 2 of 31 [6%]), and other (1 of 31 [3%]). Concurrent surgical procedures in canines included enterotomy (55 of 271 [20%]), multiple enterotomies (11 of 271 [4%]), IR&A (24 of 271 [9%]), IR&A and enterotomy (1 of 271 [0.4%]), splenectomy (11 of 271 [4%]), and other (50 of 271 [18%]). There was no proven gastrotomy dehiscence. Two patients that did not have follow-up surgery or necropsy before euthanasia developed postoperative septic peritonitis, and gastrotomy dehiscence could not be ruled out as a differential diagnosis. Assuming neither patient, 1 patient, or both patients had gastrotomy dehiscence, the gastrotomy dehiscence rate was 0% to 0.66%. However, these patients also had an IR&A. Two cases were presumed to have gastrotomy dehiscence, as the authors would rather overestimate the dehiscence rate. However, it is more likely that the IR&A was the dehiscence site rather than the gastrotomy. Gastrotomy dehiscence rate is low in cats and dogs, and the dehiscence rate reported in this study may be an overestimation."

    "abstract": "Laparoscopic surgery is widely performed for acute appendicitis. We started conventional 3-port laparoscopic appendectomy (CLA) in 1995 and introduced single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy (SILA) in 2009. This study compared perioperative outcomes between SILA and CLA to evaluate the usefulness of SILA. Retrospective observational study. The study included 568 patients who underwent emergency or semi-emergency surgery for acute appendicitis (327 by CLA and 241 by SILA) at our hospital between January 2009 and December 2020. Perioperative outcomes were compared between SILA and CLA after adjusting for patient demographics by propensity score matching (PSM). PSM gave a matched sample of 224 patients in each of the CLA and SILA groups. There were significant differences between the two groups in time to initiation of oral intake, frequency of postoperative analgesic use, and length of postoperative hospital stay. Time to oral intake was significantly shorter in the SILA group (p = 0.02). Frequency of use of all analgesics, flurbiprofen axetil, and loxoprofen sodium was significantly higher in the SILA group (p < 0.01, p = 0.04, p < 0.01, respectively). The length of postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter in the SILA group (p < 0.01). The incidence of postoperative complications did not differ significantly between the two groups. Although SILA required significantly more postoperative analgesics than CLA, pain could be controlled by oral analgesics, and patients could be discharged earlier. Postoperative complications were comparable between the two groups. SILA was a safe and feasible procedure for adult acute appendicitis."

    "abstract": "Internal hernias are characterized by the protrusion of abdominal viscera through congenital or acquired apertures within the abdominal cavity and are a recognized etiology of intestinal obstruction. Internal hernias can cause symptoms ranging from mild abdominal discomfort to complete intestinal obstruction. Transomental hernias are often associated with postoperative anatomical changes and are rare in patients without prior abdominal surgeries. This report details one case of a 31-year-old otherwise healthy female with no history of prior surgery, highlighting the clinical variability associated with internal hernias.  The patient presented with severe epigastric pain and nausea, with initial ultrasound findings unremarkable. Hours later, she returned with left iliac fossa pain and vomiting. A CT scan of the abdomen with contrast showed free fluid and dilated bowel loops, suggestive of small bowel obstruction. Emergency laparoscopy revealed small bowel herniation through a congenital omental band and ischemia, which resolved after the band was released. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged on day three. Transomental herniation exhibits nonspecific clinical symptoms of bowel obstruction. Radiographic presentations are generally nonspecific; however, a conclusive diagnosis is typically reached during surgery, where the detection of gangrenous bowel tissue is common, especially during exploratory laparoscopy. The postoperative mortality is largely attributed to bowel necrosis and delays in initiating treatment. This emphasizes the significant risk posed by undiagnosed cases and the critical importance of timely and effective intervention."

A Chinese gravida 2, para 1 female presented at 32 weeks and 5 days of gestation with decreased fetal movements. Fetal ultrasound and MRI revealed small intestinal torsion and obstruction. Due to fetal distress, an emergency cesarean section was performed, followed by an urgent laparotomy on the neonate to untwist the intestinal volvulus and resect the necrotic bowel segment. Fetal intestinal volvulus. Following an emergency cesarean section, the neonate was promptly transferred to the surgical department for immediate surgical intervention. The procedure encompassed detorsion of the intestinal volvulus and resection of the necrotic bowel segment. The infant exhibited a satisfactory postoperative recovery, successfully transitioned to complete oral and gastrointestinal nutrition, and demonstrated normal physical growth and cognitive development during the ensuing follow-up period. Fetal intestinal volvulus requires multidisciplinary collaboration for diagnosis and treatment. Early recognition, prompt delivery, and urgent surgical intervention are crucial for optimizing neonatal outcomes. By sharing this case, we hope to enhance the diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities of healthcare providers in managing this rare but severe condition."

    "abstract": "Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is the most common congenital abnormality of the gastrointestinal tract. It usually lies on the antimesenteric side of the ileum, about 60 cm from the ileocecal valve. Histologically, it is a true diverticulum comprising all four layers of the intestinal tract. Complications associated with MD include bleeding, bowel obstruction, intussusception, and inflammation (diverticulitis). A 12-year-old boy presented to the emergency department with a one-day history of right iliac fossa pain. He had rebound tenderness and localized peritonism. The inflammatory markers were raised. He was listed for an emergency laparoscopic appendicectomy. Intraoperatively, a large necrotic MD was identified, twisted on its pedicle. In addition, a fibrous band extended from the tip of the diverticulum to the posterior aspect of the anterior abdominal wall. A closed-loop, discoloured terminal ileal volvulus with proximal small bowel dilatation was noted. The band was released by sharp dissection, and the terminal ileum volvulus was freed with the return of normal colour and circulation. The gangrenous Meckel's diverticulum was excised at its pedicle by ECHELON FLEX™ ENDOPATH® staplers (Ethicon, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson company, Raritan, NJ). The postoperative recovery was uneventful. Early laparoscopic intervention prevented irreversible small bowel ischaemia that may have resulted in resection of the terminal ileum in a child."

    "title": "Concurrent Meckel's Diverticulum and Sjögren Syndrome: A Case of Intestinal Obstruction.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Meckel's diverticulum is a congenital diverticulum that contains all normal layers of the gastrointestinal wall. In adults, Meckel's diverticulum can present with bowel obstruction, the most common presentation, in 35.6% of cases. In addition, complicated Meckel's diverticulum can present with small bowel obstruction. Sjögren syndrome is a rare systemic autoimmune disorder. The theory behind Sjögren syndrome is that lymphocyte-rich mononuclear cell foci infiltrate exocrine glandular tissue, and humoral factors, such as antibodies and cytokines, cause dysfunction to the exocrine glands, leading to diminished saliva and tear production and skin, tracheobronchial, and vaginal dryness. Sjögren syndrome can present with intestinal pseudo-obstruction as a rare complication. CASE REPORT A 25-year-old woman with a known case of Sjögren syndrome presented to the Emergency Department with abdominal pain. Laboratory investigations were sent, and all results were within reference values. Multiple imaging studies were done, and findings indicated the presence of ileus, rather than bowel, obstruction. Consequently, she was admitted under general surgery, and laparoscopic exploration was done, which showed Meckel's diverticulum. The patient was discharged home in a stable state. Two weeks later, a colonoscopy was done, showing a normal study. CONCLUSIONS It is important to consider Meckel's diverticulum as a possible cause of sudden abdominal pain in adults, as it can have catastrophic consequences. Furthermore, studies have shown that Meckel's diverticulum and Sjögren syndrome are distinct entities. Yet, both conditions can present with symptoms of intestinal obstruction."

    "abstract": "Neuroendocrine neoplasms of the appendix (aNET) are rare tumors that are often diagnosed by pathology as an incidental finding after appendectomy for acute appendicitis. Several guidelines proposed risk criteria to indicate oncological completion surgery after appendectomy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of proposed criteria for completion surgery of aNET. Patients with aNET treated at ENETS center of excellence Marburg between 2002 and 2022 were retrieved from a prospective data base. Demographic data, histopathological findings, including formerly proposed criteria to indicate oncological completion surgery, histological results of the completion resection and disease-free survival were evaluated. 82 patients with a median age of 35 (range 8-82) years were analysed. 72 (88%) patients underwent an emergency appendectomy because of acute appendicitis. 11 (13%) patients received an ileocecal resection or right hemicolectomy. Seven (8.5%) patients had lymph node metastases and three (3.6%) patients had distant metastases at the initial operation. 27 (33%) patients underwent completion surgery by right hemicolectomy according to guideline criteria, but postoperative histology detected lymph node and distant metastases in only six (22%) and zero patients resulting in an overtreatment of 21 (75%) patients. A tumor size of > 2 cm was the only significant criterion which was associated with lymph node metastases (p < 0.05). After a median follow-up of 62 months (range 2-264) 76 (96%) of the patients in stages I to III were alive with no evidence of disease. aNET have an excellent prognosis in stages I-III and distant metastases are rare. Formerly proposed criteria for oncological completion surgery have to be adopted and discussed for every patient, as they might result in an overtreatment in at least 75% of patients."

    "abstract": "Rotablator-associated coronary perforation can be fatal if bailout is delayed. Successful bailout is typically defined as the disappearance of contrast extravasation after a haemostatic intervention. We report a case of recurrent cardiac tamponade in the subacute phase, wherein haemostasis appeared to have been achieved on angiography following the implantation of a covered stent during the index procedure.A 61-year-old male underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention with a rotator placed in the middle of the left ascending artery. Coronary perforation occurred during rotablation and was treated with a covered stent. However, cardiac tamponade recurred on postoperative day 30. Emergency coronary angiography was performed, and no contrast extravasation was observed on angiography. However, intravascular ultrasonography was performed to clarify the cause of the recurrent pericardial effusion and revealed that the distal edge of the covered stent was not fully attached to the vessel wall due to protruding calcification. Another covered stent was placed distal to the previous stent for sealing the malapposed site. There was no recurrence of pericardial effusion.Malapposition of covered stents may not be detected by angiography alone, potentially resulting in recurrent bleeding. Intravascular imaging is an effective tool to confirm adequate stent apposition."

Commonly used antibiotic endpoints include normalization of white blood cell count (WBC) or completion of a minimum number of prespecified treatment days. We compared clinical outcomes resulting from varying postoperative antibiotic protocols for complicated appendicitis in children. National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Pediatric (NSQIP-P) data from nine children's hospitals was used to identify a retrospective cohort of children (<18 years) who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy from 2021 to 2023 with intraoperative findings of complicated appendicitis. Participating hospitals were classified into four groups based on discharge protocol: 1) no discharge antibiotics, 2) oral antibiotics for elevated WBC on the day of discharge, 3) oral antibiotics to complete a minimum number of total antibiotic days, and 4) routine discharge antibiotics regardless of inpatient antibiotic duration. Univariate analysis was completed between groups. We identified 1342 patients with complicated appendicitis who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy. Patients were similar by age and BMI. Median length of stay (5 days) and rate of post-discharge percutaneous drainage (9.4 %) were highest at the center with a standardized minimum duration of discharge antibiotics. There were no statistical differences among treatment groups for surgical site infection (5.7-9.8 %), emergency department visits (9.0-15.6 %), or readmissions within 30 days (2.9-7.6 %). The incidence of SSI and readmission following appendectomy did not differ based on the discharge antibiotic protocol, however, the incidence of post-discharge drainage was highest in the center with protocolized discharge antibiotics. These findings highlight an opportunity to minimize unnecessary blood draws and extended postoperative antibiotics. III."

    "abstract": "Although abdominal organ damage due to motor vehicle accident is often evident immediately after the injury and urgent operation is performed, it has been reported that minor injuries such as hollow viscus may become apparent during the course of treatment and require urgent surgery. The Authors present the case of a 42-year-old female who developed peritonitis immediately after undergoing surgery for thoracolumbar fracture-dislocation caused by a traffic accident. The patient exhibited no abdominal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, or abdominal wall rigidity, and had no difficulty with oral intake preoperatively. The patient was consulted to an abdominal surgeon, who proceeded with an emergency surgery. Intraoperatively, the duodenal injury was identified and meticulously repaired. Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for ongoing critical care management. By postoperative day 60, the patient was able to walk independently and was discharged. Preoperative diagnosis of patients with delayed bowel obstruction due to seat belt injuries poses a challenging task for surgeons. The diagnosis and treatment of isolated duodenal injuries has been reported to be difficult because of the retroperitoneal organ. In the clinical management of seatbelt injuries, attention should not be exclusively directed toward the more conspicuous spinal fractures, but the possibility of concomitant bowel injuries must also be carefully considered. Treatment should be carried out with the awareness that intestinal injuries may be present, even in the absence of abdominal symptoms during the initial examination."

    "abstract": "A two-month-old developmentally normal full-term female presented with severe feeding intolerance, progressive weight loss, and persistent fussiness, leading to multiple emergency department visits and eventual hospitalization. Initial evaluations, including laboratory tests and imaging, were unremarkable, prompting a series of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. A multidisciplinary approach, including empiric gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) therapy, was started. A gastric emptying study, upper GI, and endoscopy were done. She underwent gastrostomy tube (G-tube) placement, during which a gastric wall perforation was identified and managed intraoperatively. Multiple attempts at nutritional management, including nasoduodenal tube placement and total parenteral nutrition, were met with limited success. Gastroparesis and visceral hyperalgesia were suspected as underlying causes. Unlike previous cases documented in patients with a history of cardiac surgery, this neurologically normal patient had no such surgical history. A trial of gabapentin for possible visceral hyperalgesia resulted in a gradual improvement in oral tolerance and significant improvement with fussiness and discomfort. The patient was discharged at four months of age with gastrojejunal tube feeds and ongoing medical therapy. In this case, we highlight the utility of a gabapentin trial in an otherwise healthy patient. This case underscores the complexities of managing severe feeding disorders in infants, particularly the role of gabapentin in addressing suspected visceral hyperalgesia and failure to thrive in a patient without previous neurological or cardiac surgery."

    "title": "Gut decontamination in the poisoned patient.",
    "abstract": "Poisoning management includes gastrointestinal decontamination strategies to decrease the burden of poison entering the body and change the expected severe toxicity expected to a less toxic, more favourable outcome. Common modalities are orogastric lavage, oral-activated charcoal and whole-bowel irrigation. Endoscopic retrieval and laparotomy are rare options reserved for severe ingestions and body packers. Although supporting data are generally of low quality, gastrointestinal decontamination is likely to improve patient outcome in many situations. Unfortunately, technical limitations and contraindications can explain their infrequent use. Orogastric lavage can be useful for early lethal ingestions, albeit with significant complications such as aspiration and perforation. Activated charcoal cannot adsorb every substance. Usual dosing is 1 g/kg per dose. Whole-bowel irrigation is reserved for charged molecules or substances not adsorbed to activated charcoal but requires intact gut motility. Indications depend on several factors inherent to the ingestion (dose, time, poison) and patient's characteristics. During recent decades, studies of newer pharmaceuticals or modified-release formulations showed that significant amounts of poison, especially pharmacobezoars, persist in the gut hours postingestion, thus are amenable to gastrointestinal decontamination. Improved understanding of gut motility in volunteer studies and overdose showed clinically significant reduction in drug exposure with activated charcoal. The 1-h dogma for gastrointestinal decontamination, especially activated charcoal, is now obsolete. Clinicians must perform a risk assessment for each ingestion to determine the expected benefit at the time of decision-making, choosing the modality to achieve reduction in the toxicity burden while planning for complications or contraindications."

The Diagnosis Grouping System (DGS) was developed to classify International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision diagnosis codes for pediatric emergency department (ED) encounters. We applied and compared the DGS to large samples of US ED encounters for children using 3 large health system databases. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study of children (younger than age 18 years) between 2016 and 2021 using 3 ED datasets: the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS; a complex survey of US ED encounters), COMPdata (a dataset of encounters for Illinois), and the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS; an administrative database of US children's hospitals). We categorized principal diagnoses using the DGS and compared their distribution. We included 181 607 978 survey-weighted encounters from NHAMCS, 5 352 016 encounters from COMPdata, and 20 859 019 encounters from PHIS. A higher proportion of encounters in the PHIS sample were admitted or transferred (12.7%) compared with those in the NHAMCS (6.1%) or COMPdata (4.2%) samples. Trauma was the most common major group identified among all datasets (22.0% in NHAMCS, 22.2% in COMPdata, and 17.0% in PHIS). Some conditions, such as sickle cell anemia, diabetes mellitus, appendicitis, seizures, and asthma, presented more frequently among children presenting to the PHIS hospitals. We identified comparable diagnostic distributions across different datasets, with differences that are likely attributable to specific characteristics of the data source. Our findings provide a baseline for pediatric diagnoses to facilitate future research on pediatric ED utilization."

This subgroup analysis examined the efficacy and safety of daprodustat versus darbepoetin alfa in patients with anemia of CKD undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). ASCEND-D (NCT02879305) was an open-label, Phase 3 trial; patients with CKD were randomized to daprodustat daily and epoetin alfa (HD patients) or darbepoetin alfa (PD patients). In PD patients, prespecified analyses of the co-primary endpoints of mean change in hemoglobin from baseline to Weeks 28-52 using an ANOVA model and first occurrence of a major cardiovascular event (MACE) using a Cox proportional hazards model were conducted. The secondary endpoints were average monthly intravenous iron dose to Week 52 and treatment-emergent adverse events. Additional post hoc analyses were conducted. Overall, 340 PD patients (daprodustat n = 171, darbepoetin alfa n = 169) were randomized. Mean age was 53.6 years (±14 SD), 55% male, 56% White. For daprodustat and darbepoetin alfa groups respectively, mean change in hemoglobin was 0.38 and 0.23 g/dL [adjusted mean difference 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.04, 0.34], and first occurrence of adjudicated MACE occurred in 40 (23.4%) and 46 (27.2%) patients (HR 0.84; 95% CI, 0.55-1.28). No heterogeneity was observed between PD and HD patients for these endpoints in ASCEND-D. Serum hepcidin was lower with daprodustat; there was no difference in other iron parameters, intravenous iron usage, transfusion requirement, blood pressure, or quality of life. There were no differences in adverse events or incidence of peritonitis between the groups.

Physical examination showed guarding and rebound in the right lower quadrant. The patient, who had leukocytosis in the investigations, showed signs of acute appendicitis and a 5 cm right adrenal mass on the abdominal computed tomography. A previous abdominal magnetic resonance imaging by the endocrinology department six months ago revealed a 39x32 mm mass in the right adrenal gland and elevated urinary catecholamine levels. It was learned that the patient had not attended follow-up appointments during this period. The patient was consulted by endocrinology and an emergency laparoscopic appendectomy was performed. The patient, discharged on the 2nd day after surgery, did not experience any complications. The patient was referred to endocrinology, and preoperative preparations for pheochromocytoma surgery were initiated. In cases of emergency in patients diagnosed with pheochromocytoma emergency surgery can be performed with appropriate preoperative preparation."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is one of the most common causes of an acute abdomen among pediatric patients. The diagnosis of appendicitis is challenging due to the nonspecific presentation. Diagnosis is based on historical, physical, and serologic information as well as right lower quadrant ultrasound (RLQ US). In equivocal patients, or those with a high degree of suspicion, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous (IV) contrast can be utilized to rule in appendicitis. However, optimizing diagnostic protocols to minimize ionizing radiation exposure while maintaining diagnostic accuracy is important. We performed a monthly retrospective analysis of CT usage among pediatric patients with suspected acute appendicitis presenting to the pediatric emergency department (ED) from June 2023 to December 2023. We used quality improvement methodology to decrease CT use with monthly Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles with an aim to decrease CT use by 50%. The main intervention was coordination between the ED and surgical providers to require surgical consult before ordering a CT. We quantified the number of patients who received a surgical consult before CT, the number of RLQ US performed, the number of CTs performed, and the number of appendectomies, specifically the number with perforation. A total of 249 patients under 18 years of age presented to the pediatric ED with symptoms of acute appendicitis during the study period. All 249 patients underwent an initial RLQ US. The number of CTs performed decreased from a baseline of 14 in June to a nadir of four in September (71% decrease, p=0.029). There was a decrease in the percentage of patients who underwent a CT scan after an RLQ US from 36.5% in June to 11.8% in September after our intervention. In June, a total of 38 RLQ US were performed and 14 patients underwent additional CT (36.5%) and in September a total of 34 US were performed and 14 patients underwent additional CT (11.8%). There was an increase in the surgical consults rate from a baseline of seven surgical consults with 14 total CTs in June 2023 (50%) to seven consults with a total of seven CTs performed (100%) in December 2023. There was no increase in appendiceal perforation rates. Multidisciplinary discussions between pediatric ED physicians and pediatric surgeons reduced CT usage, and corresponding radiation exposure and cost, in the evaluation of appendicitis."

This case report outlines the presentation, diagnosis, management, and outcomes of a 71-year-old male patient who experienced iatrogenic rectal perforation during the routine insertion of a Foley catheter, against the backdrop of several predisposing factors, such as atrial fibrillation, valvular disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, urethral stenosis, and colorectal cancer with liver metastasis. The inadvertent creation of a rectourethral fistula during the procedure led to an urgent multidisciplinary approach involving surgery and postoperative management, including fecal and urine diversion and antibiotic therapy. The case highlights the critical importance of meticulous technique and comprehensive preoperative patient assessment in minimizing the risk of such iatrogenic complications. It further discusses the management strategies for rectourethral fistulas, ranging from conservative approaches to surgical interventions, and emphasizes the role of fecal diversion, urine diversion, and the potential of robotic surgery in enhancing outcomes for complex cases. The report concludes by reflecting on the intricate balance between routine medical procedures and the potential for severe complications, highlighting the need for heightened awareness and skill in the prevention and management of iatrogenic rectal perforation."

    "abstract": "We applied three electronic triggers to study frequency and contributory factors of missed opportunities for improving diagnosis (MOIDs) in pediatric emergency departments (EDs): return visits within 10 days resulting in admission (Trigger 1), care escalation within 24 h of ED presentation (Trigger 2), and death within 24 h of ED visit (Trigger 3). We created an electronic query and reporting template for the triggers and applied them to electronic health record systems of five pediatric EDs for visits from 2019. Clinician reviewers manually screened identified charts and initially categorized them as \"unlikely for MOIDs\" or \"unable to rule out MOIDs\" without a detailed chart review. For the latter category, reviewers performed a detailed chart review using the Revised Safer Dx Instrument to determine the presence of a MOID. A total of 2937 ED records met trigger criteria (Trigger 1 1996 [68%], Trigger 2 829 [28%], Trigger 3 112 [4%]), of which 2786 (95%) were categorized as unlikely for MOIDs. The Revised Safer Dx Instrument was applied to 151 (5%) records and 76 (50%) had MOIDs. The overall frequency of MOIDs was 2.6% for the entire cohort, 3.0% for Trigger 1, 1.9% for Trigger 2, and 0% for Trigger 3. Brain lesions, infections, or hemorrhage; pneumonias and lung abscess; and appendicitis were the top three missed diagnoses. The majority (54%) of MOIDs cases resulted in patient harm. Contributory factors were related to patient-provider (52.6%), followed by patient factors (21.1%), system factors (13.2%), and provider factors (10.5%). Using electronic triggers with selective record review is an effective process to screen for harmful diagnostic errors in EDs: detailed review of 5% of charts revealed MOIDs in half, of which half were harmful to the patient. With further refining, triggers can be used as effective patient safety tools to monitor diagnostic quality."

    "abstract": "Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) harbors the risk of periprocedural complications that require emergent cardiac surgery, or \"surgical bailout.\" Surgical bailout intends to be lifesaving but is associated with high mortality. This has given rise to discussion on the necessity of surgical backup during TAVR. Therefore, recent studies in contemporary TAVR patients are warranted. This study aimed to assess the incidence, trends, and clinical outcomes of surgical bailout in patients undergoing transfemoral TAVR. The CENTER2 (Cerebrovascular Events in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation With Balloon-Expandable Valves Versus Self-Expandable Valves 2) study contains patient-level data from 10 clinical studies with patients undergoing TAVR between 2007 and 2022. A total of 24,010 patients undergoing transfemoral TAVR were included. The mean age was 81.5 ± 6.7 years, and 56% were female. The median Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality declined over time (2007-2014: 7.1% [Q1-Q3: 4.3%-14.8%] vs 2015-2022: 3.9% [Q1-Q3: 2.6%-6.0%]; P < 0.001). Surgical bailout was reported in 125 (0.52%) patients, and its incidence decreased over time, from 0.84% in 2007 to 2010 to 0.25% in 2019 to 2022 (Ptrend < 0.001). Surgical bailout was more frequently observed in women compared with men (0.61% vs 0.41%; P = 0.03). Ventricular perforation was the most prevalent reason for surgical bailout (28.0%). Patients who underwent surgical bailout reported higher mortality rates during the 1-year follow-up compared with patients without surgical bailout (68.3% vs 15.3%; HR: 8.60; 95% CI: 6.74-10.97; P < 0.001). Interestingly, patients surviving the first 90 days reported a similar mortality risk (HR: 2.19; 95% CI: 0.91-5.27; P = 0.08). The incidence of surgical bailout is very low in the contemporary TAVR population. Mortality rates remain high among patients requiring surgical bailout during transfemoral TAVR, but this risk diminishes in patients surviving the postprocedural period.

    "abstract": "Limited data exist on the role neighborhood-level social determinants of health (SDOH) play in health care utilization in pediatric patients with common, nonelective surgical conditions. We aimed to test the hypothesis that lower neighborhood-level SDOH are associated with increased health care utilization in pediatric acute uncomplicated appendicitis (AUA) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. This retrospective cohort study included patients aged younger than 19 years, hospitalized through emergency departments, and diagnosed with AUA. Discharge data from January 1, 2017, through February 28, 2022, were obtained from 28 hospitals in the Pediatric Health Information System database. Childhood Opportunity Index (COI) was used as an estimate of neighborhood-level SDOH. Logistic regression with generalized estimating equations assessed for association of COI level with prolonged length of stay (PLOS, defined as ≥2 SD above mean LOS) and/or a related 30-day return visit. We identified 37 670 children with AUA. We found that 2678 (7.1%) had PLOS, 1340 (3.6%) had related 30-day return visits, and 241 (0.6%) had both outcomes. After adjusting for sex, age, overweight/obesity, and pre-/intra-COVID-19 pandemic time frames, children with very low COI levels were 70% more likely to have PLOS (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.70; CI, 1.2-2.37), 27% more likely to have related 30-day return visits (aOR, 1.27; CI, 1.04-1.53), and 64% more likely to have both (aOR, 1.64; CI, 1.11-2.44) compared with those with a very high COI level. In pediatric patients presenting with AUA, a very low COI level was associated with increased health care utilization. Further research is needed to identify contributing factors and develop strategies to mitigate disparities."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis in pregnancy is the most common non-obstetric surgical condition which requires urgent evaluation and immediate intervention in a multidisciplinary approach. Pregnancy anatomical and physiological changes can mask the presentation of appendicitis and poses both diagnostic and management challenges. A 32 year old female, G3P2L2 at gestation age of 11 weeks by USS, presented with recurrent episodes of acute abdominal pain for one day, afebrile but accompanied with poor appetite, nausea and vomiting along episodes of per vaginal spotting which started three days prior. She was initially diagnosed and treated as a threatened abortion case with no improvement of symptoms. Abdominal pain was refractory to analgesics. Abdominal pelvic USS was done twice and revealed no features of appendicitis while obstetric USS was unremarkable. Clinical examination revealed an Alvarado score of 7. A diagnostic laparoscopy confirmed acute perforated appendicitis and she underwent laparoscopic appendectomy with uneventful post-operative recovery. Acute appendicitis is challenging to diagnose and manage during pregnancy due to symptoms overlapping with maternal physiological and anatomical changes along with obstetric presentations like threatened abortion. Appendicitis scoring systems like the Alvarado score are still reliable diagnostic tools even during pregnancy while the use of preferred imaging like USS is more limited secondary to gravid uterus. All pregnant women with acute abdomen pain and suspecting features of acute appendicitis should be screened thoroughly for the condition. Diagnostic laparoscopy is useful and friendly in diagnosis and management in pregnancy. Multidisciplinary approach in evaluating and managing such cases in pregnancy is of high clinical benefits for maternal-fetal outcomes."

    "abstract": "Catheter ablation procedure for symptomatic atrial fibrillation is an established treatment. Cardiac tamponade is one of the several complications associated with atrial fibrillation ablation. We present the case of a 60-year-old male with a past medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypotension on midodrine, atrial fibrillation status post-ablation a week prior, and a cerebrovascular accident who presented to the emergency department with complaints of weakness, nausea, vomiting, confusion and some syncopal episodes for the past few days. He denied chest pain, dyspnea, and a history of alcohol use. On arrival at the emergency department, the patient was hypotensive and tachycardic. Laboratory evaluation revealed elevated liver enzymes and troponins. The electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray showed low lung volumes with a left retrocardiac opacity and cardiomegaly. Given the patient's hypotension requiring vasopressor support, elevated troponins, and a recent cardiac procedure, an echocardiogram was done, and it revealed a large posterior pericardial effusion adjacent to the left ventricle. Tamponade was suspected and the patient was taken for an emergent pericardial window. Intraoperatively, a perforation of the right ventricle was found with a large area of surrounding necrotic and ischemic tissue. There was a significant hemorrhage with the opening of the pericardium, which could not be controlled due to the large area of non-viable cardiac tissue. The patient went into cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity. Open cardiac massage was performed but the return of spontaneous circulation could not be achieved and the patient was declared deceased. Pericardial effusion with tamponade is the complication of cardiac ablation associated with the highest mortality. An echocardiogram is a fast and reliable way to confirm the diagnosis of a tamponade. Delayed cardiac tamponade should always remain a differential diagnosis when a patient has recently undergone an ablation procedure given the potential fatality."

    "abstract": "The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, coupled with the limited effectiveness of existing antibiotics in eradicating biofilms, presents a significant threat to global health care. This critical situation underscores the urgent need for the discovery and development of antimicrobial agents. Recently, peptide-derived antimicrobial nanomaterials have shown promise in combating such infections. Amino acid noncovalent forces, notably π-π stacking and electrostatic interactions, remain underutilized for guiding the coassembly of peptides into bacteriostatic nanomaterials. Thus, we constructed a dimeric nanopeptide system using the disulfide bonds of cysteine. The self-assembly of dimeric peptides into nanofibers was realized by the interaction of π-π aromatic amino acids (Trp, Phe, and Pyr) and the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged amino acids (Asp and Arg). The optimal dimeric peptide 2D2W exhibits potent antibacterial activity against resistant bacteria and is nontoxic. Mechanistically, 2D2W penetrated the outer membrane after electrostatic adsorption, resulting in plasma membrane depolarization, homeostatic disruption, and ultimately bacterial death. In a mouse model of peritonitis, 2D2W demonstrated efficacy in the in vivo treatment of bacterial infections. In conclusion, the design of dimeric nanopeptides co-driven by intermolecular forces provides a promising avenue for the development of high-performance antimicrobial nanomaterials. These advances may also facilitate the application and advancement of peptide-based bacteriostatic agents in clinical practice."

    "abstract": "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is a common surgical treatment for morbid obesity, but rare complications involving the excluded gastric remnant can pose significant challenges. A 65-year-old female with a history of RYGB presented with sudden onset of left upper quadrant abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, and loss of appetite. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis. An initial CT scan showed significant distention of the excluded stomach, suggesting possible obstruction. While preparing for percutaneous decompression, her abdominal pain worsened acutely. A repeat CT scan demonstrated decompression of the excluded stomach and new free fluid in the abdomen, indicating a perforation. Emergent exploratory laparotomy uncovered a large necrotic perforation in the excluded gastric remnant and extensive adhesions from prior surgeries. A partial gastrectomy and antrectomy were performed to remove the perforated tissue. Pathological examination revealed ulcerated gastric mucosa with acute and chronic inflammation, reactive gastropathy, and no evidence of Helicobacter pylori infection or malignancy. Postoperatively, the patient recovered well with supportive care and was discharged home. Diagnosing complications in the excluded stomach after RYGB is challenging due to altered anatomy and nonspecific symptoms. Maintaining a high index of suspicion is essential when evaluating post-RYGB patients with unexplained abdominal pain. Early recognition and prompt surgical intervention are critical for favorable outcomes in these patients."

    "title": "Gall Stone Ileus and Recurrence: Management Dilemma for the Operating Surgeon.",
    "abstract": "Gallstone ileus (GSI) is a rare complication of gallstone disease. It occurs as a result of the passage of a stone from the biliary tract into the gastrointestinal tract via an abnormal pathway (bilio-enteric fistula). Chronic inflammatory processes result in gall bladder adhering and subsequently eroding into the intestines, leading to a fistula. It is a surgical emergency seen in the elderly who often present as being unwell, with abdominal pain, distension, and vomiting. Imaging such as a CT scan is diagnostic in confirming small bowel obstruction. Management usually involves relief of obstruction by removing the impacted gallstone. Despite surgical intervention, a small proportion of patients develop recurrent symptoms or recurrent gallstone ileus, usually within a few weeks of initial presentation. The recurrence of symptoms during index admission is extremely rare and can be challenging to diagnose and manage. The morbidity and mortality remain high in elderly patients. We report an 89-year-old patient who presented with small bowel obstruction. The CT scan confirmed gallstone ileus as a result of a stone impacted in the mid-small bowel. The patient had a laparotomy with extraction of the stone. No migrating stones were felt proximally. Five days postoperatively, he developed recurrent gallstone ileus confirmed on a CT scan and had to undergo another surgery to relieve the obstruction. We aim to investigate various management strategies for recurrent gallstone ileus, ranging from the commonly practiced approach of simple stone extraction to more definitive surgical interventions, including fistula repair, which may provide a more comprehensive solution."

    "abstract": "The persistence of fetal vitelline structures may occur. The primary intestinal arterial supply development happens normally in this scenario, but a vitelline vascular remnant (VVR) persists. A 13-year-old boy with a history of severe and intermittent abdominal pain since early infancy presented to the Emergency Department with clinical, analytical, and ultrasonographic findings suggestive of acute appendicitis. There was no evidence of intestinal obstruction. Surgical treatment was indicated. A thick fibrovascular band from the umbilicus to the terminal ileum's mesentery was identified during laparoscopy. A gangrenous cecal appendix was also identified. A regular appendectomy and surgical excision of the band was performed. The histopathological study confirmed that it was a persistent right vitelline artery (VVR) and that the patient had acute gangrenous appendicitis. The patient evolved favorably and is currently asymptomatic and under follow-up. The literature on VVR is scarce. The present manuscript reviews the main characteristics of this embryological insult based on the preceding literature. Standardization of terminology regarding VVR will help better understand this pathology in the future."

    "abstract": "Perioperative metabolic acidosis negatively affects patient outcomes. Perioperative fluid therapy has a clinically significant effect on acid-base balance. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of isotonic sodium bicarbonate infusion (ISB) versus balanced crystalloid solution (BCS) on perioperative acid-base balance, in terms of postoperative base excess, among patients undergoing emergency laparotomy for perforation peritonitis. This prospective, randomized, single-center, double-blinded study was conducted in a tertiary hospital from October 2021 to November 2022. A total of 90 patients undergoing emergency laparotomy for perforation peritonitis were randomly assigned to receive either isotonic sodium bicarbonate (ISB) or Ringer's Lactate as a balanced crystalloid solution (BCS) for perioperative maintenance fluid therapy. The primary outcome was to compare the base excess (BE) at the end of surgery. The secondary outcomes were to compare the postoperative clinical outcomes, including the requirement of vasopressors, duration of mechanical ventilation, HDU/ICU stay, the incidence of AKI within seven days, the incidence of re-exploration, and in-hospital mortality. Additionally, pH, PaCO2, HCO3, BE, and lactates intraoperatively and up to 24 h postoperatively were also compared. The median base excess (BE) values at the end of surgery were significantly better in the ISB group - 4.80 [- 6.80, - 4.10] as compared to the BCS group - 7.30 [- 8.50, - 6.30]. The ISB group had a lower incidence of postoperative AKI (9% ISB versus 24% BCS) and requirement of vasopressors (18% ISB versus 44% BCS). However, there was no major difference between the incidence of re-exploration, length of ICU/HDU stay, and in-hospital mortality. Infusing isotonic sodium bicarbonate (ISB) for intraoperative maintenance fluid therapy in patients undergoing emergency laparotomy for perforation peritonitis significantly improves perioperative acid-base balance with better postoperative clinical outcomes compared to a balanced crystalloid solution (BCS)."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Crohn disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease known for causing fistulous tracts, abscesses, and bowel perforation. Enterohepatic fistulas, a rare but significant complication, are scarcely reported. This article presents the case of a hepatic abscess due to an enterohepatic fistula in a patient with long-term Crohn disease and reviews the existing literature on this phenomenon. CASE REPORT A 59-year-old female patient with a known history of Crohn disease and previous ileocolic resection due to enteroenteric fistulas presented to our Emergency Department with right-sided abdominal pain persisting for 10 days. Diagnostic investigations, including imaging, revealed an enterohepatic fistula with a 3-4 cm hepatic abscess in segment V of the liver. Initial management involved conservative treatment with radiological drainage and antibiotics, leading to the patient's discharge. An elective laparotomy was scheduled 1 month later. The patient underwent resection of the ileocolic anastomosis with ileotransverse re-anastomosis and catheter removal. Postoperative management included treatment for paralytic ileus. She was discharged in good condition on postoperative day 11. CONCLUSIONS This report highlights the range of complications that can occur in patients with Crohn disease and presents the rare association between Crohn disease and enterohepatic fistula and abscess formation. Only 2 other case reports of enterohepatic fistula due to Crohn disease exist in the literature. Given the scarcity of evidence, no standardized guidelines are available, necessitating an individualized treatment approach. Initial conservative management can be effective; however, close monitoring is crucial to determine the need for subsequent surgical intervention."

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer worldwide and the second most common cause of cancer death. About 20% of patients diagnosed with rectal cancer present with emergency symptoms. Typical symptoms include acute bleeding, obstruction, and perforation. These emergency situations can be life-threatening and may lead to decreased life expectancy and quality of life. Bowel perforation is the most common cause of emergency presentation, followed by obstruction and acute bleeding. This narrative review analyzes the existing literature regarding the acute presentation of rectal cancer, producing three flow charts for the management of the main rectal emergencies. The treatment of acute bleeding differs based on the hemodynamic status. Treatment for bowel perforation or occlusion differs depending on whether the lesion is intraperitoneal or extraperitoneal. Emergency presentations seem to be strongly associated with several poor prognostic factors, including lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, and high-grade or poorly differentiated tumors. An association between emergency presentation and larger tumor size, advanced tumor stage, node-positive disease, and metastatic disease is reported in the literature. The difference between colon and rectal cancer, both in terms of treatment and prognosis, has been widely acknowledged. Thus, comprehensive studies and dedicated guidelines are needed, considering the lack of literature published about rectal cancer in an emergency setting."

    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Sarcopenia and frailty are both multidimensional and interrelated problems for patients with cirrhosis and require prompt assessment and appropriate management because of their impact on disease outcomes. Our purpose is to identify the prevalence of sarcopenia and frailty in patients with advanced liver disease. Furtherksdnvk more, our purpose is to explore the association between sarcopenia, frailty, and various complications and the impact of these conditions on short- and long-term hospital survival rates. Methods: A prospective, observational, unicentric study was conducted in an emergency university hospital in Romania between January 2021 and December 2023 that included patients with advanced liver diseases. The patients with sarcopenia and frailty were selected using measurements of handgrip strength (HGS), Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), liver frailty index (LFI), and skeletal muscle index (SMI). Patients were divided into four groups based on the presence of sarcopenia and/or frailty. Results: This study included 128 patients. Younger patients associated with both sarcopenia and frailty (55.76 ± 10.46 years). Most males were without sarcopenia and frailty (63.93%) compared to those with both sarcopenia and frailty (36.07%). The Child-Pugh score C was identified in the majority of those with both sarcopenia and frailty (69.70%). Higher values for MELD-Na scores were obtained in the group with sarcopenia and frailty (25.45 ± 6.924). Biomarkers like albumin, sodium, C-reactive protein, bilirubin, and platelets were statistically significant as mortality predictors in all four groups. Patients with both sarcopenia and frailty presented more often with encephalopathy and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Survival rates in the short and long term were lower for the patients who associated both sarcopenia and frailty compared to those without sarcopenia and frailty. Conclusions: The presence of sarcopenia and frailty significantly impacts outcomes in patients with decompensated advanced liver disease. When both conditions coexist in the same patient, they markedly increase in-hospital mortality, as well as short- and long-term survival rates."

    "abstract": "Penetrating cardiac trauma is an entity with high pre and intrahospital mortality due to complications such as cardiac tamponade and massive hemothorax. A ventricular septal defect (VSD) occurs in 1-5% of cases and can present early or late. The management strategy for VSD resulting from penetrating cardiac trauma is uncertain. A 19-year-old man was admitted in cardiorespiratory arrest after a precordial stab wound. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated achieving return of spontaneous circulation. eFAST evaluation revealed cardiac tamponade, he was taken to emergency left thoracotomy finding a perforation of the free wall of the left ventricle and a tear of the upper lobe of the left lung that were sutured. The patient was discharged and six days later was readmitted with fever and dyspnea. During treatment for a surgical site infection a new-onset pansystolic murmur was found: A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a 13-mm VSD with left-to-right shunt. A multidisciplinary team recommended percutaneous closure of the defect which was successfully performed without complications. Traumatic VSD is a rare complication of penetrating cardiac trauma. A thorough clinical and echocardiographic evaluation is essential for its diagnosis and characterization. Symptomatic septal defects, those 10 mm or larger, with Qp: Qs greater than 1.5, or causing complications such as pulmonary hypertension or valvular involvement, are usually closed to prevent progression of heart failure. Management of traumatic VSD has traditionally been surgical. However, a percutaneous intervention is a viable alternative in selected stable patients. Unlike ischemic VSD, early intervention after patient stabilization generally yields favorable outcomes."

Partial malrotation may have variable clinical presentations and this case highlights a constellation of patient history, radiographic signs, and operative findings leading to appropriate diagnosis and successful surgical management. A 56-year-old female patient presented with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and anorexia. She reported acute on chronic vague, intermittent cramping abdominal pain for approximately five months. Prior evaluations of her gastrointestinal symptoms did not reveal a clear etiology. On examination, the patient's vital signs were within normal limits and the abdominal exam was benign. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast, obtained in the emergency department, was concerning for paraduodenal hernia but was also notable for the lack of a duodenal sweep. With the severity of abdominal pain being out of proportion to the physical exam and the aforementioned radiographic findings, we decided to proceed with diagnostic laparoscopy. Intraoperative findings included a Ladd band forming a potential space for the incarceration of the bowel, internal herniation of the partially reducible small bowel, and a narrow mesenteric base. A laparoscopic Ladd procedure was performed and the patient recovered without complications. Her chronic gastrointestinal complaints have abated since the operative intervention. This case underscores the importance of considering a rare diagnosis such as partial malrotation of the gut in adults presenting with acute on chronic abdominal pain, the key clinical features associated with this pathology, and its successful operative management. Furthermore, this case highlights the importance of early recognition and management to minimize the morbidity and mortality of devastating sequelae such as midgut volvulus and closed-loop obstruction."

The occurrence of Amyand's hernia with testicular necrosis is particularly uncommon, further complicating its clinical presentation and management. A 50-year-old male presented with a two-year history of progressive right scrotal swelling, acutely worsened over four days with pain and fever. Examination revealed a firm, tender, irreducible right scrotal mass with overlying erythema. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis. Imaging confirmed an inflamed appendix within the hernial sac, consistent with Amyand's hernia complicated by abscess formation. Emergency surgery revealed a gangrenous appendix, scrotal abscess, and necrotic right testicular tissue. The patient underwent appendectomy, orchiectomy, hernia repair, and abscess drainage. He recovered uneventfully, with symptom resolution and no recurrence at follow-up. The progression of Amyand's hernia to appendicitis and subsequent perforation, as seen in our case, can result in severe complications, including abscess formation and testicular necrosis. The Losanoff and Basson classification categorizes Amyand's hernia based on the appendix's condition and associated complications, ranging from a normal appendix (Type 1) to severe extra-sac pathology such as gangrene or malignancy (Type 4). Our case aligns with Type 4, involving a perforated appendix with gangrene and a scrotal abscess, necessitating extensive surgical intervention. This case highlights the rarity and complexity of Amyand's hernia in adults, emphasizing the need for prompt recognition and tailored management to achieve favorable outcomes."

Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive review and analysis of the clinical manifestations, immunohistological characteristics, and prognostic factors associated with small intestinal sarcomatoid carcinoma, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic strategies for this rare malignancy. An 82-year-old man was admitted with a 1-week history of abdominal pain, exacerbated by the onset of fever in the last 24 hours. Abdominal CT revealed thickening of the small intestinal wall and free gas within the mesenteric space, indicating gastrointestinal perforation. Emergency surgery identified multiple tumors in the small intestine, accompanied by perforation. Postoperative pathology confirmed the diagnosis of sarcomatoid carcinoma of the small intestine. We report a rare case of sarcomatoid carcinoma of the small intestine and conduct a thorough literature review to offer new insights into its diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. This highly malignant tumor, predominantly found in the jejunum and ileum, is characterized by high recurrence and metastasis rates, leading to a poor prognosis. Notably, postoperative radiotherapy does not improve outcomes. Abdominal CT is highly sensitive for detecting small bowel tumors but cannot confirm SCA due to its nonspecific imaging features. In contrast, small enteroscopy or capsule endoscopy offers greater diagnostic clarity. Increased awareness among clinicians is crucial for early detection and intervention."

    "abstract": "We report a rare case of a 90-year-old woman with Stage IV lung cancer awaiting transfer to hospice care who developed sudden abdominal and knee skin mottling. Elevated inflammatory markers on blood tests and emergent computed tomography led to a diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia, and the patient passed away 7 h later. Skin mottling indicates decreased blood flow in the gastrointestinal tract and is observed during mesenteric ischemia. Abdominal skin mottling may serve as an important physical finding that is detected early and suggests circulatory failure and intestinal ischemia."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and clinicopathological correlates of intestinal endometriosis, amongst other extra-pelvic endometriosis foci, presenting as bowel obstruction in general surgery practice. A total of 23 female patients (mean ± SD age: 34.9 ± 6.5 years) who underwent abdominal surgery for acute bowel obstruction and received histopathological diagnosis of endometriosis were included in this retrospective case-series study. Data on patient characteristics, obstetric history, preoperative laboratory and imaging findings, preoperative provisional diagnosis, type of surgical intervention and the pathological diagnosis, and postoperative outcomes were recorded. Definitive diagnoses on histopathological work-up involved intestinal endometriosis (52.2%), scar endometriosis (26.0%), ovarian endometriosis (13.0%) and inguinal endometriosis (8.7%). Postoperative complication, reoperation and recurrence rates were 8.7%, 8.7%, and 13.0%, respectively. Intestinal endometriosis, when compared to other extra-pelvic endometriosis foci (scar and inguinal), was associated with significantly higher preoperative platelet counts (332.0(284.0-528.0)vs. 239.0(223.0-370.0) 103/µL, p = 0.010), lower albumin levels (4.0(2.7-4.7) vs. 4.5(4.2-4.9) g/dL, p = 0.029), higher rates of preoperative CT utilization (91.7% vs. 0.0%, p < 0.001) and emergent surgery (83.3% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.001) and longer LOS (median 4.5 (1.0-26.0) vs. 1.0(1.0-1.0) days, p = 0.001) along with a non-significant tendency for higher postoperative complication (16.7% vs. 0.0%) and ICU stay (25.0% vs. 0.0%) rates. Our findings revealed intestinal endometriosis, predominantly in the terminal ileum/appendix, was the most common extra-pelvic cause of acute bowel obstruction. The scar endometriosis, inguinal endometriosis and ovarian endometriosis appeared to be other potential but less prevalent aetiologies in this setting."

    "abstract": "BackgroundEmergency appendicectomy (EA) is a common procedure, yet few studies have focused on gender differences in these patients. This study aims to evaluate the demographics, preoperative investigations, intraoperative findings, and clinical outcomes between males and females undergoing EA.MethodsA multicenter retrospective observational study was conducted across four hospitals involving patients who underwent EA between August 2018 and November 2025. Patients were identified through pathology records, and data were collected on demographics, preoperative blood tests, imaging, operative details, and clinical outcomes and results compared.Results1128 patients were included, with 57.5% being male. Males were younger (median age: 34 vs 40 years, P < .001). There was no significant difference in preoperative white cell or neutrophil counts, although males had lower C-reactive protein levels (median 72 vs 97, P < .001). Females were more likely to undergo pre-operative imaging, including ultrasound (20.7% vs 1.5%, P < .001) and CT scans (61.8% vs 54.9%, P = .020). Open surgery was more common in males (14% vs 6.5%, P < .001). No differences were observed in the severity of appendicitis, negative EA rates, hospital stay duration, postoperative complications, or 30-day readmission rates.ConclusionsAlthough differences exist between genders in terms of age, imaging usage, and surgical approach, clinical outcomes are comparable."

    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Small bowel obstruction (SBO) requires prompt diagnosis and management. Due to its advantages, POCUS can be beneficial when assessing SBO. However, it is still doubtful whether POCUS performed by an emergency doctor can prolong the time of patients with SBO in the emergency department (ED). The primary outcome was time to diagnosis when using POCUS compared to not using it. Secondary outcomes included the processing time in the ED, ED length of stay (LOS), rates of abdominal radiography, hospital LOS, and mortality. Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective, observational study in our ED from 1 November 2021 to 31 December 2023, including patients aged 18 and older diagnosed with SBO. Both groups received confirmation of their diagnosis through contrast-enhanced computed tomography. The two groups of patients (POCUS group vs. non-POCUS group) were compared regarding the time needed to reach the final diagnosis (i.e., time to diagnosis), the ED LOS, the hospital LOS, and in-hospital mortality. Results: A total of 106 patients were included. The median time to diagnosis was 121 min for the POCUS group vs. 217 min for the non-POCUS group (p < 0.001). Median ED processing time was 276 min in the POCUS group compared to 376 min in the non-POCUS group (p = 0.006). ED LOS was also shorter in the POCUS group (333 vs. 436 min, p = 0.010). Abdominal X-ray rates were lower in the POCUS group (49% vs. 78%, p = 0.004). Hospital LOS was similar between the two groups (p = 1.000). Five non-POCUS patients died during hospitalization; none died in the POCUS group, but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.063). Conclusions: POCUS significantly reduced time to diagnosis and ED LOS. Further exploration is needed to assess long-term outcomes and the cost-effectiveness of integrating POCUS into ED practice."

    "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex, multisystemic disease and is associated with ocular pathology in 4-12% of patients. In general, ocular disease affects Crohn's patients more frequently than those with ulcerative colitis. Episcleritis and uveitis are the most common presentations, with episcleritis often correlating with IBD flares, whereas uveitis presents independently of IBD activity and, in some cases, may even alert clinicians to a new diagnosis of IBD. Corneal EIMs encompass a range of pathologies, such as the common and benign keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye disease), which nevertheless causes significant patient discomfort, and the rarer condition of peripheral ulcerative keratitis, which warrants urgent review due to the risk of corneal perforation. Alongside EIMs, clinicians should also be aware of the iatrogenic consequences to the eye following treatment of IBD. Corticosteroids may cause cataracts, glaucoma, and-indirectly via hyperglycaemia-diabetic retinopathy. Methotrexate is irritating to ocular tissues and may cause conjunctivitis and blepharitis. Biologic medications, such as anti-TNFα agents, overlap in their use as treatment of both IBD and uveitis, and yet in some patients may also increase the risk of acute uveitis flares, as well as opportunistic, sight-threatening infections. With integrated care between gastroenterology and ophthalmology, patient outcomes can be improved by facilitating earlier detection and management of ocular disease. This narrative review summarises the ocular extraintestinal manifestations of IBD, including pathophysiology, epidemiology, and current treatment strategies."

    "title": "Mean Platelet Volume as an Emerging Biomarker for Diagnosing Acute Appendicitis: A Retrospective Study.",
    "abstract": "Introduction Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency that requires a timely and accurate diagnosis to prevent complications. Several laboratory markers have been assessed to improve the diagnostic accuracy of acute appendicitis, including C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell (WBC) count, and cytokines like interleukins and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. One less commonly used but potentially valuable marker is the mean platelet volume (MPV), which indicates the size of circulating platelets and has the potential to serve as a biomarker for inflammatory conditions. Methodology The study was designed as a retrospective analytical investigation to examine the role of MPV in diagnosing acute appendicitis. The retrospective design allowed the utilization of existing hospital data, ensuring that sufficient cases of acute appendicitis could be assessed without additional data collection. The calculation was based on statistical parameters, including the standard deviations from previous studies, critical values at a 5% significance level, and an 80% test power, arriving at a minimum required sample size of approximately 100 to ensure adequate statistical power for meaningful conclusions. Results The study found that patients with acute appendicitis had significantly higher MPV compared to the normal reference value of 8.9 fL. The average MPV in the patient group was 10.25 fL, which was statistically higher than the reference value (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the study revealed that MPV levels were even higher in patients with more severe forms of appendicitis, such as perforated or gangrenous appendicitis. The average MPV for the inflamed appendicitis group was 10.13 fL, while the average MPV for the perforated or gangrenous group was 11.26 fL, a statistically significant difference (P < 0.001). Conclusions The study demonstrates that MPV is a potentially valuable marker for diagnosing acute appendicitis and assessing its severity, particularly when used in combination with other biomarkers like neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and WBC count.  Elevated MPV in complicated cases of appendicitis, such as perforated or gangrenous appendicitis, suggests that MPV may aid in identifying high-risk patients who require urgent surgical intervention.  While MPV alone may not be as reliable as NLR in predicting appendicitis severity, its inclusion in a multi-biomarker approach could improve clinical decision-making."

    "abstract": "Pneumoperitoneum, or free air in the peritoneal cavity, typically indicates visceral organ perforation requiring urgent surgical intervention. In peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, however, it can occur without prior surgery or trauma, often due to technical errors, and may mimic peritonitis, risking misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment. We report a case of a 73-year-old male PD patient presenting with fever, abdominal pain, and bowel ileus, initially raising concerns for organ perforation due to pneumoperitoneum. A comprehensive diagnostic workup and history taking, including molecular testing, excluded infections and chemical causes such as icodextrin, drugs, bile, faeces, blood, and malignancy. The cause was traced to improper PD technique, specifically a lapse in the 'flush-before-fill' method. Conservative management and retraining led to full symptom resolution and disappearance of the free air. This case highlights the importance of thorough diagnostic evaluations to rule out serious causes of pneumoperitoneum in PD patients, emphasizing the role of proper PD technique and patient education in preventing complications. Pneumoperitoneum in PD patients can mimic peritonitis, posing a diagnostic challenge. Comprehensive evaluation and adherence to proper PD practices are essential to avoid unnecessary interventions."

During the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown slowed surgical processes, delaying medical consultations. To analyze the impact of the pandemic on the presentation and management of acute appendicitis. Retrospective cohort, which included patients under 15 years of age seen in the emergency department (ED) with a diagnosis of acute appendicitis, from March to December of the pre-pandemic period of 2018 and the pandemic period in 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, treatment, and complications were analyzed. Patients were divided into groups based on the severity of the condition. A statistically significant difference of p < 0.05 was demonstrated. 629 patients with AA from both periods were included. The evolution time from the onset of symptoms to the consultation of all patients with AA in the pandemic was longer, with 41.2 hours versus 35.5 hours in the pre-pandemic period (p < 0.05), and in the subgroup of complicated acute appendicitis (CAA), it was 59.5 hours versus 45.4 hours in the pandemic and pre-pandemic periods (p < 0.01), respectively.

The surgical approach in the pandemic was mainly laparoscopic with 62.4% (p < 0.001). During the pandemic, there was a delay in consultation and a greater requirement for intensive management in patients with acute appendicitis. The hospital stays and antibiotic treatment of appendiceal phlegmon were longer and the laparoscopic technique was the surgical approach of choice."

Multiple hypotheses are behind their coexistence, which include pathogen predilection, and mucosal ischemia inducing portal vein bacteremia as the management of uncomplicated acute cholecystitis and acute appendicitis is surgical, for which a single operation for synchronous presentation is effective. Here, we report a case with coexistent acute cholecystitis and acute appendicitis managed at our institution. A 30-year-old female presented with right upper quadrant abdominal pain for four days. The pain was radiating to the right shoulder, not related to fatty foods, associated with vomiting, anorexia, and burning micturition. On examination, she was vitally stable and afebrile with soft nondistended abdomen, a negative Murphy's sign, right lower quadrant rebound tenderness, and suprapubic tenderness. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis (17.59 × 109) and high ALT (40 IU/L) and AST (32.5 IU/L). Ultrasound showed a distended gallbladder with two echogenic intraluminal nonshadowing echogenicity, the largest measuring 0.57 cm. Due to the vague presentation we elected to go for computed tomography of the abdomen which showed a distended gallbladder with adjacent fat stranding, subhepatic appendix with distended tip and no surrounding fat stranding. She underwent diagnostic laparoscopy with cholecystectomy and appendectomy. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharge home on day 1.

Diagnosing these cases can be challenging, especially when pre-existing conditions are involved. Low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (LAMN) is a rare tumor of the appendix that can lead to pseudomyxoma peritonei. Herein, we present a case of ruptured LAMN following blunt abdominal trauma after a high-energy head-on collision, complicating the differentiation from other intraperitoneal injuries. A 42-year-old Japanese female was brought to our hospital following high-energy head-on collision. She presented with stable vital signs, complaining of anterior chest pain and abdominal tenderness without peritoneal irritation. Computed tomography scans indicated multiple fractures in her chest and complex fluid around the Douglas fossa extending to the ileocecal area, with a slightly dilated appendix tip. Despite stable vitals, emergency laparotomy was needed for suspected peritonitis and/or intraperitoneal hemorrhage. Emergency laparotomy revealed yellowish, jelly-like ascites and a ruptured appendiceal tumor. LAMN was suspected, and the appendix was completely resected, with cytoreductive surgery carefully performed. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of LAMN. Postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on Day 13 and referred for further LAMN management. This case report highlights the diagnostic difficulties of LAMN rupture following blunt abdominal trauma, stressing the need to consider rare conditions like LAMN in differential diagnoses of acute abdomen posttrauma."

    "abstract": "Diagnostic stewardship is the effort to optimize diagnostic testing to reduce errors while avoiding overtesting and overtreatment. Abdominal pain and appendicitis in children are essential use cases. Delayed diagnosis of appendicitis can be dangerous and even life-threatening, but overtesting is harmful. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children aged 5-17 years presenting with abdominal pain to 26 EDs within the Michigan Emergency Department Improvement Collaborative (MEDIC) from May 1, 2016, to February 29, 2024. We defined two outcome measures summarized by ED. First, we describe the cross-sectional imaging:appendicitis visits ratio, defined as the count of ED visits resulting in any cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI) divided by the count of ED visits with a diagnosis of appendicitis. Second, we describe the delayed diagnosis rate, defined by an ED visit for abdominal pain resulting in a discharge and subsequent return visit with a diagnosis of appendicitis within 7 days. The sample included 120,112 pediatric visits for abdominal pain at 26 EDs; 4967 (4.1%) were diagnosed with appendicitis. The cross-sectional imaging:appendicitis visits ratio varied by site, from as low as 0.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.1-0.2) at a pediatric site to as high as 7.9 (95% CI 4.8-16.4) at an urban ED. The proportion of pediatric ED visits for abdominal pain that resulted in an identified delayed diagnosis of appendicitis was 0.1% (141/120,112). All but four sites had fewer than 10 cases of delayed diagnosis across the study period. In this retrospective cohort study of 120,000+ ED visits for pediatric abdominal pain, we found that the ratio of visits with cross-sectional imaging to diagnosed cases of appendicitis varied widely across EDs. Delayed diagnosis of appendicitis was uncommon. Adherence to best practices and improved imaging quality may hold promise to improve diagnostic stewardship for children with abdominal pain across EDs."

Abdominal ultrasound showed a heterogeneous lesion in the left iliac fossa measuring 5 cm × 3.5 cm × 4 cm with no internal vascularity. Abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) demonstrated a hypodense lesion located left of the midline of the abdomen, which was inseparable from the small bowel at the antimesenteric border. Laparoscopic exploration was performed, and an intraoperative diagnosis of perforated Meckel's diverticulum with phlegmon formation was made. The patient had an uneventful recovery. Radiologists should be aware of the possibility of complicated Merkel's diverticulum when encountering cases of acute abdominal pain.

    "abstract": "Marginal ulcers are a common complication following Roux-en-Y bypass surgeries with an approximate incidence of 4.6%. The pathophysiology is complex and risk factors include smoking, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) use, Helicobacter pylori infection, and a larger pouch size. The management is usually medical encompassing control of modifiable risk factors and the administration of acid-reducing medications with data pointing towards faster healing time by using open capsule proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Emergent surgical management is indicated for complication such as fistula formation, perforation, stricture, or intractable bleeding. Multiple surgical approaches have been proposed in the past, including: resection of the gastrojejunal (GJ) junction, revision of the bypass and total gastrectomy for recurrent ulcers. We present a unique case of a complicated recurrent marginal ulcer after Roux-en-Y surgery in a patient with multiple surgical revisions that healed completely after placing a celiac artery stent for severe celiac artery stenosis. Our case highlights an association between ischemia and marginal ulcers. This association has been previously theorized, however, there is scarce evidence to support this theory. Our case not only supports this belief but also introduces a novel and potential alternative treatment for resistant marginal ulcers that have failed medical therapy. Our approach hypothesizes that addressing ischemia as the culprit for recurrent marginal ulcers in high-risk populations, might be a minimally invasive, yet successful method for treatment."

However, bowel perforation following SEMS placement remains a significant concern, as it can adversely affect oncological outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the recurrence and overall survival rates associated with SEMS-related bowel perforations. This multicenter, retrospective analysis included patients with obstructive colorectal cancer who underwent SEMS placement as a bridge to surgery. The data collection period spanned from January 2008 to May 2019, with patient matching in a 1:5 ratio based on age, sex, tumor location, pathological stage, and achievement of curative resection. Among the 412 patients who received SEMS placement, 25 (6.1%) patients experienced SEMS-related perforations (perforation group), with 21 instances classified as overt and four as silent perforations. Compared with 125 matched controls (non-perforation group), the perforation group showed elevated rates of emergent surgery, open surgery, and stoma formation, as well as a reduced interval from SEMS placement to surgery. The 5-year recurrence rate was notably higher in the perforation group than in the no-perforation group (47.4% vs. 21.5%, p < 0.001), whereas the 5-year survival rate was not significantly different between groups (63.8% vs. 80.0%, p = 0.330). SEMS-related perforation led to less favorable surgical outcomes and a higher rate of recurrence, although no notable impact on overall survival was observed. Considering the risk of perforation, these findings support the cautious use of SEMS as a bridge to surgery."

A retrospective cohort study, including all patients younger than 18 years who were diagnosed with small bowel duplications from 2013 until 2024 in a single tertiary medical center, was performed. Patients' demographics, duplication size and location, pathological results, and clinical outcomes were collected. Sixteen patients (nine boys, seven girls) underwent laparoscopic-assisted resection of small bowel duplication at an average age of 3 years. A prenatal diagnosis was made in 11 patients, 10 (91%) of whom underwent elective surgery at a median age of 1.3 years. Overall, six patients required semi-elective or urgent surgery due to bowel obstruction, abdominal discomfort, or symptomatic anemia, with most (83%) lacking prenatal evaluation. Elective surgery patients had significantly smaller duplications (13 cm3 vs. 135 cm3). Post-operative recovery was satisfactory in all patients, with an average hospital stay of 6 days. In conclusion, asymptomatic, small duplication cysts in the small bowel of pediatric patients can be managed expectantly and can be operated after the first year of age. This approach is safe and allows for laparoscopic exploration in older infants, yielding satisfactory outcomes."

The same day, she returned to the emergency department with complaints of neck and left-sided chest pain. Further evaluation revealed an esophageal perforation. It was managed conservatively, with the use of antibiotics and nil-by-mouth placement. This case demonstrates that depending on the size of the defect, conservative approaches of management are a reasonable option and that not all cases will necessitate an emergent surgery."

This case adds to the scientific literature by highlighting the potential risk of common fruits, such as grapes, in causing serious gastrointestinal blockages in pediatric patients, which is an uncommon but important consideration for pediatricians and caregivers. A 7-month-old female presented with a 3-day history of vomiting, which progressed to bilious vomiting, accompanied by abdominal distension and dehydration. Abdominal CT imaging revealed dilated small bowel loops and a spherical low-density lesion suggestive of an obstructing foreign body. The diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction due to a foreign body was confirmed intraoperatively. The obstructing object was identified as a whole Shine-Muscat grape. Surgical management involved a minimally invasive laparoscopic approach to crush and move the grape into the colon, avoiding bowel incision. The patient recovered well postoperatively and passed the grape fragments naturally, resuming a normal diet within days. This case underscores the importance of considering fruit ingestion as a potential cause of intestinal obstruction in infants. Pediatric surgeons and emergency clinicians should be aware of this rare but significant risk and employ careful history-taking, appropriate imaging, and minimally invasive techniques to manage such cases effectively."

    "title": "Successful Re-ileostomy Using Skin Flap Formation Techniques.",
    "abstract": "A 61-year-old woman underwent an emergent operation with sigmoid colon cancer resection, colostomy, and ileostomy on colon perforation. The low ileostoma, caused by intra-abdominal bad conditions, had irritated the surrounding skin after surgery, intermittently forcing the patient to fast for a certain period. Six months after the operation, under the judgment that re-ileostomy, essential for hospital discharge, seemed very difficult through another laparotomy, we attempted to make the ileostoma higher not with pulling the ileum from the abdomen but with lowering the surrounding skin using skin flap formation techniques. For re-ileostomy, we cored out the ileostoma to the external oblique muscle, followed by wide skin flap formation. Then, we lowered the peri-stomal skin level with subcutaneous fat resection. Finally, we sutured the skin flap to the ileostoma base. The skin defect area on the side wall of the ileostoma caused surgical site infection but shrank over time, finally leading to the fusion between the ileal mucosa and the ileostoma base skin. The patient has been well without major events, eating a normal diet for eight months after the re-ileostomy. In conclusion, general surgeons should note that this type of stoma re-making is a feasible and minimally invasive alternative to conventional stoma re-making through another laparotomy."

    "abstract": "Primary gastric T-cell lymphomas (PGTL) are exceedingly rare with an estimated incidence of 0.0091 per 100,000 person-years, affecting mainly elderly males. PGTL can present with a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms, but patients only rarely present with perforation. We report the case of a 68-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with a history of chronic abdominal pain that was localized to the epigastrium over the last few days. Computed tomography (CT) identified pneumoperitoneum. Exploratory laparotomy revealed gastric antral perforation. Histologically, perforation margins were diffusely involved by large pleomorphic lymphoma cells with multilobated nuclei and focal anaplastic morphology. Immunohistochemically, neoplastic cells were positive for CD3 (partial), CD4, CD5, CD7, CD43, CD45, BCL2, and BCL6 (dim). The neoplastic cells were negative for CD1a, CD2, CD8, CD10, CD20, CD21, CD23, CD30, CD34, CD56, ALK1, TdT, lysozyme, CXCL13, ICOS, PD1, myeloperoxidase (MPO), human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), and keratin. Ki-67 showed a proliferation rate of 80-90%, and in situ hybridization was negative for Epstein-Barr virus. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the T-cell receptors gamma (TRG) and beta (TRB) demonstrated monoclonal peaks. Quantitative PCR for HTLV-1 integration was negative. The diagnosis was peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, stage IV, consistent with primary gastric lymphoma. To better understand this neoplasm, we performed a comprehensive English language literature review, retrieving clinical, pathologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular data when available, and discussed the most relevant features for diagnosis and classification using the 5th edition of World Health Organization, as well as prognostic features and outcomes of this lymphoma."

Acute abdomen encompasses a range of different pathologies, with epigastric pain narrowing the differential diagnosis to conditions such as pancreatitis, bowel obstruction, acute cholecystitis, gastritis, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and peptic ulcer disease, such as gastric ulcers and duodenal ulcers with/without perforation. This is a case of a male patient in his 80s who came to the emergency department with symptoms of generalized abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation. Initial investigations and imaging supported a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis complicated by bowel obstruction. The patient was subsequently referred to the surgical team for further management."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most frequent abdominal surgical emergency worldwide. While luminal obstruction due to fecaliths and lymphoid hyperplasia is a common cause, parasitic infections are a rare but significant contributor. Enterobius vermicularis, the most common helminthic infection in developed countries, can trigger appendiceal inflammation through a mechanical obstruction or immune response. This report presents a case of a 16-year-old male with acute appendicitis secondary to E. vermicularis infestation. The patient presented with typical appendicitis symptoms, and laparoscopic appendectomy revealed the parasitic involvement, confirmed by histopathology. Postoperative recovery was uneventful following surgical intervention and anti-helminthic treatment. E. vermicularis is often an incidental finding in appendectomy specimens but may play a pathogenic role in some cases of appendicitis. This case underscores the importance of considering parasitic infections in patients with atypical presentations of appendicitis and highlights the value of histopathological examination in appendectomy cases."

    "abstract": "The diagnosis and management of cardiac trauma and penetrating cardiac injuries pose significant challenges in emergency settings due to the rapid onset of life-threatening complications. This paper presents a narrative review to better describe the etiology, presentation, and management of penetrating cardiac trauma, offering insights and experiences related to performing emergency surgery for such cases. We compiled cases of traumatic cardiac rupture and penetrating cardiac injuries accompanied by severe hemorrhagic shock that necessitated emergency surgery. Data were collected regarding the type of injury, causative agents, specific clinical features observed during emergency admission, intraoperative parameters, and treatment outcomes. Twenty-one patients (16 men, 5 women) with cardiac rupture or penetrating cardiac injuries were recorded. All patients presented in severe shock, and six cases (28.6%) experienced cardiac arrest upon arrival in the operating room. Cardiac rupture due to blunt chest trauma occurred in two cases (9.5%), and one case (4.8%) involved right atrial perforation due to complex open chest trauma. Penetrating injuries accounted for cardiac perforation in 18 cases (85.7%). Associated injuries were present in 11 cases (52.4%). The intraoperative mortality rate was 9.5%, and there was one postoperative death on the 11th day due to multiorgan failure. Cardiac trauma and penetrating injuries are usually fatal unless promptly diagnosed and surgically treated. The timing and rapidity of emergency surgery-often foregoing ancillary tests and administrative procedures-are critical for patient survival. Emergency sternotomy, swift control of bleeding, and aggressive resuscitation are essential operative measures in saving lives. Factors that influence prognosis include the extent of blood loss, duration of cardiac arrest, acid-base imbalances, coagulopathy, multiorgan failure, and postoperative infections."

    "abstract": "Type 1 gallbladder perforation (GBP) in the free abdominal cavity causes pan-peritonitis, which is both rare and difficult to diagnose. An 80-year-old man presented to our hospital with acute left upper abdominal pain. Twenty days prior to presentation, he had been admitted for 12 days with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The patient had mild cholecystitis and received conservative therapy for COVID-19. Upon readmission, his abdomen was flat and soft except for local peritonitis in the left upper abdomen. An emergency laparoscopy revealed a perforation in the ventral wall of the gallbladder neck discharging pus under the lateral lobe of the liver without a gastrointestinal perforation. Therefore, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and intra-abdominal lavage were performed. Based on the clinical and pathological findings, the GBP was suspected to be a rupture of the abscess in the Rokitansky-Aschoff sinus observed on magnetic resonance imaging during the first admission. In this case, acute cholecystitis was suppressed by conservative therapy, leaving adhesions of the surrounding tissue and viscus to the gallbladder fundus and body as well as an abscess in the wall of the neck. This was the cause of the GBP and resulted in local peritonitis within the left upper abdomen. Type 1 GBP develops suddenly and cannot be predicted. In cases of acute cholecystitis once suppressed by conservative therapy and accompanied by cystic formation in the gallbladder wall, early cholecystectomy is recommended considering the risk of GBP."

    "abstract": "From a global perspective, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hydatid cyst disease are both common; however, the endemic and zoonotic nature of hydatid cysts (due to Echinococcus larvae) makes the simultaneous detection of the two conditions a rare occurrence. In this case report, in a 43-year-old male patient, we aim to draw attention to the potential coexistence of HCC and liver hydatid cysts by presenting a case in which HCC tissue was detected in the cyst wall-removed by emergency surgery due to cyst perforation. Hydatid lesions in the liver may exhibit tumor-like growth characteristics. Consequently, identifying a hydatid cyst concomitant with HCC can be challenging, particularly when HCC has developed within the cystic structure. Careful assessment of resected tissues and detailed diagnostic approaches can facilitate the identification of such cases, even if the risk of HCC in patients with hydatid cysts is marginal. It may be advisable to suggest periodic monitoring with HCC-related markers and liver imaging methods."

    "abstract": "Ingestion of caustic substances is a common toxicological emergency, often resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Accidental ingestion of these toxic agents is most prevalent among children, who may encounter household cleaners and other hazardous substances out of curiosity. In contrast, adults often ingest caustic agents in the context of self-harm or suicide attempts. These agents can cause extensive damage to the gastrointestinal tract, leading to serious complications, including perforation, strictures, and systemic toxicity. Both acids and alkalis are particularly dangerous, as they can create irreversible injuries depending on their concentration and duration of exposure.  In this report, we detail the case of a middle-aged man who accidentally ingested a corrosive cleaner containing hydrochloric acid. One day post-ingestion, he presented with throat pain and odynophagia, raising immediate concern for possible gastrointestinal injury. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed, which revealed findings indicative of gastric necrosis, confirming the severity of the injury. Unfortunately, the patient lost follow-up after being discharged from the hospital. This case underscores the critical importance of recognizing the type of caustic substance involved in such emergencies and highlights the need for prompt medical intervention. Immediate identification of the ingested material, combined with rapid treatment, is essential to mitigate damage and improve patient outcomes."

This study investigated the predictive factors for NOM failure in SBO patients in a resource-limited setting. A retrospective study included 165 patients who were diagnosed with SBO and were admitted and managed at Althora General Hospital, IBB, Yemen, from April 2022 to March 2024. Patients' baseline characteristics and profiles along with factors associated with failure of NOM were investigated and analyzed with univariate and multivariate analysis. 51 (30.4%) of included cohorts were managed non-operatively. The mean age was 47.7±16.9 years, and males were disproportionally presented (62.7%). The majority of patients presented with abdominal pain (96.1%). Failure of NOM was seen in 18 (35.3%) patients and intra-operative findings were adhesive bands, volvulus, intussusception, and mesenteric ischemia in 7 (38.9%), 5 (27.8%), 4 (22.2%), and 2 (11.1%) patients, respectively. Bowel resection was performed in 11 (61.1%), and 4 of them needed a colostomy diversion. Postoperative complications occurred in 13 (25.5%) patients, including fever, paralytic ileus, surgical site infection, and reoperation in 13 (25.5%), 5 (9.8%), 4 (7.8%), and 2 (3.9%) patients, respectively. Sixteen patients were discharged, and two patients died due to mesenteric ischemia. Among NOM successful patients, recurrence has occurred in 8 patients. In multivariate analysis, poor bowel wall enhancement (OR: 8.59; 95% CI: 1.14-64.59, p=0.037) and high level of obstruction (OR: 11.64; 95% CI: 1.34-100.85, p=0.026) in computed tomography (CT) scan were independently associated with NOM failure. Poor bowel wall enhancement and significant obstruction on CT images are critical indicators for selecting SBO patients requiring urgent surgery. However, evaluating the advantages of surgical intervention versus NOM demands a comprehensive analysis of surgical risks, comorbidities, and the presence of bowel strangulation or ischemia."

These findings emphasize the importance of considering GMH in patients with unexplained recurrent gastrointestinal perforations. A 13-year-old female presented with acute abdominal pain. Her medical history included four prior surgeries for small intestinal perforations. Enhanced computed tomography revealed localized bowel thickening and perforation, prompting emergency surgery. A 20 cm segment of the ileum was resected and anastomosed. Pathological analysis confirmed extensive GMH with ulceration and perforation, identifying GMH as the cause of the recurrent perforations. Postoperatively, the patient recovered well with no recurrence by the 10-month follow-up. GMH should be considered in cases of recurrent unexplained intestinal perforations."

    "abstract": "Delayed diagnosis of acute appendicitis in children may result in complex appendicitis with appendiceal perforation. Delayed diagnosis can result from missed opportunity for initial diagnosis (MOID) despite medical attention. Studies report MOID of less than 5% in pediatric emergency departments (EDs), but we hypothesized that many MOID occurs outside tertiary care facilities. Our goals were to determine the MOID rate in all presenting facilities in children with complex appendicitis and to identify associated risk factors. Children (age ≤18) undergoing appendectomy for complex appendicitis between 2018 and 2022 at a single free-standing academic children's hospital were reviewed. Missed opportunity for initial diagnosis was defined as evaluation for related symptoms without a diagnosis of appendicitis within 7 days prior to appendectomy. Logistic regression and UpSet plots were used to identify associated risk factors. Of 856 children, 140 (16.4%) had MOID. Most MOID originated from nontertiary facilities [urgent care (38.6%), local EDs (26.4%), primary care (25.0%)] compared to our pediatric ED (11.4%). Compared to single-encounter diagnosis, MOID was associated with younger age (adjusted odds ratio per year [aOR] 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.88-0.97) and non-English/Spanish primary language (aOR 2.61, 95% CI: 1.18-5.76). Uninsured patients had lower MOID (aOR 0.22, 95% CI: 0.05-0.96). Missed opportunity for initial diagnosis was associated with more complications (33.6% vs 19.1%, P  < 0.0001), prolonged length of stay (6 vs 4 days, P  < 0.0001), and increased readmission (11.4% vs 6.6%, P  = 0.044). Missed opportunity for initial diagnosis of complex appendicitis occurs in nontertiary care facilities, is more common in younger children and non-English/Spanish speakers, and is associated with worse outcomes, highlighting the need for interpreters and algorithmic evaluation in nontertiary care facilities."

    "abstract": "Environmental changes and modifications in leisure habits have facilitated the emergence of new bacteria responsible for causing ear infections with different presentations. In this context, Turicella otitidis is a pathogen for which isolated cases of external and middle ear infections have been reported. However, our experience indicates a resurgence in its occurrence in recent years. The main objective of this study is to examine the possible connection between T. otitidis and the most frequent clinical ear manifestations, as well as the associated demographic characteristics. Additionally, it seeks to analyze the temporal evolution of the frequency of T. otitidis isolates and determine the overall antibiotic sensitivity pattern of this microorganism. A retrospective cohort study was conducted, including samples of ear exudates with T. otitidis from patients in the departments of Otorhinolaryngology, Pediatrics, and Emergency over the past seven years (2017-2024). Cultures were taken using fluid collection devices from the external ear in cases of diffuse external otitis (DEO) or through active, wet perforation in patients with acute otitis media (AOM) or chronic suppurative otitis media (COM). The bacterial cultures were grown using the PCR method. 67 patients (71 ears) were included, with a mean age of 19.45 ± 22.30 years, and 62.69 % (n = 42) being pediatric patients. The most frequent presentation was acute suppurative otitis media (AOM), accomplishing recurrent acute otitis media (rAOM) criteria in 32.35 % of cases, followed by diffuse external otitis (DEO) in 41.79 % (n = 28) of the cases. The relationship between T. otitidis and age, and between T. otitidis and the risk of rAOM, was statistically significant (p < 0.001 and p = 0.01, respectively). Additionally, chronic adenoiditis/adenoid obstruction combined with age was significantly related to the risk of recurrent infections (p = 0.02). Conversely, there was no significance when studying age with the risk of rAOM caused by T. otitidis alone (p = 0.77). This study highlights the importance of preventing and treating ear infections caused by Turicella otitidis, especially in the context of migration and changes in leisure habits. The pathogenic role of T. otitidis is debated, suggesting its involvement in various ear infections with antibiotic resistance. Preventive measures should include maintaining good ear hygiene, regular monitoring, and appropriate antibiotic selection based on susceptibility profiles. Further research is needed to clarify its pathogenic role and its relationship with factors such as age and adenoid obstruction. Despite limitations, this study expands knowledge on these emerging infections and raises questions for future research."

A 69-year-old woman was referred to our emergency department after an outpatient echocardiogram revealed a \"thrombus-like\" formation involving the right heart. Two weeks before she had undergone percutaneous vertebroplasty of the third to fifth lumbar vertebrae due to osteoporotic fractures. She presented with palpitations. Further investigations revealed polymethyl methacrylate leakage involving the inferior vena cava, the right atrium, and the right ventricle in the total. Although the patient was clinically and hemodynamically stable, decisions about the timing and the specific technique for surgical removal of the foreign body were challenging. Considerable multidisciplinary teamwork involving cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, anesthetists, and bioengineer specialists of the bone cement was necessary due to the extension of the consolidated leakage. Through a combined approach with sternotomy and fluoroscopic guidance, it was possible to remove the foreign body without intraoperative complications. The patient recovered and returned to her normal life, following cardiac and physical rehabilitation."

Despite advances in early diagnosis and treatment, CRC remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Up to 30% of CRC patients are diagnosed during emergency department visits, leading to surgical procedures that may not adhere to oncological principles due to complications like obstruction, bleeding, or perforation. This study aims to compare postoperative complications and long-term oncological outcomes between emergent and elective colon cancer surgeries. Retrospective analysis was performed on patients who underwent surgery for colonic adenocarcinoma from January 2018 to December 2021. Patients included were those diagnosed with colonic adenocarcinoma, excluding those under 18 years old or with other pathological results. Patients were examined under the elective and emergent surgery groups. The study investigated demographic data, tumor localization, operation type, postoperative complications, and long-term oncological outcomes. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to perform multivariate analysis in order to identify prognostic variables for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). A total of 318 patients were included, with 62 undergoing emergent surgery and 256 undergoing elective surgery. Patient demographics were similar between the groups. The emergent surgery group had a significantly lower OS rate at 50 months compared to the elective surgery group (51% vs. 62%, p = 0.002). DFS at 50 months was also lower for the emergent surgery group compared to the elective surgery group (43% vs. 59%), but this difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.202). Independent poor prognostic factors included stage N, stage M, tumor diameter, neural invasion, and emergent surgery status. Emergency surgery for colon cancer is associated with poor long-term outcomes due to shorter OS and DFS, highlighting the need for increased awareness and screening to reduce emergency colon cancer surgery."

    "abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic illness. Blood testing for tissue transglutaminase antibodies is the initial screening test for the diagnosis of CD, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and duodenal/jejunal biopsy are used to confirm CD. Intussusception (IS) is the process in which a proximal segment of the bowel invaginates through the lumen of a distal segment. The association between pediatric IS and CD has been described but is still not widely recognized. Herein, we report a case of IS as the first manifestation of CD in a child. A 3-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of marked abdominal distention and lethargy, but there was no history of fever, bleeding per rectum, or jaundice. A second-degree relative had a family history of CD. Clinical examination: The patient was a lethargic child with pale conjunctiva and bilateral lower limb edema. She was a febrile and had a normal hemodynamic status. The adipose tissue was diminished throughout the patient's body; her weight was 8 kg (<5% weight percentile for girls), and her height was 81 cm (<5% height percentile for girls). Laboratory results included the following: Hb of 9 g/dL, serum ferritin of 10 ng/mL (30-400 ng/mL), normal liver function test results except for hypoalbuminemia at 21 g/L (35-52 g/L), and low blood cholesterol of 0.94 g/L (1.54-2.01 g/L). The patient's blood sugar level was 98 mg/dL, and her renal function test results were normal, with negative septic screening. Abdominal radiography revealed several air-fluid levels, suggestive of an obstruction in the small bowel. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed typical features confirming the diagnosis of IS. Abdominal computed tomography demonstrated an enteroenteric IS with no other signs of organic causes, such as lymphoma or other tumors. Based on the high index of suspicion of CD, a workup confirmed the diagnosis. A gluten-free diet [A1] was started during the hospital course, and the patient improved dramatically regarding her symptoms and was discharged home. In conclusion, this case highlights the association between IS and CD. Intussusception is an emergency condition and usually idiopathic. However, in atypical or recurrent typical presentations underlying causes, we should do proper investigations to initiate appropriate management. [A1]Abbreviations are generally avoided for terms that are not repeated in the text. In this case, this abbreviation is not used elsewhere in the Abstract. Hence, I have deleted the abbreviation.

    "abstract": "Acute abdominal pain (AAP) constitutes 5-10% of all emergency department (ED) visits, with appendicitis being a prevalent AAP etiology often necessitating surgical intervention. The variability in AAP symptoms and causes, combined with the challenge of identifying appendicitis, complicate timely intervention. To estimate the risk of appendicitis, scoring systems such as the Alvarado score have been developed. However, diagnostic errors and delays remain common. Although various machine learning (ML) models have been proposed to enhance appendicitis detection, none have been seamlessly integrated into the ED workflows for AAP or are specifically designed to diagnose appendicitis as early as possible within the clinical decision-making process. To mimic daily clinical practice, this proof-of-concept study aims to develop ML models that support decision-making using comprehensive clinical data up to key decision points in the ED workflow to detect appendicitis in patients presenting with AAP. Data from the Dutch triage system at the ED, vital signs, complete medical history and physical examination findings and routine laboratory test results were retrospectively extracted from 350 AAP patients presenting to the ED of a Dutch teaching hospital from 2016 to 2023. Two eXtreme Gradient Boosting ML models were developed to differentiate cases with appendicitis from other AAP causes: one model used all data up to and including physical examination, and the other was extended with routine laboratory test results. The performance of both models was evaluated on a validation set (n = 68) and compared to the Alvarado scoring system as well as three ED physicians in a reader study. The ML models achieved AUROCs of 0.919 without laboratory test results and 0.923 with the addition of laboratory test results. The Alvarado scoring system attained an AUROC of 0.824. ED physicians achieved AUROCs of 0.894, 0.826, and 0.791 without laboratory test results, increasing to AUROCs of 0.923, 0.892, and 0.859 with laboratory test results. Both ML models demonstrated comparable high accuracy in predicting appendicitis in patients with AAP, outperforming the Alvarado scoring system. The ML models matched or surpassed ED physician performance in detecting appendicitis, with the largest potential performance gain observed in absence of laboratory test results. Integration could assist ED physicians in early and accurate diagnosis of appendicitis."

    "abstract": "Gallstone ileus is the mechanical obstruction of the bowel due to gallstone impaction. It forms when a fistula is created between the gallbladder and the gastrointestinal tract, which can result in small bowel obstruction. Its surgical management ranges from enterolithotomy, cholecystectomy, and fistula closure performed together (one-stage) or performed separately (two-stage), while some patients undergo simple enterolithotomy. Emergency surgery with open enterolithotomy, with or without biliary tract surgery, has been replaced by laparoscopic-assisted enterolithotomy as a safer and more rapid procedure. This report is of a 68-year-old woman treated with laparoscopic-assisted enterolithotomy for gallstone ileus which recurred. A 68-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, breast cancer, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis presented with a gallstone ileus and was surgically managed with successful laparoscopic-assisted enterolithotomy. Seven days after the initial surgery, she again presented with gallstone ileus requiring reoperation. A repeat laparoscopic-assisted enterolithotomy was performed with no complications and full resolution of her symptoms. Operative management of gallstone ileus and subsequent recurrence continues to be highly debated. With no randomized studies and limited data, there is no current gold standard surgical procedure for either setting. Simple laparoscopic-assisted enterolithotomy is the favored surgical technique as it is associated with decreased morbidity, mortality, operative time, and complications. This report demonstrates that a CT scan is crucial in differentiating recurrent gallstone ileus from postoperative ileus, with a repeat laparoscopic-assisted enterolithotomy providing a safe and effective treatment option. Moreover, patient follow up is essential for monitoring symptom resolution."

Eight days later, an EAF was established, and the abdomen was classified as grade 4 according to Bjork (classification of 2016). To manage this complication a four-step technique was employed: latex condom-EAF anastomosis, fistula ring creation, negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), and adaptation of an ostomy bag. Nine weeks later, the wound was fully healed, and the stoma completely matured. Several recent reports have discussed the treatment of this condition. Techniques employing a baby bottle nipple, silicon plug, and floating stoma have shown promising results. NPWT was considered to increase the risk of fistula formation for many years, but additional studies have demonstrated its safety. No gold standard therapy has been established for EAF treatment; therefore, decisions rely on the surgical staff's experience. This technique for effluent control in patients with a Björk grade 4 abdomen and established EAF is easily reproducible and safe."

    "title": "Procedure-Related Mortality in Aspiration Thrombectomy for Pulmonary Embolism: A MAUDE Database Analysis of the Inari FlowTriever and Penumbra Indigo Systems.",
    "abstract": "Pulmonary embolism (PE) is an important cause of death and disability. Advances in catheter-directed therapies have led to the use of devices, such as the Inari FlowTriever and Penumbra Indigo system for aspiration thrombectomy (AT) for both massive and sub-massive PE. However, limited data exist on causes of procedural mortality. Analysis of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacture and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was performed. Data for the Inari FlowTriever and Penumbra Indigo aspiration thrombectomy systems were evaluated for mortality events and classified by cause of death from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2023. The review identified 26 mortality events related to the Inari FlowTriever and 28 related to the Penumbra Indigo device. Pulmonary vascular perforation (n=26) and right heart injury/tamponade (n=9) were the most common source of mortality. Clot migration (n=4) and acute right heart failure (n=5) were less frequently observed. This study reveals more mortality events than have been captured in the literature to date. Vascular perforation and cardiac injury are the most common and also potentially preventable sources of mortality. Strategies to mitigate complications related to aspiration thrombectomy are described. Analysis of mortality in aspiration thrombectomy (AT) for acute pulmonary embolism is necessary to better understand the safety profile of this procedure. This analysis of the MAUDE database reports the largest single cohort of 54 deaths. Potentially preventable procedure-related mortality in AT has been documented to be the result of vascular perforation and cardiac perforation with tamponade. Preparation for emergent pericardiocentesis should be considered in mechanical thrombectomy. Clot migration may result from thrombus maceration or migration of clot in transit, thus, careful pre-procedure examination for clot in transit with echocardiography is suggested."

    "title": "Prognostic factors in patients with gastrointestinal perforation under the acute care surgery model : a retrospective cohort study.",
    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal perforation (GIP) is a life-threatening condition that necessitates immediate surgical intervention. This study aims to identify prognostic factors in patients with GIP treated within a standardized acute care surgery (ACS) framework. This single center retrospective cohort study analyzed patients diagnosed with GIP who underwent emergent surgery and were admitted to the intensive care unit between January 2013 and March 2023. Among 354 patients, the mortality was 11%, and 38% of survivors experienced significant complications (Clavien-Dindo class III or higher). Independent prognostic factors for mortality included initial sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores (at the time of admission or ACS activation), postoperative SOFA (p-SOFA) scores, and postoperative body temperatures. For morbidity, independent predictors were the extent of peritonitis, the open surgery, postoperative albumin levels, and p-SOFA scores. These factors showed significant predictive accuracy for patient outcomes, as evidenced by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The Random Forest model identified p-SOFA scores and postoperative albumin levels as the most significant predictors for both survival and complications, with feature importances of 40.46% and 36.61% for survival, and 39.97% and 37.28% for complications, respectively. Postoperative body temperature also played a moderately important role, contributing 14.63% to mortality and 15.9% to morbidity predictions. Patients with a p-SOFA score ≥ 7, postoperative albumin ≤ 2, and body temperature ≤ 36 °C, as well as those with a p-SOFA score ≥ 10, albumin ≤ 2.9, and body temperature ≤ 36 °C, had a 100% mortality rate. These factors are critical indicators for predicting patient outcomes. It is crucial to establish a system that ensures rapid preoperative work-up, accurate surgical intervention, and evidence-based postoperative critical care. Implementing such a system and assessing patient outcomes after surgery using the identified factors could provide a more detailed evaluation."

The causes of acute abdomen in children vary widely based on factors like geography and socioeconomic status. In developing countries, where infectious diseases are more prevalent, malaria can contribute to this condition. A 4-year-old boy from a malaria-endemic area presented with fever, vomiting, and prostration. Investigations revealed Plasmodium falciparum malaria. After initiating antimalarial treatment, he developed acute abdominal pain and was found to have a duodenal perforation. Emergency surgery was performed, and the perforation was repaired. Duodenal perforation in children, though rare, is a potentially life-threatening complication that can occur in the context of severe malaria. Prompt surgical management, typically involving omental patch repair of the perforation and treatment of the underlying malaria infection, is crucial for successful outcomes. Duodenal perforation in children following sever malaria attack is the rare which need urgent surgical and medical management."

    "abstract": "Acute abdominal pain in children is a common presentation in the clinic and emergency department settings and accounts for up to 10% of childhood emergency department visits. Determining the appropriate disposition of abdominal pain in children can be challenging. The differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain, including gastroenteritis, constipation, urinary tract infection, acute appendicitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, testicular torsion, and volvulus, and the diagnostic approach vary by age. Most causes of acute abdominal pain in children are self-limited. Symptoms and signs that indicate referral for surgery include pain that is severe, localized, and increases in intensity; pain preceding vomiting; bilious vomiting; hematochezia; guarding; and rigidity. Physical examination findings suggestive of acute appendicitis in children include decreased or absent bowel sounds, psoas sign, obturator sign, Rovsing sign, and right lower quadrant rebound tenderness. Initial laboratory evaluation may include urinalysis; complete blood cell count; human chorionic gonadotropin, lactate, and C-reactive protein levels; and a comprehensive metabolic profile. Ultrasonography, including point-of-care ultrasonography, for the evaluation of acute abdominal pain in children is the preferred initial imaging modality due to its low cost, ease of use, and lack of ionizing radiation. In addition to laboratory evaluation and imaging, children with red-flag or high-risk symptoms should be referred for urgent surgical consultation. Validated scoring systems, such as the Pediatric Appendicitis Score, can be used to help determine the patient's risk of appendicitis."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is a common surgical emergency in the pediatric population, affecting over 70,000 children per year in the United States alone. While historically practitioners predominately used computed tomography (CT) as the main diagnostic imaging modality, multiple professional societies have released guidelines recommending an ultrasound (US) first strategy when using imaging to confirm suspected appendicitis in pediatric populations. To date, no studies have quantified the change in imaging trends for pediatric appendicitis across the spectrum of healthcare facilities in the United States utilizing the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS). We aimed to evaluate the imaging trends for pediatric appendicitis across the nation, stratified by age and gender. Specifically, we wanted to delineate the use of CT alone versus US alone or US first imaging strategies. This retrospective cross-sectional study utilized data from the NEDS spanning from 2006 through 2020. We examined and analyzed the total number of patients, the number of patients with available imaging data, sex, age, and included imaging modalities utilizing descriptive statistics and regression analyses. Similarly, regression analysis was employed to discern differences in imaging rates in time intervals following societal imaging recommendations. From 2006 to 2020 the database recorded 160,828 encounters for pediatric appendicitis. Imaging data was available for 101,248 encounters, accounting for 63% of the total sample. Over the study period, both rates of \"US only\" and \"US first\" imaging modalities increased (from 5.5% to 38.9% and 8.9% to 55.6%, respectively), while rates of CT utilization in isolation declined (from 91.1% to 44%). While there is an increasing trend towards US being used as the first imaging modality to diagnose pediatric appendicitis across the spectrum of facilities included in the NEDS, continued utilization of CT to diagnose appendicitis remains unacceptably high in the pediatric population within the limits of this retrospective study."

Data analysed included demographics, operative details, G&S, crossmatching and perioperative blood transfusion.Results1105 patients were identified, 635 (57.4%) were male. Median age was 37 years (IQR 26-52). 1012 (91.6%) were ASA 1 or 2. Surgical approach: 890 (80.5%) laparoscopic, 79 (7.1%) converted to open, 119 (10.8%) open and 17 (1.5%) laparotomy. Severity of appendicitis: 804 (72.8%) inflamed, 56 (5.1%) gangrenous, 235 (21.3%) perforated and 10 (0.9%) normal. 921 (83.3%) patients had preoperative G&S. 42 (3.8%) patients also had crossmatch. No patients required blood transfusion in 30 days post appendicectomy. The cost of G&S is estimated to be £40,164 in this cohort.ConclusionsThe need for perioperative blood transfusion is rare in patients undergoing appendicectomy. It has a significant cost impact and can cause unnecessary delays. Our study suggests that a routine G&S policy is not necessary, and we suggest a more 'selective' G&S policy."

    "abstract": "Nontraumatic acute abdominal pain is a common presentation in emergency settings, often requiring surgical intervention. This study aimed to explore the clinical presentations, surgical management, and outcomes in patients with nontraumatic acute abdominal pain, providing insights for improving management strategies. This observational study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in North India and included 433 patients who underwent elective and emergency abdominal surgeries from June 2021 to May 2023. Data were collected on patient demographics, comorbidities, duration of symptoms, initial presenting symptoms, and surgical procedures performed. Laboratory parameters were assessed preoperatively, and postoperative outcomes, including complications, recovery metrics, and length of hospital stay, were recorded. Statistical analyses, including logistic regression, were utilized to determine the adjusted odds ratios for significant predictors of complications. A total of 433 patients were included in the analysis, with a mean age of 42.3 ± 12.1 years. The study revealed that 5.5% of patients experienced complications, with wound infections (3.0%) and intra-abdominal abscesses (0.9%) being the most common. Recovery metrics indicated that the mean time to resume oral intake was 2.5 ± 1.2 days, the time to first bowel movement was 3.0 ± 1.5 days, and the duration of the postoperative hospital stay averaged 5.0 ± 2.0 days. Logistic regression analysis identified significant predictors of complications, including diabetes mellitus (adjusted OR, 2.02; p < 0.001), hypertension (adjusted OR, 1.44; p = 0.025), and intraoperative findings such as appendiceal perforation (adjusted OR, 2.14; p < 0.001). The study underscores the critical role of timely diagnosis and appropriate surgical management in patients with nontraumatic acute abdominal pain. Recognizing high-risk factors, such as diabetes and elevated American Society of Anesthesiologists scores, can enhance surgical decision-making and improve patient outcomes. These findings advocate for refined management protocols and a multidisciplinary approach to optimize care for patients presenting with acute abdominal pain."

    "title": "Incidence and Outcomes of Emergency Presentation With Complicated Abdominal Wall Hernias: A Retrospective Study.",
    "abstract": "Aims This study aims to analyse the type of repair and post-op outcomes for individuals who underwent surgical intervention and presented with symptomatic abdominal wall hernia as an emergency. It highlights the importance of timely elective hernia management in lowering emergency presentations and any related complications. Background Abdominal wall hernias are common surgical conditions that can present electively or as emergencies, with emergency cases being associated with higher complication rates. In recent years, there has been an increase in emergency hernia presentations, leading to a greater number of urgent surgeries. These emergency operations have been linked to higher rates of post-op complications and re-interventions due to factors like bowel obstruction, strangulation, and delayed intervention. Therefore, research and analysis of post-op outcomes are essential to highlight the potential role of elective hernia management in reducing the burden of emergency cases. Methods This study was a single-institution retrospective study that looked at patient data over a 10-year period and involved patients who presented with abdominal wall hernias on an emergency basis and underwent surgical repair. Data were collected on patient demographics, presenting symptoms, hernia type, surgical technique, use of mesh reinforcement, post-op complications, re-intervention rates, and length of hospital stay. The database was developed and analysed with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 26 (Released 2019; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), and the results were considered significant at p<0.005. Results Over a 10-year period, 239 patients presented with emergency abdominal wall hernias, with 238 undergoing surgical repair; one patient died before surgery. Most repairs were performed using an open approach (93%, n=221), while 7% (n=17) were laparoscopic. Primary repair was conducted in 47% of cases (n=111), and mesh reinforcement was used in 53% (n=127). The overall recurrence rate was low (2%, n=4), with higher recurrence observed only in primary repairs. Mesh repairs had a higher incidence of post-op complications (56%, n=37) compared to primary repairs (44%, n=29). Patients who underwent mesh repair had an average hospital stay of eight days compared to those with primary repair (nine days). Inguinal, umbilical, and femoral hernias were the most common types observed, accounting for over 76% of cases. In total, 6% of patients (n=15) required bowel resections, highlighting the complexity of these cases. Most patients (72%, n=172) experienced no complications, but some of the most common post-op complications were wound dehiscence (7%, n=17), post-op collection (7%, n=16), delayed recovery (3%, n=8), and recurrence (2%, n=4). Conclusion It has been observed that a greater number of post-op complications and longer hospital stays are linked to emergency hernia procedures, especially when mesh repair is utilised. Although the recurrence rate of mesh repairs is lower than that of primary repair, the increased risk of complications highlights the significance of cautious surgical planning and patient selection. In conclusion, this study highlights the benefits of elective hernia management in reducing emergency presentations and the unfavourable consequences that may arise from it. These results support the importance of pre-op optimisation, especially for high-risk patients, and add to the debate on the best surgical techniques."

However, in cases of acute appendicitis complicated by an inflammatory phlegmon, a dilemma remains regarding the best management options. The aim of our study was to examine the outcomes for patients with an appendiceal phlegmon, comparing emergency appendectomy with those who had initial conservative management followed by subsequent interval appendectomy. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients diagnosed with acute appendicitis with inflammatory phlegmon (January 2012 to December 2022), looking into the outcomes of patients managed with emergency appendectomy versus conservative management and subsequent interval appendectomy. Results A total of 127 patients were included in our study: 85 (66.9%) underwent emergency appendectomy, and 42 (33.1%) underwent interval appendectomy. Patients who underwent emergency appendectomy had a significantly shorter duration of symptoms compared to those undergoing interval appendectomy (two vs. seven days). Furthermore, there was a higher likelihood of either a partial cecectomy or ileocolic/right hemicolectomy in those undergoing emergency appendectomy (p=0.021). However, there was no difference in 30-day morbidity or mortality. Conclusion This study highlights the challenges in managing appendiceal phlegmons. We propose that interval appendectomies should be considered for patients who present with extensive phlegmonous appendicitis and a prolonged duration of symptoms."

EPS is associated with severe complications, including bowel obstruction and sepsis, which can significantly impact patient outcomes. The first case involves a 41-year-old male patient who had undergone a liver transplant and ultimately succumbed to extensively drug-resistant (XDR) sepsis. The second case features a 31-year-old male patient diagnosed with abdominal tuberculosis, who successfully recovered following comprehensive antitubercular therapy (ATT). The third case presents a 26-day-old neonate with CHARGE syndrome (coloboma of the eye, heart defects, atresia of the choanae, retardation of growth and development, genital abnormalities, and ear anomalies, including deafness), who tragically succumbed to septic shock. The last case is of a 41-year-old male patient with disseminated tuberculosis who showed marked improvement with appropriate treatment. These cases illustrate the diverse clinical backgrounds and grave outcomes associated with EPS, highlighting the urgent need for early diagnosis and intervention. Despite EPS being a leading cause of small bowel obstruction in many inpatient settings, its diagnosis is frequently overlooked due to insufficient awareness among healthcare professionals. This series aims to enhance understanding of the causes, imaging characteristics, and management strategies for EPS. By disseminating this knowledge, we hope to facilitate earlier identification of the condition, particularly through primary imaging techniques such as ultrasound (USG). Ultimately, increasing awareness and understanding of EPS is crucial to improving patient outcomes and reducing the associated morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "Objective: This retrospective observational diagnostic accuracy study aims to demonstrate that open-access rapid-sequence non-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is accurate for exclusion or confirmation of acute appendicitis (AA). Methods: In 2017, a locally designed 12 min MRI protocol was made available as a new open-access option (no booking needed) for any emergency department (ED) or acute surgical patient with any clinical presentation at the authors' sites. Uninterrupted single-radiologist reporting availability was provided. A 5-year consecutive report list from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2023 was recorded in an activity log, from which 3478 eligible reports were identified as ED-based referrals assessing for possible AA. There was \"appendicitis possibility\" in 581/3478 (17%) reports and \"no evidence of appendicitis\" in 2897/3478 (83%). These were retrospectively compared with the medical record findings of 557/3478 proven cases of AA (16%). Report availability and reliability metrics have been assessed. Results: Overall, 2583/3478 reports (74%) were finalized within 2 h of MRI study completion, 3254/3478 (94%) within 4 h. The 3478 reports combined had 98% sensitivity, 98% specificity, 98% accuracy, 94% positive predictive value, and 99% negative predictive value for AA (φ = 0.95). The largest 5-year subgroup, females 15-19 years old, 66/440 with proven AA, had 98% report accuracy. Pregnant women, 21/171 with proven AA, had 99% report accuracy. Conclusions: The described MRI protocol is accurate for appendicitis assessment and is a suitable first-imaging choice for children, young adults, and pregnant women. It does not require intravenous contrast and poses no radiation risk."

Independent factors associated with arterial occlusive AMI were evaluated in a multivariable logistic regression analysis. The number of patients with arterial occlusive AMI was 231, consisting of thrombotic (n = 104), embolic (n = 61), and indeterminate (n = 66) occlusions. The non-AMI group included 287 patients, of whom 128 had strangulated bowel obstruction. Current smoking (odds ratio [OR] 2.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31-5.03), hypertension (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.09-3.97), bowel emptying (OR 3.25, 95% CI 1.59-6.63), and leukocytosis (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.14-2.08) at admission were independently associated with arterial occlusive AMI compared to the non-AMI group.

    "abstract": "Both patient and hospital-related factors determine the timing of appendicectomy for acute uncomplicated appendicitis. Recent literature suggests appendicectomy more than 24 h after hospital admission is associated with increased morbidity in adults. Current guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) recommend surgery within this timeframe to reduce the risk of complications. The aim of this study was to determine the time to surgery for patients with acute uncomplicated appendicitis and to compare this to the current WSES recommendations. This study also aimed to identify potential reasons for any in-hospital delay. This study is a retrospective review of all patients who underwent appendicectomy for confirmed acute uncomplicated appendicitis at an adult university teaching hospital between September 2021 and September 2022. Patient demographics, clinical information, time of admission, time of surgery, time of discharge and surgical complication data were collected. A total of 229 appendicectomies were performed during the study period. 138 (60 %) had a preoperative diagnosis of acute uncomplicated appendicitis. The median age was 36 years (range 17-93). Time to surgery was <24 h in 80 (58 %) patients and >24 h in 58 (42 %) patients. In patients with a delay of >24 h, 28 (48 %) had their surgery 24-36 h after admission, 23 (40 %) had their surgery between 36 and 48 h, and 7 (12 %) had their surgery >48 h after admission. Patients who were operated >24 h after admission had a higher rate of readmission, 4/58 (6.9 %) compared to 1/80 (1.25 %) in the less than 24 h group (p = 0.09). Delays in radiology, surgical ward beds and the lack of a dedicated emergency theatre may have contributed to extended waiting times. The results of this study show that the majority (58 %) of patients within our cohort were operated on within the WSES guidelines. However, 42 % of patients had their surgery in excess of these recommendations. Extended waiting periods may be related to delays in radiology, surgical ward beds and a lack of a dedicated emergency theatre. Patients who were operated on greater than 24 h following their admission also had a higher rate of readmission."

We report the case of a 65-year-old man with a significant history of long-term alcohol consumption who presented to our hospital (the Affiliated Hospital of Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine) with persistent oppressive pain in the anterior and posterior left chest. Initially, the patient was diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome based on the ECG findings, which showed Q-wave and ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads. However, further dynamic monitoring of myocardial necrosis markers, including myoglobin and troponin I, yielded negative results inconsistent with acute myocardial infarction. Subsequent enhanced computed tomography revealed thickening and discontinuity of the wall of the thoracic esophagus with an irregular, mixed-density shadowing of the surrounding soft tissue confirming the diagnosis of esophageal rupture. Despite prompt recognition and transfer to a hospital with surgical capabilities, the patient tragically succumbed to esophageal rupture and hemorrhage while awaiting surgery. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a broad differential, including esophageal rupture, in patients exhibiting necrotic Q waves and ST-segment elevation in the inferior wall of the ECG, especially in the absence of reciprocal changes in the lateral leads and the lack of abnormal markers of myocardial necrosis. Prompt recognition of this rare but potentially fatal condition is crucial for initiating appropriate treatment and improving patient outcomes. Emergency physicians should be aware of this atypical presentation of esophageal perforation mimicking an acute myocardial infarction and consider this differential diagnosis when faced with discordant clinical and diagnostic findings."

    "abstract": "Gallbladder perforation in acalculous cholecystitis is rare and has a high mortality rate due to biliary peritonitis and sepsis. Here, we present a case series of successful laparoscopic management of Spontaneous gallbladder perforation in acalculous cholecystitis. In the first case, a 44-year-old male patient presented to the emergency room with a history of three days of fever with chills and acute pain in the abdomen for two days. This was a case of typhoid-induced acalculous cholecystitis with gallbladder perforation, which is a rare clinical entity. The second case was a 62-year-old male, a known diabetic presented with pain abdomen and fever for four days. This was a case of acalculous spontaneous gallbladder perforation. The third case was a 53-year-old female patient with gallbladder perforation in acalculous cholecystitis. Radiological investigations suggested gallbladder perforation which was confirmed on diagnostic laparoscopy in all the cases. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with peritoneal lavage was performed. All the patients did well postoperatively and were discharged on postoperative day 4 after drain removal. One should be clinically vigilant about gallbladder perforation in a case of acalculous cholecystitis. Minimal access surgery techniques like laparoscopy can be applied to confirm the diagnosis as well as for definitive management."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency in children, yet it poses diagnostic challenges in preschool children due to atypical presentation. This case-control study aims to evaluate the distinct characteristics of acute appendicitis in preschool compared to school-aged children. Children under 5 years and a control group of children aged 5-10 years, operated on due to acute appendicitis at our institution during 2009-2022 were included. Data on demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory results, imaging, surgical procedure, pathology, bacteriology, antibiotic treatment, length of stay and outcomes were collected retrospectively. A total of 184 preschool and 187 school-aged children were included. Preschool children presented less frequently with abdominal pain but more often with vomiting, diarrhoea and fever. Preschool children had lower rates of leucocytosis but higher thrombocytosis and C reactive protein. Younger patients were more likely to undergo both chest and abdominal X-rays and be admitted to a paediatric department before diagnosing appendicitis. Complicated appendicitis, requiring increased use of intra-operative drain placement, and conversions to open procedures were more common in preschool children, with higher rates of ICU admission and surgical complications. Polymicrobial positive cultures and positive cultures for Bacteroides were more common in preschool children. This study highlights the critical need for increased awareness among healthcare providers regarding the diagnostic challenges posed by atypical presentations of acute appendicitis in preschool children. Despite comprehensive evaluation, diagnosis in this age group may be difficult, emphasising the significance of recognising these presentation patterns to improve diagnostic accuracy and prompt management."

Echocardiography showed an abnormal space between the ventricles, extending to the back of the left atrium, with a shunt from the left ventricle into both that abnormal space and the right ventricle. The next morning, the patient had a large amount of tarry stool and progressive anemia. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography( CT) revealed an opacified space behind the left atrium. The cardiologist considered the possibility of a pseudoaneurysm behind the left atrium perforated into the esophagus, and the patient was referred to our department for surgical treatment. An emergency operation was performed to repair the pseudoaneurysm behind the left atrium. We found a 5-mm defect just below the tricuspid valve. There was a space between the ventricles that communicate to the defect and to the rear. A defect also leaded to the left ventricle. The defect was closed using double patches placed in \"sandwich\" fashion, one on the left ventricle side and another on the right ventricle side. Postoperative contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed blood clot in the space between the ventricles."

    "abstract": "Cecal volvulus is an uncommon cause of large bowel obstruction that typically presents in older adults with a history of chronic constipation or prior abdominal surgery. However, this report documents a rare and atypical case of cecal volvulus presenting in a middle-aged female with no significant past medical or surgical history. This case also highlights the benefits of adopting a synergistic approach between a physician's clinical judgment and the patient's presentation when making a diagnosis to ensure timely interventions and prevent life-threatening complications. A 40-year-old female with no significant medical or surgical history presented to the emergency department with acute onset of severe abdominal pain radiating to the lower back, associated with nausea, vomiting, and constipation. CT imaging revealed a markedly distended cecum with evidence of volvulus. Despite the absence of common predisposing factors of cecal volvulus, the patient was correctly diagnosed. She underwent an urgent right hemicolectomy with primary anastomosis, which was uneventful. The patient had a complete recovery and was discharged home on postoperative day 5. This case is particularly noteworthy due to the patient's atypical demographic profile and the absence of common risk factors associated with cecal volvulus. The timely recognition and surgical intervention were critical in preventing severe complications such as bowel ischemia or perforation. Furthermore, this case underscores the importance of considering cecal volvulus in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain, even in patients who do not exhibit conventional risk factors. This case report highlights a rare presentation of cecal volvulus in a previously healthy middle-aged woman, emphasizing the importance of prompt diagnosis and intervention. The favorable outcome in this patient demonstrates the critical role of timely surgical management in such high risk cases."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Acute epiploic appendagitis is an uncommon cause of acute abdominal pain characterized by pain in the left or right lower quadrants of the abdomen. It is caused by torsion or spontaneous venous thrombosis of one of the epiploic appendages, which are found along the colon, most commonly in the sigmoid colon. The literature consistently compares the presenting symptoms and clinical picture of acute epiploic appendagitis to acute diverticulitis and acute appendicitis. However, ovarian torsion is not reported as a differential diagnosis for this pathology in the literature. CASE REPORT This case report demonstrates a female patient in her late 30s presenting with acute left iliac fossa pain associated with vomiting, in the context of a negative beta-hCG blood test. The history of severe unilateral intermittent pelvic pain progressing to constant pain associated with vomiting led to a working differential diagnosis of ovarian torsion. A bimanual vaginal examination was positive for tenderness in the left iliac fossa with no palpable adnexal masses or cervical motion tenderness. Therefore, the patient underwent an emergency diagnostic laparoscopy and was found to have normal ovaries, with torsion of an epiploic appendage identified. A diagnosis of acute epiploic appendagitis was made. CONCLUSIONS This case report demonstrates the importance of considering acute epiploic appendagitis as a rare differential diagnosis for ovarian torsion in female patients. With the management of this pathology being non-operative, identification of this condition on ultrasound or computed tomography is essential in avoiding unnecessary surgery for patients with this pathology."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Pacemaker implantation serves as a prevalent therapeutic approach for bradycardia or atrioventricular blocks associated with syncope. While generally regarded as safe, this procedure is not devoid of rare yet severe complications. Examples include lead-induced cardiac perforation resulting in pneumothorax or pericardial effusion, which pose life-threatening risks. CASE REPORT This article presents a case study detailing the experience of an 87-year-old patient diagnosed with complete atrioventricular block who underwent permanent pacemaker implantation, complicated by lead displacement and cardiac perforation. Despite the absence of typical post-implantation symptoms, such as backache, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and drops in blood pressure, the electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a right bundle-branch block pattern. Additionally, bradycardia and occasional pacemaker capture failure were observed the day following pacemaker implantation. Subsequent X-ray and computer tomography examinations confirmed displacement of the ventricular lead and the presence of cardiac perforation and left pneumothorax. Following emergent thoracic drainage and repositioning of the right ventricular lead, the patient was discharged without further complications. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the importance of thorough post-implantation monitoring, even in the absence of typical symptoms. Early detection through electrocardiogram, X-ray, and CT can facilitate timely intervention, as demonstrated by the successful treatment and discharge of the patient following emergent thoracic drainage and pacemaker lead repositioning."

We are presenting a young female patient, medically and surgically free, who presented to the Emergency Department with persistent right lower quadrant, associated with vomiting for 2 days. Vitally was stable, and labs were remarkable for leukocytosis and neutrophil shift. Abdomen CT scan showed a dilated appendix up to 1 cm with mural edema and hyperenhancement surrounded by mild fat stranding, minimal free fluid, and thickened adjacent peritoneal reflection. In conclusion, routinely performed surgeries can surprise the surgeon with unusual findings. Knowing the anatomy and possible associated anomalies is a cornerstone for any surgery.

    "abstract": "Vascular intestinal disease is a major health concern that often requires emergency surgery in patients with intestinal obstruction, perforation, or bowel necrosis. We aimed to provide data on the incidence, prevalence, mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of vascular intestinal diseases from 1990 to 2021, thereby contributing to the development of health policies. Using standardized methods from the 2021 Global Burden of Disease study, we analyzed the incidence, prevalence, mortality, and DALYs of vascular intestinal disease from the perspectives of the sociodemographic index (SDI), regional, and country, along with the corresponding estimated annual percentage changes. Additionally, we used join-point regression to identify the key time points for disease burden changes. In 2021, a total of 169,432 cases [95% uncertainty interval (UI): 155,127-185,189] of vascular intestinal disease were identified worldwide. The age-standardized incidence rate decreased from 18.81 (95% UI: 16.07-21.73) in 1990 to 15.98 (95% UI: 13.99-19.10) in 2021. In 2021, the age-standardized mortality rate was 1.12/100,000 people (95% UI: 1.00-1.21). Over the 32-year period, the global DALYs rate declined by 1.44 (95% Confidence Interval: -1.55 to -1.34). Within the five SDI regions, the high-middle SDI areas recorded the peak standardized mortality rates in 2021. Regionally, the greatest increase in incidence occurred in North Africa and the Middle East. Canada recorded the greatest national incidence rate [58.35 (95% UI: 50.05-67.37)] in 2021 among 204 countries, while Russia exhibited the highest related mortality [5.64/100,000 people (95% UI: 5.19-6.11)] and DALYs rate [101.48/100,000 people (95% UI: 93.83-109.66)].

According to the CARE checklist, we describe a rare case of blunt abdominal trauma with late diagnosis of jejunal perforation with an abscess that extensively dissected the retromuscular space. A 65 years-old female patient experienced multiple traumas after a traffic collision. Ten days after admission, the patient presented with swelling in the right abdomen. CT scan showed localised pneumoperitoneum and extensive collection affecting the right retrorectal space, reaching the ribs and preperitoneal space. Urgent laparotomy was performed and jejunal perforation with biliary peritonitis and extraperitoneal extension with dissection of the right retrorectal space were found. Intestinal resection with anastomosis was then performed. Exhaustive lavage of the cavity and retromuscular space with debridement of the necrotic posterior rectus lamina was required. Retrorectal drainage was placed. Primary closure of the aponeurosis was achieved using a small-bites technique with a slowly absorbable monofilament suture. Due to the weakness of the abdominal wall, an absorbable biosynthetic mesh impregnated with gentamicin was placed onlay. Negative pressure therapy was applied to the closed wound. Patient received antibiotics and CTs showed favourable evolution. No infectious complications or incisional hernia were reported after 12 months of follow-up. No cases of blunt trauma causing extensive AW infection have been reported in the literature. Whilst rare, this should be considered in traumatic patients. Our experience shows that they can be managed with surgical drainage and absorbable meshes can be considered in cases of fascial loss."

Although gastrointestinal (GI) metastasis is rare, it poses significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges and is frequently linked to severe complications. We present a case of a 61-year-old male with a history of lung cancer who presented with intestinal obstruction. The initial diagnosis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) and bronchoscopic biopsy. The patient underwent chemotherapy, after which he developed intestinal obstruction. Further imaging and histopathological analysis indicated GI metastasis. Despite treatment with both chemotherapy and immunotherapy, the patient experienced recurrent obstruction, necessitating surgical intervention. Postoperatively, he had another episode of perforation, which was addressed with an emergency laparotomy, revealing metastatic adenocarcinoma at the site of perforation. This case highlights the complexities in diagnosing and treating GI metastases from lung cancer. It underscores the necessity for multimodal treatment strategies and underscores the urgent need for research focused on early detection methods to improve patient outcomes."

We report the case of a 46-year-old male who arrived at the emergency department with a two-day history of diffuse abdominal pain, with an otherwise negative review of systems, an unremarkable medical and surgical history, and normal laboratory results. The physical examination revealed a palpable, non-reducible mass in the right groin, raising suspicion of an inguinal hernia. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was conducted, confirming Amyand's hernia, characterized by the presence of the vermiform appendix within the hernia sac in the dilated right inguinal canal. Amyand's hernia is a rare and clinically challenging condition to diagnose because its symptoms are nonspecific and often resemble those of other inguinal hernias. Delayed diagnosis can heighten the risk of complications, including inflammation, infection, perforation, and acute appendicitis. Mortality rates for Amyand's hernias have been reported to be between 14% and 30%, primarily due to complications associated with infections, especially peritoneal sepsis. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of Amyand's hernia, usually involving surgical hernia repair and an appendectomy if appendicitis is present, are highly effective in preventing potentially life-threatening complications. Despite their rarity, the difficult nature of the diagnosis and the associated high mortality rate underscore the importance of considering Amyand's hernia as a serious differential diagnosis."

This report presents the case of a patient with ILC who developed ileocecal valve metastasis leading to cecal volvulus, a rare but critical complication. The slow dissemination of ILC delayed the diagnosis and allowed for significant tumor burden at the ileocecal junction with consequent intestinal occlusion, resulting in acute abdominal symptoms and the need for surgical intervention. Treatment strategies for ILC, which may include surgery, radiation, and systemic therapies, vary based on the tumor's stage and hormonal receptor status. In this particular case, the patient underwent an emergent right hemicolectomy with subsequent treatment with fulvestrant. This case highlights the importance of vigilant monitoring for unusual metastatic sites in ILC and underscores the need for comprehensive treatment approaches tailored to individual patient profiles."

Recent studies have indicated a stoma-related complication rate of up to 83%.The aim of the current study was to ascertain the most common indications for ileostomy formation and to determine whether there were differences in the complication rates depending on whether the surgery occurred in the emergency or elective setting. Methods The study was a retrospective audit conducted at the University Hospitals of Leicester. Inclusion criteria were patients who underwent ileostomy formation between January 1 and December 31, 2023. Results The study cohort comprised 97 patients. Eleven of 44 (25.0%) patients in the emergency cohort had stoma-related complications, with their main reasons being high output stomas and bowel obstruction, which is higher compared to the elective patient cohort which had a complication rate of 5/53 (9.4%), with their main reasons being parastomal hernias and stoma prolapse. Ileostomies formed as a result of colorectal malignancy also led to a higher complication rate. Conclusion Our study suggests that ileostomies formed in the emergency setting as well as those formed due to colorectal malignancies had a higher rate of stoma-related complications. Stoma-related complications continue to be a common presentation to the emergency department."

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the frequency, presentation and surgical outcomes of complicated appendicitis. Patients who underwent appendectomy for acute appendicitis one year before and one year after the declaration of the pandemic were investigated. Demographics and diagnostic findings as well as surgical and histopathological outcomes were recorded and statistically analyzed. The study group of 409 patients was composed of 241 cases in the pre-pandemic group and 168 cases in the pandemic group revealing that the weekly total number of appendectomies decreased during the pandemic [pre-pandemic, median (IQR): 5 (3-6); pandemic, median (IQR): 3 (2-5); p=0.005]. The pandemic group was significantly associated with a longer time from emergency department admission to hospitalization, increased mean blood C-reactive protein levels and increased rate of postoperative complications (p=0.024, p=0.038 and p=0.004, respectively). Most importantly, pathological examinations revealed a higher number of complicated appendicitis cases in the pandemic group when compared to the pre-pandemic group [26 (15.5%) vs. 19 (7.9%), respectively] which corresponded to a 2.1-fold higher risk of being diagnosed with complicated appendicitis during the pandemic [OR: 2.1 (95% CI: 1.1-4.1), p=0.024].

    "abstract": "Neonatal intestinal malrotation complicated by midgut volvulus is a serious and common life-threatening complication. When the midgut volvulus is prolonged or severe, it can lead to secondary necrosis of the entire midgut, with high mortality rates. Therefore, improving understanding the clinical characteristics of this condition is necessary to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment. Herein, we report a case of congenital intestinal malrotation and necrosis of the midgut volvulus in a newborn. The patient was admitted to the hospital with vomiting, abdominal distension, and bloody stools. An emergency laparotomy revealed a large-area necrosis of the small intestine and torsion of the mesenteric root. External intestinal placement was performed initially, followed by a secondary laparotomy 72 hours later, which showed complete necrosis of the jejunum but recovery of the ileum. Duodenal and ileal ultra-high position fistulas were created, which were managed by intestinal fluid return and milk micropump feeding. Following that, fistula formation was performed 84 days after the second operation, and full enteral feeding was quickly achieved. The growth and development of the child were good at later follow-ups. The condition of the intestine in severe cases of neonatal intestinal malrotation combined with necrosis of midgut volvulus is unpredictable. The comprehensive management of operation timing, operation method, and close cooperation between neonatal physicians, surgeons, and nursing teams can greatly improve the success rate of treatment."

To analyze the clinical data of elderly patients undergoing emergency appendectomy for acute appendicitis, aiming to improve treatment strategies. The clinical data of 122 patients over 80 years old who underwent emergency appendectomy for acute appendicitis at the Department of Emergency Surgery of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University from January 2016 to March 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of an appendicolith or not, and clinicopathological and surgery-related features were compared between the two groups. The duration of abdominal pain in all 122 patients ranged from 5 to 168 h. All patients underwent emergency appendectomy: 6 had an open appendectomy, 101 had a laparoscopic appendectomy, and 15 required conversion from laparoscopic to open surgery, resulting in a conversion rate of 12.9% (15/116). The patients were divided into two groups: Appendicolith group (n = 46) and non-appendicolith group (n = 76). Comparisons of clinicopathological features revealed that patients with appendicoliths were more likely to develop appendiceal gangrene (84.8% vs 64.5%, P = 0.010) and perforation (67.4% vs 48.7%, P = 0.044), and had a lower surgical conversion rate (2.2% vs 19.7%, P = 0.013). The median length of hospital stay was 5.0 d for both groups and there was no significant difference between them. All patients were successfully discharged. Around 40% of patients over 80 years old with acute appendicitis have an appendicolith, increasing their risk of developing appendiceal gangrene and perforation, and therefore should receive timely surgical treatment."

A retrospective single-center observational study was performed on 60 patients admitted at our department for esophageal perforations or treated for an anastomotic leak developed after esophageal surgery from January 2008 to December 2023. Clinical outcomes were analyzed, and complications were evaluated to investigate the efficacy and safety of our multidisciplinary management based on the preservation of the native or reconstructed esophagus, when feasible. Among the whole series of 60 patients, an urgent surgery was required in 8 cases due to a septic state. Fifty-six patients were managed by endoscopic or hybrid treatments, obtaining the resolution of the esophageal leak/perforation without removal of the native or reconstructed esophagus. The mean time to resolution was 54.95 ± 52.64 days, with a median of 35.5 days. No severe complications were recorded. Ten patients out of 56 (17.9%) developed pneumonia that was treated by specific antibiotic therapy, and in 6 cases (10.7%) an atrial fibrillation was recorded. Seven patients (12.5%) developed a stricture within 12 months, requiring one or two endoscopic pneumatic dilations to solve the problem. Mortality was 1.7%. A proper multidisciplinary approach with the choice of the most appropriate treatment can be the key for success in managing esophageal leaks or perforations and preserving the esophagus."

    "abstract": "Acute intestinal obstruction (AIO) is one of the most common emergency surgical presentations, with small bowel obstruction (SBO) accounting for the majority of cases. Here, we present a case of a 68-year-old female patient who presented to the emergency department with signs and symptoms of SBO. Her medical history was unremarkable except for an open appendectomy performed in her 20s. A computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the diagnosis of SBO with a transition point in the right iliac fossa with no evidence of ischemia. After the failure of conservative management, diagnostic laparoscopy showed that the SBO was found to be secondary to an internal hernia caused by adhesions. The adhesions were released, and the SBO was resolved; the surgery was completed laparoscopically, enhancing the patient's recovery. This case supports the growing evidence that laparoscopy can be a safe and effective approach for managing SBO, even in cases where conservative management fails. With careful patient selection and surgical expertise, laparoscopy can reduce the need for more invasive procedures and improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Nasal packing is commonly employed in the emergency department (ED) to manage epistaxis that does not respond to conservative treatments. However, this intervention may increase the risk of nasal septal perforation (NSP) due to reduced blood flow to the nasal septum. No prior study has explored the relationship between nasal packing and risk of NSP. We examined all patients who received non-absorbable nasal packing in the ED at our institution, identifying 19 patients diagnosed with NSP post-treatment and 50 randomly selected patients without NSP for comparison. t-Tests and Chi square tests were utilized to compare numeric and categoric variables respectively and a multivariable logistic regression model was developed to assess risk factors. Baseline characteristics of individuals who developed NSP were similar to those of the comparison group, with the exception of tobacco use. Interestingly, individuals with NSP had a lower rate of tobacco use (21 % vs 64 % current/former users, p = 0.004). Univariable analysis revealed that patients with NSP had a longer mean duration of nasal packing (5 vs 3 days, p = 0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that each additional day of packing increased odds of NSP by 77 %, and bilateral packing, compared to unilateral, was associated with four times the odds of NSP. Our findings indicate that prolonged nasal packing increases the risk of NSP. Prospective, large-scale studies are needed to identify patients at risk for NSP after nasal packing in the ED and to inform guidelines on the removal of nasal packing."

    "abstract": "Antibiotic therapy is currently considered a safe and effective treatment alternative for computed tomography (CT)-confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis with recent studies reporting good results on both oral antibiotics only and outpatient management. Furthermore, there are promising pilot results on uncomplicated acute appendicitis management with symptomatic treatment (placebo). This trial aims to assess whether both antibiotics and hospitalization can be safely omitted from the treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis. The APPAC IV (APPendicitis Acuta IV) trial is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter noninferiority clinical trial comparing oral moxifloxacin with oral placebo in an outpatient setting with a discharge directly from the emergency room (ER). Adult patients (18-60 years) with CT-confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis (absence of appendicolith, abscess, perforation, tumor, appendiceal diameter ⩾15 mm on CT, or body temperature >38 °C) will be enrolled in nine Finnish hospitals. Primary outcome is treatment success at 30 days, that is, the resolution of acute appendicitis resulting in discharge from the hospital without appendectomy during the 30-day follow-up evaluated using a noninferiority design with a noninferiority margin of 6 percentage points. Noninferiority will be evaluated using one-sided 95% confidence interval of proportion difference between groups. Secondary endpoints include postintervention complications, recurrent appendicitis after the 30-day follow-up, duration of hospital stay, admission to hospital and reason for admission, readmissions to emergency department or hospitalization, VAS pain scores, quality of life, sick leave, and treatment costs. The follow-up after discharge from the ER includes a phone call at day 1, and at 3-4 days, 30 days, and 1, 3, 5, 10, and 20 years. Those eligible patients, who decline to undergo randomization, will be invited to participate in a concurrent observational cohort study with follow-up at 30 days, and 1 and 5 years. To our knowledge, APPAC IV trial is the first large randomized, double-blind, noninferiority multicenter clinical trial aiming to compare oral antibiotics and placebo for CT-diagnosed uncomplicated acute appendicitis in an outpatient setting. The study aims to bridge the major knowledge gap on whether antibiotics and hospitalization or both can be omitted in the treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis. The study protocol has been approved by the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), study number: 2023-506213-21-00 and the trial has been registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT06210269."

    "abstract": "Primary anastomosis and stoma are the main options in the restoration of intestinal continuity following urgent sigmoidectomy in sigmoid volvulus (SV). Our purpose was to evaluate the outcomes of both techniques in a 1,083-patient SV series. Total 1,083 cases with SV treated in Ataturk University Research Hospital in 58-year period between June 1966 and July 2024 were included in this study. We reviewed the records of 612 patients (56.5%) retrospectively, while the remaining 471 cases (43.5%) were evaluated prospectively. We investigated some preoperative, operative, and postoperative characteristics in non-matched analyses. Among total 379 patients treated with urgent colectomy, primary anastomosis was used in 173 cases (45.6%), while stoma was required in 206 patients (54.4%). The mean age was significantly lower in primary anastomosis group (P<0.005), while male/female ratios were statistically similar (P>0.05). Mean ASA score (P<0.001) and rates of shock (P<0.001), bowel gangrene (P<0.001), bowel perforation (P<0.01), and risky bowel (P<0.005) were also significantly lower in the primary anastomosis group. When stoma closure was considered, operation time was significantly shorter (P<0.001), additionally, morbidity and mortality rates were significantly lower in the primary anastomosis group (P<0.001, in each). The distributions of reoperation rates were statistically similar in both groups (P>0.05). Conversely, hospitalization time was significantly shorter and cost was significantly lower in the primary anastomosis group (P<0.001, in each). Primary anastomosis has some advantages in comparison to stoma in the restoration of intestinal continuity following urgent sigmoidectomy in SV. However, stoma is generally preferred in patients with bad health status, old age, and risky bowel. New prospective randomized clinical studies or matched analyses may help to clarify the optimal choice."

Diaphragmatic hernia is a rare complication but often requires reoperation. Given its poor characterization, clinicians and radiologists should remain vigilant about this potential issue. At our center, after 1233 donor hepatectomy operations performed between 2004 and 2024, 2 cases (0.16%) of postoperative diaphragmatic hernia were observed. Both patients were operated on under emergency conditions and via a transabdominal approach. We present these 2 cases along with a literature review. Patients should be treated even if they are asymptomatic. As far as we know, 38 cases have been reported in the literature, with most treated surgically. Both transabdominal and transthoracic approaches can be used. Primary repair or mesh repair can be performed. The patients in our series are followed up without any problems after the operation. If left untreated, it can lead to complications that may result in death. In our article, we aim to present this rare complication through 2 case reports, accompanied by a review of the relevant literature."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of acute abdomen. It is important to differentiate between complicated and uncomplicated appendicitis before surgery in the emergency department. Recently, immature granulocytes have become one of the biomarkers used as predictors of inflammation. The aim of this study was to determine whether immature granulocyte levels are a biomarker that can predict whether acute appendicitis is complicated or not in patients admitted to the emergency department. Patients aged 18 years and older who presented to the emergency department between May 1, 2023, and April 30, 2024, and were diagnosed with appendicitis were included in the study. Patients with a histopathologic diagnosis of acute appendicitis were divided into two groups: acute simple appendicitis (n=149) and acute complicated appendicitis (n=103). Demographic characteristics, imaging results, and laboratory results were recorded. White blood cell, neutrophil count and percentage, lymphocyte count and percentage, immature granulocyte count and percentage, direct bilirubin, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin values were found to be significantly higher in the complicated appendicitis group than in the uncomplicated group (p-values; 0.001, <0.001, <0.001, <0.001, 0.001, <0.001, <0.001, <0.001, <0.001, 0.016, <0.001, and 0.001, respectively). The immature granulocyte percentage was 92% specific for the diagnosis of complicated appendicitis at a cut-off value of 0.6. The immature granulocyte percentage may be useful as a predictive biomarker in the diagnosis of complicated acute appendicitis with a specificity of 92%. Additionally, the immature granulocyte percentage has a higher discrimination power than the immature granulocyte count, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin."

The clinical exploration presented painful abdomen with epigastrium peritoneal irritation. Laboratory tests showed elevated amylase (2600 U/l) and lipase (1127 U/l), with leukocytosis and neutrophilia. CT scan reported acute pancreatitis versus prepyloric gastric perforation, although no extraluminal gas was described, and a sharp foreign body was objectified penetrating the pancreatic parenchyma. Given the findings, laparoscopic exploration was decided. After the exploration of the omentum transcavity, gastric posterior wall and pancreatic cell, only hematoma and several subcentimeter necrotic pancreatic nodules were observed. There was no evidence of foreign body nor continuity solution in the gastric wall, so we carried out an intraoperative switch to supraumbilical laparotomy. Finally, by digital palpation, a 15mm fishbone (Fig 3) was identified in the referred pancreatic parenchyma. The patient was discharged from the ICU on the second day, but her hospital admission needed to prolong due to a paralytic ileus and a subsequent flare-up of ulcerative colitis, treated by the Digestive Department. She remains without complications 12 months later."

Given that it can lead to partial or total evisceration, bowel strangulation, sepsis, and acute mesenteric ischemia. Any instance of this complication should be treated as a surgical emergency. In this context, we report a case of a vaginal stump following regular use of pessaries. A 50-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with sudden onset of bowel-like prolapse from the vagina. She had a 7-year history of vaginal prolapse and had previously undergone repair surgery and laparoscopic hysterectomy for uterine fibroids. Following her hysterectomy, she began using a pessary due to recurrent prolapse. Clinical assessment revealed vaginal evisceration of the intestines, necessitating emergency surgery. She was discharged smoothly on the eighth day post-operation. Three months later, she underwent a laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy. The utilization of pessaries may heighten the risk of stump rupture in patients following hysterectomy, thereby demanding more vigilant attention from gynecologists."

    "abstract": "Intestinal obstruction (IO) is a surgical emergency with high morbidity and mortality. The leading causes in adults include adhesions, incarcerated hernias, and tumors. This three-year retrospective study reviewed adult patients with IO treated at Mogadishu Somalia Turkey Training and Research Hospital from June 1, 2019, to June 1, 2022. Of the patients studied, 67% were male, with a male-to-female ratio of 2:1. The most common symptoms were nausea and vomiting (93.2%), abdominal distension (90.2%), and inability to pass stool or gas (70.8%). Surgical management was required for 95.1% of patients, with only 4.9% managed conservatively. The most frequent postoperative complication was surgical site infection. Hospital stays for 52% of patients ranged from 8 to 14 days. The overall mortality rate was 4.9%. IO remains a critical surgical emergency worldwide, requiring urgent intervention. Aggressive treatment of hernias and timely surgical intervention for mechanical obstruction are essential to reduce complications and mortality. Delayed presentations contribute to higher mortality rates. Small bowel obstruction was more frequent than large bowel obstruction, with fibrous adhesions and incarcerated hernias as the leading causes. Adhesiolysis and bowel resection with anastomosis were the most common surgical procedures. Further research using prospective study designs is recommended to improve understanding and outcomes."

    "abstract": "Background: The surgical environment can influence the clinical outcomes of procedures and patient conditions. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate how surgical timing affects short-term outcomes in emergency laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis. Methods: A total of 647 patients with acute appendicitis who underwent emergency laparoscopic appendectomy at Chuncheon Sacred Heart Hospital between January 2018 and June 2021 were included in this study. The study cohort was divided into the following two groups based on the timing of surgery: work hours and out-of-hours (weekends, holidays, or weekday nights). Clinical outcomes were then compared between the groups. Results: Work-hour and out-of-hours appendectomies were performed in 282 and 365 patients, respectively. Baseline characteristics and types of appendicitis were similar between the groups (complicated appendicitis: 26.6% in the work-hours group versus 30.4% in the out-of-hours group, P = .288). Operation times were comparable (35.10 minutes versus 34.33 minutes, P = .620), with no cases requiring conversion to open appendectomy in either group. The overall rate of 30-day postoperative complications did not differ significantly between the groups (7.8% versus 10.4%, P = .849). The severity of postoperative complications, categorized by the modified Clavien-Dindo classification, did not show significant differences between the groups (P = .849). In addition, the time to functional recovery was similar in both groups. Conclusions: The clinical outcomes of out-of-hours laparoscopic appendectomy were similar to those of procedures performed during working hours. Therefore, scheduling emergency surgery can be determined based on the patient's condition and the hospital's capacity to manage acute appendicitis."

    "abstract": "Malignant bowel obstructions (MBO) are complex, heterogeneous disease processes which can be managed with surgical or endoscopic interventions. Patients with MBO often have advanced metastatic disease and poor functional status, which makes it difficult for providers to determine the best treatment strategy. Patients with urgent or emergent admissions and a primary or secondary ICD-9/ICD-10 diagnosis of bowel obstruction with an additional diagnosis of disseminated cancer were identified from the National Inpatient Sample (2000-2017). Patients were stratified into operative and non-operative intervention groups. Multivariate regression determined factors associated with surgical treatment of MBO based on significant factors on univariate analysis. Trends in treatment over time were calculated using log-linear regression to determine the annual percent change (APC). Of 1118 patients, 18% underwent surgery and 7% underwent endoscopic intervention. From 2000 to 2017, a decreasing proportion of patients underwent surgery (APC -2.4, p = 0.023) with a commensurate increase in endoscopic interventions (APC 5.3, p = 0.042). There was also a decrease in the proportion of patients who died during hospitalization (APC -4.3, p = 0.029). Surgery was associated with longer mean lengths of stay (13 days vs. 7 days, p < 0.001) and higher rates of in-hospital mortality (13% vs. 6%, p = 0.001) compared to non-operative management. The proportion of patients receiving surgery for MBO is decreasing and that receiving endoscopic interventions is increasing. In-hospital mortality is also decreasing proportionately, suggesting an improvement in patient selection."

    "abstract": "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a rare developmental anomaly where a defect in the diaphragm allows abdominal organs to migrate into the thoracic cavity, impairing lung function. While typically identified in neonates, delayed presentations, though uncommon, can complicate diagnosis and treatment. Early detection is vital to prevent severe complications such as organ strangulation or perforation. We present the case of a 9-year-old boy with a history of fetal hypotrophy and unexplained poor weight gain, presenting with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and respiratory distress. Imaging revealed a large left diaphragmatic defect with gastric volvulus and perforation. Emergency surgery confirmed herniation of the stomach and transverse colon, with extensive gastric necrosis. The procedure involved repositioning organs, repairing the diaphragm, and removing necrotic tissue. Postoperative complications included bilateral pleural effusion and septic shock, requiring intensive care. The patient recovered well after stabilization and a gradual return to enteral feeding. At the nine-month follow-up, he demonstrated healthy weight gain and was symptom-free. Delayed CDH presentation, though rare, demands clinical vigilance, particularly in children with unexplained gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms. Life-threatening complications such as gastric volvulus and perforation necessitate prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention. Postoperative management of complications like pleural effusion and sepsis is crucial for recovery. This case highlights the importance of recognizing atypical CDH presentations. Early diagnosis and appropriate intervention are key to preventing severe outcomes and ensuring favorable recovery and long-term quality of life."

    "abstract": "Background Several studies have investigated the role of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in diagnosing and predicting the severity of acute appendicitis; however, few studies have analyzed its usefulness in pediatric appendicitis patients particularly in predicting postoperative complications. We investigated the role of NLR and assessed its clinical utility as a predictor of postoperative infectious complications in children with acute appendicitis. Methodology We performed a prospective cross-sectional study from July 2023 to July 2024 on 135 pediatric patients aged five to 12 years undergoing emergency appendectomy and having operative findings or histopathological confirmation of appendicitis. NLR was calculated from differential leucocyte count at the time of presentation to the emergency department. Patients were followed for one month after surgery for the development of complications. Univariate and multiple logistic regression was used to identify clinical factors significantly associated with postoperative complications. The sensitivity and specificity of these parameters to predict complications were determined using receiver operating characteristic curves. Results The average age was 8.36 ± 2.38 years. There were 36 (26.67%) laparoscopic and 99 (73.33%) open appendectomies. Eighty-three (61.48%) patients had simple while 52 (38.52%) had complicated appendicitis. NLR, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly higher in patients with complicated appendicitis (p < 0.05). Twenty-nine patients (21.48%) developed complications like wound infection (n = 29, 21.48%), wound dehiscence (n = 5, 3.7%), prolonged ileus (n = 12, 8.89%), intra-abdominal abscess (n = 7, 5.19%), and early adhesive obstruction (n = 4, 2.96%). Univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis of the clinical parameters revealed that NLR (OR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.004-1.64), PLR (OR: 1.01, 95% CI: 1.001-1.01), and type of appendicitis (OR: 7.11; 95% CI: 1.57-32.22) had an independent significant association with all postoperative complications (p < 0.05). NLR and PLR presented an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86 (p < 0.001) and 0.83 (p < 0.001), respectively, which was significantly higher than the AUC of neutrophil count (AUC: 0.66, p = 0.006), lymphocyte count (AUC: 0.80, p < 0.001), CRP (AUC: 0.70, p = 0.001), and plasma sodium levels (AUC: 0.64, p = 0.006). NLR and PLR showed the highest sensitivity (79.3% and 79.3%) and specificity (95% and 82.1%) at cut-off values of 9.53 and 166.01, respectively. Conclusion The NLR can be used for distinguishing complicated from uncomplicated appendicitis, for prioritizing cases for operative management, and for identifying patients likely to experience complications after surgery."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Pericardiocentesis is a commonly used procedure to remove or sample pericardial effusion, and complications of this procedure are rare. This report describes a 75-year-old man with lymphoma and right ventricular perforation during pericardiocentesis for pericardial effusion. CASE REPORT A 75-year-old male patient with diffuse large B cell lymphoma was admitted with concerns of refractory chest tightness and breath shortness after physical exercise. Images from echocardiography showed massive pericardial effusion. After a comprehensive clinical assessment, pericardiocentesis was selected as the corresponding strategy, with the aim to improve the symptom of pericardial compression. However, during the procedure, it was found that the catheter was not placed into the expected location, and the right ventricle was damaged by inappropriate puncture, which led to hemopericardium. Computed tomography showed a high-density 2-mm suspected foreign body penetrating from the pericardial cavity, right ventricle to pulmonary main artery. At the same time, echocardiography showed that cardiac compression was more severe from the progressive effusion and continuous clot formation, which could lead to tamponade or even sudden cardiac arrest. Therefore, this patient immediately underwent emergent exploratory thoracotomy to drain the hemopericardium and remove the misplaced catheter, as well as to repair the damaged right ventricle. CONCLUSIONS Pericardiocentesis has risks due to the invasiveness of the procedure; hence, it is important to conduct complete and comprehensive assessments and preparations before the procedure. Once related complications are found, earlier and effective intervention, including emergent surgery, should be necessary."

The risk entailed in teaching residents during ABO surgery has not been defined or investigated in detail to date. It is the aim of this study to reveal whether surgery for ABO, performed by resident surgeons under supervision, is safe and feasible. A retrospective analysis was conducted of all emergency surgeries for ABO performed between 2009 and 2023 at a community-based hospital. Patients' general characteristics, procedural data and outcome parameters were compared. Differences between teaching procedures and non-teaching procedures were analysed. The study was conducted at the Department of General and Visceral surgery at a community-based hospital (St. John of God Hospital Salzburg, Austria). All emergency surgeries for ABO (n = 300 patients) that were performed during the study period were included. Emergency surgery for ABO was performed in 300 patients during the study period, 15.3% of which operations were performed by residents under supervision and 84.7% by senior surgeons. No differences between these two groups were found in terms of patient characteristics, except for a past medical history of previous gynecologic or urologic surgery that was more frequent in the senior surgeon group (p = 0.02). Neither procedural data nor conversion rates from a minimally invasive (MIS) to an open (OS) approach, nor postoperative complication rates were found to be significantly different between these groups. Emergency surgery for ABO, performed by residents under supervision, is safe and feasible, showing no significant differences in terms of complication rates, morbidity or mortality as compared to procedures performed by senior surgeons."

Delayed diagnosis can lead to increased morbidity and complications. A 67-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis presented with escalating right knee pain, unresponsive to increasing doses of opioids. She also reported mild abdominal discomfort. A knee X-ray was unremarkable, but an abdominopelvic CT scan revealed an incarcerated obturator hernia. Emergent laparoscopic transabdominal pre-peritoneal (TAPP) repair was performed, leading to significant postoperative improvement in her knee pain. This case highlights the unusual presentation of obturator hernia with referred knee pain, which could often be misdiagnosed as a musculoskeletal issue. The likely mechanism is obturator nerve impingement caused by the hernia, and surgical intervention successfully resolved the symptoms. Clinicians should consider obturator hernia in the differential diagnosis of unexplained knee pain, particularly in patients with risk factors like advanced age, low body weight and the female gender, to avoid delayed diagnosis and prevent serious complications."

This was an observational, analytical, and retrospective study conducted on cirrhotic patients with abdominal ascites referred to the emergency department (ED) over a 1-year period. The cirrhotic patients with ascites were divided into two groups with or without SBP. The diagnostic accuracy of MPV for detecting SBP was measured and compared with the analysis of the ascites fluid obtained by paracentesis as a gold standard procedure in the absence of any secondary causes of peritonitis. The required data were documented in a checklist. A total of 252 patients, 126 with SBP and 126 without SBP, were included in the study. The mean MPV in these patients was 8.36 ± 0.92 fL. Patients with SBP had a significantly longer duration of cirrhosis, more severe fever and abdominal pain, and higher ascites WBC and PMN counts and higher mean MPV (p<001). At the most appropriate cut-off point (i.e., 8.3 fL), MPV provided the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and the diagnostic accuracy of 69.84%, 53.97%, 60.27%, 64.15%, and 61.90%, respectively, for the diagnosis of SBP. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that MPV had an acceptable diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.677). Mean platelet volume, as a non-invasive, simple, and accessible laboratory parameter, with acceptable diagnostic accuracy in cirrhotic patients with ascites may have a predictive role in the diagnosis of SBP."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is defined as an inflammation of the appendix and is one of the most common presentations to the general surgical team. The presence of right iliac fossa pain associated with a rise in inflammatory markers raises the suspicion of appendicitis in young, healthy patients. Colitis and bowel obstruction would be considered lower down on the list of differentials. Other common differentials to take into consideration include ovarian pathology and pelvic inflammatory disease in females and diverticulitis in the other population. Investigation for these patients includes ultrasound scans, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or diagnostic laparoscopy. Imaging modality can help narrow down differentials; however, diagnostic laparoscopy can prove to be fruitful when there is diagnostic uncertainty.  Meckel's diverticulum is commonly encountered within general surgery, more so within the paediatric population. Complications include bleeding, inflammation and obstruction, although this is less common in the adult population.  We present a rare case of small bowel obstruction with the transition point noted to be at the location of a Meckel's diverticulum masquerading as possible appendicitis."

    "title": "Delayed diagnosis of pediatric bladder rupture with atypical presentation after a minor fall.",
    "abstract": "Pediatric bladder injuries, though uncommon, typically result from blunt trauma, often associated with motor vehicle collisions. While most bladder injuries are linked to pelvic fractures, this association may be less common in children due to anatomical differences. Bladder injuries are classified as extraperitoneal, intraperitoneal, or combined, with intraperitoneal injuries being rarer but more prevalent in children due to their higher abdominal bladder position. This case report discusses a rare instance of delayed intraperitoneal bladder rupture in a young child following a relatively minor fall, emphasizing diagnostic challenges. A 4-year-old female presented with new onset abdominal pain, vomiting, and subjective fever three days after a minor fall. Initial evaluation revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness, elevated creatinine, and moderate ascites on ultrasound with no gross hematuria. Despite treatment for presumed acute kidney injury, the patient's condition worsened, leading to the identification of a large posterior dome bladder rupture via cystography. Surgical repair was performed, and the patient was discharged with a full recovery after sequential removal of urinary catheters. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Intraperitoneal bladder rupture can occur in healthy children after minor trauma and may not present acutely with the classic signs of gross hematuria and peritonitis. Emergency physicians should consider this diagnosis in young children with unexplained ascites, abdominal pain, hematuria, and renal failure, even with only a remote history of minor abdominal trauma."

    "abstract": "Referrals to emergency services are frequently made for acute appendicitis and renal colic. This conundrum of patients with acute appendicitis and right ureteral stones frequently presents itself to emergency physicians. The hematological parameters of patients suffering from acute appendicitis and right ureteral stones were compared in this study. From May 2022 to April 2023 the patients who applied to emergency department were reviewed retrospectively. Of these patients, age, sex, complete blood test results including white blood cell, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein were recorded. The platelet to lymphocyte ratio and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio were calculated by dividing the platelet count by the lymphocyte, and the neutrophil count by the lymphocyte count, respectively. We used the receiver operating characteristic curves to assess the diagnostic efficacy of hematological markers. There were 106 patients in the study. The mean age of the patients was 43.83 ± 15.82 years. The significant difference was found for age, white blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, platelet to lymphocyte ratio and monocyte between groups. The white blood cell and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio have the biggest area than the other parameters in the receiver operating characteristic curves. Patients with acute appendicitis have a high level of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, platelet to lymphocyte ratio than ureteral stones. Further studies are needed to define the diagnostic efficacy of hematological markers for acute appendicitis and ureteral stones."

    "abstract": "Gallstone ileus is an uncommon cause of mechanical bowel obstruction, often presenting a diagnostic challenge due to its nonspecific symptoms and the variable presence of Rigler's triad (pneumobilia, small bowel obstruction, and ectopic gallstone). We report a case of an 80-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with a two-week history of vague abdominal pain. An initial CT scan revealed mild pneumobilia and a 2 cm calcified mass in the distal small bowel. The diagnosis of gallstone ileus was not initially apparent but was established after reviewing a previous CT scan that showed an identical large mass in the gallbladder. The patient underwent robotic exploration and enterotomy, resulting in the removal of a 4 cm gallstone. This case underscores the importance of reviewing historical imaging in diagnosing gallstone ileus. While Rigler's triad (pneumobilia, small bowel obstruction, and ectopic gallstone) is not always fully present, partial findings should raise suspicion. The unified electronic medical record (EMR) system played a crucial role in expediting the diagnosis by facilitating access to previous imaging studies. This report highlights the value of correlating current and historical imaging findings in diagnosing gallstone ileus, particularly in elderly patients with nonspecific abdominal symptoms. Future educational efforts should focus on increasing awareness of gallstone ileus among emergency physicians and radiologists, emphasizing the importance of correlating current findings with historical imaging data."

    "abstract": "Bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR), particularly multidrug resistance (MDR) in gram-negative bacterial strains, has emerged as a formidable challenge of substantial consequence, necessitating an urgent pursuit of a sustainable and efficacious strategic response. Repurposing nonantibiotic drugs as potential antibiotics or antibiotic adjuvants is a valuable approach to targeting MDR bacteria. A total of 1,750 FDA-approved drugs (APExBIO, USA) were screened to test their antimicrobial activities against MDR bacteria using the broth microdilution method according to the standard of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Microscale thermophoresis (MST) analysis was performed to detect the Fty720-LPS interactions. Fty720-indcued lipid changes were measured by untargeted lipidomic analysis. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis was used to determine the Fty720-lipid binding affinities. DNA degradation was assessed via agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide (EB) staining and visualized using a gel imaging system. Galleria mellonella larvae infection model and Mouse peritonitis infection models were used to evaluated the antibacterial ability of Fty720 in vivo. In this study, we identified Fty720, a pharmaceutical agent for treating multiple sclerosis, as a potent inhibitor of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB). We demonstrated that Fty720 exerts antibacterial effects through multiple strategies, including disruption of the structural integrity of the membranes by interacting with LPS and glycerophospholipids, as well as degradation of bacterial DNA. Furthermore, through judicious structural modification, the pivotal role of the positively charged moiety (NH2) in Fty720's antibacterial activity was substantiated. Intriguingly, the translation of Fty720's antibacterial efficacy was demonstrated in vivo, substantiating its pronounced influence on elevating survival rates among models afflicted with MDR gram-negative bacterial infections. Fty720 targets CRAB via multiple pathways, including disruption of outer and inner membrane integrity and DNA degradation. This investigation unveils the multifaceted antibacterial mechanisms of Fty720 while concurrently delineating a prospective therapeutic avenue to counteract MDR gram-negative bacterial strains."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to report a case of acute superior mesenteric artery embolism due to infective endocarditis treated with endovascular therapy. A patient with infective endocarditis was admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain, and abdominal enhanced computer tomography showed acute superior mesenteric artery embolism. He underwent urgent percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy and stenting to open the superior mesenteric artery and restore blood supply to the intestine. However, 17 days after the endovascular treatment, a pseudoaneurysm formed next to the stent, which was eventually removed by open surgery. The patient's prognosis was good at the 1 year follow-up. Endovascular treatment of acute superior mesenteric artery embolism caused by infective endocarditis was able to rapidly restore the intestinal blood supply. However, the possibility of postoperative pseudoaneurysm needs to be guarded against. This study will provide clinical treatment guidance for acute superior mesenteric artery embolism caused by infectious endocarditis. Endovascular treatment may rapidly alleviate intestinal ischemia and reduce the risk of intestinal necrosis, but it cannot completely eliminate infectious emboli, which may lead to further development of pseudoaneurysms."

    "title": "Acute Large Bowel Obstruction Post Umbilical Hernia Repair Surgery: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "While large bowel obstruction (LBO) is a less common cause of bowel obstruction, it has a broad range of differentials. Its most common etiology in the United States is colorectal adenocarcinoma. Patients usually present with diffuse abdominal pain, constipation, abdominal distension, and nausea. Abdominal X-rays can quickly assess bowel dilation, but a CT scan is the gold standard to determine the location and severity of the blockage. The treatment can range from IV fluid to emergent colectomy. A 41-year-old male with a history of bronchitis and hypertension presented for a surgical consult six days post-incarcerated umbilical hernia repair. The patient complained of nausea, diffuse abdominal distension and tenderness, and inability to pass gas. Physical examination revealed a severely distended abdomen with rebound and guarding at the lower right quadrant. CT scan showed severely dilated ascending colon and cecum along with pneumatosis. There was also an obstructing mass at the sigmoid colon. A diagnosis of severe LBO with impending perforation was made, and the patient underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy. Subtotal colectomy was done with anastomosis between the ileum and sigmoid colon. The pathology report showed an 8.0 cm dilated cecum, necrosis of the ascending colon, and diverticulitis with scar fibrosis along the wall of the colonic membrane. The patient had an ileus and kidney injury postoperatively but they subsequently resolved. Diverticulitis is historically common in the elderly population, but recent studies have shown a rising incidence among younger individuals. It is a common cause of obstruction but rarely causes severe complications like pneumatosis and perforation that require emergent surgery. When occluded, the mass and patent ileocecal valve can cause closed-loop bowel syndrome. Even though an unhealthy diet is a known trigger for diverticulitis, surgery is possibly another factor in rare cases. Patients of all ages should be educated on the symptoms of diverticular disease, and surgical monitoring is key in those with known diverticulosis."

    "abstract": "An intragastric balloon is often used as a temporary solution for weight loss. It is endoscopically placed into the stomach and filled with air or saline to encourage fullness and reduce meal intake. A 23-year-old female with a history of a gastric balloon procedure presented to the emergency department with generalized abdominal pain and recurrent vomiting. Initial imaging with ultrasound and computed tomography scans revealed a collapsed migrated gastric balloon causing a small bowel obstruction. Despite initial conservative management, the patient required surgical intervention, which involved laparoscopic exploration, mini laparotomy, and enterotomy to extract the migrated balloon. Postoperatively, the patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged with a stable condition. This case underscores the importance of considering device-related complications in patients with gastric balloons presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms and highlights the need for prompt imaging and appropriate surgical management. Intragastric balloon migration leading to small bowel obstruction is a rare but serious complication that should be considered in patients presenting with abdominal pain and vomiting following a gastric balloon procedure. Prompt imaging and surgical intervention are crucial for effective management and favorable outcomes."

We present a case of known metastatic NET manifesting as acute-on-chronic mesenteric ischemia due to the involvement of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and vein (SMV). A 63-year-old female with metastatic NET presented with acute-onset abdominal pain. The patient was hemodynamically stable but uncomfortable appearing with significant pain. Imaging demonstrated decreased enhancement of several small bowel loops within the right lower quadrant concerning for bowel ischemia with a mesenteric mass encasing the SMA and SMV. Surgical intervention revealed a nonviable loop of small bowel. Second-look laparotomy was performed with viable remaining bowel, and an ileocolic anastomosis was successfully created. Acute-onset abdominal pain in a patient with NET warrants urgent. Mesenteric ischemia, while rare, should not be overlooked, as timely diagnosis and intervention are imperative."

    "abstract": "Para-duodenal hernias make up 53 % of all internal hernias, with 40 % being left-sided and 13 % being right-sided. The occurrence of symptoms in adults is rare, ranging from 0.2 % to 0.5 %. The sex ratio for internal hernia often exhibits a male predominance, with around three males affected for every one female. Emergency operations typically result in the discovery of the right para-duodenal hernia, an uncommon internal hernia with aberrant anatomy. In this case report, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of right para-duodenal hernia. This condition poses a diagnostic challenge and requires prompt surgical management in emergency patients. A 71-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a 24-h history of intermittent abdominal pain in the abdominal region. The patient described the pain as colicky and reported experiencing nausea and vomiting. All laparotorical investigations were normal. A CT scan showed that the jejunal bowel loops were positioned incorrectly, with one below and to the right of the second part of the duodenum and the other at an incorrect angle to the duodenum-jejunal junction. We diagnosed a suspected para-duodenal hernia. An emergency operation was scheduled, and instead a diagnosis of right para-duodenal hernia was made. Following the surgery, the patient made a full recovery and received discharge within 5 days. Internal hernias are a rare and unusual type of intestinal obstruction that are defined by the small bowel becoming trapped in an abnormal intra-abdominal cavity defect. Less than 1 % and up to 6 % of all related bowel obstruction, respectively, are roughly related. In our cases, due to the late presentation of massive abdominal distention, peritonitis, and hemodynamic alterations, we preferred an explorative laparotomy, which revealed intestinal ischemia, which is trapped in the hernia sac and is not suitable for laparoscopic surgery. Although right para-duodenal hernia is a very uncommon type of para-duodenal hernia, its anatomical features can vary significantly. It is critical to increase healthcare professionals' knowledge about the illness and ensure prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention. This intervention will effectively mitigate potential problems and significantly enhance patient outcomes."

A 53-year-old male who had undergone a Hartmann's procedure for non-metastatic sigmoid colon cancer presented with bowel obstruction 10 days after attempted reversal surgery at another hospital. Imaging studies suggested an entero-colic fistula. Emergency laparotomy revealed dense adhesions and multiple bowel injuries. The procedure was terminated, and controlled fistulae were created. The patient required two months of intensive care. A subsequent surgery excised the fistulae and restored intestinal continuity, leaving the patient with an end colostomy and approximately 120 cm of ileum. This case highlights the potential risks of Hartmann's reversal and emphasizes the importance of proper patient selection, timing, and surgical expertise. It underscores the need for thorough preoperative evaluation and preparation when attempting such complex surgeries."

    "abstract": "Intestinal intussusception is an uncommon condition in adults, particularly in young females, where one segment of the intestine telescopes into an adjacent segment, leading to bowel obstruction and potential compromise of blood supply. This case report presents a rare instance of intestinal intussusception in a 25-year-old female. A 25-year-old female presented to the emergency department with severe, sudden-onset abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Physical examination revealed a soft abdomen with tenderness and rebound tenderness initially in the right upper quadrant, which later migrated to the left upper quadrant, along with leukocytosis. Imaging studies, including X-ray, ultrasound, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan, demonstrated dilated intestinal loops, a \"bowel within bowel\" appearance suggestive of intussusception, and a right appendiceal cyst. The patient underwent surgical intervention after failing to respond to initial conservative management. Adult intussusception is rare, often presenting with non-specific symptoms that can delay diagnosis and treatment. Imaging modalities, particularly CT scans, are crucial for accurate diagnosis, localizing the intussusception, identifying lead points, and guiding management. While conservative management may be considered for uncomplicated small bowel intussusceptions, surgical intervention is typically recommended for symptomatic cases, large bowel involvement, or suspected malignancy. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for intussusception in adult patients presenting with abdominal symptoms, regardless of age or gender. Early recognition through appropriate imaging, such as contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), and prompt management, including timely surgical intervention when conservative treatment fails, is essential to optimize patient outcomes in this uncommon but potentially serious condition."

    "abstract": "In developed countries, the average life expectancy has been increasing and is now well over 80 years. Increased life expectancy is associated with an increased number of emergency surgical procedures performed in later age groups. Acute appendicitis is one of the most common surgical diseases, with a lifetime risk of 8%. A growing incidence of acute appendicitis has been registered in the elderly population and in the oldest groups (> 80 years). Among patients > 50-year-old who present to the emergency department for acute abdominal pain, 15% have acute appendicitis. In these patients, emergency surgery for acute appendicitis is challenging, and some important aspects must be considered. In the elderly, surgical treatment outcomes are influenced by sarcopenia. Sarcopenia must be considered a precursor of frailty, a risk factor for physical function decline. Sarcopenia has a negative impact on both elective and emergency surgery regarding mortality and morbidity. Aside from morbidity and mortality, the most crucial outcomes for older patients requiring emergency surgery are reduction in function decline and preoperative physical function maintenance. Therefore, prediction of function decline is critical. In emergency surgery, preoperative interventions are difficult to implement because of the narrow time window before surgery. In this editorial, we highlight the unique aspects of acute appendicitis in elderly patients and the influence of sarcopenia and frailty on the results of surgical treatment."

Among 431 patients (51.7% women), mean (SD) age was 52.2 (15.8) years. AlloDerm was most used with oral cavity reconstruction (35.3%), septal perforation repair/rhinoplasty (16.5%), and parotidectomy (13.0%). Most procedures were performed in outpatient settings (hospital, 90.0%; ambulatory surgical center, 8.6%). Over 30 days, less than 1% of patients (4 of 431) required reoperation with AlloDerm; 0.5% (2 of 431) had graft-related complications. Most (75.6%) patients had an outpatient visit; few had an emergency room visit (7.9%) or inpatient claim (3.0%). Real-world evidence indicates that AlloDerm is used in head- and neck-related procedures in US adults, particularly oral reconstruction.

To report a unique case of CAP managed effectively with a drug-coated balloon, highlighting a novel application of this technology in emergency PCI. A 73-year-old male with a history of chronic angina, hypertension, and diabetes underwent PCI for severe stenosis in the mid-left anterior descending (LAD) artery. During the procedure, a large vessel CAP occurred. Immediate management included hemodynamic stabilization via fluid resuscitation and dopamine administration, followed by the deployment of drug-coated balloons instead of the conventional covered stent to seal the perforation. The intervention successfully sealed the perforation with restoration of thrombolysis in myocardial infarction 3 flow, and the patient remained hemodynamically stable. Follow-up over six months showed no adverse cardiovascular events and normal cardiac function was maintained. This case demonstrates the potential of drug-coated balloons as a feasible alternative to covered stents in managing CAP, particularly in large vessel perforations.

Incarceration during colonoscopy is a critical condition, and attempting forced reduction may exacerbate complications; therefore, a careful approach is required. Here, we present a case of colonoscopic incarceration of a left inguinal hernia that was successfully reduced under fluoroscopic guidance, followed by elective endoscopic surgery. A 74-year-old man presented for colonoscopy at a primary care clinic and was referred to our hospital for the incarceration of the colonoscope within the inguinal hernia. On arrival, the colonoscope remained in situ through the anus. Laboratory tests and imaging studies confirmed the absence of perforation. Manual pressure was applied under fluoroscopic guidance to successfully reduce the hernia and allow for scope extraction. No evidence of perforation was revealed in the follow-up fluoroscopic examination using a gastrografin enema. Six weeks later, the patient underwent definitive surgery for total extraperitoneal hernia repair. A complication of colonoscopy is the incarceration of the colonoscope within the inguinal hernia, particularly in older men. Therefore, inquiring about the patient's history of inguinal hernia, particularly those accompanied by scrotal swelling, besides assessing the surgical history before performing a colonoscopy, is critical. Furthermore, recent trends include attempts at incarceration reduction under fluoroscopic guidance, with emergency surgery reserved for irreducible cases."

Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency that can lead to severe complications if not treated promptly. The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns resulted in reduced hospital visits, potentially delaying treatment for appendicitis and increasing perioperative severity. This retrospective, bicentric cohort study included 634 adult patients who underwent emergency appendectomy at the Nancy University Hospital and Metz Regional Hospital. The study compared patients from the pandemic period (March 17, 2020, to December 14, 2020) with those from the same periods in 2018 and 2019. The primary outcome was perioperative severity, defined by a Gomes score ≥ 3 and/or a Clavien-Dindo classification ≥ 3. Secondary outcomes included time to treatment, severity of biological inflammatory syndrome, postoperative complications, and hospitalization metrics. Logistic regression analyses were performed with adjustments for ASA scores. The study included 194 patients from the COVID-19 cohort and 440 from the non-COVID cohort. The perioperative severity was higher during the COVID period (33.5% vs. 25.9%), though this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.0845). Secondary outcomes such as time to treatment, severity of the inflammatory syndrome, and postoperative complications did not show significant differences between cohorts. However, the duration of postoperative antibiotic therapy was longer during the COVID period (6 days vs. 5 days, p = 0.0410). The COVID-19 pandemic led to a non-significant increase in perioperative severity of acute appendicitis. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, the French healthcare system maintained effective management of surgical emergencies, with no significant increase in postoperative complications. Further research is required to explore the broader impact of the pandemic on the management of appendicitis."

    "abstract": "Sigmoid volvulus during pregnancy is an extremely rare condition that presents as intestinal obstruction and can lead to severe complications for both the mother and fetus if not promptly diagnosed and treated. To our knowledge, this is the first documented case in Yemen. We report a case of a 39-year-old pregnant woman at 32 weeks of gestation who presented with acute abdominal pain, constipation, and signs of peritonitis. Diagnostic imaging was limited due to the pregnancy, but an ultrasound revealed fluid collection in the pelvis and massive pneumoperitoneum, suggesting a rupture of the hollow viscus. An emergency exploratory laparotomy confirmed a perforated sigmoid volvulus with necrosis of the sigmoid wall; as a result, we resected a nonviable colon and performed Hartmann's procedure. After five days, we discharged the patient in excellent condition, and the fetus was monitored as healthy. Diagnosis of sigmoid volvulus during pregnancy is challenging due to the overlap of symptoms with normal pregnancy. Prompt surgical intervention is crucial to prevent maternal and fetal complications. This case highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach involving general surgeons, obstetricians, and neonatologists in managing this rare condition. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for improving maternal and fetal outcomes in cases of sigmoid volvulus during pregnancy."

    "abstract": "We present a case of bowel obstruction secondary to intussusception in a pregnant patient with a remote history of Roux-en-Y bypass. This patient presented with a one-day history of abrupt onset epigastric abdominal pain with associated nausea, emesis, and intolerance to oral intake. She was taken for an exploratory laparotomy after imaging suggested an internal hernia and a mass consistent with an intussusception was identified and resected. The patient later underwent a scheduled cesarean section at 38 weeks. Though bariatric surgery has been shown to reduce the risk of various conditions in pregnancy, the risk of developing complications, such as intussusception, should be considered when counseling female patients interested in bariatric surgery who may wish to become pregnant in the future. Additionally, pregnant patients with a history of bariatric surgery who present with acute abdominal pain should receive an urgent medical and surgical evaluation to rule out ischemic internal hernia or intussusception."

    "abstract": "Internal hernias are a rare entity with an incidence of 0.2%-0.9% among all hernias. Patients may present with a wide spectrum of symptoms, but strangulated para-duodenal hernias are relatively rare. We present a case of a 24-year-old male who presented with severe abdominal pain. He was diagnosed with a left para-duodenal hernia through contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis. He underwent exploratory laparotomy followed by the resection of strangulated ileal loops with ileo-ileal anastomosis. Emergency surgery is the mainstay of management, and the approach to surgery, open vs. laparoscopic, depends on the surgeon's expertise and available infrastructure. The mortality rate is high if hernias are complicated by incarceration, strangulation, or obstruction."

    "abstract": "Appendectomy is the surgical treatment for acute appendicitis and barriers to timely care can lead to morbidity and mortality. In South Africa, patients experience delays during the stages of seeking, reaching, and receiving care. This study explored the perceptions and experiences of barriers to accessing appendectomy among patients, caregivers, and surgeons employed at selected public hospitals in the Western Cape, South Africa. A qualitative study was conducted through semi-structured in-depth interviews. Study sites comprised four public hospitals. The interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and translated verbatim. Excerpts in the qualitative data were systematically categorised and themes were generated using inductive thematic analysis according to Braun and Clarke's methodology. The following themes were generated from the analysis 1) barriers related to late presentation to a healthcare facility and 2) barriers related to healthcare facility delays. Identified barriers were perceptions of appendicitis-like symptoms, the influence of beliefs, customs and culture on healthcare-seeking behaviour, personal and social positions and values, lack of knowledge of the health system, transport accessibility and affordability, delayed ambulance response time, and proximity of healthcare facilities. Key barriers experienced after presentation to a healthcare facility related to inter-facility transfers, surgical capacity, and the diagnostic and management capabilities of facilities. Participants in the study experienced, and perceived similar delays to accessing appendectomy to that reported in other African countries. Improved health literacy in communities could lead to timely healthcare-seeking behaviour for appendicitis and other emergency conditions. Efforts are needed to ensure access to affordable and available transport options, and healthcare facilities need to be better equipped to diagnose and treat appendicitis. This can be achieved through upskilling and augmenting human and other resources, which will require the support of the government and other relevant stakeholders."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a surgical emergency and the diagnosis is straightforward in majority of the cases. However, chronic appendicitis, a relatively rare cause of chronic abdominal pain, presents a unique challenge due to its atypical presentation. This rarity underscores the need for vigilance and thoroughness in our practice to avoid misdiagnosis or delay in diagnosis. We present a case of chronic appendicitis in which a 30-year-old male patient presented with a nine-month history of chronic abdominal pain with mild right lower quadrant tenderness. Abdominal ultrasound suggested a feature of appendicitis, and the patient underwent appendectomy; finally, the diagnosis was confirmed on the histopathologic exam. Chronic appendicitis, a relatively rare condition, is often diagnosed late due to a lack of well-developed diagnostic criteria and atypical presentation. However, using abdominal U/S and CT scan imaging plays a crucial role in assessing chronic appendicitis, highlighting the importance of these tools in our practice. In many cases, the ultimate diagnosis is confirmed after a histopathology exam, reinforcing the need for a comprehensive approach to diagnosis. Chronic appendicitis can have an atypical presentation with milder symptoms, and it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with chronic right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Abdominal U/S is an important imaging modality in assessing suspect cases of chronic appendicitis."

    "abstract": "Although antibiotic therapy has become the primary treatment for acute uncomplicated appendicitis, the management of acute complicated appendicitis necessitates careful consideration of various treatment options. To analyze the clinical data of patients who underwent emergency appendectomy for acute complicated appendicitis with peri-appendiceal abscess or phlegmon, identify factors influencing the postoperative length of hospital stay (LOS), and improve treatment strategies. The clinical data of acute complicated appendicitis patients with peri-appendiceal abscess or phlegmon who underwent emergency appendectomy at The Department of Emergency Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University from January 2016 to March 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 234 patients were included in our study. The duration of symptoms and the presence of an appendicolith were significantly correlated with the occurrence of peri-appendiceal abscess in patients with acute complicated appendicitis (P < 0.001 and P = 0.015, respectively). Patients with symptoms lasting longer than 72 h had a significantly longer postoperative LOS compared to those with symptoms lasting 72 h or less [hazard ratio (HR), 1.208; 95%CI: 1.107-1.319; P < 0.001]. Additionally, patients with peri-appendiceal abscesses had a significantly longer postoperative LOS compared to those with phlegmon (HR, 1.217; 95%CI: 1.095-1.352; P < 0.001). The patients with peri-appendiceal abscesses were divided into two groups based on the median size of the abscess: Those with abscesses smaller than 5.0 cm (n = 69) and those with abscesses 5.0 cm or larger (n = 82). Patients with peri-appendiceal abscesses measuring 5.0 cm or larger had a significantly longer postoperative LOS than those with abscesses smaller than 5.0 cm (P = 0.038). The duration of symptoms and the presence of an appendicolith are significant risk factors for the formation of peri-appendiceal abscesses in patients with acute complicated appendicitis. Patients with peri-appendiceal abscesses experience a significantly longer postoperative LOS compared to those with peri-appendiceal phlegmon."

Here we present a case of a 76-year-old female with chronic kidney disease and a malrotated right pelvic kidney who underwent PCNL for a 3.5 cm staghorn calculus. Postoperatively, she developed a rare complication of ascending colon perforation, requiring emergent surgical intervention including exploratory laparotomy and right hemicolectomy. Colon perforation during PCNL is rare (0.3%-0.8%). Preoperative imaging, namely computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, is crucial to identify anatomical variations and mitigate the risk of injury. Conservative management strategies have demonstrated success in similar cases, emphasizing the importance of prompt recognition and multidisciplinary management. This case contributes to the paucity of literature regarding this rare complication underscoring the necessity for detailed preoperative planning to avoid complications in PCNL, especially in patients with complex renal anatomy. Future research should focus on developing tailored guidelines for PCNL in patients with anatomical abnormalities to enhance procedural safety and optimize outcomes."

The data were obtained and used to calculate modified Alvarado, and Lintula scores. All the patients were categorized into two groups according to their histopathological results, i.e., positive appendectomy and negative appendectomy. The sensitivity and specificity of different scoring systems in diagnosing Acute appendicitis was investigated. Sensitivity and specificity of Modified Alvarado score were 89.2% and 80.0% respectively. Diagnostic accuracy of Modified Alvarado Score was 88.57%. Positive productive value and Negative productive values of this scoring tool were 98.3% and 36.3% respectively whereas, diagnostic accuracy of Lintula score was 75.0%. It can be inferred from the study that Modified Alvarado Score is a good screening tool for diagnosing need of appendectomy."

This study aimed to investigate the current usage and diagnostic performance of ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT). A national survey was conducted by a core group from The National Ultrasound Quality and Control Center of China among radiologists practicing in medical institutions equipped with emergency departments and regularly performing appendectomies. Radiologists participated by completing the survey online from August 2022 to August 2023 after reviewing medical records of at least 40 patients with suspected AA. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value and likelihood ratios were calculated for US and CT, respectively. Diagnostic performance of US between hospital subgroups were also compared. A total of 141 questionnaires were submitted and 118 were eligible, each representing a distinct hospital. A total of 1844 children and 4165 adults were included. There were 76.4% patients underwent US studies, while 23.9% underwent CT studies. Higher percentage of children underwent US studies than adults (82.2% vs. 73.9%, P = 0.000). In children, the sensitivity and specificity of US were 89% and 90%, and of CT were 90% and 48%. In adults, the sensitivity and specificity of US were 92% and 84%, and of CT were 94% and 79%. The Likelihood ratios of US were higher in specialized hospitals (children's or children's and women's hospitals) than general hospitals (34.1 vs. 6.43). US is more commonly used than CT for diagnosing AA in both adults and children. The diagnostic performance of US is comparable to CT. These findings underscore the recognition of US in clinical practice as a low-cost, non-radiative tool."

The patient was followed up without adjuvant chemotherapy. Eight months after surgery, a CT scan showed recurrence of liver metastases, and chemotherapy was started. The patient was started on regorafenib as the fourth-line therapy for multiple liver metastases, distant lymph node metastases, and peritoneal dissemination. Twenty-three days after the first course, he developed severe abdominal pain and visited the emergency department on day 25. Suspecting generalized peritonitis due to perforation of the upper gastrointestinal tract, he was treated with emergency laparotomy and drainage. A perforation was found in the anterior wall of the lower gastrointestinal body and was sutured closed. There were no adverse events, and the patient was discharged on the 21st postoperative day. regorafenib is a multi-kinase inhibitor, and gastrointestinal perforation has been reported as a serious adverse event, although it is rare.

For this reason, it is useful in the management of acute abdominal pain. Acute abdominal pain usually involves an intra-abdominal injury that requires a quick and accurate diagnosis due to the possibility of needing an urgent surgical treatment, therefore, an on-time ultrasound may be decisive. The diseases that cause acute abdominal pain and in which ultrasound provides more value are: aortic aneurysm and its complications, acute appendicitis, acute cholecystitis, renoureteral colic, acute diverticulitis and hemoperitoneum in polytraumatized patients. These diseases present easily recognizable ultrasound findings that make the diagnosis easier and help the doctor to be more confident in caring for patients with acute abdominal pain."

    "abstract": "Paraduodenal hernias are rare congenital anomalies that can lead to acute bowel obstruction and strangulation. Laparoscopic management of these complex cases in emergency settings remains challenging, particularly when bowel ischemia is present. We report a case of a 56-year-old woman presenting with acute small bowel obstruction due to a strangulated left paraduodenal hernia. Emergency laparoscopic surgery revealed ischemic bowel segments within the hernia sac. We utilized indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging to assess bowel perfusion intraoperatively, guiding our decision for bowel resection. The procedure involved hernia reduction, resection of non-viable bowel, and primary anastomosis, followed by hernia defect closure. Despite encountering a small bowel injury during reduction, we successfully completed the procedure laparoscopically. This case demonstrates the feasibility of laparoscopic management for complicated paraduodenal hernias with bowel strangulation in emergency settings. The use of ICG imaging for real-time perfusion assessment represented a novel application in this context, aiding in the precise identification of ischemic bowel segments requiring resection. Laparoscopic repair of strangulated paraduodenal hernias is feasible and effective, even in emergency scenarios. The integration of advanced imaging techniques like ICG fluorescence may enhance intraoperative decision-making, particularly in assessing bowel viability. This approach potentially reduces the extent of bowel resection and improves outcomes in these complex cases."

We retrospectively evaluated 207 lesions in 195 consecutive older patients aged ≥ 75 years who underwent ESD for colorectal tumors between January 2007 and December 2018. Outcomes of ESD were evaluated, and the prognosis was assessed in terms of both curability and the patient's baseline physical condition as determined by several indices. Cox regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with reduced overall survival (OS). Treatment outcomes included a median procedure time of 55 min, en bloc resection rate of 97%, histological en bloc resection rate of 92%, postoperative bleeding rate of 2.4%, and intraoperative perforation rate of 3.4%. Postoperative bleeding and intraoperative perforation could be treated conservatively. Delayed perforation occurred in one patient and required emergency surgery. Three-year OS was 99.4% and 5-year OS was 95.8%. Overall, three patients experienced recurrence (one local, two distant metastasis), and one patient died of primary cancer. Multivariate analysis identified the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score ≥ 3 as the only independent predictor of reduced OS (hazard ratio 4.26; 95% confidence interval 1.60-11.38; P = 0.004). Our results suggest that colorectal ESD is safe and effective in older patients aged ≥ 75 years. There was a significant independent association of reduced OS with high CCI score, but not with curability by ESD. The CCI score should be considered when determining the indications for ESD in older patients."

However, data on direct intraluminal pressure are still lacking. This study aimed to investigate sedation safety, primarily by comparing intraluminal pressure. This retrospective study included patients aged 10 years or younger, diagnosed with intussusception at a university-affiliated pediatric emergency department (ED) between July 2021 and February 2023. These patients were categorized into two groups: sedation and non-sedation. During regular working hours (from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on weekdays), patients were administered 1 mg/kg of intravenous ketamine for sedation during air enema reduction. Patients within non-working hours did not receive sedative interventions. In a study of 114 patients with intussusception (median age: 25 months), 29 (25.4%) received sedatives, and 85 (74.6%) did not. Maximum intraluminal pressure during the procedure showed no significant difference between the groups (sedation: 64 mmHg, non-sedation: 83 mmHg, p = 0.091). Bowel perforation was not observed in the overall cohort. No difference was observed in the failure rate or recurrence rate within 24 h between the two groups. Sedation with a median dose of 1 mg/kg ketamine did not cause delays in the ED process and demonstrated no adverse events while maintaining appropriate sedation depth with sequential dosing. The utilization of ketamine sedation during fluoroscopy-guided air enema reduction for pediatric intussusception was not associated with increased intraluminal pressure, increased rate of reduction failure, or bowel perforation."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the main cause of urgent abdominal surgeries performed worldwide. The disease is most prevalent in the second and third decades of life, and patients typically range in age from five to 45. One of the most common non-elective procedures performed by general surgeons, appendectomy is still the gold standard for treating acute appendicitis despite the variety of clinical presentation patterns. Our study aimed to compare the outcomes of surgically treating acute appendicitis (open versus laparoscopic) with respect to pain control, hospital stay, sepsis, and clinical improvement during the COVID-19 pandemic. This retrospective cohort study audit was conducted at the Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust. The documents maintained in the form of discharge notes, drug charts, operation notes, admission notes, and sunrise system notes. The Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust's medical ethics committee approved the study and determined that informed consent was not necessary. The patients' identities remained secret. Data from November 2019 to July 2021 was collected retroactively and analyzed using Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA). The gender ratio of patients who had laparoscopic appendectomy was nearly equal, with 21 (52%) and 19 (48%) of the patients who underwent open appendectomy being female (65% of open cases) and 14 (35%) of the cases male (open cases). The laparoscopic group had a higher overall postoperative complication rate (22% versus 18%), but the open appendectomy group had a higher rate of open wound infection. Finally, our study highlights the importance of a nuanced understanding of patient demographics and clinical presentations when comparing open and laparoscopic appendectomy, providing insightful information about the outcomes of acute appendicitis. The differences in postoperative care and complication rates highlight how difficult surgical approach decision-making can be. More investigation is necessary to determine the fundamental causes of these variations and to improve recommendations for the best possible patient care, particularly in the face of difficult medical situations like the COVID-19 pandemic."

In this case, a colo-colic intussusception involving the descending colon caused acute obstruction, ischemic pain, and carried a high risk for peritonitis, necessitating urgent surgical intervention to prevent severe complications. We report the case of a 50-year-old male who presented with acute abdominal obtruction and a three-day history of fecal vomiting, left-sided abdominal pain, and recent rectal bleeding. Imaging revealed colo-colic intussusception of the descending colon due to a colonic tumor. Immediate surgical intervention was performed with an oncologic resection of the invaginated segment, including a left hemicolectomy with lymph node dissection. A diversionary left iliac colostomy was conducted, ensuring clear resection margins and reducing the risk of postoperative complications. Intussusception in adults, while rare, frequently indicates a malignant etiology, and prompt diagnosis and management are essential. In this case, rapid surgical intervention allowed successful removal of the tumor with favorable oncologic outcomes and no recurrence at two-year follow-up. This case highlights the complexity of diagnosing intussusception in adults, where symptoms may mimic other gastrointestinal conditions and are often nonspecific. This case underscores the critical importance of early detection and intervention for intussusception in adults. Awareness among physicians should be heightened to consider intussusception in adult patients presenting with symptoms such as ischemic pain or a palpable mass with associated pain, as timely intervention can lead to improved outcomes and reduce morbidity."

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of bariatric surgery complications, including presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence. Bariatric surgeries include restrictive procedures (e.g., adjustable gastric banding, endoscopic gastric balloon insertion, and sleeve gastrectomy) and mixed restrictive and malabsorptive procedures (e.g., roux-en-y gastric bypass and duodenal switch-biliopancreatic diversion). Several complications may occur, which may be associated with severe morbidity and mortality. These complications include anastomotic/staple line leaks, small bowel obstruction and internal hernia, marginal ulceration, biliary disease, and device-specific issues. History concerning the type of surgery, when and where it was performed, prior complications, changes in weight, and systemic symptoms is essential. Many signs and symptoms are subtle, but fever, tachycardia, and persistent vomiting are concerning for a severe complication. If there is concern for a complication, emergent consultation with the bariatric surgeon is recommended (preferably the patient's surgeon). Imaging studies can assist in the evaluation, including computed tomography with oral and intravenous contrast. Resuscitation in the ED and early intervention by a bariatric surgeon provide the best opportunity to reduce morbidity and mortality for patients with intra-abdominal pathology.

Whether a delay in operative intervention impacts outcomes for pediatric patients with blunt HVI has not been investigated via analysis of multicenter databases. We queried the Trauma Quality Improvement Program database from 2016 to 2020 for patients younger than 18 years who underwent an operation of the stomach, small intestine, large intestine, or rectum within 72 hours of emergency department arrival after blunt injury. We excluded patients with solid organ injury and additional extra-intestinal abdominal or thoracic operations. Patients were categorized by the time from emergency department presentation to operating room arrival: 1 to 5, 5 to 12, 12 to 24, and 24 to 72 hours. We analyzed baseline characteristics and outcomes between groups. We identified 1,700 patients, including 147 (9%) who were operated on >24 hours after arrival. Patients with delayed operations demonstrated higher Injury Severity Scores and higher Abbreviated Injury Scale scores for the head, face, and upper extremities and were more likely to require an orthopedic operation. Patients who received a delayed operation were less likely to have full-thickness injury noted in the operating room and demonstrated longer hospital and intensive care unit stays. However, there was no difference in superficial surgical site infection (SSI), deep SSI, organ space SSI, severe sepsis, or mortality between groups. Diagnosis and operative intervention for blunt HVI may be delayed in the presence of distracting injuries and in the absence of full-thickness perforation. While these patients typically have a more severe injury profile and require longer hospital stays, they do not appear to have increased rates of SSI, sepsis, or mortality.

    "abstract": "Nonoperative management (NOM) with antibiotics alone for pediatric uncomplicated appendicitis is accepted to be safe and effective. However, the relative cost-effectiveness of this approach compared with appendectomy remains unknown. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of nonoperative vs operative management for pediatric uncomplicated acute appendicitis. A trial-based real-world economic evaluation from the healthcare sector perspective was performed using data collected from a multi-institutional nonrandomized controlled trial investigating NOM vs surgery. The time horizon was 1 year, with costs in 2023 US dollars. Ratio of costs-to-charges-based data for the initial hospitalization, readmissions, and unplanned emergency department visits were extracted from the Pediatric Health Information System. Utility data were derived from patient-reported disability days and health-related quality-of-life scores. Multiple scenarios and 1-way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses accounted for parameter uncertainty. Willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) or disability-adjusted life year. Primary outcome measures included total and incremental mean costs, QALY, disability-adjusted life year, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Of 1,068 participants, 370 (35%) selected NOM and 698 (65%) selected urgent laparoscopic appendectomy. Operative management cost an average of $9,791 per patient and yielded an average of 0.884 QALYs, whereas NOM cost an average of $8,044 per patient and yielded an average of 0.895 QALYs. NOM was both less costly and more effective in base case and scenario analyses using disability days and alternate methods of calculating uses. NOM is cost-effective compared with laparoscopic appendectomy for pediatric uncomplicated appendicitis for 1 year."

Moreover, the associated massive bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract results in a very high mortality rate. In this report, we describe a successful experience in using a Foley catheter to save a patient's life. A 46-year-old man was admitted for an infected thoracic aortic aneurysm with dissection. Seven days after admission, emergency thoracic aortic stent graft insertion was performed due to esophageal perforation of the thoracic aortic aneurysm. Three hours after starting surgery, a diagnosis of continuous fresh blood hematemesis and an acute exacerbation of an AEF associated with an infected thoracic aortic aneurysm was established. The patient's blood pressure was no longer maintained due to massive bleeding. We temporarily placed a Foley catheter in the middle esophagus. Hemostasis with a Foley catheter was temporary and stopped the bleeding out of the body. The patient required intensive care to control the bleeding into the left thoracic cavity, and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation had to be instituted for the worsening oxygenation. Increased intra-esophageal pressure due to balloon tamponade was considered a possible postoperative complication. The patient faced several complications and challenges during the intraoperative management, but a prompt response to these complications and challenges saved the patient's life. The efficacy of a Foley catheter in rapidly and effectively responding to active bleeding in critical settings was reaffirmed as a crucial aspect of life-saving procedures."

Computed tomography revealed that the proximal jejunum had herniated through the esophageal hiatus into the left thoracic cavity, with dilation of the subcutaneous gastric tube and duodenum. He was urgently admitted, and a nasogastric tube was inserted. His respiratory and circulatory parameters were normal upon admission, however, nine hours after admission, there was a rapid increase in oxygen demand, and he subsequently developed shock. His blood pressure was 106/65 mmHg, pulse rate of 150bpm, respiratory rate of 30/min with an O2 saturation of 97% on High-flow nasal cannula FiO2:0.4, cyanosis and peripheral coldness appeared. Chest X-ray showed a severe mediastinal shift to the right, suggesting obstructive shock due to intestinal hernia into the thoracic cavity. Emergency surgery was planned, but shortly after endotracheal intubation, the patient experienced cardiac arrest. It was found that approximately 220 cm of small intestine had herniated into the thoracic cavity through the esophageal hiatus, and it was being strangulated by the diaphragmatic crura. A portion of the diaphragmatic crura was incised to manually reduce the herniated small intestine back into the abdominal cavity. The strangulated intestine was congested, but improvement in coloration was observed and it had not become necrotic. The procedure finished with closure of the esophageal hiatus. Intensive care was continued, but he died on postoperative day 29 because of complications including perforation of the descending colon and aspiration pneumonia. Rapid progression of small intestine hernia into the thoracic cavity, leading to obstructive shock, was suspected. While this case was rare, early recognition of the condition and prompt reduction could have potentially led to life-saving outcomes."

    "abstract": "A woman in her early 60s presented to the emergency room with worsening pain 10 days after an injury to her right abdomen. CT revealed a large subcutaneous haematoma and contained small bowel perforation. She was tachycardic and anaemic and her international normalized ratio (INR) was 2.6 on warfarin for atrial fibrillation. General surgery was consulted and percutaneous drainage of the perforation was recommended, requiring an INR of 1.5 or less. Intravenous (IV) phytonadione was administered to accelerate the lowering of INR; however, the patient developed a severe infusion-related reaction. She recovered once IV phytonadione was stopped and oral diphenhydramine was administered. However, there was still a need for warfarin reversal therapy. A 1.25 mg dose of oral phytonadione was trialled 2.5 hours later and well tolerated. An additional rechallenge of 5 mg by mouth was given without reaction (<8 hours after the initial reaction). Her INR was 1.5 the next morning."

    "title": "Unexpected peritoneal metastases diagnosed at the time of primary colon cancer resection: controversies regarding options for management.",
    "abstract": "Peritoneal metastases synchronously occurring in the patient with primary colon cancer causes that patient to be at high risk for subsequent disease progression within the abdomen and pelvis. If peritoneal metastases are preoperatively diagnosed, patients are likely to be treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without biological therapy prior to cytoreductive surgery (CRS). However, if one only considers patients with peritoneal metastases unexpectedly identified at the time of primary colon cancer resection, the optimal management strategy is neither standardized nor evidence based. These authors present an opinion regarding treatment options in unexpectedly (incidentally) detected peritoneal metastases. The primary colon cancer may be asymptomatic (elective list) or may present as an emergency with obstruction or with perforation. The fitness of the patient, the condition of the colon, availability of a colonic stent, consent of the patient and capabilities of the institution for management of peritoneal metastases by CRS and intraperitoneal chemotherapy cannot be ignored and must all be considered. These patients with known peritoneal metastases should not be allowed to return for further treatment with advanced disease after multiple regimens of systemic chemotherapy. Delay in definitive management will cause peritoneal metastases to be unresectable and not amenable to cure. It is time to debate optimal management strategies for unexpectedly detected peritoneal metastases. The authors find the data compelling that the modifications presented in the management of unexpected peritoneal metastases documented at the time of colon cancer resection changes a palliative approach to treatment to a plan that has curative intent."

    "title": "Pediatric Ovarian Torsion in an 8-year Old Girl; A Case Report Study.",
    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion in children causes abdominal pain. The clinical symptoms resemble other abdominal diseases, such as appendicitis. It happens when the ovary twists on its ligamentous attachment, which stops blood from getting to the ovary. A fast diagnosis accompanied by a high level of clinical suspicion and immediate surgical intervention is obligatory to save the ovaries and avoid complications. In this case study, we describe a case of ovarian torsion in an 8-year-old Iranian girl who came with persistent (non-colicky) right-side abdominal pain. After ultrasonographic examinations, she was identified with an enlarged heterogeneous right ovary indicative of ovarian torsion and underwent emergency laparotomy without oophorectomy. It may be challenging to determine the source of abdominal pain in pediatric patients, due to factors such as insufficiently comprehensive medical histories and examinations, limitations in con-ducting radiological procedures, as well as the comparatively diminished specificity of results in contrast to adult populations. If torsion is confirmed by ultrasonography, detorsion with\\ without oophorectomy is advised for conservative treatment. This article presents a case study and a brief examination of the issues and complications associated with the identification and management of pediatric ovarian torsion."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous isolated celiac artery dissection (SICAD) is a rare phenomenon with an unclear pathogenesis. It is more common in men, with a predilection for those in their 50s. A 39-year-old woman with epigastric and back pain visited our emergency department (ED). She had no cardiovascular risk factors. On her first visit to the ED, no signs of peritonitis were noted, and her vital signs were normal. Although a non-contrast abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, the cause of her abdominal pain remained unidentified. Due to persistent mild-to-severe pain, the patient visited our ED again the following day. Despite repeated blood tests showing no abnormalities, we considered that her abdominal pain was of vascular origin. We performed a contrast-enhanced CT scan, which revealed poor contrast enhancement in the celiac artery without intestinal ischemia. Based on the medical history and CT findings, the patient was diagnosed with SICAD. We consulted a cardiovascular surgeon who advised conservative management. The patient was discharged on the 10th day after admission, and no recurrence of abdominal pain was reported. SICAD is a rare but potentially serious condition that can also occur in younger women. While certain risk factors for SICAD have been identified, some young patients may not have traditional risk factors. Physicians should consider SICAD as a differential diagnosis even in young women when their abdominal pain is persistent without other organ-specific signs."

    "abstract": "Growing evidence supports the success of nonoperative management (NOM) for pediatric adhesive small bowel obstruction (A-SBO). However, there is concern that patients with nonadhesive SBO (NA-SBO) will have repeat episodes of SBO if not treated with surgery upfront. We examined whether NOM of NA-SBO at initial presentation was associated with increased risk of recurrent SBO. A single-center observational study was performed using Current Procedural Terminology/International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes and chart review. NA-SBO was defined as SBO in a patient with no history of SBOs, prior abdominal surgeries, or congenital gastrointestinal abnormalities known to cause SBO. We excluded patients with incarcerated hernias and tumors. The independent variable was surgical treatment at initial SBO admission and primary outcome was SBO recurrence within 1 y. Our cohort included 97 patients, with 30 patients (31%) undergoing surgery at initial NA-SBO admission. There was no difference in rates of recurrent SBO within 1 y when comparing the operative versus nonoperative management groups (6.7% versus 8.9%, P = 0.70). Among patients who recurred, there was no difference in need for surgical intervention (2/6 versus 0/2, P = 0.34). None of the operations for recurrence were urgent or emergent. Patients managed nonoperatively had a shorter median length of stay (2 versus 7 d, P < 0.001) and did not have significantly more emergency room visits (10.4% versus 6.7%, P = 0.55). NOM of NA-SBO was not associated with increased rates of SBO recurrence, and NOM did not lead to increased morbidity. Surgeons should consider NOM in stable pediatric patients who present with NA-SBO."

    "abstract": "We sought to determine if there was a relationship between skin management and surgical site infections (SSIs) among patients undergoing a laparotomy for emergency general surgery (EGS). We hypothesize that skin closure technique is not associated with SSI. We performed a retrospective review of adult patients (>18 y) who underwent an exploratory laparotomy for EGS conditions within 6 h of surgical consultation from 2015 to 2019. Patients whose fascia was not closed during the index operation were excluded. Patients were divided into groups: open skin (OS) and closed skin (CS). OS included negative pressure wound therapy or wet-to-dry gauze; CS included closure with staples or sutures. Our primary outcome was the rate of SSI. The cohort comprised 388 patients: 42.3% OS (n = 164) and 57.7% CS (n = 224). The OS group had greater rates of systemic inflammatory response syndrome [SIRS] (54.9% versus 27.7%, P < 0.0001), hollow viscus perforation [HVP] (71.3% versus 20.5%, P < 0.0001), and peritoneal drains (51.2% versus 17.9%, P < 0.0001). Rates of OS management increased as wound class severity increased (0% [I] versus 12.2% [II] versus 15.9% [III] versus 72% [IV], P < 0.0001). The SSI rate for the cohort was 3.6% (n = 14); there was no difference in SSI rates (2.7% versus 4.9%, P = 0.3) between the CS or OS groups. Median length of stay was longer for the OS group (10 d versus 6.5 d, P < 0.0001). Independent predictors of OS management were SIRS (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-2.93, P = 0.04), HVP (aOR 2.03, 95% CI 1.09-3.8, P = 0.03), and class III/IV wounds (aOR 8.65, 95% CI 4.43-16.89, P < 0.0001). OS management occurs more often in patients with SIRS, HVP, and dirty wounds after EGS laparotomies. However, we found no difference in SSI between groups, suggesting that skin closure can be considered in contaminated or dirty wounds."

    "abstract": "Unplanned reoperation (URO) and unplanned hospital readmission (UHR) are key quality indicators used to assess healthcare quality improvement. The aim of this study was to describe, quantify, analyze and compare both indicators in a Pediatric Surgery Department. An observational study was conducted reviewing the medical records of pediatric patients who underwent unplanned reoperation and unplanned hospital readmission over a six-year period in a pediatric surgical unit. The incidence, indications, and causes of reoperations and readmissions were analyzed. A total of 6,376 surgeries were performed over a six-year period. During this time, there were 37 (0.58%) URO and 20 (0.31%) UHR. There were 23/2,437(0.94%) URO and 14/2,437(0.57%) UHR among emergency surgeries. In contrast, there were 14/3,939(0.35%) URO and 6/3,939(0.15%) UHR among elective surgeries (p < 0.05). Outpatient surgeries had 3/1,639 (0.18%) URO and 1/1,639 (0.06%) UHR compared to inpatient surgeries that had 11/2,300(0.47%) URO and 5/2,300 (0.21%) UHR respectively (p = ns). A total of 1,570 appendectomies were performed during the study period, with 8/1,570(0.5%) patients requiring either a URO or a UHR. The most frequent indication for both URO and UHR were intra-abdominal infections. The main cause of URO was a technical error during surgery (70%), while the main cause of UHR was an error in the medical treatment (35%). In our practice, URO are more frequent than UHR. Emergency surgeries have a higher risk of undergoing an URO or a UHR. Acute appendicitis is the most common diagnosis associated with the need for an URO or a UHR. The majority of unplanned reoperation cases are due to technical errors during surgery."

    "abstract": "Abdominal pain remains a top chief complaint for patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). Benign or emergent etiologies can present similarly. A thorough history and physical examination are critical for emergency physicians, especially for post-operative patients with concerns for a possible bowel perforation. Hysteroscopies with myomectomies are a minimally invasive surgical technique to remove fibroids. Gynecologic procedures historically have a low incidence of bowel perforation, however, in patients with post-operative pain presenting to the ED, distinguishing between a normal post-operative course and a post-operative complication can be challenging. A 33-year-old female with a history of obesity, colitis, type II diabetes, and hypertension presented to the freestanding ED with complaints of severe lower abdominal following a hysteroscopy with myomectomy earlier that day. The initial differential diagnosis had concern for a surgical complication, although her computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed mildly dilated loops of small bowel, suggestive of a low-grade small bowel obstruction (SBO) or enteritis. On reassessment, she noted pre-operative diarrhea after taking antibiotics. After admission, a transvaginal ultrasound revealed a collection of fluid in her pelvis prompting a diagnostic laparoscopy. Two enterotomies in her ileum with two uterine defects were successfully repaired, and she recovered several days later with minimal complications. This patient initially presented with abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting following a hysteroscopy with myomectomy, where initial testing led to a possible diagnosis of enteritis. Due to her continued abdominal pain, the ED physician admitted the patient, and it was found that she had two ileum perforations from suspected uterine perforations."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction (SBO) remains the most common diagnosis encountered by general surgeons, with 70% of cases related to adhesions from previous abdominal surgeries. Less common etiologies include Crohn's disease, gallstone ileus, and Meckel's diverticulum (MD). While MD is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract, it is less frequently considered as a cause in adults. Nonetheless, it remains crucial to consider MD as a potential cause of SBO in adults, especially when evaluating patients with unexplained SBO and recurrent idiopathic abdominal pain, especially in those without a history of abdominal surgery. We present a case of a 74-year-old male presenting with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, constipation, and bilious vomiting, with a presumed diagnosis of SBO and perforation, potentially attributed to MD. This case highlights the differential challenges posed by small bowel diverticula and their complications, underscoring the need for vigilance in recognizing these complications and optimizing clinical management."

    "abstract": "Chilaiditi syndrome is a rare disease that has ultimate clinical significance as it can result in misdiagnosis and serious consequences. A 65-year-old male patient presented to our hospital with sudden onset of severe, crampy peri-umbilical abdominal pain of 12 h duration. This patient was referred to our hospital for surgical intervention as the patient was misdiagnosed to have generalized peritonitis. However, upon our evaluation, the patient had no sign of peritonitis, and the abdominal X-ray showed features of the Chilaiditi sign complicated with small bowel obstruction. On that account, Chilaiditi syndrome was diagnosed, and the patient successfully managed non-operatively. Chilaiditi syndrome is clinical features caused by hepatodiaphragmatic bowel interposition. It tends to occur in male elders and commonly involves a colon. In this case, however, a small bowel was also involved and even resulted in its obstruction, which is extremely rare. Chilaiditi syndrome has a radiologic finding that has similarities with that of a bowel perforation. As a result of these, they are commonly misinterpreted as pneumoperitoneum, and the patient can be subjected to a preventable laparotomy. Nevertheless, Chilaiditi's air under the diaphragm has distinctive radiological features, and there will not be peritonitis signs unless the entrapped bowel is strangulated. Chilaiditi syndrome is a benign condition that doesn't need a laparotomy unless it is complicated. However, it should be remembered that air under the diaphragm of a bowel perforation is surgical emergency and needs to be ruled out."

    "abstract": "Calciphylaxis, also known as calcific uremic arteriolopathy, is a rare and severe condition that predominantly affects individuals with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). It manifests through vascular calcifications that precipitate tissue necrosis, with cutaneous manifestations being common. However, gastrointestinal involvement is an infrequent but gravely serious occurrence. In this report, we present an atypical case of gastrointestinal (GI) calciphylaxis in a 66-year-old woman undergoing peritoneal dialysis. The patient's initial symptoms of abdominal pain and turbid peritoneal fluid raised suspicions of bacterial peritonitis. Despite therapeutic interventions, the patient's condition deteriorated. Computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed a perforation in the caecal wall, necessitating emergency surgical intervention. Histopathology post-surgery confirmed the diagnosis of GI calciphylaxis. The patient's postoperative trajectory was fraught with complications, ultimately leading to a fatal outcome. This case highlights the importance of vigilance for calciphylaxis in the differential diagnosis when abdominal pain develops in patients with ESKD, regardless of the presence of typical skin symptoms. Prompt detection and an integrated care approach are essential for improved prognosis. Further research is needed to find more efficacious treatments for this devastating illness."

The presence of the gallbladder within a PSH is a rare and unusual occurrence, posing a significant management challenge for surgeons once encountered. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the management and outcomes of parastomal gallbladder herniations. A comprehensive search was performed across the PubMed, Embase, and Medline databases using the search terms \"gallbladder\" AND \"parastomal hernia.\" Additionally, a reference check of the results was conducted to identify further case reports. Eighteen case reports were included in the review. The mean age of the reported cases was 77.2 years, with a female predominance of 88.9% (n = 16). Seventy-seven percent (n = 14) of patients had an original ileal stoma or conduit. The average duration from stoma placement to clinical presentation was 5.8 years and abdominal pain was the most common presenting complaint. CT imaging was the most frequently utilised modality for successful diagnosis, with only two herniations identified during surgical exploration. Notably, 66.6% (n = 12) of patients experienced associated gallbladder complications, including cholecystitis, torsion, incarceration, and even perforation, all of which necessitated cholecystectomy. Cholecystic parastomal herniation is a rare phenomenon that should be considered in differential diagnoses for similar presentations. Currently, no standardized classification or management approach exists. Based on our findings, we propose classifying gallbladder herniations into two categories: simple (without inflammatory sequelae) and complicated (with cholecystitis, gallbladder torsion, incarceration, or perforation). Simple herniations may be managed electively with intraoperative reduction of the gallbladder. In contrast, complicated herniations presenting during acute admissions require emergency surgical intervention, involving a combined cholecystectomy and PSH repair."

Splenic flexure volvulus is the least common location for colonic volvulus, accounting for <1 % of cases. A 41-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with a history of crampy abdominal pain, abdominal distension and failure to pass feces and flatus of three days duration. He had a history of laparotomy 1 year back, at which time de-rotation of the splenic flexure was done. This time, while preparing the patient for emergency laparotomy, he passed both feces and flatus. On the same admission, he was operated and left hemicolectomy and end to end anastomosis was done. Due to splenic flexure attachments to the left upper quadrant via Splenic ligament splenic flexure colonic volvulus is very rare. Risk factors include congenitally absent ligaments, congenital bands, acquired adhesions, previous colonic surgery. With the appropriate clinical setting radiographic diagnosis is suggested when there is a markedly dilated, air-filled colon with an abrupt termination at the anatomic splenic flexure, two widely separated air- fluid levels, and an empty descending and sigmoid colon. Following adequate resuscitation urgent exploratory laparotomy is recommended in splenic flexure volvulus.

Data on the acute management of adult corrosive injuries from sub-Saharan Africa is scarce, with international investigative algorithms, relying heavily on computed tomography (CT), having limited availability in this setting. To investigate the corrosive injury spectrum in a low-resource setting and the applicability of parameters for predicting full-thickness (FT) necrosis and mortality. A retrospective analysis of a prospective corrosive injury registry (March 1, 2017-October 31, 2023) was performed to include all adult patients with acute corrosive ingestion managed at a single, academic referral centre in Cape Town, South Africa. Patient demographics, corrosive ingestion details, initial investigations, management, and short-term outcomes were described using descriptive statistics while multivariate analysis with receiver operator characteristic area under the curve graphs (ROC AUC) were used to identify factors predictive of FT necrosis and 30-day mortality. One-hundred patients were included, with a mean age of 32 years (SD: 11.2 years) and a male predominance (65.0%). The majority (73.0%) were intentional suicide attempts. Endoscopy on admission was the most frequent initial investigation performed (95 patients), while only 17 were assessed with CT. Seventeen patients had full thickness necrosis at surgery, of which eleven underwent emergency resection and six were palliated. Thirty-day morbidity and mortality were 27.0% and 14.0%, respectively. Patients with full thickness necrosis and those with an established perforation had a 30-day mortality of 58.8% and 91.0%, respectively. Full thickness necrosis was associated with a cumulative 2-year survival of only 17.6%. Multivariate analyses with ROC AUC showed admission endoscopy findings, CT findings, and blood gas findings (pH, base excess, lactate), to all have significant predictive value for full thickness necrosis, with endoscopy proving to have the best predictive value (AUC 0.850). CT and endoscopy findings were the only factors predictive of early mortality, with CT performing better than endoscopy (AUC 0.798 vs 0.759). Intentional corrosive injuries result in devastating morbidity and mortality. Locally, early endoscopy remains the mainstay of severity assessment, but referral for CT imaging should be considered especially when blood gas findings are abnormal."

It should be emphasized that the rupture occurred in an unexpected situation. The transesophageal echocardiography-guided removal led to the immediate identification of the cardiac tamponade and consequent survival. Ventricular rupture due to Impella implantation is likely to occur under several conditions: the use of Impella 5.5, friable ventricular wall structure, and the proximity of the device tip to the wall structure. In cases with these factors, extra caution must be observed during the insertion and removal of the device as these entail a greater risk of ventricular injury."

    "abstract": "Complications related to the peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter are the primary cause of treatment failure in PD, and bladder perforation is a rare complication of PD catheter placement. To date, there have been no reported cases of bladder perforation occurring during laparoscopic PD catheter placement. An 80-year-old woman was admitted to Shaoxing Second Hospital due to a decade-long history of high blood creatinine levels. She was diagnosed with end-stage renal disease and underwent laparoscopic PD catheter placement. On the third day post-operation, she experienced frequent urination and urgency during her initial peritoneal dialysis fluid exchange. The urine analysis indicated sterility. Both ultrasound and computed tomography scans suggested that the PD catheter was positioned in the bladder. We suspect a bladder perforation following laparoscopic placement of the PD catheter. The patient underwent emergency surgery, during which the PD catheter was removed and subsequently replaced using laparoscopy. Additionally, due to a bladder perforation, peritoneal dialysis was temporarily suspended for 10 days postoperatively. On the 11th postoperative day, the patient underwent a low-dose peritoneal dialysis, and the procedure was uneventful. During laparoscopy, PD catheter placement still carries the risk of rare complications such as bladder perforation. If postoperative PD catheter patients experience urinary urgency and frequency, there should be a high suspicion of bladder perforation. Early diagnosis and surgical intervention are crucial for improving patient prognosis."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to analyze the clinical data of patients who received conservative treatment for acute complicated appendicitis with peri-appendiceal abscess, identify factors influencing the success rate, and improve treatment strategies. The clinical data of acute complicated appendicitis patients with peri-appendiceal abscess who received conservative treatment at the Department of Emergency Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, from January 2016 to March 2023, were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 80 patients were included in our study. Patients were divided into two groups based on the outcomes of ultrasound-guided drainage: The Drainage group (n=28) and the Antibiotic group (n=52). The baseline characteristics of the two groups were comparable. In the Antibiotic group, the surgery rate was 30.4% for patients with an appendicolith and 6.9% for those without. In the Drainage group, the surgery rate was 33.3% for patients with an appendicolith and 27.3% for those without. The presence of an appendicolith significantly correlated with the need for surgery in the Antibiotic group (P=0.026), but not in the Drainage group (P=0.771). For patients who underwent surgery, the incidence of surgical site infections did not differ significantly (P=0.656), and the median length of postoperative hospital stay was similar between the groups (4.0 days vs. 3.0 days, P=0.337). The presence of an appendicolith is a risk factor for the failure of antibiotic therapy alone in acute complicated appendicitis patients with peri-appendiceal abscess. However, it does not affect the surgical rate in those who underwent successful drainage."

    "abstract": "Esophageal perforation from endoscopic dilation is rare (0.53-0.6% incidence) but serious, with mortality rates of 12.5-20%. Optimal treatment is debated and depends on the medical facility's capabilities, the patient's symptoms, the extent of perforation, and the severity of associated lesions. Treatment options include medical management (fasting, antibiotics), esophageal stenting, surgical closure, or emergency esophagectomy. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to reduce mortality and hospital stay. A 49-year-old male with lower third esophageal cancer (stage cT1aN0M0) underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and developed esophageal stenosis. Dilation attempts led to esophageal perforation, necessitating emergency esophagectomy with gastric conduit reconstruction. The patient improved and was discharged on day 10 post-operation without complications. Managing esophageal perforation post-endoscopic dilation is complex. This case highlights the importance of rapid recognition and intervention. Esophageal dilation, while effective for stenosis, carries a perforation risk. Treatment decisions must be tailored to individual patients, considering perforation severity, patient's health, and facility resources. Here, severe perforation and clinical condition warranted emergency esophagectomy. The successful outcome underscores the efficacy of this surgical intervention when performed timely at specialized centers. Emergency esophagectomy with gastric conduit reconstruction for treating esophageal perforation due to stenosis post-endoscopic submucosal dissection for esophageal cancer is considered a safe procedure and can be performed at an experienced esophageal surgery center."

    "abstract": "The incidence rate of superior mesenteric artery embolism (SMAE) is low and its mortality rate is high due to its rapid onset and progression. Due to its clinical manifestations being similar to other acute abdominal diseases, such as gastrointestinal perforation, acute appendicitis and acute pancreatitis, its misdiagnosis rate can reach 75-90%. Reducing the mortality rate of this disease is dependent upon an early diagnosis and timely surgical intervention. In the present case report, the diagnosis and treatment process of a female patient aged 83 years with SMAE were reported. The patient recovered well following timely and effective intervention. The patient was admitted due to acute abdominal pain, and computed tomography angiography (CTA) examination showed filling defect in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). The patient was diagnosed with SMAE and underwent emergency surgical treatment for a thrombectomy and thrombolysis of the SMA under general anesthesia. After surgery, recanalization of the SMA was achieved. The patient was followed up six months later, and SMA CTA revealed that the main trunk and branches of the SMA were well visualized. In addition, relevant literature was reviewed to improve the understanding and treatment of SMAE among clinicians. If patients experience severe abdominal pain that cannot be relieved by antispasmodic drugs, SMAE should be suspected. Patients with history of atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease and atherosclerosis need further examination. At present, there is a lack of highly sensitive and specific serological indicators. CTA can provide a diagnosis with high sensitivity and specificity."

We present the case of a patient diagnosed with transverse colon neoplasm and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, who presented to the Emergency Room (ER) of the Emergency County Clinical Hospital, Craiova, Romania, with a clinical picture of low intestinal occlusion. Surgery was decided and a right hemicolectomy extended to the left, with terminal ileostomy performed. The postoperative evolution was favorable, with the resumption of intestinal transit and discharge on the third postoperative day. The patient returned to the ER Department on the fifth day after surgery, with diffuse abdominal pain, absence of intestinal transit and flatulence. Clinical examination of the abdomen revealed the presence of bloating sounds on palpation. Emergency laparotomy was again performed with the suspicion of postoperative occlusion and five perforations were found in the small bowel, associated with fecaloid peritonitis and mechanic-inflammatory occlusion. The perforations were without any obvious lesion substrate, four of them being located on the jejunum and one on the terminal ileum. The histopathological examination revealed hemorrhage and recent transmural thrombosis on the intestinal wall, most likely caused by COVID-19. Without any respiratory symptoms, the COVID-19 infection caused multiple intestinal lesions, leading to peritonitis and septic shock, followed by the patient's death."

    "abstract": "It is often recommended that, in children with bilateral epistaxis, only one side of the nasal septum should be cauterised at a time in order to reduce the risk of septal perforation. This advice may have been reasonable when hot wire electrocautery was in common use. The risk of septal perforation after silver nitrate cautery is unknown but probably low. Retrospective case note review of children attending the nurse-led epistaxis clinic between 2019 and 2022. Nine hundred and twenty children were seen in the nurse-led clinic between January 2019 and December 2022. Six hundred and one children (79%) underwent nasal cautery. Simultaneous bilateral nasal cautery was carried out in 176 (29%) children. Our follow up period ranged between 303 and 1744 days, with a median of 809.5 days. No child presented to emergency or ENT services with septal perforation or any other complication of simultaneous bilateral nasal cautery. To the author's knowledge, this is the largest study assessing the safety of simultaneous bilateral nasal cautery with silver nitrate in children. No adverse results have been found after cauterising both sides of the septum at the same sitting, and doing so potentially saves time and money for patients and the health service."

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a severe gastrointestinal emergency in very preterm infants (VPIs, gestational age less than 32 weeks). The relationship between maternal HDP and NEC is controversial. Objective To investigate the association between maternal HDP and NEC in VPIs.This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study based on the data from the Chinese Neonatal Network (CHNN) which were collected between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2021. Preterm infants born between 24+0 and 31+6 weeks of gestation were divided into HDP and no-HDP groups according to the 2015 Chinese guidelines for HDP. The primary outcome was the incidence of Bell's stage II or higher NEC. Secondary outcomes included mortality and spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP). Of 27,660 women were included in the study analysis, 5405 (19.5%) were HDP and 22256 (80.5%) were no-HDP. NEC occurred in 5.2% (283/5,404) among HDP mothers and 5.3% (1,191/22,256) among no-HDP mothers. No significant association was observed between HDP and Bell's stage II or higher NEC (aOR 0.87, 95% CI [0.72, 1.05]). However, even after adjustment, maternal HDP appeared to be protective for NEC requiring surgical intervention (aOR 0.60, 95% CI [0.43, 0.83]). There was no significant correlation between maternal HDP and neonatal mortality and SIP. Maternal HDP was not significantly associated with the incidence of Bell's stage II or higher NEC. However, it was associated with the lower rate of NEC requiring surgical intervention."

A 42-year-old female with polycystic kidney disease and chronic kidney disease stage III presented with severe abdominal pain, fever, and inability to tolerate oral intake. The patient was a previous smoker who smoked 0.5 packs per day for 25 years. Initial evaluation revealed leukocytosis and elevated creatinine. A CT scan identified pneumoperitoneum and mild sigmoid diverticulitis, suggesting a perforated viscus. She underwent urgent exploratory laparotomy, which confirmed the CT findings and resulted in an appendectomy, sigmoid colon resection, and ostomy creation. Postoperatively, the patient faced complications, including recurrent pneumoperitoneum and subcutaneous emphysema, detected through follow-up CT scans, leading to further surgical interventions. CT imaging was pivotal in diagnosing, monitoring, and guiding treatment, with noncontrast CT being beneficial given her renal impairment. Early diagnosis and CT imaging are crucial in managing complicated diverticulitis. Postoperative monitoring with CT scans is essential for detecting complications. Follow-up care should include regular colonoscopies to assess diverticular disease and dietary modifications to prevent recurrence. Combining clinical, surgical, and radiologic data ensures effective management and improves patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Transomental hernia (TOH) is an extremely rare clinical condition that represents 1-4% of all internal hernias. Spontaneous TOH occurs in patients with no history of surgery or previous abdominal trauma. It happens after protrusion of the abdominal viscera, commonly the small bowel loops through a defect on the great omentum. We present a case of occlusion due to TOH in a 66-year-old man who underwent a laparotomy, and operative exploration showed 10 cm of small bowel incarcerated through a defect in the right side of the greater omentum of 4 cm in diameter. The diagnosis is usually delayed because symptoms are nonspecific. Postoperative morbidity and mortality are important because patients present most frequently with gangrenous bowel, making morbidity and mortality higher. Therefore, it constitutes a critical surgical emergency and must be quickly recognized and managed. Computed tomography (CT) scan plays a prominent role in diagnosis. Midline laparotomy is the main emergency approach for patients with unknown bowel obstruction. Some authors suggest a laparoscopic approach, but it requires a surgeon's experience and propitious patient's conditions. TOH is the rarest type of internal hernia with extremely difficult preoperative diagnosis due to nonspecific semiology. This type of hernia has the highest morbidity and mortality rates of all internal hernias. Thus, it must be suspected whenever there is bowel obstruction of unknown origin and quickly managed."

However, when complicated by perforation, phlegmon, and/or abscess formation, the standard and traditional treatment with the approach for a surgical intervention has been questioned regarding its risks and benefits. In this case presentation, our patient, who presented with perforated appendicitis complicated by phlegmon formation and ileus, was managed with a conservation approach through antibiotics and percutaneous drain placement. Although a conservative, non-surgical approach with interval appendectomy has become more of the popular approach in developed countries for complicated appendicitis due to increased morbidity in immediate appendectomy due to inflammation-associated adhesions, we wanted to present a case where a conservative approach can still lead to extended hospital stays due to complications."

    "abstract": "A Japanese female patient underwent a living lung transplant at age 29 and has been on immunomodulatory drug therapy since then. At age 52, she presented with sudden hematochezia. Despite abdominal computed tomography scan, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and colonoscopy, no definitive source of bleeding was identified. Considering the possibility of small bowel bleeding, video capsule endoscopy was performed, which revealed a suspected ulcerative lesion in the jejunum. Subsequent per-oral double-balloon endoscopy confirmed the presence of an ulcerative lesion in the jejunum. A potential pathological diagnosis of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) was considered based on endoscopic biopsy specimens from the jejunal lesion. However, before the pathologic biopsy results were available, the patient experienced small intestinal perforation, necessitating emergency partial resection. Pathologic examination revealed a dense proliferation of medium-to-large atypical lymphocytes with neutrophilic infiltration in the perforated area of the small intestinal wall. Immunostaining showed lymphoid cells positive for CD20 but negative for CD3. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -encoded RNA was detected by in situ hybridization, and Ki-67 staining demonstrated a higher percentage of positive cells. Consequently, an EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, developed as PTLD, was diagnosed. Complete remission was achieved with a reduced immunomodulatory drug dosage and rituximab therapy. She has been alive for 8 months postoperatively without recurrence. This case suggests that PTLD should be considered in assessing patients presenting with abdominal symptoms following organ transplantation."

A 60-year-old female presented with painful lump in right iliac fossa (RIF) for 3 weeks and acute complete bowel obstruction for 3 days. Examination revealed hard, irregular and fixed lump in the RIF. Ultrasonography of abdomen and pelvis showed ileocecal mass while contract enhanced computed tomography (CECT) suggested carcinoma transverse colon with mesenteric metastasis. The patient underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy and right extended hemicolectomy for densely adherent mass incorporating distal ileum, cecum, ascending and proximal transverse colon with adjacent mesenteries. However, histopathological examination revealed colonic actinomycosis. The patient was commenced on intravenous penicillin G followed by oral amoxicillin. Colonic actinomycosis is a rare infection presenting with pain abdomen, change in bowel habit, and rarely, abdominal mass. Preoperative diagnosis is difficult due to lack of pathognomonic clinical, laboratory and radiological findings. Differentiation from other diseases such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, colon carcinoma, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis is challenging. Diagnosis is confirmed histologically by presence of Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Grocott- positive sulphur granules with filaments. Newer molecular diagnoses are under study. Medical therapy is main line of treatment, most effectively with parenteral and oral beta lactams. Actinomycosis may present with aggressive invasion and infiltration of adjacent organs, mesentery, and abdominal wall mimicking malignancy. Acute presentation with bowel obstruction would mandate surgical intervention."

Automatic and accurate segmentation of the appendix from medical imaging is a challenging task, due to its small size, variability in shape, and proximity to other anatomical structures. In this study, we propose a backbone-enriched Mask R-CNN architecture (MaskAppendix) on the Detectron platform, enhanced with Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), for precise appendix segmentation on computed tomography (CT) scans. In the proposed MaskAppendix deep learning model, ResNet101 network is used as the backbone. By integrating Grad-CAM into the MaskAppendix network, our model improves feature localization, allowing it to better capture subtle variations in appendix morphology. We conduct extensive experiments on a dataset of abdominal CT scans, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in appendix segmentation, outperforming traditional segmentation techniques in terms of both accuracy and robustness. In the automatic segmentation of the appendix region in CT slices, a DSC score of 87.17% was achieved with the proposed approach, and the results obtained have the potential to improve clinical diagnostic accuracy. This framework provides an effective tool for aiding clinicians in the diagnosis of appendicitis and other related conditions, reducing the potential for diagnostic errors and enhancing clinical workflow efficiency."

An 82-year-old man with atrial fibrillation, emphysema, chronic heart failure-associated cardiomegaly, and a history of aortic stenting for an abdominal aortic aneurysm underwent a left upper lobectomy without mediastinal nodal dissection for lung cancer. Twenty-eight hours postoperatively, he lost consciousness and went into shock vitals; computed tomography revealed cardiac tamponade. Emergency surgery was performed, which revealed a left circumflex artery laceration. Although the laceration was successfully repaired, he had a gastrointestinal perforation and developed septic shock. He died 35 days after the lung surgery. Intraoperative injury to the heart cannot be ruled out, but the site of the coronary artery injury was located far from the hilum outside the surgical field during the lobectomy. Three-dimensional computed tomography showed that the site of injury was close to the multiple firing junction of the staples that divided the anterior interlobar fissure. Two staples at the multiple firing junction, which protruded perpendicularly to the cut surface, could injure the coronary artery. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the intraoperative manipulation procedures contributed to the coronary artery injury, we speculate that the protruding staples might penetrate the pericardium after lung expansion and eventually injured the coronary artery."

    "abstract": "Calcified nodule (CN) is a phenotypic feature of calcified plaques which causes acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Recent studies reported that culprit lesions harboring CN has been shown to increase a risk of repeat revascularization after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the implantation of newer-generation drug-eluting stent (DES) or debulking device. Mechanistically, a re-protrusion of CN into the lumen has been considered as an important cause associated with repeat revascularization after PCI. These observations suggest the need for additional therapeutic approach to mitigate a risk of repeat revascularization at CN lesions. Here we report a case who received the implantation of one covered stent due to coronary artery perforation after stent implantation at coronary lesion exhibiting CN. This case is unique in terms of preventing restenosis by using covered stent which could physically hinder protrusion of CN through the stent strut. A 79-year-old man presented to the emergency department with his prolonged chest pain. Although he had a history of hypertension and adrenal hypertrophy, he was not taking any medication prior to his admission. He was diagnosed as ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Emergent coronary angiography revealed one severe stenosis in the middle segment of his right coronary artery (RCA). Primary PCI was performed under the guidance of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging. IVUS imaging prior to PCI revealed a protruding shape of calcification and its irregular surface at his culprit lesion, suggesting the presence of a CN. Following one DES implantation, coronary artery perforation occurred at the segment receiving DES implantation. We implanted one covered stent for the coronary artery perforation. This procedure resulted in successfully sealing coronary artery perforation. Seven months later, follow-up coronary angiography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging were conducted to evaluate his RCA. Any in-stent restenosis (ISR) was not observed. Furthermore, OCT imaging elucidated a small amount of neointimal proliferation without any re-protruding feature of CN through the segment receiving a covered stent. Of note, he did not experience any clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) for 2 years after PCI. Our case indicates the use of covered stent as an effective approach to physically hinder the re-protrusion of calcification tissues into the lumen, potentially mitigating a risk of ISR."

    "abstract": "Neonatal adrenal haemorrhage affects approximately 0.17%-0.21% of babies, although, usually, it remains asymptomatic, and therefore, the exact incidence is probably greater. The increased vascularity and relatively large size of the adrenal glands in neonates increases their vulnerability to haemorrhage during labour. There have been few cases that have presented with bowel obstruction.A term neonate was admitted with bilious vomiting, dehydration and mottled skin. He was afebrile but hypoglycaemic. Dark green aspirations were present on placement of a nasogastric tube, and emergent upper gastrointestinal contrast study demonstrated failure of contrast to pass and deviation of the duodenum. Together these features raised concern of malrotation with volvulus promoting surgical exploration. Intraoperatively, a left suprarenal mass was discovered, causing bowel obstruction. An ileostomy was created, and a biopsy was taken. Adrenal haemorrhage was diagnosed, which is an extremely rare cause of bowel obstruction. Serial ultrasound scans have been done since, showing reduction of the haemorrhage and his ileostomy has been reversed.Adrenal haemorrhage is rarely reported to cause bowel obstruction. A neonate with bilious vomiting and an abnormal contrast may represent malrotation; however, adrenal haemorrhage is an uncommon, but important, differential to consider in these scenarios."

    "abstract": "Acute right colic diverticulitis (ARD) is less frequent in Western countries than acute sigmoid diverticulitis (ASD). We aimed to compare the management of ARD and ASD operated on in emergency. All consecutive patients who had emergency surgery for ASD and ARD (2010-2021) were included in a retrospective, multicenter, cohort study. Patients were identified from databases in French centers that were members of the French Surgical Association. Emergency surgery was performed during the same hospitalization for peritonitis or after failure of conservative treatment. Early and late postoperative outcomes were studied. A total of 2297 patients were included with 2256 (98.2%) ASD and 41 (1.8%) ARD patients. Baseline characteristics were similar. Overall, patients were rated Hinchey 3-4 (63.9%, n = 1468, p = 0.287). ARD was more often treated with resection and anastomosis, protected or not (53.7%, n = 22), whereas ASD was mainly treated with resection and terminal ostomy (62.5% (n = 1409), p < 0.001). Median operative time was shorter for ARD (120 vs 146 min, p = 0.04). The group of ARD patients showed a higher prevalence of Clavien III/IV complications compared to the group of ASD patients, although no statistically significant difference was observed (41.5%, n = 17 vs. 27.6%, n = 620, p = 0.054). However 90-day mortality only happened in ASD patients (9.8%, n = 223 vs 0, p = 0.03). ARD patients had more diverticulitis recurrence (46.3%, n = 19 vs 13.4%, n = 303, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified female sex as a protective factor for recurrence [odds ratio (OR) 0.55, p < 0.001] and ARD as a risk factor (OR 8.85, p < 0.001). Operated on in emergency, ARDs have more resection anastomosis, with a similar rate of complications, less mortality, and more recurrence of diverticulitis than ASD."

    "abstract": "Corneal thinning and perforation are ocular emergencies necessitating urgent intervention to prevent visual impairment or enucleation. Cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive is frequently used to maintain globe integrity in these cases. However, gaps remain in understanding the outcomes of corneal gluing and the factors influencing its efficacy. This case series evaluates the clinical characteristics and outcomes of glue application in corneal thinning and perforation. A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients treated for corneal thinning and perforation at the University of Florida between January 2012 and May 2023. Demographic data, clinical history, glue application details, and posttreatment outcomes were collected and analyzed. The study included 128 eyes from 125 subjects. Corneal perforation was found in 71 eyes (55.5%), mostly centrally (49.2%). The leading cause of perforation/thinning was microbial infection (45.3%). The average number of glue applications per eye was 1.66. Within 1 month, 23 patients (18.0%) required only glue reapplication, 37 (28.9%) required surgical intervention (regardless of glue reapplication), and 68 (53.1%) required no further treatment. Factors significantly linked to gluing failure (requiring surgery within 1 month) in univariate analysis included large perforation size, microbial infection, ocular surface disorder, single glue application, and indirect application via sterile drape. Multivariate analysis showed that only large perforation size was significantly associated with gluing failure. Corneal glue application is an effective temporizing measure for corneal thinning and perforation, with multiple applications potentially providing added stability to the globe. However, the need for surgical intervention is high."

    "abstract": "This is a review curriculum utilizing multiple methods of education to enhance the skills of generalist healthcare providers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in the identification and stabilization of pediatric respiratory emergencies. Our audience of implementation was Belizean generalist providers (nurses and physicians). 8-10 hours. Early recognition and stabilization of critical pediatric patients can improve outcomes. Compared with resource-rich systems, many low-resource settings (i.e., LMICs) rely on generalists to provide most pediatric acute care. We created a curriculum for general practitioners comprising multiple educational modules focused on identifying and stabilizing pediatric emergencies. Our aim was to develop an educational framework to update and teach generalists on the recommendations and techniques of optimally evaluating and managing pediatric nutritional and gastrointestinal emergencies: bowel obstructions, gastroenteritis, and malnutrition. The aim of this curriculum is to increase learners' proficiency in identifying and stabilizing acutely ill pediatric patients with gastrointestinal medical or surgical disease or complications of malnutrition. This module focuses on the diagnosis and management of gastroenteritis, acute bowel obstruction, and deficiencies of feeding and nutrition. The target audience for this curriculum is generalist physicians and nurses in limited-resource settings. The educational strategies used in this curriculum include didactic lectures, medical simulation, and small-group sessions. We evaluated written pretests before and posttests after intervention and retested participants four months later to evaluate for knowledge retention. Participants provided qualitative feedback on the module. We taught 21 providers. Eleven providers completed the pretest/posttest and eight completed the retest. The mean test scores improved from 8.3 ± 1.7 in the pretest to 12.2 ± 2.6 in the posttest (mean difference: 1.4, P=0.027). The mean test score at pretest was 8.3 ± 2.3, which increased to 10.8 ± 3.0 at retest (mean difference: 2.5, P=0.060). Seven (71.4%) and four (28.5%) participants found the course \"extremely useful\" and \"very useful,\" respectively (n=11). This curriculum may be an effective and welcome training tool for Belizean generalist providers. There was a statistically significant improvement in the test performance but not in retesting, possibly due to our small sample size and high attrition rate. Evaluation of other modules in this curriculum, application of this curriculum in other locations, and measuring clinical practice interventions will be included in future investigations.

    "abstract": "Objectives: Acute care surgery (ACS) encompasses surgical critical care, emergency general surgery, and the surgical management of trauma. Following ACS implementation at our institution, we developed a perioperative clinical pathway for acute appendicitis (AA) to improve efficiency and standardize post-operative care. The purpose of our study is to assess patient outcomes utilizing our ACS clinical pathway for patients with AA. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study involving patients admitted to our tertiary care facility with AA who underwent appendectomy. Patients were classified by pre-implementation (January 1, 2016-July 31, 2018) and post-implementation (August 1, 2018-December 31, 2020) of our ACS clinical pathway. The primary outcome was hospital length of stay (LOS). Statistical analysis was performed using SAS with a p-value <0.05 determined as significant. Results: Of the 492 patients included, 225 were in the pre- and 267 were in the post-implementation cohorts. Hospital LOS was substantially decreased in the post-implementation cohort (31.2 vs. 50.4 h, p < 0.001). The post-implementation group had a substantial decrease in computed tomography (CT) to operating room (OR) start time (6.81 vs. 11.4 h, p < 0.001), CT to antibiotic agents' administration (2.20 vs. 3.37 h, p < 0.001), inpatient opioid utilization (125 morphine equivalents [ME] vs. 172 ME, p < 0.001), and discharge antibiotic agents' prescription rates (23.6% vs. 30.7%, p = 0.077). Recovery unit discharges (20 vs. 9%, p < 0.001) were increased in the post-implementation cohort. Conclusion: Our ACS clinical pathway for AA resulted in earlier surgical intervention, enhanced opioid and antimicrobial stewardship, and gains in surgical care efficiencies."

    "abstract": "The complications associated with cardiac device implants ranges between 5.3% and 14.3%. Cardiac perforation due to \"leads\" represent a very rare complication of cardiac device implantation, ranging between 0.3% and 0.7%. Clinically, they can manifest different, nonspecific symptoms; hence, the diagnosis may not be immediate. Our clinical case describes the successful treatment of cardiac tamponade occurring in a Caucasian 79-year-old man following a pacemaker implantation. Two days after the procedure, the patient reported an episode of nonspecific chest pain associated with syncope. The echocardiogram performed revealed a pericardial effusion in the apical area, along the right chambers, with a thickness of 7 mm, not hemodynamically significant. A chest computed tomography scan with contrast showed hemopericardium (maximum thickness of 11 mm), caused by an atrial perforation. A few hours later, the patient experienced hemodynamic instability. For this reason, an urgent sternotomy was performed with drainage of a significant hemopericardial effusion, revealing a perforation of the upper free wall of the right atrium with pericardial injury caused by the retractable screw lead. The perforation site was sutured and the sternal wound was closed. The patient was discharged after 4 days without further complications. At the control visit, scheduled 30 days after the hospital discharge, the patient was in good conditions. Although the atrial perforations from leads are very rare complications of pacemaker implantation procedures, they are potentially lethal. In conclusion, this clinical case highlights the need, before hospital discharge, of an accurate screening for evaluation the pericardial effusion in patients that undergo to the cardiac implantable electronic devices."

    "abstract": "Inequities in health care access lead to inequities in outcome. In recent years, health outcome disparities have been documented in children with acute appendicitis and sociodemographic predictors of imaging utilization have not been adequately assessed. The purpose of our study is to assess sociodemographic predictors for the diagnostic imaging of children with right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain. Our hypothesis is that disparities exist in imaging utilization. Our nationwide retrospective cohort study of the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database queried emergency department encounters for children aged 0-18 years presenting with RLQ pain (ICD code CM R10.31) between January 2018 and September 2023. Primary exposures included neighborhood-level sociodemographic metrics as measured by Child Opportunity Index, race/ethnicity, and insurance status. Outcomes included no diagnostic imaging, diagnostic imaging with radiography alone, ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Multivariable logistic regression analyses assessed modality usage with respect to the primary exposures after controlling for demographic (age, gender) and additional (hospital geographic region, time of imaging) covariates. To avoid the perpetuation of bias, reference categories were determined by the lowest numerical value for each covariate. In total, 100,161 patient encounters met inclusion criteria (mean patient age 11.2 years ± 3.9; 59.3%, n = 59,416 females). Imaging utilized was US (78.0%; n = 78,115), CT (16.4%, n = 16,405), no imaging (13.9%, n = 13,894), radiography alone (4.4%, n = 4,429), and MRI (3.1%, n = 3,148). The most predictive factors for no imaging were moderate, low, and very low Child Opportunity Index (aOR 1.25, 1.17, and 1.18 [95% CI 1.10-1.33] compared to very high Child Opportunity Index); Black race/ethnicity (aOR 1.26 [95% CI 1.11-1.44] compared to White or Asian race/ethnicity); and public or other insurance (aOR 1.23 and 1.32 [95% CI 1.18-1.41] compared to commercial insurance). The most predictive factors for radiography alone were Black race/ethnicity (aOR 1.30 [95% CI 1.17-1.45] compared to Hispanic race/ethnicity) and public or other insurance (aOR 1.26 [95% CI 1.11-1.44] compared to commercial). The most predictive factors for US were very-high Child Opportunity Index (aOR 1.16 [95% CI 1.09-1.22] compared to very low Child Opportunity Index); Asian, NH-White, or Hispanic race/ethnicity (aOR 1.33, 1.31, 1.30 [95% CI 1.18-1.40] compared to Black race/ethnicity); and commercial insurance (aOR 1.20 [95% CI 1.16-1.25] compared to public insurance). The most predictive factor for CT was White race/ethnicity (aOR 1.26 [95% CI 1.11-1.43] compared with Asian race/ethnicity) and the most predictive factor for MRI was Hispanic race/ethnicity (aOR 1.49 [95% CI 1.17-1.61] compared with Black race/ethnicity). The greatest predictor of cross-sectional imaging was a hospital's region, with CT most likely in southern hospitals (aOR 4.09 [95% CI 2.17-7.70] compared with northeast hospitals). Patient Child Opportunity Index did not predict the likelihood of cross-sectional imaging with CT or MRI in tertiary pediatric centers. Sociodemographic disparities exist in the imaging of children presenting to tertiary pediatric hospitals with RLQ pain. Future studies are needed to analyze the causes of such disparities both on hospital and departmental levels."

    "abstract": "Stump appendicitis, an inflammation of the residual appendix after appendicectomy, presents with all the clinical features of acute appendicitis. This variant poses diagnostic challenges, particularly in patients with right iliac fossa pain. We present a case of a 58-year-old man who developed an appendiceal stump abscess eight months after laparoscopic appendectomy. In addition to stable vital signs, abdominal examination revealed pain in the right lower quadrant. The CT scan showed a collection with a tubular structure corresponding to a remaining appendiceal stump. He underwent emergency laparoscopic surgery. Intraoperatively, a perforated stump and cecal involvement were noted, necessitating stump resection and abscess drainage. Literature review underscores stump appendicitis as rare but serious. Surgeons face challenges in accurately identifying the appendix base, crucial for preventing stump appendicitis. Imaging, especially computed tomography, aids diagnosis. Stump appendicitis complications, including necrosis and perforation, emphasize the need for prompt intervention. Differential diagnoses include cecal diverticulitis and duplicated appendix. Imaging techniques, particularly CT, play pivotal roles in diagnosis. Preventive measures include stump length control and heightened suspicion in patients with prior appendectomy. Surgical excision remains the preferred treatment, though optimal approach remains unclear. Stump appendicitis may manifest months to years post-appendectomy, necessitating vigilant follow-up. Awareness of this complication and prompt management are crucial for favorable outcomes."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency that causes acute abdominal pain and affects approximately 7-8% of the population during their lifetime. The closure of the appendix stump during laparoscopic appendectomy is one of the most critical steps of the surgery to prevent life-threatening complications such as postoperative fistula, peritonitis, and sepsis. The mate-rial chosen for appendix stump closure must be effective, safe, and economical. However, there is still no consensus on the optimal method for stump closure. In this study, we aimed to compare the advantages and reliability of three different methods used for appendix stump closure. At Istanbul University-Cerrahpaşa, Cerrahpaşa Medical Faculty, Department of General Surgery, cases that underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis between January 2022 and April 2024 were retrospectively analyzed using the hospital's data system. The patients' demographic data, laboratory values, pathology reports, surgical notes, duration of hospital stay, duration of surgery, total hospital costs, complications related to the surgery within 30 days postoperatively, and the management of these complications were examined. The study included a total of 150 individuals, with 83 (55.33%) males and 67 (44.67%) females. The average age of the participants was 38.45±14.48 years. In terms of the materials used for stump closure, endoloop was used in 82 (54.67%) cases, Hem-o-lok clip in 30 (20.00%) cases, and endostapler in 38 (25.33%) cases. In 144 (96%) cases, no Clavien-Dindo (CD) complications were observed, while complications occurred in six (4%) cases. These six complications included two intra-abdominal abscesses (CD Grade 3), two wound infections (CD Grade 1), one case of bleeding (CD Grade 2), and one pulmonary embolism (CD Grade 4). The use of endoloop, polymeric clips, and endostapler in laparoscopic appendectomy is safe and effective for appendectomy. All three methods can be successfully applied without an increase in intraoperative or postoperative complications. However, due to the higher treatment costs associated with endostapler, its use should be reserved for situations where securing the appendix stump cannot be achieved with endoloop or Hem-o-lok clip."

He was admitted to the emergency room due to severe upper abdominal pain. Laboratory tests indicated elevated levels of white blood cells, rapid C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin, while the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test returned negative. An abdominal CT examination revealed gas and fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity, raising suspicion for gastrointestinal perforation and peritonitis. Initially, he received symptomatic treatment for gastrointestinal perforation and abdominal infection, but his response to the treatment was poor.Through metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and multiple blood cultures, a mixed infection of T. marneffei and E. faecium was identified in the patient's blood. Combination treatment with vancomycin and amphotericin B was initiated to manage the symptoms. However, we discovered genome-wide exon CARD9 mutations in the patient, complicating the treatment process. Ultimately, the delayed diagnosis of T. marneffei resulted in the patient's severe deterioration, rendering the anti-infective treatment ineffective, and leading to the patient's death.This report underscores the challenges associated with diagnosing T. marneffei infections in non-AIDS patients and in non-endemic regions. The diagnosis of disseminated infections poses significant difficulties, particularly when mixed infections are present, complicating clinical treatment. This highlights the critical importance of standardized blood cultures for the early diagnosis of T. marneffei. Additionally, we must prioritize timely whole-genome testing to identify potential immune gene mutations."

Symptoms were initially attributed to subacute thyroiditis, and she was discharged with steroids and propranolol. She presented again 1 week later with complaints of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and shortness of breath. She was readmitted and developed sepsis with multiorgan system infection and Lemierre syndrome. Further imaging revealed acute suppurative thyroiditis as the likely source. Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy revealed ulceration of the anterior esophageal wall, a fistulous tract to the thyroid, and copious purulent drainage. Esophageal biopsies with immunostaining established a diagnosis of herpes simplex virus esophagitis as the likely cause of esophageal perforation, fistula development, and acute suppurative thyroiditis."

However, it has also been linked to illicit drug use, with cocaine being one of the most common. We present the case of a previously healthy 23-year-old patient who arrived at the emergency department with retrosternal pain, odynophagia, dyspnea, and crepitus in the neck and chest after inhaling cocaine for three consecutive days. The patient was hemodynamically stable, with extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the neck and chest. Computed tomography of the neck and chest revealed abundant air dissecting the superficial and deep planes of the neck and mediastinum, particularly in its upper and middle portions. Additional studies included nasolaryngoscopy, which showed white material suggestive of inhaled substance use. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed to rule out perforation, which did not identify any lesions. Blood tests showed no abnormalities. Conservative management with analgesia and monitoring was initiated, resulting in the improvement of subcutaneous emphysema and pain. The patient was discharged after a two-day hospital stay. There were no complications or further visits to the institution within the following six months. This case highlights the importance of investigating a history of illicit drug use, particularly cocaine, in cases of spontaneous pneumomediastinum. Our findings support the generally benign course of this condition and the effectiveness of conservative management in the absence of complications."

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has primarily been characterized by respiratory symptoms, but emerging evidence suggests multi-organ involvement, including the gastrointestinal tract. This case report aims to highlight colon perforation as a rare but significant complication in COVID-19 patients. We present two cases of male patients, aged 38 and 33, who were admitted with severe COVID-19 symptoms and required intubation and ventilator support. Both patients developed abdominal distension during their ICU stay, prompting surgical consultations. In the first case, a 38-year-old male developed septic shock and abdominal distension on day 29 of his hospital stay. An exploratory laparotomy revealed a 2 mm perforation in the sigmoid colon, which was managed with Hartmann's procedure. In the second case, a 33-year-old male developed abdominal distension one week post-admission. An exploratory laparotomy revealed a 2 mm perforation in the mid-transverse colon, managed initially with a primary two-layer repair and later with a transverse loop colostomy due to additional perforations. These cases emphasize the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for gastrointestinal complications, such as colon perforation, in COVID-19 patients. Early diagnosis and surgical intervention are crucial for managing this life-threatening complication. Further research is needed to understand the incidence and underlying mechanisms of colon perforation in COVID-19 patients."

Owing to its rarity and nonspecific clinical manifestation, omental T-cell lymphoma is often diagnosed at a later stage, riddled with complications. While imaging modalities such as computed tomography scan can help a physician reach a diagnosis, cases that present with complications may require a multidisciplinary approach that combines surgical exploration along with consultation from Oncology. We hereby report a rare case of a 66-year-old African American male patient who presented to the emergency department with complaints of acute gastrointestinal obstruction. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed evidence of an internal hernia and surgical exploration revealed a hemorrhagic and infarcted omentum. Biopsies along with immunophenotypic studies confirmed the diagnosis of anaplastic T-cell lymphoma of the omentum complicated by Massilia timonae infection. The case highlights the significance of considering lymphoma, although rare, as a differential in a patient who presents with small bowel obstruction and the importance of investigating for malignancy for early diagnosis and treatment of primary omental lymphomas, before complications develop."

Optimal timing is unclear and would be best resolved through a randomised controlled trial; such a trial is likely to be challenging. To determine if it is feasible to conduct a clinical trial comparing 'early' versus 'late' stoma closure in neonates. Mixed methods comprising three parallel workstreams incorporating: a clinician survey, prospective observational cohort study, parent interviews, focus groups, database analyses and consensus meeting. Specialist neonatal surgical centres across the United Kingdom. Neonatologists, neonatal surgeons, neonatal dietitians and neonatal nurses who care for neonates with stomas. Neonates with recent stoma, their parents and the clinicians looking after them. Three existing, overlapping clinical databases. One hundred and sixty-six professionals from all 27 neonatal surgical centres completed the survey: 6 weeks was the most common target time for stoma closure across clinical scenarios, although there was wide variation. Timing of closure was influenced by nutrition, growth and stoma complications. The prospective cohort study enrolled 56 infants from 8 centres. Infants were mostly preterm with necrotising enterocolitis or intestinal perforation. Clinicians identified extreme preterm gestation and clinical conditions as reasons for not randomising babies into a hypothetical trial comparing early and late stoma closure. Parents and healthcare professionals identified that comparator arms needed more clinical flexibility in relation to timing of stoma closure. Analysis of existing databases revealed wide variation in current timing of stoma closure in neonates and identified approximately 300 eligible infants for a trial per annum in the United Kingdom. A trial of 'early' compared to 'late' stoma closure in neonates is feasible and is important to families and health professionals. The population of eligible babies in the United Kingdom is sufficient for such a trial. Challenges centre around lack of equipoise in certain scenarios, specifically: extremely preterm infants; infants waiting too long for stoma closure in the 'late' comparator; and logistical issues in closing a stoma at a trial-allocated time. These challenges are addressable by incorporating flexibility based on gestation at birth, communicating that both trial arms are standard practice and valid treatment options, and providing resources, for example, for operating lists. We recommend the following population, intervention, comparator and outcome as a starting point to inform future trial design. Population: neonates with stomas (excluding those with a fixed treatment pathway). Intervention: stoma closure at 6 weeks and after 32 weeks post conceptual age. Comparator: expectant management with stoma closure undertaken when the clinical team determines is best for the infant. Primary outcomes: weight gain/growth or length of hospital stay. This study is registered as IRAS Project ID 278331, REC Reference 20/LO/1227. This award was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme (NIHR award ref: NIHR128617) and is published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 28, No. 71. See the NIHR Funding and Awards website for further award information. Found out what currently happens to babies with a stoma through a survey of healthcare staff and looking at data from several national databases. Collected data on 56 babies with stomas in 8 hospitals, including asking their doctors whether they would recruit these babies to a trial and when they would close their stoma. Interviewed parents of children who had had a stoma. Held focus groups with staff at the eight hospitals. Held a meeting for National Health Service staff and parents to discuss the way forwards. Parents and doctors think this question is important and that a clinical trial is a good idea. Deciding on the timing of stoma closure in the trial and what we mean by ‘early’ and ‘late’ is critical to the success of a trial. The timing may need to take into account that some babies born extremely preterm may be difficult to include. A trial that compares how well infants grow and/or length of stay in hospital between babies having early or later stoma closure may well be feasible. The National Institute for Health and Care Research (research arm of the Department of Health and Social Care) will use this to information to help decide if they would like to fund a trial in the future."

    "title": "Can Ultrasound Spot the Culprit - Evaluating the Effectiveness of Ultrasonography in Precisely Diagnosing Acute Appendicitis in Children.",
    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency in children, often requiring imaging for confirmation due to diverse presentations. While computed tomography scan is favored in many centers for its sensitivity, it comes with radiation exposure and higher costs. Ultrasonography, being radiation-free and cost-effective, is gaining popularity, especially in pediatric cases. However, its reported accuracy varies in the literature. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography in pediatric appendicitis cases and to determine its precision in distinguishing between simple and complicated cases of appendicitis. A retrospective analysis was conducted on children with suspected appendicitis who presented to the department of pediatric surgery. All patients underwent ultrasonography followed by appendicectomy based on considered clinical decision. Ultrasonography findings were compared with intraoperative observations categorized as uncomplicated or complicated appendicitis. Among 152 patients, ultrasonography accurately diagnosed appendicitis in 94.6% of cases, with 5.38% having nonvisualized appendices. In our group, the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound to detect appendicitis were 94.62% and 95.65%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of the test is 95.63%. However, in our study, the sensitivity of the ultrasonography to correctly identify if it is a simple or complicated appendicitis was only 54.9% but had a specificity of 98.7%. Thus, ultrasonography showed a much lower sensitivity (54.9%) in distinguishing between simple and complicated appendicitis. Ultrasonography demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing pediatric appendicitis, making it a promising preoperative investigation. However, it may not accurately differentiate between simple and complicated cases. A comprehensive approach involving clinical and laboratory parameters alongside secondary imaging may be necessary for accurate diagnosis, especially in cases of perforated appendicitis."

    "abstract": "The urachus, an embryonic organ associated with the bladder, typically undergoes degeneration shortly after birth. Inadequate closure of the urachus can result in urachal malformations, with the most common being a urachal cyst. Failure to promptly identify and address this condition can lead to complications such as sepsis, fistula development, and cyst rupture, mimicking symptoms of peritonitis. Therefore, maintaining a heightened level of suspicion is crucial for timely diagnosis and effective management of urachal cysts, particularly in emergency room settings. We present the case of a 24-year-old male who exhibited clinical signs consistent with an acute abdomen. The use of imaging techniques confirmed the presence of an infected urachal cyst, which was successfully treated through surgical intervention."

    "abstract": "To emulate target trials comparing recurrence of nephrolithiasis among patients with pre-existing nephrolithiasis (overall and stratified by concomitant gout) initiating sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors versus an active comparator. Target trial emulation studies. Canadian population database, January 2014 to June 2022. 20 146 patients with nephrolithiasis and type 2 diabetes, including those with concomitant gout at baseline, a high risk group. Initiation of an SGLT-2 inhibitor or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, with a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor as alternative comparator. The primary outcome was recurrent nephrolithiasis events ascertained from diagnoses during emergency department visits, hospital admissions, or outpatient visits. Secondary outcomes included nephrolithiasis resulting in hospital admission or emergency department visits and flare-up of gout, as well as a positive control outcome (genital infection) and negative control outcomes (osteoarthritis encounter and appendicitis). Poisson and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used (primary analyses), as well as overlap weighting. After inverse probability of treatment weighting, 1924 recurrent nephrolithiasis events occurred among the 14 456 weighted patients who used an SGLT-2 inhibitor (105.3 per 1000 person years), compared with 853 events among the 5877 weighted patients who used a GLP-1 receptor agonist (156.4 per 1000 person years). The adjusted rate ratio was 0.67 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.79) and rate difference was -51 (95% CI -63 to -40) per 1000 person years, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 20. Among those with recently active nephrolithiasis, the absolute rate difference was 219 per 1000 person years (NNT of 5). Protective associations persisted for nephrolithiasis events that required emergency department visits, hospital admissions, or procedures, and when an SGLT-2 inhibitor was compared with a DPP-4 inhibitor (rate ratio 0.73 (0.68 to 0.78), rate difference -38 (-46 to -29) per 1000 person years (NNT of 26)). Protective associations also persisted among patients with nephrolithiasis and concomitant gout, with a rate ratio of 0.67 (0.57 to 0.79) and rate difference of -53 (95% CI -78 to -27) per 1000 person years versus a GLP-1 receptor agonist (NNT of 19), and 0.63 (0.55 to 0.72) and-62 (-81 to -42) per 1000 person years, respectively, versus a DPP-4 inhibitor (NNT of 16). Furthermore, SGLT-2 inhibitor use was associated with a lower rate of gout flare-ups (rate ratio 0.72, 0.54 to 0.95, rate difference -16, -31 to -1 per 1000 person years) compared with GLP-1 receptor agonists (0.65, 0.52 to 0.82, and -21, -33 to -9 per 1000 person years) compared with DPP-4 inhibitors. SGLT-2 inhibitor initiators showed higher risk of genital infection (eg, hazard ratio 2.21, 95% CI 1.68 to 2.90, and rate difference 13 per 1000 person years), but no altered risk of osteoarthritis encounter (0.87, 0.68 to 1.1, and -2 per 1000 person years) or appendicitis (1.07, 0.69 to 1.67, and 1 per 1000 person years). Results were similar when propensity score overlap weighting was applied. The benefits associated with SGLT-2 inhibitor for patients with nephrolithiasis in these target trial emulations suggest they may be a useful addition to current treatments to simultaneously manage nephrolithiasis recurrence and comorbidities, including gout."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate preoperative factors, including the C-reactive protein (CRP)/albumin ratio (CAR), associated with postoperative outcomes in patients with colorectal perforation who underwent emergency surgery to improve postoperative prognosis. Twenty-eight consecutive patients who underwent emergency surgery for colorectal perforations were included. We retrospectively investigated the clinical factors associated with their postoperative outcomes. The median patient age was 69.5 years (range, 46.0-93.0 years); 13 patients (46.4%) were males and 15 (53.6%) were females. Colorectal cancer (8 [28.6%]) was the most common cause of colorectal perforation. Postoperative complications were diagnosed in 18 patients (64.3%), with intraabdominal abscess as the most common (6 [21.4%]). Multivariate analysis revealed that CAR (odds ratio, 1.357; 95% confidence interval, 1.056-1.743; p=0.017) was an independent risk factor for postoperative complications. A cutoff value of 4.9 was selected to predict the development of postoperative complications based on the CAR. The proportion of all postoperative complications (p=0.016), postoperative complications of Clavien-Dindo classification grade II or higher (p=0.002), and death during hospitalization (p=0.049) were significantly higher in the group of patients with CAR ≥ 4.9 than in those with CAR < 4.9. Additionally, intraabdominal abscess (p=0.049) was significantly higher in the group of patients with a non-improvement in CAR on postoperative day 3 than in those with an improvement in CAR on postoperative day 3. Perioperative CAR could be a predictor of perioperative complications and death and might be useful in improving the postoperative prognosis of colorectal perforations."

    "abstract": "The prognosis of patients with colorectal diverticular perforations requiring surgery is poor, and the efficacy of polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column direct hemoperfusion (PMX-DHP) in these patients has not yet been established. In the present study, we evaluated the prognostic factors and the efficacy of PMX-DHP in surgically treated patients with perforated colorectal diverticula. Of the 116 patients with colorectal perforations who underwent emergency surgery at our hospital between April 2018 and May 2023, we retrospectively reviewed 46 patients with perforated colorectal diverticula. Preoperative, surgical, and postoperative factors were compared between the survival and mortality groups. Subgroup analysis was performed to evaluate the efficacy of PMX-DHP in severe cases. The postoperative mortality group included 7 patients (15.2%), and PMX-DHP was performed in 14 (30.4%). PMX-DHP was performed significantly more often in the mortality group (P<0.01). In multivariate analysis, antithrombotic drug administration (hazard ratio, 16.600; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-209; P<0.05) and higher lactate levels (≥ 3.0 mmol/L) (hazard ratio, 42.300; 95% confidence interval, 2.69-667, P<0.01) were independent risk factors for postoperative mortality. PMX-DHP was performed in severe cases (patients with higher lactate levels, APACHE II scores, ventilator management frequencies, and noradrenalin use). PMX-DHP was not effective in improving prognosis in severe cases. Administration of antithrombotic drugs and higher lactate levels (≥ 3.0 mmol/L) are independent prognostic factors in colorectal diverticular perforations. PMX-DHP may not be effective in patients with severe preoperative conditions."

    "title": "Ruptured Appendiceal Diverticulum Leading to Tubo-Ovarian Abscess in a Non-Sexually Active Woman: A Case Study.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Pelvic inflammatory diseases and tubo-ovarian abscesses (TOAs) are rarely seen in non-sexually active (NSA) women. While the pathogenesis of TOA remains unclear, its risk factors include ascending infection of the genital tract, gastrointestinal tract translocation, congenital genitourinary anomalies, as well as virulence of the causative agents, with preceding bacteremia and septicemia. CASE REPORT Herein, we present the case of a 25-year-old female patient who was initially diagnosed with ovarian torsion and underwent diagnostic laparoscopy. Her intraoperative findings included bilateral TOAs and adhesions. Owing to this uncommon presentation, further investigation was conducted, including postoperative computed tomography. The results showed a likelihood of a perforated appendix, with a repeat laparoscopy confirming this diagnosis. Appendectomy and drainage were done. The microbial culture from the ovarian abscess revealed Streptococcus constellatus, a commensal organism found in the oral, gastrointestinal, and urogenital flora. This microorganism is rarely isolated as a pathogenic organism in immune-competent populations. Furthermore, the histopathology report of the appendix showed a rare occurrence of chronic active diverticulitis, with perforation and peri-appendicitis. CONCLUSIONS TOA in NSA women should be considered when evaluating differential diagnoses, with the possibility of infection with an atypical organism. Broad-spectrum antibiotics or multidrug therapy should be administered. When suspicion is raised, an imaging study with a broader view to detect the pathology of other organ systems is recommended. Lower abdominal pain in young female patients still poses a diagnostic dilemma and should be investigated; however, when the clinical presentation suggests a gynecological emergency, the time frame can pose challenges."

    "abstract": "We herein report a case of food-induced small bowel obstruction (FIBO) while using a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP1-RA), trying to lose weight due to distorted body image. The patient was a 30-year-old woman who was not obese (height 158 cm, weight 50 kg). She started taking an oral semaglutide, a GLP1-RA, and it was soon switched to weekly subcutaneous semaglutide because of ineffectiveness. More than 6 months after titrating up to 1.0 mg, she got drunk and chomped on a lot of scallops sandwiched between sheets of kelp, so-called \"kobujime\" in Japan, and half a day later complained of abdominal pain. Based on a finding of computed tomography at our emergency department, she was suspected of having a bowel obstruction and underwent laparoscopic surgery, which resulted in a diagnosis of small bowel obstruction by kelp. FIBO is rare, but it can become very severe once it happens. Although we cannot prove the direct pathophysiological effects of GLP1-RAs on FIBO in this particular case, GLP1-RAs have been reported to be one of the underlying risks of bowel obstruction based on epidemiological and basic research evidence; still, it is under-recognized. For example, the package inserts in Japan do not mention intestinal obstruction. We hope that the present report will prove helpful in paying attention to GLP1-RAs as a factor in bowel obstruction, including FIBO."

This project aims to identify whether the introduction of RPRA with the 'National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA) Calculator' as standard-of-care for EMAS at a regional Victorian hospital has improved postoperative outcomes, reduced unplanned postoperative critical care unit (CCU) admission rates, and impacted the 'no-lap' rate. An audit was performed including all adult general surgery patients who required EMAS at Bendigo Health between September 2017 and August 2022, including those palliated up-front. Patients requiring surgery for uncomplicated appendicitis, cholecystitis, trauma, and diagnostic laparoscopy were excluded. Patient demographics, preoperative NELA score, CCU admission data and postoperative outcomes were collected and compared between patients undergoing surgery before and after the introduction of RPRA. Six hundred and ninety-one patients were included in the analysis. Median NELA score was 5 (IQR 1.5-11.75). 2.60% of patients were palliated up-front and did not proceed to surgery. Among the 673 operative patients, 30-day mortality was 5.20%. Following the introduction of RPRA there was a significant reduction in the unplanned CCU admission rate, from 9.14% to 3.48% (P = 0.04). There was no change in postoperative mortality, severe complication rate or planned CCU admission rate. RPRA reduced rate of unplanned CCU admissions. Postoperative mortality and complication rates did not change following introduction of RPRA. RPRA appears useful in guidance of preoperative palliative decision-making, but further study is required to validate its use in this context."

    "title": "Case of colon perforation due to segmental absence of intestinal musculature accompanied by cancer treated with colonic resection and anastomosis.",
    "abstract": "Segmental absence of intestinal musculature (SAIM) is a partial defect of intestinal muscularis propria without diverticulum. Many reports indicate that the increase in intestinal pressure caused by enemas or endoscopic examinations leads to bowel perforation, but there are few reports involving malignant tumors. Moreover, few reports have had good outcomes after performing one-stage intestinal anastomosis. A 60-year-old male came to the office with right-side abdominal pain, and was diagnosed with acute generalized peritonitis caused by ascending colon perforation. Emergency laparotomy was performed, and oval and smooth perforation at the ascending colon was observed, which caused ascites with feces. In addition, there was a tumor on the distal side. The terminal ileum was not dilated, so the cause of the perforation was more likely the SAIM-related thin intestinal wall rather than increased internal intestinal pressure due to obstruction of the tumor. Therefore, a right hemicolectomy with functional end-to-end anastomosis (FEEA) between the ascending colon and ileum was performed, rather than creating a stoma. On pathological examination, the resected bowel segments had a partial defect of intestinal muscularis propria around the perforation, leading to the diagnosis of SAIM. The patient had a favorable postoperative course without anastomotic issues and was discharged safely. This case implies that initial intestinal anastomosis can be performed without creating a stoma when SAIM is suspected from the shape of the perforation and proximal intestine. This case report suggests surgeons should keep SAIM in mind during operations for colon perforations."

    "abstract": "Small mesenteric hiatal hernias (SMHHs) are defined as a small group of internal hernias (IHs) that frequently diagnosed in children. However, SMHHs are relatively rare in adults. Bowel loop herniation via an abnormal mesenteric defect can lead to strangulated intestinal obstruction. Congenital SMHHs are commonly observed in pediatric patients, with some cases involving neonatal death. A 24-year-old healthy male patient visited our hospital with a 2-day history of a sudden onset lower abdominal pain. He was initially diagnosed with enteritis. However, his symptoms worsened, and he was brought to our hospital. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed formation of a closed loop in the small intestine within the pelvis and signs of ischemia. As the patient was diagnosed with small bowel obstruction (SBO) caused by IH, emergency laparoscopic surgery was performed to loosen the obstruction. The patient was found to have ascites and small-bowel necrosis. A part of the small intestine that measured 30 cm was strangulated via a large-diameter defect (17 × 11 cm) in the ileal mesentery. Via a small abdominal incision, the necrotic bowel was resected, and the mesenteric defect was repaired. SMHHs are rare in adults, and they should be considered as potential causes of strangulated intestinal obstruction in adults without a history of laparotomy or trauma."

    "abstract": "Suspected appendicitis is the most common indication for non-obstetric surgery during pregnancy. Diagnosis and management of these patients can be challenging. Atypical clinical presentation has been described before, but the current literature consists mostly of small case series. Therefore, we conducted a large retrospective study to analyze the frequency and diagnostic accuracy of clinical signs, laboratory findings and imaging modalities in pregnant woman undergoing surgery for suspected appendicitis compared to a control group of non-pregnant women of childbearing age. We further describe intra- and postoperative findings in both groups. Data from consecutive patients who underwent appendectomy for suspected appendicitis during pregnancy were retrieved from the electronic patient database and analyzed. Preoperative clinical, laboratory and imaging findings as well as intra- and postoperative characteristics were compared between pregnant and non-pregnant women. Between January 2008 and June 2023, 99 pregnant woman and 1796 non-pregnant woman between the ages of 16 and 49 underwent emergency surgery for suspected appendicitis. Pregnant women were less likely to have right lower quadrant tenderness (p = 0.002), guarding (p = 0.011) and rebound tenderness (p = 0.097). A greater percentage of pregnant women had a symptom duration of more than 24 h before presentation (p = 0.003) Abdominal ultrasound showed a reduced diagnostic accuracy in pregnant women (p = 0.004). MRI was used in eight pregnant women and showed a diagnostic accuracy of 100%. Pregnant women had a longer operating time (p = 0.006), a higher rate of open appendectomies or conversion (p < 0.001) and a longer postoperative hospital stay (3.2 days vs. 2.2 days, p < 0.001). The perforation rate was also higher in pregnant women at 16% vs. 10% (p = 0.048). The diagnosis of acute appendicitis during pregnancy presents a challenge for the clinician. Our data confirm the paradigm of \"atypical presentation\" which should lead to an extended diagnostic workup. Ultrasound showed less diagnostic accuracy in pregnant women in our study. MRI is a useful tool to reduce uncertainty and the rate of negative appendectomies."

    "abstract": "Caustic substance ingestion is an emergency and life-threatening condition as it leads to tissue damage, acidosis, and multiorgan failure. This study presents a case report of hydrochloric acid ingestion and notably dark-red urine output due to acute tubular necrosis. A 59-year-old male presented with attempted suicide by ingesting 500 mL of hydrochloric acid (37%), and complained of severe abdominal pain and shortness of breath. Upon arrival, his vital signs showed a temperature of 34.3°C, blood pressure of 104/77 mm Hg, a pulse rate of 135 beats per minute, and the Glasgow Coma Scale E4V2M6. Following Foley catheter insertion, dark, bloody urine resulting from acute tubular necrosis was observed. His creatinine level was 1.1 mg/dL, and urinalysis showed 38 red blood cells per high-power field. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed metabolic acidosis. The patient's condition rapidly deteriorated in the emergency room, revealing diffuse circumferential ulceration with necrosis in the esophagus (Zargar score grade 3b). An exploratory laparotomy was performed for acidosis with intractable shock, revealing up to 1500 mL of bloody ascites, and ischemic changes with loss of peristalsis throughout the small bowel to the cecum. Esophagostomy with T-tube insertion was performed. Notably, stomach necrosis with perforation was identified, prompting a surgical consultation for primary perforation closure. During the operation, the patient experienced hemodynamic instability. The family confirmed the \"Do Not Resuscitate\" status, and he died in a critical state. For corrosive injuries, early endoscopy was crucial in assessing the extent of the damage and guiding treatment in this patient. It is essential to perform an early endoscopic examination in cases of acute nephrotoxic tubular necrosis following hydrochloric acid ingestion. Surgical intervention is warranted if necrosis is detected in the corrosive tissue."

While it may not show any symptoms, it has the potential to cause serious complications, such as intestinal obstruction. This case report presents a case of a 27-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with migrating right lower abdomen pain and vomiting. An initial diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made. An erect X-ray of the abdomen showed features of small bowel obstruction and with a clinical suspicion of Meckel's, a diagnostic laparoscopy had been planned. However, the diagnostic laparoscopy identified a gangrenous MD with axial torsion, with an ileal loop knotting at the base of Meckel's, causing small bowel obstruction. This entanglement led to an obstruction, which is a rare and challenging clinical scenario. Surgical resection of the affected bowel segment, including the MD, was performed, leading to a complete recovery of the patient. This case study emphasizes the diagnostic difficulties presented by MD, particularly when its symptoms resemble more prevalent illnesses like appendicitis. The rare incidence of axial torsion resulting in gangrene in MD with small bowel obstruction highlights the significance of including this illness in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen."

    "title": "\"Amr Sign\": A Case-Control Study Evaluating the Diagnostic Value of a New Clinical Sign in the Diagnosis of Acute Appendicitis.",
    "abstract": "Introduction Acute appendicitis, a prevalent cause of acute abdominal pain and a common indication for emergency surgery, presents a diagnostic challenge due to its diverse clinical presentation and variability in appendix location and symptoms. Traditional diagnostic approaches, including physical examination, clinical scoring systems, and imaging techniques, have limitations. This study introduces the \"Amr sign,\" a new diagnostic indicator characterized by sudden reflex hyperextension of the neck upon palpation of the right iliac fossa, which is hypothesized to reflect local peritoneal irritation from an inflamed appendix. Methods We conducted a prospective observational study at Alwakra Hospital from November 2016 to January 2019 that included 195 patients aged 15 years and older with right iliac fossa pain and an Alvarado score of four or more. The \"Amr sign\" was evaluated alongside standard clinical examination and imaging results. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed via histopathological confirmation, which is the gold standard. Results The \"Amr sign\" had a sensitivity of 68.6% and a specificity of 67.3%. The positive predictive value (PPV) was 89%, whereas the negative predictive value (NPV) was 45%. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.679 for the \"Amr sign\" compared with 0.622 for the other imaging modalities, suggesting comparable diagnostic performance. The \"Amr sign\" demonstrated a higher likelihood ratio of a positive test (2.3) and a lower likelihood ratio of a negative test (0.46). Conclusion The \"Amr sign\" is a promising diagnostic tool for acute appendicitis, offering a simple, reliable, and quick test that can be performed by less experienced physicians. While its sensitivity and specificity are moderate, its high PPV suggests that it is particularly useful in confirming appendicitis. Further research and validation are needed to fully establish its role in clinical practice."

    "abstract": "Background Appendicitis is a common surgical emergency with a global incidence rate of approximately 8%, necessitating prompt intervention to prevent complications. Appendectomy, either through open surgery or laparoscopy, is the standard treatment. Understanding the factors contributing to post-appendectomy complications is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Aim This retrospective study aimed to assess the surgical outcomes of various surgical approaches for appendicitis in Taif City, Saudi Arabia, specifically at King Abdulaziz Specialist Hospital. Methodology A total of 220 patients who underwent appendectomy in 2022 were included in the study. Data were obtained from medical files, and statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 26.0 (Released 2019; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were utilized, with a significance level set at p < 0.05. Results The majority of patients fell within the 20-39 age group (n = 124, 56.4%), and males constituted 63% (n = 140) of the cohort. Mean complications post-surgery were observed in 5.5% (n = 12) of cases, with surgical site infection being the most common complication (n = 9, 75%). Patients with complicated appendicitis had a significantly higher rate of surgical complications (n = 8, 44.4%) compared to those without complicated appendicitis (n = 4, 2%, p = 0.000). Longer hospital stays were associated with a higher incidence of complications (p = 0.008). The American Society of Anesthesiologists classification showed a significant association with complications (p = 0.000). Conclusions Our study underscores the importance of early diagnosis, appropriate surgical management, and infection prevention strategies in reducing post-appendectomy complications. Factors such as complicated appendicitis, longer hospital stays, and higher ASA classification were associated with increased complication rates."

    "title": "Inguinal Hernia With Gastric Content.",
    "abstract": "It is incredibly rare to find stomach content inside an inguinal hernia. Here, we report a 77-year-old male patient with a long-standing history of a left inguinal hernia spanning over a decade. Notably, the hernia had become irreducible for the past 20 days. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a substantial left inguinal hernia extending into the left scrotal region causing bowel obstruction. The hernial neck measured approximately 5.5 cm in transverse diameter. Protrusion through this defect included the stomach, small and large bowel loops, and free mesenteric fat and vessels into the hernial sac. The patient underwent a life-saving exploratory laparotomy and the hernial sac was reduced and repaired. In conclusion, inguinal hernias are common, but stomach content cases are extremely rare and they usually present with gastric outlet obstruction or gastric perforation. CT is recommended to visualize the stomach within the hernia and to exclude complications. Surgical repair is usually the management of choice."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) is a life-threatening complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). It is characterized by a fibrous membrane partially or totally encasing the small bowel and is a rare cause of small bowel obstruction (SBO). Here we present a case of a young woman with a history of PD presenting with SBO due to EPS. CASE REPORT A 37-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease secondary to uncontrolled hypertension previously on PD presented to the emergency department for evaluation of 1 week of intractable nausea and vomiting associated with diffuse abdominal pain. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed findings consistent with a fibrous membrane encapsulating the small bowel and a small bowel follow-through revealed an SBO. She was diagnosed with secondary stage 3 EPS due to PD. She was started on prednisone and tamoxifen with quick resolution of her symptoms. Unfortunately, due to numerous recurrent SBOs, she is now being evaluated for surgical treatment options. CONCLUSIONS This report has presented a case of EPS, a rare complication of PD, which requires early diagnosis and management to prevent potentially fatal consequences. Management should focus on treating the underlying condition, optimizing nutrition, and using corticosteroids or tamoxifen (alone or in combination) depending on disease state and contraindications, with the aim of reducing recurrent SBOs. Failure of conservative management may require surgical evaluation."

    "title": "Factors Associated with Postoperative Complications After Congenital Duodenal Obstruction Surgery: A Retrospective Study.",
    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Duodenal atresia and stenosis are common causes of intestinal obstruction. Associated anomalies significantly influence early postoperative mortality, while postoperative complications impact long-term survival. Materials and Methods: Over a 13-year period from January 2010 to August 2023, a total of 74 infants and children with congenital duodenal obstruction were treated at \"Grigore Alexandrescu\" Children's Emergency Hospital and met the inclusion criteria. All patients diagnosed with duodenal obstruction (both instrinsic and extrinsic causes) were included. Analysed data included congenital anomalies, Apgar scores, birth weights, surgical techniques, and complications. Results: The associated anomalies included cardiac (n = 33), Down syndrome (n = 13), neurological (n = 11), pulmonary (n = 7), renal (n = 4), skeletal (n = 1), and gastrointestinal and hepatobiliopancreatic anomalies (n = 25). In total, 12 patients experienced perioperative ventilation problems. Early postoperative complications (within 30 days) occurred in 21 patients, while 6 had late postoperative complications (after 30 days). Among non-surgical complications, we noted ventilation problems, sepsis (n = 7), and pneumothorax (n = 1). Surgical complications included adhesive bowel obstruction (n = 7), incisional hernia (n = 3), peritonitis (n = 3), dysfunctional duodenoduodenostomy or duodenojejunostomy (n = 3), pneumoperitoneum (n = 5), enteric fistula (n = 3), and volvulus (n = 4). Conclusions: Surprisingly, this retrospective study revealed that an Apgar score below 8, along with neurological and pulmonary abnormalities, is associated with postoperative complications. Conversely, other congenital anomalies, low birth weight, and age at admission do not serve as prognostic factors."

    "abstract": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most devastating gastrointestinal (GI) emergency in preterm neonates. Untargeted metabolomics may allow the identification of biomarkers involved in NEC pathophysiology. We conducted a prospective study including preterm infants born at < 34 gestational weeks (GWs) whose urine was longitudinally collected at birth (< 48 h, T0) and at 14 (T1) and 28 days (T2). Neonates were followed for their development of NEC, spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP), or other GI conditions and compared to those of matched healthy controls. Urine samples were investigated by untargeted metabolomic analysis based on mass-spectrometry. Thirty-five patients with NEC, 5 patients with SIP, 14 patients with other GI diseases and 113 controls were enrolled and selected for metabolomic analysis on the basis of their clinical characteristics and available samples. Considering urine samples at T0, the one-class classification approach was able to correctly classify 16/20 subjects (80%) who developed NEC, 3/3 (100%) who developed SIP and 5/7 subjects (71.4%) with other GI pathologies as not belonging to the control group. Neonates with surgical NEC had higher N-acetylaspartic acid, butyrylcarnitine and propionylcarnitine levels than did those with medical NEC. Considering the time evolution of the urinary metabolome, the NEC and control groups showed differences independently of the time point. The urinary metabolome is closely associated with the underlying GI disease from birth. Urinary metabolic features characterize NEC patients from healthy controls until 28 days of life. The early urinary metabolome has the potential to predict surgical NEC. Future studies are needed to validate our results."

    "abstract": "Invasive candidiasis (IC) represents a significant threat to both mortality and morbidity, especially among vulnerable populations. Intra-abdominal candidiasis (IAC) frequently occurs in critically ill and cancer patients, with these specific groups carrying a heightened risk for such invasive fungal infections. Despite this, there is a noticeable lack of attention to IAC in cancer patients within the literature, highlighting a critical gap that requires urgent consideration. This study aimed to explore the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of IAC and identify prognostic factors in a cancer centre in a middle-income country over 10 years. A retrospective cohort observational study of adults diagnosed with IAC was conducted at the Instituto do Cancer do Estado de São Paulo (ICESP), a tertiary hospital specialising in oncological diseases with 499 beds, including 85 intensive care unit (ICU) beds, from December 2009 through May 2021. A total of 128 episodes were included: 67.2% admitted to the ICU; 54.7% males; and median age 62 years. The predominant diagnosis was peritonitis (75.8%). Blood culture samples were collected from 128 patients upon admission, revealing candidemia in 17.2% (22). The most frequently isolated were C. albicans (n = 65, 50.8%) and C. glabrata (n = 42, 32.8%). Antifungal treatment was administered to 91 (71%) patients, with fluconazole (64.8%) and echinocandins (23.4%) being the most common choices. A significant proportion of these patients had a history of abdominal surgery or antibiotic use. Independent factors associated with 30-day mortality included the median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 6 (OR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.094-1.562, p = 0.003), days of treatment (median 10.5) (OR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.870-0.993, p = 0.031) and abdominal source control (78.1%) (OR = 0.148, 95% CI 0.030-0.719, p = 0.018). The 30-day mortality rate was 41.1%. Our study underscores the critical importance of implementing effective source control as a key strategy for reducing mortality in IAC."

    "abstract": "A man in his early 30s presenting with chest pain was admitted for the management of acute pericarditis and evaluation of a subcarinal mass incidentally noted on chest imaging. Shortly after admission, he developed cardiac tamponade. Emergent pericardiocentesis revealed purulent pericardial fluid with polymicrobial anaerobic bacteria, raising concern for gastrointestinal source and broad intravenous antibiotics were given. The pericardial fluid reaccumulated despite an indwelling pericardial drain and intrapericardial fibrinolytic therapy, necessitating a surgical pericardial window. Concurrent fluoroscopic oesophagram demonstrated oesophageal perforation with fistulous connection to the subcarinal mass and mediastinal drain, suggestive of oesophagopericardial fistula. Pathology from biopsy of the subcarinal mass returned with focal large necrotising granulomas consistent with histoplasmosis. Antifungal treatment was initiated, and the patient was eventually discharged home with nasogastric feeding tube and oral antibiotics and antifungals. This is the first reported case of polymicrobial pericarditis secondary to acquired oesophagopericardial fistula likely induced by mediastinal histoplasma lymphadenitis."

    "abstract": "Performing emergency surgery for bowel obstruction continues to place a significant strain on the healthcare system. Conventional assessment methods for outcomes in bowel obstruction cases often concentrate on isolated factors, and the evaluation of results for individuals with bowel obstruction remains poorly studied. This study aimed to examine the risk factors associated with major postoperative complications. We retrospectively analyzed 99 patients undergoing surgery from 2015 to 2022. We divided the patients into two groups: (1) benign-related obstruction (n = 68) and (2) cancer-related obstruction (n = 31). We used logistic regression, KNN, and XGBOOST. We calculated the receiver operating characteristic curve and accuracy of the model. Colon obstructions were more frequent in the cancer group (p = 0.005). Operative time, intestinal resection, and stoma were significantly more frequent in the cancer group. Major complications were at 41% for the cancer group vs. 20% in the benign group (p = 0.03). Uni- and multivariate analysis showed that the significant risk factors for major complications were cancer-related obstruction and CRP. The best model was KNN, with an accuracy of 0.82. Colonic obstruction is associated with tumor-related blockage. Malignant cancer and an increase in C-reactive protein (CRP) are significant risk factors for patients who have undergone emergency surgery due to major complications. KNN could improve the process of counseling and the perioperative management of patients with intestinal obstruction in emergency settings."

    "abstract": "Uterine perforation represents an uncommon yet potentially significant complication that may arise during the process of dilation and curettage (D&C), a frequently conducted procedure employed for a variety of gynaecological indications, including missed abortion. This report delineates an atypical case of uterine perforation in a 30-year-old female patient who underwent D&C subsequent to a missed abortion at 10 weeks of gestation and subsequently experienced acute abdominal discomfort accompanied by clinical features of internal haemorrhage shortly after the intervention. Diagnostic imaging corroborated the occurrence of uterine perforation, prompting the execution of emergency surgery to rectify the perforation and address concomitant complications. Following the surgical intervention, the patient achieved a complete recovery. This case report underscores the necessity for heightened vigilance during D&C procedures. The early identification and swift surgical management of this condition are imperative to avert severe morbidity or mortality associated with this infrequent complication. Furthermore, it accentuates the importance of pre-operative counselling and post-operative surveillance to ensure the timely identification and management of potential complications."

    "abstract": "Abdominal surgical emergencies have a high mortality rate. Effective management primarily relies on the early identification of patients at high risk of postoperative complications. The objective of our study was to determine the prognostic factors associated with poor outcomes from abdominal surgical emergencies in Senegal and to establish a predictive score for mortality for preoperative risk evaluation (NDAR (New Death Assessment Risk) score). This was a retrospective national cross-sectional study conducted over one year in 14 regions of Senegal. Adult patients (aged > 15 years) who presented with a traumatic or non-traumatic abdominal surgical emergency were included. The studied variables included clinical and paraclinical data. The variable of interest was death within 30 days of the surgery. Logistic regression was used to identify the factors independently associated with mortality. Risk factors identified after logistic regression analysis were weighted using odds ratio (OR) values rounded to the nearest whole number. The predictive capacity of the score was evaluated by analyzing the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve based on the area under the curve (AUC). A total of 1114 patient records were included, with a mortality rate of 4.4%. Diagnoses were observed in patients included appendicitis in 39.8% of cases (n = 444), followed by peritonitis in 22.3% (n = 249), intestinal obstruction in 18.5% (n = 205), strangulated hernias in 10.5% (n = 117), and abdominal trauma in 6.1%. Logistic regression, established the following scores: age > 40 years (score 2), ASA status grade 2 or higher (score 1), presence of a positive QSIRS score (score 2), diagnosis of peritonitis (score 2), diagnosis of intestinal obstruction (score 1), and the presence of intestinal necrosis (score 3). The score is positive if the total is strictly greater than 5, indicating a 17.7% risk of mortality. This score had a high predictive capacity with an AUC of 0.7397. This study enabled the establishment of a score that allows for the early identification of at-risk patients, even in constrained resource settings, facilitating appropriate perioperative management and timely surgical intervention to reduce the risk of complications. This approach, focused on early recognition of high-risk patients, is crucial for improving clinical outcomes in abdominal surgical emergencies."

    "abstract": "Abdominal ultrasound is used for diagnosing appendicitis in patients with right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Between 45 and 82% of radiology performed ultrasounds are indeterminate for appendicitis and computed tomography is required for diagnostic confirmation. Our study aims to determine predictors to rule out appendicitis when ultrasound is indeterminate. We performed a health records review of adult emergency department (ED) patients presenting with symptoms suspicious for appendicitis and indeterminate ultrasound to two academic EDs between June 2019 and July 2020. The outcome was appendicitis diagnosis within 30 days of the index ED visit. We used multivariable logistic regression, identifying a cut-off threshold for continuous variables with cubic spline, and chose the parsimonious model to develop a binary decision rule. We report Odds ratios (OR) and diagnostic performance with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Overall, 463 patients (mean age 30.3 years (SD 10.5 years), 74.9% female) were included. Appendicitis was diagnosed in 45 patients (9.7% [95% CI 7.2-12.8%]). After ultrasound, computed tomography was performed in 227 patients (49.0%) and 39 patients (17.2%) were diagnosed with appendicitis. Among the 236 patients who did not have a subsequent computed tomography, 6 (2.6%) patients had appendicitis. Neutrophil count > 5.5 × 109/L (OR 1.21 [95% CI 1.12-1.30]) and secondary signs of inflammation on ultrasound (OR 2.16 [1.07-4.37]) were associated with a higher likelihood of appendicitis (C-statistic 0.77 [95% CI 0.70-0.84]). The absence of both predictors had a sensitivity of 88.9% (95% CI 76.0-96.3%), specificity of 45.7% (95% CI 40.8-50.6%) and a negative predictive value of 0.97 (95% CI 0.94-0.99) to rule out appendicitis. For patients suspected of appendicitis and indeterminate ultrasound, the absence of an elevated neutrophil count and secondary signs of inflammation are associated with a low probability of appendicitis. RéSUMé: OBJECTIFS: Les échographies abdominales sont utilisées pour diagnostiquer l’appendicite chez les patients souffrant de douleurs abdominales du quadrant inférieur droit. Entre 45 et 82 % des examens radiologiques effectués sont indéterminés pour l’appendicite, et une tomographie est nécessaire pour confirmer le diagnostic. Notre étude vise à déterminer les prédicteurs permettant d’exclure l’appendicite lorsque l’échographie est indéterminée. MéTHODES: Nous avons effectué un examen des dossiers de santé des patients adultes du service d’urgence (DE) présentant des symptômes suspects d’appendicite et une échographie indéterminée à deux ED universitaires entre juin 2019 et juillet 2020. Le résultat était un diagnostic d’appendicite dans les 30 jours suivant la visite de l’index ED. Nous avons utilisé la régression logistique multivariable, en identifiant un seuil de coupure pour les variables continues avec une spline cubique, et choisi le modèle parcimonieux pour développer une règle de décision binaire. Nous rapportons les rapports de cotes (OR) et la performance diagnostique avec des intervalles de confiance à 95 % (IC). RéSULTATS: Dans l’ensemble, 463 patients (âge moyen 30,3 ans (SD 10,5 ans), 74,9 % de sexe féminin) ont été inclus. Une appendicite a été diagnostiquée chez 45 patients (9,7 % [IC à 95 % 7,2 %-12,8 %]). Après échographie, une tomodensitométrie a été réalisée chez 227 patients (49,0 %) et 39 patients (17,2 %) ont reçu un diagnostic d’appendicite. Parmi les 236 patients qui n’ont pas subi de tomographie, six (2,6 %) présentaient une appendicite. Le nombre de neutrophiles > 5,5x109/L (OR 1,21 [IC à 95 % 1,12-1,30]) et les signes secondaires d’inflammation à l’échographie (OR 2,16 [1,07-4,37]) étaient associés à une probabilité plus élevée d’appendicite (statistique C 0,77 [IC à 95 % 0,70-0,84]). L’absence des deux prédicteurs avait une sensibilité de 88,9 % (IC à 95 %, 76,0 %-96,3 %), une spécificité de 45,7 % (IC à 95 %, 40,8 %-50,6 %) et une valeur prédictive négative de 0,97 (IC à 95 %, 0,94 %, 0,99 %) pour exclure l’appendicite. CONCLUSION: Chez les patients suspectés d’appendicite et d’échographie indéterminée, l’absence de taux élevé de neutrophiles et de signes secondaires d’inflammation sont associés à une faible probabilité d’appendicite."

    "abstract": "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) is a nonischemic cardiomyopathy characterized by chest pain, typically manifesting transient left ventricular (LV) apical akinesis, and ischemic electrocardiographic changes, mimicking acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Although ventricular septal perforation (VSP) is a rare complication of TCM, it is potentially life-threatening if left untreated. Whether the conventional electrocardiographic criteria for TCM are beneficial, even in patients of TCM with VSP, remains unclear. An 87-year-old woman was admitted for worsening dyspnea. Elevated serum cardiac enzyme levels, LV dysfunction on echocardiography, and ST-segment elevation in leads V1-4 on electrocardiogram were initially suggestive of ACS. An emergency coronary angiography revealed 90 % focal stenosis of the mid-portion of the right coronary artery (RCA) with Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction flow grade 2. However, left ventriculography revealed LV apical ballooning with a coexisting left-to-right shunting, which was beyond single RCA distributions, leading to a final diagnosis of TCM with VSP. Repeat echocardiography confirmed VSP and right ventricular involvement with severe pulmonary hypertension. Following successful percutaneous coronary intervention with a drug-eluting stent for RCA stenosis, the patient was managed with medical treatment without surgical intervention. Eventually, VSP and associated pulmonary hypertension markedly improved along with the normalization of the patient's cardiac structure and function. The patient's clinical course was uneventful at the 1-year follow-up. Herein, we describe the case of TCM with VSP that we successfully managed with medical treatments. Our case highlights the significance of elucidating this rare complication of TCM, pitfalls of the conventional electrocardiographic diagnostic criteria for TCM, and potential of this unique electrocardiographic pattern for identifying TCM-associated VSP."

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) methods can identify complex patterns of treatment effect heterogeneity. However, before ML can help to personalize decision making, transparent approaches must be developed that draw on clinical judgment. We develop an approach that combines clinical judgment with ML to generate appropriate comparative effectiveness evidence for informing decision making. We motivate this approach in evaluating the effectiveness of nonemergency surgery (NES) strategies, such as antibiotic therapy, for people with acute appendicitis who have multiple long-term conditions (MLTCs) compared with emergency surgery (ES). Our 4-stage approach 1) draws on clinical judgment about which patient characteristics and morbidities modify the relative effectiveness of NES; 2) selects additional covariates from a high-dimensional covariate space (P > 500) by applying an ML approach, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), to large-scale administrative data (N = 24,312); 3) generates estimates of comparative effectiveness for relevant subgroups; and 4) presents evidence in a suitable form for decision making. This approach provides useful evidence for clinically relevant subgroups. We found that overall NES strategies led to increases in the mean number of days alive and out-of-hospital compared with ES, but estimates differed across subgroups, ranging from 21.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.8 to 40.5) for patients with chronic heart failure and chronic kidney disease to -10.4 (-29.8 to 9.1) for patients with cancer and hypertension. Our interactive tool for visualizing ML output allows for findings to be customized according to the specific needs of the clinical decision maker. This principled approach of combining clinical judgment with an ML approach can improve trust, relevance, and usefulness of the evidence generated for clinical decision making. Machine learning (ML) methods have many potential applications in medical decision making, but the lack of model interpretability and usability constitutes an important barrier for the wider adoption of ML evidence in practice.We develop a 4-stage approach for integrating clinical judgment into the way an ML approach is used to estimate and report comparative effectiveness.We illustrate the approach in undertaking an evaluation of nonemergency surgery (NES) strategies for acute appendicitis in patients with multiple long-term conditions and find that NES strategies lead to better outcomes compared with emergency surgery and that the effects differ across subgroups.We develop an interactive tool for visualizing the results of this study that allows findings to be customized according to the user's preferences."

    "abstract": "Closed-loop bowel obstruction and contained perforation secondary to acute on chronic jejunal diverticulitis is rare and should be included in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen. The association between polymyalgia rheumatica and diverticular disease requires further research but may prompt clinicians to consider appropriate therapies in patients with both diseases. Jejunal diverticulosis is a sac-like outpouching of the intestinal wall that can cause complications such as diverticulitis, obstruction, abscess, perforation, or fistula formation. Complicated jejunal diverticulosis may present with acute abdomen and nonspecific symptoms which can lead to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. A 76-year-old male with a remote history of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) presented with sudden onset abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, and inability to pass flatus. Physical exam revealed a distended and diffusely tender abdomen with signs of peritonitis. Laboratory test results were significant for neutrophil-dominant leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers. CT scan of the abdomen with IV contrast revealed a contained perforation and a closed-loop small bowel obstruction in the mid-abdomen. The patient underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy and resection of 100 cm of mid-jejunum which was found to have numerous diverticula surrounding the closed-loop obstruction and contained perforation. Pathology findings showed evidence of acute on chronic jejunal diverticulitis. Jejunal diverticulosis with complications may present with an acute abdomen and peritonitis. Closed-loop bowel obstruction and contained perforation secondary to acute on chronic jejunal diverticulitis is uncommonly thought of and should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Additionally, the association between PMR and diverticular disease is notable. While the patient had a remote history but no active PMR on presentation, studies suggest a possible association between gut inflammation and rheumatologic disease. This association should prompt clinicians to consider appropriate therapies and bear in mind the potential risk for diverticular perforation if glucocorticoids are given to treat PMR. Jejunal diverticulosis with multiple complications such as closed-loop bowel obstruction and contained perforation secondary to acute on chronic jejunal diverticulitis is rare and may present with an acute abdomen and nonspecific symptoms. Including rare pathologies as such in the differential diagnosis may prevent misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. While further investigation is needed, the association between diverticulosis and PMR is noteworthy as patients who present with both diseases would require mindful management due to the potential risk of diverticular perforation after treatment with steroids."

    "abstract": "Obturator hernia is a rare condition. Preoperative diagnosis is difficult to achieve because the hernia swelling is rarely palpable. Diagnosis is often delayed, and the hernia can become fatal if intestinal strangulation occurs, especially in older patients. Hesitation in the intervention will result in perforation, peritonitis, sepsis, and death. We herein report a case involving a Japanese woman in her 90s who visited our emergency room with nausea and right inner thigh pain. Computed tomography (CT) at onset revealed intestinal incarceration between the piriformis and external obturator muscles; therefore, a right-sided obturator hernia was diagnosed. Manual release of the incarceration, combined with echo probe manipulation and lower extremity movement, was successfully performed. The patient's pain was dramatically reduced, and emergency surgery was avoided. A prompt hernia release after reaching the correct diagnosis is very important for obturator hernia patients. Scheduled minimally invasive surgery (transabdominal pre-peritoneal repair, TAPP) was subsequently performed. Intraoperatively, a coexistence of ipsilateral femoral hernia was detected by laparoscope. Therefore, we tried to cover not only the obturator canal but also the subclinical coexistence of ipsilateral groin hernias. All four hernia orifices (obturator hernia orifice, internal inguinal hernia orifice, external inguinal hernia orifice, and femoral hernia orifice) were covered at the same time with a single large mesh of 15 × 10 cm. Reports detailing such approaches (total and simultaneous coverage of the obturator canal and myopectineal orifice with one rectangular mesh) are relatively rare in the literature."

Pediatric hospitalizations for acute appendicitis in 2022 were extracted from the Brazilian national database. We included all hospitalizations for patients aged 0-16 years with a primary ICD-10 diagnosis of acute appendicitis who underwent an operation. Parameters of interest were the type of surgical approach, mortality, and total cost of hospitalization. Facilities were defined as basic-facility, full-facility, and pediatric according to the level of pediatric resources available. In 2022, there were 29,983 pediatric appendectomies due to acute appendicitis. Of these, 90.2% were open appendectomies. Most occurred in basic-facility general hospitals (53.0%), followed by full-facility (35.2%) and pediatric hospitals (11.8%). Full-facility hospitals had a higher median cost (USD126.3, IQR 99.5-154.4) compared to basic (USD96.8, IQR 87.6-130.1) and pediatric hospitals (USD103.0, IQR 91.9-117.5), though the cost difference between basic and pediatric was not significant (p = 0.367). Death was a rare event across all levels of hospital infrastructure and for all types of procedures performed. The majority of hospitalizations for acute appendicitis occurred in hospitals with minimal pediatric infrastructure. Open appendectomies remain the most predominant procedure across all hospital types."

We aimed to establish a scoring model based on objective findings (excluding computed tomography findings) for the diagnosis of colorectal perforation and its differentiation from gastroduodenal perforation. Patients diagnosed with colorectal or gastroduodenal perforations between January 2014 and December 2021 were retrospectively studied. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent variables, and a scoring model was developed based on these variables. Among 131 eligible patients, 64 (48.9%) were in the colorectal group and 67 (51.1%) were in the gastroduodenal group. White blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score were identified as independent clinical variables associated with the diagnosis of colorectal perforation, which differentiated colorectal perforation from gastroduodenal perforation, and were used to develop a new scoring model. The scores ranged from 0 to 5, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.846. The probabilities of colorectal perforation with scores of 0, 1.5, 2, 3, 3.5, and 5 were 3.2, 20, 55.6, 81.8, 73.9, and 82.4%, respectively. The new scoring model may help in treatment selection and perioperative management of patients with gastrointestinal perforation."

    "abstract": "Acute otitis media with discharge (AOMd) results from a tympanic membrane perforation secondary to a middle ear infection. Currently, the impact of AOMd on children and young people (CYP) and their families is not well understood. There is also a need to explore the experience of healthcare professionals in treating AOMd. Interviews with CYP and their parents, and focus groups with medical professionals, were conducted to explore these objectives. A total of 26 parents of CYP (age range: 7 months to 15 years) with a history of AOMd (within the last year) and 28 medical professionals were recruited across the UK between August 2023 and March 2024. Healthcare professionals were from primary care (n=17), ear, nose and throat (ENT) (n=7) and emergency medicine (n=4) backgrounds. Thematic analysis was performed independently by three reviewers. The majority of CYP (n=25/26) (96.2%) had suffered from multiple episodes of AOMd. AOMd has a physical, psychological, educational, financial and social impact on CYP and their parents. Parents found accessing healthcare services and information difficult, which increased parental anxiety. Antibiotic overuse was also a concern among parents. The majority of general practitioners and emergency care staff described using oral amoxicillin, compared with ENT doctors who predominantly prescribed topical antibiotics. AOMd has a significant impact on CYP and their parent's daily lives. Need for clear, easily accessible patient information was identified as a priority by the parents of CYP with AOMd. Evidence-based management guidelines should be developed once high-quality evidence is available. ISCTRN43760."

    "title": "Early Operative Risk Assessment Using the Modified Mannheim Peritonitis Index in Patients With Generalised Peritonitis at a Tertiary Hospital in Abuja, Nigeria.",
    "abstract": "Introduction The use of validated prognostic scoring tools in resource-poor environments has been hampered by the cost of procuring and maintaining devices, such as arterial blood gas analysers, to measure critical physiological derangements. Attempts need to be made to adapt these applicable risk stratification tools so they can be easily adopted in developing countries like Nigeria.  Aim This study assessed the usefulness of a modified Mannheim peritonitis index (mMPI) as a risk stratification tool in predicting surgical outcomes in managing patients with generalised peritonitis in Abuja, Nigeria. Methods This was a prospective study of consecutive adult patients managed for generalised peritonitis at a tertiary hospital in Abuja over 12 months. Approval numbers NHA/EC/037/2019 and AF/013/17/110/1514 were ascribed to the project by the Institute Review Board Committee (IBR) of the National Hospital Abuja (NHA) and the National Postgraduate Medical College of Nigeria. The MPI was modified using respiratory rate and suboptimal percentage oxygen saturation (SpO2). Patient characteristics and treatment outcomes obtained were entered into a structured proforma, checked, and analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25.0 (Released 2017; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States). The threshold score of the modified MPI and the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were derived from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and its coordinates. The level of statistical significance was set at a p-value of <0.05. Results There were 49 patients with generalised peritonitis during the study period with a male-to-female ratio of 2.5:1. The commonest cause of peritonitis in this study was penetrating abdominal injury (n=15, 30.6%), followed by complicated appendicitis (n=12, 24.5%). This study's mortality and morbidity rates were 14.3% and 63.3%, respectively. On the ROC curve, the modified MPI best predicts mortality at a threshold score point of ≥26 (accuracy of 79.4%, sensitivity of 85.7%, specificity of 61.9%, p=0.013) and morbidity at a threshold score of ≥23 (accuracy of 78.4%, sensitivity of 77.4%, specificity of 72.2%, p=0.001).  Conclusion The modified MPI can be used as a risk assessment tool to predict postoperative outcomes in adult patients operated on for generalised peritonitis within 30 days of operative intervention at Abuja. This modification may be helpful in low-resource centres with limited access to arterial blood gas analysers. However, the original MPI might be a more accurate tool."

    "title": "Multifocal Infarction Along the Alimentary Canal in the Context of Ostensible Salmonellosis: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Ischemic and/or infarction events of the alimentary canal are uncommon but potentially disastrous injuries of the digestive system that often portend a poor prognosis. Alimentary ischemia occurs when the vascular supply to one of the component conduit organs is disrupted or blocked, resulting in decreased tissue perfusion, subsequent necrosis, perforation, and even death if proper perfusion is not restored. We report a case here of a 67-year-old female who originally presented to the emergency department (ED) with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and progressively worsening abdominal pain. Conservative therapies that were initially employed failed to provide lasting symptom relief, and the patient was admitted for a more in-depth diagnostic workup and closer monitoring. During subsequent days of her resulting hospital stay, the patient had a positive result for Salmonella spp. on a stool PCR assay, an increasing leukocytosis, and the presence of several other worrisome laboratory abnormalities. Despite appropriate antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation efforts, the patient's abdominal pain and laboratory profile continued to progressively worsen. At one point, the patient's condition perilously worsened, necessitating an emergent exploratory laparotomy. During the course of this surgery and subsequent surgeries, the patient was found to have multiple areas of infarction present including at her esophagus, stomach, duodenum, proximal jejunum, and right colon. Additionally, evidence of a metastatic neuroendocrine tumor of gastrointestinal (GI) origin was also incidentally found. Several subsequent surgical operations were required to repair the extensive tissue damage that the patient had sustained, and the patient's resulting hospital stay was complicated repeatedly by several different secondary infections and surgical complications. Attempts to determine the underlying cause for the ischemic events this patient experienced failed to yield definitive results, and no evidence for any arterial insufficiency or emboli was ever discovered. Despite this, a review of the histopathologic and laboratory findings from the tissue resected from the patient did find information to suggest that a relatively localized but severe venous thrombotic process likely occurred in the patient's alimentary vasculature that directly led to her presentation. Venous thrombosis of the mesenteric vessels and in the other vascular planes of the alimentary canal is often insidious in its presentation and poses a unique diagnostic challenge to clinicians. This case is significant because it illustrates the diagnostic complexity and difficulty imposed by mesenteric ischemia, especially cases resulting from mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT) due to their often more indolent and atypical presentation. In short, a high level of clinical suspicion and familiarity with this ailment and its risk factors should be maintained because, in the absence of timely intervention, significant morbidity and/or mortality are likely to result."

    "abstract": "Small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) is a relatively rare disease that is difficult to detect in the early stages; therefore, it often has a poor prognosis. We present a rare case of SBA and multiple liver metastases in a patient who underwent curative resection combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). A 70-year-old woman presented to the emergency department complaining of abdominal pain and bloating. She was diagnosed with bowel obstruction due to a primary jejunal tumor and was admitted to the hospital. After further imaging and histopathological examination, the patient was diagnosed with primary jejunal adenocarcinoma with multiple liver metastases, all of which were considered resectable. Since she had developed bowel obstruction due to the primary tumor, jejunal resection with draining lymph node removal was initially performed. The remaining multiple liver metastases were treated with four courses of capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CAPEOX) with bevacizumab as NAC, followed by hepatectomy. After NAC, the patient underwent radical liver resection. Based on a pathological examination, the five liver tumors were all diagnosed as liver metastases from jejunal adenocarcinoma. Six months after the liver resection, a single recurrence was observed in segment V of the liver. Therefore, four courses of CAPEOX with bevacizumab were administered again as NAC, and liver resection was performed again. At the time of writing this report, she has survived for more than four years after the first surgery, with no apparent recurrence. This is a rare case of a patient who underwent radical resection of SBA with multiple liver metastases following CAPEOX and bevacizumab as NAC."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis, a common medical emergency, primarily affects children, and its diagnosis can be challenging. In addition to methods such as abdominal ultrasound, predictive clinical scales are used, such as the Alvarado scale and others, which categorize risk in pediatric patients. Given the lack of consensus on exact criteria, this review seeks to identify and analyze 22 prediction scales used in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in children. The search was carried out according to the PRISMA guide, resulting in 73 articles selected from a total of 1521, with inclusion criteria focused on the pediatric population and integrated scales. The importance of predictive scales for appendicitis in children is highlighted, which incorporate clinical history, physical examination, laboratory and images to guide surgical intervention decisions. Among the most used worldwide were the Alvarado and Tzanakis scales, PAS and Heidelberg Appendicitis Score (HAS), designed specifically for pediatric patients. Острый аппендицит — это распространенное неотложное состояние, чаще встречающееся у детей. Диагностика острого аппендицита может быть затруднительной. В дополнение к ультразвуковым методам используют прогностические клинические шкалы, такие как шкала Alvarado и др., для оценки риска у детей. Учитывая отсутствие консенсуса по точным критериям, в этом обзоре авторы попытались проанализировать 22 прогностические шкалы, используемые при диагностике острого аппендицита у детей. Поиск проводили в соответствии с критериями PRISMA. В результате отобраны 73 из 1521 статьи с критериями включения, ориентированными на детскую популяцию и интегрированные шкалы. Подчеркивается важность прогностических шкал в отношении аппендицита у детей, которые включают анамнез, физикальное обследование, лабораторные данные и визуализацию для принятия решений о хирургическом вмешательстве.

    "abstract": "To determine the criteria for choosing surgical access in patients with advanced peritonitis considering its local and general manifestations. We analyzed treatment outcomes in 588 patients with advanced peritonitis. The most common causes of peritonitis were destructive forms of acute appendicitis (273 cases), perforated gastroduodenal ulcers (165 cases), acute cholecystitis (59 cases). To determine the criteria for choosing surgical access in advanced peritonitis, we analyzed treatment outcomes considering MPI, SPP and WSES SSS score. The choice of surgical access in advanced peritonitis can only symbolically be standardized according to modern scoring systems (MPI, SPP, WSES SSS). Laparotomy is necessary for MPI score ≥30 and SPP score > 10 (WSES SSS score > 8). Regardless of MPI, SPP, WSES SSS scores, the absolute contraindications for laparoscopic surgery are dense non-removable fibrin deposits, interintestinal abscesses, purulent recesses, intra-abdominal pressure > 20 mm Hg or small intestine dilation> 3 cm, sepsis or septic shock (qSOFA score 2-3), previous open abdominal surgery, unstable hemodynamics, technical difficulties. Conversion should be used at any doubt. Careful patient selection, surgical experience and training in laparoscopic technique are decisive factors for wider use of laparoscopic approach in patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery. Определение критериев для выбора оперативного доступа у больных с распространенным перитонитом, исходя из его местных и общих проявлений. Работа основана на анализе результатов лечения 588 пациентов с окончательным диагнозом распространенного перитонита. Наиболее частыми причинами развития перитонита были: деструктивные формы острого аппендицита (273 наблюдения), перфорация гастродуоденальных язв (165), острый холецистит (59). С целью определения критерия для выбора оперативного доступа при распространенном перитоните установили исходы лечения в зависимости от балла Мангеймского индекса перитонита (МИП), системы прогноза перитонита (СПП) и WSES SSS. Выбор оперативного доступа при распространенном перитоните лишь символически может быть стандартизирован по имеющимся системам и шкалам тяжести данного осложнения (МИП, СПП, WSES SSS). При баллах 30 и более по МИП и >10 по СПП (а также >8 баллов по WSES SSS) единственным обоснованным доступом является лапаротомия. При этом, независимо от балла МИП, СПП, WSES SSS, абсолютными противопоказаниями к проведению лапароскопической операции являются: плотные неснимаемые наложения фибрина, межкишечные абсцессы, гнойные карманы, внутрибрюшное давление >20 мм рт.ст. или расширение диаметра тонкой кишки свыше 3 см, сепсис или септический шок (qSOFA 2—3 балла), открытые операции на верхнем этаже брюшной полости в анамнезе, нестабильная гемодинамика, технические трудности. Конверсию следует использовать при малейших сомнениях. Тщательный отбор пациентов, опыт хирурга и обучение лапароскопической технике остаются решающими факторами для более широкого применения лапароскопического подхода у пациентов в неотложной общей хирургии. Конверсию следует использовать при малейших сомнениях."

While typically asymptomatic or presenting as a respiratory tract infection, rare cases of disseminated infection to the peritoneum have been reported. The patient in this case study presented with a small bowel obstruction, requiring an exploratory laparoscopy showing evidence of an inflammatory mass with a jejuna-colic fistula with adherence to the spleen. The patient underwent splenectomy with a cholecystectomy and small bowel resection. Intraabdominal cultures revealed Coccidioides, and so he started long-term antifungal treatment. The patient was also initiated on salvage chemotherapy for DLBCL, and ultimately received CAR T-Cell therapy at a tertiary center. This case report highlights a unique presentation of gastrointestinal Coccidioides infection, in the setting of an immunocompromised host with a hematologic malignancy. It also provides insight into the therapeutic challenges clinicians face when treating complicated patients such as this who require urgent chemotherapy while risking further immunosuppression in the setting of active infection."

This report presents a case of EPT incidentally discovered in the submucosal area of the small intestine. A 56-year-old male presented to the emergency department following a high-speed car collision, reporting abdominal pain after impact with the steering wheel. Physical examination revealed left upper quadrant tenderness. Imaging studies showed free fluid in the abdominal and pelvic cavities, mesenteric damage, and increased intestinal wall thickness. Surgical exploration confirmed hemoperitoneum and a non-viable 30 cm segment of the small intestine, which was resected. Subsequent pathological examination revealed a 1.5 cm submucosal mass, diagnosed as EPT. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged in stable condition. Clinically significant lesions are typically larger than 1.5 cm and involve the mucosa, with pain as the most common symptom. They can also cause severe complications such as intestinal obstruction, perforation, peritonitis, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Additionally, EPT can be associated with malignant transformations. While often asymptomatic, EPT can lead to significant complications, making surgical resection essential for both symptomatic and incidental cases, particularly since diagnosis is frequently established postoperatively through histological examination. Although trauma may not directly cause EPT, its management in emergency settings can facilitate evaluations that reveal lesions capable of causing severe complications if left undiagnosed. Given the diverse symptoms associated with this condition, EPT should be considered in the differential diagnosis of intestinal lesions."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is one of the commonest causes of acute abdominal pain presenting to emergency department (ED) and Computerized Tomography scan (CT) is considered gold standard for its diagnosis. Internationally Low Dose Computerized Tomography scan (LDCT) in emergency department is recommended as a beneficial tool to diagnose acute appendicitis with less exposure to radiation and reduction in the rate of negative laparotomy. Local trials are needed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of LDCT as the first line imaging test for acute appendicitis. Our objective was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of LDCT as the first line imaging test for acute appendicitis. An observational study was conducted over a sample of 147 patients presented with suspected acute appendicitis to the emergency department of Ziauddin University Hospital, Karachi from November 2018 till May 2019. Non-probability consecutive technique used. Aged ≥ 16 years presented in emergency department with the history (symptoms) and physical examination (Signs) suspecting acute appendicitis were included. Patients with contraindications to CT scan e.g. pregnant women. Patients with signs of Acute Peritonitis requiring immediate surgery. CT scan refused by the patient or patient's attendant were excluded. Histopathology was the gold standard in diagnosing acute appendicitis. The data was analyzed using open epi sample size calculator. One hundred forty six patients had positive findings on LDCT for acute appendicitis (99.3%) whereas only one patient had negative findings (0.7%). The sensitivity and specificity of LDCT for the detection of acute appendicitis were estimated as 96.45% and 16.67% by taking histopathology as gold standard. Negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) were estimated as 16.67% and 96.45% respectively. The overall accuracy of LDCT was 93.88%. Our study showed that for diagnosing acute appendicitis, LDCT is harmless, fast and economical imaging modality and has diagnostic accuracy with decrease in radiation dose."

    "abstract": "A small bowel obstruction (SBO) involves partial or complete blockage of the small intestine. Complete high-grade or closed-loop obstructions constitute acute surgical emergencies necessitating urgent intervention to prevent severe complications. Several probable etiologies of SBO have been identified, including malignancy, stool impaction, and inflammatory bowel disease; however, post-surgical adhesion is the most prevalent cause in the developed world. A SBO can be diagnosed clinically after a physical examination, but imaging is needed for surgical assessment and management. Misdiagnosis and inadequate management of SBO can cause several complications, such as intestinal necrosis and perforation. Therefore, when required, rapid diagnosis and surgical intervention are critical to avoiding mortality. Computer tomography (CT) and small bowel follow-through (SBFT) are widely utilized imaging modalities for confirmatory diagnosis of SBO. This case series features three patients who had exploratory laparotomies following extensive clinical evaluations and a radiologically confirmed diagnosis of SBO. All three cases involved numerous surgeries. The patients presented with severe abdominal discomfort and received surgical intervention after a CT scan confirmed the diagnosis and conservative therapy failed. In this case, all patients had different presentations but responded adequately to the same treatment modalities with no postoperative complications."

    "abstract": "A 67-year-old male presented to us with symptoms of postprandial abdominal pain for the last 3 months and was not able to take meals for the last month. The computed tomography (CT) angiogram showed complete occlusion in the coeliac artery (CA), superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) with complete occlusion of infrarenal aorta and bilateral iliac arteries. While waiting for elective surgical mesenteric bypass, patient suddenly developed signs of peritonitis for which emergency surgery was done using a Dacron bifurcated graft 12 × 6 mm size. Inflow was taken from the supra coeliac aorta. At 6 months follow-up, the patient was doing well and the CT angiogram showed a patent graft. In our case, the challenge was from where to take inflow, as the patient's aorta was atherosclerotic and infrarenal aorta was completely occluded, and he was also not suitable for endovascular stenting. So, we decided to take inflow from the supra coeliac aorta and a distally mesenteric bypass was done. Although mesenteric ischaemia has very high morbidity and mortality rates, prompt and well-planned mesenteric bypass surgery can save both bowel and patients life as well."

    "abstract": "Leukocytosis and thrombocytosis often follow splenectomy in blunt trauma patients, complicating the postoperative identification of infection. While the platelet count to white blood cell ratio provides diagnostic assistance to discern between expected laboratory alterations and infection, diagnoses such as leukemia are often overlooked. A 53-year-old Hispanic male presented with abdominal pain, nausea, tachycardia, and focal peritonitis 4 days after being assaulted and struck multiple times in the abdomen. Initial white blood cell count was 38.4 × 109/L, platelet count was 691 × 109/L, and lipase was 55 U/L. Computed tomography abdomen/pelvis demonstrated a hematoma encasing the distal pancreas and abutting the stomach and colon. Emergent laparotomy revealed a nearly transected pancreas and devascularized colon, necessitating a distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, and colonic resection with primary anastomosis. Postoperatively, he had a persistently elevated leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, segmented neutrophils, eosinophilia, and basophilia (peak at 70, 2293, 64, 1.1, and 1.2 × 109/L, respectively). Despite sepsis workup, including repeat computed tomography, no source was identified. Hematology/oncology was consulted for concern for hematologic etiology, with genetic testing and bone marrow biopsy performed. The diagnosis of breakpoint cluster-Abelson gene-positive chronic myeloid leukemia was made based on genetic tests, including polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, which confirmed the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome. Bone marrow biopsy suggested a chronic phase. The patient was treated with hydroxyurea and transitioned to imatinib. Thrombocytosis following splenectomy is a common complication and a plate count to white blood cell count ratio  < 20 indicates infectious etiology. A significantly elevated white blood cell count (> 50 × 109/L) and thrombocytosis (> 2000 × 109/L) may suggest something more ominous, including chronic myeloid leukemia , particularly when elevated granulocyte counts are present. Chronic myeloid leukemia workup includes peripheral smear, bone marrow aspiration, and determination of Philadelphia chromosome. Post-splenectomy vaccines are still indicated within 14 days; however, the timing of immunization with cancer treatment must be considered. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are the first-line therapy and benefits of pretreatment with hydroxyurea for cytoreduction remain under investigation. Additionally, tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been associated with gastrointestinal perforation and impaired wound healing, necessitating heightened attention in patients with a new bowel anastomosis."

Patients developed acute-onset symptoms (typically non-bloody Grade 3+ diarrhea) with negative infectious workup beginning a median of 92.5 days (range: 22-210 days) after CAR-T therapy and a median of 85 days after cytokine release syndrome resolution. Gut biopsies uniformly demonstrated inflammation, including intra-epithelial lymphocytosis and villous blunting. In one case where CAR-specific immunofluorescence stains were available, CAR T-cell presence was confirmed within the lamina propria. Systemic corticosteroids were initiated in 10 patients (71%) a median of 25.5 days following symptom onset, with symptom improvement in 40%. Subsequent infliximab or vedolizumab led to improvement in 50% and 33% of corticosteroid-refractory patients, respectively. Five patients (36%) have died from bowel perforation or treatment-emergent sepsis. In conclusion, IEC-associated enterocolitis is a distinct but rare complication of CAR-T therapy typically beginning 1-3 months after infusion. Thorough diagnostic workup is essential, including evaluation for potential T-cell malignancies. The early use of infliximab or vedolizumab may potentially hasten symptom resolution and lower reliance on high-dose corticosteroids during the post-CAR-T period."

Trial data suggest NOM of AA carries a substantial risk of subsequent appendectomy, although NOM is increasingly offered to patients. Population-based data is required to understand the real-world long-term course of patients undergoing NOM of AA. This population-based cohort study included all adult patients in Ontario, Canada who presented to any emergency department (ED) with AA between 2004-2019. Patients who did not undergo a procedure on index ED presentation or hospital admission were defined as NOM and followed for five years. The cumulative incidence of composite re-presentation or intervention (ED re-presentation, re-admission, emergency, or scheduled appendicitis procedure) was calculated accounting for competing risk of death. Of 156,362 patients identified with AA, 13,200 underwent NOM. The cumulative incidence of composite re-presentation or intervention was 33% at 1-year (95%CI 32-33%) and 36% at 5-years (95%CI 36-37%). At 5-years, the incidence of appendicitis-specific ED re-presentation or hospital re-admission was 16% (95%CI 15-16%), the incidence of an emergency procedure for AA was 12% (95%CI 12-13%), and the incidence of scheduled surgery was 21% (95%CI 20-21%). In a subgroup of patients with uncomplicated AA, composite re-presentation or intervention was 28% at 1-year (95%CI 27-29%) and 32% at 5-years (95%CI 32-33%). Real-world estimates of emergency re-presentation with or without urgent surgery following NOM of AA were lower than previously described.

New clips designed for delivery using the duodenoscope (SureClip, Micro-Tech, Nanjing, China) have been utilized for gastrointestinal bleeding hemostasis and bleeding prevention after polypectomy and papillectomy. We retrospectively analyzed the effectiveness and safety of SureClip for post-EST bleeding. Patients and methods Of 608 patients with endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST), 41 cases (6.7%) experienced post-EST bleeding from 2019 to 2023. Of these patients, 24 underwent hemostasis by SureClip, and the success rate of complete hemostasis and complication by hemostasis by SureClip was analyzed. Results In 12 and 12 patients with urgent and delayed bleeding, 11 (91.7%) and 11 (91.7%) had successful hemostasis, respectively. In addition, missed patients achieved complete hemostasis with additional transcatheter arterial embolization and balloon compression, respectively. No complications were observed, including perforation, pancreatitis, and clipping bile duct and pancreatic duct by mistake. Conclusions Hemostasis with SureClip is safe, effective, and not expensive for post-EST bleeding. It could be the first choice for hemostasis in patients with post-EST bleeding refractory to balloon compression."

    "abstract": "Since current fascial traction methods involve invasive procedures, they are generally employed late in the management of the open abdomen (OA). This study aimed to evaluate early versus late placement of a non-invasive, pressure-regulated device for fascial reapproximation and gap reduction in OA patients. The study included all patients who had the abdominal fascia intentionally left open after damage control operation for trauma and emergency general surgery and were managed with the device in an academic hospital between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2023. Time of device placement in relation to the end of index laparotomy was defined as early (≤24 hours) versus late (>24 hours). Time-related mid-incisional width reduction of the fascial gap and fascial closure were assessed using descriptive and linear regression analysis. There was a significantly higher percent reduction in the fascial gap at the midpoint of the laparotomies in the early (≤24 hours) AbClo placement group compared with the late (>24 hours) AbClo placement group, respectively, median 76% versus 43%, p<0.001. Linear regression adjusting for body mass index and the number of takebacks indicated that fascial approximation was 22% higher for early placement (β=0.22; CI 0.12, 0.33, p<0.001). Primary myofascial closure rate with early (≤24 hours) application of the device was 98% versus 85% with late application. Early non-invasive application of the device (≤24 hours) after the initial laparotomy resulted in greater reduction of the fascial gap and higher primary fascial closure rate compared with late placement (>24 hours). Early non-invasive intervention could prevent abdominal wall myofascial retraction in OA patients. IV."

    "abstract": "This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative blood transfusions in correcting anemia for pediatric patients with congenital malformations (CMs) versus those with acute abdomen (AA) conditions. The study hypothesized that the response to transfusions might vary significantly between these groups due to the differences in the underlying pathology and clinical status. The study included 107 pediatric patients admitted to Timisoara 'Louis Turcanu' Emergency Hospital for Children between January 2015 and May 2023, who required blood transfusions for preoperative anemia. Hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), and red blood cell counts (RBC) were assessed at admission, 48 h post-transfusion, and at discharge. Statistical analyses, including Student's t-test, Pearson correlation, and chi-square tests, were utilized to compare outcomes between the groups. The study population was divided into 53 children with CM and 54 with AA. Initial analyses showed that children with CM had statistically significantly higher baseline HGB (8.54 ± 1.00 g/dL vs. 7.87 ± 1.02 g/dL, p = 0.001) and HCT (26.07 ± 3.98% vs. 23.95 ± 2.90%, p = 0.002) compared to those with AA. Post-transfusion, children with CM exhibited a greater increase in HGB, with the highest increases noted in patients with central nervous system defects (mean increase of 3.67 g/dL, p = 0.038). In contrast, the increases in HGB for children with AA were less pronounced, with the highest being 2.03 g/dL in those with peritonitis (p = 0.078). No significant gender differences were noted in response to transfusion. Children with congenital malformations respond more effectively to preoperative blood transfusions compared to those with acute abdomen conditions. These findings suggest that differential transfusion strategies may be required based on the underlying medical condition to optimize the management of preoperative anemia in pediatric patients. Tailoring transfusion approaches according to specific patient needs and conditions could enhance clinical outcomes and resource utilization in pediatric surgical settings."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction secondary to adhesions in a virgin abdomen is encountered very rarely. Its rarity may cause a delay in diagnosis that can lead to complications among which is sepsis and death. In contrast, On-time diagnosis constitutes one of many pillars of the best outcome for the patient. We present a case of a 46-year-old female exhibiting symptoms of small bowel obstruction that persisted for five days. Her previous surgical history was negative. Upon testing, we found a neutrophilic leukocytosis and an abdominal x-ray revealed dilated bowel loops with multiple air-fluid levels and no air under the diaphragm with an increased pulse rate and respiratory rate. An emergency exploratory laparotomy definitively identified congenital band adhesions as the root cause of the obstruction. Abdominal x-ray is the starting investigation in rural health facilities of Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs), but lacks the ability to detect complications such as strangulation and ischemia as can the multidetector Computed Tomography scan and the Magnetic Resonance Imaging. A non-resolving small bowel obstruction or the one associated with peritonitis or bowel ischemia should undergo a surgical intervention. A negative surgical history should not annihilate the suspicion of band adhesions in small bowel obstruction. Early diagnostic imaging is helpful. When this is not possible, a laparotomy should be done if clinically indicated. The patient had an uneventful recovery."

Adolescent who was admitted to the emergency room due to intense, generalized abdominal pain, which did not go away with anything, was exacerbated with movements, 24 h later vomiting that occurred as soon as he ate food was added, and severe and progressive abdominal distention, reason for admission to the service of emergencies. He had no significant family or personal medical history. On physical examination, he was found to be sick with a painful appearance, pale, sweaty, feverish, with tachycardia, he complained of intense pain, distended abdomen, with loss of hepatic dullness, with involuntary muscular resistance, with positive rebound sign, absent peristalsis. Laboratory studies were taken that reported anemia, leukocytosis and neutrophilia, blood chemistry, electrolytes, and coagulation times within normal limits; abdominal x-rays showed subdiaphragmatic free air. The prevalence of pancreatic heterotopia in the literature varies from 0.6 % in autopsy series to 14 %, however, the increasingly frequent use of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound allows early diagnosis, since whether directed or incidentally, which avoids serious complications such as gastric perforation, because it is unusual for it to occur as in this clinical case. Specifically in the stomach, involvement of the submucosa layer has been described in 73 %, muscular layer in 17 % and subserosa in 10 % of cases respectively. In cases where the disease is in an asymptomatic stage, it can be treated conservatively; it seems to be more common in men, as in our case, than in women. In patients with chronic epigastric pain, it is essential to rule out conditions such as heterotopic pancreas, to avoid serious complications such as perforation."

    "abstract": "Midgut malrotation with volvulus is a surgical emergency with potentially devastating outcomes which include short gut syndrome necessitating long-term parenteral nutrition, overwhelming sepsis, and death. The clinical presentation is most frequently with bilious vomiting in the first days-weeks of life, which is non-specific and common. Timely imaging investigation is therefore crucial to prevent delays to diagnosis and treatment and avoid unnecessary surgical exploration in infants with non-surgical bilious vomiting. Fluoroscopic upper gastrointestinal contrast series (UGI) has been the first-line imaging modality to investigate midgut malrotation at pediatric surgical centers worldwide. However, there is a growing body of evidence to indicate that ultrasound (US) has greater diagnostic accuracy than UGI in this context. Furthermore, US offers the benefits of accessibility, portability, lack of ionizing radiation, and the ability to identify alternative diagnoses, and is beginning to attract significant attention and consideration in the literature. Over the last 3 years, we have transitioned to an \"US-first\" pathway for the investigation of midgut malrotation in infants with bilious vomiting. This pictorial essay illustrates our comprehensive approach, describes unique troubleshooting techniques, and highlights the variably published pitfalls we have encountered with the aim of encouraging wider adoption."

During COVID-19 pandemic, this disease presented in pediatric age by different presentations including abdominal presentations.The affected children are presented with abdominal pain, which may be caused by surgical causes or by the virus itself that necessitate surgical consultation. This study highlights the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on pediatric patients with acute abdominal pain regarding the presentation, clinical evaluation, and surgical management. A retrospective cohort study was done through the collection of data from medical records and authors' data repositories of pediatric patients presented with acute abdomen from March 2020 to March 2022, in three pediatric surgery tertiary centers. Eighty-four pediatric patients with acute abdominal pain were included in this study. The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was found in 31 patients (36.9%). Generalized abdominal pain was noted in 17 patients (20.2%) and presentation mimicked acute cholecystitis was occured in 14 patients (16.7%). ultrasonography revealed intussusception in 12 cases (14.3%). Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) was present in 9 cases (10.7%) and only one case of pancreatitis (1.2%). Conservative management was successful in 66 cases (78.6%), while operative intervention was needed in18 cases (21.4%). During the COVID-19 pandemic, acute abdominal pain in children was frequently observed. Careful follow up is critically important as most cases do not necessitate surgical intervention. It is crucial to consider COVID-19 as a differential diagnosis in children presenting with acute abdominal pain, particularly in cases of atypical appendicitis and intussusception to prevent unnecessary surgical procedures."

We report the safety and efficacy of sutimlimab in Japanese patients with CAD who completed a global phase 3 clinical trial (CARDINAL/CADENZA: 26-week treatment with 1-2 years of open-label extension [OLE] periods) and subsequently participated in the Japanese OLE study. Patients with a recent history of blood transfusion (CARDINAL, n = 3) and those without (CADENZA, n = 4) were analyzed (71.4% female; median [range] baseline age: 70 [46-83] years). For CARDINAL/CADENZA, the treatment duration (median [range]) was 140.9 (104.9-157.3) weeks, and the cessation period was 70 (61-133) weeks. For the Japanese OLE study, the treatment duration was 47.1 (15.1-49.1) weeks. Three (42.9%) patients experienced treatment-related and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs): injection site erythema, cystitis bacterial, viral infection, and blood pressure increased during CARDINAL/CADENZA. One (14.3%) patient experienced one treatment-related TEAE (urinary tract infection) during the Japanese OLE study. One patient died of renal failure, considered unrelated to sutimlimab, that was exacerbated by hepatorenal syndrome due to liver cirrhosis and bacterial peritonitis, in addition to CKD. Hemoglobin and bilirubin levels improved during treatment but deteriorated after withdrawal and recovered on retreatment. Sutimlimab was well tolerated over a median of 3.8 years, with no new safety concerns identified during retreatment."

    "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that radiologists and other providers perceive the teratogenic risks of radiologic imaging to be higher than they actually are. Thus, pregnant patients were less likely to receive ionizing radiation procedures. While it is imperative to minimize fetal radiation exposure, clinicians must remember that diagnostic studies should not be avoided due to fear of radiation, particularly if the imaging study can significantly impact patient care. Although guidelines do exist regarding how best to image pregnant patients, many providers are unaware of these guidelines and thus lack confidence when making imaging decisions for pregnant patients. This study aimed to gather information about current education, confidence in, and knowledge about emergency imaging of pregnant women among radiology, emergency medicine, and OB/GYN providers. We created and distributed an anonymous survey to radiology, emergency medicine, and OB/GYN providers to evaluate their knowledge and confidence in imaging pregnant patients in the emergent setting. This study included a questionnaire with the intent of knowing the correct answers among physicians primarily across the United States (along with some international participation). We conducted subgroup analyses, comparing variables by specialty, radiology subspecialty, and training levels. Based on the survey results, we subsequently developed educational training videos. 108 radiologists, of which 32 self-identified as emergency radiologists, ten emergency medicine providers and six OB/GYN clinicians completed the survey. The overall correct response rate was 68.5%, though performance across questions was highly variable. Within our 18-question survey, four questions had a correct response rate under 50%, while five questions had correct response rates over 90%. Most responding physicians identified themselves as either \"fairly\" (58/124, 47%) or \"very\" (51/124, 41%) confident. Amongst specialties, there were differences in performance concerning the knowledge assessment (p = 0.049), with the strongest performance from radiologists. There were no differences in knowledge by training level (p = 0.4), though confidence levels differed significantly between attending physicians and trainees (p < 0.001). This study highlights deficiencies in knowledge to support appropriate decision-making surrounding the imaging of pregnant patients. Our results indicate the need for improved physician education and dissemination of standardized clinical guidelines."

    "abstract": "Richter's hernia is a rare but serious surgical emergency involving the entrapment or strangulation of part of the bowel's circumference in the hernial orifice, often without causing complete luminal obstruction. This case report describes a man in his 70s presenting with a 3-day history of abdominal pain and vomiting, despite normal bowel movements. Blood results revealed raised inflammatory markers, and computed tomography imaging suggested small bowel obstruction due to an incarcerated left inguinal hernia. Emergency surgery confirmed a Richter's hernia with a strangulated but viable bowel loop. Early surgical intervention led to a positive outcome. This case underscores the importance of high suspicion, early referral, and timely imaging in managing Richter's hernia to prevent severe complications, such as gangrene and perforation. Despite the absence of obstructive symptoms, early surgical intervention is critical when there is clinical concern regarding strangulation."

This review aims to highlight recent evidence and update current recommendations. Notable evidence has emerged in certain aspects of diverticulitis. This includes disease pathogenesis, as emerging data suggest a potentially greater role for the microbiome and genetic predisposition than previously thought. Acute management has also seen major shifts, where traditional antibiotic treatment may no longer be necessary for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Following successful medical management of acute diverticulitis, indications for elective sigmoidectomy have decreased. The benefit of emergency surgery remains for peritonitis, sepsis, obstruction, and acute diverticulitis in certain immunocompromised patients. Routine colonoscopy, once recommended after all acute diverticulitis episodes, has been shown to be beneficial for cancer exclusion in a distinct patient population. Despite advances in research, certain entities remain poorly understood, such as smoldering diverticulitis and symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease. As research in the field expands, paradigm shifts will shape our understanding of diverticulitis, influencing how clinicians approach management and educate patients."

Such sizeable foreign body (FB) in the aerodigestive tract also poses a constant threat of hollow viscus perforation, and the removal process can be complex. This report describes a fishing mishap causing the impaction of a large live fish in the laryngopharynx and esophagus, leading to respiratory distress and upper esophageal perforation. The paper highlights the mechanism of injury, emergent airway management, anatomical consideration of the location of the FB, and technical challenges in FB removal. After endotracheal intubation, the depth and location of the live fish were confirmed with a plain radiograph. The removal of the live fish was eventually successful after dislodging its fins from the laryngopharynx and rotating its head out from the upper esophagus endoscopically. The upper esophageal perforation healed with non-operative management, and the patient was discharged well."

    "abstract": "While oncological emergencies in colorectal cancer present distinct challenges, existing literature offers conflicting evidence regarding long-term outcomes. Therefore, the present study compared the postoperative prognoses between patients with and without oncological emergencies. A retrospective evaluation was conducted on patients who had undergone radical surgery for pathological stages II and III colorectal cancer at a single center between January 2012 and December 2020. Patients were classified into the non-emergency and oncological emergency groups. The status of oncologic emergency was divided into obstruction and perforation. The outcomes were compared using propensity score matching. The primary objective was to compare the postoperative prognoses between non-emergency and oncological emergency situations. The secondary objectives included comparing prognoses between obstruction and perforation, identifying the type of recurrence depending on the status of oncologic emergency, and assessing the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy for oncologic emergencies. This study included 524 patients. After propensity score matching, the prognoses of oncological emergencies were worse compared with those without any emergency, whereas those of obstruction and perforation did not significantly differ. Regarding the type of recurrence, peritoneal dissemination in obstruction and local recurrence in perforation was more common compared with that in non-emergency cases. Adjuvant chemotherapy improved the recurrence-free survival for cases with oncological emergencies. The prognoses in cases with oncological emergencies could be worse compared with those without any emergency, whereas obstruction and perforation outcomes can be comparable. The administration of adjuvant chemotherapy should be strongly considered for oncological emergencies."

    "abstract": "The Medtronic Micra VR and Abbott AVEIR VR are the leadless pacemakers (LPM) currently available in the United States (US). Micra VR employs fixation tines and the AVEIR VR uses an active fixation helix. Micra VR requires fixation before electrical measurements are obtained, while R-waves may be mapped by AVEIR VR without fixation. Little comparative data is available for these LPMs. Accordingly, we compared the incidences of procedure-related major adverse clinical events (MACE) and device problems in the US for Micra VR and AVEIR VR during 2022-2024. We searched the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for US reports of MACE and device problems that were filed from April 2022 to December 2023 for AVEIR VR, and from June 2022 to April 2024 for Micra VR. Totals for US-registered LPM implants were obtained from the manufacturers' product performance reports. During the study period, 5990 AVEIR VR and 10 940 Micra VR implants were registered in the US. We found 305 MAUDE reports for AVEIR VR (5.1%), versus 541 MAUDE reports for Micra VR (4.9%) (p = .702). The incidence of MACE was 0.72% (43/5990) for AVEIR VR versus 0.59% (65/10 940) for Micra VR, (p = .387). The incidences of procedure-related death, cardiac perforation. cardiac arrest, emergency pericardial drainage or reparative surgery were similar for both LPMs (p > .05). Micra VR had more unacceptable thresholds requiring LPM replacement compared to AVEIR VR (95;0.9% vs. 24;0.4%; p = .001). AVEIR VR had a statistically higher incidence of device dislodgement during (32) and after (21) implant compared to Micra VR (53 (0.9%) vs. 46 (0.4%), p < .001). Micra VR and AVEIR VR have similar procedural safety profiles, including the incidences of death and perforation. However, device problems differed significantly, possibly related to their design differences. Compared to Micra VR, AVEIR VR appears to have an advantageous threshold measurement capability but is more prone to device dislodgement."

It is prevalent in Western countries, with up to 60% of people aged 60 having diverticula. In Asian countries, the prevalence is lower, ranging from 13 to 25%. Diverticulitis can occur in any location of the diverticula, with increasing incidence with age. Complications occur in 12% of patients with diverticulitis, with phlegmon or abscesses being the most common. Perforation is a life-threatening complication with a 1-year mortality rate of 20%. Recent studies suggest that chronic inflammation and alteration of the gut microbiome may play a role in diverticulitis, leading to a less aggressive and conservative approach to treatment. Even though diverticular disease represents a very common clinical entity, diverticula located in the transverse colon it is an extremely rare presentation. We present the case of a 39-year-old female with a history of multiple medical conditions who presented to the Emergency Room (ER) with severe diffuse abdominal pain predominantly in the right lower quadrant associated with shortness of breath. Upon physical examination, she was found to have severe pain, bilateral rhonchi, and a diffusely tender abdomen with guarding without rebound tenderness.

Methods A retrospective review of case notes to evaluate postoperative outcomes was conducted. All emergency small bowel obstructions treated laparoscopically were included. The cases that were converted to a laparotomy were excluded. Demographics (age, sex), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, indication for surgery, duration of stay, complications, requirement of stoma, requirement of intensive treatment unit/high dependency unit (ITU/HDU), reoperation/readmissions, and 30-day mortality were noted. The results were tabulated and analyzed accordingly. Results There were 119 patients studied, with a median age of 66 (range: 17-97). The sex ratio was 62 females to 57 males. Primary etiologies of adhesion bands (49.5%, 59) and hernia (31.9%, 38) were the most common. Minor and major complications were 15 (12.6%) and 37 (31%), respectively. Three (2.5%) patients passed away within 30 days of surgery. The median length of stay (LOS) was eight days. The median LOS subgroup analysis showed nine days for adhesiolysis and six days for hernias. Discussion This study shows that there is significant heterogeneity in outcomes regarding small bowel obstruction around the world. We have demonstrated similar to better results in our center relative to other prominent centers in the UK. This can be attributed to the patient cohort, presentation, and physiological status on admission, delay to surgery, and associated co-morbidities to name a few. Conclusion This study indicates that laparoscopic surgery is a safe approach to treating ASBO, provided adequate expertise and infrastructure are available."

Emergency surgery was performed owing to the diagnosis of small bowel volvulus with intestinal malrotation, which necessitated massive small bowel resection. The remnant small intestine was approximately 100cm in length. The patient developed short bowel syndrome postoperatively but eventually resumed a normal diet."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is the most prevalent surgical emergency. The negative appendicectomy rate and diagnostic uncertainty are important concerns. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of current appendicitis risk prediction models in patients with acute right iliac fossa pain. A nationwide prospective observational study was conducted, including all consecutive adult patients who presented with right iliac fossa pain. Diagnostic, clinical and negative appendicectomy rate data were recorded. The Alvarado score, Appendicitis Inflammatory Response (AIR), Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha Appendicitis (RIPASA) and Adult Appendicitis Score systems were calculated with collected data to classify patients into risk categories. Diagnostic value and categorization performance were evaluated, with use of risk category-based metrics including 'true positive rate' (percentage of appendicitis patients in the highest risk category), 'failure rate' (percentage of patients with appendicitis in the lowest risk category) and 'categorization resolution' (true positive rate/failure rate). A total of 3358 patients from 84 centres were included. Female patients were less likely to undergo surgery than men (71.5% versus 82.5% respectively; relative risk 0.866, 95% c.i. 0.834 to 0.901, P < 0.001); with a three-fold higher negative appendicectomy rate (11.3% versus 4.1% respectively; relative risk 2.744, 95% c.i. 2.047 to 3.677, P < 0.001). Ultrasonography was utilized in 56.8% and computed tomography in 75.2% of all patients. The Adult Appendicitis Score had the best diagnostic performance for the whole population; however, only RIPASA was significant in men. All scoring systems were successful in females patients, but Adult Appendicitis Score had the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value. The RIPASA and the Adult Appendicitis Score had the best categorization resolution values, complemented by their exceedingly low failure rates in both male and female patients. Alvarado and AIR had extremely high failure rates in men. The negative appendicectomy rate was low overall, but women had an almost three-fold higher negative appendicectomy rate despite lower likelihood to undergo surgery. The overuse of imaging tests, best exemplified by the 75.2% frequency of patients undergoing computed tomography, may lead to increased costs. Risk-scoring systems such as RIPASA and Adult Appendicitis Score appear to be superior to Alvarado and AIR."

    "title": "Comparative study of imaging features in uncomplicated and complicated acute appendicitis.",
    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common cause of acute abdominal pain necessitating surgical intervention. While the traditional treatment has been urgent appendectomy, recent studies suggest that an antibiotics-first approach can be safe for uncomplicated cases. Classifying appendicitis into uncomplicated and complicated categories is crucial for guiding treatment decisions and predicting patient outcomes. This study aims to evaluate the distinct imaging findings associated with uncomplicated appendicitis and its complicated subtypes-phlegmonous, gangrenous, and perforated appendicitis-to aid in differential diagnosis. This retrospective observational study was conducted from January 2014 to December 2023 and included 1,250 patients (492 women, 758 men) who underwent an appendectomy with available pathology results. After excluding 56 patients with normal pathology, 52 with non-appendicitis pathologies, and 48 with inaccessible computed tomography (CT) images, 1,094 patients were analyzed. CT images were evaluated for appendiceal diameter, wall thickness, cecal wall thickness, periappendiceal fat stranding, effusion, lymphadenopathy, intraluminal and free periappendiceal air, mucosal hyperenhancement, and the presence of appendicolith. The diameter of the appendix, along with the presence of periappendiceal air, effusion, and intraluminal appendicolith, were significantly higher in the perforated appendicitis group compared to other groups (p<0.05). Periappendiceal fat stranding, evaluated as a binary variable, did not show significant differences among the groups. Appendiceal wall thickness was higher in the perforated group and lower in the non-perforated gangrenous group compared to the uncomplicated group (p<0.05). No significant correlation was found for mucosal hyperenhancement between the appendicitis subgroups. Intraluminal air, though normal in a healthy appendix, was a specific predictor of complicated appendicitis when combined with other findings. This study provides a detailed analysis of distinct imaging findings associated with uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis. Key differentiators such as appendiceal diameter, periappendiceal air, effusion, and intraluminal appendicolith are crucial for accurate diagnosis. The findings highlight the importance of these parameters in distinguishing various types of appendicitis, offering valuable insights for clinical practice. Future prospective studies and advanced imaging techniques are needed to validate these findings and enhance the diagnosis and management of acute appendicitis and its complications."

    "abstract": "Mesenteric injury occurs rarely in cases associated with blunt abdominal trauma. Despite its low incidence, mesenteric injury can lead to fatal outcomes such as hypovolemic shock due to hemoperitoneum or sepsis due to intestinal ischemia, or perforation-related peritonitis. For mesenteric injuries, especially those involving massive bleeding, intestinal ischemia, and perforation, the standard treatment is surgery. However, in the case of operative management, it should be borne in mind that there is a possibility of complications and mortality during and after surgery. The usefulness of transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) is well known in solid organs but is controversial for mesenteric injury. We present a 75-year-old man with mesenteric injury due to blunt abdominal trauma. Initial abdominal computed tomography showed no hemoperitoneum, but a mesenteric contusion and pseudoaneurysm with a diameter of 17 mm were observed near the origin of the superior mesenteric artery. Since there were no findings requiring emergency surgery such as free air or intestinal ischemia, it was decided to perform nonoperative management with TAE using microcoils in hybrid emergency room system. TAE was performed successfully, and there were no complications such as bleeding, bowel ischemia, or delayed bowel perforation. He was discharged on the 23rd day after admission with percutaneous catheter drainage for drainage of mesenteric hematoma. The authors believe that treatment with TAE for highly selected elderly patients with mesenteric injuries has the positive aspect of minimally invasive management, considering the burden of general anesthesia and the various avoidable intraoperative and postoperative complications."

    "abstract": "Jejunal diverticulosis is a rare form of diverticulosis characterized by acquired pseudodiverticula in the small bowel. Although most cases are asymptomatic, the condition can present diagnostic challenges due to its atypical presentation. Complications such as perforation can lead to acute abdomen, significantly increasing morbidity and mortality. We report a rare case of perforated jejunal diverticulitis in an 84-year-old female with a known history of diverticular disease. The patient presented to the emergency department with worsening left lower quadrant abdominal pain. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a focus of air adjacent to the mesentery, indicative of bowel perforation. An urgent exploratory laparotomy was performed, which identified a 4-cm perforated jejunal diverticulum. The affected segment of the small bowel was resected, followed by primary side-to-side jejunal anastomosis. The patient was discharged home in stable condition following uneventful postoperative recovery. This case highlights the importance of including jejunal diverticulosis in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen, particularly in elderly patients with a history of diverticular disease. Due to the nonspecific presentation, prompt imaging is crucial for diagnosis. Surgical intervention is often necessary in cases of perforation. Increased clinical awareness of this rare condition may help reduce diagnostic delays and improve patient outcomes."

In the event of migration, it may result in perforation, as shown in our unique case of pericardial perforation through the fundus. Beyond illustrating a rare condition, this case prompts us to engage in a debate about whether to retain or remove asymptomatic foreign bodies in the gastrointestinal tract. It is a 28-year-old male patient, a prisoner, with a history of recurrent foreign body ingestion leading to five previous interventions, presented a year ago to our emergency department after ingesting four metal rods. Despite recommendations, the patient refused the intervention. After 1 year, he presented to our emergency department for respiratory distress. On examination, he had tachycardia, cardiac auscultation revealed a high-pitched sound signing a pericardial knock and abdominal palpation revealed epigastric tenderness. An abdominal X-ray revealed the presence of metallic foreign bodies located in the gastric area. An electrocardiogram showed a low voltage. Given these findings, there was a strong suspicion of rod migration from the stomach to the thoracic cavity with a cardiac tamponade. An emergency CT scan revealed that the rod had pierced through the stomach and pericardium, causing pericardial effusion. The patient was promptly transported to the operating room to discover the tip of the rod out of the stomach and penetrating the left diaphragm and the pericardial layer. The foreign body was removed."

    "abstract": "Collision tumors of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are thought to be uncommon, with those of the colon being rare with very few cases reported in current literature. There are three proposed theories regarding the etiology of collision tumors currently, including the \"double primaries\", the \"biclonal malignant transformation\", and the \"tumor-to-tumor carcinogenesis\" theories. Prognosis of collision tumors remains unclear. To our knowledge, this is the fifth case of a collision carcinoma involving the cecum and ileocecal valve and the first report of a collision carcinoma including both mucinous adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine tumor of the cecum and the ileocecal valve. The aim of this paper is to explore the history of collision tumors and associated nomenclature, defined diagnostic criteria, and proposed theories for etiology in addition to patient presentation, approach to diagnosis, treatment options, and prognosis. We present the case of an 83-year-old female who presented to the emergency room with a 4-month history of cramping abdominal pain associated with nausea, emesis, and decreased appetite with associated weight loss. Diagnostic imaging demonstrated a bowel obstruction secondary to a mass in the cecum and she underwent an exploratory laparotomy with right hemicolectomy. She was found to have a collision carcinoma of the cecum and ileocecal valve containing both mucinous adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine tumor. Diagnosis was confirmed post-operatively with pathologic examination and immunohistochemical testing. Diagnosing collision tumors upon patient presentation is exceedingly difficult as the symptoms are often identical to other neoplasms of the GI tract and vary based on location of the tumor. It is thought that the true prevalence of collision tumors is underestimated due to history of changing nomenclature, unclear diagnostic criteria, unreported cases, and unrecognized cases. Furthermore, new advances in immunohistochemical evaluation have allowed for better characterization of these neoplasms. With clarification regarding nomenclature, diagnostic criteria and expanding awareness, it is our hope that this leads to an increase in reported cases, allowing for an expanded discussion and resulting growth of literature and further studies. Further knowledge regarding the pathogenesis, treatment, and prognosis is needed."

Spontaneous splenic rupture is usually associated with hematologic, neoplastic, or infectious disorders, with infectious mononucleosis associated with Epstein-Barr virus being the most common cause worldwide. Spontaneous splenic rupture without underlying cause is thought to be exceedingly rare. In this article we present a case involving a true spontaneous splenic rupture. We present the case of a 73-year-old female with past medical history significant for hypothyroidism, hypertension, squamous cell carcinoma of the chest, and history of tobacco use who presented to the emergency department with acute onset of left-sided flank pain radiating to her shoulder beginning three days prior. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast revealed an acute splenic injury concerning for rupture with contour obscured by blood products with associated mild to moderate hemoperitoneum. The decision was made to proceed with emergent exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy. Patient received her post splenectomy vaccinations. On follow-up appointment, patient was noted to be doing well. This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of atraumatic splenic rupture, as delayed diagnosis and treatment is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Operative intervention including splenectomy remains the mainstay of treatment, in addition to appropriate resuscitation. Some authors have reported cases in which hemodynamically stable patients are able to be treated non-operatively, however, the long-term consequences are unknown. Atraumatic spontaneous splenic rupture is often low on the differential diagnoses due to its rarity. Unfortunately, it carries a high risk of morbidity and mortality, and thus timely diagnosis and intervention is imperative."

This multicenter retrospective study involved three of the largest academic medical centers in central Ethiopia. All patients who sustained an anterior abdominal stab injury and underwent exploratory laparotomy, regardless of the intraoperative findings, were included over the 3-year course of the study. Of the 117 patients who underwent exploratory laparotomy, 35 patients (29.9%) underwent nontherapeutic laparotomies. Three factors predicted therapeutic laparotomy: hollow viscus evisceration (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 5.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-28.64; P=0.032), localized and generalized peritonitis (AOR, 4.77; 95% CI, 1.90-11.93; P=0.001), and white blood cell count ≥11,500/mm3 (AOR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.002-7.650; P=0.049). The overall positive predictive value of the therapeutic predictors was 80.2%, while the negative predictive value of all predictor-negative patients was 58.1%. The predictors would have prevented 51.4% of the nontherapeutic laparotomies. Close to one-third of the patients had a nontherapeutic laparotomy. The clinical predictors of therapeutic laparotomy were shown to have a high positive predictive value despite a lower negative predictive value. Further prospective studies that involve all patients who sustain anterior abdominal stab injuries are needed to potentially improve on the negative predictive value of the predictors suggested by our study."

Managing gastroschisis in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants presents significant challenges because of their immature physiologies and increased risk of complications. This report discusses the case of a female ELBW infant born via an emergency cesarean section at 29 weeks of gestation, weighing 768 g, who had a prenatal diagnosis of gastroschisis. Postnatal management included immediate surgical intervention using a hand-made silo manufactured from expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) sheets that were sutured to the patient's abdominal wall to accommodate her small abdominal cavity and preserve mesenteric blood flow. Necrotizing enterocolitis with bowel perforation emerged as a complication, which led to the excision of a 10 cm segment of the ileum and the creation of an ileostomy. The infant experienced insufficient weight gain and liver dysfunction. However, she was eventually discharged on day 142 of life, weighing 2774 g, on oral feeding, without significant complications. This case emphasizes how prematurity significantly affected the patient's clinical outcomes, and highlights the importance of individualized management strategies. Our experience demonstrates that custom silo placement allows for the size to be adapted to the abdominal defect, and highlights the critical need to prioritize postnatal bowel perfusion in ELBW infants with gastroschisis."

Non-Meckel's small-bowel diverticular perforation is rare, and the rate of mortality is high. However, there is currently no consensus regarding its therapeutic management. Case 1: A 73-year-old Japanese man with localized lower abdominal pain was referred to our hospital. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed diverticulitis of the small intestine, which was managed conservatively. Four days after admission, abdominal pain worsened, and repeat CT revealed extraintestinal gas. Emergency surgery was performed for the segmental resection of the perforated jejunum with anastomosis. Case 2: A 73-year-old Japanese woman was transferred to our hospital with small-bowel perforation. CT revealed scattered diverticula in the small intestine and extraintestinal gas around the small-intestinal diverticula. Emergency surgery was performed for the segmental resection of the perforated jejunum with anastomosis. Conservative treatment for small-bowel diverticular perforation may be attempted in mild cases; however, surgical intervention should not be delayed. Segmental resection of the affected intestinal tract with an anastomosis is the standard treatment. Residual diverticula should be documented because of the possibility of diverticulosis recurrence."

Early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention are extremely important. This study presented an extremely rare case of a hepatic hydatid cyst ruptured into the thorax, which may have high morbidity and mortality. A 24-year-old male patient presented to our emergency department with cough, dyspnea, fever, and allergy symptoms. He had a history of hepatic hydatid cyst surgery 5 years ago. Physical examination revealed urticarial lesions on the skin. The body temperature was 39 °C, and the pulse rate was 120 beats/min. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein. Contrast-enhanced thoracic and abdominal computed tomography was performed. Diagnostic tests revealed that the patient had a ruptured hepatic hydatid cyst in the right thoracic cavity; hence, he was scheduled for emergency surgery. Laparotomy was performed via a right subcostal incision, and the ruptured cyst was located. It was understood that this cyst had fistulized into the diaphragm during a chronic process and subsequently ruptured acutely into the thorax. Partial cystectomy was performed for a ruptured liver cyst. The diaphragm was repaired, and catheters were placed in the thorax and abdomen for drainage. There were no other postoperative complications. Rupture of hydatid cyst disease is frequently observed in endemic regions. The rupture of a hepatic hydatid cyst into the thorax is an extremely rare event. In patients presenting with pulmonary symptoms who have a history of hepatic hydatid cyst surgery, the abdomen should always be thoroughly evaluated, and emergency surgery should be performed if required."

Esophageal perforation is a rare but very serious post-ACDF complication, and cases in which screws extrude through the mouth are even rarer. Herein, we present the case of a 61-year-old woman who visited our emergency center with oral extrusion of a screw 6 months after undergoing ACDF. Although diagnostic imaging did not confirm esophageal perforation, the oral extrusion of the screw was clear evidence of the complication. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of oral screw extrusion without confirmed esophageal injury. This case suggests that screw migration and esophageal perforation can occur depending on the patient's underlying condition, and if the symptoms are mild, conservative treatment alone may be sufficient to treat the perforation."

It is exceedingly uncommon for the two to occur simultaneously. We present the case of a 41-year-old male presented with a one-day history of sudden onset of right iliac fossa (RIF) pain associated with a two-day history of nausea and fevers. The only notable lab finding was elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Clinical examination revealed right abdominal and renal angle tenderness, with RIF rebound and guarding. Computed tomography (CT) concluded acute uncomplicated appendicitis with a subhepatic appendix and he was planned for an emergent laparoscopic appendicectomy. Exposure of the retrocaecal appendix with the caecum in the right loin posed a challenging laparoscopy. The appendix was found to be adherent to the duodenum, right kidney, and transverse colon, and the decision was made to convert to laparotomy to establish safe mobilisation from the duodenum. The appendix was resected in two parts and the histopathology revealed an appendiceal diverticulum with subserosal abscess formation. The subhepatic position of the cecum and appendix is a result of foetal gut malrotation. There is no standard approach for the best course of treatment. The laparotomy conversion gave us better tactile input and direct access to the appendix. Our goal is to educate readers on how to manage an unusual presentation of AA."

This case report highlights the clinical course of a 75-year-old female who developed a transverse mesocolic internal hernia, a subtype of transmesenteric hernia (TH), following a Hartmann reversal procedure. The patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with a sudden onset of severe, diffuse abdominal pain. Her medical history was significant for systemic lupus erythematosus, pulmonary fibrosis, multiple pulmonary embolisms, and a recent Hartmann reversal procedure the month prior. Initial imaging suggested postoperative ileus, but the patient's symptoms persisted despite conservative management. Subsequent imaging raised suspicion of an internal hernia, and on hospital day 6, an urgent diagnostic laparoscopy revealed a herniated segment of the small bowel through a defect in the transverse mesocolon with herniation into the lesser sac. The herniated bowel was successfully reduced, and the defect was repaired. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged in stable condition. Transmesenteric hernias, though more common in the pediatric population, can occur in adults, particularly following abdominal surgery. Diagnosis can be challenging due to variable symptoms and imaging findings. However, prompt recognition and surgical intervention are crucial to prevent complications such as bowel ischemia and strangulation. This case underscores the importance of considering internal hernias in the differential diagnosis of small bowel obstruction (SBO), especially in patients with a history of recent abdominal surgery. Early diagnosis and timely surgical management are essential for a favorable outcome."

It often has an insidious onset with non-specific symptoms. Today we report a rare case of a 30-year-old woman who recently traveled to Vietnam and presented with worsening upper and lower gastrointestinal symptoms. CT scan revealed an ill-defined mass in the terminal ileum with prominent mucosal enhancement and wall thickening, which ultimately led to subsequent colonoscopy and Quantiferon Gold testing, revealing a positive result. Biopsy of the mass demonstrated noncaseating granulomatous colitis with rare acid-fast positive bacillus consistent with mycobacterial infection. As a result, the patient was ultimately initiated on antituberculosis therapy. Shortly thereafter, she was readmitted with clinical features suggestive of a bowel obstruction. The patient was managed with supportive care and did not require surgical intervention.

    "abstract": "We report an interesting case of a 17 cm colo-colonic intussusception involving the transverse colon, caecum, and distal small bowel in a previously healthy 79-year-old man. The patient presented to the emergency department with a two-day history of mild, left to right iliac fossa abdominal pain, with no other concerning symptoms. He had a CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast for suspected subacute bowel obstruction secondary to recurrent bowel cancer. This was reported as colo-colonic intussusception. Following a surgical review, he was transferred from the local district general hospital for an exploratory laparotomy and underwent a right hemicolectomy with primary ileocolonic anastomosis the same evening. The patient was discharged seven days later following an unremarkable post-operative recovery. Final histology confirmed a mucinous adenocarcinoma of the caecum with postoperative cancer staging as T2N0M0. Following discussion at the colorectal multidisciplinary meeting, no adjuvant therapy was advised, and he was placed on the standard colorectal cancer surveillance program for the next five years."

    "abstract": "We report a case of postoperative perforation in the bronchus intermedius membrane after pulmonary resection for lung cancer. An 83-year-old man with lung cancer underwent thoracoscopic right lower lobectomy+ND2a-1 dissection. On postoperative day 11, subcutaneous emphysema appeared to him, and chest radiograph showed niveau formation and pleural effusion on the operative side. Chest computed tomography( CT) suggested a bronchial membrane defect of the bronchus intermedius. We confirmed a bronchial perforation in the bronchus intermedius membrane by bronchoscopy and performed urgent operation. The defect of the perforated membrane was too large to be sutured directly, so a middle lobectomy was performed. After this operation, the patient had a small bronchial stump fistula which was successfully treated with endoscopic bronchial occlusion. Although the patient required treatment for heart failure, he recovered and was discharged 44 days after the reoperation. This perforation could be caused not only by bronchial ischemia due to subcarinal lymph node dissection, but also by injury to the adventitia of the bronchus intermedius membrane due to rough handling and unrecognized burning of the injured area with an electric scalpel. Thermal damage caused by energy devices needs to be noted."

    "abstract": "Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) is a reliable index derived from serum albumin levels, height, and weight. Although various prognostic factors have been studied, the effect of preoperative nutritional status on surgical outcomes remains unexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the GNRI in predicting postoperative outcomes of lower gastrointestinal perforation. Eighty patients treated at our institution between January 2016 and December 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. This study primarily focused on the correlation between preoperative GNRI and two key outcomes: postoperative hospital stay duration and 1-year mortality rate. Our findings revealed a significant association between low GNRI scores and increased 1-year mortality (odd ratio 4.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-16, p = 0.025). Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test showed that patients in the low GNRI group had markedly poorer overall survival rates than those in the high GNRI group (12-month survival rate 0.88 [95% CI: 0.75-0.95] vs. 0.65 [95% CI: 0.47-0.78]; p = 0.018). Additionally, both univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that lower GNRI scores were associated with prolonged hospital stays. We showed that a low GNRI score was associated with high mortality and prolonged hospital stay after emergency surgery for lower gastrointestinal perforation."

In contrast, there is limited knowledge on those patients that require emergency laparotomy but do not undergo surgery (NoLaps). A multicentre cohort study (n=64 UK surgical centres) recruited 750 consecutive NoLap patients (February 15th - November 15th 2021, inclusive of a 90-day follow up period). Each patient was admitted to hospital with a surgical condition treatable by an emergency laparotomy (defined by The National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA) criteria), but a decision was made not to undergo surgery (NoLap). NoLap patients were predominately female (452 patients, 60%), of advanced age (median age 83.0 yr, interquartile range 77.0-88.8), frail (523 patients, 70%), and had severe comorbidity (750 patients, 100%); 99% underwent CT scanning. The commonest diagnoses were perforation (26%), small bowel obstruction (17%), and ischaemic bowel (13%). The 90-day mortality was 79% and influencing factors were >80 yr, underweight BMI, elevated serum lactate or creatinine concentration. The majority of patients died in hospital (77%), with those with ischaemic bowel dying early. For the 21% of NoLap patients that survived to 90 days, 77% returned home with increased care requirements. This study reports that the NoLap patient population present significant medical challenges because of their extreme levels of comorbidity, frailty, and physiology. Despite these complexities a fifth remained alive at 90 days. Further work is underway to explore this high-risk decision-making process. ISRCTN14556210."

    "abstract": "Traumatic intestinal perforation by foreign bodies is rare, with cases involving live fish being exceedingly uncommon, with only one reported case to date. We present a unique case of a 55-year-old fisherman who presented to the Emergency Department with traumatic intestinal perforation due to an eel fish accidentally entering his rectum. Despite initial reluctance to seek medical attention, prompt intervention was crucial to addressing peritonitis. The patient presented with severe abdominal pain and signs of peritonitis. X-ray findings confirmed pneumoperitoneum. Urgent laparotomy revealed a live eel fish and a 5 cm sigmoid colon perforation, necessitating a sigmoid colostomy. Early recognition of traumatic intestinal perforation is vital for prompt management. Diagnosis can be challenging, emphasizing the need for thorough history-taking and imaging. Surgical intervention aims to repair the intestinal perforation, prevent complications and promote healing. This case highlights the importance of considering unusual causes of abdominal pain, particularly in relevant occupational history. Prompt surgical intervention is crucial for favorable clinical outcomes."

    "abstract": "In situ fenestration of aortic endografts is an alternative endovascular technique for treatment of complex aortic aneurysms. While this technique has been carried out also to pass stent-grafts in individual cases, its feasibility and safety using different stent-grafts needs to be evaluated. In a saline bath at water temperature of 37°C, a 0.018\" Astato 30 guidewire was advanced through 3 different stent-grafts (RelayPro, Zenith and Endurant II) by applying external current of 180 W via an electrosurgery pencil. Puncture efficacy and quality of the fenestration after ballooning with a 6 mm percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) catheter were assessed. Then, balloon-expandable covered stents were deployed in the fenestrations and evaluated for stenosis, using microscopy and radiography. Crossing of the electrified guidewire was instantaneous in the Zenith (n:10) and RelayPro (n:10) groups but not in 3 of 10 punctures in the Endurant group (p<.05). The fenestration area created after PTA was significantly larger in the RelayPro (5.3 mm2 ± 1.8, interquartile range [IQR] 1.6) and Zenith group (6.7 mm2 ± 0.7, IQR 0.5) compared to Endurant (2.3 mm2 ± 0.4, IQR 0.5, p<.001). Fraying was observed in all groups while graft shredding was found in 8 cases after PTA of the Zenith and Endurant endografts and in 5 of the RelayPro group, but the difference was not significant. Vertical tearing was detected after RelayPro (2 out of 10) and Zenith (6 out of 10) fenestrations, no damage was found in the Endurant group (p<.01). Residual stenosis at the level of the fenestration after implantation of a 6 × 79 mm VBX stent had to be corrected in all Endurant cases with a high-pressure PTA catheter. No stenosis was found in the RelayPro and Zenith groups before and after flaring. The \"electrified wire\" technique is a feasible tool that can be used to perform in situ fenestration by perforation of the endograft fabric. Based on this experimental evaluation the \"ideal graft\" for this technique could not be identified. Long-term fatigue tests and comparison with other fenestration techniques are required. In situ endograft fenestration can be a useful technique in emergent aortic repair. Recently, the electrified wire technique has been proposed as alternative option to laser, radiofrequency and needle-based techniques. In comparison to these methods, the use of electrified wires can be performed without modifications of routine equipment. Additionally, the material costs can be substantially reduced. However, the effectiveness of this approach for fenestration of different prosthetic grafts is unknown. Based on our experimental studies, the electrified wire technique is feasible but the Endurant endograft requires more attempts, and the placement of a bridging stent should be completed with high-pressure balloons."

    "abstract": "An 82-year-old man presented to our emergency department with a bulge in the right groin and worsening pain that had been present for one week. An abdominal computed tomography scan revealed fluid collection within a right inguinal hernia and a thickened appendix within the hernia sac. The patient underwent an emergency laparoscopic appendectomy under a diagnosis of Amyand's hernia with peri-appendicular abscess. During surgery, the incarcerated appendix was pulled back into the abdominal cavity from the hernia sac, and the perforated appendix was resected. For drainage of the abscess, a drain tube was laparoscopically placed into the hernia sac through the internal inguinal ring. Considering the risk of mesh infection and wound infection, the patient underwent appendectomy alone but not hernia repair at this time. Two months later, Lichtenstein repair using mesh was performed as a second-stage procedure. For Amyand's hernia with abscess, this type of two-stage strategy may avoid the surgical site infection, and the use of mesh in a second procedure would minimize the possibility of hernia recurrence, unlike previously reported cases treated by concomitant appendectomy and hernia repair."

    "abstract": "Reported incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) is around 5.0-7.5% of all hospitalized patients, and 40% of them are postoperative patients. Major abdominal surgeries account for 3.1-35% of cases of postoperative AKI in various series. The aim of the study was to identify the incidence and risk factors of AKI in peritonitis patients undergoing emergency laparotomy. Adult patients aged 18-65 years undergoing emergency laparotomy for perforation peritonitis were included in this prospective observational study. Baseline clinical and laboratory data, intraoperative details and postoperative outcome data (AKI at day 7, length of intensive care unit and hospital stay, and mortality) were recorded. Logistic regression model was constructed to predict AKI at day 7. N = 140 patients were included in this study and 69 patients (49.3%) developed AKI within day 7. Larger volume of crystalloid [OR (95% CI) 1.00 (1.00-1.00); p = 0.012], intraoperative vasopressor use (OR 7.42 (2.41-22.83); p < 0.001), intraoperative blood loss [OR 1.004(1.00-1.01); p = 0.003] and the presence of chronic liver disease (CLD) [OR 22.44 (1.68-299.26); p = 0.019] were risk factors for the development of AKI. Acute kidney injury patients had increased mortality at day 90 (24.6% vs 1.4%; p < 0.001), length of ICU stay (3 days vs 0 days, p < 0.001), and length of hospital stay (11 days vs 7 days; p < 0.001). In peritonitis patients undergoing emergency laparotomy, as many as 49% of patients develop AKI within 1 week. The presence of CLD, intraoperative blood loss, and the use of crystalloids and vasopressor increase the odds of developing AKI. Priya P, Baidya DK, Anand RK, Ray BR, Khanna P, Krishna A, et al.

Socio-economic circumstances and regional differences have an influence on the utilization of care and outcomes in many diagnostic groups, but there are only a few studies focusing on their effect in EL population. The aim of this study was to examine the socio-economic and regional differences in the rate of EL within one tertiary care hospital district. Retrospective single-center study of 573 patients who underwent EL in Oulu University Hospital between May 2015 and December 2017. The postal code area of each patient's home address was used to determine the socio-economic status and rurality of the location of residence. The age-adjusted rate of EL was higher in patients from low-income areas compared to patients from high-income areas [1.46 ((95% CI 1.27-1.64)) vs. 1.15 (95% CI, 0.96-1.34)]. The rate of EL was higher in rural areas compared to urban areas [1.29 (95% CI 1.17-1.41 vs. 1.42 (1.18-1.67)]. Peritonitis was more common in patients living in low-income areas. There were no differences in operation types or mortality between the groups. The study findings suggest that there are socio-economic and regional differences in the need of EL. The patients living in low-income areas had a higher rate of EL and a higher rate of peritonitis. These differences cannot be explained by patient demographics or comorbidities alone."

    "abstract": "Internal hernia is responsible for 0.6-5.8% of all small intestinal obstructions. Only 8% of internal hernias are of the congenital trans mesenteric variant. Urgent surgical intervention should be considered in individuals who exhibit intestinal obstruction before the development of irreversible bowel ischemia and necrosis. The authors report a 38-year-old male patient who presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain, distension, and vomiting for the last three days. After an explorative laparotomy, it was confirmed that there was a trans mesenteric hernia defect with strangulated distal ileal loops. End-to-end ileo-ileal anastomosis was done. Early recognition and subsequent surgical treatment permit proper management and prevent complications. There should be a differential diagnosis. In this case, there is no prior history of abdominal surgery, and the patient presents with recurrent abdominal pain and intestinal obstruction. Early diagnosis and emergency laparotomy can save the intestine before gangrene, lowering morbidity and mortality, correcting the mesenteric defect to prevent recurrences, and enhancing clinical outcomes because many studies have shown that some cases are missed before radiological investigation. Laparotomy is still the method of choice for acute cases of incarceration with bowel obstruction, strangulation, and ischemia. The entire mesentery needs to be evaluated, and all mesenteric defects need to be sutured to prevent recurrence."

    "abstract": "Ogilvie syndrome is a rare condition characterized by acute colonic dilation. In 1948, H. Ogilvie first described it in medical literature. Its incidence is estimated at 100 cases per 100 000 per year in the US. Both abdominal distention and pain are considered major symptoms. A 32-year-old woman, 36+1 weeks pregnant, experienced labour pain and was admitted to the hospital. Upon examination, she was in labour, but the foetus was in a breech position, necessitating a caesarean section. After 36 h later, she returned to the emergency department with severe, 1-day-old diffuse abdominal pain, accompanied by moderate bilious vomiting and significant abdominal distension. Abdominal CT with contrast revealed pneumoperitoneum, abdominal wall emphysema, and pneumatosis intestinalis involving the caecum and ascending colon, suggesting bowel necrosis. Emergency laparotomy revealed a caecal perforation, which was closed surgically without resection. Ogilvie syndrome is more common in males but can occur in females for several reasons, including pregnancy, caesarean section, pelvic surgeries, and trauma. Several factors contribute to the occurrence of this syndrome, such as pelvic fractures and cardiac events. Surgery may be required if there is suspicion of bowel perforation or ischaemia. OS is a rare condition in women, often seen after childbirth or pelvic surgery, with an unclear cause but believed to be related to autonomic nervous system imbalance. Patients with abdominal pain and distension, without evidence of obstruction, should be evaluated for pseudo-obstruction using abdominal pelvic CT, and treatment may involve conservative measures, medication, and colonoscopic decompression."

We present a 30-year-old female patient with a history of an appendectomy. She attends the emergency room due to a four-day history of pain in the lower abdominal quadrants, tachycardia, and leukocytosis, with an abdominal CT scan identifying an inflammatory process of the ileum, suggesting a Meckel's diverticulum, urachus remnant, or foreign body. The patient was taken to surgery, and inflammatory adhesions, including a perforated Meckel's diverticulum with necrotic signs and purulent production, were evidenced. Intestinal resection and ileal anastomosis were performed with no complications at 90 days. Preoperative diagnosis is difficult in cases with associated inflammatory conditions and is generally made incidentally during surgery and less frequently with CT scans. Surgical management for patients with MD is still controversial and depends on many factors, including symptoms, related complications, characteristics of the diverticulum, and the patient's clinical condition. Currently, no standardized surgical technique exists, and cases should be individualized. Meckel's diverticulum perforation is a rare complication in the adult population and remains a diagnostic and surgical challenge, and the final decision must be individualized."

We discuss the higher reported incidence of XGA in interval appendectomy specimens compared to emergency appendectomies, and how this relates to its proposed pathophysiology. We found that XGA is associated with a more challenging operative field and the need to convert from a laparoscopic to an open procedure, increasing the potential risks of surgical complications. The potential development of XGA should be considered when planning an interval appendectomy as it may impact operative planning, although there is no clear consensus on its clinical significance."

    "abstract": "Background Diagnosing acute appendicitis remains a problem, especially in teenagers with right lower quadrant pain. Imaging studies aid in accurate diagnosis but have limitations such as cost and availability. The Modified Alvarado Scoring System (MASS) is simple and cost-effective with fewer parameters. The Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha Appendicitis scoring system (RIPASA), designed for Asian populations, includes more parameters. This study compares the effectiveness of RIPASA and Alvarado scores in diagnosing acute appendicitis in a specific clinical setting. Objectives To compare the scoring systems of RIPASA and Alvarado in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis at a tertiary care hospital. Methods Data has been collected from all patients who attended the NRI general hospital emergency department and outpatient wing with acute appendicitis, admitted as inpatients based on clinical history and relevant investigations. Patients satisfying inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected and the basic investigations were done. Summary statistics were done using mean, standard deviation and proportions. Inferential statistics were done by using an independent t-test, kappa statistic, sensitivity and specificity with a 95% confidence interval (CI). All the measurements are done using the statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) software version 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and open epidemiological (OpenEpi) software 3.01. A probability (p) <0.05 is considered as statistically significant. Results A total of 110 patients were analyzed for this study with a majority (39%) of them in the 21-30 age group. In our study, females (53%) outnumbered males (47%). Ultrasound findings in our cohort were acute appendicitis (93%), chronic appendicitis (2%) and normal appendix (5%). However, histopathology reported acute appendicitis (75%), chronic appendicitis (9%) and negative/non-specific (15%). The probability of appendicitis as predicted by Alvarado and RIPASA were 40% and 51% respectively. Definitive diagnosis of appendicitis was made in 16.4% with RIPASA whereas only 5.5% with Alvarado. When comparing the Alvarado and RIPASA scores, the sensitivity or true positive rate was higher for RIPASA (73.63%) than for Alvarado (50.55%). Conclusion There was a significant difference between the mean scores in Alvarado and RIPASA inpatients with scores suggestive of appendicitis and no appendicitis. Diagnostic accuracy was higher in RIPASA scoring compared to ALVARDO scoring. There was a significant statistical difference between the two scoring systems. When it comes to diagnosing in low-resource countries the study recommends a combination of Alvarado and RIPASA scoring systems."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Gas in the portal venous system, or hepatic portal venous gas, is a rare occurrence associated with ischemic colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or any cause of bowel perforation, including from a necrotic tumor. This report presents the case of a 72-year-old man with diabetes who had carcinoma of the ileocecal region, sepsis due to Klebsiella pneumoniae, and hepatic portal venous gas. CASE REPORT A 72-year-old man with ileocecal cancer was admitted to our hospital for preoperative diabetes control. He developed a fever and septic shock, without abdominal symptoms or signs of peritoneal irritation. Klebsiella pneumoniae was detected in blood cultures. Abdominal ultrasonography showed hepatic portal venous gas, and a simple computed tomography scan revealed gas in the vasculature and hepatic portal vein in the lateral segment, which led us to believe that the ileocecal mass was the source of infection, and emergency surgery was performed. The patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 34 with good progress despite dehydration due to high-output syndrome. CONCLUSIONS Sepsis due to necrosis of ileocecal cancer is often difficult to diagnose because it is not accompanied by abdominal symptoms, as in our case. However, abdominal ultrasound is useful because it allows for a broad evaluation. This report has demonstrated and highlighted that the findings of hepatic portal venous gas on imaging should be regarded seriously, requiring urgent investigation to identify the cause and commence treatment in cases of infection or sepsis."

    "abstract": "Lower gastrointestinal perforation (LGP) is a surgical emergency disease that can result in secondary bacterial peritonitis. Microbiological studies on LGP are rare. The present study aimed to ascertain the microbiological profile of LGP in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at our institute after surgery. In addition, we investigated whether initial empirical therapy with vancomycin was associated with in-hospital mortality, duration of ICU stay, and duration of ventilator support. This single-center, retrospective, observational study was conducted at Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital, Japan. The study population included all patients diagnosed with LGP who were admitted to the ICU after emergency surgery between 2017 and 2023. The primary outcome assessed was the microbiological profile of microorganisms isolated from ascites fluid and blood of the participants. The secondary end-points were in-hospital mortality, duration of ICU stay, and duration of ventilator support. We performed univariate and multivariate regression analyses to evaluate the end-points. During the study period, 89 patients were included in the analysis. The most commonly identified pathogen from the ascites cultures was Escherichia coli (65.2%), followed by Enterococcus spp. (51.7%). E. faecium was identified in 16 (18.0%) ascites samples. The microbiological profile of critically ill patients with LGP admitted to the ICU after surgery was similar to that of previous studies on intra-abdominal infection (IAI). Therefore, the initial empirical therapy in the IAI guidelines is more appropriate for LGP. Multivariate regression analysis suggested that the combination of initial empirical therapy with vancomycin was not associated with in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23-3.00, p = 0.955), duration of ICU stay (coefficient=-0.92, 95% CI -3.04-1.21, p = 0.393), or duration of ventilator-support (coefficient=-9.03, 95%CI -49.69-31.63, p = 0.659). The microbiological profile of critically ill patients with LGP admitted to the ICU after surgery was similar to that of previous studies on IAI. However, the frequency of E. faecium in the present study was higher than that in previous studies. Initial empirical therapy with drugs such as meropenem in combination with vancomycin for E. faecium was not associated with in-hospital mortality, duration of ICU stay, and duration of ventilator support, after adjusting for confounding factors."

Instead, treatment is based on a combination of our understanding of managing benign esophageal perforations and a contemporary understanding of the treatment and prognosis of esophageal cancer. Due to the numerous challenges of managing perforated esophageal cancer, incorporating clinicians with expertise in esophageal cancer, advanced endoscopy, and esophageal surgery into shared decision-making discussions with patients and their families is essential."

It can be complicated by strangulation and perforation which are associated with high mortality rates. Quick diagnosis and attempt at decompression is paramount. Computer-aided tomography is an important diagnostic step, and findings such as gastric wall thickening, extraluminal gas, and mediastinal fluid should prompt urgent surgical intervention. Approaches can include minimally invasive or open operations and in general should include reduction of the hernia, resection of devitalized tissue, and in some cases esophageal exclusion with delayed reconstruction."

    "abstract": "Surgeons are sometimes reluctant to manage uncomplicated appendicitis non-operatively. Reasons cited include the risk of recurrent appendicitis and the risk of missed appendiceal malignancy. The aim of this study was to address these uncertainties and determine the long-term efficacy of antibiotic versus operative management of appendicitis. One-year follow-up of patients enrolled in the multicentre, COVID:HAREM cohort study during March-June 2020 was performed. Initial operative or non-operative management was determined on a case-by-case basis by the responsible surgeon. Outcomes were appendicectomy rate at 1-year, histology of removed appendix and predictors of unsuccessful antibiotic treatment. A total of 625 patients who had non-operative management were included. Emergency appendicectomy had been performed by 1-year in 24% (149/625), with a median time to appendicectomy of 12 days [IQR 1-77] from presentation. Thirty-one patients had elective appendicectomy. Normal histology was reported in 6% of emergency procedures and 58% of elective ones. There were 7 malignancies and 3 neuroendocrine tumors identified at histology. All patients with malignant histology had ≥1 risk factors for malignancy at initial presentation. Faecolithiasis (hazard ratios (HR) 2.3, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.51-3.49) and a high Adult Appendicitis Score (AAS >16; HR 2.44, 95% CI 1.52-3.92) were independent risk factors for unsuccessful non-operative management. At 1 year, 71% of patients managed non-operatively did not undergo an appendicectomy. Recurrence of appendicitis was associated with faecolithiasis and a high AAS. Patients at higher risk for appendiceal malignancy should have targeted follow-up. These factors should be considered when counseling patients on non-operative management."

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) can cause gastrointestinal complications as well as respiratory tract disease. Coagulation abnormalities and thrombosis frequently occur in COVID19, especially in cases with severe clinical outcome. The relationship between gastrointestinal perforation and coagulopathy due to COVID19 remains unclear. A 49-year-old female received Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) therapy for an early recurrence of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) that was refractory to chemotherapy. She was diagnosed with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) because of a fever and oxygen desaturation, and administered tocilizumab. Forty days after completing CAR-T therapy, she was infected with COVID19 and transferred to our hospital. Her general condition worsened and she developed COVID19 pneumonia, and then steroid pulse therapy was started. While her respiratory condition improved, she experienced pain in the anal region and computed tomography (CT) revealed a rectal perforation. An emergency surgery was undertaken, and the lower rectum wall was found to be completely necrotic. Removal of the necrotic part of the rectum tissue, and drainage and lavage of necrotic tissue in the pelvic cavity were performed. The remaining rectum was resected with partial sigmoidectomy, but we could not make the anal stump closed. In addition, an end colostomy in the sigmoid colon was performed. Histopathological findings showed thromboses in the rectal mesentery veins. After the first surgery, the pelvic abscess cavity persisted and her high-grade fever continued. Reoperation was laparoscopically performed, and she underwent a resection of anal canal with residual necrotic rectal and mesorectal tissue, and a drainage of the pelvic abscess. After the reoperation, her general condition improved and CT showed that the abscess cavity had significantly improved. Gastrointestinal perforation, especially rectal necrosis due to coagulopathy caused by severe COVID19 infection, is a rare but life-threatening complication. Physicians should have a high degree of clinical suspicion for timely diagnosis and management, and surgical intervention is necessary in cases of rectal necrosis."

    "abstract": "The urachus is a remnant of the fetal duct that typically obliterates and becomes a fibrous cord after birth. However, in rare cases where this process fails, urachal cysts and other abnormalities can form, often remaining undiagnosed due to their asymptomatic nature. Infection is the primary complication and can be misdiagnosed due to the cyst's obscurity and varied presentations. Delayed diagnosis can lead to severe complications such as sepsis, fistula formation, and cyst rupture, potentially causing peritonitis. This paper discusses a 48-year-old male who consulted in the emergency department with acute abdominal symptoms, was diagnosed with an infected urachal cyst via imaging and successfully treated with antibiotics and subsequent surgical excision."

    "abstract": "Postoperative intussusception (POI) is a remarkably rare complication that may follow different types of operations. POI is responsible for 5-10 % of postoperative bowel obstruction. The main challenge in diagnosing this condition due to its nonspecific symptoms, which mimic post-op ileus. An 8-year-old Syrian female was presented to the emergency department with multiple traumas. Laboratory tests were normal except for leukocytosis. Abdominal and pelvic ultrasound revealed a moderate amount of free fluid in Morison's pouch and splenorenal recess. Investigative laparotomy revealed third-degree splenic rupture, leading to splenorrhaphy. After a week, she suffered from sudden nausea and bilious vomiting. The patient's condition deteriorated, so a second investigative laparotomy was performed and revealed the presence of jejune-jejunal intussusception (1 m distally from the ligament of Treitz) without any predisposing lead point. The intussusception was manually solved, the patient was discharged after five days. She has been seen in follow-up with complete recovery. POI is one of the rare complications that may happen after various surgeries especially abdominal operations. POI is associated with some specific surgeries. The most prominent symptoms of POI are restlessness, bilious vomiting, abdominal distension, and abdominal pain, consequently, they are less specific. POI is a rare complication after surgery but it should be considered in case of the presence of bowel obstruction symptoms in the first two weeks after operation. Our case highlights this unexpected complication emphasizes the need for further studies to demonstrate the mechanism of postoperative intussusception."

    "abstract": "Colonic intussusception is often reported to be related to malignancy in adults. Colonoscopy itself with or without polypectomy is known to be a rare cause of colonic intussusception. We encountered a case in which an individual was diagnosed with intussusception following colonoscopy. The patient was a 44-year-old female who, on the same day, had undergone a colonoscopy including endoscopic mucosal resection for a polyp in the ascending colon. She visited the emergency room with complaints of right-sided abdominal pain. Abdominal examination revealed peritoneal irritation in the right upper quadrant. Abdominal CT revealed colocolic intussusception near the hepatic flexure. This was suspected to have been induced by post-polypectomy electrocoagulation syndrome. A laparoscopic right hemicolectomy was performed because conducting a reduction trial through colonoscopy involves a high risk of peritonitis, in addition to a low likelihood of spontaneous reduction of intussusception due to the additional edema and ischemia resulting from the polypectomy. The patient was discharged without complications six days after the surgery. Though some cases have been reported, there is no treatment strategy for intussusception following colonoscopy. Therefore, we report this case of colonic intussusception following colonoscopy, which was found to be caused by Post-polypectomy Electrocoagulation Syndrome, with a literature review."

These symptoms were a direct result of IGB-induced bowel obstruction. We emphasise that the patient missed the recommended 6-month removal window, which in our opinion is the decisive cause leading to deflated balloon migration and subsequent complications. In the course of managing multiple critical events, the patient required multiple operations related to the bowel obstruction, numerous nutritional and psychological challenges. Currently, the patient is living with short bowel syndrome, secondary to the chronic intestinal failure, necessitating the administration of parenteral nutrition 6 days per week."

A 59-year-old man presented with a three-days history of diffuse abdominal pain associated with distention and obstipation. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed small bowel obstruction (SBO) due to moderately thickened jejunal loop. The SBO was treated conservatively, and after a workup, the patient underwent a laparoscopic oncological small bowel resection. The final pathology sampling revealed transmural sheets of atypical lymphoid cells that were identified as MEITL, which is a very rare type of small bowel lymphoma, by the histo-immunopathoplogy studies. He responded to three courses of chemotherapy, and the patient went into remission at the end of the third chemotherapy session. Five months post remission patient was rushed to the emergency with acute mesenteric ischemia and died shortly after. An extremely uncommon and aggressive type of T-cell lymphoma is called monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T-cell lymphoma (MEITL). Gastrointestinal involvement was detected in the majority of the patients. 40 % of the published cases had stage IV disease. Based on morphological classification, the tumors were classified into two groups: Typical (58 %) and atypical (i.e., non-monomorphic or exhibiting necrosis, angiotropism, or starry-sky pattern) (42 %). Mostly caused by driver gene changes that de-regulate JAK/STAT signaling and histone methylation, it is resistant to standard therapy and includes morphologic and genetic variants that carry a very high clinical risk. We report a case of MEITL detected after jejunal resection in a patient presented initially with SBO. Our patient has a recurrence-free survival of 5 months after chemotherapy, but passed away 5 months after remission due to acute mesenteric ischemia."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis (AA) is a frequent and emergent surgical abdominal condition that presents some particularities and challenges in young children. Data of 402 children aged <16 years with a confirmed diagnosis of AA were retrospectively reviewed. Included patients were divided into two groups: Group A (preschool children aged ≤5 years, n = 44) and Group B (school children aged >5 years, n = 358). Clinical presentation, biological findings, calculated diagnosis scores (paediatric appendicitis score [PAS] and Alvarado score), intraoperative findings and outcomes were comparatively analysed between the two groups. Children of Group A had more likely fever, bowel disorders, diffuse abdominal pain and diffuse tenderness than those of Group B (P = 0.001, P = 0.005, P = 0.006 and P = 0.001, respectively). Regarding biomarkers, the mean of white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels was higher in Group A than in Group B (18,849 cell/mm3 and 162.8 mg/L in Group A versus 15,938 cell/mm3 and 86.7 mg/L in Group B, P = 0.003 and < 0.001, respectively).

    "abstract": "Objective: To explore the impact on safety and prognosis in patients with right-sided colon cancer participating in surgical clinical research. Methods: This retrospective cohort study utilized data from a randomized controlled trial (RELARC study) conducted by the colorectal surgery group at Peking Union Medical College Hospital in which laparoscopic complete mesocolic excision (CME) was compared with D2 radical resection for the management of right-sided colon cancer. The eligibility criteria were age 18-75 years, biopsy-proven colon adenocarcinoma, tumor located between the cecum and right 1/3 of the transverse colon, enhanced chest, abdomen, and pelvic CT scans suggesting tumor stage T2-T4N0M0 or TanyN+ M0, and having undergone radical surgical treatment from January 2016 to December 2019. Exclusion factors included multiple primary colorectal cancers, preoperative stage T1N0 or enlarged central lymph nodes, tumor involving surrounding organs requiring their resection, definite distant metastasis or otherwise unable to undergo R0 resection, history of any other malignant tumors within previous 5 years, intestinal obstruction, perforation, or gastrointestinal bleeding requiring emergency surgery, and assessed as unsuitable for laparoscopic surgery. Patients who had participated in the RELARC study were included in the RELARC group, whereas those who met the inclusion criteria but refused to participate in the RELAEC study were included in the control group. The main indicators studied were the patient's baseline data, surgery and perioperative conditions, pathological characteristics, adjuvant treatment, and postoperative follow-up (including average frequency of follow-up within the first 3 years) and survival (including 3-year disease-free survival rate (DFS) and 3-year overall survival rate (OS). Differences in these indicators between the RELARC and control groups were compared. Results: The study cohort comprised 290 patients, 173 in the RELARC group (RELARC-CME group, 82; RELARC-D2 group, 91) and 117 in the control group (CME control group, 72; D2 control group, 45). There was a significantly higher proportion of overweight patients (BMI ≥24 kg/m2) in the RELARC-CME than in the CME control group (67.1% [55/82] vs. 33.3% [24/72], χ2=17.469, P<0.001). There were no other statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics (all P>0.05). No significant disparities were found between the CME and D2 groups in terms of operation duration, intraoperative blood loss, rate of conversion to open surgery, combined organ resection, intraoperative blood transfusion, or intraoperative complications (all P>0.05). There was a trend toward Clavien-Dindo grade II or higher postoperative complications in the RELARC-CME group (24.4% [20/82]) than in the CME control group (18.1% [13/72]); however, this difference was not statistically significant (χ2=0.914, P=0.339). Similarly, the difference in this rate did not differ significantly between the RELARC-D2 group (25.3% [23/91]) and D2 control group (24.4% [11/45], χ2=0.011, P=0.916). The median duration of postoperative follow-up was significantly shorter in the RELARC groups than in the corresponding control groups. Specifically, the median duration of follow-up was 4.5 (4.5, 4.5) months in the RELARC-CME and 7.2 (6.0, 9.0) months in the CME control group (Z=-10.608, P<0.001). Similarly, the median duration of follow-up was 4.5 (4.5, 4.5) months in the RELARC-D2 group as opposed to 8.3 (6.6, 9.0) months in the D2 control group (Z=-10.595, P<0.001). The 3-year DFS rate (91.5%) and OS rate (96.3%) tended to be higher in the RELARC-CME group than in the CME control group (84.7% and 90.3%, respectively). The 3-year DFS rate (87.9%) and OS rate (96.7%) tended to be higher in the RELARC-D2 group than in the D2 control group (81.8% and 88.6%, respectively); however, these differences were not statistically significant (all P>0.05). Subgroup analysis according to pathological stage revealed that patients in the RELARC-D2 group with pN0 stage achieved a significantly superior 3-year OS rate than did those in the D2 control group (100% vs. 88.9%, P=0.008). We identified no statistically significant differences in survival rates between the remaining subgroups (all P>0.05). Conclusions: A high-quality surgical clinical trial with close follow-up can achieve perioperative safety and a trend toward improved survival outcomes. 目的： 探索参与外科临床研究对右半结肠癌患者术后安全性及预后的影响。 方法： 采用回顾性队列研究的方法。以北京协和医院结直肠专业组腹腔镜完整结肠系膜切除术（CME）对比D2根治切除术治疗右半结肠癌的随机对照研究（RELARC研究）为例，选择2016年1月至2019年12月期间年龄18~75岁、活检病理提示结肠腺癌、肿瘤位于盲肠和横结肠右侧1/3之间、胸腹盆增强CT提示肿瘤分期为T2~4N0M0或TanyN+M0而接受根治性手术治疗患者的临床资料，排除合并多原发结直肠癌、术前评估肿瘤分期为T1N0期或中央淋巴结肿大、肿瘤累及周围器官需行联合器官切除术、明确远处转移或无法行R0切除术、近5年内有任何其他恶性肿瘤病史、合并肠梗阻或肠穿孔及消化道出血等需要急诊手术者以及术前评估不适合腹腔镜手术者。将其中参与RELARC研究者作为RELARC组，对满足入组条件、但拒绝参加RELAEC研究的患者纳入对照组。主要观察指标为患者的基线资料、手术和围手术期情况、肿瘤病理特征及辅助治疗情况以及术后随访（包括术后3年内平均复查频率）和生存情况［包括术后3年无病生存率（DFS）和3年总生存率（OS）］并比较RELARC 组与对照组间的差异。 结果： 共计290例患者纳入研究，其中RELARC组173例，82例接受CME手术（RELARC-CME组），91例接受D2手术（RELARC-D2组）；对照组117例，72例接受CME手术（CME对照组），45例接受D2手术（D2对照组）。除RELARC-CME组超重（体质指数≥24 kg/m2）患者比例显著高于CME对照组［67.1%（55/82）比33.3%（24/72），χ2=17.469，P<0.001］外，其余组间基线资料比较，差异均无统计学意义（均P>0.05）。CME两组及D2两组患者在手术时间、术中出血量、中转开腹比例、联合脏器切除、术中输血和术中并发症发生率的比例差异均无统计学意义（均P>0.05）。术后发生Claiven-DindoⅡ级以上并发症的比例，RELARC-CME组［24.4%（20/82）］高于CME对照组［18.1%（13/72）］，但差异无统计学意义（χ2=0.914，P=0.339）；RELARC-D2组［25.3%（23/91）］与D2对照组［24.4%（11/45）］比较，差异也无统计学意义（χ2=0.011，P=0.916）。RELARC组术后中位随访复查间隔时间明显短于对照组，差异均有统计学意义［RELARC-CME组4.5（4.5，4.5）个月比CME对照组7.2（6.0，9.0）个月（Z=-10.608，P<0.001）；RELARC-D2组4.5（4.5，4.5）个月比D2对照组8.3（6.6，9.0）个月（Z=-10.595，P<0.001）］。RELARC-CME组3年DFS（91.5%）和OS（96.3%）高于CME对照组（84.7%和90.3%），RELARC-D2组3年DFS（87.9%）和OS（96.7%）也高于D2对照组（81.8%和88.6%），但差异均无统计学意义（均P>0.05）；病理分期的亚组分析中，RELARC-D2组中pN0期患者3年OS显著优于D2对照组（100%比88.9%，P=0.008），其余亚组间生存率差异均无统计学意义（均P>0.05）。 结论： 参与具有规范的质量控制及严密随访的外科临床研究，能保障患者围手术期的安全，并且可能有助于改善患者的预后。."

    "abstract": "A Meckel's diverticulum is a true congenital diverticulum arising from the ileum, approximately 2 feet from the ileocaecal junction. Named after Johann Meckel, who first described its embryological origins, the anomaly remains asymptomatic for most. Uncommonly, it is found to be the cause of serious complications such as interstitial obstruction and/or gangrene, bowel perforation, and, in rare cases, internal bowel herniations. A mesodiverticular band is a congenital fibrous band connecting the Meckel's diverticulum to its own mesentery, predisposing it to complications. Both conditions arise from a failure of regression of the vitellointestinal duct and its feeding artery. The presence of a mesodiverticular band significantly raises the possibility of complications, especially those of internal herniation and subsequent bowel obstruction. Detection of a Meckel's diverticulum is challenging in routine investigations such as contrast-enhanced computed tomography, and scintigraphy with Tc99 is required. The availability of such scans is limited, and their use is further difficult in emergent situations such as intestinal obstruction. This condition is, therefore, more frequently detected at laparotomies. Herein, we report a case of intestinal obstruction in a young female who presented to our emergency room with an acute abdomen and was found to have a mesodiverticular band causing internal herniation and subsequent obstruction."

Results The overall occurrence of SSIs within the 30-day follow-up period was significantly lower in the NPD group compared to the conventional dressing group (30% vs. 70%, p < 0.05). The mean duration of hospital stay was 14.85 ± 10.43 days for the NPD group and 15.4 ± 9.75 days for the control group, with no statistically significant difference (p = 0.712). The mean Vancouver Scar Scale score was 5.3 ± 2.47 in the NPD group and 6.5 ± 2.14 in the control group, also showing no statistically significant difference (p = 0.11). Conclusions NPDs significantly reduced the incidence of SSIs compared to conventional dressings, but they did not have a significant impact on scar cosmesis or the duration of hospital stay."

    "title": "Nonoperative Management of a Spontaneous Perforation of Neobladder Secondary to Blackout From Solitary Binge Drinking: A Case Report and Current Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "The orthotopic ileal neobladder is becoming a popular technique of urinary diversion after radical cystectomy (RC) for localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), allowing patient continence, with a more desirable body image and good quality of life. Minimally invasive robot-assisted RC and neobladder have the potential to minimize physical and psychological trauma and are increasingly being adopted for patients with MIBC worldwide. Spontaneous perforation of orthotopic neobladder is uncommon;however, it represents serious complications. Solitary binge drinking can be dangerous in a patient with a neobladder because of reduced level of consciousness and overdistension of the neobladder. We report a case of spontaneous ileal neobladder perforations one year post-robotic RC secondary to blackouts from binge drinking. We also describe nonoperative active management and review the literature. A 66-year-old gentleman was brought by ambulance to our emergency department with a reduced level of consciousness, vomiting, and abdominal pain in the early hours of the morning. Collateral history revealed that he had drunk alcohol alone the night before at his home where he lives alone. Initial examination revealed tachycardia and hypotension. Immediate resuscitation using the sepsis six protocol included intravenous normal saline, blood culture, broad-spectrum antibiotic, lactate measurement, and insertion of a urethral catheter to monitor urine output. Following contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdomen and pelvis, the patient was referred to a urologist. A diagnosis of spontaneous perforation of the neobladder was made. A nonoperative or 'conservative' management approach was adopted with careful active monitoring at the intensive care unit (ICU) involving a multidisciplinary team. Follow-up CT was performed to assess radiological recovery. The patient recovered successfully and was discharged home five weeks post-admission with an indwelling urethral catheter. The catheter was removed 10 weeks post-admission following a cystogram confirming the integrity of the neobladder. The patient has preserved neobladder function and continence and is doing well until the last follow-up at six months post-discharge. Patients with neobladder should be rigorously counseled about the importance of timed voiding, intermittent self-catheter, serious consequences of solitary binge drinking, and urinary retention."

    "abstract": "Intestinal duplication cyst is an infrequent congenital malformation that can involve all the segments of the gastrointestinal tract. The cases of intestinal duplication cyst involving the colon, appendix, and ileum in children are particularly uncommon. The symptoms of abdominal pain are similar to other acute abdominal diseases in children, such as appendicitis, intussusception, and intestinal obstruction, so sometimes its diagnosis is challenging and leads to misdiagnosis. We report a 4-year-old Asian boy who presented to the pediatric emergency department with abdominal pain and vomiting but no fever, peritonitis, or mass. No abdominal abnormality was found via radiology and ultrasonography. After 2 days' anti-inflammatory therapy, the patient was discharged with pain relief. A total of 9 months later, he was readmitted to the pediatric emergency department for the same complaint as the first admission. Abdominal physical examination and ultrasound examination were still negative. Barium examination found a large mass in the colon. Colonoscopy was performed before operation to confirm the rare co-cavity intestinal duplication cyst involving the colon, appendix, and ileum. After resection of intestinal duplication and ileocolonic anastomosis, the patient's abdominal pain and vomiting has not recurred for 5 years postoperatively. The diagnosis of intestinal duplication cyst in children is difficult, especially the rare co-cavity and long segmental intestinal duplication, which is easily misdiagnosed. Colonoscopy may be an effective auxiliary diagnostic method, especially for diseases that are difficult to diagnosed clinically, such as recurrent abdominal pain."

    "abstract": "On the basis of our extensive experience in same-day discharge (SDD) sleeve gastrectomy, we extended this management strategy to anastomotic metabolic and bariatric surgeries (MBS). To retrospectively analyze early outcomes (≤30 d) after anastomotic MBS with planned SDD (≤12 hr). University Hospital, Canada; Public Practice. SDD anastomotic MBS were proposed with strict preoperative criteria and included single-anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-S), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB), and single-anastomosis sleeve ileal bypass (SASI). Enhanced recovery after bariatric surgery protocols and post-anesthesia care unit criteria were followed. Unplanned overnight stay, emergency department (ED) visit, readmission, morbidity-mortality, and reintervention rates were analyzed. Since 2021, 208 patients (191 female and 17 male) have undergone SDD anastomotic MBS, with 76% conversion procedures: 92 SADI-S, 72 RYGB, 35 OAGB, and 9 SASI (mean age = 41.4 yr and mean preoperative body mass index = 41.9 kg/m2). Unplanned overnight stays and ED visits were 4.8% and 4.3%, respectively. Readmission rate was 5.8% (5 SADI-S, 5 RYGB, 1 OAGB, and 1 SASI). Overall morbidity rate was 14.9%, including 3.9% major complications. Within 30 days postoperatively, there were 2 duodenal leaks, 1 intrabdominal collection, 1 common bile duct stenosis, and 1 acute appendicitis in the SADI-S group. There were 2 occlusions on the jejunojejunal anastomosis and 1 bleeding on the gastrojejunal anastomosis in the RYGB group. Five (2.4%) required reintervention with no mortality. We report low and acceptable rates of unplanned overnight stay, readmission, and reintervention. Early outcomes suggest that SDD anastomotic MBS seems safe and feasible with an experienced team, selective criteria, and appropriate postoperative follow-up."

A total of 70 consecutive patients (mean±SD age: 71.1±15.5 years, 51.4% were males) who underwent emergency surgery for the left colon were included in this retrospective cohort study. Data on patient demographics, primary diagnosis, emergency surgery indication, operative risk, stoma type (Hartmann's procedure, primary anastomosis with diverting loop ileostomy, double-barreled ostomy), surgeon sub-specialty, postoperative complications, and stoma reversal time and rates were recorded. Hartmann's procedure (72.9%) was the most commonly utilized stoma type, followed by primary anastomosis with diverting loop ileostomy (14.3%) and double-barreled ostomy (10.0%), while primary anastomosis was performed only in 2.8% of patients. The stoma reversal rate was 25.0%, and the median time to stoma reversal was 10 months (range, 3 to 48 months). Hartmann's procedure was less commonly performed by colorectal surgeons than by general surgeons (35.3% vs. 68.4%, p=0.013) and was associated with a lower chance of stoma reversal compared to other stoma types, including primary anastomosis with diverting loop ileostomy and double-barreled ostomy (15.7% vs. 52.9%, p=0.006). In conclusion, our findings revealed that Hartmann's procedure, although performed less commonly by colorectal surgeons than by general surgeons, was still the most prevalent procedure applied for the surgical management of left colon emergencies, particularly in the setting of tumor-induced obstruction or perforation, despite the potential risk of severe postoperative complications and lower stoma reversal rates with this procedure."

    "abstract": "In patients undergoing appendectomy, postoperative complications are more likely to occur with complicated appendicitis. Abdominal drainage may occasionally be used to prevent such scenarios. It is unclear, though, how abdominal drains help to reduce problems after surgery. Pediatric patients who underwent appendectomy for complicated appendicitis at a tertiary center between October 2021 and September 2022 were reviewed retrospectively. Following appendectomy, patients with and without peritoneal drains were contrasted in terms of preoperative characteristics and postoperative outcomes. Thirty-seven of 83 patients (44.58%) undergoing emergency laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis received abdominal drainage. The drain group had longer hospital stay (9 days [IQR 6-11] vs. 6 days [IQR 4-8], P=0.0002) and longer time to CRP normalization (6 days [IQR 4-9.5] vs. 8 days [7-12], P=0.0222) compared to the no-drain group. The drain group also had a higher complication rate (30.56% vs. 23.81%, P=0.6107), although such finding was not statistically significant. The use of abdominal drains after laparoscopic appendectomy did not significantly prevent postoperative complications in complicated appendicitis. Instead, it was associated with longer hospitalization, although patients in the drain group are likely to have experienced more severe conditions."

We presented a case of 7 year's old child with no known medical illness presented with acute onset vague abdominal pain experienced for three days. he was symptomatically treated as Acute gastroenteritis and dyspepsia later diagnosed with acute appendicitis and underwent laparotomy. He has malrotated subhepatic cecum with Subhepatic gangrenous appendicitis Open appendectomy done and discharged improved. Subhepatic appendicitis is a condition where the appendix is abnormally located in the upper right abdomen. This atypical placement often leads to delayed diagnosis and complications due to its similar symptoms to other abdominal diseases. While ultrasound is a valuable tool for diagnosis, laparoscopic appendectomy is the preferred treatment method when available. However, in resource-limited settings without laparoscopic capabilities, open surgery is necessary. Subhepatic appendicitis is a rare occurrence and its infrequent location makes it difficult to diagnose. Awareness of various location of appendix, a high index of suspicion and radiological imaging is required for prompt diagnosis and management. Appendicitis in subhepatic appendix and high up cecum creates a lot of confusion in both diagnosis and surgical exploration which may lead in complication and delay in treatment."

A 61-year-old male patient with abdominal pain and umbilical pus was admitted to the emergency room. Abdominal computed tomography revealed peritonitis with multiple intra-abdominal abscesses. The patient was diagnosed with peritonitis resulting from urachal cyst rupture. Laparoscopic drainage of the abscesses and excising of the umbilicus and intra-abdominal fistula tract were performed. Antibiotics were administered, and the patient was discharged uneventfully. The rarity of peritonitis caused by infection and urachal cyst rupture can make diagnosing omphalitis challenging. Therefore, in this case report and literature review, we discuss the diagnosis and treatment of complicated omphalitis, which rarely progresses to peritonitis owing to ruptured urachal cysts."

    "abstract": "Stercoral perforation of the colon is a rare and life-threatening condition caused by pressure necrosis due to fecal impaction. It is commonly associated with chronic constipation, particularly in patients with neurogenic bowel disorders or prolonged opioid use. However, its occurrence in the context of chronic heroin use is rarely reported. We report the case of a 40-year-old male with a 5-year history of heroin abuse who presented with diffuse abdominal pain, vomiting, and cessation of gas and stool passage for 10 days. Physical examination revealed a distended abdomen with generalized tenderness, guarding, and a rectal examination confirmed fecal impaction. Computed tomography (CT) showed massive fecal impaction in the sigmoid colon with pneumoperitoneum, indicating perforation. The patient underwent urgent exploratory laparotomy, revealing two perforations in the sigmoid colon with extensive fecal peritonitis. A segmental resection of the sigmoid colon with colostomy was performed. Postoperatively, the patient required intensive care for septic shock but eventually recovered and was referred to an addiction treatment program. This case highlights the serious gastrointestinal complications associated with chronic opioid use, particularly heroin. The pathophysiology involves opioid-induced inhibition of gastrointestinal motility, leading to chronic constipation, fecaloma formation, and subsequent perforation. Early recognition and prompt surgical intervention are crucial in managing stercoral perforation, which carries a high mortality rate if delayed. This case underscores the importance of recognizing gastrointestinal risks in chronic opioid users, especially heroin, and the need for integrated care strategies to prevent severe complications like stercoral perforation."

    "abstract": "As the important barrier of intraocular tissue, cornea is easy to suffer various kinds of injuries. Among them, acute alkali burn is a thorny ophthalmic emergency event, which can lead to corneal persistent epithelial defects, ulcers, and even perforation. Ferroptosis, a mode of regulatory cell death, has been found to play a key role in the process of corneal alkali burn, of which lipid peroxidation and intracellular iron levels are considered to be the possible therapeutic targets. To seek new effective treatments, the study herein focused on the occurrence of oxidative stress and ferroptosis in corneal alkali burn, exploring the role of phytic acid (PA), a natural small molecule with both antioxidant and iron chelating capacity, in the repair of corneal epithelial injury. The in vivo therapeutic results showed that PA eyedrops treatment promoted the recovery of corneal morphology and function, and in vitro experiments proved that PA prompted the repair of oxidative stress induced-corneal epithelial injury through ferroptosis inhibition. In addition, better drug treatment effect could be achieved through hydrogel delivery and sustained release, and our in vivo experiments showed the superior therapeutic effects of PA delivered by PVA hydrogels with larger molecular weights on corneal injury. In summary, this study demonstrated the excellent effect of natural small molecule PA with antioxidant and high efficiency chelating ferrous ions on ferroptosis inhibition, and showed the outstanding application prospect of PVA/PA hydrogels in the treatment of corneal epithelial injury."

We present a case of a 59-year-old woman hemodynamically stable with firearm injury to the left buttock. CT examination showed free air in the peritoneal cavity and in the retroperitoneum and a focal contrast extravasation within the uterine fundus. The patient underwent urgent laparotomy that revealed triple bowel perforation (sigmoid colon, medium rectum, ileum) and a laceration of the posterior and anterior uterine wall at level of the cervix with no signs of active bleeding. The bullet was lodged above the peritoneal reflection, in the right pelvis, and it was removed, and handed over to the judicial authority. The perforated bowel segments were resected with Hartmann's procedure and ileal anastomosis. The uterine laceration was repaired. Although all the viscera and the structures along the trajectory can be harmed, pelvic gunshot wounds have the potential to inflict serious injury. Nongravid uterine traumas are a unique occurrence, and proper care requires an understanding of lesion grading. Finding the gynecological lesion in female patients is essential to receiving the best care and protecting the reproductive system."

This study aimed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound and CT for AA. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with AA who underwent emergency surgery at our hospital from March 2021 to August 2023, with postoperative pathological results as the gold standard. Differences in the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound and CT for different types of AA, age groups, and body mass index (BMI) values were then analyzed. The overall sample comprised 279 confirmed cases of AA, with 64 cases of simple appendicitis, 127 cases of suppurative appendicitis, and 88 cases of gangrenous appendicitis. For these three pathological classifications, the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound was 68.75% (44/64), 73.22% (93/127), and 81.81% (72/88), respectively, while the diagnostic accuracy of CT was 71.87% (46/64), 82.67% (105/127), and 90.90% (80/88), respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in the overall diagnostic accuracy between the two methods (P > 0.05). Subgroup analysis showed no difference in diagnostic accuracy between the two methods for patients with normal BMI (P > 0.05). However, for overweight, obese, and elderly patients, CT provided significantly better diagnostic accuracy than ultrasound (P < 0.05). While ultrasound and CT have similar diagnostic accuracy for different pathological types of AA, CT is more accurate for overweight, obese, and elderly patients."

We searched PubMed, Scopus, WOS, and Cochrane Central until June 2023 to include all relevant studies that compared retrograde approach versus antegrade approach in patients with CTO PCI. We synthesized the outcome data using a random-effects model, expressing the effect estimates as odds ratios (OR) or mean difference (MD) with corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CI).

The dual location of strangulation constitutes a critical surgical emergency due to the heightened risk of intestinal necrosis and septic shock. Given the rarity of this condition, there is a notable paucity of detailed information in the literature, and the management strategies are poorly codified. We report the case of a 23-year-old man with a history of bowel transit disorders (diarrhea and constipation), who was admitted as an emergency with typical signs of acute large bowel obstruction. Initial diagnosis of sigmoid volvulus was retained; however, intraoperative findings revealed an associated volvulus of both the transverse and sigmoid colon. A left colectomy was performed followed by colorectal anastomosis. The postoperative period was uneventful. Synchronous volvulus of the transverse and sigmoid colon is an extremely rare occurrence; it should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses of acute large bowel obstruction. There is scarcity of information in the literature regarding synchronous sigmoid and transverse colon volvulus. Synchronous volvulus of the transverse and sigmoid colon is an exceedingly rare clinical entity. Diagnosing this condition can be difficult and the management effectiveness remains controversial. It is presumed that sigmoid volvulus is the initial event; therefore, emphasizing the need for early surgical intervention for sigmoid volvulus could potentially improve outcomes."

However, there is limited multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence comparing APD with temporary hemodialysis (HD) for this indication in China. This multicenter RCT enrolled 116 patients with ESRD requiring urgent dialysis from 11 hospitals, randomized to APD or HD. Patients underwent a 2-week treatment with APD or HD via a temporary central venous catheter (CVC), followed by a maintenance PD. Outcomes were assessed over 12 months during 8 visits. The primary outcome was dialysis-related complications. The 1-year incidence of dialysis-related complications was significantly lower in the APD group than in the HD group (25.9% vs. 56.9%, P = 0.001). No significant differences were found between the groups in terms of PD catheter survival rates (P = 0.388), peritonitis-free survival rates (P = 0.335), and patient survival rates (P = 0.329). In terms of health economics, the total direct medical cost of the initial hospitalization for patients with ESRD was significantly lower in the APD group (27,008.39 CNY) than in the HD group (42,597.54 CNY) (P = 0.001), whereas the duration of the first hospital stay showed no significant difference (P = 0.424). For patients with ESRD needing urgent initiation of dialysis, APD was associated with a lower incidence of dialysis-related complications and lower initial hospitalization costs compared with HD, with no significant differences in PD catheter survival rate, peritonitis-free survival rates, or patient survival rates. These findings can guide clinical decision-making for the optimal dialysis modality for patients requiring urgent dialysis initiation."

    "abstract": "A diaphragmatic hernia (DH) is a defect within a part of the diaphragm that allows intra-abdominal contents to enter the thoracic cavity. Diaphragmatic hernias can be congenital or acquired later in life. The most common congenital DH is the Bochdalek hernia (posterolateral hernia), but the most commonly acquired DH is due to traumatic injury. These hernias are rare in adults and are typically diagnosed incidentally. Surgical repair is the standard of care; however, data regarding the surgical approach is scarce. We report a case of a rare right posterolateral DH in an adult female patient who presented with acute abdominal pain. A 69-year-old female presented with recurrent epigastric pain that had acutely worsened, nausea, vomiting, and food intolerance. A computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a right posterolateral DH containing the hepatic flexure of the colon. The patient was taken urgently to surgery due to concern for strangulation. Reduction of the hernia was attempted laparoscopically but was converted to an open procedure with a subcostal incision due to poor visualization. This approach revealed adequate exposure of the defect and subsequent reduction of the herniated abdominal contents. The defect was easily closed without tension or the use of mesh. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 3. Chronic DH can have severe life-threatening sequelae when left untreated. This case demonstrates the importance of thorough history-taking and raises awareness of missed diaphragmatic injuries in trauma situations. Since patients who present with a symptomatic DH often need urgent repair, it is important for surgeons working in the acute care setting to understand the surgical options available and when mesh placement may benefit the situation. Our case outlines a successful primary defect repair, without mesh, of a right-sided DH in which a minimally invasive technique was attempted but converted to laparotomy for patient safety."

This report discusses an unusual case of ileal perforation peritonitis caused by ingestion of a chicken bone. A 60-year-old male presented with acute generalized abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting for three days. A physical examination revealed signs of peritonitis. Imaging results were unremarkable. Emergency laparotomy revealed perforation in the ileum caused by the chicken bone. The perforated segment was resected, and primary anastomosis was performed. Ingestion of foreign bodies, although common, rarely leads to gastrointestinal perforations. Among these foreign bodies, chicken bones are rarely reported, making the diagnosis challenging because of nonspecific symptoms and low clinical suspicion. Prompt surgical intervention is crucial for managing complications such as peritonitis and sepsis. This case highlights the importance of considering foreign body ingestion in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain, particularly in patients without an obvious cause of peritonitis. Early detection and timely surgical intervention are essential to improve patient outcomes."

In the context of Parkinson's disease (PD), there is a large overlap between the non-motor symptoms of PD, common gastrointestinal symptoms amongst the elderly population, and symptoms associated with acute, severe GI pathology, which can result in diagnostic overshadowing. Here, a 68-year-old man with a background of PD reported nausea, constipation, and abdominal discomfort during routine frailty review by his general practitioner (GP). The patient reported these were common symptoms which usually resolved with laxatives. Aware of the potentially sinister nature of this presentation, the GP arranged transfer to the emergency department where CT subsequently revealed a closed-loop small bowel obstruction.

The patient had no symptoms or signs of an acute abdomen, and within three days he developed significant unilateral scrotal swelling and skin changes. Our case demonstrates the need to treat Fournier's gangrene as a consequence of an intra-abdominal infectious disease, particularly in elderly comorbid patients with atypical symptoms of acute appendicitis, and highlights the importance of early surgical intervention."

    "title": "From Volvulus to Short Bowel Syndrome: The Impact of Extensive Gangrene.",
    "abstract": "Compound volvulus, also known as ileosigmoid knotting, is an unusual but dangerous surgical condition that causes intestinal obstruction. It is a rare condition when an area of the small intestines is twisted and interrupts the blood supply, a closed-loop obstruction that is not common for one of the causes of intestinal blockage. Still, it is essential to distinguish the difference between an ileosigmoid knot and a simple sigmoid volvulus from each other, which are managed differently. Unlike abdominal X-rays, which are often nothing but clear images, CT scans or MRIs in their place provide more precise diagnostic information to help this problem diagnosis be traced. The first step in treating the patient is to immediately do an emergency laparotomy if the case involves ileosigmoid knotting, and which specific surgical procedure to use-resectional or non-resectional-is determined by the surgeon during the operation, who is considering such scales as the extent of the affected vascular compromise, the presence of necrosis or perforation, and the overall viability of the involved intestinal loops to conduct the most sought-after therapy.  In this case, the 45-year-old male presented with insidious-onset abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation, along with signs of dehydration and hypotension. Physical examination revealed a distended abdomen, absent bowel sounds, and elevated white blood count and lactate levels, with an erect abdominal X-ray showing a dilated bowel, suggesting acute bowel obstruction with possible ischemia. This clinical presentation is consistent with acute bowel obstruction, potentially due to ileosigmoid knotting, which requires urgent surgical intervention. Short bowel syndrome is a malabsorptive disorder characterized by the presence of less than 200 cm of the small bowel, sometimes as a result of congenital or surgical causes. This is a real problem for an individual because he or she must be cautious and watch what they eat and how much they eat fortified foodstuffs, as the decreased absorptive capability of the small intestine can restrict the body's ability to take in and make use of necessary nutrients, fluids, and electrolytes."

    "abstract": "In the emergency department, blunt trauma to the abdomen is frequently seen following a blunt injury. Road traffic accidents are the leading cause of this type of injury. This is a case presentation of a young adult male who presented to the emergency medicine department one week after he had a road traffic accident. After the initial assessment, an ileal perforation with peritonitis was suspected, and the patient was taken up for surgery. Intraoperative findings led to the patient being diagnosed with a case of gangrenous ileum secondary to a complete mesenteric tear. This case report highlights how a high level of suspicion and prompt intervention in a timely manner can play an important role in reducing morbidity and case fatality."

    "abstract": "Acute abdomen is a common and urgent clinical condition requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment. This study determines the clinical and epidemiological profile of patients presenting with acute abdomen at a tertiary care hospital. To describe the demographic characteristics, provisional diagnoses, treatment modalities, and pain management effectiveness in patients with acute abdomen. This prospective observational study was conducted in the Emergency Medicine department at Dr. D. Y. Patil Medical College, Hospital & Research Center, Pimpri, Pune, over a specified period. The study included patients presenting with acute abdomen, aged above 14 years, excluding those with traumatic acute abdomen and pregnant patients. A sample size of 146 was calculated based on the proportion of ureteric colic cases, with a 95% confidence interval and a 6% margin of error; however, a total of 176 patients were included in the study. Data collection involved recording demographic details, clinical features, provisional diagnoses, and pain scores, as well as performing required blood investigations and ultrasonography. Pain scores were assessed before and after treatment. Patients will be given non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or opioid analgesia, depending on the clinical severity. Emergency medicine residents, in consultation with the on-call consultant, determined the disposition of patients, deciding if they required surgical or conservative management. The study found that the majority of patients, n = 130 (73.86%), were aged 26-50 years, with cases n = 103 (58.52%) being males and cases n = 73 (41.48%) females. Acute appendicitis was the most common diagnosis, n = 41 (24.43%), followed by urolithiasis n = 33 (18.75%). Surgical interventions were required for n = 78 (45.08%) of patients, highlighting the urgent nature of these conditions. Pain management was effective, with significant reductions in pain scores post-treatment (mean visual analog score (VAS) decreased from 6.22 to 2.33, and mean numerical rating score (NRS) from 6.05 to 2.10; p < 0.001). The study underscores the high prevalence of gastrointestinal and renal conditions in patients with acute abdomen, particularly in middle-aged adults. The high rate of surgical interventions reflects the urgent nature of these conditions. Significant reductions in pain scores demonstrated effective pain management. Comprehensive care strategies are essential for optimizing patient outcomes. Future research with larger sample sizes and multi-center participation is recommended to validate these findings and enhance management protocols for acute abdomen."

    "abstract": "Lower abdominal pain is a common complaint for patients presenting for evaluation in the emergency department. Among other life-threatening complications, acute appendicitis needs to be ruled out in the case of right-lower quadrant pain (RLQ). Sigmoid perforation caused by an ingested foreign body is an uncommon cause of RLQ pain. This report presents the case of an otherwise healthy, 29-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with RLQ pain. His initial evaluation raised concern for acute appendicitis. However, during his exploratory laparoscopy, he was found to have a perforated sigmoid colon due to a skewer stick; the patient had no recollection of having ingested any foreign body. This paper highlights the importance of considering the possibility of sigmoid perforation by an ingested foreign body as a possible cause of RLQ pain. The article also reviews the most common causes of ingested foreign bodies, their potential complications and management."

    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: This study aimed to determine the risk factors associated with postoperative major morbidity, anastomotic/suture leakage, re-surgery and mortality in patients undergoing emergency surgery for colonic perforation. Methods: A total of 204 adult patients treated surgically for colonic perforation from 2016 to 2021 at the University Hospital Erlangen were included in a retrospective analysis. Patient demographics and pre-, intra- and postoperative parameters were obtained and evaluated among various outcome groups (in-hospital major morbidity, anastomotic/suture leakage, re-surgery and 90-day mortality). Results: Postoperative in-hospital major morbidity, anastomotic/suture leakage, need of re-surgery and 90-day mortality occurred in 45%, 12%, 25% and 12% of the included patients, respectively. Independent risk factors for in-hospital major morbidity were identified and included the presence of any comorbidity, a significantly reduced preoperative general condition, the localization of perforation in the right hemicolon and the need for an intraoperative blood transfusion. The only independent risk factor for anastomotic/suture leakage was the presence of any comorbidity, whereas no independent risk factors for re-surgery were found. An age > 65 years, a significantly reduced preoperative general condition and the need for an intraoperative blood transfusion were independent risk factors for 90-day mortality. Conclusions: Our study identified risk factors impacting postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing emergency surgery for colonic perforation. These patients should receive enhanced postoperative care and may benefit from individualized and targeted therapeutic approaches."

    "abstract": "(1) Background: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly prescribed for gastric disorders. In patients with liver cirrhosis, PPI use is associated with an increased risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and increased mortality rates; therefore, they should be used with caution. This study aims to evaluate the appropriateness of PPI prescriptions in hospitalized cirrhotic patients against current clinical guidelines to identify patterns of misuse and guide better prescribing practices. (2) Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on liver cirrhosis inpatients in an internal medicine department from January 2022 to May 2023. The primary measure was the proportion of PPI prescriptions aligned with clinical guidelines. Medical files were entirely reviewed by researchers to assess the appropriateness of PPI prescriptions using the current guidelines. Outcomes included the identification of common reasons for PPI prescription and the rate of inappropriate PPI use among the study population. (3) Results: The study included 189 cirrhotic patients, with PPIs prescribed to 95 (50.2%) patients during hospitalization and 75 (39.7%) patients at discharge. Among those, 47.4% of the inpatients and 34.7% at discharge had no valid indication for PPI administration. The most common reason for PPI prescription during hospital stays was gastritis, followed by antiplatelet use in high-risk patients, ulcers, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The most common inappropriate indication was portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG), followed by treatment with corticosteroids and anticoagulants alone. We did not find an association between PPI administration during hospital stays and infections. Only in 4% of cases patients should have received PPIs and did not. (4) Conclusions: There is a concerning overprescription of PPIs in cirrhotic patients, often deviating from established guidelines. It subjects patients to unnecessary risks. There is an urgent need for increased awareness and adherence to clinical guidelines regarding PPI prescriptions in cirrhotic patients."

    "abstract": "Background: Recently, there has been a significant increase in the utilization of self-expandable metallic stents (SEMSs) for treating malignant colorectal obstructions through colorectal stenting. The mechanical properties of SEMSs are usually considered to affect clinical outcomes of patients with malignant colorectal obstructions. Methods: This single-arm, prospective, multicenter study of SEMS with a lower axial force and high axial force zero-border included 200 patients with malignant colorectal obstruction. Technical and clinical success, stent patency, and adverse events associated with SEMS placement were evaluated. Results: One patient was excluded, and 199 patients were evaluated. The treatment intent was bridge-to-surgery in 129 and palliation in 70 patients. Technical and clinical success rates were 99.5% and 97.0%, respectively. The percentage of the ColoRectal Obstruction Scoring System scores of 3 or higher improved significantly from 19.2% before placement to 93.9% after placement. Clinical success was not achieved in five patients due to insufficient stent expansion in four patients and stent occlusion in one patient. Only one patient underwent emergency surgery for perforation of the proximal colon, far from where the stent was placed; the rescue procedure was not performed, despite no improvement in proximal dilatation due to insufficient stent expansion. Among the palliation cohort, 15 patients received chemotherapy, including molecular-targeted agents such as bevacizumab. There were no fatal cases related to stent placement. Conclusions: For management of malignant colorectal obstruction, this newly developed SEMS with low axial force and a high axial force zero-border showed high technical and clinical success rates, and an extremely low perforation rate (0.5%)."

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of temperature on AMI admission. This was a retrospective, multicentric study. The medical records of 1477 patients with verified AMI who were consecutively admitted to 3 hospitals anytime between January 2010 and December 2020 were included in the study. Distributed lag non-linear model was applied, the model was adjusted for temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, year, holiday, day of the week, time and seasonality. AMI exhibited obvious sex preference, AMI patients tended to be male (M/F ratio = 2.3:1) and in their late 50 s. Hospital admissions of acute mesenteric arterial thromboembolism (AMAT) increased significantly with high temperatures on day of exposure and lag 0-14 day. The effect curve of daily average temperature on acute mesenteric venous thromboembolism (AMVT) admission was J-shaped, and the duration of cold effect was longer, while the duration of heat effect was shorter. An increase in hospital admissions of AMVT was found above 20 °C at lag 0-30. For the first time, our study indicated that temperature is significantly associated with the risk of AMI. Although it is not possible to always avoid exposure to extreme temperatures, one should be aware of dramatic temperature fluctuations and take appropriate precautions."

A retrospective nationwide analysis included patients ≥18 years old undergoing surgery for acute cholecystitis (AC), acute appendicitis (AA), perforated ulcer (PU) and ileus. The database of the chief surgeon of the Russian Ministry of Health for 2018 - 2022 was used. To investigate possible reasons influencing the level of emergency laparoscopic surgeries, we performed online survey of medical organizations connected to the electronic reporting system. Over five years, the incidence of laparoscopic surgeries for AC increased from 52.6% to 70.5% (p<0.001), for AA from 25.1% to 41.0% (p<0.001), for PU from 9.4% to 13.2% (p<0.001) and for ileus from 5.9% to 8.5% (p<0.001). The percentage of emergency laparoscopic surgeries in rural hospitals (level I) was 14.8%, level II hospitals - 40.2%, level III - 67.7% (p<0.001). We obtained responses from 1.982 (84.9%) out of 2.335 hospitals included in the database. Significant differences were revealed in equipment of hospitals of different levels with laparoscopic surgical systems and proportion of surgeons proficient in laparoscopic techniques (p<0.001). The same factors influence laparoscopy in different federal districts to a greater extent than their geographic and demographic characteristics. Laparoscopic emergency procedures became more widespread, but vary widely between regions, urban and rural. Availability of laparoscopic surgery is influenced by availability of equipment and trained surgeons, geographic distance and population density, level of hospital and ability to maintain acquired skills and increase experience in appropriate surgeries. Определить текущее состояние и основные факторы, влияющие на уровень неотложной лапароскопической хирургии в Российской Федерации. В ретроспективный общенациональный анализ включены пациенты 18 лет и более, оперированные по поводу острого холецистита (ОХ), острого аппендицита (ОА), перфоративной язвы и острой спаечной кишечной непроходимости (ОСКН). Использована база данных главного хирурга Минздрава России за 2018—2022 гг. Для исследования возможных причин, влияющих на уровень внедрения неотложных лапароскопических операций, проведен онлайн-опрос медицинских организаций, подключенных к системе электронной отчетности. За 5 лет частота лапароскопических операций увеличилась при ОХ с 52,6 до 70,5% (p<0,001), при ОА с 25,1 до 41,0% (p<0,001), при перфоративных гастродуоденальных язвах с 9,4 до 13,2% (p<0,001), при ОСКН с 5,9 до 8,5% (p<0,001). Удельный вес неотложных лапароскопических операций в больницах, расположенных в сельской местности (I уровень), составил 14,8%, в больницах II уровня — 40,2%, III уровня — 67,7% (p<0,001). На предложенную анкету получены ответы от 1982 (84,9%) больниц из 2335 включенных в базу данных. Выявлены значимые различия в оснащении больниц разных уровней лапароскопическими хирургическими системами и в доле хирургов, владеющих лапароскопической техникой (p<0,001). Эти же факторы в большей степени влияют на различия в применении лапароскопии по федеральным округам, нежели их географические и демографические особенности. Применение лапароскопических операций в неотложной хирургии на национальном уровне возрастает, однако в отдельных регионах, в городах и сельской местности широко варьирует. На доступность лапароскопической хирургии влияет целый ряд факторов: от обеспеченности оборудованием и подготовленными хирургами до географической удаленности и плотности проживания населения; от уровня больницы, в которой оказывается хирургическая помощь, до возможности систематически поддерживать приобретенные навыки и наращивать опыт выполнения операций."

    "abstract": "COVID-19 has further burdened the Brazilian healthcare system, especially emergencies. Patients may have delayed seeking care for surgical abdominal pain. Delays in the approach may have impacted clinical evolution and outcomes. This study evaluated appendectomies and their complications performed by the public system during one-year follow-up of COVID-19 in a hospital in southern Brazil. In this hospital-based cross-sectional study, we included adult patients who underwent appendectomy from March 2019 to April 2021 (n = 162). Patients were divided into pre-pandemic (n = 78) and pandemic (n = 84) groups based on the surgery date. The analyzed variables included hospitalization duration, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, surgical approach, histopathological findings, COVID-19 testing, patient outcomes, and 30-day survival rate. The cohorts exhibited similar epidemiology, with the sex ratio and average age being maintained. No statistical difference was found in the 30-day survival rate and clinical outcomes. Of the four patients admitted to the ICU, three belonged to the pandemic cohort and tested negative for COVID-19. Only 47.6 % of the patients in the pandemic cohort underwent COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction examination; one tested positive (2.5 %). This study demonstrated that there was no increased risk for appendectomies during the first wave of the pandemic. Surgeries were safe during this period. Patients continued to access the emergency service despite surgical abdominal pain and restrictive measures imposed by health authorities. The similar results observed across cohorts are attributed to the readiness of the teams and the availability of medical surgical equipment in safe quantities."

    "abstract": "Internal hernias are relatively uncommon occurrences in cases of mechanical bowel obstructions. They occur when the small bowel herniates through a recess or defect within the abdominal cavity. Herniation through a defect in the broad ligament is particularly rare among internal herniations. We present the case of an 88-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with a history of abdominal pain and obstipation. The patient had undergone open tubectomy 43 years ago. Erect abdominal radiograph and contrast-enhanced computed tomography confirmed the presence of intestinal obstruction. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a viable small intestinal loop herniating through a defect in the right broad ligament. The herniated bowel loop was reduced, and the defect was closed. The contralateral side was examined to confirm the absence of defects in the left broad ligament. Early diagnosis of internal hernia through broad ligament defect requires a high index of suspicion, and the advent of computed tomography has facilitated early preoperative diagnosis. Rapid management is necessary to prevent catastrophic sequelae such as strangulation and gangrenous changes in the herniated bowel."

Retrospective analysis of patients undergoing DCS between 2014 and 2019. SOFA and APACHE II scores were calculated using parameters preceding DCS, while MPI was based on surgical descriptions. Statistical analysis: Qualitative variables were compared using the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, and quantitative variables using Pearson's correlation coefficient. The Student's T test was employed for mean comparisons. The sample comprised 104 patients (59 males), with a median age of 63.5 years, of whom 52 (50%) were ASA IV. Operative findings leading to DCS included peritonitis (54; 51.9%), intestinal ischemia (39; 37.5%), inability to close the abdomen (8; 7.6%), and bleeding (3; 2.9%). The mortality rate was 75% (78/104). Thirty patients (28.8%) died after DCS; the remainder underwent one (35; 33.6%), two (21; 20.2%); three (8; 7.7%), and four or more (10;9.7%) revision procedures. The median lengths of ICU and hospital stays were 12.5 and 20.5 days, respectively. The median score values were as follows: SOFA: 12 (0-38), APACHE II: 25 (2-47), and MPI: 26 (8-43). Besides ASA classification (p = 0.03), mortality risk was influenced by: age (≤ 65 years vs. > 65 years; p = 0.04), SOFA (≤ 10 vs. > 10; p = 0.03), APACHE II (≤ 25 vs. > 25; p = 0.04), and MPI (≤ 25 vs. > 25; p = 0.003).

A novel adhesive endoscopic hemostatic powder (UI-EWD/NexpowderTM, Nextbiomedical, Incheon, South Korea) has been developed and recently utilized for LGIB hemostasis. The aim of the current study was to assess the efficacy and safety of UI-EWD as a rescue therapy for the treatment of refractory LGIB. In this study, a total of 59 consecutive patients with LGIB who experienced initial hemostasis failure with conventional endoscopic therapy were enrolled into this multicenter single-arm study. These patients subsequently underwent UI-EWD application for the refractory LGIB hemostasis. We evaluated the success rate of hemostasis, re-bleeding rate within 30 d, and adverse events related to UI-EWD. UI-EWD was successfully administered to the bleeding sites in all enrolled refractory bleeding patients. Hemostasis was achieved in the entirety of the 59 patients (100%). The cumulative re-bleeding rate within 30 d was 8.5% (5/59). There were no UI-EWD-related adverse events, such as perforation nor embolism. Based on our results, the utilization of UI-EWD demonstrated a remarkable success rate in achieving hemostasis for refractory LGIB, while also exhibiting promising outcomes in reducing the re-bleeding rate within a 30-day period. Particularly, UI-EWD exhibits a favorable safety profile across all segments of the colon in cases of refractory LGIB."

This is a retrospective study of patients who underwent surgical intervention for HHT-associated epistaxis management from 01/2010-02/2024. Patients undergoing sclerotherapy with intralesional 3% sodium tetradecyl sulfate were included in the sclerotherapy group and others undergoing conventional non-sclerotherapy-based procedures in the non-sclerotherapy group. Outcomes like breakthrough epistaxis, emergency visits, intra-op blood loss, blood transfusions, and procedure complications in the 3-month perioperative period were compared. Twenty-three patients who underwent 74 intranasal procedures were identified. In the sclerotherapy group, 17 patients underwent 47 procedures. In the non-sclerotherapy group, 10 patients underwent 27 procedures. Till the 3rd post-treatment month, fewer breakthrough epistaxis episodes were observed after sclerotherapy procedures (13/47) vs. non-sclerotherapy procedures (14/27); (p = 0.037). Intraoperative blood loss was significantly lower during sclerotherapy (median: 10 ml) vs. non-sclerotherapy procedures (median: 50 ml); p < 0.001. The time interval between successive procedures was not significantly different in the sclerotherapy (median 6.5 months) vs. the non-sclerotherapy group (median 3.5 months); p = 0.13. Nasal crusting was the most common complication in the sclerotherapy group (36.9%). Two patients in each group had new onset septal perforation, none of the patients had vision loss or cerebrovascular accident. One emergency department visit was reported in the sclerotherapy group vs. 7 (in 3 patients) in the non-sclerotherapy group. Compared to non-sclerotherapy treatments, intralesional sclerotherapy for epistaxis in HHT is more effective in decreasing breakthrough epistaxis, and has lower intraoperative blood loss."

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is often associated with adenocarcinoma, but its significant elevation in NEC cases is unusual. A 69-year-old man was admitted to our hospital in January 2016 due to syncope induced by anemia. The patient had a hemoglobin level of 8.0 g/dL and an ileocecal mass causing small bowel obstruction on computed tomography. His CEA level was markedly elevated at 3625.4 ng/mL. A colonoscopy revealed a neoplastic lesion in the terminal ileum, leading to an emergency ileocecal resection. Pathology confirmed a NEC, positive for synaptophysin and CEA, with a Ki-67 index of 30%. The patient was diagnosed with stage IIIb NEC (pT3N2M0). A postoperative increase in CEA to 4124.6 ng/mL and metastases in the right lung and multiple lymph nodes were detected. Initial chemotherapy with irinotecan, cisplatin (IP), and octreotide acetate proved ineffective. Subsequent octreoscans showed disease progression. Switching to everolimus as second-line therapy temporarily decreased CEA levels and tumor size, but the disease progressed with cervical lymph node involvement. The patient underwent palliative radiotherapy but succumbed to disease progression in May 2018, with a final CEA level of 36,643 ng/mL. Necropsy of the cervical lymph nodes was consistent with the original surgical findings. This case highlights the aggressive nature and challenging management of NEC with significantly elevated CEA levels."

A total of 121 patients were diagnosed with acute appendicitis during the study period (October 2021 to April 2023). Forty-five children (38%) met criteria for the NOMA-C protocol, and 11 patients/families chose appendectomy. Of the 34 patients who pursued nonoperative management, 14 patients were admitted to the hospital and 20 patients were discharged from the ED. Total time in the ED/hospital was significantly shorter for patients discharged from the ED (7 hours versus 23 hours; p<0.001). At one year follow up only 4 (12%) had undergone appendectomy. There were no adverse events for patients who underwent nonoperative management. A protocol offering non-operative management of appendicitis with an option for outpatient management was feasible and safe. Outpatient management was associated with shorter ED/hospital stays than those admitted. Future studies should evaluate whether this protocol can be adopted by EDs without pediatric surgery services to avoid the need for transfer."

    "abstract": "A large Argentine tegu (Salvator merianae) presented with anorexia. Initial radiographs revealed a metallic foreign body in the stomach. The tegu vomited and became inactive two days later. A follow-up radiograph revealed the persistence of the foreign body in the same region. The foreign body was identified as a cluster of multiple magnets resembling neodymium magnets reported missing by the owner. An emergent laparotomy was performed due to gastrointestinal perforations caused by the multiple magnets. The surgical intervention revealed perforations in the walls of the stomach and small intestine and progressing acute peritonitis. Three magnets were extracted from the abdominal cavity and the tegu showed recovery. At 200 days postoperatively, the tegu continued to demonstrate good appetite and energy levels."

    "title": "ATEC23 Challenge: Automated prediction of treatment effectiveness in ovarian cancer using histopathological images.",
    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer, predominantly epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), is a global health concern due to its high mortality rate. Despite the progress made during the last two decades in the surgery and chemotherapy of ovarian cancer, more than 70% of advanced patients are with recurrent cancer and disease. Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, which blocks VEGF signaling in cancer, inhibits angiogenesis and causes tumor shrinkage, and has been recently approved by the FDA as a monotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer in combination with chemotherapy. Unfortunately, Bevacizumab may also induce harmful adverse effects, such as hypertension, bleeding, arterial thromboembolism, poor wound healing and gastrointestinal perforation. Given the expensive cost and unwanted toxicities, there is an urgent need for predictive methods to identify who could benefit from bevacizumab. Of the 18 (approved) requests from 5 countries, 6 teams using 284 whole section WSIs for training to develop fully automated systems submitted their predictions on a test set of 180 tissue core images, with the corresponding ground truth labels kept private. This paper summarizes the 5 qualified methods successfully submitted to the international challenge of automated prediction of treatment effectiveness in ovarian cancer using the histopathologic images (ATEC23) held at the 26th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) in 2023 and evaluates the methods in comparison with 5 state of the art deep learning approaches. This study further assesses the effectiveness of the presented prediction models as indicators for patient selection utilizing both Cox proportional hazards analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. A robust and cost-effective deep learning pipeline for digital histopathology tasks has become a necessity within the context of the medical community. This challenge highlights the limitations of current MIL methods, particularly within the context of prognosis-based classification tasks, and the importance of DCNNs like inception that has nonlinear convolutional modules at various resolutions to facilitate processing the data in multiple resolutions, which is a key feature required for pathology related prediction tasks. This further suggests the use of feature reuse at various scales to improve models for future research directions. In particular, this paper releases the labels of the testing set and provides applications for future research directions in precision oncology to predict ovarian cancer treatment effectiveness and facilitate patient selection via histopathological images."

    "abstract": "Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a potentially fatal abdominal emergency. The estimation of the severity of AMI is of great importance since changes in disease severity may have different impacts on the treatment options. This study aims to define laboratory and radiological parameters that can successfully predict the severity of AMI. Data from 100 patients who were treated conservatively and underwent an operation with a diagnosis of AMI between the years 2010 and 2019 were reviewed. The patients were divided into 3 groups as those treated with a conservative approach (group 1), those with partial intestinal ischemia (group 2), and those with complete intestinal ischemia (group 3) according to the pathology results. Laboratory findings of the patients were recorded and matched with radiological findings. The white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil (NEUT) count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and C-reactive protein/albumin ratios were the considered distinctive parameters for distinguishing the third group from the first group. However, the same result cannot be applied to the first and the second groups since only the WBC and NEUT counts showed distinctive performance. The measurement of neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, WBC, NEUT, and albumin levels can be used to predict the severity of AMI. We believe that evaluating these laboratory parameters will greatly prevent possible morbidity and mortality in the patient. Also, we were able to observe that the parameters used in predicting AMI severity can be verified with rapid and low-cost radiological imaging techniques."

    "abstract": "Although various complications associated with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms have been reported, including acute pancreatitis, duct perforation, and fistula formation, spontaneous bleeding, especially life-threatening bleeding, is infrequent. In this case, emergency pancreatic resection might be one of the therapeutic options, which is associated with poor postoperative outcomes. An 87-year-old woman presented to our hospital with severe anemia (hemoglobin, 4.5 g/dl). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a large cystic lesion in the pancreatic head measuring 15 cm, with some solid components and an adjacent hematoma, suggestive of intra-cystic hemorrhage of the intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. The patient was hemodynamically unstable and had hypotension. After transcatheter arterial embolization, the patient became hemodynamically stable. Subsequently, an elective pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was successfully performed. Preoperative embolization was effective for subsequent elective pancreaticoduodenectomy in patients with severe intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm bleeding."

    "abstract": "An endoscopic intragastric balloon (IGB) placement is one of the minimally invasive methods of obesity treatment. One of the rare serious complications is mechanical bowel obstruction requiring operative management. We report a case of a male patient with small bowel obstruction due to IGB migration and the literature review of complications during IGB treatment. Detailed Case Description: A patient with a BMI of 28 kg/m2 was admitted to the hospital with spontaneous deflation of an IGB. Due to the suspected location of IGB in the ileum laparoscopy was performed. The enterotomy was performed and the IGB removed. The procedure and the postoperative period were uneventful. Spontaneous IGB ruptures are reported in the literature with a frequency ranging from 0.6 to 23%. The majority of deflated devices are spontaneously excreted with the stool with no abdominal symptoms. Only 0.38% of IGBs cause mechanical bowel obstruction of requiring surgical management. Based on our own experience and literature review, we propose the diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm. Complications after IGB placement can range from mild to severe, that is why it is so important to make an early diagnosis based on the emerging symptoms and to implement prompt management to reduce or avoid serious complications. Any patient reporting disturbing symptoms occurring over a pro- longed period of time requires hospitalization and careful observation for the occurrence of gastrointestinal obstruction. The ideal option is hospitalization in the center which implemented the IGB and start with the algorithm we proposed."

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected healthcare systems worldwide, with mandatory quarantine and isolation measures being implemented to curb the spread of the virus. These measures have potentially led to delayed or complicated presentations of non-COVID-19 cases, including pediatric surgical cases. This study aims to evaluate pediatric surgical admission patterns, analyze the incidence of surgical diagnoses, and assess the severity of presentation during the COVID-19 period compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. This retrospective observational study was conducted at a university hospital in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia to assess the effect of the pandemic on pediatric surgery admissions patterns and severity of presentation during the COVID-19 period (March 2, 2020, to March 1, 2022) and pre-COVID-19 period (March 1, 2018, to March 1, 2020). Of the 903 pediatric surgical admissions, 366 (40.5%) presented during the COVID-19 period. The admission rate per month decreased by 6.9 during COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19 (mean [SD]: 21.5 [9.3] vs. 14.6 [8.2], p = 0.01). The most common admission diagnoses were appendicitis (17.5%) and inguinal hernia (15.8%). There was a 15% increase in the percentage of emergency admissions (54.4% vs. 47.3%, p = 0.037) during COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19. Of note, the percentage of patients admitted with acute appendicitis increased by 35.9% (20.8% vs. 15.3%, p = 0.03). Furthermore, the emergency admissions for patients with inguinal hernia doubled (26.6% vs. 12.7%, p = 0.035). No significant difference in ICU admissions, hospital length of stay, and routine discharge were observed. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic correlated with a significant decrease in overall admissions and an increase in emergency admissions, including those for appendicitis and inguinal hernia. The increase in complicated conditions was not significant. There was no significant difference in ICU admissions and hospital length of stay. Future studies involving multiple centers are necessary to validate these findings."

    "abstract": "The intragastric balloon is a medical device inserted into the stomach endoscopically and filled with either air or more commonly, saline. Widely utilised since the 1980s, numerous studies have affirmed its safety and effectiveness as a temporary treatment for weight loss. Despite this, there have been reports of rare but severe complications associated with its usage. We report the case of a 33-year-old female presented with two-day history of epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting. This occurred after having a gastric balloon placed endoscopically two months earlier. A contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan revealed a partially deflated and migrated intragastric balloon in the proximal jejunum, causing intestinal obstruction without any signs of bowel perforation. The diagnosis was established as intestinal obstruction due to the migrated intragastric balloon. An emergency endoscopic procedure was undertaken, successfully removing the balloon thus highlighting a unique attempt to endoscopically retrieve a migrated intragastric balloon from the jejunum. The efficacy of an intragastric balloon in reducing weight in a short time is gaining more popularity. The more common it becomes the more we must be vigilant about its complications. We advise regular follow-up of patients and emphasise patient education of possible signs and symptoms of intragastric balloon migration, which will avoid serious complications. Endoscopic removal from the jejunum: Learn the procedure for endoscopic removal of a migrated gastric balloon from the jejunum, recognising it is possible without signs of perforation or leakage. Additionally, understand the importance of performing this procedure with surgical backup in a theatre to address any potential complications, such as perforation, during or after the procedure.The role of CT scans: Understand the crucial role of CT scans in diagnosing migrated gastric balloons or perforations related to gastric balloon procedures.Recognising and responding to balloon deflation: Identify signs of a deflated gastric balloon, such as methylene blue in the urine, and understand associated symptoms such as reduction in stomach fullness."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia (ALI) due to arterial thromboembolic occlusion is a critical emergency in vascular medicine, requiring attention for rapid diagnosis and intervention, to prevent limb loss and major amputation, which is associated with patient disability in the long term. Traditionally, surgical embolectomy has been used for the treatment of ALI. Endovascular treatment of ALI traditionally involved catheter-directed thrombolysis. This option, however, poses some limitations, including an increased risk for access site and systemic bleeding complications, especially in patients with high bleeding risk. Therefore, in the last decades, several devices have been developed and tested for the mechanical endovascular treatment of ALI. Such devices involve either rotational thrombectomy or continuous thrombus aspiration. While rotational thrombectomy is limited in rather large arteries due to the risk of dissection and perforation in arteries <3 mm, continuous thrombus aspiration can be applied in smaller vessels and tortuous anatomies. In our case series we present a minimal-invasive endovascular approach for the treatment of two patients with ALI due to thrombotic occlusion of tortious and small diameter arteries. Minimal-invasive mechanical thrombectomy using the Penumbra Aspiration System emerged as a successful alternative to surgical embolectomy, enabling prompt treatment and with a short hospital stay for both patients. Our article therefore highlights the use of continuous thrombus aspiration in small diameter vessels and tortuous anatomies, which may represent a contraindication for the use of rotational thrombectomy. In addition, this technique may be applied even in patients with higher bleeding risk since additional lysis is not necessary in patients, where complete thrombus removal can be achieved by this device."

Such complications of portal hypertension as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, ascites, hepatorenal sуndrome, variceal bleeding caused by sinistral portal hypertension are considered. The effectiveness of interventional treatment methods and laparoscopic surgical interventions has been demonstrated. Conclusions: Diagnosis and treatment of patients with complicated portal hypertension requires a multidisciplinary approach, which is due to the diverse pathophysiological process of portal hypertension. The possibilities of providing emergency care to this category of patients depend on the level of medical training of the staff, the possibilities of medical and technical support in the provision of interventional care, the ineffectiveness of which necessitates surgical treatment using minimally invasive technologies."

    "title": "Evaluation of Multidetector Computed Tomography in the Diagnosis of Intestinal Obstruction.",
    "abstract": "Background Acute intestinal obstruction is a commonly encountered surgical emergency that is prevalent worldwide and has substantial morbidity and fatality rates. Therefore, swift and precise diagnosis is essential. While mortality rates in urban areas have declined due to timely medical intervention following early detection, the situation contrasts starkly in rural areas. Delays in presentations often lead to complications because of hesitancy toward surgery, economic challenges, and limited access to healthcare information. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate how well multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) can help determine the site, cause, and level of intestinal obstruction compared to what the surgeons confirmed intraoperatively. Methodology A prospective study involving 101 patients was conducted at a tertiary care center in western Maharashtra from July 2022 to July 2024. The emergency department referred patients with clinical symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, abdominal distension, abdominal pain, inability to pass flatus, constipation, or diarrhea, which are commonly seen with intestinal obstruction. The study involved all patients who underwent a contrast-enhanced MDCT scan using both intravenous and oral contrast agents. We selected patients from both genders, regardless of their age; however, considerations were taken to include characteristics convenient and relevant to the study. Patients with abnormal serum creatinine levels or allergies to contrast were excluded from the study. We conducted CT examinations, noting findings such as the transition point between the dilated and collapsed loops, mesenteric fat stranding, and intestinal dilatation. An experienced radiologist made the final report, and the operating surgeons' notes on laparoscopy or open surgery for the same patient were reviewed to understand the operative findings. Results MDCT scans had high diagnostic accuracy for small and large bowel obstruction. Of the 101 patients, the mean age was 43.7 years. There were 70 (69.30%) males and 31 (30.69%) females. Sensitivity was 100%, specificity was 98.1%, positive predictive value was 83.7%, and negative predictive value was 100%. Conclusions MDCT demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing and determining the underlying cause of intestinal obstruction. It identified the location of the obstruction and discerned whether it originated from intrinsic, extrinsic, or intraluminal factors."

    "abstract": "Obturator hernia is a rare condition, often presenting with non-specific symptoms, such as thigh pain, groin pain, nausea, or vomiting. Obturator hernias are most common in thin, elderly women. Oftentimes, they are diagnosed late in the disease course resulting in complications and high morbidity and mortality. We present the case of a 75-year-old female who presented with right thigh pain with no other symptoms. After computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen/pelvis, the patient was found to have an incarcerated obturator hernia complicated by a small bowel obstruction, ultimately requiring urgent surgical intervention. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Given the very general symptoms associated with the condition, the diagnosis of obturator hernia can easily be missed, leading to a delayed diagnosis, more complications, and a higher morbidity and mortality rate. Due to the risk associated with a delayed diagnosis, it is important for emergency physicians to maintain a high clinical suspicion for the diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Volvulus of the large bowel is a pathological condition characterized by the twisting of the colon around itself, resulting in obstruction and potentially severe complications such as bowel ischemia and necrosis. The objective of this case report is to highlight the importance of considering volvulus as a differential diagnosis in patients with a history of colonic surgeries, particularly when presenting with symptoms indicative of bowel obstruction. The case was a 55 years old male patient who underwent Hartman procedure three years back for an indication of gangrenous sigmoid volvulus. Three months later the colostomy was reversed and descending colo-rectal end-to-end anastomosis was performed. He currently presented to the emergency department with a one day history of abdominal distension which was progressive and associated with colicky persistent abdominal pain. Exploratory laparotomy was done which showed the descending colon was massively dilated and twisted 360 degree in the counterclockwise direction. The patient was discharged from the ward after one week stay. Despite of the fact that volvulus is the third most common cause of bowel obstruction, consecutive bowel obstruction secondary to volvulus at a separate time and site is an extremely rare phenomenon. A metachronous colonic volvulus is an extremely rare clinical entity. In a patient who presents with bowel obstruction with a history of prior sigmoid colectomy. it is important to consider metachronous volvulus as differential diagnosis specially in patients with significant risk factors or residing in a geographic area known with high rates of volvulus."

The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility, efficacy and safety of learning ESD in an untutored approach in a prevalence-based setting within New Zealand. Over a 4-year period, 80 ESD procedures were performed at a single tertiary centre within New Zealand. We retrospectively reviewed basic demographics of the patients, along with successful en bloc resection rates, dissection speeds, histological diagnoses (including margin assessments) and complications. We captured 80 procedures. Within this database we achieved an en bloc resection of 88.7% (71 out of 80 cases) and an R0 resection of 72.5% (58 out of 80 cases). The international benchmark for dissection speed of 9cm2/h was achieved within the first block of 20 cases and was maintained throughout. There was a perforation rate of 6.25% (five patients), with one patient (1.25%) requiring emergency surgery for a rectal perforation. Our study shows it is feasible and safe to learn ESD within a low-volume tertiary centre within New Zealand via a prevalence-based approached. The majority of patients were able to have en bloc resection and a R0 resection. Our intent is that this data be used to help design a more formalised training process for learning ESD within a New Zealand setting."

Intestinal ultrasound is performed at our centre finding a long ileal stenosis, 33 cm, thickened wall 5.6mm, destructuring of the layer pattern, hyperemia (modified Limberg score 3), ileoileal fistula with no collection associated, and a prestenotic dilation of 40 mm. The dental foreign body is found, non-impacted, in the prestenotic dilated loop. Even though an initial course of intraneous steroids is ordered, due to previous medical history of a persistent active Crohn's disease with loss of response to three advanced therapies, as well as the very low probability of progression of the foreign body along with the risk of permanent impaction or perforation, surgery is indicated.

    "abstract": "Toxic megacolon (TM) is a severe condition characterized by acute colonic dilation, with specific radiological and clinical signs. The multifactorial etiology of TM is primarily associated with inflammatory bowel disease and infections. However, TM remains a challenging complication due to its potential for rapid progression to life-threatening conditions. This report describes a rare case of TM in a 25-year-old male with a history of recurrent constipation and chronic cocaine consumption. Examination and imaging indicated acute intestinal obstruction with dilated colon segments and fecal impaction, necessitating an urgent laparotomy. Surgery revealed pan-colonic dilatation and sigmoid perforations, leading to a total colectomy and ileostomy. Chronic constipation, often perceived as benign, can escalate into a critical situation, possibly exacerbated by cocaine-induced muscle weakness and hypoxia. Evidence suggests that cocaine negatively affects the intestinal mucosa, potentially leading to ischemia. Chronic factors, including the use of enemas, may have contributed to megacolon development and perforation. Overall, this report underscores the critical elements of diagnosis and the importance of patients' medical history, particularly those with unusual risk profiles. In addition, it highlights the need for further research to fully understand the implications of these cases."

This study involved 9762 adolescents and young adults discharged from their first psychiatric admission and matched 1:1 with 9762 individuals discharged following a diagnosis of appendicitis on the basis of birth year and sex by using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Both stratified (model 1) and standard (model 2) Cox regression analyses were conducted to assess variations in all-cause and suicide mortality between the groups. Over the 15-year follow-up period, the adolescents and young adults discharged from their first psychiatric admission exhibited an approximately 3-fold increased risk of death from any cause (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.97 in model 1, 2.83 in model 2) and an approximately ten times higher risk of suicide (11.13 in model 1, 9.23 in model 2) compared with those discharged with a diagnosis of appendicitis. Those discharged with alcohol use disorder or major depressive disorder exhibited higher hazard ratios for both all-cause and suicide compared with the reference group. The findings reveal a considerable risk of all-cause and suicide mortality in adolescents and young adults following discharge from their first psychiatric admission.

An 81-year-old woman receiving both heparin and dabigatran was scheduled for an emergency surgical repair of iatrogenic atrial septal perforation. Although ACT was prolonged to 419 s, we performed TEG to distinguish anticoagulation by dabigatran from heparin comparing R in CK and CHK. As the results of TEG indicated residual effect of dabigatran, we reversed dabigatran by idarucizumab and then dosed 200 U/kg of heparin to achieve adequate anticoagulation for CPB by heparin. TEG could help physicians to determine need for idarucizumab and also an adequate dose of heparin to establish appropriate anticoagulation for CPB."

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between type of presentation (emergency/elective) and oncological outcome. Clinicopathological data of patients who underwent bowel resection and were treated due to siNET at the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany were analyzed retrospectively. A total of 165 patients underwent bowel resection for siNET. Of these, 22.4% (n = 37) were emergency and 77.6% (n = 128) were elective procedures. A preoperative known diagnosis was less common in patients with emergency surgery (48.6% vs 85.2%; p < 0.001) and complete resections of all tumor manifestations were performed less often (32.4% vs 50.8%; p = 0.049), while more completion operations had to be performed (24.3% vs 11.1%; p = 0.049).

Thionamides are typically administered orally, with the intent of preventing further thyroid hormone synthesis; however, in the literature, there are instances whereby oral access cannot be obtained, and alternative routes of administration are required. We present a case of a patient who presented with a thyroid storm due to lack of adherence to methimazole. During admission, he was found to have significant abdominal pain and ultimately a duodenal perforation requiring strict nil-per-os (NPO) status, due to which he was unable to receive oral thionamides. Due to the lack of availability of intravenous formulations of thionamides in the United States, this patient was treated with an enema compound of propylthiouracil for a total of five per rectum (PR) doses. He would later develop hepatocellular injury, requiring discontinuation and eventual transition to oral methimazole. The literature pertaining to alternative-route thionamide administration is scant, and therefore this case report and literature review is written to provide an up-to-date review and further educate all levels of clinicians about this infrequent (but emergent) situation. Thyroid storm is a clinical diagnosis for which urgent recognition is required to prevent untoward mortality. Treatment for thyroid storm requires prompt administration of thionamides, iodine, corticosteroids, and beta-blockers. In extreme circumstances, treatment considerations include plasmapheresis and thyroidectomy. Infrequently, patients with a thyroid storm may not be able to tolerate oral medications, for which alternative routes of access are required. Currently, available alternatives include intravenous methimazole (in Europe and Japan), as well as both enema and suppository preparations of propylthiouracil and methimazole."

    "abstract": "To examine the potential negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on short-term postoperative outcomes of emergency surgery for gastroduodenal perforation in Japan. A total of 7973 cases of gastroduodenal perforation from 2019 to 2021 were retrieved from the National Clinical Database (NCD), which includes >95% of surgical cases in Japan. Data were analyzed nationally and in subgroups for subjects in areas with high infection levels (HILs). Postoperative 30-d mortality, surgical mortality, and complications (Clavien-Dindo (CD) grade ≥3) were examined. Months were considered to have significantly high or low mortality or complication rates, if the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the standardized mortality (morbidity) ratio (SMR) does not contain 1. Nationally, data from 2019 vs 2020 and 2021 showed 30-d mortality of 175 (6.7%) vs 398 (7.4%), surgical mortality of 250 (9.5%) vs 537 (10.1%), and complications (CD ≥3) of 558 (21.2%) vs 1163 (21.8%). Among these data, the only significantly high SMR was found for complications in July 2020 (1.36 [95% CI: 1.001-1.80]). In areas with HILs, data from 2019 vs 2020 and 2021 indicated 30-d mortality of 91 (6.3%) vs 215 (7.3%), surgical mortality of 135 (9.4%) vs 294 (10.0%), and complications (CD ≥3) of 304 (21.1%) vs (23.1%). In these data, no month had a significantly high SMR. The COVID-19 pandemic had few negative effects on outcomes after surgery for gastroduodenal perforation. These findings suggest that the emergency system for gastroduodenal perforation in Japan was generally maintained during the pandemic."

    "abstract": "In modern medical practice, procedures that involve the use of catheters are common. These procedures can range from percutaneous coronary and peripheral vascular interventions to using catheters to drain fluid. However, complications associated with catheter usage can arise, and the most severe one is the puncture of a vital organ due to catheter misplacement. In this case, we present a rare complication related to the use of a pigtail catheter, which caused perforation of the left ventricular free wall. The patient presented with an electrocardiogram showing ST segment elevation in the anterior wall, indicative of a heart attack. The patient underwent coronary angiography, which showed that the coronary arteries were unblocked. However, during the procedure, the medical team suspected that the pigtail catheter was stuck in the left ventricle chamber, based on the use of fluoroscopy. This suspicion was later confirmed using computer tomography. To address the issue, the patient underwent an emergent cardiorrhaphy, which was performed immediately. Fortunately, the patient survived the complication."

    "abstract": "Children are frequently reported as cases of foreign body ingestion, with fishbone ingestion being particularly prevalent in communities where fish consumption is common. Although many instances of foreign body ingestion resolve spontaneously, the ingestion of sharp objects like fishbones poses a greater risk of morbidity and mortality due to their propensity for causing complications. Furthermore, incidents of foreign body ingestion often present with nonspecific symptoms or may go unnoticed, potentially leading to misdiagnosis and complicating the clinical course. We present a case of a 2-year-old boy initially misdiagnosed with constipation and treated with laxatives due to intermittent progressive abdominal pain. Subsequently, he presented to the emergency department where radiological and laboratory investigations revealed signs of inflammation and localized abdominal fluid collection containing a linear hyperdense object, indicating complicated foreign body ingestion with perforation. Urgent laparotomy revealed an omental abscess, which was excised, and the perforation site was repaired with sutures. This case underscores the risk of misdiagnosis and the importance of timely recognition and management. It also emphasizes the critical role of imaging, particularly computed tomography, in accurate diagnosis and differentiation from other common conditions."

Abdominal imaging typically reveals a massively dilated colon with no evident obstructive lesion. Initial management is conservative and includes supportive measures such as bowel rest and decompression, and may include medications to enhance colonic motility. In severe cases, endoscopic or surgical intervention to relieve symptoms and prevent complications such as bowel ischemia or perforation may be necessary.

This study also aimed to report clinical outcome following cholecystectomy and evaluate for associations with survival. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed (2014 to 2021) for dogs undergoing cholecystectomy and duodenal biopsy procedures for gallbladder mucocele. Signalment, bloodwork, abdominal ultrasound findings, surgical details, histology results and outcomes were reported. Surgeries were considered elective or emergent based on each dog's clinical presentation. Enteritis was categorised based on cell type and severity. Inflammation and clinical outcome were statistically evaluated. Seventy-one dogs met the study criteria. Enteritis was present in 85.9% (61/71) of cases with the majority being lymphoplasmacytic (53.5%). Twelve dogs (16.9%) underwent gastrointestinal biopsies from multiple sites, which revealed the same enteritis type at each location. A total of 87.3% (n = 62) dogs survived, including 90.4% elective and 86% emergent cases. No significant differences in enteritis severity or patient survival were found between elective and emergent cases. Septic peritonitis was diagnosed in two dogs (2.82%). Mortality was significantly associated with leukocytosis, with nonsurviving dogs having a mean WBC count of 27.6 G/L (95% confidence interval: 10.6 to 21.5). Enteritis is present in a majority of dogs with gallbladder mucocele, especially mild to moderate with lymphoplasmacytic cell type. Obtaining a duodenal biopsy had minimal impact on patient outcome. Compared to previous studies, improved survival in emergent cases was noted. Further studies with long-term follow-up are needed to determine if enteropathy-related signs persist after cholecystectomy."

To present our experience using point of care ultrasound (POCUS) in a pediatric emergency medicine training program without POCUS fellowship-trained staff, and to demonstrate that POCUS of the appendix is feasible outside the context for POCUS fellowship training. We identified children diagnosed with appendicitis or periappendiceal abscess from June 2016 to June 2024. Variables reviewed include details of PED visit such as presenting symptoms, laboratory and imaging results, and PED treatment, as well as surgical report and pathology result. We evaluated the frequency and performance characteristics of POCUS over the study period. 999 children were diagnosed with appendicitis. POCUS was performed in 360 of 845 cases (43%) of histology-confirmed appendicitis and in 19 of 69 cases (28%) in which histology was negative for appendicitis. Both the number of POCUS examinations for appendicitis and the percentage of examinations correctly identifying appendicitis steadily increased over the study period. Accuracy was highest in the 5-10-year age range and lowest for females from 10 to 15 years. In 96% of cases with a pathology result of appendicitis and a positive POCUS examination, POCUS correctly identified appendicitis. However, only 6 of 19 POCUS examinations in children without appendicitis on histology found no appendicitis. Performance of POCUS for appendicitis was significantly associated with increased opioid administration and a 20-min mean decrease in length of pediatric emergency department stay. POCUS for appendicitis within the context of PEM fellowship training is feasible and associated with decreased length of stay."

    "abstract": "Gallbladder perforation (GBP) is a rare but life-threatening complication of acute cholecystitis. Despite advancements in imaging technology and biochemical analysis, perforations are still diagnosed intraoperatively in some cases. This situation has revealed the need for new markers in the diagnosis of perforation. In this study, we aimed to analyze the role of biomarkers in the diagnosis of perforated cholecystitis cases. In this retrospective study, blood samples (white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin, platelet count, C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, CRP/albumin ratio (CAR), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), urea, creatinine, glucose, amylase, lipase, aspartate ami-notransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), total bilirubin, direct bilirubin) were analyzed in patients who were diagnosed with acute cholecystitis in the emergency department. One hundred seventy patients were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of gallbladder perforation. Sixty-three (37.1%) patients had perforation. Transition from laparoscopy to open operation, intensive care unit admission, length of hospital stay, and mortality were higher in the perforated group compared to the non-perforated group. When we analyzed the patients according to laboratory findings, there was a difference in WBC, NLR, CRP, albumin, and CAR parameters in the perforation group. In regression analysis, CRP and CAR performed better. Our study showed that CRP and CAR may be diagnostic biomarkers with low specificity and sensitivity in predicting GBP in patients with acute cholecystitis. This marker is a low-cost and easily accessible parameter that may help clinicians make an early diagnosis and plan appropriate treatment for this condition with high morbidity and mortality."

A prompt and accurate diagnosis is essential to prevent complications such as perforation and peritonitis. To investigate the predictive value of the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) combined with the pediatric appendicitis score (PAS) for the assessment of disease severity and surgical outcomes in children aged 5 years and older with appendicitis. Clinical data of 104 children diagnosed with acute appendicitis were analyzed. The participants were categorized into the acute appendicitis group and chronic appendicitis group based on disease presentation and further stratified into the good prognosis group and poor prognosis group based on prognosis. The SII and PAS were measured, and a joint model using the combined SII and PAS was constructed to predict disease severity and surgical outcomes. Significant differences were observed in the SII and PAS parameters between the acute appendicitis group and chronic appendicitis group. Correlation analysis showed associations among the SII, PAS, and disease severity, with the combined SII and PAS model demonstrating significant predictive value for assessing disease severity [aera under the curve (AUC) = 0.914] and predicting surgical outcomes (AUC = 0.857) in children aged 5 years and older with appendicitis. The study findings support the potential of integrating the SII with the PAS for assessing disease severity and predicting surgical outcomes in pediatric appendicitis, indicating the clinical utility of the combined SII and PAS model in guiding clinical decision-making and optimizing surgical management strategies for pediatric patients with appendicitis."

Although the efficacy of conservative treatment for uncomplicated appendicitis is known, its efficacy for complicated appendicitis remains unknown, so are risk factors for the conservative treatment of appendicitis. In our institution, conservative treatment has long been the first choice for most appendicitis cases, except for perforation. Therefore, this novel study investigated the outcomes of conservative treatment for uncomplicated and complicated acute appendicitis and the risk factors associated with conservative treatment. To investigate the indication of conservative treatment by antibiotics for uncomplicated and complicated acute appendicitis. We investigated 270 patients who received conservative treatment for acute appendicitis at the Nishitokyo Central General Hospital, between April 2011 and February 2022. Twenty-eight (10.3%) patients were resistant to conservative treatment and underwent surgery. We retrospectively investigated the outcomes of conservative treatment for appendicitis and the risk factors for resistance to conservative treatment using the receiver operating characteristic curves and Cox hazard model. Two hundred and forty-two (89.7%) patients improved with conservative treatment. The significant and independent predictors of resistance to conservative treatment were body temperature ≥ 37.3 °C, appendicolith and Douglas sinus fluid visible on computed tomography (CT). The rate of resistance to conservative treatment was 66.7% (6/9) for patients with the above three factors, 22.9% (8/35) for patients with two factors (appendicolith and body temperature ≥ 37.3 °C), 16.7% (2/12) for patients with two factors (Douglas sinus fluid and appendicolith) and 11.1% (1/9) for patients with two factors (Douglas sinus fluid and body temperature ≥ 37.3 °C). A temperature ≥ 37.3 °C, appendicolith and Douglas sinus fluid on CT might be clinical risk factors of resistance to conservative treatment for acute appendicitis."

The incidence of spontaneous gastric perforation in neonates is 1:2900 live births, with high mortality and morbidity rates. The primary treatment is surgical debridement and repair of the perforation, which has a high incidence of anastomotic leakage. At present, there is a plethora of studies investigating the efficacy of human dried amniotic membrane (H-DAM) technology in promoting wound healing. Consequently, researchers sought to ascertain whether there were differences in the number of adhesion and abscess classifications for the macroscopic evaluation of gastric perforation repair with HDAM as a biomaterial in New Zealand white rabbits. A total of 30 male New Zealand rabbits underwent laparotomy and gastric perforation. These animals were then divided into three groups, with each group comprising 10 rabbits. Group 1 underwent primary repair, group 2 underwent omental patch repair, and group 3 underwent H-DAM patch repair. The rabbits were euthanised on the 7th day and the adhesion score and abscess classification were evaluated. A total of 30 samples of rabbits were homogeneous. On macroscopic evaluation, it was found that the H-DAM had the lowest mean adhesion score and the lowest incidence of abscess formation compared to all other groups. It can be concluded that the utilisation of HDAM as a biomaterial patch in the treatment of gastric perforation in the rabbit model did not result in any instances of leakage, adhesion or infection."

    "abstract": "Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is commonly performed to alleviate hip pain and restore function. While generally safe, complications such as prosthesis migration can occur. Intrapelvic migration of hip prostheses, leading to bowel perforation and fistula formation, is a rare but severe complication requiring prompt diagnosis and management. This case report, presented in line with the SCARE criteria, highlights a case of caecal perforation due to hip prosthesis migration. A 78-year-old female with a history of right THA presented with severe hip pain, loss of function, and a persistent fistula exuding fecaloid fluid. Examination revealed fever, rigidity, and limited hip motion. CT scans showed intrapelvic protrusion of the prosthetic components and a colo-cutaneous fistula. Emergency laparotomy revealed caecal perforation by a screw from the acetabular component, necessitating resection of the perforated caecum. A subsequent surgery addressed the hip prosthesis. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged on day 7. Prosthesis migration into the pelvis is a serious complication of THA. Risk factors include implant loosening, acetabular bone loss, surgical technique issues, and patient factors like obesity and osteoporosis. Diagnosis relies on imaging studies. Management typically involves surgical removal of the migrated prosthesis and repair of the perforation, necessitating a multidisciplinary approach. Caecal perforation due to intrapelvic migration of a hip prosthesis is rare but potentially life-threatening. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate management are crucial. Further research is needed to better understand risk factors and prevention strategies."

To delineate the clinical manifestations of nasal foreign bodies associated with button batteries and to explore treatment approaches focused on minimizing the reliance on general anesthesia and surgical interventions. This study focuses on 176 cases of children who received treatment for nasal cavity button battery impactions. It encompasses various factors including age, gender, battery location, impaction duration, methods of extraction, and associated complications. The incidence of nasal button battery cases among nasal foreign body instances was 1.16%, with a majority being males (60.23%) aged 1-5 years (98.29%). Utilizing a specially designed nasal foreign body hook and following established treatment protocols enabled the successful outpatient management of the majority of cases. Only 12 cases (6.82%) necessitated removal under general anesthesia due to management challenges in an outpatient setting. Furthermore, our findings indicated no linear correlation between the duration of battery retention and the risk of nasal septal perforation, which was observed in 31 cases (17.61%). Nasal foreign bodies caused by button batteries in children demand urgent attention due to their potentially grave outcomes. Our research is directed towards enhancing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to bolster the success rates of outpatient removal, curtail the duration of foreign body retention, and diminish the reliance on general anesthesia."

Perforated MD can lead to serious complications. Timely use of advanced imaging and surgical assessment is essential for accurate diagnosis and management. Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is a gastrointestinal congenital anomaly that signifies a persistent remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct. While frequently asymptomatic, its complications vary widely, ranging from mild and painless to potentially life-threatening conditions. This is a case of a 4-year-old female patient with sudden abdominal pain and tenderness, with an elusive cause before surgery. The definitive diagnosis of a perforated MD was established during diagnostic laparoscopy due to worsening symptoms. Detecting MD and its potential complications requires a high degree of suspicion. Once recognized, prompt management is essential to prevent further complications. Although perforation is uncommon in MD, its symptoms can mimic acute appendicitis, confusing emergency settings. This article underscores the significance of diagnosing MD, despite its rarity, and emphasizes the necessity for swift treatment upon identification."

It is known that a positive culture result for SBP, which is a common reason for admission to the emergency department, is related to the severity and prognosis of the disease. However, as it is not possible to determine the culture result in the early stage of the disease, different methods are required to predict prognosis in the emergency department. This study was conducted to evaluate the success of the SII, SIRI, NLR and PLR in predicting culture results, intensive care needs and mortality in patients with SBP admitted to the emergency department. Materials and Methods: This study was a retrospective, observational study. Patients with SBP who applied to the emergency department were included in this study. Pregnant women, patients with a malignancy, patients with another infection and patients with liver failure were excluded from this study. Data were analyzed in terms of culture results, the need for intensive care and mortality development. Analyses were performed using SPSS version 26. Results are presented with a 95% confidence interval. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Participant data were analyzed using the independent samples t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test based on normality, and ROC analyses were conducted to assess test accuracies and determine cut-off values. Results: A total of 275 patients were included in this study. Although the culture results of 183 patients were positive, 92 were negative. The SII, NLR and PLR were found to be significantly higher in culture-positive patients (p < 0.001, p = 0.013 and p = 0.002, respectively). The SII and NLR were found to be significantly higher in patients with high mortality (p < 0.001 and p = 0.017, respectively). Conclusions: This study showed that the SII, NLR and PLR may be useful in predicting culture positivity and prognosis in SBP patients in the emergency department."

    "title": "Emergency Awake Laparotomy Using Neuraxial Anaesthesia: A Case Series and Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "Emergency laparotomy is a surgical procedure associated with significantly higher mortality rates compared to elective surgeries. Awake laparotomy under neuraxial anaesthesia has recently emerged as a promising approach in abdominal surgery to improve patient outcomes. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and potential benefits of using neuraxial anaesthesia as the primary anaesthetic technique in emergency laparotomies. We conducted a case series involving 16 patients who underwent emergency laparotomy for bowel ischemia, perforation, or occlusion. Neuraxial anaesthesia was employed as the main anaesthetic technique. We analysed patient demographics, clinical characteristics, intraoperative details, and postoperative outcomes. The primary outcome measures included the adequacy of postoperative pain control, the incidence of postoperative complications, and mortality rates. Among the 16 patients, adequate postoperative pain control was achieved, with only 2 patients requiring additional analgesia. Postoperative complications, including sepsis, wound dehiscence, and pneumonia, were observed in seven patients (44%). The observed mortality rate was relatively low at 6% (one patient). Notably, conversion to general anaesthesia was not necessary in any of the cases, and no early readmissions were reported. Our findings highlight the feasibility and potential benefits of using neuraxial anaesthesia in emergency laparotomies. The observed low mortality rate and the avoidance of conversion to general anaesthesia suggest that neuraxial anaesthesia may be a useful alternative in emergency settings. However, the occurrence of postoperative complications in 44% of patients indicates the need for cautious patient selection and close monitoring. Further research with larger sample sizes is warranted to fully elucidate the efficacy, safety, and potential impact of this technique on patient outcomes in emergency laparotomies."

    "abstract": "Campylobacter is a common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. This report presents a rare case of a 44-year-old female who developed a caecum perforation following an initial diagnosis of Campylobacter jejuni infection. The patient initially presented with several episodes of diarrhoea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Initial investigations confirmed an uncomplicated C. jejuni infection, which was treated with antibiotics and supportive measures. Despite treatment, the patient's symptoms persisted and worsened, and caecum perforation was confirmed on the abdomen and pelvis computed tomography. The patient underwent an emergency right hemicolectomy with an end ileostomy and was discharged home on postoperative day 14 after she made a full recovery. Healthcare professionals should be vigilant for possible severe complications in patients with C. jejuni infection. Frequent abdominal examinations with radiological investigations should be considered when symptoms are worsening to promptly identify any potentially life-threatening complications similar to those in the presenting case."

We aimed to evaluate characteristics and outcomes of patients with acute mesenteric ischemia requiring urgent surgical intervention.MethodsRetrospective cohort study of patients with mesenteric ischemia requiring urgent surgical intervention from 2018 to 2020 was queried from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. Study groups were defined as those requiring an open bypass (BYPASS), an open superior mesenteric artery embolectomy (OPEN), or ROMS. Descriptive statistics were used to report variables. Comparisons were mad using t test, chi-squares tests, and multivariate regression reported as odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI) where appropriate.Results898 patients with mesenteric ischemia requiring urgent surgical intervention were included: Bypass: 284, OPEN: 363, ROMS: 251. There was no difference in gender or race between groups. Patients requiring ROMS were more likely to be older 70.2 + 11.3versus Bypass 66.81 + 11.6 and OPEN 67.17 + 14.5, p = 0.0035. ROMS patients had the highest Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) 2.9 versus 2.5 Bypass and 2.6 OPEN, p = 0.0292 with the most frequent comorbidities: Diabetes 37% (p = 0.01), renal disease 24.3% (p = 0.5), and previous preoperative myocardial infarction 9.2%, p = 0.05; however, the lowest mortality rate was seen within this Group 15.9% versus bypass 19.7%, OPEN 34.5%, p < 0.0001. Patients requiring bypass were more likely to have chronic pulmonary disease 34.5% versus OPEN 24.2% and ROMS 31.5%, p = 0.013, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) 38% versus OPEN 16%, and ROMS 29.9%, p < 0.0001. On multivariate regression, ROMS was associated with 50% decreased incidence of mortality (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27-0.75). Open SMA embolectomy was associated with nearly 2x mortality rate compared to bypass procedures OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.3-3.0, p < 0.001. Previous MI was also associated with nearly 2x incidence of mortality (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.01-3.6), while pre-existing PVD conferred a protective effect (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36-0.89). Higher CCI and age were associated with slightly increased risk for mortality OR 1.2 and 1.03, p < 0.05 for both.ConclusionsIn patients with acute mesenteric ischemia, ROMS demonstrated a significant mortality benefit compared to traditional open procedures. Advanced age, history of MI, and open SMA embolectomy were associated with increased mortality. Little data exists regarding ROMS in a real-world population evaluating ROMS, which is a newer technique. These data suggest that ROMS may be a superior alternative to restore mesenteric flow in the acute setting and further prospective studies evaluating ROMS to other procedural types in urgent and elective settings are needed."

    "abstract": "The Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria have rapidly developed into a principal methodological framework for nutrition diagnosis. However, the applicability of the GLIM criteria in patients with acute abdomen has not been validated. This is a cross-sectional study conducted on patients diagnosed with acute abdomen and admitted to a tertiary hospital in southwest China. Nutrition risk screening was conducted using the Nutrition Risk Screening 2002, and patients identified with nutrition risk were assessed for malnutrition based on the GLIM criteria. We enrolled a total of 440 patients with acute abdomen. The top three diagnoses of acute abdomen were intestinal obstruction (47.2%), acute appendicitis (23.1%), and digestive system perforation (8.8%). The prevalence of nutrition risk was 46.5%, with a malnutrition rate of 32.5% based on the GLIM. Patients with malnutrition according to the GLIM showed significantly higher rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (13.28% vs 7.07%; P = 0.003), increased hospitalization costs (median: 3315USD [interquartile range (IQR): 978-7852] vs 1641 [IQR: 816-3523] USD; P < 0.001), and longer length of hospital stay (LOS) (median: 8 [IQR: 5-13] vs 6 [IQR: 4-8] days; P < 0.001) compared with patients without malnutrition. Multivariate analysis indicated that GLIM-defined malnutrition was an independent predictor of hospitalization costs, and severe malnutrition was an independent predictor of ICU admission. GLIM criteria are applicable for diagnosing malnutrition in patients with acute abdomen. The prevalence of malnutrition was high in patients with acute abdomen. Malnutrition was associated with increased ICU admission and LOS, along with higher economic burden."

    "abstract": "Foreign bodies may be ingested accidentally or intentionally. Generally, they pass through the digestive tract without causing complications unless they become lodged. Patients often present with nonspecific clinical symptoms, and diagnosis is frequently delayed because they do not recall ingesting anything. We report the case of a 20-year-old man who was admitted to the emergency room for acute moderate hematemesis. The patient had no significant medical history. An urgent, nonsedated upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy was performed, which revealed bleeding but no foreign objects. However, an abdominal CT scan identified a linear calcified object in the antrum, which was later confirmed to be a chicken bone upon endoscopic extraction. Ingested foreign bodies typically pass through the digestive tract without incident. However, long, sharp, and thin objects can remain in the gastrointestinal tract for 7-10 days and may become lodged in areas of physiological narrowing. This can lead to complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or bleeding."

The most common location of diverticula is the descending duodenum, usually on the lateral side next to the pancreas, so perforations present with an atypical clinical course. We present a case of a 73-year-old female patient with epigastric pain and nausea. Abdominal CT revealed an air-fluid collection near the laterocaudal border of the descending duodenum, suggestive of duodenal microperforation and incipient abscess formation. During the operation, a diverticulectomy was performed with primary duodenal closure and abdominal drainage. A diverticulum microperforation contains some extraduodenal air bubbles, no evidence of abscess, and free air in the subdiaphragmatic region. It is an imaging entity with distinct clinical and biochemical features, and radiological findings often determine the final decision on treatment."

Many types of internal hernias have been described in the literature; however, internal hernia caused by the ureter as a secondary complication of ureteroplasty is rare and only a few cases have been reported worldwide. This presentation discusses an interesting case of small bowel obstruction accompanied by obstruction of the urinary tract due to an internal hernia caused by the ureter. A 58-year-old female presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute pain in the abdominal and right lumbar region. Her surgical history includes hysterectomy, right ureter injury, and ureteroplasty performed 10 years ago. Clinical examination showed tenderness in the lower abdomen, positive Giordano's sign on the right, and metallic bowel sounds. A computer tomography scan revealed right-sided hydronephrosis, absence of excretion in the right urinary tract, and dilated loops of the small intestine. An exploratory laparoscopy revealed a small bowel loop strangulated by the ureter, followed by laparotomy, resection of a segment of the ileum, oblique anastomosis, and reimplantation of the right ureter. The patient was discharged eight days postoperatively without any complications. This case underscores the significance of surgical history in order to recognize even rarer causes of small bowel obstruction."

    "abstract": "Corneal perforations are potentially sight-threatening conditions if not promptly treated. Management depends on the size, location, cause, and severity of the perforation. Various methods, including tissue adhesives, amniotic membrane grafting (AMG), and keratoplasty, are available. However, the limited availability of donor tissue in emergencies poses a significant challenge. Recently, Tenon's patch grafting (TPG) has emerged as a promising treatment option due to its autologous nature, availability, and lack of immunogenicity. This review provides a comprehensive overview of various aspects of TPG, along with relevant images. A literature search using keywords such as \"Tenon's patch graft,\" \"Tenon's capsule,\" \"corneal patch graft,\" \"amniotic membrane,\" and \"corneal perforations\" yielded 37 articles, included in this review. TPG is suitable for cases involving corneal tissue degradation leading to perforation, impending perforation, or descemetocele, with lesion sizes ranging from 2 to 6 mm. For larger perforations, the procedure may be modified by combining it with AMG or tissue adhesives. Postoperatively, the graft undergoes characteristic changes, including epithelialization and collagen deposition, resulting in the formation of a thick scar. Complications such as delayed epithelialization, wound leaks, and graft dehiscence can occur. High success rates have been reported, ranging from 74% to 87%. However, TPG may result in suboptimal visual outcomes, particularly when the graft is centrally located, necessitating future keratoplasty for visual rehabilitation. Overall, TPG is a safe and cost-effective technique for restoring structural integrity in corneal thinning disorders and perforations, especially in emergency settings when donor tissue is unavailable."

    "title": "Factors Affecting Postoperative Early-term Mortality and Anastomotic Leakage in Geriatric Colorectal Cancer Patients.",
    "abstract": "In terms of early-term mortality, there may be variability in terms of factors belonging to age groups. While some risk factors apply to all patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery, some factors may come to the fore in terms of age. There have been very few studies on factors that increase the risk of early-term mortality, especially for geriatric patients. It was aimed to compare factors influencing prognosis and mortality within the first 30 postoperative days between geriatric patients and those <65 years of age, and to identify factors that increase the risk of anastomotic leakage and early-term mortality, particularly in geriatric patients. Clinical, laboratory, and pathology findings from 341 patients (186 geriatric) who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer between January 2016 and December 2019 were collected and analyzed. In terms of categorical variables, comparisons between groups were made with Pearson's Chi Square test and Fisher's Exact Test. Risk coefficients of variables in terms of anastomotic leakage and early-term mortality were determined by logistic regression analysis. The results were evaluated within the 95% Confidence interval, and p < 0.05 values were considered significant. Anastomotic leakage was detected in 7% of patients, and 6.2% of the patients died within the first 30 postoperative days. The 30-day postoperative mortality rate was significantly higher in geriatric patients with hypertension (p = 0.003), those undergoing emergency surgery (p = 0.007), those with stage 4 tumors (p < 0.001), those with ostomy-related complications (p = 0.042), those who developed intraabdominal abscess or peritonitis (p < 0.001), those with respiratory failure (p = 0.009), and those with perforation (p = 0.001). In patients <65 years of age, groups stratified by these variables did not differ significantly in terms of early-term mortality rate (p > 0.05 for each). These findings show that lack of bowel preparation and development of intraabdominal abscess/peritonitis significantly increase early-term mortality rates in both <65 and geriatric patients. Additionally, hypertension, emergency surgery, advanced tumor stage, development of ostomy-related complications, respiratory failure, and perforation significantly increase early-term mortality solely in geriatric patients."

Imaging performed, both ultrasound and computed tomography, reported acute appendicitis, without evidence of a broad ligament defect. During exploratory laparoscopy, the defect was identified, the appendix was retrieved and ligated and sutures were applied to the defect. The postoperative course of treatment was uneventful, and pathology confirmed inflammation of the appendix and also revealed a small neuroendocrine tumor.

We describe an adult Hirschsprung disease case found intraoperatively. He is a 20-year-old male patient with past medical history of epilepsy, psychomotor delay and recently a perineal perforating injury, admitted in the emergency room with initial diagnosis of peritonitis by perforated viscus with Frankel grad B spinal cord injury. Among his initial signs and symptoms were abdominal distension, rebound tenderness, decreased bowel sounds and diffuse pain. Laboratory tests revealed increased Hb, decreased white cells count and increased creatinine level. Initial management included: fluid resuscitation, analgesics, antibiotics and laxatives. After becoming hemodynamically unstable, the patient was introduced to the operating room where a highly dilated rectum with areas of necrosis at the base was discovered after access to the abdominal cavity. While doing the intervention, the patient experienced 3 cardiac arrests following by successful ressucitation and blood transfusion; leading to the decision to delay the definitive closure using the Bottega technique. The surgical course was unfavorable as the patient died around 4 hour post-surgery. Hirschsprung disease in adult, due to its rarity and its overlapping features with many other conditions that can affect the GI system, can be misdiagnosed or discovered lately. A thorough evaluation by an appropriate specialist is essential for adequate diagnosis and management."

Computed tomography scan revealed a foreign body perforating the small bowel. Exploratory laparotomy found a partially perforated MD with a foreign body. Diverticulectomy was performed, and the patient recovered, discharged the next day. Foreign bodies in MD are exceedingly rare and can cause inflammation, infection, and perforation, mimicking appendicitis. Diagnosis is challenging due to nonspecific symptoms, with imaging and clinical evaluation crucial. Surgical intervention, like diverticulectomy, is primary. Early diagnosis and prompt surgery are critical in managing MD complicated by foreign bodies, ensuring favorable outcomes.

However, the optimal timing for appendectomy remains unclear. We are not aware of studies evaluating potential differences in clinical outcomes among appendectomies performed during the daytime and at night. We followed the PRISMA guidelines and searched the ScienceDirect, Medline, and Google Scholar databases for studies published in English before June 2023. We included prospective and retrospective studies reporting appendectomy outcomes. We categorized the appendectomy procedure times as daytime or night-time based on each study's definitions. We extracted baseline characteristics and outcomes and assessed the quality of the studies included using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We calculated pooled risk ratios (RRs) and weighted mean differences (WMDs) using random-effects models; and, we assessed heterogeneity using the I2 statistic. We analyzed data from 12 studies for systematic review ( n =19,183) including daytime ( n =11,839) and night-time ( n =7344) appendectomies. For the meta-analysis, we included 9 studies, that evaluated outcomes such as mortality (pooled RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.09-2.01; I2 =43.7%; P =0.11), hospital stay (WMD, -0.02; 95% CI, -0.24 to 0.20; I2 =93.3%; P <0.001), and complications (pooled RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.64-1.45; I2 =65.1%; P =0.02). We found similar mortality rates, hospital stay lengths, and complications for the appendectomies, regardless of the time of day of the operation. The baseline characteristics of the patients were also similar, except for the duration of symptoms and the presence of an appendiceal abscess. Our results showed that the timing of an appendectomy (daytime vs. night-time) does not significantly affect its outcomes. Surgeon availability or fatigue, and patient severity may not significantly impact the operation results. Standardized protocols and perioperative care ensure consistent outcomes."

Laparoscopic appendectomy has become the standard treatment, with various methods for appendiceal stump closure, including polymeric clips and endoloops. This study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of polymeric clips compared with endoloops in laparoscopic appendectomy. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted followingPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PubMed, Medline, Scopus, and Embase were searched for studies up to March 25, 2024. In total, 13 studies, including 6 randomized controlled trials, were analyzed. Polymeric clipping demonstrated significantly shorter surgical time compared with the endoloop (standardized mean difference 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.22-0.53, P < .00001), with no difference in hospital stay or overall complications. However, the endoloop was associated with a greater incidence of intra-abdominal abscess (risk ratio 3.53, 95% confidence interval 1.56-8.00, P = .003). Other outcomes, including time from instrument application to appendiceal cutting, ileus, and surgical-site infection, showed no significant differences between the 2 techniques. Polymeric clipping appears to be superior to endoloop in terms of shorter surgical time and lower risk of intra-abdominal abscess formation in laparoscopic appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis. However, both techniques have similar outcomes regarding hospital stay and overall complications. Further research addressing study limitations and exploring patient-centered outcomes is warranted to guide clinical practice."

Implementing SDM in EDs seems particularly challenging, considering the fast-paced environment and sometimes life-threatening situations. Over 10 years ago, a previous review revealed only a few patient decision aids (PtDAs) available for EDs. Literature searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane library, up to November 2023. Observational and interventional studies were included to address barriers or facilitators for SDM or to investigate effects of PtDAs on the level of SDM for patients visiting an ED. We screened 1946 studies for eligibility, of which 33 were included. PtDAs studied in EDs address chest pain, syncope, analgesics usage, lumbar puncture, ureterolithiasis, vascular access, concussion/brain bleeding, head-CT choice, coaching for elderly people, and activation of patients with appendicitis. Only the primary outcome was meta-analyzed, showing that PtDAs significantly increased the level of SDM (18.8 on the 100-point OPTION scale; 95% CI 12.5-25.0). PtDAs also tended to increase patient knowledge, decrease decisional conflict and decrease health care services usage, with no obvious effect on overall patient satisfaction. Barriers and facilitators were identified on three levels: (1) patient level-emotions, health literacy, and their own proactivity; (2) clinician level-fear of medicolegal consequences, lack of SDM skills or knowledge, and their ideas about treatment superiority; and (3) system level-time constraints, institutional guidelines, and availability of PtDAs. Circumstances in EDs are generally less favorable for SDM. However, PtDAs for conditions seen in EDs are helpful in overcoming barriers to SDM and are welcomed by patients. Even in EDs, SDM is feasible and supported by an increasing number of tools for patients and physicians."

Four databases were searched with Medical Subject Heading terms describing pediatric surgery, immigration, limited English proficiency (LEP), and refugees between 2000-2023. Four independent reviewers screened and analyzed texts for final inclusion. Thirty-three studies were included. Ten studies described disease incidence and severity, finding that LEP, immigrant, and refugee patients were more likely to present with severe disease in appendicitis and traumatic injuries. five studies described pain management, finding patients with LEP received fewer pain assessments, waited longer for analgesia, and had more discrepancies in pain scores. Seventeen studies investigated treatment receipt and delay, finding that immigrants and patients with LEP had longer time to and reduced rates of treatment. Seventeen studies described surgical outcomes, finding that patients with LEP have longer length of stay and more postoperative emergency department visits but fewer follow-up appointments. In kidney transplants, patients with LEP and immigrants had worse outcomes, but these trends are not seen in immigrants from Europe. Overall, immigrants and refugees have higher rates of complications and mortality. Immigrants and patients with LEP and are more likely to present with advanced disease and severe injuries, receive inadequate pain management, experience delays in surgery, and suffer more complications. There is continued need to assess the impact of LEP and immigration on pediatric surgery outcomes."

    "abstract": "Although pneumoperitoneum from necrotizing enterocolitis or spontaneous intestinal perforation is a surgical emergency, risk stratification to determine which neonates benefit from initial peritoneal drainage (PD) is lacking. Using a single-center retrospective review of very low birth weight neonates under 1500 g who underwent PD for pneumoperitoneum (January 2015 to December 2023) from necrotizing enterocolitis or spontaneous intestinal perforation, two cohorts were created: drain \"responders\" (patients managed definitively with PD; includes placement of a second drain) and \"nonresponders\" (patients who underwent subsequent laparotomy or died after PD). Antenatal/postnatal characteristics, periprocedural clinical data, and hospital outcomes were compared between responders and nonresponders using Student's t-test, chi-squared test, or Kruskal-Wallis test as appropriate, with P < 0.05 considered significant. Fifty-six neonates were included: 31 (55%) drain responders and 25 (45%) nonresponders. Birth weight, gestational age, sex, ethnicity, use of postnatal steroids, and enteral feeds were similar between the cohorts. Nonresponders had higher base deficits (-3.4 versus -5.0, P = 0.032) and FiO2 (0.25 versus 0.52, P = 0.001) after drain placement. Drain responders had significantly shorter lengths of stay (89 versus 148 days, P = 0.014) and lower mortality (6.4% versus 56%, P < 0.001). A subgroup analysis of the nonresponders showed no differences in birth weight, vasopressor requirement, FiO2, or postdrain base deficit between nonresponders who had a drain alone versus laparotomy following drain placement. PD remains a viable initial therapy for pneumoperitoneum in premature very low birth weight neonates (< 1500 g), demonstrating clinical response in more than half. Ongoing clinical assessment and judgment is imperative after drain placement to ensure continued clinical improvement."

    "abstract": "Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is the most common type of Gastrointestinal (GI) lymphoma with known complications such as bleeding, obstruction and perforation. In this article we present a 59-year-old male patient diagnosed with Peripheral T cell Lymphoma - Not Otherwise Specified (PTCL-NOS) with GI involvement was started on chemotherapy. On day 2 post completion of first cycle of chemotherapy, patient had presented to the emergency department with sudden onset abdominal pain and distension. On evaluation, he was diagnosed with multiple perforations in the small bowel. Patient underwent exploration with primary repair of few perforations and ileal resection with double barrel ileostomy. Chemotherapy plays an important role in the management of NHL. One well-known NHL consequence, intestinal perforation, can happen at the time of initial presentation or after starting chemotherapy. Surgeons should be aware of possibility of such complications and high-risk factors for perforation. At present, there is no role for elective surgery in GI lymphoma and is mainly reserved for complications like uncontrolled bleeding, obstruction or perforation."

    "abstract": "Emergency surgery for a hiatal hernia (HH) is uncommon. However, mediastinal gastric perforation may occasionally present as the initial symptom of HH and demonstrate high mortality rates. Managing mediastinal gastric perforation in HH has no established standard surgical technique, and the selection of surgical techniques may be challenging. A 78-year-old female patient was referred to our department because of an upper gastrointestinal perforation in HH based on computed tomography (CT) results. Determining the possibility of esophageal perforation and intrathoracic penetration was difficult according to CT results alone, and whether a transthoracic or transabdominal approach was preferable. We diagnosed the patient with a mediastinal gastric perforation in HH without intrathoracic penetration based on an additional gastrointestinal contrast study and a right thoracentesis. We treated the patient with laparotomy, involving the perforation site and esophageal hiatus closure and gastropexy. Postoperatively, the patient experienced complications associated with delayed gastric emptying and aspiration pneumonia. Fortunately, no severe infections, such as residual abscess formation or empyema, were observed, and the recovery progressed favorably. Mediastinal gastric perforation should be considered a differential diagnosis for elderly patients with sudden-onset chest pain and dyspnea, and the threshold for imaging should be lowered. Identifying the perforation site and the presence of intrathoracic penetration based on preoperative results is useful for determining the appropriate surgical technique. Postoperative quality of life to the extent feasible needs to be considered, as the selection of surgical technique may cause subsequent recurrence or reflux symptoms."

    "abstract": "The study focuses on developing a bioactive shape memory sponge to address the urgent demand for short-term rapid hemostasis and long-term wound healing in noncompressible hemorrhage cases. A composite sponge was created by spontaneously generating pores and double cross-linking under mild conditions using biomimetic collagen fibril (BCF) and oxidized alginate (OA) as natural backbone, combined with an inert calcium source (Ca) from CaCO3-GDL slow gelation mechanism. The optimized BCF/OACa (5/5) sponge efficiently absorbed blood after compression and recovered to its original state within 11.2 ± 1.3 s, achieving physical hemostatic mechanism. The composite sponge accelerated physiological coagulation by promoting platelet adhesion and activation through BCF, as well as enhancing endogenous and exogenous hemostatic pathways by Ca2+. Compared to commercial PVA expanding hemostatic sponge, the composite sponge reduced bleeding volume and shortened hemostasis time in rat liver injury pick and perforation wound models. Additionally, it stimulated fibroblast migration and differentiation, thus promoting wound healing. It is biodegradable with low inflammatory response and promotes granulation tissue regeneration. In conclusion, this biocomposite sponge provides multiple hemostatic pathways and biochemical support for wound healing, is biologically safe and easy to fabricate, process and use, with significant potential for clinical translation and application."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common surgical emergency with various causes. However, SBO resulting from appendicitis is uncommon and often overlooked. Appendico-ileal knotting, a rare and dangerous form of SBO, occurs when the appendix becomes twisted around the small intestine, leading to strangulation. Despite being reported since 1901, there have been very few documented cases of this condition. Diagnosing appendico-ileal knotting preoperatively is challenging, and even imaging techniques like computed tomography scans may not provide definitive diagnostic findings. Our current case report is a valuable addition to the limited literature and enhances understanding of this infrequent cause of SBO from a resource limited setting. We present the case of a 28-year-old female who presented with symptoms of dynamic SBO, including abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation. Preoperative evaluation couldn't determine the exact cause. Diagnosis of a strangulated ileum was discovered, with the appendix identified as the source intraoperatively, leading to an open retrograde appendectomy. Postoperatively, the patient received IV ceftriaxone (1 g daily), metronidazole (500 mg tds), paracetamol (1 g tds), and IV crystalloids. Oral intake resumed gradually, and discharge occurred on day 4. Follow-up on 10th day was uneventful. Appendico ileal knotting is a rare cause of mechanical SBO. Knowledge of its pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management is very crucial to reduce its associated morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "Salmonella-induced peritonitis, secondary to spontaneous gastrointestinal perforation, is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition. We present a case of a 62-year-old female with a history of systemic hypertension, who presented with diffuse abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. Initial evaluation suggested acute gastroenteritis, but worsening symptoms led to emergent exploratory laparotomy, revealing a gastric/duodenal perforation. Peritoneal fluid analysis and culture confirmed Salmonella Paratyphi A infection. The patient underwent an emergency laparotomy with omental patch repair and received intravenous ceftriaxone, leading to a full recovery. This case underscores the importance of considering Salmonella infection in the differential diagnosis of peritonitis, prompt surgical intervention, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy for optimal management and outcomes. Further research on epidemiological trends, host-pathogen interactions, and antibiotic resistance should be explored. Clinical studies should refine diagnostic criteria and treatment protocols, while animal models can aid in understanding pathophysiology and vaccine development for Salmonella peritonitis. Public health interventions and environmental studies will enhance prevention and control strategies."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is one of the most common infectious diseases in the abdomen, while superior mesenteric vein thrombosis is a rare and potentially fatal complication of acute appendicitis. This report describes a case of a 26-year-old male initially presenting with nonspecific symptoms including coughing, runny nose, vomiting, and diffuse stomach ache. Radiological evaluation with an emergency computed tomography (CT) scan revealed acute complicated appendicitis with abscess formation, perforation, and a large thrombosis in the superior mesenteric vein (SMV). The patient underwent laparoscopic appendectomy with ileocecal resection of the appendix and right-sided ileostomy placement. Treatment included antibiotics and anticoagulant therapy. SMV thrombosis is challenging to diagnose clinically, and early diagnosis and treatment are vital. A CT scan plays a significant role in detecting unsuspected SMV thrombosis, highlighting the importance for radiologists to be aware of this rare complication to appendicitis."

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of abdominal pain in emergency departments is challenging, and appendicitis is a common concern. Atypical symptoms often delay diagnosis. Although the Alvarado score aids in decision-making, its low specificity can lead to unnecessary surgeries. By leveraging machine learning, we aim to enhance diagnostic accuracy by predicting appendicitis and distinguishing it from other causes of abdominal pain in the emergency department. Data were collected from 534 patients who presented with acute abdominal pain. Patient characteristics, laboratory results, and causes of pain were recorded. Machine learning algorithms (support vector classifier, random forest classifier, gradient boosting classifier, and Gaussian naive Bayes) were used to predict the cause of pain. Model calibration was assessed using the Brier score. The mean age was 46.89 (20.3) years, with an almost equal sex distribution (49% male, 51% female). Cholecystitis was the most prevalent outcome (37.07%), followed by appendicitis (25.84%). The Gaussian naive Bayes model exhibited superior performance in terms of accuracy (95.03% 95% CI 90.44-97.83%), sensitivity (87.18% 95% CI 72.57-95.70%), and specificity (97.54% 95% CI 92.98-99.49%), while the random forest model showed a sensitivity of 79.49%, specificity of 96.72%, and accuracy of 92.55%. The gradient boosting algorithm achieved a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 89.74%, 95.90%, and 94.41%, respectively. The support vector classifier demonstrated a sensitivity of 89.74%, specificity of 92.62%, and accuracy of 91.93%.

    "abstract": "The technique of open abdomen refers to a surgical procedure that intentionally involves leaving an opening in the abdominal wall. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes, mortality, and morbidity of patients undergoing open abdomen in a public hospital in Brazil and investigate associated risk factors associated with the outcome. Data from electronic medical records were collected from 2017 to 2022. The variables were used for descriptive analyses, association analysis, and survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier curve. The sample included 104 patients, with 84 presenting with acute abdomen and 20 with trauma, having highly variable ages and comorbidities. Peritonitis and the need for early reoperation were the most common indication for the procedure, each accounting for 34%, and negative pressure wound therapy was the most commonly used technique. Fistula was the most frequent complication, with the majority forming in the early days after the surgery. The number of interventions and open abdomen time obtained statistical significance in comparison with the outcome. The overall mortality rate was 62,5%. Despite open abdomen being a technique that can have benefits in controlling intraabdominal contamination and preventing abdominal compartment syndrome, its implementation is associated with complications. The mortality and complication rates were high in this sample. The decision to use the technique should be individualized and based on several factors, including the indications and the patient's clinical status. A técnica de abdome aberto refere-se a um procedimento cirúrgico que envolve deixar deliberadamente uma abertura na parede abdominal. Este estudo teve como objetivo avaliar o desfecho clínico, mortalidade e morbidade de pacientes submetidos ao abdome aberto em um hospital público do Brasil e investigar fatores de risco associados ao desfecho. Dados a partir de prontuários eletrônicos foram coletados de 2017 a 2022. As variáveis foram utilizadas para análises descritivas, análise de associação e de sobrevivência pela curva Kaplan-Meier. A amostra correspondeu a 104 pacientes, sendo 84 por abdome agudo e 20 por trauma, com idade e número de comorbidades variados. A peritonite e a necessidade de reabordagem precoce foram as causas mais comuns para a indicação do procedimento, 34% cada, e a terapia de pressão negativa foi a mais utilizada neste estudo, seguindo a técnica de Barker. Fístula é a complicação mais frequente (41%), sendo que a maioria se formou nos primeiros dias após a realização da cirurgia. O número de intervenções e o tempo de abdome aberto obtiveram significância estatística na comparação com o desfecho. A mortalidade geral foi de 62,5%. Apesar de o abdome aberto ser uma técnica que pode trazer benefícios no controle da contaminação intra-abdominal e prevenção de síndrome compartimental abdominal, sua realização está associada a complicações. A taxa de mortalidade e morbidade foram elevadas nesta amostra. A decisão para uso da técnica deve ser individualizada e baseada em vários fatores, incluindo as indicações e o estado clínico do paciente."

The other baby was a preterm neonate with an antenatal scan showing small bowel obstruction. All children underwent emergency laparotomy and were found to have a mesenteric defect with herniation and gangrene of the small bowel. Resection anastomosis of the gangrenous segment and closure of the mesenteric defect were done. The differential for small bowel obstruction in children should include transmesentric hernia.

    "abstract": "Caustic ingestion almost occurs accidentally in children and mostly intentionally in adults. The ingestion of caustic substances can cause various degrees of damage to the gastrointestinal tract. Depending on the severity of the injury, surgery may be a part of the treatment plan. A 32-year-old man was referred to our hospital after swallowing drain cleaner. Due to evidence of peritonitis and endoscopy results, he underwent emergency surgery. During the surgery, necrotic parts, including the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, head of the pancreas, and initial part of the jejunum, were resected. Then, after six months, colon interposition surgery was done to reconstruct the gastrointestinal tract. Like trauma patients, managing patients with caustic injuries begins with an initial survey of the airway, breathing, and circulation status. In the first 48 h, early esophagoscopy is indicated to evaluate the amount of injury. Evidence of transmural necrosis or perforation is the most important indication for surgery, and surgical procedures are specific to each patient. Esophagogastrectomy is the most common surgery in cases of severe gastrointestinal injuries, but removing more abdominal organs may be needed in fewer cases. This case report underscores the urgent need for further research and the development of evidence-based guidelines in managing caustic injury with extensive necrosis in the gastrointestinal tract. Our experience with this rare case highlights the importance of such guidelines in improving patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "In past studies, non-medical factors in the social-healthcare-patient triad associated with the prevalence of COVID-19 have led to delays in the presentation of patients with acute appendicitis and an increase in complications. However, as research progresses, there is increasing evidence of a clinical association between COVID-19 and the development of acute appendicitis. The effect of COVID-19 prevalence and associated factors on acute appendicitis in the control (2016-2019) and exposed (2020-2023) groups was derived from a retrospective study of 3070 patients with acute appendicitis from 2016 to 2023. After the implementation of the restrictions, the rate of acute appendicitis visits in the exposed group compared to the control group dropped sharply in the initial period (P = 0.047) and recovered gradually with the relaxation of the restrictions. Similar changes occurred in the number of acute complicated appendicitis visits. In addition, after the lifting of restrictions and the COVID-19 outbreak, the proportion of acute complicated appendicitis in the exposed group increased significantly (P < 0.001) and an increase in the number of complicated appendicitis visits was observed (P < 0.001) compared with the control group. In addition, the age distribution of acute appendicitis during this period showed an ageing trend (P = 0.001). COVID-19 infections may be more likely to progress to complicated appendicitis after an episode of appendicitis, even if they have been cured for the same period of time. In addition, the proportion of elderly patients with appendicitis increased after the COVID-19 epidemic."

    "title": "The contemporary management of perforated appendicitis in adults: To operate or wait?",
    "abstract": "The optimal management of perforated appendicitis remains controversial. Many studies advocate for antibiotics and an interval appendectomy whereas others suggest that performing an appendectomy at the time of presentation decreases post-operative morbidity. Confounding this argument further are the patients who fail non-operative management and end up requiring surgery during their initial hospitalization. This study aims to determine if early operative intervention should be considered for perforated appendicitis. This was a retrospective review of all patients who underwent an appendectomy (both laparoscopic or open) for perforated appendicitis between 2015 and 2020 at our institution. A total of 271 patients met inclusion criteria for this study. Of this group, 250 patients underwent an immediate appendectomy whereas the remaining 21 patients underwent a trial of non-operative management and eventually required an appendectomy during their initial admission. When comparing the immediate versus delayed operative groups, there were no differences in demographic data including age and gender, and no differences in various imaging findings including AAST Grade IV or V appendicitis. Operatively, patients in the delayed group had a longer operative time (83.1 ± 32.9 vs. 64.1 ± 26.2, p = 0.01), were more likely to require an open operation (23.8 % vs. 2.8 %, p < 0.0001), and were more likely to have a drain placed intra-operatively (42.9 % vs 14.4 %, p = 0.004). While there were no differences in 30-day readmission rates, patients in the delayed group had a significantly longer hospital length of stay than patients in the immediate group (9.4 ± 7.4 vs. 3.1 ± 3.3, p = 0.008). Patients undergoing an immediate appendectomy for perforated appendicitis can discharge from the hospital sooner and demonstrate no increase in post-operative morbidity suggesting that surgeons can initially manage this disease process in an operative fashion."

    "title": "Clinical Scoring Systems to Diagnose Complicated Acute Appendicitis in a Rural Hospital: Are They Good Enough?",
    "abstract": "Introduction Acute appendicitis (AA) is the most common surgical emergency in developed countries, whose incidence peaks in the second and third decades. The risk of mortality in uncomplicated AA is very low. There are many scoring systems to predict AA. Prediction scores are used less frequently to predict complicated AA. Rural hospitals are often constrained by a lack of round-the-clock imaging or special laboratory services, which may enable accurate diagnosis. Materials and methods This study aimed to determine whether prediction scores without imaging or C-reactive protein (CRP) levels could predict complicated AA in a rural setting. All cases of AA for the previous 13 months were recruited for the study. Demographic data, clinical signs and symptoms, complete blood counts, intraoperative findings, and the corresponding histopathological results were collated. The scoring systems (Alvarado, RIPASA, Tzanakis, and Ohmann) were calculated from the clinical and laboratory data. Demographic variables, clinical features, and histopathological findings are described as frequencies/proportions. Chi-squared and Student's t-tests were used to analyze differences between patients with complicated and uncomplicated AA. A receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was performed to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) and determine whether appendicitis scores could predict complicated AA. Results There were 76 patients with a mean age of 29.1±13.0 years. Serositis was observed in 65% of the patients; mucosal ulceration was the most common microscopic finding, with a pathological diagnosis of AA in 58 (76.3%) patients. Rovsing's sign and the presence of phlegmon and granuloma were significantly different between those with and without complicated AA. The clinical prediction scores were not significantly different between the two groups. The Tzanakis and Ohmann scores were significant (cutoff: 6.5 and 7.25, p=0.001 and 0.01, respectively) in diagnosing AA (sensitivity/specificity of 98.3/66.7 and 98.3/94.4, respectively). With a cutoff of 5.75, the RIPASA score, with an AUC of 0.663 (p=0.09), showed the highest sensitivity (90.7) and specificity (76.6) for diagnosing complicated AA. Conclusion Diagnosing AA based solely on clinical presentation remains a challenge. This study showed that clinical scores such as those of Alvarado, RIPASA, Tzanakis, and Ohmann could not accurately predict complicated AA. Scoring systems without imaging and intraoperative diagnoses are not infallible; therefore, histopathological examination of the resected appendix is mandatory."

    "abstract": "This is a challenging case where the surgeon has initially thought it is a gallbladder (GB) mucocele. The surprise finding of a mucocele during an emergency laparotomy highlights the deceptive nature of certain clinical manifestations within the hepatobiliary domain. The intraoperative discovery of a 1×1 cm GB hole on the right lateral wall of the GB fundus revealed an unexpected and significant deviation from the hypothesized pathogenesis. This case report provides a complicated diagnosis scenario for a hepatobiliary illness aggravated by schizophrenia. Arriving with frequent nausea and vomiting, a 70-year-old female patient with schizophrenia missed typical symptoms of gallbladder (GB) disease, including fever and stomach discomfort. This odd look and corroborative imaging showing a cystic lesion in the right belly led to a diagnostic suspicion of a sizable GB mucocele. But a surprising result from an emergency laparotomy revealed a significant GB perforation, different from the previous diagnosis. This case highlights the difficulties in identifying atypical GB diseases, particularly in individuals with mental comorbidities that could conceal or alter the expression of physical symptoms. To confirm or rule out differential diagnosis and allow early and tailored treatments, it emphasizes the need for thorough diagnostic tests, including a complete clinical history, physical examinations, laboratory analysis, imaging modalities, and surgical procedures. This case emphasizes the importance of careful examination in complex medical contexts by stressing the requirement of thorough assessments and comprehensive diagnostic frameworks in navigating challenging clinical situations."

We reviewed the data of patients who underwent surgery for lower gastrointestinal perforation. Patients were categorized into two groups: the laparoscopic group who underwent laparoscopic surgery, and the open group who underwent laparotomy. Clinical and operative outcomes between the two groups were evaluated. A total of 219 patients were included in the study. There were 66 and 153 patients with small bowel and colorectal perforations, respectively. The median operative time in the laparoscopic group was shorter than that in the open group (126 min vs. 146 min, p = .049). The mean amount of intraoperative blood loss was significantly lower in the laparoscopic group (50.4 mL vs. 400.1 mL, p < .001). The incidence of postoperative complication was higher in the open group (20.0% vs. 66.5%, p < .001), especially wound infection (0% vs. 26.3%, p = .002). Median hospital stays were 14 days and 24 days in the laparoscopic and open groups, respectively (p < .001). In the laparoscopic group, hospital mortality was 0%. The laparoscopic approach for small bowel and colorectal perforation in an emergency setting is a safe procedure in carefully selected patients and may contribute to decreased intraoperative blood loss, shortened hospital stay, and decreased incidence of postoperative complications, especially wound infection."

This study assesses the association between LEP and postoperative outcomes in pediatric appendectomy. We analyzed records from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric database from 2010 to 2023 under 18 y of age undergoing appendectomy at our institution. LEP was defined as the need for an interpreter. Primary outcomes were postoperative complications, length of stay (LOS), and postoperative emergency department (ED) visits within 30 d of discharge. Multivariable analyses were performed. One thousand one hundred forty three children with appendicitis were identified, with 208 (18.2%) LEP and 935 (81.8%) English-proficient patients. LEP children were more likely to present with complicated appendicitis (42.8% versus 25.5%, P < 0.0001) and sepsis (34.1% versus 21.6%, P = 0.0003). LEP patients experience more serious (8.6% versus 3.9%, P = 0.02), overall complications (10.1% versus 5.5%, P = 0.006), and organ/surgical space site infections (8.2% versus 3.3%, P = 0.003). On multivariable analysis controlling for ethnicity and factors associated with complicated presentation, LEP was associated with increased postoperative ED visits (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.40-4.39), but not LOS (aOR 1.86, 95% CI = 0.87-3.97) or complications (aOR 1.76, 95% CI = 0.79-4.00). LEP is independently associated with increased postoperative ED visits. Higher rates of complications and longer LOS may be related to increased complicated appendicitis at presentation. The role of cultural preferences and other social determinants of health that contribute to these disparities needs more investigation."

Having been operational for about 4 years, there has not been a systematic audit to gauge its performance. Therefore, this quantitative retrospective cohort study aimed at investigating the performance of the intensive care unit at Kamuzu Central Hospital in Lilongwe, Malawi. We analysed the patterns of admission through 250 clinical cases and their respective outcomes spanning from 1st January 2019 to 31st December 2019 using STATA. Descriptive and inferential statistics were computed. We also had a follow-up discussion with the Head of the unit to better understand the unit's functioning. Out of the 250 admissions, we evaluated 249 case files. About 30.8% of all patients were referred from the main operating theatre, and 20.7% from the casualty (emergency medicine). Head injury (26.7%) and peritonitis (15.7%) were the commonest causes of admission. The overall mortality was 52.2% with more females (57.5%) dying than males (47.9%). Head injury and peritonitis had the highest contribution to the mortality accounting for 25.3% and 16.9% of all deaths respectively. In conclusion, despite the new unit registering an improved performance compared to the old unit's 2012 mortality of 60.9%, the current mortality rate of 52.2% generally reflects a suboptimal performance. The intensive care unit is still grappling with a number of challenges that need immediate attention including few working beds, shortage of critical care specialists and nursing staff and lack of standard admission criteria."

A 52-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency department for 1 month with recurrent right middle and upper abdominal pain. Computed tomography diagnosis: cholecystitis and peri-inflammation, small abscess around the base of the gallbladder, local peritonitis, and bilateral pleural effusion. After admission, conservative treatment was given. On the 4th day of admission, the symptoms worsened, and an emergency catheter drainage was performed on the right thoracic cavity to extract 900 mL of dark yellow effusion. After the operation, a large amount of bili-like fluid was continuously drained from the thoracic drainage tube. After the iatrogenic biliary fistula caused by thoracic puncture was excluded, cholecystopleural fistula was considered to be cholecystopleural fistula. On the 6th day of admission, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) + cholecystography + Oddi sphincterotomy + laminating biliary stent was performed in the emergency department, and cholecystopleural fistula was confirmed during the operation. The patient recovered well after surgery, computed tomography examination on the 20th day after surgery indicated that pleural effusion was significantly reduced, and the patient was cured and discharged. The patient returned to the hospital 8 months after the ERCP operation to pull out the bile duct-covered stent. The patient did not complain of any discomfort after the postoperative follow-up for 3 years, and no recurrence of stones, empyema, and other conditions was found. Cholecystopleural fistula is one of the serious complications of acute cholecystitis, which is easy to misdiagnose clinically. If the gallbladder inflammation is severe, accompanied by pleural effusion, the pleural effusion is bili-like liquid, or the content of bilirubin is abnormally elevated, the existence of the disease should be considered. Once the diagnosis is clear, active surgical intervention is needed to reduce the occurrence of complications. Endoscopic therapy (ERCP) can be used as both a diagnostic method and an important minimally invasive treatment."

    "abstract": "Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) affects ~4 million people globally. Peptic ulcer perforation (PUP) is a serious complication of PUD associated with high mortality and morbidity. Hence, a high index of clinical suspicion is crucial in diagnosing such cases. Here, we present a case of a 19-year-old male who presented with 4 days of severe abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting. On examination, signs of acute abdomen were evident, and an erect chest X-ray confirmed free air under the diaphragm. The patient underwent an emergency midline laparotomy, during which 1000 ml of purulent fluid was evacuated. A perforation measuring 8 × 8 mm2 was repaired using the falciform ligament due to the unavailability of adequate healthy omentum. His postoperative recovery was uneventful. This case report underscores the importance of considering the falciform ligament as a viable and effective alternative for the closure of PUP when the omentum is unavailable."

The case underscores the role of computed tomography (CT) imaging in diagnosis and multidisciplinary management involving emergency physicians, radiologists, anesthetists, and surgeons. Key points highlighted include the rarity of postpartum hydatid cyst rupture, the diagnostic utility of CT scans, and the necessity of immediate surgical intervention. Surgical strategies include conservative techniques and intraoperative lavage with hypertonic saline solution to prevent recurrence. Postoperative albendazole therapy and regular follow-up aid in preventing recurrence and early detection of complications. This case underscores the importance of suspecting ruptured hydatid cysts in postpartum women with underlying hepatic hydatid cyst and features of peritonitis, necessitating prompt recognition and management of complications in hydatid disease."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous mesenteric hematoma is a rare condition that is diagnosed when clinical and pathological findings do not identify an obvious causative disease. Various treatment options for spontaneous mesenteric hematoma exist; however, there are no clear treatment criteria. Herein, we report a case of spontaneous mesenteric hematoma that was successfully treated surgically and discuss the optimum treatment strategy based on similar cases. A 63-year-old man with abdominal persisting for 3 days presented to our hospital after going into shock without any triggers. The patient had a history of atrial fibrillation, stroke, and an aneurysm, and was receiving antithrombotic therapy. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a mass structure within the sigmoid mesentery, which was suspected to be a hematoma. The patient was admitted to the hospital for follow-up observation after initial infusion and vital stabilization. However, the following day, the patient developed acute generalized peritonitis with necrosis of the sigmoid colon; therefore, emergency Hartmann's surgery was performed. Intraoperative and histopathological examinations revealed no evidence of bleeding. Spontaneous mesenteric hematomas tend to be associated with intestinal necrosis and may require surgical treatment with bowel resection owing to the difficulty in identifying the responsible vessel. Moreover, our results suggest that the presence of antithrombotic therapy may be an important factor affecting spontaneous mesenteric hematoma development."

Tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) is seen less in postmenopausal women amounting the 6%-18% of the total cases of TOA reported. A 52-year-old P3L3 postmenopausal woman with abdominal pain was admitted to hospital. Emergency laparotomy was performed in view of pyoperitoneum. Intraoperatively, 1000 cc of foul-smelling pus was suctioned out from the peritoneal cavity a 2 cm × 2 cm sized perforation was seen at the right fundal region of the uterus and a right sided TOA was seen extending to the uterine cavity, left sided ovary was normal. A total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. The patient got discharged on the 36th postoperative hospitalization day. Histopathological study revealed uterine purulent inflammation with no evidence of malignancy. The diagnosis of spontaneous perforation of pyometra is rarely made preoperatively and the possibility of a perforated pyometra should, therefore, be considered when elderly women suffer from acute abdominal pain. Hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy may be the best choice procedure in these patients. There is probably a new trend in the epidemiology of TOA, occurring in older women who do not present the traditional risk factors for pelvic inflammatory disease and TOA."

    "abstract": "Late perforation of the ileum is a rare and potentially life-threatening complication following intestinal resection. We present a unique case of a woman in her 60s with a history of appendiceal carcinoid tumour, who underwent a right hemicolectomy. Positron emission tomography and surveillance CTs showed normal surgical changes and no recurrent malignancy. Three years postoperatively, she presented with severe abdominal pain. CT revealed a perforation along the ileal wall of the ileocolonic anastomosis. She underwent emergent resection and repeat ileocolonic anastomosis. We conclude that the patient had subclinical ischaemia of the anastomosis, which eventually progressed to perforation 3 years later. We discuss a literature review on late small intestinal anastomotic perforations and their associated risk factors. Our case and literature review emphasise the importance of considering delayed anastomotic leak in postoperative patients with a history of intestinal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, Roux-en-Y enteroenterostomy or side-to-side anastomosis."

    "abstract": "Background Bacteria and parasites cause liver abscesses (LAs), with the unusual but fatal consequence of ruptured LA. Along with the clinical signs of icterus, right upper quadrant pain, and a history of loose stools, patients present with non-specific symptoms such as fever, nausea, and generalized weakness. Consistent findings include male sex prevalence and frequent alcohol consumption. Leukocytosis, abnormal liver function, and an increased international normalized ratio have been identified by biochemical analysis; however, these findings are not specific to a ruptured LA diagnosis, and imaging is necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis. Ultrasonography usually confirms the diagnosis, and computed tomography is required in certain situations. In confined ruptures, percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotic therapy is typically the initial treatment course. Generally reserved for non-responders or moribund patients with delayed presentation, an open surgical approach may involve simple draining of a ruptured abscess or ileocecal resection, or right hemicolectomy in cases of large bowel perforations, both of which increase patient morbidity. A definite guide to management is still missing in the literature. In this article, we have discussed and correlated with data the predictors of surgery and preoperative predictors of perforation. Materials and methods This retrospective study was performed at Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi, between January 2022 and December 2023. The study included 115 patients diagnosed with ruptured LA by ultrasound. Medical records were analyzed, and various parameters of the illness, clinical features, hematological and biochemical profiles, ultrasound features, and therapeutic measures were noted and assessed. Results Of the 115 patients, 88% (n = 101) were male. The most common symptoms were abdominal pain (114 patients) and right upper abdominal tenderness (107 patients). Fifty-two patients were treated with percutaneous drainage, and 42 underwent laparotomy. Intercostal drainage (ICD) tubes were placed in 19 patients. Sixteen patients had large bowel perforations. Twenty-three patients died (20%), including 17 patients who underwent laparotomy and nine patients who had large bowel perforation (39.1% associated with overall mortality, 52.9% associated with mortality in laparotomy). One patient with percutaneous drainage and a right ICD tube died in the intensive care unit. Four patients died before intervention. Significant associations were noted between perforation and mortality in patients who underwent surgical drainage. Loose motions, alcohol and smoking consumption, and deranged creatinine and albumin levels were found to have a significant association with surgical drainage. Conclusion The study found that a ruptured liver abscess (LA) may require surgery to drain the collection or repair the pathological bowel, which increases the morbidity, but it is a lifesaving procedure over percutaneous catheter drainage. The study also identified factors associated with a higher risk of death, such as a history of loose stools and low blood albumin levels."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis (AA) is the most common emergency general surgical condition worldwide. Diagnosis is challenging and incorporates clinical, biochemical and radiological investigations. Our aim was to provide data from routine practice investigating widely utilised diagnostic methods from a single centre within the United Kingdom. We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of patients who underwent a laparoscopic appendicectomy for AA between April 2022 and March 2023. AA was defined as the presence of transmural polymorphonuclear leukocytes in histology. Subgroup analysis was performed on paediatric patients. Factors associated with AA were investigated, and the diagnostic utility of biochemical and radiological investigations was examined. A total of 330 appendicectomies were analysed. We found an overall negative appendicectomy rate (NAR) of 38% and 48% in paediatric patients. Independent factors associated with AA on the multivariate analysis included elevated neutrophil counts (>7 × 109/L) (OR 4.04), elevated CRP (>5 mg/L) (OR 3.04) and a radiological diagnosis (OR 8.0). Computerised tomography (CT) and ultrasound had sensitivity/specificity of 98%/47% and 35%/86%, respectively. The positive-predictive values were 85% for CT and 50% for ultrasound, and the negative-predictive values were 86% for CT and 77% for ultrasound. Our study has highlighted the importance of utilising a combination of factors to improve the diagnostic certainty of AA. However, our routine practice data have shown different sensitivities and specificities of imaging in comparison to existing literature, resulting in a high NAR. Further real-world data are needed to understand whether these differences from the existing data are seen in other clinical settings."

    "abstract": "Gallstone ileus is a rare condition resulting from cholelithiasis, associated with the formation of a fistula between the gallbladder and the intestinal tract. It is responsible for less than 0.1 % of cases of mechanical bowel obstruction. A 54-year-old male with hypertension presented with symptoms of intestinal obstruction, including inability to pass stool, anorexia, abdominal pain, vomiting, and oliguria. Physical examination revealed epigastric tenderness and a distended abdomen without jaundice. Laboratory tests indicated mild anemia. The patient initially refused any surgical interventions, so he was placed on conservative treatment for 24 h. Subsequently, an emergency exploratory open laparotomy was performed, revealing a gallstone causing small bowel obstruction. A constricted ileal loop, 15 cm in length, with stone impaction was resected, and an end-to-end anastomosis was performed. A cholecystogastric fistula was identified and repaired, and a retrograde cholecystectomy was performed. The patient recovered without complications. Gallstone ileus occurs when a fistula develops between the gallbladder and the intestinal tract. Notably, the presence of a fistula connecting the gallbladder and stomach ranges from 0 % to 13.3 %. Cholecystoenteric fistulas (CEFs) typically occur in elderly women in their seventh or eighth decade of life. Diagnosis often relies on CT scanning, and surgical intervention remains the primary treatment. Interestingly, despite improved awareness and imaging techniques, some cases are still discovered incidentally during surgery. This case highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges posed by gallstone ileus, and emphasizes the importance of considering gallstone-related disorders in differential diagnoses for acute abdominal obstruction."

    "abstract": "A volvulus refers to the torsion or rotational twisting of a portion of the gastrointestinal tract, with a predilection for impacting the caecum and sigmoid colon, often resulting in the development of bowel obstruction. The risk factors associated are old age, chronic fecal impaction, psychiatric disorders, colonic dysmotility, prior abdominal surgical procedures, diabetes, and Hirschsprung's disease. Elderly are most commonly affected with sigmoid volvulus but there are few cases among young adults that culminate in grave complications. Although it is rare, but young individuals presenting with acute abdomen secondary to sigmoid volvulus need urgent attention. To prevent more invasive surgical procedures, endoscopic detorsion is preferred nowadays with complete recovery of patients. We present a case of young female who was successfully managed with endoscopic detorsion. 27 years old Asian Pakistani female presented with worsening abdominal distention, constipation and vomiting since 2 days. On examination she was afebrile, vitally stable. Abdomen was distended, tympanic percussion with generalized tenderness. Abdominal radiograph was obtained which showed dilated bowel loops followed by Computed tomography of abdomen which was suggestive of Sigmoid volvulus causing intestinal obstruction. Patient was immediately moved to endoscopy unit and endoscopic detorsion of volvulus was done. For individuals who present with sigmoid volvulus and do not exhibit signs of peritonitis or colonic gangrene, the recommended course of action involves acute endoscopic detorsion, followed by scheduled surgical intervention. This case report emphasizes the significance of clinicians considering sigmoid volvulus as a rare but important cause when evaluating abdominal pain in young and otherwise healthy patients. A delay in diagnosis and treatment extending beyond 48 hours leads to colonic necrosis, amplifying the associated morbidity and mortality. Swift intervention is imperative to mitigate these complications and attain a conclusive remedy."

    "title": "High-Fidelity Simulation with Transvaginal Ultrasound in the Emergency Department.",
    "abstract": "Intern and junior emergency medicine residents. Abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy are common presentations to the emergency department (ED).1 Formal transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is considered the test of choice for evaluation of first trimester pregnancy due to its high sensitivity and specificity for identifying intrauterine and ectopic pregnancies.1 Additionally, TVUS can evaluate for various uterine and ovarian pathology as well as identify other non-gynecologic conditions and is within the scope of practice for the emergency physician.2 Given the emergent and time sensitive nature of certain obstetric and gynecologic conditions, formal transvaginal ultrasound imaging may not be feasible. A rapid assessment with transvaginal point-of-care ultrasound (TVPOCUS) can be utilized by emergency medicine physicians (EMP) to confirm intrauterine pregnancies (IUP) and identify any associated complications. There are multiple advantages to TVPOCUS including reduced cost and length of stay, patient satisfaction, and improved resource utilization.1,3 Additionally, multiple studies demonstrate that EMPs can learn this skill and perform TVPOCUS accurately and safely.1,3 Developing the skills and comfort with TVPOCUS in a simulation setting during residency is beneficial and can have important implications in future practice. By the end of the session, learners should be able to 1) recognize the clinical indications for transvaginal ultrasound in the ED, 2) practice the insertion, orientation, and sweeping motions used to perform a TVPOCUS study, 3) interpret transvaginal ultrasound images showing an IUP or alternative pathologies, and 4) understand proper barrier, disinfection, and storage techniques for endocavitary probes. This session included three high-fidelity simulation cases that allowed participants to utilize TVPOCUS in a safe and conducive environment. There was a total of 32 emergency medicine (EM) residents who participated. The simulation sessions were divided into two separate rooms and included four learners for each session that actively managed the patient, for a total of 12 active participants. The 20 remaining residents were observers. Participants learned evidence-based indications, performance, and interpretation of transvaginal ultrasound. Three cases were reviewed and included IUP, ruptured ectopic pregnancy with hemorrhagic shock, and appendicitis in pregnancy. The cases were followed by a debriefing session and discussion regarding the evidence behind bedside transvaginal ultrasound, its incorporation into EM workflow, and practice-based learning. The educational content and efficacy were evaluated by oral feedback in a debriefing session after the workshop. Additionally, pre-simulation and post-simulation surveys were sent to participants to assess prior ultrasound experience and confidence on the indications, performance, and interpretation of transvaginal ultrasound. Responses were collected using a Likert scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being \"not at all confident\" and 5 being \"very confident.\" Ten learners responded to the survey consisting of EM residents in a three-year EM residency program. Prior to the workshop, the median reported confidence level across all questions was \"1- not at all confident\" for the PGY-1 class, and \"3-neutral\" for the PGY-2 and PGY-3 classes. Following the workshop, all median scores across all classes were \"4-confident,\" demonstrating an increase in confidence scoring across all measurements and participants. Incorporating transvaginal ultrasound into clinical workflow demonstrated the largest increase in confidence score (median 1.5 to 4), followed by insertion/orientation of the endocavitary probe (median 2.5 to 5). This high-fidelity simulation familiarized learners with transvaginal ultrasound and how it can be appropriately utilized for a variety of high-yield clinical scenarios that present regularly to the ED. Given the variation in ultrasound training among residency programs, and the lack of specific simulation content addressing this modality, it is important to implement scenarios that improve learner comfort with TVPOCUS. Overall, this workshop resulted in an increase in confidence scores of participants in the indication, performance, and interpretation of TVPOCUS in the ED.

    "abstract": "Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the small bowel are rare but clinically significant due to their challenging diagnostic pathways and potential for insidious progression. Early identification is critical for effective management and improved prognosis in these cases. Here, we present a case of a 75-year-old patient with no significant medical history who presented acutely with diffuse abdominal pain, vomiting, and signs of bowel obstruction. Diagnostic workup, including CT imaging, revealed a distal ileal neuroendocrine mass with mesenteric lymphadenopathy, necessitating urgent surgical intervention. This case underscores the diagnostic complexities and therapeutic challenges associated with small bowel NETs. Surgical resection with meticulous lymph node dissection remains the cornerstone of treatment, aimed at achieving complete tumor excision and optimal disease control. The role of imaging modalities and biochemical markers in guiding clinical decisions and postoperative management strategies is discussed considering the patient's clinical course. Timely recognition and intervention are crucial in the management of small bowel NETs, given their potential for late presentation and nonspecific symptoms. Despite diagnostic and procedural challenges highlighted in this case, early surgical intervention and comprehensive follow-up are essential for achieving favorable outcomes and minimizing recurrence risks in patients with small bowel NETs."

This study aims to delineate disparities in presentation, management, and outcomes between elderly patients and younger adults suffering from acute appendicitis. This subgroup analysis forms part of ESTES SnapAppy, a time-bound multi-center prospective, observational cohort study. It includes patients aged 15 years and above who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy during a defined 90-day observational period across multiple centers. Statistical comparisons were performed using appropriate tests with significance set at p < 0.05. The study cohort comprised 521 elderly patients (≥65 years) and 4,092 younger adults (18-64 years). Elderly patients presented later (mean duration of symptoms: 7.88 vs. 3.56 days; p < 0.001) and frequently required computed tomography (CT) scans for diagnosis (86.1% vs. 54.0%; p < 0.001).

The authors present the case of a 44-year-old female with both diseases occurring simultaneously. A 44-year-old female without relevant prior medical history, presented to the emergency room with intense abdominal pain in all four quadrants, on superficial and deep palpation. Imaging studies were conducted revealing the presence of a distended stomach filled with contrast and free air in the abdomen. An endoscopy was conducted looking for an obstruction of the gastric content and a laparotomy for the presence of a perforation on the viscera; both were ruled out. Although surgical intervention is not necessary on a patient presenting either with GP or spontaneous idiopathic pneumoperitoneum, given the clinical presentation and image studies of this patient with the finding of free air in the abdomen, a distended stomach filled with contrast and severe abdominal pain, it was decided to perform a laparotomy looking for a possible source and avoid complications of a possible blockage and/or perforation in the gastrointestinal tract. First-time cases pose a challenge for physicians at the moment of deciding on the best treatment option for the patient, especially with low-frequency pathologies."

    "title": "Is reoperation required for patients presenting with hepatic portal venous gas after gastrointestinal surgery: a review of the literature.",
    "abstract": "Hepatic portal venous gas(HPVG) represents a rare radiographic phenomenon frequently linked to intestinal necrosis, historically deemed to need immediate surgical intervention. The pivotal query arises about the imperative of urgent surgery when a patient manifests HPVG after gastrointestinal surgery. This inquiry seeks to elucidate whether emergent surgical measures remain a requisite in such cases. The investigation into 14 cases of HPVG after gastrointestinal procedures was conducted through a comprehensive review of relevant literature. This methodological approach contributes to a nuanced understanding of HPVG occurrences following gastrointestinal surgery, informing clinical considerations and potential therapeutic strategies. Among the 14 patients, 12 recovered and 2 died. 6 patients underwent surgical exploration, 4 with negative findings and recovered. 8 cases received conservative treatment, resulting in improvement for 5, and 1 initially treated conservatively, revealed perforation during later surgical exploration, leading to improvement, 1 case ended in mortality. After gastrointestinal surgery, in Computed Tomography (CT) imaging, the coexistence of HPVG and gastrointestinal dilatation, without signs of peritoneal irritation on abdominal examination, may suggest HPVG due to acute gastrointestinal injury, intestinal gas, and displacement of gas-producing bacteria. These patients can be managed conservatively under close supervision. In cases where HPVG coexists with gastrointestinal dilatation and Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) without signs of peritoneal irritation, conservative treatment may be continued under close supervision. However, if progressive exacerbation occurs despite close monitoring and the aforementioned treatments, timely surgical exploration is deemed necessary. When HPVG is combined with signs of peritoneal irritation, prompt laparotomy and exploration are preferred."

    "abstract": "Abdominal pain in patients with significant alcohol use and smoking history presents diagnostic challenges due to overlapping clinical features of complications like acute cholecystitis and peptic ulcers. The unreliable physical examinations of intoxicated patients often complicate accurate diagnosis. We present a case of a 56-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and smoking, who presented to the emergency department with nonspecific abdominal pain. Initial imaging suggested cholecystitis, but due to the patient's intoxication, his physical examination was unreliable. During a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a perforated prepyloric ulcer was unexpectedly discovered, sealed by the gallbladder. This case highlights the limitations of relying solely on imaging for diagnosing abdominal conditions in intoxicated patients. The intraoperative discovery of the perforated ulcer necessitated a shift in the surgical approach, emphasizing the need for flexibility in surgical planning and a high index of suspicion for other abdominal pathologies in patients with significant lifestyle risks. The successful management of this patient through adaptive surgical techniques and comprehensive postoperative care, including Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy, underscores the importance of maintaining a broad differential diagnosis and readiness to adapt surgical plans. This approach is essential for managing complex cases effectively, ensuring that both the immediate surgical issues and underlying causes are addressed to optimize recovery and prevent recurrence."

    "abstract": "It is important to note that prevention of button battery ingestion is the most effective way to reduce its incidence and complications. This is unachievable without providing educational plans for parents. Moreover, triage nurses and first-line staff who take the history of patients and physicians should take the history to evaluate the risk of battery ingestion. Plain radiographs can be helpful in this matter, as the presence of \"Hallow\" and \"Steep\" signs in the anteroposterior and lateral views, respectively, can help. Foreign body ingestion is a relatively common occurrence in pediatrics, especially among children 1-3 years of age. Although most cases are benign and managed conservatively, those with high-risk subjects such as button batterie can bring about fatal conditions in the minority of cases. In the present study, the history, diagnostic, and therapeutic procedures of a 13-month-old baby with the final diagnosis of button battery ingestion are presented. The parents ignored the symptoms, suspecting that it was a viral infection. The evaluations showed that a battery was lodged in the middle part of the thoracic esophagus, which was removed by an urgent endoscopic procedure. The patient was under observation and on a nothing-by-mouth diet for a week, receiving nutritional fluid with a nasogastric tube. The necrosis, which was obvious after the removal of the battery, was healing in the second control esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed 1 week after the procedure. The stricture was minimal, and no need for dilation was diagnosed. This case report underscores the importance of a timely diagnosis and removal of these cases. This case underscores the importance of the timely presentation of these cases to health care and the risk of delayed removal, such as necrosis, forming fistula, and perforation of the esophagus. The delay can cause necrosis, fistula, and perforation and might lead to irreversible severe complications and even death."

    "abstract": "Bowel obstructions are one of the main causes of hospital admissions for acute abdominal pain. In addition, bladder cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. This said, bowel obstruction and bladder cancer are very frequent diseases but the same cannot be said about the association between these two pathologies. We report a unique case of an 80-year-old patient admitted to the emergency room with a bowel obstruction caused by a urothelial carcinoma with adrenal metastasis. The patient underwent an urgent laparotomy, and intraoperative inspection of the peritoneal cavity confirmed a large tumorous mass suspected of gastrointestinal etiology. The mass infiltrated the ileum and sigmoid colon and was apparently in contact with the bladder wall. An en-bloc resection of the lesion was performed. An R0 excison was not possible and fragments of the lesion were excised from the bladder wall for separate analysis. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen described a high-grade, undifferentiated urothelial carcinoma that originated in the bladder and invaded the ileum and sigmoid colon. The presence of an invasive urothelial carcinoma presenting with bowel obstruction represents an unexpected diagnosis and, although rare, the surgeon must be aware of this possibility. This case should serve as a reminder that a broad differential diagnosis should be considered when investigating an abdominal tumor."

    "abstract": "Ventriculoperitoneal shunts (VPSs) are frequently employed in neurosurgery to treat hydrocephalus, with a particular focus on pediatric patients. Although VPSs are commonly utilized, they are not exempt from difficulties, such as shunt extrusion. The main aim of this study is to enhance comprehension regarding the occurrence, causes contributing to, and consequences of VPS extrusion in pediatric patients. A comprehensive search approach was implemented, including electronic databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus, to locate pertinent articles published between January 1950 and May 2023. The utilization of keywords such as \"ventriculoperitoneal shunt\" and \"extrusion,\" \"ventriculoperitoneal shunt\" and \"migration,\" and \"ventriculoperitoneal shunt\" and \"perforation\" was employed. Data on patient demographics, underlying diseases, origin of extrusion, presenting symptoms, treatment, and follow-up were gathered. Statistical studies were conducted to identify potential risk factors connected with the occurrence of shunt extrusion. A study analyzed 80 studies on 120 individuals with extruded VPS catheters. The majority of patients (55.8%) had symptoms such as cerebrospinal fluid leakage and irritation. Hydrocephalus was categorized into congenital (40%), obstructive (36.7%), and communicating (11.7%) groups. Catheter extrusion sites varied, with most from the anal or rectal site. Preoperative meningitis or peritonitis was present in 20% of patients. Treatments ranged from shunt removal to endoscopic third ventriculostomy, resulting in a 90% recovery rate, 1.7% mortality, and 5% follow-up loss. Extrusion of the distal catheter in VPSs is a critical medical situation that necessitates urgent surgical intervention. The presence of an infection raises the likelihood of complications; hence, it is vital to promptly address the issue through the administration of antibiotics and the replacement of the shunt. Timely intervention enhances results."

    "abstract": "Medial clavicle fractures and injuries to the sternoclavicular joint are rare injuries but can have life-threatening consequences. There are no standardized treatment algorithms or guidelines for the diagnostics and treatment. This article provides an overview of the individual topographies as well as the conservative and surgical treatment strategies.Conservative treatment is preferred for medial clavicle fractures. The indications for surgical treatment are variable but this is frequently carried out if there is a fracture displacement > 1 cm or 1 shaft width and high functional demands. In the case of accompanying injuries to neurovascular structures, an open fracture or the threat of perforation of the skin, surgical treatment is mandatory. Open reduction and internal fixation using (locking) plates is currently the preferred form of treatment.In the case of posterior dislocation of the sternoclavicular joint, an immediate closed reduction must be attempted with the patient under analgosedation and with emergency treatment on standby. This temporal urgency does not exist for anterior and superior dislocations. Surgical treatment is indicated in cases of unsuccessful reduction, persistent symptomatic instability or injuries of the neurovascular bundle. From a multitude of treatment options, arthrodesis with suture cerclage has shown good results. Tendon grafts as well as special hook plates are increasingly being used due to better biomechanical qualities. The surgical treatment of combined injuries is determined by the individual injury pattern.Despite the variety of treatment strategies, the long-term outcome has consistently been positively described. Mediale Klavikulafrakturen und Verletzungen des Sternoklavikulargelenks sind selten, können jedoch lebensbedrohliche Folgen haben. Standardisierte Behandlungsalgorithmen oder Leitlinien zu Diagnostik und Therapie existieren nicht. Dieser Beitrag gibt einen Überblick zu den einzelnen Topografien und ihrer sowohl operativen als auch konservativen Versorgung.Mediale Klavikulafrakturen werden überwiegend konservativ behandelt. Die Indikationsstellung zur operativen Versorgung variiert, erfolgt jedoch häufig bei Frakturdislokationen > 1 cm bzw. einer Schaftbreite und hohem funktionellen Anspruch. Absolute Versorgungsindikationen stellen begleitende Verletzungen neurovaskulärer Strukturen, offene Fraktur oder eine drohende Perforation der Haut dar. Bevorzugt wird mittlerweile die offene Reposition und interne Fixierung mithilfe der (winkelstabilen) Plattenosteosynthese.Bei posterioren Luxationen im Sternoklavikulargelenk muss eine geschlossene Reposition unter Analgosedierung/in Versorgungsbereitschaft unmittelbar versucht werden. Diese zeitliche Dringlichkeit besteht nicht bei anterioren oder superioren Luxationen. Eine operative Therapie ist bei frustraner Reposition, anhaltender symptomatischer Instabilität oder bei Verletzungen des neurovaskulären Bündels indiziert. Aus mannigfaltigen Versorgungsoptionen hat sich die Arthrodese mit Faden-Cerclagen bewährt. Aufgrund besserer biologischer Eigenschaften werden zunehmend Sehnentransplantate verwendet. Bei Kombinationsverletzungen wird das operative Verfahren durch die einzelnen Verletzungsmuster festgelegt.Trotz der Vielseitigkeit der therapeutischen Strategien wird das langfristige Outcome durchweg positiv beschrieben."

    "abstract": "In patients with acute left-sided colonic obstruction, stenting can convert an emergency operation into a semi-elective procedure. However, its use continues to be debated. We performed a cost-effective analysis using our institution's experiences. Endoscopic, surgical, and financial details were prospectively collected for patients who presented with acute colonic obstruction and underwent stenting between 2019 and 2022. Outcomes were defined as technical/clinical success and successful surgical resection. The financial cost of stenting was compared with the expected cost without stenting. Forty patients were included, with 29 undergoing definitive resection. The most common pathology was primary colon cancer (27 patients, 93%). Endoscopic stenting had high technical (90%) and clinical (83%) success rates, with low rates of complications such as perforation (2 patients, 7%) and migration (0 patients, 0%). As a bridge to surgery, the median procedure time was 226 minutes and the surgical outcomes also showed a low rate of complications (3 patients, 11%), such as anastomotic leakage (0 patients, 0%), intraabdominal abscesses (2 patients, 7%), and 30-day postoperative mortality (0 patients, 0%). The cumulative costs with colonic stenting were $32,900, while the expected costs with emergency surgery, including stoma reversal, were $40,700 (healthcare cost-savings of $7,800 per person). The difference was mainly due to the avoidance of upfront emergency surgery. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 0.81, favoring colonic stenting over upfront emergency surgery. Colonic stenting as a bridge to surgery is safe and cost-effective for treating left-sided colonic obstruction with high success rates and low complication rates."

A video dataset for normal appendix and appendicitis in children using ED PoCUS images was developed to assess interobserver agreement, as measured by Cohen's Kappa on key sonographic findings. Three sets of 25 ED PoCUS videos were selected and curated from pediatric patients with normal appendix and acute appendicitis. Four participant ED sonologist-physicians were trained on the first set of 25 videos showing normal appendix or normal bowel in patients without appendicitis to note if normal appendix was seen in any part or in it's entirety from tip-to-cecum. They were then tested on the second set of similar videos. A third set of 25 videos from patients who had appendicitis where participant sonologists were asked to note if appendicitis was present or absent, with and without appendicolith or perforation. Cohen's Kappa was calculated in aggregate and stratified by experience vs. novice against a senior sonologist-physician aware of all patient outcomes for visualization of: 1. any part of normal appendix, 2. normal appendix visualized from tip to cecum 3. any part of appendicitis, 4. appendicolith, 5. appendiceal perforation.

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction (SBO) accounts for a substantial proportion of emergency surgical admissions. Malignancy is a common cause of obstruction, either due to a primary tumour or intra-abdominal metastases. However, little is known regarding the current treatment or outcomes of patients with malignant SBO. This study aimed to characterise the treatment of malignant SBO and identify areas for potential improvement and compare overall survival of patients with malignant SBO to patients with non-malignant SBO. This was a subgroup analysis of a multicentre observational study of patients admitted with SBO. Details regarding these patients' diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes up to 1-year after admission were recorded. The primary outcome was overall survival in patients with malignant SBO. A total of 316 patients with small bowel obstruction were included, of whom 33 (10.4%) had malignant SBO. Out of the 33 patients with malignant SBO, 20 patients (60.6%) were treated with palliative intent although only 7 patients were seen by a palliative team during admission. Nutritional assessments were performed on 12 patients, and 11 of these patients received parenteral nutrition. 23 patients underwent surgery, with the most common surgical interventions being loop ileostomies (9 patients) and gastrointestinal bypasses (9 patients). 4 patients underwent right hemicolectomies, with a primary anastomosis formed and 1 patient had a right hemicolectomy with a terminal ileostomy. Median survival was 114 days, and no difference was seen in survival between patients treated with or without palliative intent. Malignant SBO is associated with significant risks of short-term complications and a poor prognosis. Consideration should be given to the early involvement of senior decision-makers upon patient admission is essential for optimal management and setting expectation for a realistic outcome."

We describe a case of bacteremia caused by F. plautii in a mildly immunocompromised patient with acute generalized peritonitis. The patient is an 83-year-old male, with a history of stage III hepatocellular carcinoma 11 months prior, stage I gastric cancer, and cerebral infarction three months prior. He visited the emergency room of our hospital with a chief complaint of right-sided abdominal pain. A partial resection of the colon was performed due to stenosis of the transverse colon. Due to increasing abdominal pain, the patient underwent surgery for acute generalized peritonitis on the 11th postoperative day. F. plautii was detected in blood cultures collected prior to surgery, and the patient was treated with piperacillin/tazobactam 2.25 g four times a day for 11 days. The patient resumed eating and was discharged with no recurrence. This species may also stain gram-negative, and caution should be exercised in reporting results due to the potential impact on initial antimicrobial therapy. Gram staining showed variation in the length of the bacterium, which is considered a characteristic of this species. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy for F. plautii has yet to be established, and further accumulation of cases is needed to understand the resistance mechanism and confirm the effectiveness of different antimicrobials."

Liver hemangioma is the most frequent benign liver tumor, and they rarely lead to symptoms or complications. Case Presentation. We describe the case of an 81-year-old man with hemorrhagic shock due to an atraumatic rupture of a hepatic hemangioma while on oral anticoagulation. The patient presented to the emergency department after three episodes of syncope before admission, nausea, vomiting, mild epigastric abdominal pain, but with clinical signs of peritonitis. On admission, the patient had a mild tachycardia with a heart rate of 107/min and a blood pressure of 102/83 mmHg. Initial hemoglobin was 122 g/L, and lactate was slightly elevated (2.5 mmol/L). Bedside sonography revealed free intraabdominal fluid. The subsequent computed tomography showed a ruptured hemangioma of the liver with ongoing hemorrhage. After the CT scan, the patient became increasingly tachycardic and the blood pressure dropped to 94/62 mmHg. After administration of blood products and intravenous fluids, the patient responded with improved hemodynamics and was transferred to angiology for emergency embolization. After the intervention, the patient spent two days in the intermediate care unit and was discharged after 10 days of hospitalization. Atraumatic rupture of a hemangioma with consecutive hemorrhagic shock is extremely rare. In selected cases of spontaneously ruptured hemangiomas with hemoperitoneum, endovascular embolization can be an alternative to surgery. Furthermore, this case emphasizes the importance of sonographic examination as an additional diagnostic tool in syncope and concomitant abdominal pain."

However, the association between US and computed tomography (CT) utilization remains unclear. We aimed to determine how increased US utilization correlated with the rate of CT evaluation of pediatric acute appendicitis. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the 2019 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample. Eligible patients were aged less than 18 y with a diagnosis of appendicitis. Imaging was determined by Current Procedural Terminology codes. Concurrent imaging was defined as US and CT use during the same encounter. We calculated the hospital rate of concurrent imaging and categorized hospitals into tertiles: low (< 20%), medium (20%-40%), and high (> 40%). We developed generalized ordinal logistic regression models with inverse probability weighting to assess patient characteristics and hospital rates of concurrent imaging associations. Our analysis included 485 hospitals and 23,976 patients. Thirty four percent were treated at hospitals in the lowest, 35% at the middle, and 31% at the highest tertile hospitals. We observed a negative correlation (-0.27, P < 0.001) between increasing US use and concurrent imaging use. The odds of presenting to a higher concurrent imaging rate hospital were significantly lower for Blacks (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] [95% confidence interval {CI}]: 0.6, [0.4-0.9]) and Hispanics (aOR [95% CI]: 0.7 [0.5-0.9]) in comparison to Whites. The odds of presenting to a higher concurrent imaging rate hospital were higher for patients in the second (aOR [95% CI]: 1.9 [1.2-3.2]) and lowest income quartile (aOR [95% CI]: 3.7 [1.1-13.1]) compared to the highest income quartile. Increased US use correlated with decreased CT utilization for diagnosing appendicitis.

The coexistence of a Meckel's diverticulum and carcinoid tumor following laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy for diverticulitis is an uncommon phenomenon, with limited documented cases in the literature. We present a case of a 74-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension and diverticulitis who underwent a laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy for dysplastic and cancerous changes of a polyp revealed during a screening colonoscopy. Initially, the patient's postoperative journey was uneventful with the resumption of regular bowel movements and favorable diet progression. However, he later presented to the emergency department for worsening abdominal pain and distension. Imaging prompted surgical intervention due to perforation and obstruction, resulting in the identification of a carcinoid tumor within a perforated Meckel's diverticulum. This case highlights the intricate challenges of postoperative complications, particularly the unexpected emergence of Meckel's diverticulum pathology following a colectomy. The atypical presentation, featuring a carcinoid tumor within a perforated Meckel's diverticulum, underscores the importance of evaluating abdominal symptoms postoperatively."

We aimed to investigate associations between language barriers and delays in assessment and treatment for adults with acute appendicitis. In a multiethnic community, patients aged ≥18 years old who underwent appendectomy were identified between January 2017 and August 2022 at a single institution. Negative binomial regression was used to compare interval wait times to imaging, medication administration, and surgical evaluation between patients with limited English proficiency and those who are English proficient. Of the 1469 patients included, 48% (n = 699) were with limited English proficiency. Average age was higher for patients with limited English proficiency (45 vs 36, P < .001). Most of them were Asian (54%) and without private insurance (65%, P < .001). Symptom duration, incidence of septic shock, and date/time of presentation to the emergency department were similar. Patients with limited English proficiency presented more frequently with gangrenous appendicitis (20% vs 15%, P = .013) but not perforated (23% vs 20%, P = .065). They experienced longer wait times for surgical evaluation (376 vs 348 min, incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.08; P = .002) but similar times for imaging, and medications administered. After controlling for demographics, triage acuity, and hospital factors, significantly longer wait times for surgical evaluation persisted (IRR adjusted, 1.07; P = .038). There was no significant difference in hospital length-of-stay, postoperative infection, or 30-day readmission rate. Adult patients with limited English proficiency may experience longer wait times for surgical evaluation for acute appendicitis, but this may not result in clinically significant delays in the initiation of treatment."

We report a rare case of mixed intestinal hemangioma (IH) causing intussusception in a pediatric patient. A 3-month-old girl, with no prior medical or surgical history, was admitted with rectal bleeding and paroxysmal crying due to intermittent abdominal pain. An urgent abdominal ultrasound revealed ileo-ileal intussusception. Operative findings confirmed the intussusception, and a segmental resection of the intussuscepted jejunum was performed. Histopathological examination found a mixed hemangioma. The postoperative course was uneventful. Clinical presentation may include intestinal bleeding leading to anemia, obstruction, intussusception and perforation. Intussusception caused by small bowel hemangioma is extremely rare. Notably, we didn't find any cases of small bowel hemangioma revealed by intussusception in children. The main treatment for hemangiomas is surgical resection of the affected segment. No evidence in the literature on postoperative recurrence of hemangiomas. Intussusception secondary to intestinal hemangiomas is extremely rare. Preoperative diagnosis is challenging as they are often undetectable with traditional techniques. Enhanced awareness and understanding of this condition can facilitate earlier diagnosis and improve management outcomes."

We describe a case of pembrolizumab related perforated appendicitis in a patient with stage 3C malignant melanoma (MM). A 70-year-old male patient who had no known disease was diagnosed with MM as a result of the excision of the mass on his right shoulder. The disease stage was stage 3C (pT4aN1bM0). Subsequently, adjuvant pembrolizumab treatment was started. A few days after the fourth maintenance course, he presented to the emergency department complaining of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Emergency abdominal tomography showed a significant increase in the diameter of the appendix vermiformis, peritoneal thickening and appendiceal wall defects that could be significant in terms of perforation. The mentioned finding and given the clinical presentation, was attributed to a perporating of the appendix, so the patient was hospitalized in the Department of Surgery and the patient underwent emergency appendectomy. Histological findings were consistent with appendicitis. After a day in the hospital, the abdominal pain subsided, C-reactive protein tended to decrease and the patient was discharged. In patients who develop acute abdominal pain with or without diarrhea during immunotherapy, urgent imaging, endoscopic and clinical evaluation should be performed, and bowel perforation, although rare, should be considered as a potential complication of any immunotherapy."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency. It is commonly caused by obstruction of the appendiceal lumen due to fecaliths, tumors, or lymphoid hyperplasia. For over a century, appendectomy has been the primary treatment for acute appendicitis. Abraham Groves performed the first open appendectomy in 1883. In 1983, Kurt Semm completed the first laparoscopic appendectomy, heralding a new era in appendectomy. However, appendectomy is associated with certain complications and a rate of negative appendectomies. Studies have suggested controversy over the impact of appendectomy on the development of inflammatory bowel disease and Parkinson's disease, but an increasing number of studies indicate a possible positive correlation between appendectomy and colorectal cancer, gallstones, and cardiovascular disease. With the recognition that the appendix is not a vestigial organ and the advancement of endoscopic te-chnology, Liu proposed the endoscopic retrograde appendicitis therapy. It is an effective minimally invasive alternative for treating uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Our team has developed an appendoscope with a disposable digital imaging system operated through the biopsy channel of a colonoscope and successfully applied it in the treatment of appendicitis. This article provides an overview of the progress in endoscopic treatment for acute appendicitis and offers a new perspective on the future direction of appendiceal disease treatment."

    "abstract": "Protein S deficiency resulting in mesenteric vein thrombosis has been reported in previous studies however those causing SMA thrombosis has been rarely reported. Multidisciplinary approach involving general surgeon, a vascular surgeon, an interventional radiologist, and an intensivist are crucial for management of SMA thrombosis. A 39-year-old non-smoker hypertensive female who was diagnosed with partially occlusive thrombus in the superior mesenteric artery via Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) re-presented after 5 days and CECT revealed a partially occlusive thrombus in the superior mesenteric artery and Protein S deficiency (free protein S:15 %). She was managed by lysis of thrombus with streptokinase by interventional radiology team. The patient is on anticoagulants and without abdominal complaints on follow-up at 24 months. Computed tomography angiography should be done immediately in any patient suspected of AMI since delay in diagnosis accounts for high mortality rates of 30-70 %. The surgical treatment of the condition is well established and consists of revascularization and/or resection of nonviable bowel. Endovascular techniques have emerged as an alternative for occlusion of the SMA. Patients with protein C and/or S deficiency treated for AMI require lifelong anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy to prevent relapse. Hereditary thrombophilia should be suspected in young people with unusual thrombotic presentations. Earlier diagnosis and aggressive antithrombotic therapy in individuals with hypercoagulable states can improve outcomes. Treatment involving a multidisciplinary approach improves outcomes."

    "title": "Gastric perforation as a complication of Wilkie's syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Wilkie's syndrome, also known as Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome, is characterized by intestinal obstruction due to aortomesenteric duodenal compression caused by the reduction of the normal angle between (38-65º) to <25º or to a distance <8mm. The clinical presentation is usually non-specific (dyspepsia, postprandial abdominal pain) but sometimes presented as an acute intestinal obstruction syndrome (nausea, vomiting, gastric dilatation and abdominal distention). In this study, we report the case of a 22-year-old patient with a BMI of 16.5 who presented to the emergency room with acute intestinal obstruction caused by SAMS. He presented with massive gastric dilation that caused ischaemic necrosis of the gastric mucosa with subsequent perforation. It should be noted that only one case associated with Wilkie syndrome has been described in the literature. Therefore, given the rare incidence of complications associated with this syndrome and the favourable prognosis with conservative management, surgery is usually the last line of treatment. However, we must not forget that when necrosis appears, it is often extensive and requires urgent surgical treatment in most cases."

    "abstract": "Fertility-preserving surgery (FPS) in advanced ovarian cancer (AOC) is extremely rare and consequently, information about the pregnancies of these patients is anecdotal. Therefore, management of the pregnancy after AOC is challenging, especially if an unexpected situation arises. A 31-year-old nulliparous woman was admitted to our tertiary hospital in the 18th week of twin pregnancy with sudden severe abdominal pain. Her medical history included a low-grade AOC stage IIIc diagnosed 2 years before pregnancy and treated by debulking FPS and systemic therapy with carboplatin/paclitaxel and bevacizumab. Clinical examination described normal vital signs and peritoneal irritation without any vaginal discharge. Sonography revealed free fluid in the pouch of Douglas and intact twin pregnancy. Laboratory work showed elevated leukocytes with neutrophilia. To evaluate appendicitis magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen was indicated. This revealed a uterine rupture with the now extra-cavitary position of the twins. Simultaneously, the patient's symptoms deteriorated, and emergency surgery was necessary where hemoperitoneum with avital fetuses were present. Despite excessive blood loss the uterus could be repaired and preserved. Previous resection of the uterine serosa during her debulking FPS, administration of bevacizumab affecting smooth muscles, and overstretching the uterus in the twin pregnancy were considered as possible risk factors for the presenting uterine rupture. Pregnancy after AOC is possible but should be monitored closely, especially due to the hidden long-term consequences of its therapy. In the differential diagnosis of sudden abdominal pain during pregnancy uterine rupture should be considered even in patients with an unscared uterus."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis (AA) is one of the most common reasons for visiting the emergency room. The lack of proper diagnosis and rapid treatment of AA may lead to severe complications such as intestinal perforation and increased mortality. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the Alvarado criteria, ultrasound, and CRP criteria in comparison with their combined use in patients with suspected AA who presented to the emergency room. In this diagnostic accuracy study, 1411 patients with suspected AA who presented to the emergency department of Firoozabadi Hospital affiliated with Iran University of Medical Sciences and underwent appendectomy from October 2019 to October 2021 were examined. Nine hundred eighty-eight patients were enrolled. All patients were assessed using Alvarado, CRP, and ultrasound. The definitive diagnosis of AA was based on pathological findings and was considered the gold standard. Statistical analyses were performed with STATA VER 11.5. The diagnostic accuracy for each group was compared using the Pearson chi-square test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The mean age was 29.57 ± 13.66 years. The sensitivity and specificity of Alvarado in the diagnostic accuracy of appendicectomy were 75.2% and 61.3% (CI = 95%), respectively. The sensitivity of ultrasound and CRP for predicting appendicitis was significantly higher than the Alvarado criteria. The diagnostic accuracy for CRP was significantly higher than ultrasound (64.9% vs. 60.7%, P: 0.003). The diagnostic accuracy of the simultaneous use of Alvarado + CRP and CRP + Ultrasound was significantly higher than that of Alvarado + ultrasound. The sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of the simultaneous use of all three criteria together (Alvarado + Ultrasound + CRP) were estimated to be 94.9%, 25.8%, and 81.5% (CI = 95%), respectively, which were significantly higher than the use of other criteria. This study showed that the Alvarado criteria had inadequate diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy for diagnosing acute appendicitis. The diagnostic accuracy of acute appendicitis increases to over 90% using the three Alvarado, ultrasound, and CRP criteria at the same time."

    "abstract": "The simultaneous diagnosis of severe aortic regurgitation and aortic root pseudoaneurysm resulting from traffic injury is extremely rare. This report presents the case of a patient with Marfan syndrome who experienced aortic root pseudoaneurysm and subacute severe aortic regurgitation following a traffic accident. A 64-year-old woman was diagnosed with Marfan syndrome 16 years ago and is undergoing ongoing follow-up at an outpatient clinic. Eight years previously, the patient underwent total arch replacement combined with J-graft open stent graft® (JGOS; Japan Lifeline Co., Tokyo, Japan) deployment for acute type A dissection. Five months before presentation, the patient suffered a left rib fracture in a traffic accident and received conservative management at a local hospital. The patient presented to the emergency room with worsening shortness of breath and orthopnea. Echocardiography revealed severe aortic regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Computed tomography revealed new-onset pseudoaneurysm at the aortic root. Surgical repair was successfully performed using a modified Bentall procedure with a bioprosthetic valve and tricuspid annuloplasty. Intraoperative findings revealed pseudoaneurysm with perforation of the right sinus of Valsalva. Although the left and right aortic valve leaflets were normal, the noncoronary leaflet exhibited a ruptured fibrous strand of a cusp fenestration, resulting in acute aortic regurgitation. This case report highlights the rare occurrence of aortic root pseudoaneurysm and subacute aortic regurgitation following a traffic accident. In cases of blunt chest trauma, particularly in patients with Marfan syndrome, frequent examination is crucial to assess the possibility of posttraumatic aortic regurgitation and aortic injury."

    "abstract": "Long-term outcomes in patients undergoing emergency versus elective resection for colorectal cancer (CRC) remain controversial. This study aims to assess short- and long-term outcomes of emergency versus elective CRC surgery. In this single-center retrospective cohort study, patients undergoing emergency or elective colonic resections for CRC from January 2013 to December 2017 were included. Primary outcome was long-term survival. As secondary outcomes, we sought to analyze potential differences on postoperative morbidity and concerning the oncological standard of surgical resection. The Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard model were used to compare survival between the groups. Overall, 225 CRC patients were included. Of these 192 (85.3%) had an elective and 33 (14.7%) an emergency operation. Emergency indications were due to obstruction, perforation, or bleeding. Patients in the emergency group had higher ASA score (p = 0.023), higher Charlsson comorbidity index (CCI, p = 0.012), and were older than those in the elective group, with median age 70 (IQR 63-79) years and 78 (IQR 68-83) years, for elective and emergency, respectively (p = 0.020). No other preoperative differences were observed. Patients in the emergency group experienced significantly more major complications (12.1% vs. 3.6%, p = 0.037), more anastomotic leakage (12.1% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.001), need for reoperation (12.1% vs. 3.1%, p = 0.021), and postoperative mortality (2 patients vs. 0, p < 0.001). No differences in terms of final pathological stage, nor in accuracy of lymphadenectomy were observed. Overall survival was significantly worse in case of emergency operation, with estimated median 41 months vs. not reached in elective cases (p < 0.001). At the multivariate analysis, emergency operation was confirmed as independent unfavorable determinant of survival (with hazard rate HR = 1.97, p = 0.028), together with age (HR = 1.05, p < 0.001), postoperative major morbidity (HR = 3.18, p = 0.012), advanced stage (HR = 5.85, p < 0.001), and need for transfusion (HR = 2.10, p = 0.049). Postoperative morbidity and mortality were increased in emergency versus elective CRC resections. Despite no significant differences in terms of accuracy of resection and pathological stages, overall survival was significantly worse in patients who underwent emergency procedure, and independent of other determinants of survival."

    "abstract": "Appendicectomy is the most frequently performed emergency general surgical procedure. Previous research has highlighted discrepancies between initial intraoperative laparoscopic diagnoses and subsequent histopathology reports following appendicectomy. In the United Kingdom (UK), routine histopathological examination is the established practice, ensuring precise diagnosis of appendiceal specimens. This retrospective analysis aims to compare intraoperative laparoscopic assessments of the appendix with corresponding histopathology findings. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 418 consecutive emergency laparoscopic appendectomies at Peterborough City Hospital in the UK between April 2018 and June 2019 for suspected appendicitis. Intraoperative findings were compared with histopathological examination outcomes using kappa statistics. Of the 418 appendectomies analysed, we found a substantial agreement between surgeons and pathologists (kappa = 0.71, P < 0.001) in detecting overall abnormalities of appendices. This agreement was also high for detecting inflamed appendices (kappa = 0.72, P < 0.001). However, of the six neoplastic lesions confirmed in the pathologists' final report, only two were suspected during laparoscopy. While laparoscopic assessments of the appendix demonstrate a statistically significant and improved agreement with histopathological findings in detecting abnormal and inflamed appendices, the ability of surgeons to identify neoplasia appears suboptimal based on our small sample of neoplasia cases. The data strongly support the continued practice of routine histopathological examination following appendicectomy due to its crucial role in avoiding missed diagnoses and ensuring better patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Up to 30% of patients with colorectal cancer present as an emergency and have worse outcomes than elective patients. Compared with left-sided cancers, malignancies arising in the right colon are significantly under-researched. We sought to compare cancer care quality and clinical outcomes between emergency and elective presentations of right-sided colon cancer (RCC). This multicentre, retrospective study included all patients who underwent operative management for a RCC, from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2022. Data were collected from electronic patient records, and host and tumour factors as well as outcomes between emergency and elective cohorts were compared. Overall, 806 patients (median age 72 years) were included. Some 175 patients (22%) presented as an emergency: 140 in obstruction and 35 with tumour perforation, compared with 1 patient with tumour perforation in the elective group (p < 0.001). The emergency group had higher rates of postoperative complications (59.1% vs 20.0%, p < 0.001), increased 90-day mortality (13.7% vs 1.3%, p < 0.001) and a longer hospital stay (5 vs 10 days, p < 0.001). From the emergency cohort only 29.2% of eligible patients received adjuvant chemotherapy and in multivariate regression analysis emergency presentation was associated with a decreased likelihood of receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (odds ratio 0.26 [0.14-0.47], p < 0.001). Both short- and long-term outcomes after emergency presentation of RCC are poor, with inadequate access to subsequent chemotherapy. Strategies addressing emergency presentations of left-sided tumours have moved towards temporisation and elective surgery. Delaying major resectional surgery for optimisation may improve outcomes and access to adjuvant therapies for RCC."

Our aim in this study is to describe the clinical, laboratory, and computed tomography (CT) findings to facilitate the objective identification of SBO patients in need of operative treatment in this patient population. This retrospective study included 340 patients hospitalized due to a preliminary diagnosis of ileus. Retrieved data of patients included age, gender, comorbidities, previous hospitalization due to ileus, surgical history, physical examination findings, complete blood count and biochemistry test results, and CT findings at admission. The study included 180 (52.9%) male and 160 (47.1%) female patients. Treatment was conservative in 216 patients and surgery in 124 patients. Of the patients included in the study, 36.4% needed surgery. Of the female patients, 38.90% received conservative treatment and 61.30% underwent surgery. Adhesions were the most common cause of obstruction in operated patients (43.50%). We have found that female gender, vomiting, guarding, rebound, C-reactive protein levels above 75 mg/L, increased bowel diameter, and a transition zone on CT images indicate a strong need for surgery, but a history of previous hospitalization for ileus may show that surgery may not be the best option.

    "abstract": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) predominantly affects preterm infants and can mimic other conditions like acute appendicitis. Neonatal appendicitis (NA) is extremely rare, with an incidence of 0.04-0.2% and high fatality rates. Due to its rarity and resemblance to other neonatal conditions, NA diagnosis is often delayed. We report a case of a 2220-g male preterm neonate delivered at 31 + 5 weeks via urgent cesarean section due to chorioamnionitis, initially misdiagnosed with NEC but later found to have a perforated appendix. The neonate recovered well post-surgery, with the ileostomy reversed 10 weeks later. Prompt surgical intervention is crucial for NA, as it requires different management than NEC. This case underscores the importance of considering NA in preterm infants with severe abdominal symptoms and emphasizes timely surgical intervention to improve outcomes. Additionally, it supports the hypothesis that localized NEC involving the appendix may have a better prognosis than generalized NEC."

This study seeks to report a new covered stent to treat porcine CAP, which is manufactured with DES and a biodegradable membrane fabricated by poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) polymer. Experimental swines experienced CAP in proximal-middle of right coronary artery (RCA) by non-compliant balloon burst, and covered stent was deployed in breach segment. Meanwhile, coronary angiography (CAG), optical coherence tomography (OCT), histological light microscopy and scan electron microscopy were performed to characterize the performance of covered stent. Seven swines were used for this study. Two swines were euthanasia at 14 days and 28 days after procedure, respectively. The remaining 5 kept alive until sacrifice at six months. CAG at six months showed total occlusion at the stented segment of RCA in all swines. The interventional revascularization of occlusion lesion was instituted in two swines. After recanalizing occlusion lesion, OCT examination visualized diffuse heterogeneous fibrous plaques, as well as organized thrombosis, lipid deposits and several neoatherosclerosis in the occluded segment. Serial histopathologic and electron microscopies at 14 days, 28 days and six months revealed gradual occlusive vessel lumen with diffuse heterogeneous fibroplasia, smooth muscle proliferation, inflammation response and local neoatherosclerosis, moreover with identification of PLLA polymer membrane degradability. The new covered stent with biodegradable membrane could seal urgent coronary breach and prevent experimental swines death, but with all stent occlusion in mid-term (six months) follow-up, which might be attributed to diffuse heterogeneous fibroplasia, smooth muscle proliferation, inflammation response and local neoatherosclerosis with the degradation of PLLA membrane."

The purpose of this study was to validate the Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha Appendicitis (RIPASA) scoring system in the Ethiopian context. A total of 315 consecutive patients who presented with a presumptive diagnosis of acute appendicitis and were planned to undergo appendectomy were studied. All the studied patients had diagnostic sonography and underwent the RIPASA scoring system. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of RIPASA and ultrasound results with intraoperative gross examinations. The mean age of the participants was 27.4 ± 11.5 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.6:1. The concordance between ultrasound and RIPASA for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis was 93.6%. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of RIPASA were 96.2%, 30.8%, 93.9%, and 42.1%, respectively. Similarly, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of ultrasound were 95.3%, 27.8%, 95.6%, and 26.3%, respectively. White cell count and RIPASA scores were weakly correlated with intraoperative stages of acute appendicitis, r(313) = 0.18, p = 0.001, and r(313) = 0.129, p = 0.022, respectively. The rate of a negative appendectomy was 6%. RIPASA and ultrasound had equivalent performance in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. In both cases, the rate of negative appendectomy was low enough to validate RIPASA for clinical practice in low-income institutions where sonographic diagnosis by a conventionally trained radiologist is not available."

In this retrospective single-center study, we considered all consecutive patients admitted to the ER from February 2019 to February 2023 for ASBO with an available contrast-enhanced CT scan performed at diagnosis and treated with conservative management. The investigated CT findings were type and location of transition zone, ASBO degree, fat notch sign, beak sign, small bowel feces sign, presence of peritoneal free fluid and pneumatosis intestinalis. Radiological parameters were analyzed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression to test the significant association between the CT parameters and the target. Among the 106 included patients (median age 74.5 years), conservative treatment was effective in 59 (55.7%) and failed in 47 (44.3%), needing delayed surgery. In the failure group, there was a higher prevalence of patients who had previous ASBO episodes (p = 0.03), a greater proportion of females (p = 0.04) and a longer hospital stay (p < 0.001). At multivariable analysis, two CT findings were significantly correlated with failure of conservative treatment: fat notch sign (OR = 2.95; p = 0.04) and beak sign (OR = 3.42; p = 0.04). Two radiological signs correlate with failure of non-operative management in ASBO, suggesting their importance in surgical decision-making. Patients presenting with these signs are at higher risk of unsuccessful conservative treatment and may require undelayed surgical intervention."

This hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from July 2020 to June 2022 and enrolled 88 SBO patients requiring surgical intervention. After adequately resuscitating the patients, various surgical procedures were performed based on the intraoperative conditions of the bowel. Patients were assessed postoperatively for the duration of their hospital stay, postoperative complications, and surgical recovery. There was a male preponderance (n=55), with a median age of 50 (18-90) years. Abdominal discomfort was the most frequent symptom, necessitating a hospital visit (97.9%, n= 86), followed by nausea (85.2%, n= 75), constipation (78.1%, n=69), and abdominal distension (51.1%, n=45). Ileal strictures (18.2%, n=16) were the most common etiology, followed by postoperative adhesions (14.8%, n=13) and bands (13.6%, n=12), of which 76.4% (n=9) had past surgical history. Resection and anastomosis were the most frequently performed surgical interventions in this study (36.4%, n=32), followed by stoma creation (27.3%, n=24) and adhesiolysis (17%, n=15). The postoperative 30-day mortality of 11.36% (n=10) was noted, which could be ascribed to the elderly population with comorbidity, postoperative complications, and who required extended stay in the critical care unit. Benign ileal stricture was the most common cause of acute SBO in the emergency. Prompt and timely diagnosis combined with a multidisciplinary approach and effective management can improve outcomes and reduce morbidity and mortality in adult patients with SBO."

    "abstract": "Cases of appendicitis were identified in the pivotal randomized clinical trial on BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and reported from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine pharmacovigilance systems. Three cohort studies and two self-controlled case series (SCCS) studies evaluating the association between mRNA vaccines and appendicitis reported discordant results. To address this uncertainty, the present study examines in a large population, with a SCCS design, the association between mRNA (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273) and, for the first time, viral vector (ChAdOx1-S and Ad26.COV2-S) COVID-19 vaccines and acute appendicitis. The SCCS study design was used to evaluate the association between COVID-19 vaccination and subsequent onset of acute appendicitis. The study was based on record linkage of health archives through TheShinISS application, a statistical tool that locally processes data from regional health care databases according to ad hoc, study-tailored and common data model. The study population included all vaccinated subjects ≥ 12 years old between 27 December 2020 and 30 September 2021. The acute appendicitis was identified through discharge diagnoses of hospital admissions or emergency department visits. Incident cases were defined as those who experienced a first event of acute appendicitis in the study period, excluding subjects with a diagnosis of appendicitis in the previous 5 years. Exposure was defined as the first or second dose of BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 and ChAdOx1-S and the single dose of Ad26.COV2-S. The risk interval was defined as 42 days from the first or second vaccination dose and divided into pre-specified risk subperiods; the reference period was the observation time outside the risk interval. Relative incidences (RI) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated with the SCCS method 'modified for event-dependent exposures', through unbiased estimating equations. The seasonal component was considered as a time-dependent covariate. In the 42-day risk interval 1285 incident cases of acute appendicitis occurred: 727 cases after the first dose and 558 cases after the second dose. In the main analysis, no increased risks of acute appendicitis were observed in subjects vaccinated with BNT162b, mRNA-1273, ChAdOx1-S and Ad26.COV2-S. The subgroup analyses by sex showed an increased risk in the 14-27 day risk interval, in males after the first dose of mRNA-1273 (RI of 1.71; 95% CI 1.08-2.70, p = 0.02) and in females after the single dose of Ad26.COV2-S (RI of 4.40; 95% CI 1.29-15.01, p = 0.02). There was no evidence of association of BNT162b, ChAdOx1-S, mRNA-1273 and Ad26.COV2-S with acute appendicitis in the general population. The results of the subgroup analyses by sex needs to be considered with caution. The multiplicity issue cannot be excluded being these hypotheses two of several hypotheses tested. In addition, relevant literature on the biological mechanism of the disease and evidence of similar effects with other vaccines or with the same vaccines are still lacking to provide strong support for a conclusion that there is an harmful effect in males and females with mRNA-1273 and Ad26.COV2-S."

    "title": "Presentation and management of post-esophagectomy or Gastrectomy Hiatal Hernia.",
    "abstract": "Hiatal hernia may development after esophagectomy or Gastrectomy. Post- esophago-gastric hiatal hernia is a rare but challenging condition. Nearly half of reported cases involve emergent situations, underscoring the urgency of addressing this condition. However, there is currently no consensus on the optimal treatment approach for this type of hernia. All consecutive patients who underwent repair for Post- esophago-gastric hiatal hernia over the past five years were retrospectively reviewed. Patient characteristics and perioperative data were collected. The primary outcomes, repair methods, and surgical results following post-esophago-gastric hiatal repair were analyzed. A total of eight patients with post-esophago-gastric hiatal hernia were included in this study. All patients presented with emergent conditions, specifically bowel obstruction. Laparoscopic repair was successful in four cases, with a conversion rate to open surgery of 50% (4 out of 8). Primary suture was performed in three cases, while biological mesh repair was carried out in four cases, and one case was left unrepaired. Bowel gangrene and perforation occurred in one case. The most notable postoperative complications included wound infection and pleural fluid collection. Importantly, there were no instances of hernia recurrence during the follow-up period, which ranged from 2 to 55 months, with a 100% follow-up rate observed. Post-esophago-gastric hiatal hernia is a rare yet significant condition, often presenting emergently and linked to higher morbidity and mortality rates. Therefore, symptomatic patients warrant surgical repair, and immediate intervention should be provided to those with acute-onset symptoms and clinical signs of bowel obstruction. Primary suture repair, with or without biological mesh, appears to be a durable method of repair."

    "abstract": "Objectives: This systematic review aimed to evaluate current surgical and non-surgical management strategies for malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) in patients with gynaecological cancer. Methods: Comprehensive literature searches were conducted across MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and Scopus, without restrictions on language or publication date. Following the removal of duplicates, 4866 articles were screened, with 34 meeting the inclusion criteria. Results: Surgical intervention remains the definitive treatment for MBO, offering longer symptom-free periods and improved survival, particularly when conservative methods fail. However, the selection of surgical candidates is crucial due to the high risk of morbidity and the potential for significant complications. Non-surgical treatments, such as the use of Gastrografin, Octreotide, and Dexamethasone, along with invasive procedures like nasogastric tubing, percutaneous gastrostomy, and stent placement, offer varying degrees of symptom relief and are often considered when surgery is not feasible. Conclusions: In this article we provide a potential therapeutic algorithm for the management of patients with MBO. This review underscores the urgent need for high-quality research to develop clear, evidence-based guidelines for MBO management in patients with gynaecologic cancer. Establishing standardised protocols will improve patient outcomes by aiding clinicians in making informed, individualised treatment decisions."

    "abstract": "A perforated peptic ulcer (PPU) is a surgical emergency with a high mortality rate. PPUs cause secondary peritonitis due to bacterial and fungal peritoneal contamination. Surgery is the main treatment modality and patient's comorbidites impacts perioperative morbidity and surgical outcomes. Even after surgery, resuscitation efforts should continue. While empiric antibiotics are recommended, the role of empiric anti-fungal treatment is unclear due to a lack of scientific evidence. This literature review demonstrated a paucity of studies evaluating the role of empiric anti-fungals in PPUs, and with conflicting results. Studies were heterogeneous in terms of patient demographics and underlying surgical pathology (PPUs vs. any gastrointestinal perforation), type of anti-fungal agent, timing of administration and duration of use. Other considerations include the need to differentiate between fungal colonization vs. invasive fungal infection. Despite positive fungal isolates from fluid culture, it is important for clinical judgement to identify the right group of patients for anti-fungal administration. Biochemistry investigations including new fungal biomarkers may help to guide management. Multidisciplinary discussions may help in decision making for this conundrum. Moving forward, further research may be conducted to select the right group of patients who may benefit from empiric anti-fungal use."

    "abstract": "The management of gastrointestinal complications in patients with complex medical history poses significant challenges to healthcare clinicians. A 42-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency department with excruciating abdominal pain and signs of bowel obstruction. The patient had a previous history of schizophrenia and esophageal stricture, treated 6 years ago with colonic esophageal interposition. From the computed tomography scan, intussusception of the jejunum in the colonic graft was revealed, which resolved spontaneously after a few hours probably due to the oral contrast. Although, colonic esophageal interposition is a life-saving procedure for long-esophageal strictures, there are rare complications that are still not clearly reported. Jejunocolic intussusception should raise awareness of the clinicians, as one of the potential complications of colonic esophageal interposition."

Most of these patients don't have any obvious clinical symptoms. Only a few cases have been documented in the English literature. We present the unique case of a 43-year-old male without any prior surgical history who presented with nonspecific abdominal pain and was diagnosed with malrotation of the small intestine by computed tomography (CT) scan and underwent exploratory laparotomy found to have internal herniation through the transverse-mesocolon. The patient underwent an emergency laparotomy; a Ladd's procedure and repair of the hernial orifice were performed. This case highlights the association of adult intestinal malrotation with internal hernias and small bowel obstruction; it also explores the importance of timely diagnosis and adequate management of this condition."

Though rare, these devices can incur complications such as uterine perforation. Signs and symptoms are often vague abdominal and pelvic pain, and patients rarely present with a surgical emergency. This uterine perforation can happen immediately upon IUD placement or in a delayed manner. This case details an example of an IUD uterine perforation with abdominal migration two years after placement. The patient's history is complicated by the unique fact that she became pregnant and carried her pregnancy to a term vaginal delivery after the IUD had been placed. Her pregnancy led healthcare providers from previous encounters to believe that the IUD had been spontaneously expelled. The IUD was identified in the patient's left lower abdominal cavity via computed tomography (CT) and was surgically removed uneventfully."

    "abstract": "In pediatrics, appendicitis is the leading cause of emergency surgery. It was previously believed that postponing the surgery could lead to the appendix rupture. Children with this condition can be difficult to diagnose. The evidence regarding the necessity of an immediate appendectomy is a topic of debate. In this study, we evaluated the medical records of patients who were diagnosed with acute appendicitis to determine whether postponing appendectomy for one night is safe or not. This study involved 534 individuals diagnosed with acute appendicitis, who were separated into two groups: those who underwent an appendectomy immediately (within 8 hours) and those who had a delayed procedure (between 8-18 hours). We recorded and compared demographic data, symptoms, laboratory results, time of symptoms, hospitalization duration, surgery duration, overall time, length of stay after surgery, and any other complications that occurred between the two groups. The rate of surgical site infection (SSI) did not differ significantly between the groups (2.8% vs 4.2%, P=0.74). Additionally, there was no significant difference in the risk of perforation between the time of surgery in our study (21.9% vs 19.8%, P>0.05). Our findings suggest that there is no increased risk of complications such as perforation when appendectomy is delayed for up to 18 hours."

    "abstract": "Femoral hernias have a high incarceration rate, often necessitating urgent surgical intervention. In this report, we present a safe and reproducible laparoscopic technique for incarcerated femoral hernias with bowel involvement, including repair. Between December 2022 and May 2023, three female patients with incarcerated femoral hernias underwent urgent laparoscopic surgery. All patients presented with abdominal pain and were diagnosed with small bowel incarceration using computed tomography. Under laparoscopy, we confirmed intestinal incarceration and performed a standard transabdominal preperitoneal approach to identify the hernia defects. The iliopubic tract on the abdominal side of the hernia defect was carefully dissected using an energy device to enlarge the hernia orifice. A spontaneous reduction of the incarcerated intestine was achieved. After confirming the absence of bowel perforation, mesh was placed to repair the hernia. Following peritoneal closure, the affected part of the intestine was extracorporeally resected and anastomosed. We performed this technique on three patients, all of whom were later discharged without complications. In conclusion, for incarcerated femoral hernias with bowel obstruction, laparoscopic partial division of the iliopubic tract enables an easy, safe, and reproducible approach to incarceration release and subsequent hernia repair."

    "abstract": "Appendectomy is the preferred treatment for acute uncomplicated appendicitis and the most common emergency abdominal surgery. While previous studies have investigated variables affecting post-appendectomy complications, local research is limited, and data on complication rates are scarce. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate appendectomy outcomes and the factors influencing them. This retrospective record review included all patients who underwent appendectomies at our center between 2013 and 2023, excluding those who underwent appendectomies as part of other procedures. Data were retrieved from the hospital database and recorded on predesigned Google Forms. A total of 556 patients were included. Complications occurred in 60 patients (10.8%); the most common included intra-abdominal collections (n=19, 3.4%), postoperative fever (n=13, 2.3%), and surgical site infections (n=11, 2.0%). The most frequently documented histopathological diagnoses included acute appendicitis (n=402, 72.3%), perforated appendicitis (n=109, 19.6%), and gangrenous appendicitis (n=19, 4.4%). Surgical site infection rates were higher after open appendectomies (6.0% vs. 0.9%, P=0.006), while intra-abdominal collections were more frequent after laparoscopic appendectomies (4.1% vs. 0.0%, P=0.095). Additionally, histopathology results showing complicated or chronic appendicitis were associated with higher complication rates (P<0.001, odds ratio=3.793, 95% confidence interval=1.957-7.350). To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest retrospective review of appendectomy cases in Saudi Arabia. However, this study was conducted in a tertiary care center, which may have caused the rates of complications to appear lower than those in primary centers. We recommend a multi-center study be conducted to establish more accurate results."

    "abstract": "Uterine perforation and bowel injury are rare but potentially life-threatening complications of surgical abortion. Early diagnosis results in easier management and better prognosis. We report here a case of a 39-year-old presented with peritonitis secondary to traumatic bowel perforation after second-trimester surgical abortion. A 39-year-old Gravida 3 Para 2 presented with acute abdominal pain two days after second trimester induced abortion. On physical examination, the patient was febrile and hypotensive with diffuse abdominal tenderness. Emergency abdomino-pelvic-CT showed generalized peritonitis with pneumoperitoneum. The patient underwent an emergency laparotomy. Per operative exploration revealed a perforation of the fundus of the uterus and the sigmoid portion of the large intestine, resulting in stercoral peritonitis. We proceeded with thorough cleansing of the abdominal cavity with physiological serum, followed by partial colectomy including the perforated sigmoid and a Hartmann's procedure. The patient was admitted to the post-operative intensive care unit for 18 days and discharged on day 27 after the surgery. Intestinal continuity restoration was performed six months after the surgery. Given the severity of second trimester pregnancy termination complications, efforts should be made to promote contraception and medical first-trimester pregnancy termination. Any unusual symptom after surgical induced abortion should lead to suspect uterine perforation. Uterine perforation during induced abortion is usually asymptomatic and can generally be managed conservatively. However, bowel injury may result in peritonitis, requiring immediate laparotomy and resection of perforated bowel. CT-scans can help diagnose this rare complication."

Overall, internal hernias are between 0.2 % and 0.9 %, while 53 % of these statistics are for PDH. There are left and right types of PDHs. An otherwise healthy 26-year-old man was presented with a sudden-onset epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Abdominopelvic double contrasted CT scan revealed multiple dilated proximal-mid small bowel loops in the portal venous phase consistent with small bowel obstruction, suggesting concomitant bowel malrotation with internal paraduodenal hernia. The patient with the pre-operative diagnosis of small bowel obstruction due to volvulus was scheduled for emergency surgery. He was four weeks complication-free in his regular follow-up. In 1857, Treitz first described PDH as a phenomenon when the primitive midgut in embryonic life abnormally rotates and causes mesocolic hernia. The location of the duodenal recess is the origin point for describing the hernia; thus, the jejunum is the most common herniating viscus. However, the stomach, small intestine, and sometimes the colon usually consist of the contents of the hernia. In the absence of surgical history, abdominal wall hernia, and intra-abdominal inflammatory disease, in case of repeated abdominal pain or intestinal obstruction, and if no other causes are found, the possibility of a PDH should be kept in mind."

    "abstract": "A bowel diameter threshold of ≥2.5 cm, originally derived from the research using computed tomography, is frequently used for diagnosing small bowel obstruction (SBO) with point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). We sought to determine the optimal bowel diameter threshold for diagnosing SBO using POCUS and its accuracy in predicting surgical intervention. We conducted a secondary analysis using individual patient-level data from a previous systematic review on POCUS for SBO diagnosis across five academic EDs. Patient data were collected, including imaging results, surgical findings, and final diagnosis. The measured diameter of the small bowel using POCUS was recorded. ROC area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) were constructed to determine the optimal threshold for bowel diameter in predicting SBO diagnosis and surgical intervention. Subgroup analyses were performed based on sex and age. A total of 403 patients had individual patient-level data available, with 367 patients included in the final analysis. The most accurate bowel diameter overall for predicting SBO was 2.75 cm (AUC = 0.76, 95% CI 0.71-0.81). A bowel diameter of ≤1.7 cm had 100% sensitivity with no miss rate, while a bowel diameter of ≥4 cm had 90.7% specificity in confirming SBO. Patients under 65 had an optimal threshold of 2.75 cm versus 2.95 cm in patients over 65. Females had an optimal threshold of 2.75 cm, while males had a value of 2.95 cm. There was no significant correlation between bowel diameter thresholds and surgical intervention. A bowel diameter threshold of 2.75 cm on POCUS is more discriminative diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing SBO. Patients' age and sex may impact diagnostic accuracy, suggesting that tailored approaches may be needed."

Computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed a grossly distended stomach (113 × 187 × 350mm) and a transition point at the third part of the duodenum, along with pneumatosis and portal venous gas. Emergency gastroscopy showed blood and necrotic mucosa. Laparotomy confirmed full thickness necrosis and the patient underwent a total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction. Postoperatively, he had a brief intensive care stay and recovered without complications. This case underscores the importance of considering SMA syndrome during presentations of acute gastric dilatation."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is a common surgical emergency that poses a large clinical and economic burden. Understanding the global burden of appendicitis is crucial for evaluating unmet needs and implementing and scaling up intervention services to reduce adverse health outcomes. This study aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the global, regional, and national burden of appendicitis, by age and sex, from 1990 to 2021. Vital registration and verbal autopsy data, the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm), and demographic estimates from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) were used to estimate cause-specific mortality rates (CSMRs) for appendicitis. Incidence data were extracted from insurance claims and inpatient discharge sources and analysed with disease modelling meta-regression, version 2.1 (DisMod-MR 2.1). Years of life lost (YLLs) were estimated by combining death counts with standard life expectancy at the age of death. Years lived with disability (YLDs) were estimated by multiplying incidence estimates by an average disease duration of 2 weeks and a disability weight for abdominal pain. YLLs and YLDs were summed to estimate disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). In 2021, the global age-standardised mortality rate of appendicitis was 0·358 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 0·311-0·414) per 100 000. Mortality rates ranged from 1·01 (0·895-1·13) per 100 000 in central Latin America to 0·054 (0·0464-0·0617) per 100 000 in high-income Asia Pacific. The global age-standardised incidence rate of appendicitis in 2021 was 214 (174-274) per 100 000, corresponding to 17 million (13·8-21·6) new cases. The incidence rate was the highest in high-income Asia Pacific, at 364 (286-475) per 100 000 and the lowest in western sub-Saharan Africa, at 81·4 (63·9-109) per 100 000. The global age-standardised rates of mortality, incidence, YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs due to appendicitis decreased steadily between 1990 and 2021, with the largest reduction in mortality and YLL rates. The global annualised rate of decline in the DALY rate was greatest in children younger than the age of 10 years. Although mortality rates due to appendicitis decreased in all regions, there were large regional variations in the temporal trend in incidence. Although the global age-standardised incidence rate of appendicitis has steadily decreased between 1990 and 2021, almost half of GBD regions saw an increase of greater than 10% in their age-standardised incidence rates. Slow but promising progress has been observed in reducing the overall burden of appendicitis in all regions. However, there are important geographical variations in appendicitis incidence and mortality, and the relationship between these measures suggests that many people still do not have access to quality health care. As the incidence of appendicitis is rising in many parts of the world, countries should prepare their health-care infrastructure for timely, high-quality diagnosis and treatment. Given the risk that improved diagnosis may counterintuitively drive apparent rising trends in incidence, these efforts should be coupled with improved data collection, which will also be crucial for understanding trends and developing targeted interventions.

    "abstract": "Leiomyoma torsion is an incredibly rare entity. Diagnosis is frequently intraoperative due to poor correlation between clinical symptoms and radiological findings. We report a case of a twisted uterine leimyoma diagnosed intraoperatively. Our patient was 46 years old, nulliparous woman, presented to the emergency department with three days of acute pelvic pain. On physical examination, a firm and tender pelvic mass was palpable, extending below the umbilicus, suggestive of uterine origin. Laboratory investigations revealed an inflammatory response. Ultrasound identified a large abdomino-pelvic mass adherent to the right side of the uterus, with no detectable blood flow on Doppler examination. Given the diagnostic uncertainty, exploratory laparoscopy was performed. The diagnosis of a pedunculated Leiomyoma torsion with acute appendicitis was confirmed. Initially we performed a fibroid detorsion then a myomectomy and appendectomy were performed. The torsion of the vascular pedicle of a subserous leiomyoma can lead to ischemic gangrene and peritonitis, which can cause mortality. The risk factors that contribute to the fibroid torsion include the size, the stalk of the pedunculated myoma that must be thin and long in order for it to undergo rotation and torsion. There are no specific clinical signs or imaging modalities that reliably indicate the diagnosis. A diagnostic laparoscopy is most often indicated in case of diagnostic doubt. Surgery may consist in myomectomy or hysterectomy. It is important to consider the possibility of torsed leiomyoma in the differential diagnosis in any woman presenting with an intra-abdominal and pelvic mass with acute abdomen."

    "abstract": "We conducted this study to assess the effects of the acute care surgery (ACS) model in the management of patients with acute appendicitis (AA) based on our 5-year single-center, retrospective experience. The current single-center, retrospective, observational study was conducted in a consecutive series of the patients with AA who had been surgically treated at a tertiary referral hospital in Seoul, Korea, between January 2016 and December 2020. At our institution, the ACS model was first introduced in March 2018. Therefore, our clinical series of the patients were divided into 2 groups: the pre-ACS group (March 2014 to February 2018) and the post-ACS group (March 2018 to December 2022). Key time intervals include emergency department registration to request for surgical consultation, request for surgical consultation to decision on surgery, decision-to-operating room, time to decision on surgery and length of emergency department stay. Moreover, outcomes include rates of perforation and complications and discharge within 24 or 48 hours. We compared key time intervals, outcomes, and length of hospital stay between the 2 groups. A total of 900 patients with AA were finally included in the current study, 447 and 453 of whom were divided into the pre-ACS group (n = 447) and the post-ACS group (n = 453), respectively. There were significant differences in key time intervals, outcomes, and length of hospital stay between the 2 groups (P < .05). In conclusion, our results showed that the implementation of the ACS model was effective in improving key time intervals, rates of perforation, and discharge within 24 or 48 hours in the patients with AA."

    "title": "The use of self-expanding metallic stents in the management of benign colonic obstruction: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Patients presenting with large bowel obstruction (LBO) frequently undergo emergency surgery that is associated with significant morbidity. In malignant LBO, endoscopic approaches with placement is a self-expanding metal stent (SEMS), have been proposed to prevent emergency surgery and act as a bridge to an elective procedure-with the intention of avoiding a stoma and reducing morbidity. This systematic review aims to assess the quality and outcomes of data available on the use of SEMS in benign causes of colonic obstruction. This systematic review was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and the protocol was registered on Prospero (ID: CRD42021239363). PUBMED, MEDLINE, HMIC, CINAHL, AMED, EMBASE, APA and Cochrane databases were searched. Studies were assessed for quality utilising the MINORS criteria. Pooled odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using random effects models. Sixteen studies were included for analysis. 300 patients were included with an average age of 68, and a male predominance of 57%. The quality of the papers included were at risk of bias. The pooled rate of technical success of procedure was 94.4% (95% CI 90.5-96.8%) The pooled rate of clinical success was 77.6% (95% CI: 66.6-85.7%). Adverse effects were low, with perforation 8.8% (4.5-16.6%), recurrence 26.5% (17.2-38.5%) and stent migration 22.5% (14.1-33.8%). This systematic review demonstrated that SEMS for benign colonic obstruction can be a safe and successful procedure. The utilisation of SEMS in malignant disease as a bridge to surgery has been well documented. Whilst the limitations of the data interpreted are appreciated, we postulate that SEMS could be utilised to decompress patients acutely and allow pre-operative optimisation, leading to a more elective surgery with less subsequent morbidity."

    "abstract": "The overuse of antibiotics has led to the rapid development of multi-drug resistant bacteria, making antibiotics increasingly ineffective against bacterial infections. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop alternative strategies to combat multi-drug-resistant bacterial infections. In this study, gold nanoparticles modified with ellagic acid (EA-AuNPs) were prepared using a simple and mild one-pot hydrothermal process. EA-AuNPs demonstrated high bactericidal efficacy and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities against clinical isolates of the antibiotic-resistant ESKAPE pathogens. Furthermore, EA-AuNPs effectively disperse biofilms of multi-drug-resistant bacteria. Additionally, EA-AuNPs mitigated inflammatory responses at the bacterial infection sites. The combined bactericidal and anti-inflammatory treatment with EA-AuNPs resulted in faster curing of peritonitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus in mice compared to treatment with free EA or gentamicin. Moreover, transcriptome analysis revealed that EA-AuNPs exhibited a multi-targeting mechanism, making resistance development in pathogens more challenging than traditional antibiotics that recognize specific cellular targets. Overall, EA-AuNPs emerged as a promising antimicrobial agent against multi-drug-resistant bacterial infections."

    "abstract": "Malignant transformation of ovarian teratomas is rare, provoking peritonitis and death are exceedingly rare. We present the case of a 75-year-old woman who was admitted to the emergency department for severe abdominal pain with septic shock due to acute peritonitis caused by perforation of the ovarian mass. Teratomas are germ cell tumors usually composed of multiple cell types derived from one or more of the three germ layers. Pathologically, malignant transformation of ovarian dermoid cysts is rare due to the thickness of the capsule, spontaneous rupture is a very rare complication, acute peritonitis presents with features of acute abdomen or shock, treatment is essentially surgical and includes at least unilateral adnexectomy, complete exploration of the pelvis and abdominal cavity, peritoneal washing and/or sampling of any ascites. In conclusion, although ovarian teratoma with granulomatous peritonitis is rare, rupture leading to generalised acute peritonitis further worsens the prognosis. Which will ensure correct management that will provide a good outcome with less complications."

Bowel obstruction (BO) is usually a complication of advanced cancer, significantly reducing the quality of life. We aimed to study the outcomes of these obstructed colorectal cancers requiring emergency intervention and compare it with nonobstructed cancers. In our observational comparative study, patients were divided into groups on basis of their presentation and site of lesion: nonobstructing colon group/obstructing colon group nonobstructing rectum group/obstructing rectum group. A total of 232 patients with known modes of presentation between 2015 and 2018 were included; 144 colonic, 88 rectal carcinomas with 71 being completely obstructive ones. Our study showed higher recurrence in obstructive groups with local recurrence being more common. The median interval for recurrence was early in obstructive group (p < 0.001*). The overall 5-year survival rates were better in Nonobstructing colon group, (p = -0.046* in OR vs NOR) (p = -0.031* in OC vs NOC). 5-year disease-free survival rates statistically insignificant (p = 0.203 in NOC and OC groups), (p = 0.307 in NOR and OR groups). Immediate post-op, complications except for SSI, there was no significant difference between the two groups. Our study showed higher proportion of R0 resection in NOC groups as compared with obstructive groups (p = 0.021* in in OC vs NOC and p = 0.037* in OR vs NOR) with better lymph node retrieval in NOC groups. On comparing outcome of patients who had completed multi-modal therapy in both groups, there was significantly better outcome for patients who have presented without obstruction.

Postcholecystectomy duodenal injuries are rare but challenging complications after cholecystectomy. The objective of this study was to analyze the management of postcholecystectomy duodenal injuries and to review the related literature. An observational and retrospective study was conducted. We included all patients with postcholecystectomy duodenal injuries treated at a reference center, from January 2019 to December 2023. In addition, a review of the literature was carried out. Fifteen patients were found, mostly women; with gallbladder wall thickening on ultrasound (mean of 8 mm). The majority were emergency (n = 12, 80%) and LCs (n = 8, 53.33%). Cholecystectomies were reported to be associated with excessive difficulty (n = 10, 66.66%). The most injured duodenal portion was the first portion (n = 9, 60%), and blunt dissection was the most common mechanism of injury (n = 7, 46.66%). Most of these injuries were detected in the operating room (n = 9, 60%), and treated with primary closure (n = 11, 73.33%). Three patients with delayed injuries died (20%). According to the literature reviewed, 93 duodenal injuries were found, mostly detected intraoperatively, in the second portion, and treated with primary closure. A minority of patients were treated with more complex procedures, for a mortality rate of 15.38%. Postcholecystectomy duodenal injuries are rare. Most of these injuries are detected and repaired intraoperatively. However, a high percentage of patients have high morbidity and mortality. Diaz-Martinez J, Pérez-Correa N.

    "abstract": "An acute abdomen is a medical emergency that requires early diagnosis and treatment. In pregnancy, this process is significantly more challenging, and radiological findings are sometimes unclear due to the enlarged uterus displacing other structures. Moreover, endometriosis-related complications are rare, and the disease is often undiagnosed. We report a case of acute perforation of the cecum and appendix during pregnancy (35 weeks of gestation) caused by a previously unknown, deep infiltrating endometriosis with focal ulceration of the affected bowel wall, which sonographically seemed to be acute appendicitis. Despite the relatively low risk, clinicians should be aware of possible endometriosis-associated complications in pregnancy with potentially life-threatening events, even in previously unknown endometriosis. Further studies should evaluate intestinal complications during pregnancy in relation to previous treatment of intestinal endometriosis (conservative vs. surgical)."

    "abstract": "The objective was to investigate the feasibility of prospectively validating multiple clinical prediction scores (CPSs) for pediatric appendicitis in an Australian pediatric emergency department (ED). A literature search was conducted to identify potential CPSs and a single-center prospective observational feasibility study was performed between November 2022 and May 2023 to evaluate the performance of identified CPSs. Children 5-15 years presenting with acute right-sided or generalized abdominal pain and clinician suspicion of appendicitis were included. CPSs were calculated by the study team from prospectively clinician-collected data and/or review of medical records. Accuracy of CPSs were assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and proportions correctly identifiable as either low-risk or high-risk with the best performing CPS compared to clinician gestalt. Final diagnosis of appendicitis was confirmed on histopathology or by telephone/email follow-up for those discharged directly from ED. Thirty CPSs were identified in the literature search and 481 patients were enrolled in the study. A total of 150 (31.2%) patients underwent appendectomy with three (2.0%) having a normal appendix on histopathology. All identified CPSs were calculable for at least 50% of the patient cohort. The pediatric Appendicitis Risk Calculator for pediatric EDs (pARC-ED; n = 317) was the best performing CPS with AUC 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86-0.94) and specificity 99.0% (95% CI 96.4%-99.7%) in diagnosing high-risk cases and a misclassification rate of 4.5% for low-risk cases. The study identified 30 CPSs that could be validated in a majority of patients to compare their ability to assess risk of pediatric appendicitis. The pARC-ED had the highest predictive accuracy and can potentially assist in risk stratification of children with suspected appendicitis in pediatric EDs. A multicenter study is now under way to evaluate the potential of these CPSs in a broader range of EDs to aid clinical decision making in more varied settings."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common cause of acute abdomen worldwide. The complications associated with it can sometimes be unpredictable and pose a dilemma in the management of such complications. A case of 18 year female with complaints of right iliac fossa pain and vomiting was diagnosed clinically as acute appendicitis and underwent emergency open appendectomy where a cecal perforation was encountered intra-operatively for which a Modified Graham's Patch Repair was done. Acute appendicitis can sometimes present with complications like perforation, among which cecal perforation is rare and difficult to diagnose in the initial setting. Perforated appendicitis or colon can increase morbidity and mortality significantly. High degree of suspicion and early surgical approach can lead to identification of rare complications, which can still pose a surgical dilemma on the approach of management. Cecal perforation in suspected acute appendicitis is a rarely encountered intra operative complication. Management approaches can range from less invasive suture with omental patch repair to more invasive right hemicolectomy."

    "abstract": "Colon cancer has seen a steady decline in incidence due to increased colonoscopy use. We can assume that this increased use, results in a higher incidence of post-colonoscopy complications such postpolypectomy syndrome, perforation and post-colonoscopy appendicitis (PCA). In this report, we present a case of PCA presenting to the emergency department within 12 h of a screening colonoscopy. Our patient, a 77-year-old male, underwent an uncomplicated screening colonoscopy and was discharged home after briefly being monitored without any complaints. Later that day, the patient presented to the emergency department complaining of acute generalized abdominal pain. On presentation, the patient was found to be hypertensive and febrile with a distended abdomen with right lower quadrant tenderness on examination. Laboratory investigations noted an elevated white blood cell count with no evidence of acute appendicitis or focal inflammatory changes on contrast-enhanced abdominal and pelvic computer tomography. The patient was subsequently admitted and developed worsening right lower quadrant abdominal pain and distention overnight. Due to this worsening clinical condition, the decision was made to proceed with a diagnostic laparoscopy. After frank pus was found laparoscopically around the cecum and appendix, it was then converted to an exploratory laparotomy. Subsequently, a perforated gangrenous appendix was found with an erythematous and indurated cecum. Major complications of colonoscopy can include perforation and/or post-colonoscopy bleeding which have been shown to have a respective incidence of 0.21% and 0.1%. With the anticipated rise in the number of colonoscopies, much rarer complications such as PCA with an incidence of less than 0.05% will be seen more frequently. Due to its nonspecific presentation, it is necessary for providers to consider PCA as an important differential for all patients presenting with abdominal pain after a colonoscopy."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a typical surgical emergency worldwide and one of the common causes of surgical acute abdomen in the elderly. Accurately diagnosing and differentiating acute appendicitis can assist clinicians in formulating a scientific and reasonable treatment plan and providing high-quality medical services for the elderly. In this study, we validated and analyzed the different performances of various machine learning models based on the analysis of clinical data, so as to construct a simple, fast, and accurate estimation method for the diagnosis of early acute appendicitis. The dataset of this paper was obtained from the medical data of elderly patients with acute appendicitis attending the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui University of Chinese Medicine from January 2012 to January 2022, including 196 males (60.87%) and 126 females (39.13%), including 103 (31.99%) patients with complicated appendicitis and 219 (68.01%) patients with uncomplicated appendicitis. By comparing and analyzing the prediction results of the models implemented by nine different machine learning techniques (LR, CART, RF, SVM, Bayes, KNN, NN, FDA, and GBM), we found that the GBM algorithm gave the optimal results and that sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, precision, recall, F1 and brier are 0.9167, 0.9739, 0.9429, 0.9613, 0.9429, 0.9167, 0.9296, and 0.05649, respectively. The GBM model prediction results are interpreted using the SHAP technology framework. Calibration and Decision curve analysis also show that the machine learning model proposed in this paper has some clinical and economic benefits. Finally, we developed the Shiny application for complicated appendicitis diagnosis to assist clinicians in quickly and effectively recognizing patients with complicated appendicitis (CA) and uncomplicated appendicitis (UA), and to formulate a more reasonable and scientific clinical plan for acute appendicitis patient population promptly."

Patients suffering from perforation were compared with patients without perforation during PCI. PCI was performed in a weighted total of 10,059,269 patients. Coronary perforation occurred in 11,725 (0.12%) of all PCI performed. The mortality rate of patients with perforations was very high in comparison to patients without perforations. (12.9% vs. 2.5%, odds ratio, 5.6; CI, 5-6.3; P < 0.001). Furthermore, patients with coronary perforations had much higher rates of urgent coronary bypass surgery, tamponade, cardiac arrest, and major cardiovascular outcomes. Mortality remained high and over 10% in the 5-year study period. Using a large national inpatient database, all-cause inpatient mortality in patients with coronary perforation is very high (over 10%), with persistently high mortality rates over the years, suggesting that treatment of perforations needs further improvement."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a major cause of emergency surgery in children and adolescents. Mesenteric lymphadenitis is also one of the most common differential diagnoses in children with acute appendicitis, and despite its high prevalence, few clinical studies have examined its features. The clinical signs of mesenteric lymphadenitis in children are very similar to those of acute appendicitis. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical manifestations of acute appendicitis and mesenteric lymphadenitis in children. In this cross-sectional study, patients less than 15 years old admitted to the pediatric emergency center of Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman from 2018 to 2021 were studied, and those who had a final diagnosis of appendicitis, mesenteric lymphadenitis, or appendectomy were included in the study by census. Data collection from the records of these patients included age, sex, clinical signs, duration of emergency until diagnosis, fever, number of times of vomiting, leukocytosis, lymphocyte, neutrophil count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, sonographic findings, and pathology findings. SPSS software and descriptive and analytical statistics were used to analyze the data. The results showed that unlike sex (p=0.11), there was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of age (p<0.001). Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, pain shift, and leukocytosis were more common in the acute appendicitis group than in the mesenteric lymphadenitis group, with a significant difference between the two groups (p<0.001). There was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of neutrophil percentage and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (p<0.001). The present study was conducted with the aim of assisting medical professionals due to the possibility of misdiagnosing mesenteric lymphadenitis with acute appendicitis. Differentiation of these two diseases is facilitated by the significant differences in their clinical signs and test results. These results can be a useful guide for physicians to better diagnose the diseases."

    "abstract": "Lipoblastomas are benign neoplasms that arise from embryonal adipocytes. They predominantly impact the pediatric population, with most cases occurring in the first few years of life. These tumors typically present as a soft, palpable, painless mass and tend to involve the mesenchymal tissues of the extremities and trunk. Intraabdominal involvement and intraabdominal complications secondary to lipoblastoma are incredibly rare. Here, we present the case of a nine-year-old female who presented to the emergency department (ED) with one week of intermittent lower abdominal pain. The CT abdomen/pelvis demonstrated a well-circumscribed hypodense omental mass measuring 10.1 cm x 4.7 cm x 13.4 cm with minimal mass effect or bowel displacement. At that time, the patient's abdomen was soft without tenderness, distention, or rigidity. Her initial laboratory studies and vital signs were within normal limits. She was evaluated by pediatric surgery, who, given her clinical stability, planned for an anticipated elective resection. Thirteen days after her initial ED visit, the patient returned to the ED with nausea, vomiting, and diffuse abdominal pain. Repeat CT abdomen/pelvis revealed shifting of the omental mass from the left hemi-abdomen to the right hemi-abdomen with associated mesenteric 'swirl sign' and dilated loops of small bowel consistent with small bowel obstruction. Given the patient's CT findings and signs of peritonitis on a physical exam, she was emergently taken to the operating room, where the mass along with 20 cm of small bowel intimately associated with the mass was resected. The proximal end of the involved bowel was found to be twisted and necrotic, consistent with volvulus. A specimen was sent for cytogenetics and found to be positive for FLAG1, ultimately revealing a diagnosis of lipoblastoma. The majority of lipoblastoma development is underpinned by gene rearrangements in the zinc-finger transcription factor PLAG1. Although benign, these tumors can exhibit rapid proliferation and have high recurrence rates. Patients should be monitored long-term with ultrasound (US) or MRI following surgery to assess for recurrence."

This pathology is rarely a medical emergency unless a complication is encountered. Such complications include infection, necrosis, perforation, incarceration, and uncontrolled pain. Case Presentation: We report a case of an elderly patient with pain associated with chronic rectal prolapse. Surgical intervention had been ruled out, and there had been no pain relief after using systemic analgesics. Case Management: Based on increasing reports of analgesic properties, topical methylene blue (MB) 0.1% was applied externally at the prolapsed organ, obtaining pain relief. Case Outcome: The patient experienced immediate and long-lasting pain relief; MB applications were continued every 12 hours as needed. After this therapy, the patient was no longer in need of systemic analgesics. No side effects were reported. Conclusion: Topical MB may be an effective analgesic for the management of pain associated with chronic rectal prolapse. This treatment might be extrapolated to other clinical scenarios of tegumentary pain. Similar use has been shown to be safe and effective in other pathologies, including pain in oral mucositis associated with cancer therapy."

He improved clinically over the next several days and was started on a diet that was initially well tolerated. Shortly after transitioning to a regular diet, he developed severe abdominal pain. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed pneumoperitoneum and he was taken emergently to the operating room (OR) for exploratory laparotomy (ex-lap). A perforation was found in the terminal ileum and he underwent a right hemicolectomy. He returned to the OR two days later for ileocolic anastomosis and fascial closure.

    "abstract": "Intestinal malrotation is primarily diagnosed in the neonatal period, when symptoms typically first appear. In contrast, occurrences in adults are quite uncommon. Adult cases are less frequently reported, often because the condition remains asymptomatic or presents with nonspecific symptoms that can delay diagnosis. Intestinal malrotation in adults can show a range of symptoms, from acute bowel obstruction to vague and chronic symptoms, often leading to a delay in the diagnosis compared to children. Patients with this condition present a distinctive challenge for surgeons regarding diagnosis and treatment, especially in acute situations. This study presents a rare case of a 16-year-old boy who came with chief complaints of acute abdominal pain and multiple episodes of bilious vomiting. The patient underwent an emergency laparoscopy converted to an open Ladd's procedure. During surgery, the duodenum, small intestine, cecum, and appendix were discovered to be abnormally positioned, and the transverse colon and mesentery were twisted along with the superior mesenteric artery and superior mesenteric vein, with the presence of classical Ladd's bands confirming preoperative CT findings of midgut volvulus. The patient tolerated the procedure well, with no intraoperative complications. Acute midgut volvulus is rare in adults and older children. Still, the differential diagnosis should be kept in mind in patients with pain in the abdomen and multiple episodes of bilious vomiting in cases with an uncertain diagnosis to plan proper management and avoid intraoperative surprises. Early detection, accurate imaging methods, and prompt intervention can mitigate complications that could increase morbidity and mortality."

Peer review by RAs was performed on 30% (n = 247118) of the total volume 828526 studies reported, and yielded additional findings including but not limited to fractures (218; 23%), hemorrhage,(94; 10%) pulmonary thromboembolism, (n = 104; 11%), Calculus (n = 75; 8%) lesion (n = 66; 5%), appendicitis(n = 50; 4%) and others. These were brought to the attention of the radiologist, who agreed in 97% (1279 out of 1318) of cases, and communicated the same to the referring facility, with an addended report. Trained RAs can provide value to the peer review program of a busy teleradiology practice and decrease errors. This may be useful to meet the ongoing radiologist shortages."

    "title": "The role of computed tomography in acute bowel obstruction due to a supravesical hernia: a case report from Nepal.",
    "abstract": "Supravesical hernias are rare internal hernias but potential cause of small-bowel obstruction. The clinical features are often non-specific, preoperative diagnosis is very difficult and is often diagnosed intraoperatively. The exact pathogenesis is unclear with the major risk factors of prematurity, a positive family history, male sex, smoking habits leading to decreased collagen production, advancing age, and conditions characterized by defective collagen synthesis. The authors are reporting a case of small-bowel obstruction secondary to a supravesical hernia, in a 78-year-old male presented with central abdominal pain, vomiting and obstipation. Ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis identified a marked dilation of the small-bowel loop with multiple loops of dilated jejunum and ileum in contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with lead point from the terminal ileum. Exploratory laparotomy was done with the diagnosis of left posterior a left posterior superior vesical hernia with small-bowel obstruction. The case focuses supravesical hernia as a rare yet life-threatening etiology of small-bowel obstruction, emphasizing the importance of clinical suspicion when patients present with signs and symptoms of bowel obstruction. While diagnosis often occurs intraoperatively, the utilization of CT scans in emergency settings can provide valuable insights into the location, potential causes, and condition of the herniated bowel sac. The case highlights the pivotal role of CT scans in diagnosis and emphasizes the need for multidisciplinary cooperation among clinicians, radiologists, and surgeons. Early intervention ensures better outcomes and prevents irreversible bowel damage, underscoring the importance of a comprehensive approach to patient care."

    "abstract": "Gastro-duodenal perforation is a common surgical emergency that remains a formidable health burden worldwide with significant morbidity and mortality. Ulcer disease remains the most common cause of gastro-duodenal perforation. Diagnosing the presence of H. pylori can help eradicate the infection from the community at large and thereby reduce the chances of gastro-duodenal perforation. To assess the clinical presentation of gastro-duodenal perforation patients and to evaluate the detection of Helicobacter pylori infection by available investigations. A descriptive observational study was conducted among 80 patients presenting with clinical features suggestive of gastro-duodenal perforation and confirmed by clinical, radiological basis and operative findings admitted at a rural tertiary care hospital during 2019-2020. Detailed history was taken from the patient/party, clinically examined, and blood/tissue samples were investigated. The patients were managed with standard treatment modality in the studied institute. Data were collected, compiled, and entered MS Excel and analyzed using appropriate software. Descriptive analysis was done in the form of proportion for categorical variables, mean or median for continuous variables. Cases of gastro-duodenal perforations were more among middle to later age of life, mostly affecting married male patients hailed from rural area and unskilled workers. History of intake of spicy food, prolonged starvation, history of NSAID use were common among them. Majority of the patients had history of pain abdomen in the past suggesting of PUD and history of taking variety group of acid reducing agents. Most of them presented with epigastric pain, vomiting, abdominal distension along with other signs of peritonitis. Obliteration of liver dullness and free gas under right dome of diaphragm was also noted in large proportion among them. Majority of cases were found positive for H. pylori on Histology (85%), followed by rapid urease test (RUT) (80%) and a positivity of 72.5% and 68.8% on serum IgG and IgA antibody respectively. Rapid Urease Test was more sensitive as well as specific in diagnosing of H. pylori than antibody detection test. Early detection of H. pylori infection and treatment with potent anti H. pylori therapy postoperatively has been found to be adequate."

    "abstract": "Gallbladder perforations are challenging to manage for surgeons due to their high morbidity and mortality, rarity, and surgical approach. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is now included with open cholecystectomy in surgical managing gallbladder perforations. This study aimed to evaluate the factors affecting conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy in cases of type I gallbladder perforation according to the Modified Niemeier classification. Patients who met the inclusion criteria were divided into two groups: LC and conversion to open cholecystectomy (COC). Demographic, clinical, radiologic, intraoperative, and postoperative factors were compared between groups. This study included 42 patients who met the inclusion criteria, of which 28 were in the LC group and 14 were in the COC group. Their median age was 68 (55-85) years. Age did not differ significantly between groups (p = 0.218). However, the sex distribution did differ significantly between groups (p = 0.025). The location of the perforation differed significantly between groups (p < 0.001). In the LC group, 22 patients were perforated from the fundus, four from the trunk, and two from the neck. In the COC group, two patients were perforated from the fundus, four from the trunk, and eight from the neck. Surgical procedure times differed significantly between the LC (105.0 min [60-225]) and COC (125.0 min [110-180]) groups (p = 0.035). The age of the primary surgeons also differed significantly between the LC (42 years [34-63]) and COC (55 years [36-59]) groups (p = 0.001). LC can be safely performed for modified Niemeier type I gallbladder perforations. The proximity of the perforation site to Calot's triangle, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), and Tokyo classification are factors affecting conversion from laparoscopic to open surgery of gallbladder perforations."

    "abstract": "A 74-year-old male patient was referred with signs of sepsis 5 days after having been diagnosed with a rib fracture following a fall out of bed. Novel hypodensities were visible on thoracic X‑rays and laboratory tests revealed elevated inflammatory parameters. Subsequently performed thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan showed burst fracture of the 3rd thoracic vertebra, posttraumatic esophageal rupture at the same level and mediastinitis. Furthermore, marked degenerative changes of the spinal column (diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis) were present. The patient underwent emergency thoracotomy and esophagectomy. Gastric pull-up with esophagogastrostomy was postponed for 3 days. After 14 days on the intensive care unit (ICU) and 12 days of i.v. antibiotics, the patient was transferred to the general ward and 7 weeks after trauma the patient was infection-free without difficulties in swallowing. Up to the latest follow-up 41 months following injury, several endoscopic dilations with a bougie due to constrictions at the anastomosis have been performed. Similar to previous cases in the literature, esophageal injury was diagnosed delayed, with the patient already having developed severe complications. This extremely seldom injury should be suspected in young patients following high-energy trauma, but also in older patients after low-energy trauma but known degenerative changes of the vertebral column."

    "abstract": "Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in the emergency department (ED) may facilitate the diagnosis of nonsurgical sources of abdominal pain after surgical causes are excluded. Identifying mesenteric adenitis is a feasible POCUS application due to its ease of use and speed. However, there are scant data regarding the diagnosis of mesenteric adenitis by POCUS. The objective of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics, outcomes, and interobserver agreement of mesenteric adenitis identified on POCUS in pediatric patients with nonsurgical abdominal pain. This was a retrospective review at a tertiary-care, urban pediatric ED. All cases of mesenteric adenitis diagnosed on POCUS from January 2018 to August 2022 were reviewed. Demographics and clinical data, including relevant outcomes, were recorded. All POCUS videos were reviewed by a senior sonologist-physician for determination of mesenteric adenitis in children 21 years and younger with nonsurgical abdominal pain. Interobserver agreement by Cohen κ was calculated between experienced and novice physician sonologists blinded to diagnosis, who reviewed 77 six-second video clips for presence or absence of mesenteric adenitis. Thirty - three subjects were identified by POCUS to have mesenteric adenitis in the setting of nonsurgical abdominal pain presenting to our ED. Most common indications for POCUS were for suspected appendicitis, suspected intussusception, or undifferentiated abdominal pain. Forty-six percent of patients were male; median age was 9 years (interquartile range, 4-14 years). On 4-week clinical follow-up, 1 patient returned to our ED with a surgical abdomen. Cohen κ values were 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.97) between experienced sonologist-physicians and 0.76 (95% confidence interval, 0.61-.90) between novice and experienced sonologist-physicians. POCUS can identify mesenteric adenitis, typically a diagnosis of exclusion, in pediatric patients with nonsurgical abdominal pain, both by novice and experienced physician-sonologists. Use of POCUS may help ED clinicians identify a common cause of nonsurgical abdominal pain in children."

    "abstract": "To report the indications and outcomes of emergency keratoplasty over a 21-year period in Greenlane Clinical Centre, the major tertiary eye referral center in Auckland, New Zealand (Aotearoa). A retrospective review of medical records of all emergency keratoplasties performed in Greenlane Clinical Centre from January 2000 to September 2021 was conducted. Demographic, preoperative, intraoperative, and 1-year postoperative data were collected. Emergency keratoplasty was performed in 102 eyes of 97 patients (54 men), comprising 5.6% of transplants performed (N = 1830) in this period. The mean age was 53 years (range = 4-95 years, SD = 20). Patients of Māori ethnicity were overrepresented (31%). Corneal perforation was present in 90% of eyes, and microbial keratitis was the most common indication. Bacteria were the most commonly isolated organisms (38%). The mean preoperative and 12-month postoperative best potential corrected distance visual acuity was 1.6 and 1.2 (logMAR), respectively. All cases of therapeutic keratoplasty achieved initial therapeutic success, with no eyes lost or requiring repeat emergency keratoplasty. Complications included nonhealing epithelial defects (19%), cataract (19%), glaucoma (15%), allograft rejection (13%), and corneal melting (5%). Fifteen cases (15%) had documented graft failure at 12 months. Multivariate analysis revealed that younger age was the only statistically significant factor associated with failure at 12 months. Emergency keratoplasty was the indication for 5.6% of keratoplasties performed. Our results compare favorably with those in the literature, possibly because of early intervention and lower incidence of fungal keratitis. The reported overrepresentation of Māori has important implications for health access and delivery in New Zealand."

    "abstract": "Thiamine deficiency, also known as beriberi, is a nutritional disorder caused by a lack of thiamine (vitamin B1) in the diet. It can occur in 2 forms: dry beriberi, which affects the nervous system, and wet beriberi, which affects the cardiovascular system. Gastrointestinal beriberi is a subtype that affects the digestive system and can lead to multisystem involvement. In the United States (US), thiamine deficiency often arises from chronic malnutrition secondary to alcoholism, known as Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome. A 45-year-old female with no known past medical history or alcohol use disorder came to the emergency department with an altered mental status and with a history of intractable nausea and vomiting for several months prior to presentation. During intake, the medical team discovered she had bilateral lower extremity weakness and an anion gap metabolic acidosis. Her inpatient workup ruled out meningitis, encephalitis, peritonitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, and cerebrovascular accident. A thiamine deficiency was the most probable cause of her presentation, secondary to her protracted history of vomiting and poor oral medication intake. Refeeding syndrome complicated her hospitalization. After replenishing thiamine, the patient experienced significant improvement in mental status and lower extremity weakness. The healthcare team later discharged her with home physical therapy rehabilitation and nutritional counseling. Thiamine deficiency is not common in the US. However, this case highlights the importance of including this deficiency in the differential when a patient arrives with a history of malnourishment secondary to a gastrointestinal illness with signs of altered mental status and neurological symptoms."

    "abstract": "Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is a vital part of the pharmacological management in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). While early discontinuation of DAPT increases ischemic risk, some patients on DAPT may require urgent surgery, necessitating its interruption. Cangrelor, an intravenous P2Y12 antagonist, provides strong platelet inhibition within minutes and platelet activity normalizes within one hour after the cessation of the drug. Bridging antiplatelet therapy with cangrelor has been increasingly studied as an alternative option to ensure the continuation of platelet inhibition in CAD patients who require discontinuation of DAPT. The present patient, with a recent history of PCI for acute coronary syndrome, experienced a significant esophageal perforation following transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). This severe complication was effectively managed endoscopically, and as part of the recent PCI treatment, prolonged cangrelor infusion was successfully utilized with no thrombotic or bleeding events throughout the management of the complication."

However, its safety as an ambulatory procedure (length of stay < 12 h) has not been widely described. A prospective bariatric study of 40 patients undergoing SADI robotic surgery after LSG with same day discharge (SDD), was undertaken in April 2021. Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and the enhanced recovery after bariatric surgery protocol was followed. Anesthesia and robotic procedures were standardized. Early follow-up (30 days) analyzed postoperative (PO) outcomes. Forty patients (37 F/3 M, mean age: 40.3yo), with a mean pre-operative BMI = 40.5 kg/m2 were operated. Median time after LSG was 54 months (21-146). Preoperative comorbidities included: hypertension (n = 3), obstructive sleep apnea (n = 2) and type 2 diabetes (n = 1). Mean total operative time was 128 min (100-180) (mean robotic time: 66 min (42-85)), including patient setup. All patients were discharged home at least 6 h after surgery. There were four minor complications (10%) and two major complications (5%) in the first 30 days postoperative (one intrabdominal abscess PO day-20 (radiological drainage and antibiotic therapy) and one peritonitis due to duodenal leak PO day-1 (treated surgically)). There were six emergency department visits (15%), readmission rate was 5% (n = 2) and reintervention rate was 2.5% (n = 1) There was no mortality and no unplanned overnight hospitalization.

    "abstract": "Fecalomas are a rare potential etiology for constipation experienced in children and the elderly. Large bowel obstructions due to fecalomas are preferably treated conservatively with laxatives and bowel rest. However, in the setting of severe corporostasis, more invasive procedures are required to prevent bowel ischemia and perforation. This case report describes a patient who presented to the emergency department with symptoms of large bowel obstruction and constipation, and she was found to have a fecaloma. Conservative interventions, including bowel rest and the administration of laxatives failed, prompting the need for more invasive therapies. During her admission, multiple flexible sigmoidoscopies were required to alleviate the obstruction. Ultimately, this case demonstrates an encounter of a patient with a sigmoid fecaloma from an unlikely demographic with few risk factors that required endoscopic intervention for treatment."

We present the case of an 18-year-old female who developed retrocecal appendicitis following blunt abdominal trauma, a rare occurrence with significant diagnostic challenges. Initial symptoms mimicked upper abdominal trauma, evolving to classic signs of appendicitis within hours. Despite a negative pre-trauma history of abdominal pain, clinical evaluation led to a suspicion of appendicitis. Contrast-enhanced CT scan confirmed the thickening of the cecal appendix, prompting urgent surgical intervention. An open appendectomy revealed a congested retrocecal appendix, supporting the diagnosis. Our case underscores the importance of considering trauma as a potential trigger for appendicitis, especially in the absence of typical pre-trauma symptoms. Diagnostic criteria for post-trauma appendicitis are evolving, and we underscore a comprehensive clinical assessment alongside imaging modalities. While surgical management remains standard, newer approaches like endoscopic retrograde appendicitis therapy warrant exploration. Further research is essential to refine diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this uncommon presentation, ensuring timely intervention and improved patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Mitral regurgitation (MR) results from retrograde blood flow from the left ventricle to the left atrium. Common etiologies of acute severe MR include papillary muscle rupture from myocardial infarction, leaflet perforation in infective endocarditis, chordal rupture (pop) in myxomatous valve disease, acute rheumatic fever with carditis, or functional MR due to cardiomyopathies, myocarditis or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Here, we present an unusual case of acute severe MR due to ruptured chordae tendineae likely secondary to degenerative valve disease. A 59-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension and renal calculi was evaluated in the outpatient office for a urologic procedure. He was sent to the emergency room with left-sided chest pain, 6/10 in intensity, burning in nature, and non-radiating with no aggravating and relieving factors. He had nausea and vomiting for the past three days. He reported similar chest pain at rest and on exertion multiple times over the past year. He also had a chronic cough with no recent changes. His examination was unremarkable. Chest X-ray showed interstitial lung markings. Electrocardiography revealed an old right bundle branch block, but no ST/T-wave changes. He was admitted and treated for atypical pneumonia with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. The following morning, he complained of persistent chest pain 9/10 in intensity which improved with nitroglycerin. His examination revealed a new onset holosystolic murmur heard over the precordium. A two-dimensional echocardiogram showed a preserved ejection fraction of 55-60%, severe MR with eccentric jet, concerning for partially flail leaflet of the mitral valve. He was transferred to the university hospital for mitral valve replacement. Patients with acute rupture of chordae tendineae usually progress to severe mitral valve regurgitation. These patients usually present with pulmonary edema, signs of heart failure, and cardiogenic shock. Papillary muscle dysfunction, as well as partial or complete rupture of the mitral chordae can be detected as a new-onset holosystolic murmur and can be a crucial sign for early recognition. In our case, the patient developed a new holosystolic murmur on day two of admission which was recognized early, and prompt surgical intervention was performed."

    "abstract": "Abdominal pain is a diagnostic problem that requires immediate care and treatment for surgeons and gynecologists. The causes of abdominal pain in women of childbearing age range from benign and temporary to potentially life threatening. Rare etiologies such as spontaneous ruptured endometrioma are often not included in the radar of diagnosis due to their rarity and non-specific signs and symptoms in the patient. This case report aimed to show a resemblance between the clinical symptoms of acute abdomen in diffuse peritonitis due to hollow viscus perforation and spontaneous ruptured endometrioma. A 42-year-old woman presented to our hospital with abdominal pain. She had a history of fever for two weeks. She came from a tropical rural area where typhoid fever is common. She was advised to undergo emergency laparotomy because of the suspicion of diffuse peritonitis due to a hollow viscus perforation due to typhoid infection. Because of acute abdominal pain, a vertical incision was made to explore her abdominal cavity, and chocolate-like fluid and ovarian cysts were found during surgery. The diagnosis was changed to diffuse peritonitis due to spontaneous rupture of the endometrioma bilaterally. This case suggests that the exact diagnosis and cause of abdominal pain varies. As the current gold standard for endometrioma is laparoscopy, surgeons must prepare a collaborative approach to the cause of the disease. Abdominal pain is common and often requires prompt medical care. In women, it can have various causes, including rare ones, such as spontaneous ruptured endometrioma, which can be difficult to diagnose owing to its rarity and vague symptoms. We describe the case of a 42-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever, initially suspected to have diffuse peritonitis due to typhoid infection. However, surgery revealed a ruptured endometrioma, highlighting the challenge of accurately diagnosing such conditions. This case emphasizes the need to consider the diverse diagnoses of abdominal pain and the importance of collaborative approaches among medical professionals to ensure accurate diagnosis and treatment."

While the JETi Hydrodynamic Thrombectomy System (Abbott) offers a percutaneous approach to fragment and aspirate the thrombus in patients with arterial occlusions, data on its efficacy and safety are limited. This study reports our early experience using the JETi device to treat ALI at our institution. This is a single-center, retrospective review of patients with ALI treated with the JETi device between September 2020 and December 2022. Patients were included if the JETi device was used either as a primary intervention or as an adjunct procedure. The primary endpoint was technical success defined as <50% residual thrombus after intervention. Secondary endpoints included achieving complete resolution of the thrombus on angiogram, acute kidney injury (AKI), major bleeding, 30-day major amputation, and 30-day mortality. A total of 59 JETi procedures for ALI (median age 62 years [interquartile range: 56-71 years]) were performed on 39 male and 20 female patients. The median time from onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 24 hours (interquartile range: 4-168 hours). Rutherford classifications were I (10), IIa (27), IIb (14), and undocumented (8). Etiology of ALI was native vessel thrombosis (27), embolism (16), graft/stent thrombosis (14), and iatrogenic (2). A total of 124 vessels were treated, with an average of 2.1 vessels per procedure. The primary outcome was achieved in 86% (107/124) of the arteries, with 82% (102/124) successfully opened using the JETi device alone without the need for any adjunctive therapy. Complete resolution of the thrombus using JETi was achieved in 81% (101/124) arteries, with or without the use of adjunctive therapy. A total of 6.7% (4/59) patients required a major limb amputation within 30 days despite successful recanalization, and one 30-day mortality was recorded. Complications included distal embolization (5), access site hematoma (2), and AKI (4). No major bleeding, hemolysis-induced AKI, or vessel dissection or perforation was observed. The JETi device appears to be a safe and effective percutaneous treatment option in the management of ALI. It provides definitive treatment with a high technical success rate of 86% and a good safety profile."

Limited studies have explored the relationship between serum hepcidin levels and AA. This study aimed to measure serum hepcidin levels in patients undergoing surgery with a preliminary diagnosis of AA and to assess whether these levels can serve as a biochemical marker for diagnosing AA. This study included patients aged 18 or older who presented to the emergency department between April 2018 and May 2019 and underwent surgery with a diagnosis of AA. The cohort comprised 94 patients with surgical pathology results compatible with AA (Group A), 16 patients with results not compatible with AA (Group B), and 42 healthy controls. Serum hepcidin levels were measured from venous blood samples. Mean hepcidin levels were 1750±285 pg/mL in Group A, 1349±381 pg/mL in Group B, and 1066±225 pg/mL in the control group. Statistically significant differences in serum hepcidin levels were observed between Group A and the control group (p<0.05). Hepcidin levels were significantly higher in patients with AA compared to both the control group and patients with surgically confirmed non-AA pathology. Therefore, hepcidin may serve as a useful adjunct in diagnosing acute appendicitis."

Outcomes compared change in pre- to posttraining scores. ED consultations using VO during this time period were reviewed to detect differences between the presumed diagnosis/treatment based only on phone consultation and VO image compared to the final diagnosis/treatment after in-person Otolaryngology consultation. Forty-six (63.1%) ED residents participated. Diagnostic accuracy improved by 20.7% overall. The most improved diagnoses were of a normal ear canal (+75%), tympanosclerosis (+58.4%), and ear canal foreign body (+57.1%); most challenging were external auditory canal cyst (-13.6%), hemotympanum (-11.3%), and cerumen (-1.9%). Cholesteatoma did not improve because all responses were incorrect; neither did tympanic membrane perforation because all were correct. Confidence in the otologic exam and anatomy also increased (P < .01). Thirteen consults used VO and 3 (23.1%) had a change in diagnosis/treatment after in-person Otolaryngology evaluation. Training on the use of VO significantly improves the confidence and diagnostic skills of ED providers for many pathologies. This application suggests the efficacy of an otologic e-consultation model."

We present the case who underwent subtotal gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction for advanced gastric cancer. After that surgery, we diagnosed DSF due to pancreatic fistula, and performed reoperation because of hemodynamic instability due to diffuse peritonitis and sepsis. We resected the stump and closed with handsewn suturing and inserted three intra-abdominal drainage tubes, including a dual drainage tube around the duodenal stump. Although there was a recurrence of DSF, because of the continuous and absolute drainage, the patient improved and discharged on postoperative Day 59. From this experience, diligent debridement and a continuous suction dual drainage system, intraluminal drain of the duodenum, and biliary diversion may be an effective surgical management for DFS."

    "abstract": "Infectious mononucleosis (IM) is a viral illness caused by the Epstein-Barr virus that typically manifests with pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, and fatigue. In rare cases, IM can cause acute appendicitis. We present the case of an 18-year-old female who arrived at the emergency department with worsening abdominal pain and an ongoing cough. Initial imaging showed a questionably dilated appendix, and a follow-up examination revealed cervical lymphadenopathy. She later returned to the ED with severe abdominal pain, clinical signs of acute appendicitis, and a positive monospot test, which led to an appendectomy. This case illustrates the need for complete history taking and thorough physical examination in patients with acute appendicitis, as their condition may be due to an atypical underlying cause."

    "abstract": "Distinguishing between ruptured and non-ruptured acute appendicitis presents a significant challenge. This study aimed to validate the accuracy of RAMA-WeRA Risk Score in predicting ruptured appendicitis (RA) in emergency department. This study was a multicenter diagnostic accuracy study conducted across six hospitals in Thailand from February 1, 2022, to January 20, 2023. The eligibility criteria included individuals aged >15 years suspected of acute appendicitis, presenting to the ED, and having an available pathology report following appendectomy or intraoperative diagnosis by the surgeon. We assessed the screening performance characteristics of RAMA-WeRA Risk Score, in detecting the ruptured appendicitis (RA) cases. 860 patients met the study criteria. 168 (19.38%) had RA and 692 (80.62%) patients had non-RA. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AuROC) of RAMA-WeRA Risk Score was 75.11% (95% CI: 71.10, 79.11). The RAMA-WeRA Risk Score > 6 points (high-risk group) demonstrated a positive likelihood ratio (LR) of 3.22 in detecting the ruptured cases. The sensitivity and specificity of score in > 6 cutoff point was 43.8% (95%CI: 36.2, 51.6) and 86.4% (95%CI: 83.6, 88.9), respectively. The RAMA-WeRA Risk Score can predict rupture in patients presenting with suspected acute appendicitis in the emergency department with total accuracy of 75% for high-risk cases."

    "abstract": "Transmesenteric internal hernia is an uncommon cause of small bowel obstruction that occurs when small bowel loops protrude through a mesenteric defect into the abdominal cavity. Herein, we present an unexpected case of colonoscopy-induced transmesenteric internal hernia. An 81-year-old male patient presenting with intermittent hematochezia and constipation had undergone a laparoscopic left nephrectomy for ureteral cancer. A colonoscopy was performed to identify the etiology of his symptoms. He complained of severe abdominal pain 2 h after the examination despite uneventful endoscopic procedures, including cold snare polypectomy. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a strangulated small bowel obstruction with a closed-loop formation outside the descending colon. The small bowel loop was incarcerated into the left retroperitoneal space. Emergency laparotomy detected small bowel loops that prolapsed into the nephrectomy pedicle via a descending mesenteric defect, developed during the laparoscopic left nephrectomy. The incarcerated small bowel was detached from the hernia and returned to its normal position, and the mesenteric defect was closed. He demonstrated an uneventful postoperative course, with no internal hernia recurrence after discharge. This case indicates the risk of transmesenteric internal hernia through inadvertently created mesenteric defects should be borne in mind, especially when performing colonoscopies in patients who underwent laparoscopic nephrectomies."

Chromosome analysis showed t (8;14)(q24;q32) and t (11;14)(q13;q32). Treatment with daratumumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone resulted in partial response, but the disease relapsed, with a copy number increase in t (11;14) and abnormal amplification of the 1q21 region. The patient was treated for CMV enteritis, and was admitted to the hospital due to sudden abdominal pain. Gastrointestinal perforation was diagnosed by CT scan showing free air and wall thickening in the small intestine. Emergency surgery was performed, and the tumors in the perforated area were positive for CCND1 but negative for MYC on immunostaining. The patient's general condition did not improve after the surgery and he died. Pathological autopsy revealed extramedullary infiltration of multiple organs in addition to the small intestine. Extramedullary infiltration is thought to be caused by clonal evolution, and further research is warranted to clarify its pathogenesis and establish effective therapeutic strategies in high-risk patients."

    "abstract": "Appendicectomy is the most frequent emergency general surgical procedure. Prior research highlights the importance of histopathology analysis after appendicectomy which is the practice in many countries including the United Kingdom (UK), aiming to prevent any oversight of vital findings and the avoidance of potential delays in patient care. Our primary objective was to audit the extent to which surgeons adhere to the NHS England patient safety guidelines from 2016 when it comes to timely reviewing and effectively communicating histopathology results to patients and/or their general practitioners following appendicectomy procedures. Our secondary objective was to amend practice, if deemed necessary, following the implementation of agreed-upon protocols, with the expected improvements being observable in the second cycle of the audit. In our two-cycle audit, we performed a retrospective analysis using online patient records from a single centre in the UK. The initial cycle involved cases of emergency appendectomies carried out consecutively for suspected appendicitis from April 2018 to June 2019. Following the clinical governance meeting and the implementation of recommendations, the second audit cycle covered cases between September 2020 and October 2020. In the first cycle, among 418 laparoscopic appendectomies, 207 (49.52%) and 47 reports (11.24%) were reviewed within a 15-day and a 16-30-day window, respectively, following the online availability of histopathology results. Notably, 116 reports (27.75%) remained unreviewed by surgeons, and only 67 (16.02%) of these reports documented communication with patients and/or their general practitioners. In the second cycle, involving 49 patients, 38 reports (77.55%) were reviewed within the first 15 days, and 10 reports (20.4%) were reviewed between 16-30 days. Among these, 16 reports (32.65%) documented communication with patients and/or their general practitioners. Our adherence to the aforementioned guidance was poor prior to this audit. This two-cycle audit highlighted the need for improvement in the timely review and communication of histopathology reports following appendectomy at our centre. The second cycle showed promising progress, suggesting that changes implemented between the cycles had a positive impact. Nevertheless, continuous efforts may be required to enhance and sustain adherence to these vital patient safety guidelines."

The incidence of perforation is 0.03%-0.65% in diagnostic colonoscopy; however, the incidence can be up to 10 times higher in therapeutic interventions, such as polypectomies, increasing the risk of complications up to 0.07-2.1%. Materials and methods. Case report of a 71-year-old female who presents a rare complication due to a perforation in the sigmoid which developed pneumoperitoneum, pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, and massive subcutaneous emphysema as a complication of a diagnostic colonoscopy where a biopsy of a friable lesion was performed. A 71-year-old female that went to the emergency room due to acute generalized abdominal colic spasm pain with a duration of 7 hours, associated with significant abdominal distension, malaise, diaphoresis, progressive dyspnea, and massive subcutaneous emphysema that developed after performing panendoscopy and colonoscopy for diverticulosis follow-up. An abdominal CT scan with double contrast was performed, reporting suggestive data of hollow viscus perforation, pneumoperitoneum, pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, and massive subcutaneous emphysema in the thorax, neck, and skull base. She underwent an exploratory laparotomy finding a perforation in the sigmoid for which sigmoidectomy was performed, and for the pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum, endopleural tubes were placed in both hemithoraxes. The massive subcutaneous emphysema subsided with observation and oxygen. A rare complication of the use of colonoscopy as a diagnostic and therapeutic method is presented. The purpose of presenting this case is for the doctor who performs these interventions to suspect this complication in a timely manner, not delaying the diagnosis and carrying out an urgent therapeutic approach as in this case with exploratory laparotomy, finding the perforation site and carrying out the corresponding surgical management. We demonstrated that massive subcutaneous emphysema can be managed with observation if there is no other alarm data evident that required another surgical approach."

It occurs when there is an accumulation of mucous in the lumen of the appendix. We present three cases: a 48-year-old male admitted to the emergency room with a one-day history of right iliac fossa pain. Abdominal examination was suggestive of acute appendicitis. The initial abdominal computerised tomography scan was reported as being unremarkable. At surgery, a firm tumour of the appendix was found, and a limited right hemicolectomy was done. Histopathology confirmed a mucocoele of the appendix with borderline mucinous histology.The second case is a 63-year-old man who presented with a one-year history of abdominal distension and weight loss. Previous abdominal ultrasound was suggestive of liver cirrhosis with significant ascitic fluid. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging found an appendix mucocoele with infiltration of the omentum and scalloping of the liver surface suggestive of pseudomyxoma peritonei. A percutaneous biopsy of the omental mass confirmed metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix.The third case is a 68-year-old man who, during an annual medical check-up, had an incidental finding of a cystic right iliac fossa mass on ultrasound, confirmed on abdominopelvic computerised tomography scan to be an appendix mucocele. He had laparoscopic appendicectomy. The histopathological diagnosis confirmed a mucinous cystadenoma of the appendix. Preoperative diagnosis of appendiceal mucocoele is difficult and commonly discovered intraoperatively. The prognosis is good for the histologically benign type, but it is poor when malignant or peritoneal lesions are present. None declared."

    "abstract": "Acute mesenteric ischemia is a critical condition marked by a sudden loss of blood supply to the intestines, often leading to rapid tissue necrosis and severe clinical outcomes if untreated. In the context of hypogammaglobulinemia, an immunodeficiency characterized by decreased levels of immunoglobulins, this vascular emergency becomes even more daunting. Hypogammaglobulinemia can impair the immune system's response to both infection and ischemic injury, intensifying the severity of intestinal damage. This report describes the case of a 52-year-old female with hypogammaglobulinemia who presented with severe abdominal pain. Surgical exploration revealed 100 cm of necrotic small bowel extending from 150 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz to within 10 cm of the ileocecal valve. The necrotic section was surgically removed, and primary anastomosis was performed. This instance highlights the significant impact of immunodeficiency on the progression and management of acute mesenteric ischemia, demonstrating the critical need for early intervention and tailored management strategies, especially in immunocompromised patients, to prevent severe outcomes. The case illuminates the importance of recognizing immunodeficiency as a complicating factor in acute gastrointestinal emergencies, stressing the necessity for prompt and effective medical and surgical interventions to improve prognosis and patient outcomes in complex clinical scenarios."

    "abstract": "Adenocarcinoma, while constituting the predominant variant among small bowel cancers, is a component of the broader category of primary small bowel malignancies, which are notably infrequent in occurrence. The diagnosis of such malignancies is often markedly delayed, a consequence of their insidious onset and the nonspecific nature of the abdominal symptoms presented. A 69-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department manifesting acute, sharp, and colicky abdominal pain accompanied by a single episode of vomiting, all developing over one day. His medical history was notable for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and regionally confined prostate adenocarcinoma, which was under meticulous surveillance by the urological team. The patient's lifestyle was characterized by abstention from alcohol and tobacco, adherence to a nutritious diet, and a commitment to regular physical activity. Subsequent examination and surgical excision of an abnormal mass, as delineated on computed tomography (CT), culminated in the diagnosis of a stage IV, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. We have reported this case to spark research regarding early diagnostic techniques for small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA). In this case, a healthy individual presented with vague abdominal pain and a single episode of vomiting. Diagnosis required the surgical resection of the tumor, where metastasis was also visualized. Due to the rare nature of SBA, we believe different diagnostic measures and adjuvant therapy should be researched for earlier diagnosis and subsequently better patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "The source of abdominal pain in patients with a history of gastric bypass can be difficult to determine. Synchronous disease processes may ultimately be the cause of their symptoms. Among the etiologies for hematemesis and obstruction in this population are the diagnoses of marginal ulcer and internal hernia. Given the potential complications of bariatric surgery, it is important to maintain a broad differential diagnosis during the workup of these patients. A female with history of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) presented with abdominal pain and hematemesis. Intraoperative findings revealed intussusception of the jejunojejunostomy resulting in obstruction and ischemic bowel. Additionally, a perforated marginal ulcer of the Roux-limb was found to be present. This patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, bowel resection, jejunojejunostomy revision, and Graham patch repair. This case highlights a patient with history of RYGB presenting with obstruction and gastrointestinal bleeding. Although initially diagnosed with internal hernia and Mallory-Weiss hematemesis, surgical exploration revealed concurrent intussusception and marginal ulceration. While intussusception is a rare complication of bariatric surgery, it can occur secondary to mesenteric thinning and motility dysfunction from significant weight loss. It is imperative to maintain a broad differential diagnosis for the causes of obstruction and GI bleeding that include adhesive disease, abdominal wall hernia, internal hernia, intussusception, and marginal ulcers. Findings of obstruction or GI bleeding after bariatric surgery may represent a surgical emergency. While these symptoms may be attributed to a single diagnosis, clinicians must consider the presence of synchronous pathologies during the workup of patients."

Our aims were (i) to describe our local practice and (ii) to evaluate the efficiency of performing ultrasound (US) and/or computed tomography (CT) by assessing management failure, specificity and sensitivity, and length of stay in the emergency department (ED). This single-center retrospective study included all patients who underwent US or CT for the management of suspected AA. Patients were included if they were admitted to the ED in February or June between 2012 and 2021. The study included 339 patients. US was performed in 278 patients (82%), of whom 91 also had a second-line CT (31.3%). There was a significant increase in the rate of CT over the inclusion period. Three percent (3%) of the patients had management failure and a higher age and CT or US + CT were significantly associated with the risk of management failure. Length of stay in the ED increased significantly when a second-line CT was performed. The sensitivity and specificity of US were 84.8% and 93.2%, respectively. Sensitivity was significantly different from CT (100%, p = 0.03) but not specificity (87.9%, p = 0.29). Both US and CT results were more likely to be considered for further management if positive. The vast majority of patients with negative or inconclusive results were admitted in surgical wards or underwent a second-line examination. If available in the hospital together with CT, US should probably be performed systematically and as a first-line examination in patients with suspected acute appendicitis."

This case describes a 49-year-old female with a past medical history of hiatal hernia and biliary dyskinesia who presented to the emergency department with severe epigastric and right lower quadrant abdominal pain one day after a reported gastrointestinal illness of unknown etiology. Initial emergency department workup demonstrated an elevated white blood cell count without lactic acidosis. Computed tomography imaging was interpreted as gastric distension with volvulus around the mesentery and second portion of the duodenum. Intraoperatively, the entirety of the right colon was noted to have passed through the foramen of Winslow into the lesser sac. This led to twisting of the mesocolon causing compression of the duodenum and a gastric outlet obstruction. After surgical reduction of the herniation, the patient noted great improvement in pain and other symptoms."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common non-obstetric reason for exploratory laparotomy during pregnancy. This case report involves a primigravida patient who presented to the emergency department of the General Hospital of Trikala at 15 weeks of gestation due to diffuse abdominal pain, primarily in the epigastric region. She also reported watery bowel movements. The ongoing atypical clinical symptoms, along with elevated inflammatory markers, strongly indicated a diagnosis of acute appendicitis. An immediate exploratory laparotomy was performed, during which acute localized inflammation of the appendix was found, leading to an appendectomy. Histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The patient reported pain relief immediately after the surgery. On the fourth postoperative day, she was discharged without any signs of a threatened second-trimester miscarriage. At 39 gestational weeks, she delivered by elective cesarean section due to breech presentation. This paper discusses the case and highlights the significant challenges in the early diagnosis and management of acute appendicitis during pregnancy, emphasizing the importance of preventing potentially life-threatening complications for both the mother and the fetus."

We hypothesized that patients with a higher grade of suspected SBO on CT scan would be more likely to require surgical intervention. Retrospective chart review of patients who presented to the Emergency Room (ER) who had a CT of the abdomen and pelvis for suspected SBO. Patients were divided into 5 groups: Grade 1 (SBO unlikely), Grade 2 (probable partial or early SBO), Grade 3 (probable high grade SBO), Grade 4 (SBO with changes concerning for ischemia) and Not Graded. The CT scans of 655 patients were graded. Of the 22 patients with a grade 1 SBO, only 1 went for surgery (4.5 %). For grade 2 patients, 23 out of 299 had an operation (7.7 %), for grade 3 it was 84 out of 299 (28.1 %) and for grade 4 SBO, 25 out of 35 patients (71.4 %) had surgery. The p value is <0.00001. The three most common intraoperative findings were SBO obstruction from adhesions alone (48 % of cases), followed by incarcerated hernias (12 %) and ischemic bowel (9 %). Only 8 cases out of 133 operations (6 % of total) had no findings at time of surgery other than dilated bowel. The CT grading scale for SBO developed at our institution shows excellent correlation between grade and going for surgery, with few negative results, and can be a useful tool among other factors for general surgeons when deciding whether or not to operate on a patient with suspected SBO."

We hypothesized that identifying variability in the application of operative management could highlight a potential pathway to improve patient survival and outcomes. We included adults aged 65+ years with an EGS condition from the 2016-2017 National Inpatient Sample. Operative management was determined from procedure codes. Each patient was assigned a propensity score (PS) for the likelihood of undergoing an operation, modeled from patient and hospital factors: EGS diagnosis, age, gender, race, presence of shock, comorbidities, and hospital EGS volumes. Low and high probability for surgery was defined using a PS cut-off of 0.5. We identified two model-concordant groups (no surgery-low probability, surgery-high probability) and two model-discordant groups (no surgery-high probability, surgery-low probability). Logistic regression estimated the adjusted OR (AOR) of in-hospital mortality for each group. Of 375 546 admissions, 21.2% underwent surgery. Model-discordant care occurred in 14.6%; 5.9% had no surgery despite a high PS and 8.7% received surgery with low PS. In the adjusted regression, model-discordant care was associated with significantly increased mortality: no surgery-high probability AOR 2.06 (1.86 to 2.27), surgery-low probability AOR 1.57 (1.49 to 1.65). Model-concordant care showed a protective effect against mortality (AOR 0.83, 0.74 to 0.92). Nearly one in seven EGS patients received model-discordant care, which was associated with higher mortality. Our study suggests that streamlined treatment protocols can be applied in EGS patients as a means to save lives. III."

During the two study periods, 855 appendectomies were performed, 427 in the pre-pandemic, and 428 during the pandemic. Demographic data were comparable between groups. There was statistically no significant difference in the type of appendectomy (p = 0.33) and the median hospital length of stay (3; (2-5) days, p = 0.08). There was an increase in the conversion rate during the pandemic period (4.2% vs. 7.7%, p = 0.03). The negative appendectomy rate and the incidence of perforated AA did not differ significantly (p = 0.34 for both). We did not observe a significant increase in the rate of AA complications during the COVID-19 pandemic at the UHC Zagreb. This may be attributed to two factors: (1) AA was diagnosed and treated as an emergency, which remained available during the pandemic, and (2) diagnostic and therapeutic protocols remained unaltered.

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common abdominal emergency observed in emergency departments (ED). Distinguishing between uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis is important in determining a treatment strategy. Serum soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) is an inflammatory biomarker. We aimed to determine the role of VCAM-1 in predicting complicated appendicitis in children. Pediatric patients with suspected appendicitis admitted to the ED were enrolled in this prospective study. Pre-surgical serum VCAM-1 was tested in children with acute appendicitis within 72 h of symptoms (from day 1 to day 3). Serum VCAM-1 levels were further analyzed and compared between patients with and without complicated appendicitis. Among the 226 pediatric appendicitis patients, 70 had uncomplicated appendicitis, 138 had complicated appendicitis, and 18 had normal appendices. The mean serum VCAM-1 levels in patients with perforated appendicitis were higher than in those with simple appendicitis (p < 0.001). On day 1 to day 3, the mean VCAM-1 levels in patients with complicated appendicitis were all significantly higher than in those with uncomplicated appendicitis (all p < 0.001). Serum VCAM-1 levels may be helpful in differentiating uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis in children and could predict appendiceal perforation."

    "abstract": "Mesenteric ischemia diagnosis is challenging, with an overall mortality of up to 50% of cases despite advances in treatment. The main problem that affects the outcome is delayed diagnosis because of non-specific clinical presentation. Multi-Detector CT Angiography (MDCTA) is the first-line investigation for the suspected diagnosis of vascular abdominal pathologies and the diagnostic test of choice in suspected mesenteric bowel ischemia. MDCTA can accurately detect the presence of arterial and venous thrombosis, determine the extent and the gastrointestinal tract involved, and provide detailed information determining the subtype and the stage progression of the diseases, helping clinicians and surgeons with appropriate management. CT (Computed Tomography) can differentiate forms that are still susceptible to pharmacological or interventional treatment (NOM = non-operative management) from advanced disease with transmural necrosis in which a surgical approach is required. Knowledge of CT imaging patterns and corresponding vascular pathways is mandatory in emergency settings to reach a prompt and accurate diagnosis. The aims of this paper are 1. to provide technical information about the optimal CTA (CT Angiography) protocol; 2. to explain the CTA arterial and venous supply to the gastrointestinal tract and the relevant ischemic pattern; and 3. to describe vascular, bowel, and extraintestinal CT findings for the diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia."

    "abstract": "Intestinal obstruction is a common surgical emergency with high morbidity and mortality. Patients presenting with features of small bowel obstruction need urgent evaluation to avoid complications such as bowel gangrene, perforation, or peritonitis. Imaging is necessary in most cases of suspected bowel obstruction, to take an appropriate decision, for apt patient management. Among the common causes of small bowel obstruction, adhesions, external herniae, malignancies, and Crohn's disease top the chart. Imaging helps in determining the presence of obstruction, the severity of obstruction, transition point, cause of obstruction, and associated complications such as strangulation, bowel gangrene, and peritonitis. This review is based on the cases with unusual causes of bowel obstruction encountered during our routine practice and also on the extensive literature search through the standard textbooks and electronic databases. Through this review we want our readers to have sound knowledge of the imaging characteristics of the uncommon yet important causes of bowel obstruction. We have also revisited and structured a checklist to simplify the approach while reporting a suspected case of small bowel obstruction. Imaging plays a key role in the diagnosis of small bowel obstruction and in determining the cause and associated complications. Apart from the common causes of small bowel obstruction, we should also be aware of the uncommon causes of small bowel obstruction and their imaging characteristics to make an accurate diagnosis and for apt patient management."

    "abstract": "Luminal strictures, common in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially Crohn's disease (CD), are typically treated with endoscopic balloon dilatation (EBD). The newer endoscopic stricturotomy (ESt) approach shows promise, but data is limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis assess the effectiveness and safety of ESt in IBD-related strictures. A comprehensive literature search was conducted until November 2023 for studies assessing ESt efficacy and safety in IBD. Primary outcomes were clinical and technical success, with secondary endpoints covering adverse events, subsequent stricture surgery, additional endoscopic treatments (ESt or EBD), medication escalation, disease-related emergency department visits, and hospitalization post-ESt. Technical success was defined as passing the scope through the stricture, and clinical success was defined as symptom improvement. Single-arm meta-analysis (CMA version 3) calculated the event rate per patient with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was evaluated using I2. Nine studies were included, involving 640 ESt procedures on 287 IBD patients (169 CD, 118 ulcerative colitis). Of these, 53.3% were men, with a mean age of 43.3 ± 14.3 years and a mean stricture length of 1.68 ± 0.84 cm. The technical success rate was 96.4% (95% CI 92.5-98.3, p-value < 0.0001), and the clinical success rate was 62% (95% CI 52.2-70.9, p-value = 0.017, I2 = 34.670). The bleeding rate was 10.5% per patient, and the perforation rate was 3.5%. After an average follow-up of 0.95 ± 1.1 years, 16.4% required surgery for strictures post-ESt, while 44.2% needed additional endoscopic treatment. The medication escalation rate after ESt was 14.7%. The disease-related emergency department visit rate was 14.7%, and the disease-related hospitalization rate post-procedure was 21.3%. Our analysis shows that ESt is safe and effective for managing IBD-related strictures, making it a valuable addition to the armamentarium of endoscopists. Formal training efforts should focus on ensuring its widespread adoption."

    "abstract": "To describe the unique finding and treatment of a dog with cardiac herniation due to traumatic pericardial rupture. A 6.5-year-old entire male Yorkshire Terrier was presented for further management after being hit by a car. Despite suspected significant intrathoracic trauma at that time, the patient regained hemodynamic stability and had orthopedic surgery to correct a right iliac fracture. The patient was readmitted to the hospital 12 days following the initial visit due to considerable respiratory difficulty after accidentally being dropped several feet. Thoracic radiographs revealed an unusual severe mediastinal shift to the left with an atypical position of the cardiac silhouette against the left lateral thoracic wall. Due to the severe respiratory compromise of the patient and newly developed pneumothorax, an exploratory thoracotomy was recommended, where a complete rupture of the pericardium was identified, with secondary left-sided prolapse of the heart. Other more common intrathoracic injuries (ie, lung perforation, rib fractures) were also identified and partially repaired. The patient recovered successfully and was discharged 4 days postoperatively. This is the first case report in the veterinary literature of traumatic pericardial rupture and cardiac herniation. According to human case descriptions, this is a rare and often fatal occurrence, which can be significantly challenging to diagnose preoperatively or antemortem. Emergency veterinary clinicians should be aware of this rare but important complication of blunt thoracic trauma. Surgical intervention may be necessary in cases with suspected or confirmed entrapment of great vessels or cardiac chambers, although these abnormalities were not present in this case."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in pregnant women. There has been a wide variance in clinical practice worldwide, with some favoring an antibiotic-only approach while others prefer surgery as the first-line management. Therefore, we designed the current analysis to synthesize the available evidence on the efficacy and safety of antibiotics versus surgery management. Methods: We searched PubMed, Scopus, EuropePMC, and Cochrane Central from March 4, 1904 until November 25, 2022, to look for studies comparing antibiotics and surgery in pregnant patients with acute appendicitis. We only included studies that provided a comparison between the two treatments. We included preterm delivery, fetal loss, maternal death, and complications as outcomes. The results were compared using an odds ratio and 95% confidence interval. We also performed a sensitivity analysis by excluding studies with a serious risk of bias. Results: We included five non-randomized studies for the analysis. We found that patients in the antibiotic group had a lower risk of preterm labor (OR 0.63 [95% CI 0.43-0.92]; p 0.02) but a higher risk of complications (OR 1.79 [95% CI 1.19-2.69]; p 0.005). We did not find any difference in the other outcomes. Conclusion: The increased risk of complications should caution clinicians about using antibiotics as the first-line management. More studies are required to identify patients who would benefit the most before antibiotics could be adopted as a treatment for acute appendicitis in pregnant patients."

Barium sulfate is a contrast agent that may be used to enhance certain imaging studies. Although barium-contrasted studies are generally safe, they are not without risk for complications. Barium impactions, and their management, are infrequently reported in scientific literature. We present a case of a patient with barium impaction who presented at the emergency room after a fall from standing with associated symptoms of abdominal pain, weakness, and fatigue. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan performed on presentation revealed the barium impaction, and initial attempts at conservative management were unsuccessful. A decompressive colonoscopy was performed without successful dissolution of the barium. Ultimately, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, which revealed a contained perforation of the sigmoid colon, and a successful partial colectomy with end colostomy was performed. This case study explores the surgical management of barium impaction in a comorbid patient."

This retrospective cohort study analyzed the data of 70 patients who underwent emergency surgery for colorectal perforations between January 2017 and December 2023. The surgical outcomes of the patients who underwent open and laparoscopic surgeries were statistically compared. The primary endpoints were postoperative mortality and complications. The secondary endpoints included blood loss, surgical time, length of hospital stay, and 1-year overall survival. Overall, 28 patients underwent open surgery and 42 underwent laparoscopic surgery. No significant difference was noted in the postoperative mortality or overall rate of severe complications between the two groups. The incidence of superficial and deep incisional surgical site infection was lower in the laparoscopic surgery group (35.7% vs. 0.0%, p < 0.001), while the surgical time was significantly longer in the laparoscopic group (175.6 ± 92.2 min vs. 290.0 ± 102.3 min, p < 0.001). No significant differences were found in blood loss, length of hospital stay, or 1-year overall survival. Laparoscopic surgery for colorectal perforation markedly reduced superficial and deep incisional surgical site infection, with no substantial difference in mortality or severe complications."

    "abstract": "Since introducing new and alternative treatment options may increase decisional conflict, we aimed to describe the use of the decision support tool (DST) and its impact on treatment preference and decisional conflict. For the treatment of appendicitis, antibiotics are an effective alternative to appendectomy, with both approaches associated with a different set of risks (eg, recurrence vs surgical complications) and benefits (eg, more rapid return to work vs decreased chance of readmission). Patients often have limited knowledge of these treatment options, and DSTs that include video-based educational materials and questions to elicit patient preferences about outcomes may be helpful. Concurrent with the Comparing Outcomes of Drugs and Appendectomy trials, our group developed a DST for appendicitis treatment ( www.appyornot.org ). A retrospective cohort including people who self-reported current appendicitis and used the AppyOrNot DST between 2021 and 2023. Treatment preferences before and after the use of the DST, demographic information, and Ottawa Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) were reported after completing the DST. A total of 8243 people from 66 countries and all 50 U.S. states accessed the DST. Before the DST, 14% had a strong preference for antibiotics and 31% for appendectomy, with 55% undecided. After using the DST, the proportion in the undecided category decreased to 49% ( P < 0.0001). Of those who completed the Ottawa Decisional Conflict Score (DCS; n = 356), 52% reported the lowest level of decisional conflict (<25) after using the DST; 43% had a DCS score of 25 to 50, 5.1% had a DCS score of >50 and 2.5% had and DCS score of >75. The publicly available DST appyornot.org reduced the proportion that was undecided about which treatment they favored and had a modest influence on those with strong treatment preferences. Decisional conflict was not common after use. The use of this DST is now a component of a nationwide implementation program aimed at improving the way surgeons share information about appendicitis treatment options. If its use can be successfully implemented, this may be a model for improving communication about treatment for patients experiencing emergency health conditions."

There are a variety of etiologies of small bowel obstruction. Infrequently, small bowel malignancies can first present as small bowel obstruction. In exceedingly rare cases, leiomyosarcomas can be the offending malignancy. A 53-year-old male presented to the emergency department with several weeks of persistent right abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Computed tomography scan revealed a central necrotic mass within the right lower quadrant originating from the small bowel. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy to relieve the obstruction and a mass was identified originating from the terminal ileum that adhered to surrounding structures. Pathological analysis determined the mass to be small bowel leiomyosarcoma. Leiomyosarcoma is definitively diagnosed after primary resection with histopathology and immunohistochemistry. As opposed to other small bowel neoplasms, surgical resection with negative margins is the only potentially curative option."

    "abstract": "Pediatric upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy is an important procedure in the management of gastrointestinal pathologies. Conventionally, it has been the forte of medical gastroenterologists. However, unlike adults, the availability of pediatric gastroenterologists is limited, especially during emergency hours. We present our early experience of UGI endoscopy done by the department of pediatric surgery. The aim of this study was to study the feasibility and benefits of UGI endoscopy by pediatric surgeons. A retrospective descriptive study was carried out by the department of pediatric surgery of a tertiary-level medical college, from January 2017 to January 2022. Data were collected from electronic and physical medical records. Parameters included age, gender, indication for endoscopy, and procedures done endoscopically or based on endoscopic findings and complications. One hundred and thirty endoscopies were done in 95 patients aged 1-16 years, from January 2017 to January 2022. The most common indication for UGI endoscopy was esophageal stricture (71 procedures in 41 patients), followed by UGI foreign body (18 cases). All other indications were mostly diagnostic, other than four patients with achalasia. Thirty of these patients underwent UGI endoscopy as an emergency procedure. Seventeen patients were followed through or had added procedures, with UGI endoscopy. There was one perforation when dilating an esophageal stricture who responded to conservative management. UGI endoscopy is a valuable diagnostic and therapeutic procedure, which can be performed by pediatric surgeons after necessary training. It supplements decision-making in management, avoids waste of time in referring, avoids additional anesthesia, and is valuable in emergencies."

We report a case of a 79-year-old male who initially presented with altered mental status and stroke-like symptoms; he was ultimately diagnosed with abdominal wall NF spreading to the lower extremity. Despite a history of cecal mass perforation noted in prior imaging, the patient had been discharged from an outside emergency room on antibiotics, highlighting a missed opportunity for early intervention. Subsequent deterioration led to sepsis, organ failure, and ultimately, the detection of NF. Prompt recognition of subtle skin changes and laboratory abnormalities, along with a detailed physical examination, is essential for a timely and accurate diagnosis. Surgical debridement, coupled with broad-spectrum antibiotics, remains the cornerstone of treatment. Delays in surgical management significantly increase mortality, emphasizing the importance of prompt diagnosis and intervention. This case underscores the necessity for heightened awareness among healthcare providers to recognize NF promptly, especially when its clinical presentation overlaps with other critical conditions. Multidisciplinary collaboration and continued education are imperative to improve outcomes and prevent delays in the diagnosis and treatment of NF."

Initial evaluation suggested appendicitis, further supported by laboratory findings and diagnostic imaging revealing a retrocecal appendix with surrounding inflammation. Remarkably, an FB, a fish bone, was discovered lodged within the perforated appendix, elucidating the unusual etiology. Emergency laparotomy confirmed the diagnosis and facilitated prompt surgical intervention.

We aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of DFC versus immediate fascial closure (IFC) in EGS patients with intra-abdominal contamination. This retrospective study was conducted using the 2013-2020 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Adult EGS patients who underwent an exploratory laparotomy with intra-abdominal contamination [wound classification III (contaminated) or IV (dirty)] were included. Patients with agreed upon indications for DFC were excluded. A propensity-matched analysis was performed. The primary outcome was 30-d mortality. We identified 36,974 eligible patients. 16.8% underwent DFC, of which 51.7% were female, and the median age was 64 y. After matching, there were 6213 pairs. DFC was associated with a higher risk of mortality (15.8% versus 14.2%, P = 0.016), pneumonia (11.7% versus 10.1%, P = 0.007), pulmonary embolism (1.9% versus 1.6%, P = 0.03), and longer hospital stay (11 versus 10 d, P < 0.001). No significant differences in postoperative sepsis and deep surgical site infection rates between the two groups were observed. Subgroup analyses by preoperative diagnosis (diverticulitis, perforation, and undifferentiated sepsis) showed that DFC was associated with longer hospital stay in all subgroups, with a higher mortality rate in patients with diverticulitis (8.1% versus 6.1%, P = 0.027). In the presence of intra-abdominal contamination, DFC is associated with longer hospital stay and higher rates of mortality and morbidity. DFC was not associated with decreased risk of infectious complications. Further studies are needed to clearly define the indications of DFC."

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of pediatric digestive volvulus, including the presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence. Pediatric digestive volvulus is a deadly condition most commonly associated with malrotation. It occurs when the stomach or small intestine twists on itself, resulting in ischemia and potentially strangulation with necrosis and perforation. Presentation differs based on the gastrointestinal (GI) segment affected, degree of twisting, and acuity of the volvulus. Gastric volvulus most commonly presents with retching with or without nonbilious emesis and epigastric distension with pain, while midgut volvulus typically presents with bilious emesis in infants. Patients with GI necrosis and perforation may present with hemodynamic compromise and peritonitis. If suspected, emergent consultation with the pediatric surgery specialist is necessary, and if this is not available, transfer to a center with a pediatric surgeon is recommended. Imaging includes plain radiography, ultrasound, or upper GI series, while treatment includes resuscitation, administration of antibiotics, and emergent surgical decompression and detorsion of the involved segments. An understanding of pediatric digestive volvulus and its many potential mimics can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this deadly disease."

Jejunal GISTs causing perforation and acute diffuse peritonitis is rare. A 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension presented with severe, acute abdominal pain and vomiting. Examination revealed abdominal distension, tenderness, and guarding, with imaging suggestive of gastrointestinal perforation. Emergency laparotomy revealed a 9 cm × 8 cm mass with perforation in the jejunum, which was resected which on histopathological examination confirmed a low-grade GIST. The postoperative course was complicated by a wound infection, managed with antibiotics and secondary suturing. At one-year follow-up, the patient remained disease-free without the need for adjuvant therapy. The most common symptoms of jejunal GISTs include vague abdominal pain or discomfort, early satiety, obstruction or hemorrhage. Preoperative diagnosis and confirmation of GIST is difficult due to nonspecific symptoms and none of the radiographic procedures can establish the diagnosis with certainty. The surgical excision of the tumor along with infiltrated tissues is the treatment of choice for GIST. This case underscores the necessity of considering GISTs in differential diagnoses of acute abdomen and the critical role of prompt surgical management and multidisciplinary care in achieving favorable outcomes."

In general, these are associated with serious intra-abdominal processes that result in emergency surgeries with bowel resections. Below, we present the case of an 80-year-old woman, diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer under treatment with fulvestrant and ribociclib, who was admitted to our center due to abdominal pain and vomiting. She was diagnosed with intestinal pneumatosis and pneumoperitoneum, so she underwent exploratory laparotomy for suspected intestinal ischemia. There was no evidence of intestinal necrosis or perforation, so resection was not performed. She progressed satisfactorily during hospitalization and in the tomographic control one month after discharge there was complete resolution of the condition. Although this condition has been described in relation to episodes of increased intra-abdominal pressure, such as emesis, it has also been described in patients with neoplasms, mainly of the digestive tract, either due to local damage or toxicity associated with chemotherapy. We found no reports in the literature of pneumatosis intestinalis linked to this antineoplastic medication in humans. Probably in our case the etiology was multifactorial. It is possible that ribociclib played a role, either through an indirect mechanism associated with vomiting and immunosuppression or directly on the enterocyte due to its non-specific cellular mechanism of action. La neumatosis intestinal y el neumoperitoneo no son entidades patológicas en sí mismas, son signos radiológicos que resultan de alguna condición subyacente. En general, estos se asocian con procesos graves intraabdominales que resultan en cirugías de urgencias con resecciones de intestino. A continuación, presentamos el caso de una mujer de 80 años, con diagnóstico de cáncer de mama estadio IV en tratamiento con fulvestrant y ribociclib, que ingresó a nuestro centro por dolor abdominal y vómitos. Se diagnosticó neumatosis intestinal y neumoperitoneo por lo que se procedió a laparotomía exploradora por sospecha de isquemia intestinal. No hubo evidencia de necrosis o perforación intestinal por lo que no se realizó resección. Evolucionó durante la internación de forma satisfactoria y en el control tomográfico al mes del egreso hubo resolución completa del cuadro. Si bien está descrito esta afectación en relación a los episodios de aumento de presión intraabdominal, como en la emesis, también se describió en pacientes con neoplasias, principalmente del tubo digestivo, ya sea por daño local o por toxicidad asociada a la quimioterapia. No encontramos reportes en la literatura de neumatosis intestinal vinculada a esta medicación antineoplásica en humanos. Probablemente en nuestro caso la etiología haya sido multifactorial.

    "abstract": "Background Intestinal perforation is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate surgical intervention. Surgical-site infections (SSIs) and wound dehiscence are common complications associated with emergency laparotomy for intestinal perforation. Finding optimal wound management and postoperative strategies can significantly impact patient outcomes and reduce the risk of complications. Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a relatively recent tool employed in the care of wounds to control SSIs and foster healing. Methodology A prospective, observational, cohort study was conducted among 150 patients who underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy due to intestinal perforation at the general surgery department of a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi between July 2022 and December 2023. Preoperatively, all patients underwent initial resuscitation. Intraoperatively, the extent of peritonitis was determined and was categorized according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classification. Postoperatively, NPWT dressing was applied to the patient's midline laparotomy wound on postoperative day (POD) two. Negative pressure was set at 75-125 mmHg with suction. The number of NPWT dressing changes required was documented. The wound was closed with vertical mattress sutures under local anesthesia, delayed primary closure (DPC). The incidence of SSIs, the duration for DPC, the incidence of fascial dehiscence, the number of NPWT dressing changes, and the length of hospital stay were documented according to CDC groups. Results The mean age in CDC categories 2, 3, and 4 were 31.789, 28.733, and 42.676 years, respectively. The most common cause of perforation was enteric fever (n = 42, 28%), followed by tuberculosis (n = 36, 24%). Most patients had no known comorbidities (n = 80, 53.3%). Overall, 16% of patients (n = 24) were both alcoholics and smokers. The most frequent bacteria in all CDC categories was Escherichia coli. Fourteen patients developed burst abdomen in the postoperative period and were excluded from the study. The mean duration of DPC increased with higher CDC categories, with CDC category 4 displaying the most extended mean duration at 10.70 days. The number of NPWT dressing changes increases with higher CDC categories, with CDC category 4 exhibiting the highest mean at 2.00 changes. The mean hospital stay increased with higher CDC categories, with CDC category 4 showing the most extended mean stay at 17.324 days. Statistical analysis revealed no significant association between SSI occurrence and CDC categories. Conclusions NPWT followed by DPC is a promising approach to managing gastrointestinal perforations, reducing SSIs, and potentially improving patient outcomes. However, further research is needed to explore the specific benefits of NPWT in conjunction with DPC and its efficacy in various clinical scenarios."

    "title": "Surgical repair of an aortoesophageal fistula after salvage thoracic endovascular aortic repair: a case report.",
    "abstract": "An aortoesophageal fistula can prove to be fatal. Salvage thoracic endovascular aortic repair as a bridging therapy and radical surgery with thoracotomy should be considered while treating aortoesophageal fistula without spontaneous closure. Moreover, it is essential to select a technique that reduces the risk of reinfection. Here we report a rare case of a ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysm related to esophageal perforation by a fish bone that led to massive hematemesis and shock, and the surgical treatment of an aortoesophageal fistula that developed after salvage thoracic endovascular aortic repair. A 70-year-old Japanese female patient was admitted with hematemesis, thoracic pain, and shock related to esophageal perforation of a ruptured descending aortic aneurysm caused by fish bone aspiration and esophageal perforation 1 month previously. An emergency thoracic endovascular aortic repair was performed. Postoperatively, an aortoesophageal fistula that remained open and a food intake-related increase in the inflammatory response was noted. Radical blood-vessel prosthesis implantation and fistula closure were performed. The patient's postoperative course was favorable and the patient was discharged 22 days after the blood vessel prosthesis implantation. Such a case of rupture of a descending aortic aneurysm related to perforation by a fish bone and an aortoesophageal fistula is considerably rare. Thus, we report the therapeutic strategy of this particular case and review the relevant literature."

    "abstract": "The recovery of gastrointestinal function and postoperative ileus are the leading goals for clinicians following surgery for adhesive small bowel obstruction. While enhanced recovery programs may improve recovery, their feasibility in emergency surgery has not yet been proven. We sought to assess the incidence of postoperative ileus in patients following surgery for ASBO and the feasibility of enhanced recovery programs, including their benefits in the recovery of gastrointestinal functions and reducing the length of hospitalization. This prospective study includes the first 50 patients surgically treated for ASBO between June 2021 and November 2022. Their surgery was performed either as an emergency procedure or after a short course of medical treatment. The main aim was to compare the observed rate of postoperative ileus with a theoretical rate, set at 40%. The study protocol was registered in clinicaltrials.gov under the number NCT04929275. Among the 50 patients included in this study, it reported postoperative ileus in 16%, which is significantly lower than the hypothetical rate of 40% (p = 0.0004). The median compliance with enhanced recovery programs was 75% (95%CI: 70.1-79.9). The lowest item observed was the TAP block (26%) and the highest observed items were preoperative counselling and compliance with analgesic protocols (100%). The overall morbidity was 26.5%, but severe morbidity (Dindo-Clavien > 3) was observed in only 3 patients (6%). Severe morbidity was not related with the ERP. Enhanced recovery programs are feasible and safe in adhesive small bowel obstruction surgery patients and could improve the recovery of gastrointestinal functions. NCT04929275. WHAT DOES THE STUDY CONTRIBUTE TO THE FIELD?: Perioperative management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) surgery needs to be improved in order to reduce morbidity. Enhanced recovery programs (ERP) are both feasible and safe following urgent surgery for ASBO. ERPs may improve the recovery of gastrointestinal (GI) functions."

    "abstract": "Emergencies and emergency surgeries are a central part of everyday surgical care in Germany. However, it is unclear how emergency surgery is practically trained in clinics on a daily basis and what training concept is underlying. Therefore, the aim of this survey study was to capture the status quo of emergency surgical training of German general and visceral surgeons. The members of the German Society for General and Visceral Surgery were surveyed online (n = 5281). The questionnaire included demographic data and expertise in surgery and assistance in emergency surgery regarding common emergency surgical operations. In addition, further training measures in emergency surgery and their support by employers were queried. Only complete questionnaires (n = 184, response rate 3.5%) were included in the analysis. Most participants were in training (n = 69; 38%), followed by senior physicians (n = 52; 29%), specialists (n = 31; 17%) and chief physicians (n = 30; 17%). 64% of the participants were employed at university hospitals or maximum care hospitals. Regarding further training opportunities, in-clinic shock room training was most frequently used. Outside of their own clinic, the ATLS course was most frequently mentioned. Operations for cholecystitis and appendicitis as well as emergency stoma procedures are the most common emergency procedures. There was a strong difference in the frequency of operated cases depending on the level of training. For operations to treat acute abdominal traumas (hemostasis of liver and spleen, packing) as well as outside of visceral surgery, only low competence was reported. Over 90% of survey participants consider emergency surgery to be an indispensable core competence. Neither in the old (76%) nor in the new training regulations (47%) is emergency surgery adequately represented according to the participants' assessment. There was a significantly lower prevalence of the \"sub-steps concept\" in emergency surgery at 38% compared to elective surgery (44%). Important elements of imparting skills in emergency surgery are simulation and courses as well as operative sub-steps, according to the majority of survey participants. The results show that general and visceral surgeons in Germany are introduced to emergency surgery too little structured during further training and at specialist level. The survey participants had, as expected, hardly any experience in emergency surgery outside of visceral surgery but surprisingly also little experience in visceral surgical trauma care. There is a need to discuss the future organization of emergency surgical training. Adequate simulation structures and extracurricular courses could contribute to an improvement in this respect."

    "abstract": "Most patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) in the United States are on automated PD (APD) utilizing several liters of PD solution daily for their treatment. The ordering, delivery, and storage of PD solutions can be challenging and is an important factor that can dissuade patients from doing PD. The generation of PD solutions at home is a strategy that could potentially be used to overcome this problem. The APD Solution Generation System (SGS) allowed for PD solution generation using tap water in patients' homes. In this study, we set out to evaluate the performance of the SGS in prevalent, adult patients with end-stage kidney disease, who are on maintenance PD. We evaluated the primary safety (microbiological testing) and efficacy (chemical composition) of the product water generated by the SGS device. Twenty-two patients from 12 different United States centers were enrolled, of which 14 patients completed the study. The results of the primary safety and efficacy end point analyses of the product water showed that all 64 samples met the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) specifications. Secondary safety analysis found a total of 34 adverse events (AEs) in 12 patients. Of these AEs, 3, namely, culture negative peritonitis, bacterial peritonitis, and atrial fibrillation were deemed serious treatment-emergent AEs. This study demonstrated that the SGS can successfully generate PD solution in patients' homes, while meeting chemical composition and ISO microbiological standards. Lessons learned from this clinical trial will be useful in optimizing product development and future clinical trials."

    "abstract": "Treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) has been revolutionized by the arrival of biotherapies and technical progress in interventional endoscopy and surgery. (Sub)total emergency colectomy is required in the event of complicated severe acute colitis: colectasis, perforation, hemorrhage, organ failure. Corticosteroid therapy is the reference treatment for uncomplicated severe acute colitis, while infliximab and ciclosporin are 2nd-line treatments. At each step, before and after each line of treatment failure, surgery should be considered as an option. In cases refractory to medical treatment, the choice between surgery and change in medication must weigh the chronic symptoms associated with the disease against the risks of postoperative complications and functional sequelae inherent to surgery. Detection of dysplastic lesions necessitates chromoendoscopic imaging with multiple biopsies and anatomopathological verification. Endoscopic treatment of these lesions remains reserved for selected patients. These different indications call for multidisciplinary medical-surgical discussion. Total coloproctectomy with ileo-anal anastomosis (TCP-IAA) is the standard surgery, and it holds out hope for healing. Modalities depend on patient characteristics, previous emergency colectomy, and presence of dysplasia. It may be carried out in one, in two modified, or in three phases. The main complications are anastomotic fistula, short-term pouch-related fistula, ileo-anal pouch syndrome, pouchitis and long-term digestive and sexual disorders. For selected cases, an alternative can consist in total colectomy with ileo-rectal anastomosis or permanent terminal ileostomy. The objective of this update is to clarify the indications, modalities, and results of surgical treatment of ulcerative colitis in accordance with the most recent data in the literature."

    "title": "Perforated Peptic Ulcer: A Case Report of a Dreaded Complication of an Insidious Disease.",
    "abstract": "Perforated peptic ulcers, though relatively rare, represent critical surgical emergencies with potentially life-threatening consequences. Their significance lies not only in their acute presentation but also in the diagnostic challenges they pose, particularly in patients with complex medical histories. Here we present a case of a 71-year-old female with a complex medical history, including insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, dementia, diverticulitis, and chronic back pain, who initially were unresponsive and cyanotic. Despite challenges in diagnosis due to her medical complexity and opioid use, she was ultimately diagnosed with a perforated duodenal ulcer. Tragically, despite immediate surgical intervention, she succumbed to her illness, highlighting the complexities involved in managing perforated peptic ulcers, especially in patients with multiple chronic medical conditions. Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) can often remain asymptomatic, leading to delayed diagnosis and potentially life-threatening complications like perforation. Mortality rates associated with perforated peptic ulcers vary widely, ranging from 1.3% to 20%, with risk factors including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, Helicobacter pylori infection, smoking, and corticosteroid use. Diagnosis necessitates a high index of suspicion, thorough clinical examination, and imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) scans with oral contrast. Treatment strategies range from nonoperative management with intravenous (IV) histamine H2-receptor blockers or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to surgical intervention, depending on the patient's hemodynamic stability. However, the case presented underscores the challenges in timely diagnosis and intervention, particularly in patients with complex medical histories, where symptoms may be masked or attributed to other comorbidities. Recent studies indicate a demographic shift toward older age and a higher prevalence among females, emphasizing the importance of increased awareness and vigilance among healthcare providers. Early recognition of symptoms, prompt investigation, and interdisciplinary collaboration are crucial in optimizing outcomes for patients presenting with perforated peptic ulcers, especially in the context of their underlying medical conditions."

    "abstract": "An 8-month-old intact male domestic shorthair cat was referred to the Emergency Service of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) of the Department of Veterinary Science of the University of Parma (Italy) from the Parma municipal multi-cat shelter, during the winter season (January 2023), for lethargy, anorexia, hypothermia, and hypoglycemia. At the VTH, upon cardiologic examination, an increase in heart rate, under normal blood pressure conditions, was detected. Signalment, clinical history, basal metabolic panel (BMP), ultrasound investigations, and cytological findings were all consistent with a diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). FIP was confirmed in the effusive abdominal fluid by a molecular genetic test (real-time PCR for feline coronavirus RNA). The molecular genetic investigation also detected an FCoV S gene single-nucleotide mutation: biotype M1058L. At necropsy, an effusive collection was recorded in the abdomen, thoracic cavity, and pericardium sac. White parenchymal nodules, of about 1 mm diameter, were found on the surface and deep in the lungs, liver, kidneys, and heart. Histopathology revealed the typical FIP pyogranulomatous vasculitis and IHC confirmed the presence of the FIP virus (FIPV) antigen. The most relevant histopathological finding was the myocarditis/myocardial necrosis associated with the presence of the S gene-mutated FCoV (M1058L biotype). This is the first case of myocarditis in a cat positive for the FCoV/FIP M1058L biotype. Further studies are necessary to support the mutated FCoV M1058L biotype, as an uncommon, but possible, causative pathogen of myocarditis in FCoV/FIP-positive cats. Studies including several FCoV/FIP M1058L-positive cases could allow us to make a correlation with heart gross pathology, histopathology, and immunolocalization of the FCoV/FIP M1058L biotype in the myocardium. The investigation will potentially allow us to determine the effective tropism of the FCoV/FIP M1058L biotype for myocardiocytes or whether myocardiocyte lesions are evident in the presence of concomitant causes related to the patient, its poor condition, or external environmental distress such as cold season, and whether the aforementioned concomitant events are correlated."

    "abstract": "Major emergency abdominal surgery is associated with severe postoperative complications and high short- and long-term mortality. Despite recent advancements in standardizing multidisciplinary care bundles, a subgroup of patients continues to face a heightened risk of short-term mortality. This study aimed to identify and describe the high-risk surgical patients and risk factors for short-term postoperative mortality. In this study, we included all patients undergoing major emergency abdominal surgery over 2 years and collected data on demographics, intraoperative variables, and short-term outcomes. The primary outcome measure was short-term mortality and secondary outcome measures were pre, intra, and postoperative risk factors for premature death. Multivariable binary regression analysis was performed to determine possible risk factors for short-term mortality. Short-term mortality within 14 days of surgery in this cohort of 754 consecutive patients was 8%. Multivariable analysis identified various independent risk factors for short-term mortality throughout different phases of patient care. These factors included advanced age, preoperative history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, and vascular bowel ischemia or perforation of the stomach or duodenum during the primary surgery. Patients at high risk of early mortality following major emergency abdominal surgery exhibited distinct perioperative risk factors. This study underscores the importance of clinicians identifying and managing these factors in high-risk patients to ensure optimal care."

    "abstract": "Laparoscopic Nissen Fundoplication is an effective standard surgical procedure for treatment of severe GERD. While it is generally safe and effective, a rare but potentially fatal complication known as acute gastric volvulus can occur following this procedure. A 28-year-old male, ten months post Laparoscopic Nissen Fundoplication presented with a one-day history of severe epigastric pain, abdominal distention, unproductive retching, and difficulty in breathing. Examination revealed tachypnea, subcutaneous emphysema and a tender distended abdomen. Imaging studies showed a left pneumothorax, pneumoperitoneum, and a grossly distended stomach. Emergency exploratory laparotomy confirmed organoaxial gastric volvulus, necrosis of the greater curvature and gastric perforation. Partial gastrectomy and anterior gastropexy were performed. A left thoracostomy tube was placed to drain the left pneumothorax. He recovered fully post-operatively with complete resolution of all symptoms. Acute Gastric volvulus post Laparoscopic Nissen Fundoplication is attributed to adhesions, gastrostomy tubes, and foreign bodies like sutures. Life-threatening complications, such as gastric perforation, can ensue, underscoring the need for swift diagnosis and treatment. Acute gastric volvulus following Laparoscopic Nissen Fundoplication is a rare condition, and is difficult to diagnose. Given the steadily increasing rates of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplications performed in Uganda, maintaining a high index of suspicion is crucial for favorable patient outcomes among patients with this potentially fatal complication."

    "abstract": "The rupture of splenic artery pseudoaneurysm (SAP) is life-threatening disease, often caused by trauma and pancreatitis. SAPs often rupture into the abdominal cavity and rarely into the stomach. A 70-year-old male with no previous medical history was transported to our emergency center with transient loss of consciousness and tarry stools. After admission, the patient become hemodynamically unstable and his upper abdomen became markedly distended. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography performed on admission showed the presence of a splenic artery aneurysm (SAP) at the bottom of a gastric ulcer. Based on the clinical picture and evidence on explorative tests, we established a preliminary diagnosis of ruptured SAP bleeding into the stomach and performed emergency laparotomy. Intraoperative findings revealed the presence of a large intra-abdominal hematoma that had ruptured into the stomach. When we performed gastrotomy at the anterior wall of the stomach from the ruptured area, we found pulsatile bleeding from the exposed SAP; therefore, the SAP was ligated from inside of the stomach, with gauze packing into the ulcer. We temporarily closed the stomach wall and performed open abdomen management, as a damage control surgery (DCS) approach. On the third day of admission, total gastrectomy and splenectomy were performed, and reconstruction surgery was performed the next day. Histopathological studies of the stomach samples indicated the presence of moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma. Since no malignant cells were found at the rupture site, we concluded that the gastric rupture was caused by increased internal pressure due to the intra-abdominal hematoma. We successfully treated a patient with intragastric rupture of the SAP that was caused by gastric cancer invasion, accompanied by gastric rupture, by performing DCS. When treating gastric bleeding, such rare causes must be considered and appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic strategies should be designed according to the cause of bleeding."

This case study presents the rare case of a patient who developed mesenteric ischaemia after an emergency thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) for a type B aortic dissection (TBAD) and peri-operative cardiogenic shock. Study outcomes revealed that intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) identified early mucosal damage two days before the clinical presentation. A 43 year old male patient was admitted to the emergency department with an acute TBAD and a dissection of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), for which TEVAR was performed with additional stent placement in the SMA. Peri-operatively, the patient went into cardiogenic shock with a sustained period of hypotension. Post-operatively, the plasma I-FABP levels were measured prospectively, revealing an initial increase on post-operative day five (551.1 pg/mL), which continued beyond day six (610.3 pg/mL). On post-operative day seven, the patient developed a fever and demonstrated signs of peritonitis and bowel perforation. He underwent an emergency laparotomy, followed by an ileocaecal resection (<100 cm) with a transverse ileostomy. Pathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of mesenteric ischaemia. The diagnosis of NOMI in critically ill patients is often complicated, and the currently available diagnostic markers lack the specificity and sensitivity to detect early intestinal injury. This case report highlights that elevated I-FABP in plasma levels may indicate the presence of early mesenteric injury. Further research needs to be conducted before I-FABP can be applied in daily practice."

    "abstract": "Despite improvements in management, infective endocarditis (IE) is still associated with high mortality and morbidity. The outcome of patients with IE remains unclear in high-altitude areas of China. To characterize the epidemiological features and surgical outcomes, a retrospective analysis was conducted to 221 patients diagnosed with IE from a single center. In addition, to assess the prognosis of patients, a multivariate logistic regression model was performed to analyze the affecting risk factors. A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of 221 patients with IE who underwent surgical treatment at the Department of Cardiac Surgery of Yan'an Hospital Affiliated to Kunming Medical University from January 2013 to December 2019. The analysis evaluated patient demographics, pathogenic bacterial composition, echocardiography results, and surgical treatment outcomes. After a 1-year follow-up period, the mortality rate was statistically analyzed. The patients were divided into two groups based on their survival status: those who survived and those who did not. Relevant factors were compared between the two groups, and a multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyze the risk factors that affect the prognosis of patients with IE. Out of the 221 patients diagnosed with IE, 164 were male and 57 were female, with an average age of 39.25±14.36 years. The most common underlying heart diseases were bicuspid aortic valve disease (24.9%), congenital heart disease (19.5%), rupture of aortic sinus aneurysm (5.0%) and rheumatic valvular disease (2.3%). The blood culture had a positive rate of 48.42% (107/221), with Streptococcus viridans (29.9%) and Streptococcus haematoides (13.1%) being the main specifically pathogenic bacteria identified. Transthoracic echocardiography produced positive results in 89.6% (198/221) of cases. The findings included vegetation formation (100%), valve perforation or tear (21.7%), and perivalvular abscess formation (5.6%). Out of the patients, 174 underwent elective surgery, 47 received emergency surgery, and 11 died within 1 year after surgery, resulting in a mortality rate of 5.0%. However, the death group had longer operation time, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time and higher EuroSCORE II compared to the non-death group (P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis identified preoperative hematocrit decrease, prolonged operation time and CPB time, high New York Heart Association (NYHA) cardiac function grade, and liver diseases as risk factors for 1-year mortality in patients with IE (OR =1.003, 0.000, 1.006, 1.026, 1.624 and 4.746). IE primarily affects young and middle-aged men with rheumatic heart valvular disease as the main underlying heart disease and Streptococcus viridans as the main pathogen. Surgical intervention significantly reduces early mortality in IE patients. To improve postoperative prognosis, clinicians should remain vigilant, especially in high-risk groups with preoperative hematocrit, prolonged operation time, and CPB time, high NYHA cardiac function grade, EuroSCORE II, and vegetation formation."

The clinical presentation of sigmoid volvulus can be observed as nausea, constipation, abdominal distension, and abdominal pain. It is also reported to be insidious. Additionally, it causes blood obstruction, resulting in necrosis, bowel ischemia, and even intestinal perforation if not addressed on time. Physical symptoms might vary depending on the course of the disease but are usually observed as the classical trio of abdominal distension, abdominal pain, and constipation. Computed tomography imaging presents the sign of an inverted U, or classic coffee bean, aiding in the diagnosis of the sigmoid volvulus. A 38-year-old male was admitted to the emergency department of our tertiary care center with significant complaints of obstipation and abdominal pain. The medical history and physical examination revealed peritoneal symptoms, which warranted a prompt radiological imaging diagnosis.

We present a case of a 70-year-old male with diabetes type 2, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease with hemodialysis, who attended the emergency department with sudden-onset abdominal pain in the epigastrium. The patient presented no additional symptoms, a normal electrocardiogram, but due to the characteristics of the pain and elevated troponin I, emergency medicine specialists considered an acute coronary syndrome and initiated antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy. Due to persistent abdominal pain, a decrease in hemoglobin, and the onset of arterial hypotension, a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which revealed perforation of the gallbladder, apparent hemorrhagic cholecystitis, and hemoperitoneum. The patient underwent emergent surgery, where CT findings were confirmed. In our case, the suspicion of hemorrhagic cholecystitis arose until the clinical case was advanced, after receiving anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy, and it was confirmed during surgery and with histopathology. This concludes that hemorrhagic cholecystitis is a rare disease and difficult to diagnose. Therefore, studies should focus on clinical presentation and risk factors (e.g., trauma, malignancy, renal failure, cirrhosis, and anticoagulation therapy) to promote early diagnosis and avoid complications."

    "title": "Management of LVAD in Cerebral Salt-Wasting Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "The use of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) is now commonplace in the management of nonischemic cardiomyopathy. LVADs are preload-dependent and afterload-sensitive, meaning rapid changes in a patient's volume status can significantly impact device function. Cerebral salt-wasting syndrome (CSWS), a rare cause of hyponatremia, is characterized by an acute increase in urine output and low serum sodium. Here, we present the case of a 43-year-old man with end-stage heart failure supported by an LVAD, who experienced refractory low-flow alarms due to CSWS. The patient initially presented with a new-onset headache. Brain computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an acute subdural hematoma with midline shift, requiring emergency craniotomy, which was performed without complications. After discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU), he returned with multiple low-flow alarms on his LVAD (flow less than 1.5 L/h), despite high mean arterial pressures and normal perfusion indexes. Laboratory evaluation showed a serum sodium of 130 mmol/L, a urine osmolality of 522 mmol/kg, a serum osmolality of 282 mmol/kg, and a urine sodium of 147 mEq/day. His urine output was 4 L/day. A diagnosis of CSWS was made. Treatment included normal saline drip for 1:1 volume replacement, daily fludrocortisone, low-dose desmopressin, and intermittent 3% hypertonic saline boluses. Salt tablets were prescribed to maintain a serum sodium goal of 135-140 mmol/L and a urine output of 2.5-3.5 L/day. Over time, the frequency of low-flow alarms decreased significantly, and the patient was discharged. CSWS is an unlikely cause of hyponatremia in the ICU. Aggressive fluid hydration and sodium supplementation are necessary for positive clinical outcomes. This is especially true in patients with LVADs, who are both preload-dependent and afterload-sensitive. Failure to rapidly treat CSWS can lead to respiratory arrest, brainstem herniation, and even death."

    "abstract": "Fungal endocarditis carries a high mortality rate, with intracranial multifocal hemorrhage representing a severe yet rarely reported complication. We present a case of a 60-year-old female with a history of rheumatic valvular disease who underwent bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement and developed fungal endocarditis with vegetation formation 12 years postoperatively. Following antifungal therapy, the patient underwent redo mitral valve replacement. The postoperative course was complicated by acute subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cerebral herniation, necessitating emergent burr hole drainage. Multidisciplinary management achieved hemodynamic stabilization, though with residual neurological deficits including hemiplegia and dysphagia.This case highlights the critical risk of fatal intracranial hemorrhage during the perioperative period of fungal endocarditis, underscoring the need for enhanced monitoring and proactive intervention. The clinical course provides valuable insights for managing such life-threatening complications."

    "abstract": "The spot sign is a well-established radiologic marker associated with hematoma expansion and poor clinical outcomes in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. However, its role in traumatic intracranial hemorrhages remains insufficiently characterized. We report the case of a 67-year-old man who sustained a severe traumatic brain injury following a collision with a bicycle-driven cart. On presentation, his Glasgow Coma Scale score was 3T, with anisocoria (right pupil 1.5 mm; left pupil 4 mm). Computed tomography angiography revealed concurrent spot signs in a left-sided acute subdural hematoma (SDH) and a right temporal contusion. Emergent left decompressive craniectomy was performed for the SDH. Due to progressive hematoma expansion, a contralateral craniectomy was subsequently required for the temporal contusion. This case highlights the rare concurrence of spot signs in two distinct traumatic intracranial hemorrhages. Recognition of this imaging feature may enhance prognostication and guide urgent neurosurgical interventions in traumatic brain injury with multiple traumatic intracranial hemorrhages."

    "title": "Acute Subdural Hematoma Without Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Due to Traumatic Aneurysm of the Posterior Cerebral Artery.",
    "abstract": "Acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) typically results from high-energy head trauma, such as motor vehicle accidents or severe falls. It can also be caused by minor head injuries in elderly individuals due to damage to bridging veins or small arteries, but it is considerably rarer in younger patients. A previously healthy 39-year-old man presented with progressive headaches and consciousness disturbance. The emergent computed tomography (CT) revealed ASDH covering most of the left cerebral hemisphere without subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). CT angiography (CTA) showed an irregularly shaped aneurysm at a distal branch of the left posterior cerebral artery (PCA) (quadrigeminal segment (P3 segment)/cortical segment (P4 segment)), suggesting that ASDH was caused by aneurysmal bleeding of the PCA. Digital subtraction angiography performed after a left decompressive craniectomy showed the aneurysm observed on CTA was suspected to be a pseudo-aneurysm, and parent artery occlusion was performed. This report presents a rare case of ASDH in a young individual without a history of head trauma. Our case highlights the importance of considering aneurysm rupture as a potential etiology in patients with ASDH without SAH, particularly in the absence of a history of head trauma."

    "abstract": "Sinking flap syndrome (SFS) is a well-documented but typically delayed complication of decompressive craniectomy (DC). Early-onset SFS, especially within hours of surgery, is extremely rare and may pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. In this report, we describe a unique case of SFS occurring just 2 h after DC in the context of an intraoperative air embolism and prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation, underscoring the impact of acute hemodynamic disturbances on SFS pathogenesis. We present the case of an 84-year-old female with a history of hypertension and chronic aspirin use who underwent DC for a left temporo-parietal acute subdural hematoma. Intraoperatively, the patient experienced cardiac arrest requiring resuscitation. Postoperatively, she was intubated for 1 h and then extubated. At postoperative h 2, the scalp flap was observed to be sunken. On regaining consciousness, she was found to have new-onset right hemiplegia. Once hemodynamically stabilized, cranial computed tomography was performed at postoperative h 6 and confirmed SFS. Emergent cranioplasty was performed using the autologous bone flap. Neurological improvement was noted in the following days, and the patient was discharged with partial motor recovery and active rehabilitation plans. Although usually delayed, SFS can present as early as 2 h post-DC, particularly in the setting of intraoperative hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion. Prompt recognition and intervention are crucial to prevent long-term neurological deficits."

    "title": "Evaluation of the Direction of External Force Input to the Skull and Its Influence on the Severity of Traumatic Brain Injury.",
    "abstract": "Recent demographic changes in Japan have led to an increasing incidence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) resulting from low-energy mechanisms such as falls among the elderly. However, the influence of the direction of external force input on the severity of head injury has not been well characterized in clinical cohorts. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the direction of cranial impact and the severity of TBI, with particular attention to the anatomical fracture site and the need for emergency neurosurgical intervention. This retrospective cohort study included 231 patients with blunt head trauma admitted to Gunma University Hospital between April 2018 and March 2023. The impact direction was classified as longitudinal or transverse according to injury patterns and prehospital documentation. Skull fractures were categorized into five anatomical regions: frontal, parietal, occipital, temporal, and basilar skull. The primary outcomes were the occurrence of severe TBI, defined as head AIS ≥ 5, and the performance of emergency craniotomy. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), controlling for age and antithrombotic use. Model calibration was verified using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and sensitivity analysis was conducted by comparing minimally adjusted and primary models. Among the included patients, 70% sustained injuries due to falls, and more than half were aged ≥ 65 years. The proportion of severe TBI was higher in the transverse impact group (23%) than in the longitudinal group (13%). Temporal and basilar skull fractures were independently associated with severe TBI (temporal: OR 3.84, 95% CI 1.63-9.05; P = 0.002; basilar: OR 7.61, 95% CI 2.78-20.9; P < 0.001) and emergency craniotomy (temporal: OR 3.13, 95% CI 1.29-7.16; P = 0.011; basilar: OR 2.90, 95% CI 1.00-8.36; P = 0.049). No significant group differences were observed in mortality at 14, 30, or 180 days. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 18.2% (42/231), comparable to previously reported rates in moderate-to-severe TBI cohorts. The median Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE0 at 180 days did not differ significantly between groups (P = 0.289), although survivors in the transverse group had better functional outcomes (P = 0.042). Temporal and basilar skull fractures, as well as transverse impact mechanisms, are associated with higher injury severity and a greater likelihood of emergency craniotomy but are not independent predictors of mortality. These findings suggest that the direction of cranial impact provides important biomechanical insight into injury severity and may aid in prehospital triage and preventive strategies for head trauma in aging populations."

    "title": "Risk Stratification for Early Seizures after Traumatic Brain Injury: A Clinical Scoring Model for Prediction and Management.",
    "abstract": "Early seizures within 1 week after traumatic brain injury (TBI) are classified as acute symptomatic seizures, which can worsen secondary brain injury, leading to poor neurological outcomes and increased mortality. Despite prophylactic antiepileptic drug (AED) use, early seizures remain prevalent, particularly in severe cases. This study aims to identify risk factors for early seizures in patients with TBI receiving prophylactic levetiracetam monotherapy and to develop a clinical scoring model for risk stratification. This study was conducted at an emergency medical center in Japan (2018-2022). In total, 168 patients with TBI were screened, and 147 severe cases met eligibility criteria. Exclusion criteria included age under 18, prehospital cardiac arrest, prior AED use, pregnancy, and alcohol dependency. All patients received prophylactic levetiracetam, with dosage and duration determined by neurocritical care physicians. The primary outcome was early seizures and associated risk factors. Secondary outcomes included hospital stay, functional outcomes, and in-hospital mortality. Multivariate logistic regression identified independent risk factors, and a clinical risk scoring model was developed. Early seizures occurred in 25 of the 147 patients. Multivariate analysis identified heart rate (odds ratio [OR]: 1.048, p < 0.001), creatinine level (OR: 1.535, p = 0.026), and acute subdural hematoma (OR: 5.861, p = 0.027) as independent risk factors. A clinical risk scoring model incorporating these variables demonstrated high predictive accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.828, 95% confidence interval: 0.725-0.931). Patients scoring >4.5 underwent electroencephalographic monitoring. This study presents a novel risk scoring model integrating heart rate, creatinine, and acute subdural hematoma to predict early seizures in patients with TBI despite prophylactic levetiracetam use. The model enables rapid risk stratification upon admission and may guide targeted neurocritical management."

    "title": "Recurrent Subdural Hematoma Revealing Undiagnosed Mild Hemophilia A and Factor XIII Deficiency in an Elderly Patient.",
    "abstract": "Recurrent acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) is uncommon and typically associated with trauma, vascular malformations, or coagulopathies. While hemophilia is usually diagnosed in childhood, mild forms may remain undetected until adulthood, potentially presenting with unexpected perioperative bleeding. We report the case of a 75-year-old male who sustained a traumatic head injury resulting in ASDH along the falx cerebri and left frontotemporal region. Initial conservative management was followed by neurological deterioration associated with worsening cerebral edema, requiring emergent craniotomy. Postoperative rebleeding occurred twice, necessitating a total of three craniotomies. A coagulation workup after the second reoperation revealed decreased factor VIII ([FVIII] 22%) and factor XIII ([FXIII] 53%) activity. Although FVIII activity had not been checked initially, it remained consistently low during follow-up. The FVIII inhibitor test was negative, and a cross-mixing test supported the diagnosis of congenital hemophilia A. Genetic testing was not performed due to cost and patient preference. After initiating FVIII and FXIII replacement therapy, cranioplasty was performed without further bleeding. The patient recovered with minimal neurological deficits and remains functionally independent. This case underscores the need to consider undiagnosed congenital hemophilia in elderly patients with recurrent ASDH or unexplained postoperative rebleeding. Early, targeted coagulation studies, including FVIII and FXIII assays, are critical for diagnosis. Our findings suggest that even mild FXIII deficiency may exacerbate bleeding in hemophilia A, highlighting the limitations of routine coagulation tests. Adequate perioperative replacement of FVIII and FXIII can support safe neurosurgical outcomes."

    "title": "Acute Surgery vs Conservative Treatment for Traumatic Acute Subdural Hematoma.",
    "abstract": "It is unclear whether performing surgery for most patients with an acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) is superior to conservative treatment. To compare the effectiveness of a strategy preferring acute surgical ASDH evacuation with one preferring initial conservative treatment. This comparative effectiveness study used data from February 1, 2014, to July 31, 2018, from the prospective observational Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury Study, conducted at 18 Level 1 trauma centers in the US. The study included patients with nonpenetrating TBI presenting to the emergency department and admitted within 24 hours after injury with ASDH detected on acute head computed tomography scan. Statistical analysis was performed from December 1, 2022, to December 20, 2024. Acute surgical hematoma evacuation vs initial conservative treatment, comparing outcomes between centers according to treatment preferences, measured by the case mix-adjusted probability of undergoing acute surgery (vs conservative treatment) per center. Functional disability at 6 months was assessed with the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended at 6 months, analyzed with ordinal logistic regression adjusted for prespecified confounders, quantified with a common odds ratio (OR). Variation in center preference was quantified with a median OR (MOR). Of 2697 included patients, 711 (mean [SD] age, 46.5 [19.4] years; 539 men [76%]) had an ASDH, of whom 148 (21%) underwent acute cranial surgery and 563 (79%) underwent initial conservative treatment. The acute surgery cohort had lower mean (SD) Glasgow Coma Scale scores (6.8 [4.4] vs 11.4 [4.6]), more pupil abnormalities (both pupils unreacting: 43 of 133 [32%] vs 41 of 477 [9%]), and fewer isolated ASDHs (eg, more with concurrent intracranial lesions; 92 of 133 [69%] vs 297 of 563 [53%%]) compared with the conservative treatment cohort. In the surgical cohort, 129 of 148 patients (87%) underwent decompressive craniectomy (DC), and 17 of 148 (11%) underwent craniotomy. In the conservative treatment cohort, 67 of 563 patients (12%) underwent delayed cranial surgery (DC or craniotomy). The proportion of patients undergoing acute surgery ranged from 0% to 86% (median, 17% [IQR, 5%-27%]) between centers, with up to a 3-fold higher probability of prognostically similar patients receiving acute surgery in one center compared with another random center (MOR, 2.95 [95% CI, 1.79-7.47]; P = .06). Center preference for acute surgery over initial conservative treatment was not associated with a better outcome (OR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.88-1.26] per 22% [IQR, 5%-27%] increase in acute surgery at a given trauma center). In this comparative effectiveness study, similar patients with traumatic ASDH were treated differently due to center-specific treatment preferences. Outcomes were similar in centers preferring surgical evacuation and those preferring initial conservative treatment. This study suggests that, for a patient with ASDH for whom a neurosurgeon experiences clinical equipoise between acute surgery vs (initial) conservative treatment, conservative treatment may be considered."

    "abstract": "Subdural hematoma is a rare but life-threatening complication of obstetric spinal anesthesia. We report a case of acute subdural hematoma following spinal anesthesia for elective cesarean delivery that likely promoted rebleeding from an unrecognized prepartum head trauma. A healthy 32-year-old primiparous patient (ASA II) underwent a cesarean delivery with spinal anesthesia performed with a 27-gauge Quincke needle. The perioperative course was uneventful; however thirty hours postoperatively, the patient developed a sudden severe fronto-orbital headache followed by progressive deterioration in consciousness and anisocoria. Emergency neuroimaging revealed an acute left temporal subdural hematoma with frontoparietal extension and mass effect. Further history-taking revealed a previously unreported minor head trauma one week prior to delivery. The patient underwent urgent surgical evacuation via craniectomy within one hour, resulting in rapid neurological improvement. By postoperative day three, the patient had made a full neurological recovery. This clinical presentation supports a two-hit mechanism: initial bridging-vein injury from minor trauma formed a pauci-symptomatic collection; spinal-induced cerebrospinal fluid hypotension then increased venous traction, precipitating rebleeding, amplifying mass effect. This case underscores the importance of meticulous pre-anesthetic history-taking, particularly regarding recent head trauma, in obstetric patients scheduled for neuraxial anesthesia. The use of pencil-point small-gauge spinal needles is recommended to minimize the risk of dural puncture and subsequent cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Vigilance for atypical post-dural puncture headache, prompt neuroimaging, and urgent neurosurgical intervention were key to the favorable neurological outcome observed."

    "abstract": "Managing traumatic brain injury (TBI) involves complex monitoring, especially of elevated intracranial pressure. Transcranial ultrasound (TCUS) is emerging as a useful bedside tool for assessing optic nerve sheath diameter, cerebral blood flow velocities, midline shift, ventricle size, and complications. This study compares midline shift and ventricle size measurements obtained using TCUS and non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) in patients with acute subdural hematoma (SDH) who underwent emergency decompressive craniectomy (DC). Sixty consecutive patients who underwent DC for acute SDH were enrolled. TCUS was performed before NCCT, which was done 12-24 h post-surgery. Midline shift and ventricular size (lateral and third ventricles) were assessed on both imaging modalities. Secondary parameters, including hematoma, contusion, parenchymal changes, and basal cistern patency, were also evaluated. TCUS demonstrated a strong correlation with NCCT for midline shift (r = 0.984, P < 0.001). Ventricular measurements showed good correlation - lateral ventricle (r = 0.667) and third ventricle (r = 0.914, P < 0.001). Bland-Altman analysis confirmed strong agreement. Hematoma (kappa = 1) and contusion (kappa = 0.8) showed a strong correlation. Moderate agreement was noted for parenchymal changes and basal cistern patency. TCUS was comparable to NCCT in detecting hemorrhage and parenchymal abnormalities, but less sensitive for contusion and cistern evaluation. TCUS shows excellent correlation with NCCT in evaluating midline shift and good correlation for ventricular size post-DC. It is a reliable, non-invasive bedside modality for postoperative monitoring in TBI patients."

    "abstract": "Basal cisternostomy (BC) is increasingly utilized for intracranial pressure (ICP) management in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), particularly by neurosurgeons in some high-incidence regions like India and China. It is performed as an adjunct to decompressive craniectomy (DC) or as a stand-alone procedure with bone flap replacement if brain laxity permits after basal cisternal drain placement. Emerging research from regions where this method is used supports its efficacy for ICP control. A 17-year-old male was involved in a severe road traffic accident. He presented with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 5 and bilaterally dilated, nonreactive pupils. CT revealed a left acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) with significant midline shift, severe global brain edema, effaced basal cisterns, and brainstem compression signs. Emergency BC was performed, followed by ASDH evacuation. The bone flap was replaced. Postoperatively, the patient showed remarkable recovery, with extubation on day 2 and early mobilization. By day 7, he was walking with assistance, and by discharge on day 13, he exhibited only mild word-finding difficulty, which improved significantly at follow-up. This case highlights the potential of BC as an alternative or adjunct to DC in severe TBI, emphasizing the need for larger, multicenter studies to validate its efficacy. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE25170."

    "abstract": "Acute epidural hematoma (AEDH) is a life-threatening traumatic brain injury typically managed with emergency craniotomy. Endovascular embolization of the middle meningeal artery (MMA) is effective in controlling hemorrhage and preventing epidural hematoma evacuation. In previous studies, concomitant surgical interventions have been commonly applied for other intracranial lesions. Transarterial embolization (TAE), the only definitive treatment that can completely eliminate the need for surgery in all associated intracranial pathologies, is rarely performed. Here, the authors present the case of a 24-year-old female patient with AEDH who exhibited a leakage sign on CT angiography, which was indicative of active bleeding and possible hematoma expansion. Immediate MMA embolization was performed. Hemostasis was achieved using coils, without the need for surgical interventions. The patient had favorable outcomes, including resolution of headache, absence of neurological deficits, and complete hematoma regression at 1 month. Craniotomy was not performed, and the patient had high satisfaction in terms of cosmetic outcomes. TAE can be a safe and effective primary treatment for AEDH in some patients. In particular, it can completely prevent surgery and its associated morbidities. Early endovascular intervention for leakage signs should be promptly considered to achieve rapid hemostasis and prevent hematoma expansion, even with limited surgical access. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE25521."

Brain CT-Scan was the imaging modality used to confirm the diagnosis of acute intracranial subdural hematoma in all of them, and Burr hole was done to evacuate the hematoma, and all of them fully recovered with no neurological deficit. Their postoperative follow-up visit after 2 weeks didn't document any neurologic abnormality.

    "abstract": "A 38-year-old man sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI) following a road traffic accident, presenting unconscious with vomiting and right ear bleeding. He had a prior history of head trauma with cranioplasty. On admission, he was deeply unconscious (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) E1VTM3) with unequal non-reactive pupils. Imaging revealed a significant left-sided acute subdural hematoma (SDH), burst temporal lobe, and midline shift, alongside an old cranioplasty mesh and right petrous bone fracture. Notably, there was minimal injury on the right (impact) side but extensive hemorrhagic damage on the left (opposite) side, suggesting a contrecoup injury. He underwent emergency decompressive craniotomy and postoperative ICU care, eventually recovering enough for discharge. This case highlights an unusual presentation of contrecoup injury in the absence of significant coup-related hemorrhage. The presence of a cranioplasty mesh likely influenced injury mechanics. The proposed mechanism involves both positive and negative pressure theories: the brain lagging behind skull motion (positive pressure) and rebound forces (negative pressure), creating damage on the opposite side. The mesh's rigidity compared to natural bone may have amplified injury through stress concentration at the mesh-bone interface. This unique biomechanical interaction may explain the disproportionate injury seen contralaterally. To our knowledge, no previous case reports describe such an isolated contrecoup injury pattern associated with a cranioplasty mesh. This report underscores the importance of considering altered skull biomechanics in patients with prior cranial surgeries and contributes novel insight into TBI dynamics."

This report presents a rare case of an infant who developed both conditions concurrently, resulting in fatality. A female infant, aged 4 months and 25 days, presented to the emergency department with persistent vomiting for 15 hours and loss of consciousness for 5 hours. Computed tomography of the head indicated a substantial epidural hematoma involving the left frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. The patient was promptly admitted to the intensive care unit for resuscitative measures and surgical preparation. Emergency decompressive surgery was performed, and postoperative supportive management, including fluid resuscitation and antimicrobial therapy, was initiated. Postoperatively, the infant demonstrated clinical improvement sufficient for ventilator weaning. However, cardiac arrest occurred within one minute of extubation. Despite immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the patient did not survive. The concurrence of acute epidural hematoma and breath-holding spells is a rare and potentially fatal clinical entity in infants. Mortality related to BHS remains uncommon. Early recognition, comprehensive parental education, prompt multidisciplinary intervention, and heightened clinical awareness are essential for improving prognoses in pediatric patients presenting with craniocerebral trauma complicated by BHS."

    "abstract": "The authors report a case of fatal postpartum acute subdural hematoma after multiple attempts at spinal anesthesia related to cesarean delivery. A 22-year-old primigravida was admitted to the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department due to the throes of childbirth. The presence of threatening intrauterine hypoxia indicated a C-section with the usual lumbar anesthesia. However, the anesthesia proved insufficient, necessitating the administration of intratracheal narcosis, which occurred without complication. A healthy, mature boy was born with Apgar scores of 10/1 and 10/5. During the first 8 h of the postpartum period, the primipara exhibited stable vital parameters without neurological symptoms. After 8.5 h, a grand mal seizure was observed following a period of consciousness and spontaneous breathing that soon ceased. The CT scan examination revealed a significant left fronto-temporo-parietal acute subdural hematoma. All brainstem reflexes were absent, lacking corneal, trigemino-facial, and oculo-vestibular reflexes, with submaximal dilated pupils, and unresponsive to direct and consensual light stimuli. Despite an urgent neurosurgery operation and 4 days of intensive therapy, follow-up brain CT examinations showed a massive midline shift and compression of the supratentorial ventricle system. No trauma or other malformations of the brain were detected. According to the primary brain damage protocol, after a 12-hour observation period, brain death was declared, and she was deemed suitable for organ donation. Our mini-review identified 12 published cases of postpartum subdural hematoma following spinal anesthesia between 1995 and 2021. The data highlight the importance of early neuroimaging and multidisciplinary assessment when postpartum headaches or seizures occur."

    "abstract": "Hematoma expansion in acute epidural hematomas occurred in 11.2%-32% of patients treated conservatively at initial presentation and required craniotomy. Middle meningeal artery (MMA) embolization has been reported to be effective in preventing hematoma expansion. We report a case of an asymptomatic acute epidural hematoma in which CTA was used to identify the source of bleeding. Embolization of the MMA was performed to prevent hematoma expansion. A 30-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency department following a collision with a car while riding his motorcycle. The patient exhibited clear consciousness and no neurological deficits. A head CT scan revealed a right parietal and temporal bone fracture, and an acute epidural hematoma directly below the fracture site. The hematoma was small, and the patient was treated conservatively. Three hours later, a follow-up head CT scan revealed an enlarged hematoma. This hematoma was found near the transverse sinus. To identify the source of the bleeding, a CTA was performed, which revealed extravasation into the hematoma from an area distant from the transverse sinus. We performed embolization of the MMA. The postoperative course was good with no postoperative hematoma expansion. CTA for acute epidural hematoma without neurological symptoms is a useful diagnostic tool that can identify patients at high risk for hematoma expansion. If the findings indicate the need for intervention, MMA embolization is a treatment option that may reduce the risk of hematoma expansion and craniotomy."

    "abstract": "Labbé vein thrombosis is a rare cause of cerebral venous thrombosis that may mimic more common intracranial hemorrhagic pathologies, such as acute subdural hematoma or cortical hemorrhage, on initial CT. This case involves a 20-year-old male who presented with an acute right temporal headache and a hyperdense subcortical lesion on CT. The thrombus measured approximately 65 HU. MRI revealed a T1 hyperintense thrombus in the vein of Labbé, and digital subtraction angiography confirmed venous occlusion. The patient was treated with anticoagulation and recovered without neurological deficit. This case highlights a diagnostic pitfall in emergency neuroimaging and emphasizes the value of multimodal imaging for accurate diagnosis."

    "title": "Emergency Cranial Neurosurgery: An Audit of Operative Burden in a Specialized Neurosurgical Center in a Resource-Limited Setting.",
    "abstract": "Background Neurosurgical emergencies pose significant challenges not only to healthcare systems but also to society and the economy. This audit examines the burden of emergency cranial neurosurgery procedures at a specialized center, highlighting the volume of cases and underscoring the need for additional dedicated neurosurgical facilities to meet the growing demand. Objective To assess the burden of emergency cranial neurosurgery procedures at the Punjab Institute of Neurosciences (PINS) in Lahore, Pakistan. Methodology This retrospective observational audit was conducted at the PINS, Lahore, analyzing data from patients who underwent emergency cranial neurosurgery over six months. A consecutive sampling technique was used, including all eligible patients while excluding those with incomplete records or non-cranial procedures. Data were collected from various hospital records and cross-verified for accuracy. Patients who underwent multiple procedures in a single surgery were recorded as a single entry. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 27.0 (Released 2020; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results A total of 562 patients, aged 7-90 years, with a mean age of 38.18 ± 18.42 years, underwent emergency cranial neurosurgery. Males accounted for 415 cases (73.84%), resulting in a female-to-male ratio of approximately 1:2.82. Traumatic cases comprised 241 patients (42.88%), with extradural hematoma diagnosed in 110 patients (34.27% of traumatic cases; 19.57% of total cases), acute subdural hematoma in 94 patients (29.28% of traumatic cases; 16.73% of total cases), and hemorrhagic contusion in 34 patients (10.59% of traumatic cases; 6.05% of total cases). Nontraumatic cases accounted for 321 patients (57.12%), with non-tumor hydrocephalus observed in 70 patients (29.05% of nontraumatic cases; 12.46% of total cases), intracerebral hematoma in 37 patients (15.35% of nontraumatic cases; 6.58% of total cases), and shunt malfunction in 23 patients (9.54% of nontraumatic cases; 4.09% of total cases). The most common surgical interventions performed were craniotomy for extradural hematoma in 106 patients (18.86%), ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement in 79 patients (14.06%), and tracheostomy in 54 patients (9.61%). Conclusions This audit highlights trauma and hydrocephalus as the leading causes of emergency cranial neurosurgical procedures. In developing countries like Pakistan, specialized neurosurgical centers, particularly their emergency departments and operating theaters, face a substantial patient load, emphasizing the urgent need for expanded facilities and resources."

    "abstract": "A male patient in his 50s had a head-on collision while driving. Prehospital emergency services recorded pulseless electrical activity on an electrocardiogram, and chest compressions were initiated. Before hospital arrival, return of spontaneous circulation was achieved after 17-min resuscitation during transport. His Glasgow Coma Scale score was 6, with unequal-size pupils unresponsive to light stimuli. A head computed tomography scan revealed a left acute subdural hematoma with a marked midline shift, and computed tomography of the cervical spine showed that the atlanto-occipital and atlanto-axial joint spaces were significantly widened. Initially, an emergency decompressive craniectomy for hematoma evacuation was performed, followed by posterior cervical fixation surgery in the subacute phase. After brain surgery, neurocritical care management was implemented for brain protection. Cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple ligament injuries at the craniovertebral junction, which confirmed the diagnosis of atlanto-occipital and atlanto-axial dislocation. On day 9, posterior fixation from the occiput to the fourth cervical vertebrae was performed. Subsequently, he was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital on day 45. No neurological sequelae were noted except for the neck rotation limitations due to the fixation surgery, and he could return to his previous job. Although craniovertebral junction ligamentous injuries are rare, they may coexist with severe traumatic brain injury. A careful reading of preoperative images focusing on the inter-joint space is important to detect craniovertebral junction ligamentous injuries in patients with traumatic brain injury inflicted with high-energy trauma."

    "title": "Middle Meningeal Artery Embolization for Acute Epidural Hematomas: A Promising Alternative to Traditional Surgery.",
    "abstract": "Acute epidural hematoma (AEDH) is recognized as one of the most urgent neurosurgical conditions. Traditionally, the primary treatment for AEDH has involved craniotomy with surgical evacuation of the hematoma. However, with the widespread adoption of neurointerventional techniques, interest in their application to various forms of traumatic brain injuries has increased. Among these, embolization of the middle meningeal artery (MMA) has emerged as a minimally invasive treatment option for AEDH. This study evaluates the effectiveness of MMA embolization as a primary treatment for AEDH.We conducted a retrospective review of patients treated for AEDH with embolization of the MMA at our institution from January 2019 to July 2024. Patient demographics, clinical presentation, procedural details, and outcomes were analyzed.MMA embolization was successfully performed in 20 patients with AEDH, with only 2 cases requiring subsequent burr-hole evacuation. The thickness of the AEDH was 10 mm or more in 47.8% of cases, and a midline shift was observed in 65.2% of cases. The most common angiographic findings included arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and contrast extravasation. N-butyl cyanoacrylate was used as the embolic material in all cases. In one case, Squid 12 was added to enhance penetration at sites of extravasation. No patients experienced recurrent AEDH postintervention.MMA embolization is a promising minimally invasive treatment for AEDH, showing effectiveness as both a primary and adjuvant therapy. Future prospective multicenter studies are needed to validate preliminary findings and optimize treatment protocols for this high-risk patient population."

    "title": "Exploring conservative avenues in subacute subdural hematoma: the potential role of atorvastatin and dexamethasone as lifesaving allies.",
    "abstract": "Most cases of acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) require emergency surgery; only a few patients can survive without surgery in the early stages and then develop into subacute subdural hematoma (sASDH). However, the optimal conservative treatment has not yet been established for these sASDH patients. Based on our previous studies, atorvastatin plus dexamethasone may be safe and effective for them. This article aims to document such cases and analyze the possible mechanisms. We selected five patients with sASDH who received a treatment regimen of atorvastatin plus low-dose dexamethasone without surgery. We then observed the clinical and radiological features during treatment and follow-up. The PubMed database and Google Scholar were retrieved for literature regarding the efficacy and safety of conservative treatment in patients with ASDH/sASDH. We extracted information including authors, sample size, gender, number of patients (death, poor prognosis, delayed surgery), and risk factors. Of the five patients, all patients who refused surgery for various reasons were resolved after treatment with atorvastatin plus low-dose dexamethasone for their conditions. No hematomas recurred or progressed during an at least 6-month follow-up. We identified 6 studies after searching the database; a total of 1374 patients (F:M = 3:7) with ASDH/sASDH received initial conservative treatment. The pooled results showed that 13.1% of patients who initially received conservative treatment deteriorated and required delayed surgical treatment. Of 1374, the overall incidence of poor prognosis was 19.2%, and 7% of patients eventually died. It is essential to establish an optimal conservative treatment for patients with sASDH who cannot undergo surgery in an emergency for various reasons. Atorvastatin plus dexamethasone may be an alternative treatment in such a subgroup of sASDH, although a randomized proof-of-concept clinical trial is needed."

    "abstract": "An acute epidural hematoma (AEDH) is a severe complication of traumatic brain injury, occurring in 1%-3% of all head trauma cases. Herein, the authors report a rare case of AEDH in a 51-year-old male, with the AEDH extending bilaterally across the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and into the infratentorial region following a fall. The patient underwent an emergency craniotomy and hematoma evacuation, and favorable outcomes were achieved. This case highlights the importance of utilizing surgical and skin incision positions that allow for adequate removal of AEDH and show the effectiveness of prompt surgical intervention. Bleeding from the venous sinus is common in epidural hematomas that extend above and below the dural tentorium and to both sides of the SSS. To ensure adequate hemostasis, the bony flap near the venous sinus should be preserved to achieve hemostasis. Excessive compression of the venous sinus should be avoided to prevent obstruction. If time permits, the morphology of the dural sinus should be confirmed through CT venography or MR venography. After craniotomy, the patient should be positioned to avoid air embolization from the site of venous sinus injury. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE24756."

    "abstract": "Brainstem hemorrhage can occur as a primary or secondary event in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Duret hemorrhage is a type of brainstem hemorrhage caused by a secondary increase in intracranial pressure and transtentorial herniation. Duret hemorrhage following TBI has been considered an irreversible and terminal event. We report a young adult patient with bifrontal extradural hematoma who presented with a low Glasgow Coma Scale score and advanced signs of cerebral herniation. The patient underwent an urgent craniotomy for evacuation of an acute epidural hematoma and remained in a poor neurological state post-surgery. A postoperative scan was done within 24 hours, which showed a newly developed Duret hemorrhage. The patient was nursed postoperatively with aggressive neurocritical and neurorehabilitation maneuvers; however, continued to have a poor neurological score. Although Duret hemorrhage has been reported in neurosurgical literature owing to various other etiologies, interestingly only four cases till now have been reported post craniotomy for extradural hematoma evacuation. Duret hemorrhage in the setting of cerebral herniation after a severe TBI has been considered a terminal brainstem event with a high incidence of death or persistent vegetative outcome."

    "abstract": "Acute traumatic subdural hematomas (aTSDH) represent a frequent and critical neurosurgical emergency, associated with a significant risk of mortality. Elderly patients with symptomatic aTSDH may benefit from early antifibrinolytic therapy (EAFT). We aim to investigate whether EAFT can improve clinical outcomes in aTSDH patients and to explore the factors influencing mortality, using data from a nationwide, multicenter, prospective cohort study. Multicenter, prospective cohort study at 30 trauma centers from 2023 to 2024 enrolled 963 patients diagnosed aTSDH. After screening, 297 patients aged 60 years or older met inclusion criteria. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included vascular occlusion, brain rebleeding, sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and renal failure. A total of 297 aTSDH patients were identified, of whom 195 received EAFT, and 102 were in the control group. After propensity score matching (PSM), 80 patients in each group were compared. There were no significant differences in 90-day mortality (before PSM, P = 0.439; after PSM, P = 0.828). The difference between the two group in the incidence of brain rebleeding, sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and renal failure were similar before and after PSM. The EAFT group had a significantly higher incidence of vascular occlusion compared to the control group (before PSM, P = 0.014; after PSM, P = 0.027). In multivariate logistic regression (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]), increased 90-day mortality was predicted by larger hematoma volume (2.329 [1.123-4.830], P = 0.023) and greater midline shift (2.251 [1.065-4.755], P = 0.034). Sensitivity analysis indicated that there was heterogeneity in the treatment effects between the two groups across different midline shift categories (before PSM, P = 0.012; after PSM, P = 0.043). EAFT may not significantly reduce mortality in elderly aTSDH patients and could potentially increase the risk of vascular occlusion. Therefore, its use in this population should be approached with caution, carefully assessing the potential risks."

    "abstract": "The Kernohan-Woltman phenomenon, a rare and often misunderstood neurological condition, is recognized as a false localizing neurological sign. This phenomenon is characterized by a motor deficit ipsilateral to the site of the neurological lesion and occurs due to the mass effect of supratentorial lesions causing a shift of midline structures and subsequent transtentorial herniation, leading to compression of the contralateral corticospinal (pyramidal) fibers within the cerebellum, ipsilateral to the lesion. This case describes a patient with human immunodeficiency virus-1 and chronic kidney disease who presented to the emergency department with uremic syndrome and a hypertensive crisis. She experienced sudden neurological deterioration, manifesting as prostration, anisocoria, and left hemiparesis, in the context of an acute subdural hematoma of the left cerebral hemisphere, which is a rare complication of hypertensive crisis. The fact that the hemiparesis was on the same side as the hematoma indicates a rare neurological sign, known as the Kernohan-Woltman phenomenon. This case is particularly noteworthy due to the rare coexistence of these conditions and the atypical presentation of neurological symptoms in the context of supratentorial lesions. The case emphasizes the importance of recognizing this phenomenon in patients with mass-effect lesions, especially in the setting of critical illness, as early identification can influence clinical decision-making and management strategies. Given the rarity of this phenomenon, this report contributes to the literature by providing insight into its clinical presentation and diagnostic challenges, highlighting its relevance in neurocritical care."

    "abstract": "Acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) is a type of intracranial hemorrhage and is due to the collection of blood below the inner layer of the dura but external to the brain and arachnoid membrane. It tends to occur in the temporal parietal regions. Early intervention is the key for better outcome of the patient. Management depends on neurological status and imaging. Large SDH collects along the convexity of the brain causing compression over the brain stem with midline shift. In cases of conservatively managed ASDH, spontaneous resolution usually takes weeks to months depending on the size of the bleed. In rare cases, spontaneous rapid resolution of the SDH occurs. So here, we are presenting an 11-month-old baby girl who was brought to our Emergency room/department (ER) with a history of fall and computed tomography scan was suggestion of an ASDH in the left temporoparietal region which resolves on its own in 6 h which is a rare phenomenon and needs to be highlighted."

    "abstract": "Acute subdural hematoma is a critical condition, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Despite advancements in surgical techniques, a portion of patients only show limited clinical improvement post-evacuation. Surgical intervention decisions are critically important, as they can either improve or worsen a patient's condition. Radiomics offers significant potential by extracting complex patterns from digital medical images and transforming them into high-dimensional data that reflect the underlying pathophysiology. By integrating Radiomics with individual patient characteristics, we can develop decision support models. This study aims to analyze radiomic parameters of aSDH to determine whether they support the decision to proceed with urgent surgery or opt for a conservative approach. We hypothesized that surface area could be a significant predictor of neurological outcome such as maintaining independent mobility (mRS ≥ 3) and survival rates. This retrospective study involved radiomic analysis according to neurological outcome and survival. Radiomic parameters were measured using 3D Slicer software. Statistical analyses explored correlations, employing AUC-analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival. Our findings revealed significant correlations between hematoma and surface area with poorer neurological prognosis. Further subgroup analysis showed surface area as a significant predictor for poorer outcomes in patients undergoing craniotomy (p = 0.006 in univariant- and p = 0.020 in multivariant analysis). In the total cohort, among conservatively managed and craniotomy subgroups, survival analysis highlighted an advantageous survival for patients exhibiting smaller surface areas (< 339.50 cm2). Especially in craniotomy patients, surface area emerged as a possible predictor for neurological outcome and survival."

    "abstract": "Propofol is one of the most used intravenous anesthetic agents in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients undergoing emergency neurosurgical procedures. Despite being efficacious, its administration is associated with dose-related adverse effects. The use of adjuvants along with propofol aids in limiting its consumption, thereby mitigating the side effects related to propofol usage. This study aims to compare the safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine-propofol versus fentanyl-propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) in adult TBI patients. A hundred patients posted for emergency evacuation of acute subdural hematoma were enrolled, and they were randomized into two groups of 50 each. Propofol-based TIVA with a Schneider target-controlled infusion model was used for induction and maintenance. Patients in Group F received fentanyl, and those in Group D received dexmedetomidine infusions as adjuvants. Advanced hemodynamic parameters were monitored. Intracranial pressure (ICP) and brain relaxation were measured after dural opening. The mean propofol consumption, number of additional fentanyl boluses, and blood samples for S100b (a biomarker of neuronal injury) were also collected. The mean propofol consumption in Group D (88.7 ± 31.8 μg/kg/min) was lower when compared to Group F (107.9 ± 34.6 μg/kg/min), (P = 0.005). The mean intraoperative fentanyl requirement and postoperative S100b were significantly reduced in Group D. Subdural ICPs and brain relaxation scores were comparable. Hemodynamic parameters were well maintained in both groups. In TBI, dexmedetomidine as an adjunct to propofol-based TIVA results in a greater reduction in total propofol consumption and intraoperative opioid requirements while maintaining hemodynamic stability when compared to fentanyl."

    "abstract": "Acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) is a critical and often fatal condition, particularly in elderly patients receiving anticoagulant therapy. With a growing global aging population, the incidence of traumatic brain injuries, including ASDH, is projected to rise, presenting significant challenges in clinical management. This study evaluates the outcomes of surgically treated ASDH in patients aged 65 years and older, comparing those who received anticoagulant therapy with those who did not. It also aims to identify the main risk factors for poor outcomes and explore preventive strategies in this vulnerable population. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 90 patients aged 65 years and older who underwent surgery for ASDH at our institution between 2018 and 2023. Patients were categorized into two groups based on anticoagulant therapy use. Demographic data, mechanisms of injury, clinical presentations, and outcomes, including mortality and reoperation rates, were analyzed. Radiological assessments included hematoma thickness, midline shift, and the presence of residual hematoma. No significant differences were observed in hematoma thickness, midline shift, or mortality between patients receiving anticoagulant therapy and those not on anticoagulants. However, a significant association was found between anticoagulant use and the mechanism of injury; patients on anticoagulants were more likely to sustain ASDH from low-energy trauma, such as a fall from the same level (p=0.005). Despite the high mortality rates associated with ASDH in elderly patients, the multidisciplinary approach employed, including the prompt reversal of coagulopathy, likely contributed to the observed outcomes. Acute subdural hematoma in elderly patients, particularly those receiving anticoagulant therapy, remains a challenging problem with a high rate of poor outcomes. This study highlights the urgent need for preventive measures to mitigate the risks associated with even minor trauma, especially in patients on anticoagulants. Our findings underscore the importance of appropriate management protocols, including the timely reversal of coagulopathy, in improving survival rates within this high-risk population. Further research is needed to develop and validate comprehensive preventive strategies and to investigate long-term outcomes in these patients."

    "abstract": "Acute epidural hematoma is one of the most serious traumatic conditions in neurosurgery, for which emergency surgery may be indicated. Injury to the middle meningeal artery (MMA) is generally the cause of hemorrhage, often accompanied by convexity fractures resulting from head trauma. However, an epidural hematoma by a contusion of the jaw is very rare. A 27-year-old male fell after drinking alcohol and was brought to our hospital. The patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 6 (E1V1M4), and the right pupil was 5 mm with no response to light. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head showed an acute epidural hematoma in the right middle skull base to the temporal region and no fracture lines of the vault of the skull. An emergency right frontotemporal craniotomy was performed to remove the hematoma. A postoperative recheck of the preoperative images revealed a right mandibular fossa fracture. The postoperative course was uneventful, with clear consciousness and resolution of motor paralysis the day after surgery. On the 11th postoperative day, the patient could walk independently and was discharged. As there was no injury to the MMA in the convexity area, which is generally the cause of acute epidural hematoma, damage to a branch of the MMA resulting from a mandibular fossa fracture was considered a possible mechanism for developing acute epidural hematoma. A case of mandibular fossa fracture resulting in acute epidural hematoma is extremely rare, and the etiology remains unknown, so we reported here with a review of the literature."

    "abstract": "Pure acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) is an uncommon clinical presentation of ruptured intracranial aneurysms, and only rarely, the culprit is a cortical microaneurysm.Mortality can be high; thus, appropriate diagnosis and treatment are crucial. Due to its extreme rarity, there are no available guidelines.We aimed to describe two clinical cases of pure ASDH due to cortical microaneurysm rupture, and a literature review was performed. A 33-year-old man, with no history of head trauma, was admitted with headache and left hemiparesis. Computed tomography (CT) showed right convexity ASDH, and CT angiography excluded intracranial vascular malformations. An emergent craniotomy was performed, and a microaneurysm was identified; the lesion was electrocoagulated and wrapped in muslin. The patient was discharged three weeks after with a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 1. A 58-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency room (ER) with a presumed history of head trauma. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 4, and the left pupil was mydriatic. A CT scan showed a left convexity ASDH. Emergent decompressive craniotomy was performed, and the cortical surface beneath the hematoma revealed a microaneurysm that was clipped. The neurological status improved, but she perished 14 days after the procedure for nosocomial pneumoniae. To date, few cases of pure ASDH due to cortical non-mycotic microaneurysm rupture were reported, including the two described in this article. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) continues to be the gold standard for diagnosis. Nevertheless, the possibility of angiographically unvisualized lesions should be considered. The risk of rebleeding is high, and it foresees a worse outcome. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are imperative to achieve better outcomes, and the craniotomy must be extensive to expose a large area of the brain surface beneath the hematoma to assess a possible bleeding source. After treatment, the outcome is good in most published cases. In patients presenting with nontraumatic ASDH, after the imageological exclusion of vascular intracranial malformations, the craniotomy for hematoma evacuation should be large to visualize all the brain surface beneath the hematoma to identify possible microaneurysm as the source of bleeding. To improve the outcome, the microaneurysm should be treated to prevent rebleeding."

Materials and Methods  A retrospective review was conducted on patients who underwent emergency neurological procedures according to the head injury fast-track system. Data from April 2018 to April 2020 (pre-COVID) were compared with data from May 2020 to May 2022 (during COVID). Results  The analysis comprised 128 patients in the prepandemic group and 119 patients in the pandemic group, with 5 patients diagnosed with COVID infection during the pandemic. Acute subdural hematoma resulting from motorcycle accidents was the most common diagnosis in both groups (56.3 and 47.5%, respectively). The initial Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score was significantly lower during the pandemic compared to the prepandemic period ( p  = 0.025). Time metrics in the emergency department, including door to computed tomography (CT), emergency room (ER) exit, and incision times, were significantly longer in the pandemic group ( p  < 0.05). However, there were no statistically significant differences in in-hospital mortality rates (25.8 and 17.7%, respectively; p  = 0.12) or the percentage of patients with a favorable functional outcome (Glasgow outcome scale ≥4). At 1 month, a favorable functional outcome was observed in 51.6% of prepandemic patients and 57.1% of pandemic patients ( p  = 0.69), while at 6 months, the percentages were 56.8 and 64.5%, respectively ( p  = 0.23). Conclusions  Our study revealed significant delays in hospital processes for head injuries during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we found no significant impact on mortality rates or functional outcomes of patients."

    "abstract": "Traumatic middle meningeal artery aneurysm (TMMA) is a rare condition and a known cause of several different bleeding patterns after head injury. Once detected, they need to be treated as an emergency due to their potential for morbidity and mortality. Generally, recurrence does not occur in surgery for acute epidural hematoma if adequate hemostasis is achieved. Here, we report a case of atypical postoperative recurrence of an acute epidural hematoma, possibly due to the development and rupture of a TMMA. A 41-year-old man with left acute epidural hematoma after a head injury was referred to our hospital. Emergency craniotomy was performed immediately, and the hematoma was removed. The source of the bleeding was near the fracture site in the middle cranial fossa, and sufficient hemostasis was confirmed. However, a head computed tomography (CT) scan the next day revealed a recurrence of the acute epidural hematoma. Magnetic resonance (MR) angiogram showed an aneurysm with a diameter of approximately 4 mm in the left middle meningeal artery. The recurrence of the acute epidural hematoma appeared to be related to the formation and a rupture of a middle meningeal artery aneurysm, and to prevent subsequent rebleeding, the patient underwent reoperation, and the hematoma and aneurysm were removed. In surgery for acute epidural hematoma, recurrence can be prevented by removing the hematoma and ensuring hemostasis. Although conventional surgery was performed in this case, a repeat of epidural hematoma occurred. A postoperative middle meningeal artery aneurysm had been thought to have developed, ruptured, and caused a repeat epidural hematoma. In treating acute epidural hematoma, a TMMA development should be considered when an atypical clinical course occurs, such as a recurrence of postoperative bleeding."

It is characterized by the accumulation of blood between the dura mater and occipital bone, leading to compression of the brainstem. We report the case of a 25-year-old male who presented to the emergency department following a fall, exhibiting confusion and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 14. Imaging revealed a significant acute epidural hematoma with associated mass effect, frontal hemorrhagic contusion, and right transverse sinus rupture. The initial hematoma volume was calculated to be 44.41 cm3 using the ellipsoid formula. Prompt neurosurgical intervention was performed, including craniotomy for hematoma evacuation and suction tube placement. Despite a decline in GCS score postoperatively, subsequent surgical management led to hematoma resolution and neurological improvement. The hematoma volume had decreased to 33.19 cm3 after the second intervention. After 15 days, the patient achieved a GCS score of 15. Our case highlights the importance of early recognition, emergent surgical intervention, and standardized management protocols for the treatment of PFEDH. In addition, it emphasizes the value of quantitative hematoma measurements in guiding treatment decisions. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial to alleviate the potentially fatal consequences of this rare neurological condition."

    "title": "Dantrolene for Control of Refractory Shivering in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: A Case Study.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Hyperthermia is strongly associated with a worse neurological outcome in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and can be exacerbated by shivering. However, effective treatments for uncontrolled shivering have yet to be established. We successfully treated a patient with severe TBI and repeated episodes of shivering using dantrolene sodium hydrate (dantrolene). CASE REPORT A 28-year-old healthy male sustained an acute subdural hematoma with a midline shift following a traffic accident. He underwent emergency evacuation of the hematoma and craniectomy and was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. The patient experienced severe shivering on the first day of hospitalization. Neuroprotective drugs were administered, and targeted temperature management at normothermia was initiated, initially controlling the shivering. On day 9 of hospitalization, shivering recurred, with a high fever. Despite the reintroduction of general anesthesia and targeted temperature management, the shivering was intractable. We administered dantrolene, which successfully eliminated the shivering. After the intervention, the patient's body temperature and intracranial pressure were well managed. The patient was subsequently transferred to a rehabilitation hospital, with a favorable neurological outcome 70 days after the injury. CONCLUSIONS This case report demonstrates that dantrolene is an effective option for managing uncontrollable shivering in the context of intracranial pressure control after severe brain injury. This finding suggests the potential for the broader use of dantrolene in similar clinical scenarios and supports further investigation of its efficacy and mechanisms of action in TBI care."

    "title": "Surgical Management of Acute Subdural Hematoma: A Meta-Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Traumatic acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) is a medical emergency that requires prompt neurosurgical intervention. Urgent surgical evacuation may be performed with craniotomy (CO) and decompressive craniectomy (DC). However, a meta-analysis evaluating confounders, pooled functional outcomes, and mortality analyses at different time points has not been performed. A systematic search was conducted until August 28, 2023. We identified studies performing ASDH evacuation with CO or DC. Outcomes included Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), GOS-Extended, mortality, procedure-related complications, and reoperation. Variables were assessed using risk ratio (RR) and mean difference. Among 684 published articles, we included the Randomized Evaluation of Surgery with Craniectomy for Patients Undergoing Evacuation of ASDH (RESCUE-ASDH) trial, 4 propensity score-matched (PSM) cohorts, and 13 observational cohort studies. A total of 8886 patients underwent CO or DC. GCS at admission in unmatched cohorts was significantly worse in the DC group (mean difference = 2.20 [95% CI = 1.86-2.55], P < .00001). GOS-Extended scores were similar among CO and DC (RR = 1.10 [95% CI = 0.85-1.42], P = .49), including the RESCUE-ASDH trial. GOS at the last follow-up in unmatched cohorts significantly favored CO (RR = 1.66 [95% CI = 1.02-2.70], P = .04). Similarly, while short-term mortality favored CO over DC (RR = 0.69 [95% CI = 0.51-0.93], P = .02), both the RESCUE-ASDH trial and the PSM-cohorts yielded similar mortality rates among groups (P > .05). Mortality at the last follow-up in unmatched patients favored CO (RR = 0.60 [95% CI = 0.47-0.77], P < .0001). Procedure-related complications (RR = 0.74 [0.50-1.09], P = .12) and reoperation rates (RR = 0.74 [0.50-1.09], P = .12) were similar. Patients with ASDH undergoing DC across unmatched cohorts had a worse GCS at admission. Although ASDH mortality was lower in the CO group, these findings are derived from unmatched cohorts, potentially confounding previous analyses. Notably, population-matched studies, such as the RESCUE-ASDH trial and PSM cohorts, showed similar effectiveness in mortality and functional outcomes between CO and DC. Reoperation and complication rates were comparable among surgical approaches. Considering the prevalence of unmatched cohorts, our findings highlight the need of future clinical trials to validate the findings of the RESCUE-ASDH trial."

    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Pediatric traumatic brain injury (pTBI) remains a major pediatric public health problem, despite well-developed injury prevention programs. The purpose of this study is to analyze the emergency surgical outcomes of pTBI in a single institute ten-year retrospective study to offer a real-world clinical result. Materials and Methods: Our institute presented a clinical retrospective, single-institute research study of 150 pediatric TBI cases that were diagnosed and underwent emergency surgical treatment from 2010 to 2019. Results: The incidence of radiological findings is detailed as follows: brain edema (30%, 45/150), followed by acute subdural hematoma (27.3%, 41/150), epidural hematoma (21.3%, 32/150), chronic subdural hemorrhage (10%, 15/150), skull fracture (6.7%, 10/150), and traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (4.7%, 7/150). Surgical intervention data revealed that decompressive craniectomy was still the main effective surgical method. The results showed longer hospital stays and higher morbidity rates in the brain edema, acute subdural hematoma, and chronic subdural hemorrhage groups, which were viewed as poor surgical outcome groups. Epidural hematoma, skull fracture and traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage were categorized into good surgical outcome groups. Notably, the data revealed gross improvement in Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS) evolution after surgical interventions, and the time to cranioplasty was a significant factor in the development of post-traumatic hydrocephalus (PTH). Conclusions: Our study provided real-world data for the distribution of etiology in pTBI and also categorized it into six groups, indicating disease-orientated treatment. In addition, our data supported that decompressive craniectomy (DC) remains a mainstay surgical treatment in pTBI and early cranioplasty could decrease the incidence of PTH."

    "title": "Characteristics of a Pure Acute Subdural Hematoma Caused by Intracranial Aneurysm Rupture: A Case Report and Review of Literature.",
    "abstract": "Pure acute subdural hematomas (ASDHs) due to ruptured aneurysms without subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage are rare. We report the case of a 26-year-old female who presented with a pure ASDH caused by a ruptured distal anterior cerebral artery (ACA). The patient complained of sudden headache and vomiting and was transferred to our hospital. On the ambulance journey to the hospital, her consciousness level decreased suddenly just after experiencing additional pain in the head. At admission, the consciousness level was 4 points on the Glasgow coma scale with bilateral pupil dilatation. Computed tomography (CT) and CT angiography showed a left ASDH without subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and a distal ACA aneurysm. Emergent hematoma evacuation was performed, but SAH and the bleeding point were not observed. Therefore, coil embolization for the distal ACA aneurysm was performed after an emergent operation. During embolization, intraoperative rupture was observed. The contrast media was seen up to the convexity subdural space along the falx. Extravasation ceased after intraaneurysmal coil embolization. Consequently, the rupture of the distal ACA aneurysm was diagnosed as the cause of the pure ASDH. The patient received additional coil embolization due to recanalization of the aneurysm without rebleeding 44 days after admission and was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital 55 days after admission to our hospital with a score of 4 on the modified ranking scale. From the reviews of 56 patients from 32 studies, including our case, we determine that an ACA aneurysm could show the distant hematomas located far from the site of a ruptured aneurysm compared with a ruptured aneurysm located in the internal carotid and middle cerebral arteries. Distant hematoma location could also lead to delayed diagnosis of aneurysms and lead to rebleeding and poor outcomes. Aneurysm rupture diagnoses should receive special attention, especially for ACA aneurysms, as the hematoma may be located far from the rupture site."

    "abstract": "Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) ranks among the most prevalent neurosurgical conditions, with burr-hole drainage typically yielding favorable prognoses. Nevertheless, perioperative complications may arise, with remote intraparenchymal hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage occurring infrequently, while acute subdural hematoma (aSDH) remains a relatively common complication post-cSDH removal. The standard treatment for aSDH, typically large craniotomy, substantially elevates surgical risk. Patients admitted over the course of 51 months (February 2022 to May 2024) to a single institution for treatment of cSDH were retrospectively evaluated, with three cases of postoperative aSDH in elderly patients with cSDH, examining potential causative factors and proposing pertinent strategies. Three elderly patients, admitted urgently due to exacerbating symptoms, underwent preoperative assessment followed by emergency parietal burr-hole drainage. Regrettably, all three patients developed aSDH postoperatively. Various treatment approaches were employed: two cases received thrombolysis with 50,000 units of urokinase, while one case required a large craniotomy. Despite the patients achieving satisfactory outcomes without significant neurological deficits, this study advocates thrombolytic therapy as a potentially superior option for aSDH following cSDH surgery. Urokinase-mediated subdural thrombolysis enhances hematoma clearance rates, suggesting a shift toward minimally invasive treatments to mitigate greater trauma. However, the paucity of evidence necessitates extensive research to validate its safety and efficacy."

    "title": "Delayed Burr Hole Evacuation Compared With Acute Craniotomy for Acute Subdural Hematoma in Older Patients With Low-Energy Trauma.",
    "abstract": "Background Acute subdural hematomas commonly require emergent surgical decompression by craniotomy. There is currently limited research on alternative surgical strategies in the elderly population. This study investigates delayed surgical intervention for stable patients with low-energy trauma presenting with acute subdural hematomas. Methodology In this retrospective chart review, 45 patients over the age of 55 presenting with acute subdural hematomas with a Glasgow Coma Scale score greater than or equal to 13 in the setting of low-energy trauma were selected. Additionally, included patients had a maximal hematoma thickness of >10 mm and/or a midline shift size of >5 mm per the current Brain Trauma Foundations guidelines for surgical intervention of subdural hematomas. The study was performed at a large tertiary care center, with records being examined from 1995 to 2020. Comparison groups were immediate craniotomy (within 24 hours) or delayed burr hole (minimum of 48 hours passing since the initial presentation). Primary outcomes included minor complications, major complications, any complications, and any complications with mortality excluded. There was no significant difference in mortality between the two cohorts. Results The immediate craniotomy group consisted of 16 patients, while the delayed burr hole group consisted of 29 patients. The results demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the incidence of any complication including mortality (relative risk (RR) = 3.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.71-5.88, p < 0.0001), major complications (RR = 2.33, 95% CI = 1.07-5.07, p = 0.031), and minor complications (RR = 2.42, 95% CI = 1.02-5.74, p = 0.041) in the immediate craniotomy group compared to the delayed burr hole group. Conclusions Our study demonstrates the decreased risk of major and minor complications for delayed burr hole evacuation in stable patients >55 years old presenting with low-energy trauma and subdural hematoma. The results suggest that for this population of patients, it appears to be beneficial to delay surgery if the patient's clinical situation allows."

Here, we present the occurrence of HSVE in a 36-year-old immunocompetent patient following craniotomy for a traumatic acute subdural hematoma (ASDH). Imaging after four days of progressive headache following a fall with head-strike demonstrated a 1 cm thick left holohemispheric ASDH with significant cerebral compression, edema, and 8 mm of left-to-right midline shift, and an emergent craniotomy and ASDH evacuation were performed, with additional treatment needed for reaccumulation. Postoperatively, the patient developed a worsening leukocytosis, became febrile, and was hypotensive requiring vasopressor support. Despite empiric antibiotics, the patient remained persistently febrile with significant leukocytosis. Repeat head CT showed a new left insular hypodensity and a subsequent viral encephalitis panel was positive for HSV-1. The patient was then started on intravenous acyclovir, with progressive neurological exam improvement. Of note, the patient was noted to have a positive serum HSV-1 IgG antibody titer, indicative of prior infection. Given the known systemic immunosuppression in brain injury and the high prevalence of HSV seropositivity, clinicians should consider the possibility of HSVE from HSV reactivation in TBI patients with persistent fever, leukocytosis, and/or neurological deficits without an obvious etiology."

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as an important therapeutic option for several movement disorders; however, the management of acute complications, such as acute subdural hematoma (ASDH), remains challenging. This is the case of a 71-year-old woman with Parkinson's disease who developed ASDH 12 years after bilateral DBS placement. On admission with altered consciousness, imaging revealed significant displacement of the DBS electrodes because of the hematoma. Emergent craniotomy with endoscopic evacuation was performed with preservation of the DBS system. Postoperatively, complete evacuation of the hematoma was confirmed, and the patient experienced significant clinical improvement. ASDH causes significant electrode displacement in patients undergoing DBS. After hematoma evacuation, the electrodes were observed to return to their proper position, and the patient exhibited a favorable clinical response to stimulation. To preserve the DBS electrodes, endoscopic hematoma evacuation via a small craniotomy may be useful."

    "abstract": "Hematoma expansion (H-Ex) in small-/medium-sized acute epidural hematoma (AEDH) cases upon emergency admission is critical. Predicting H-Ex can lead to early surgical interventions, improving outcomes, and eliminating the need to check for expansion via computed tomography (CT). This study aimed to identify the most reliable predictors of AEDH expansion. We retrospectively collected data from patients with pure AEDH not requiring surgical treatment upon emergency admission from 2012 to 2022. We assessed clinical and laboratory data, time from injury to the first CT, and time to follow-up CT. Factors predictive of H-Ex on the second follow-up CT, including the leakage sign (LS), were analyzed. A total of 23 patients with pure AEDH without surgery at admission were included, and LS was positive in 18. Thirteen patients showed H-Ex. The H-Ex group showed a significantly higher rate of positive LS and a lower mean platelet count than the group without H-Ex. LS's predictive value for AEDH expansion showed 100% sensitivity and 50% specificity. All patients with negative LS and normal platelet counts showed no H-Ex. Analyzing the time from injury to the first CT suggested that LS (+) within 120 minutes strongly predicted H-Ex. Reconstructed three-dimensional images of the leakage point on the skull revealed multiple mottled bleeding points on the dural surface. LS can predict H-Ex in patients with pure AEDH for whom emergency surgery is unnecessary at admission. The time from injury and platelet counts must also be considered."

This meta-analysis is to compare the clinical outcomes between the CO and DC procedures. The authors performed a meta-analysis according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JS9/C513 , Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/JS9/C514 ) Statement protocol and assessing the methodological quality of systematic reviews (AMSTAR) (Supplemental Digital Content 3, http://links.lww.com/JS9/C515 ) guideline. The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched. Comparative studies reporting the outcomes of the CO and DC procedures in patients with ASDH were included. A total of 15 articles with 4853 patients [2531 (52.2%) receiving CO and 2322 (47.8%) receiving DC] were included in this meta-analysis. DC was associated with higher mortality [31.5 vs. 40.6%, odds ratio (OR)=0.58, 95% CI: 0.43-0.77] and rate of patients with poorer neurological outcomes (54.3 vs. 72.7%; OR=0.43, 95% CI: 0.28-0.67) compared to CO. The meta-regression model identified the comparability of preoperative severity as the only potential source of heterogeneity. When the preoperative severity was comparable between the two procedures, the mortality (CO 35.5 vs. DC 38.1%, OR=0.80, 95% CI: 0.62-1.02) and the proportion of patients with poorer neurological outcomes (CO 64.8 vs. DC 66.0%; OR=0.82, 95% CI: 0.57-1.16) were both similar. Reoperation rates were similar between the two procedures (CO 16.1 vs. DC 16.0%; OR=0.95, 95% CI: 0.61-1.48). Our meta-analysis reveals that DC is associated with higher mortality and poorer neurological outcomes in ASDH compared to CO. Notably, this difference in outcomes might be driven by baseline patient severity, as the significance of surgical choice diminishes after adjusting for this factor. Our findings challenge previous opinions regarding the superiority of CO over DC and underscore the importance of considering patient-specific characteristics when making surgical decisions. This insight offers guidance for surgeons in making decisions tailored to the specific conditions of their patients."

Etiologies typically include, but are not limited to, cortical artery bleeding, vascular lesions, coagulopathies, and spontaneous intracranial hypotension. We report a case of a 45-year-old Korean male with no known co-morbid illnesses nor history of head or neck trauma, who came to the emergency department due to a 10-day history of dizziness and head heaviness, followed by disorientation and drowsiness. The patient was diagnosed with bilateral acute subdural hematoma; hence, a bilateral posterior parietal craniotomy with evacuation of hematoma was performed. Neurologic status initially improved remarkably; however, during rehabilitation, there was recurrence of acute bilateral subdural hematoma requiring repeat surgical evacuation. There was no clinical improvement after the repeat surgery, and his condition further deteriorated in the neurosciences critical care unit showing signs of rostrocaudal deterioration at the level of diencephalon. A plain cranial CT scan was performed, which showed central herniation and \"brain sagging.\" A diagnosis of spontaneous intracranial hypotension was considered; thus, the patient was managed by positioning him in the Trendelenburg position alternating with flat position on the bed. A search for the cerebrospinal fluid leak was commenced by performing a whole spine MRI constructive interference in steady state (CISS) protocol, which showed a longitudinal spinal anterior epidural cerebrospinal fluid leak from spinal level C2 to T1. Radionuclide cisternography did not provide definitive scintigraphic evidence of a leak. The patient gradually improved and was eventually transferred out of the neurosciences critical care unit. After days of rehabilitation in the hospital, the patient was discharged ambulatory with minimal support."

The clinical practices vary, with no consensus over the superiority of either procedure. To evaluate whether craniotomy or craniectomy is the optimal approach for surgical evacuation of ASDH. After a comprehensive search of PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to January 2024, to identify relevant studies, a meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model, and risk ratios were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For quality assessment, the Cochrane risk of bias tool and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale were applied. Out of 2143 potentially relevant studies, 1875 were deemed suitable for screening. Eighteen studies were included in the systematic review. Thirteen studies, in which 1589 patients underwent craniotomy and 1452 patients underwent craniectomy, allowed meta-analysis. Pooled estimates showed that there was no significant correlation of mortality at 6 months (RR 1.14;95 % CI; 0.94-1.38 P = 0.18) and 12 months (RR 1.17; 95 % CI; 0.84-1.63 P = 0.36) with the two surgical modalities. A positive association was observed between improved functional outcomes at 6-months and craniotomy (RR 0.76; 95 % CI; 0.62-0.93 P = 0.008), however, no significant difference was observed between the two treatment groups at 12 months follow-up (RR 0.89; 95 % CI; 0.72-1.09 P = 0.26). Craniotomy reported a significantly higher proportion of patients discharged to home (RR 0.63; 95 % CI; 0.49-0.83 P = 0.0007), whereas incidence of residual subdural hematoma was significantly lower in the craniectomy group (RR 0.70; 95 % CI; 0.52-0.94 P = 0.02). Craniectomy is associated with poor clinical outcomes. However, with long-term follow-up, no difference in mortality and functional outcomes is observed in either of the patient populations. On account of equivocal evidence regarding the efficacy of craniectomy over craniotomy in the realm of long-term outcomes, utmost preference shall be directed toward craniotomy as it is less invasive and associated with fewer complications."

Regarding neurosurgical trauma cases, TP is majorly encountered after chronic subdural hematoma evacuation. In this case report, we present a rare case of fatal postoperative TP encountered after craniotomy for evacuation of acute subdural hematoma (aSDH). An 83-year old gentleman was presented to the emergency department of our hospital with impaired level of consciousness. Initial examination revealed Glascow Coma Scale (GCS) 3/15, with pupils of 3 mm bilaterally and impaired pupillary light reflex. CT scan demonstrated a large left aSDH, with significant pressure phenomena and midline shift. Patient was subjected to an uneventful evacuation of hematoma via craniotomy and a closed subgaleal drain to gravity was placed. The following day and immediately after his transfer to the CT scanner, he presented with rapid neurologic deterioration with acute onset anisocoria and finally mydriasis with fixed and dilated pupils. Postoperative CT scan showed massive TP, and the patient was transferred to the operating room for urgent left decompressive craniectomy, with no intraoperative signs of entrapped air intracranially. Finally, he remained in severe clinical status, passing away on the eighth postoperative day. TP represents a rare but severe neurosurgical emergency that may be also encountered after craniotomy in the acute trauma setting. Involved practitioners should be aware of this potentially fatal complication, so that early detection and proper management are conducted."

A 70-year-old female with no obvious history of trauma was transported to our hospital. Computed tomography scan revealed an epidural hematoma of approximately 80 ml with a midline shift of 5 mm. We decided to perform an emergency craniotomy. However, the operating room (OR) was already occupied by a scheduled surgery and it would take 30 min to an hour to prepare it. We opted to wait for our OR, considering that, even if the patient was transferred to another hospital, it would take time for the craniotomy to commence. We performed TAE for the middle meningeal artery (MMA) as a palliative measure to prevent hematoma enlargement. The MMA was selectively embolized with 20 % n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (NBCA), resulting in no hematoma enlargement or observed complications. The criteria for endovascular treatment of acute epidural hematoma are not yet well-established. This case demonstrates the potential role of endovascular treatment for large acute epidural hematomas in carefully selected patients. If there is a time gap before craniotomy, TAE could be considered a viable option for large acute epidural hematomas as a palliative intervention before craniotomy."

Computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed extra-axial lesions in the left frontal and parietal lobes. Based on the initial CT findings in the emergency room, an acute subdural hematoma was suspected. However, meningiomas and other intracranial tumors were also listed as differential diagnoses because there was no history of head trauma or coagulation abnormalities on blood examination, and further imaging studies were performed. Imaging findings suggested a subdural neoplastic lesion. A partial resection was performed for the lesion. Based on histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations, the patient was diagnosed with EMZMBCL. Whole-brain and intensity-modulated radiation therapies were administered as adjuvant therapies. The patient was discharged without neurological deficits. EMZMBCL is a rare disease that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of subdural lesions, especially when there is no history of trauma or abnormalities in the coagulation system. The patient had a favorable outcome after selecting radiotherapy as the adjuvant therapy."

    "abstract": "Background Traumatic acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) is a surgical emergency and has been associated with high morbidity and mortality. However, it is not known whether mortality from ASDH occurs more frequently in a particular season. Methodology We queried the American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) from 2016 to 2019. They were identified in the NSQIP using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) code S06.5 to capture all admissions with a primary diagnosis of traumatic subdural hematoma. Mortality rates were reviewed per season, defined as three consecutive months in the year. Demographics such as age, race, ethnicity, height, and weight were reviewed. Comorbidities such as diabetes, risk factors, including smoking history, and hospitalization characteristics, such as admission year, operation year, and inpatient/outpatient treatment type, were also reviewed. Results A total of 1,656 patients were included in this study. The mean age of all participants was 70.6 years, with 37% (604/1,656) being female. The mortality rate was highest in January, February, and March at 24.5% (104/425, P = 0.045) of admitted patients compared to mortality rates of 18.8% (70/373) in April to June, 18.4% (81/441) in July to September, and 17.5% (73/417) in October to December. Conclusions Mortality is significantly greater during the winter months of January, February, and March among patients with ASDH. Despite better survival rates of ASDH over the past two decades, postoperative mortality rates still remain high."

    "abstract": "Bright tree appearance (BTA) is a characteristic finding on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with transient high intensity in the white matter. BTA is characteristic of infants with acute encephalopathy with biphasic seizures, but it has also been reported in head trauma cases. In this report, we describe an infant case of traumatic brain injury that demonstrated a biphasic clinical course and late reduced diffusion (TBIRD). A 5-month-old boy suffered from head trauma and developed coma and seizures. Computed tomography scans revealed acute subdural hematoma on the right side. He underwent an emergency operation to remove the hematoma but subsequently had seizure clusters for three days. Diffusion-weighted MR imaging revealed BTA in the right cerebral hemisphere. He was treated with antiepileptic agents and fully recovered to pre-injury condition, and MR imaging no further revealed any BTA 20 days after head trauma. He developed no complications at the 10-month postoperative follow-up. We reported a case of TBIRD following head trauma in the infant. The pathogenesis remains unclear, but we consider the possibility of biphasic seizures in infant head trauma cases, and we should appropriately administer the anticonvulsants and carefully check for MR imaging."

    "abstract": "The big black brain (BBB) phenomenon is described as an infant's response to an acute subdural hematoma (SDH). It is characterized by hypodensity and swelling of the supratentorial compartment as a whole. Numerous factors may contribute to the formation of the BBB. Due to its high morbidity and mortality, the management of BBB is still debatable. In this report, we describe a 2-month-old boy who had bilateral hemispheric hypodensity and underwent hinge craniotomy. The patient was referred to our hospital with decreased consciousness. The patient had a history of seizures and cardiopulmonary arrest. There is no history of trauma. The computed tomography revealed a subacute SDH on the left parietal and occipital lobe along with hypodensity in both hemispheres with preservation of posterior fossa, consistent with hemispheric hypodensity. We performed a hinge craniotomy for the emergency procedure and evacuated only the hemisphere with the bleeding side. The patient cried spontaneously 24 hours after the procedure and was discharged six days later. Early outcomes of hinge craniotomy as an alternative procedure for treating the BBB were positive. However, long-term outcomes, particularly the infant's development, should be monitored."

    "abstract": "Chronic subdural hematoma is a common disease in neurosurgery, but organized chronic subdural hematoma is rarely seen clinically. This article reports a case of misdiagnosis of organized chronic subdural hematoma as acute epidural hematoma. Through literature review, the causes of misdiagnosis and the treatment methods of organized chronic subdural hematoma are discussed. Case Description. A 70-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital due to headache and dizziness after head trauma. Emergency head CT reported \"left frontotemporal parietal epidural hematoma.\" Because the head CT showed that the hematoma occupying effect was obvious, an emergency \"intracranial hematoma evacuation\" was performed. After opening the skull during the operation, no epidural hematoma was seen. Upon incision of the dura mater, the outer membrane of organized chronic subdural hematoma was found. When the outer membrane was cut open, a large amount of reddish-brown silt-like materials was found in the capsule cavity. The inner membrane was not forcibly removed. Postoperative head CT showed that the organized chronic subdural hematoma was basically cleared. The early symptoms of organized chronic subdural hematoma are atypical, with insidious onset and easy misdiagnosis. By carefully inquiring about the medical history and carefully reading the head CT, such misdiagnosis can be avoided. Craniotomy is currently an important treatment option for organized chronic subdural hematoma."

    "abstract": "Acute subdural hematoma (aSDH) after traumatic brain injury frequently requires emergent craniotomy (CO) or decompressive craniectomy (DC). We sought to determine the variables associated with either surgical approach and to compare outcomes between matched patients. A multi-center retrospective review was used to identify traumatic aSDH patients who underwent CO or DC. Patient variables independently associated with surgical approach were used for coarsened exact matching.Multivariate logistic regression and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression wereconducted on matched patients to determine independent predictors of mortality. Seventy-six patients underwent CO and sixty-two underwent DC for aSDH evacuation. DC patients were21.4 years younger (P < 0.001), more likely to be male (80.6 % vs 60.5 %,P = 0.011), and present with GCS ≤ 8 (64.5 % vs 36.8 %,P = 0.001). Age (P < 0.001), epidural hematoma (P = 0.01), skull fracture (P = 0.001), and cisternal effacement (P = 0.02) were independently associated with surgical approach. After coarsened exact matching, DC (P = 0.008), older age (P = 0.007), male sex (P = 0.04), and intraventricular hemorrhage (P = 0.02), were independently associated with inpatient mortality. Multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression demonstrated that DC was independently associated with mortality at 90-days (P = 0.001) and 1-year post-operation (P = 0.003). aSDH patients who receive surgical evacuation via DC as opposed to CO are younger, more likely to be male, and have worse clinical exam. After controlling for patient differences via coarsened exact matching, DC is independently associated with mortality."

    "abstract": "Ruptured cerebral aneurysms that occur in the anterior wall of the internal carotid artery (ICA) are known as blood blister-like aneurysms (BBAs); they have been reported to account for 0.3% to 1% of all ruptured ICA aneurysms. In this report, we describe the treatment of an unusual traumatic BBA (tBBA) with high-flow bypass using a radial artery graft, which resulted in a favorable outcome. A 59-year-old female suffered from an acute epidural hematoma, traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, and traumatic carotid-cavernous sinus fistula (tCCF) after being involved in a motor vehicle accident. Her angiography results showed tCCF and a tBBA on the anterior wall of the right ICA. On the fourth day after injury, we found rebleeding from the tBBA and performed an emergency high-flow bypass using a radial artery graft with lesion trapping as a curative procedure for the tCCF and tBBA. Postoperatively, right abducens nerve palsy appeared, but no other neurological symptoms were noted; the patient was thereafter transferred to a rehabilitation hospital 49 days after injury. Traumatic ICA aneurysms commonly occur close to the anterior clinoid process, form within 1 to 2 weeks of injury, and often rupture around 2 weeks after trauma. This case was considered rare as the ICA was likely injured and bleeding at the time of injury, resulting in a form of tBBA; this allowed early detection and appropriate treatment that resulted in a good outcome."

    "abstract": "Decompressive craniectomy or craniotomy is an effective method for reducing intracranial pressure in patients with traumatic brain injury. However, contralateral intracranial hematoma is a rare but serious complication. Recently, the endoscopic technique has been described as a minimally invasive, safe, and effective treatment for intracranial hematoma evacuation. To the best of our knowledge, no technical report has described bilateral traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (TICH) evacuation using a neuroendoscope. A 62-year-old man was admitted to the hospital after a fall due to intoxication. His initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 14. Initial computed tomography (CT) revealed a right temporal skull fracture, bilateral frontal and right temporal tip contusions, and acute subdural hematoma. During admission, his condition deteriorated to a GCS score of 6 points, and follow-up CT showed hemorrhagic progression of left frontal and right temporal contusion with midline shift and brainstem compression. Emergency surgery was performed for TICH in the left frontal lobe and right temporal lobe. A burr hole was made in each of the left frontal and right temporal regions, and we used a neuroendoscope to assist in the evacuation of the hematoma. Postoperative CT showed adequate evacuation of the hematoma. The patient regained consciousness and was discharged after 2 months. Bilateral TICH was rapidly and sequentially removed by burr-hole craniotomy and endoscopic hematoma evacuation without rapid decompression by craniotomy. The hematoma did not increase. This report demonstrates that the endoscopic-assisted technique allows the safe treatment of bilateral TICH."

    "abstract": "Dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF) without cortical venous reflux (CVR) has a relatively benign course. Here, the authors describe a patient presenting with subdural hematoma due to a middle meningeal AVF without CVR. A 17-year-old male was admitted to the emergency department with acute headache without an episode of head trauma. Computed tomography demonstrated a left acute subdural hematoma (SDH). Because the nontraumatic SDH raised the suspicion of vascular pathology, emergent angiography was performed, which demonstrated an AVF fed by the middle meningeal artery and draining to the diploic vein via the serpentine meningeal vein without CVR. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no signs of venous congestion. Given the proximity of the AVF to the SDH and the MRI findings, we suspected that the serpentine meningeal vein was responsible for the SDH. The patient was successfully treated with transarterial Onyx embolization. During the injection, Onyx migrated to the extravascular space following its penetration into the serpentine meningeal vein, suggesting the meningeal vein was a bleeding source of the subdural hematoma. Despite the absence of cortical venous reflux, serpentine meningeal venous drainage of middle meningeal AVF can be a source of subdural hemorrhage."

    "abstract": "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an uncommon clinical entity in children, resulting in severe but sometimes reversible systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle. This condition is triggered by multiple emotional or physical stressors, while neurogenic stress cardiomyopathy after brain injuries has become increasingly recognized in children over the past few years. We report the case of an 11-year-old child with an atypical clinical presentation after a serious car crash accident. An initial computed tomography scan revealed an acute epidural hematoma, which was immediately treated by an emergency craniotomy. During the patient's following pediatric intensive care unit hospitalization, severe hemodynamic instability was observed, leading to gradually higher doses of vasopressors for circulatory support. On echocardiography, the patient had signs of severe cardiac contractility compromise, with characteristic pattern of regional wall motion abnormalities of the left ventricle, which, in combination with seriously elevated cardiac enzymes, electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities and continuous thermodilution hemodynamic monitoring (PICCO) findings, led to intensification of inotropic support and to the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Despite supportive measures, the patient developed multiorgan failure and succumbed to their serious illness. For this atypical case, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was addressed as an option for the seriously failing heart, but due to the extremely high risk of intracranial bleeding, it could not be used for this patient's treatment. In conclusion, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy should be suspected in pediatric cases of cardiac dysfunction after serious injuries or stress conditions."

We present a pediatric case of multiple trauma successfully treated with RT. A 9-year-old boy was injured after falling down stairs. On arrival, his blood pressure was unmeasurable, and the carotid artery pulse was barely palpable. Sonographic assessment indicated intra-abdominal hemorrhage. RT and aortic cross-clamping were performed, and he received a blood transfusion, after which his circulatory status recovered. Laparotomy indicated an inferior mesenteric vein injury that was sutured. Ten hours after arrival, an acute epidural hematoma was observed and treated with an emergency craniotomy. The patient's condition remained stable and he was discharged on the 101st day. RT may save the life of patients with multiple trauma, even pediatric patients, if performed in a timely manner, based on the diagnosis of hemorrhagic shock, along with rapid transfusion and hemostatic intervention."

Here, we describe a pediatric case of traumatic BA pseudoaneurysm accompanied by bilateral traumatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis following blunt head trauma. A 16-year-old boy presented to our emergency department after being hit by a car. The patient was initially diagnosed with multiple skull base fractures underlying traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage and left acute epidural hematoma. Seven days following emergency craniectomy, magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral ICA stenosis, BA stenosis, and BA pseudoaneurysm. We decided to perform coil embolization, resulting in body filling and a volume embolization ratio of 15.7%. Twenty-eight days after coil embolization, digital subtraction angiography revealed aneurysmal rupture. We performed repeated coil embolization, resulting in body filling and a volume embolization ratio of 20.9%. We reported a pediatric case of traumatic BA pseudoaneurysm accompanied by bilateral traumatic ICA stenosis following a severe head injury treated with repeated coil embolization. Considering the risk of further brain injury due to high incidence of rupture, early vascular survey and appropriate treatment may be the most important prognostic factors in pTICAs."

    "abstract": "Spinal epidural hematoma (SEH) is exceedingly rare, especially in children. Acute cervical epidural hematoma presents suddenly, with progressive neurologic deficits. However, it is difficult to diagnose in infants, which results in delayed diagnosis. We report a case of rapid diagnosis of traumatic cervical epidural hematoma in an infant with successful hematoma evacuation. An 11-month-old patient was brought to the emergency department after falling backward from a o30cm-high bed. The child, who previously was able to stand without support, could not stand alone and frequently fell prone when he sat down. The brain magnetic resonance imagingshowed no abnormalities. On the spinal MRI, an acute epidural hematoma located at the C3-T1 level and pressed against the spinal cord was confirmed. Three months after surgical evacuation, the Korean version of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development -III (K-Bayley-III) assessment was performed, and a developmental quotient (DQ) of 95 or higher was demonstrated for all parameters, including motor functions. This report described an exceedingly rare case of acute cervical epidural hematoma in an infant, induced by trauma. The diagnosis and treatment were performed within one day of injury. This process was significantly faster than other reported infantile cases of cervical epidural hematoma, which were diagnosed within 4 days to 2 months."

Rarely, however, neuroimaging shows other causes of third nerve palsy. In this study, we perform a literature review of spontaneous chronic subdural hematoma that, although rarely, may cause an acute pupil-involving third nerve palsy as a false localizing sign.

The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of elderly patients undergoing surgery for neurotrauma with younger patients and to identify the risk factors for mortality. We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients undergoing craniotomy or craniectomy for neurotrauma at our institution from 2012 to 2019. Patients were divided into two groups (≥70 years or <70 years) and compared. The primary outcome was the 30-day mortality rate. Potential risk factors for 30-day mortality were assessed in a uni- and multivariate regression model for both age groups, forming the basis of a 30-day mortality prediction score. We included 163 consecutive patients (average age 57.98 ± 19.87 years); 54 patients were ≥70 years. Patients ≥70 years showed a significantly better median preoperative Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score compared with young patients (P < 0.001), and fewer pupil asymmetry (P = 0.001), despite having a higher Marshall score (P = 0.07) at admission. Multivariate regression analysis identified low pre- and postoperative GCS scores and the lack of prompt postoperative prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin treatment as risk factors for 30-day mortality. Our score showed moderate accuracy in predicting 30-day mortality with an area under the curve of 0.76. Elderly patients after neurotrauma present with a better GCS at admission despite having more severe radiographic injuries. Mortality and favorable outcome rates are comparable between the age groups."

Spontaneous aSDH is a rare manifestation of aneurysmal rupture. However, aneurysmal rupture remains a major cause of spontaneous aSDH. A 42-year-old man was brought to the emergency room because of a sudden loss of consciousness during sexual intercourse. The patient has seizures and weakness on the right side of his body. The patient has no history of trauma and has never taken anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs, sexual aphrodisiacs, or other drugs. Physical examination revealed the Glasgow Coma Scale of E2V1M3, ptosis on the left eye, left pupil mydriasis, right central facial palsy, and right hemiparesis. Laboratory results showed hypercoagulopathy. Noncontrast head computed tomography scan revealed subdural hematoma with no subarachnoid or intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The patient underwent an emergency craniotomy, and the hematoma was evacuated. Cerebral angiography was performed 1 week later, revealing a saccular aneurysm in the left posterior communicating artery. The patient has successfully undergone endovascular coiling and was discharged from the hospital in good condition, fully conscious, with no weakness in half side of the body, but there is still third nerve palsy. Patients with pure aSDH without a history of trauma should consider the possibility of aneurysm rupture and perform an angiographic examination to rule out vascular malformations so that the patient can receive appropriate treatment."

To provide a basis for clinical decision-making, we analyzed that the density difference between the gray and white matter of the CT image is associated with the prognosis of patients with ASDH. We analyzed the data of 194 patients who had ASDH as a result of closed traumatic brain injury (TBI) between 2018 and 2021. The patients were subdivided into surgical and non-surgical groups, and the non-surgical group was further subdivided into \"diffused [hematoma]\" and \"non-diffused\" groups. The control group's CT scans were normal. The 3D Slicer software was used to quantitatively analyze the density of gray and white matter depicted in the CT images. Imaging evaluation showed that the median difference in density between the gray and white matter on the injured side was 4.12 HU (IQR, 3.91-4.22 HU; p < 0.001) and on the non-injured side was 4.07 HU (IQR, 3.90-4.19 HU; p < 0.001), and the hematoma needs to be surgically removed. The median density difference value of the gray and white matter on the injured side was 3.74 HU (IQR, 3.53-4.01 HU; p < 0.001) and on the non-injured side was 3.71 HU (IQR, 3.69-3.73 HU; p < 0.001), and the hematoma could diffuse in a short time. Quantitative analysis of the density differences in the gray and white matter of the CT images can be used to evaluate the clinical prognosis of patients with ASDH."

    "abstract": "Tension pneumocephalus (TP) is a rare neurosurgical emergency due to the rise of intracranial pressure from air in the cranial cavity. Tension pneumocephalus' clinical presentation ranges from headache, visual alterations, altered mental status, and death. Given its nonspecific clinical presentation, tension pneumocephalus is usually diagnosed via computed tomography (CT) imaging. Open burr hole craniotomy is the preferred treatment method for tension pneumocephalus. Subdural evacuating port system (SEPS) drains have, however, seen increased utilization in neurosurgery due to decreased possibilities for infections, reduced seizure probability, and better outcomes post-surgery, especially for elderly patients. In this article, we present the case of a 67-year-old female with postoperative tension pneumocephalus after the evacuation of an acute subdural hematoma. The patient became symptomatic from tension pneumocephalus, which was evacuated using a subdural evacuating port system drain. Post-drain placement, the patient had a radiographic and clinical resolution of her tension pneumocephalus. Thesubdural evacuating port system is a useful adjunctive tool for treating tension pneumocephalus.Given the favorable characteristic profile of subdural evacuating port system drains compared to open surgical modalities, further inquiry should be pursued to analyze the feasibility of establishing subdural evacuating port systems as a less invasive treatment alternative."

Cases were reviewed for clinical presentation, imaging findings, management, and outcome. A total of 8 patients were included in this review with an average age of 48.5 years. Six patients were women. The average Glasgow coma scale upon arrival was 6.3, and the Hunt-Hess average grade was 4.6. Aneurysm locations included posterior communicating artery (n = 3), anterior communicating artery (n = 2), middle cerebral artery (n = 2), and internal carotid artery terminus (n = 1).

    "abstract": "Determining the appropriate surgical indications for obtunded octogenarians with traumatic acute subdural hematoma (aSDH) has been challenging. We sought to determine which easily available data would be useful adjuncts to assist in early and quick decision-making. We performed a single-center, retrospective review of patients aged ≥80 years with confirmed traumatic aSDH who had undergone emergent surgery. The clinical measurements included the Karnofsky performance scale score, Charlson comorbidity index, Glasgow coma scale (GCS), and abbreviated injury score. The radiographic measurements included the Rotterdam computed tomography score, aSDH thickness, midline shift, and optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD). The neurologic outcomes were defined using the extended Glasgow outcome scale-extended (GOS-E) at hospital discharge and 3-month follow-up. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to compare the ONSD with all clinical, radiographic, and outcome variables. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between the discharge and 3-month GOS-E scores between all clinical and radiographic variables. A total of 17 patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 82.5 ± 1.6 years (range, 80-85 years), and the mean GCS score was 11.2 ± 4.1 (range, 4-15). The mean discharge and 3-month GOS-E scores were 3.4 ± 2.6 (range, 1-8) and 2.3 ± 2.1 (range, 1-7), respectively. We found significant negative correlations between the ONSD and the GCS score (r = -0.62; P < 0.01) and the ONSD and discharge GOS-E score (r = -0.49; P = 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed a significant association between the abbreviated injury score and the discharge GOS-E score (P = 0.05). Octogenarians sustaining aSDH and requiring emergent surgery have poor outcomes. More data are needed to determine whether the ONSD can be a useful adjunct tool to predict the efficacy of emergent surgery."

Subsequently, as mobility increases, injuries from traffic accidents, sports-related trauma, and self-inflicted injuries increase. In addition, there are many cases that require urgent surgical treatment for forms of injury unique to the pediatric age, such as epidural hematoma, depressed fractures and penetrating traumatic brain injury. Since pediatric head injury is a broad category encompassing all of these changes, it is necessary to appropriately address the anatomical and physiological changes in the central nervous system, and detailed treatment that takes into account the individual background can lead to a better functional prognosis. This article describes craniotomies for head injury seen in pediatric age other than acute subdural hematoma(acute epidural hematoma, open depressed fracture, and penetrating traumatic brain injury)and also describes the technique of intracranial pressure sensor insertion, which is key to intensive care for intracranial hypertension."

Therefore, we performed lumbar puncture in order to measure intracranial pressure and evaluate cerebrospinal fluid. After lumbar puncture, the patient was complaining of pain in the lumbar region. Emergency magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbosacral (LS) region was performed to show acute subdural hematoma of up to 7.3 mm in the dorsal part of the spinal canal at the level of L1 vertebra to the inferior endplate of L4 vertebra. Repeat LS MRI after 3 hours showed unchanged finding. The patient reported gradual regression of pain in the LS region over the next few days, therefore conservative treatment was applied. Patients with a previously known blood clotting disorder and patients on anticoagulation therapy have worse outcome as compared with patients without such disorders. During treatment, it is necessary to monitor patient clinical state and consider the need of surgical treatment."

    "title": "Burr hole on polyetheretherketone cranioplasty for the management of chronic subdural hematoma: A case report.",
    "abstract": "In rare cases, chronic subdural hematoma can be a complication following cranioplasty implantation. Therefore, it can develop spontaneously or after a trauma in the underlying site of a duroplasty and represent, if compression of the brain structures, a life-threatening condition. In case of a patient with cranioplasty in polyetheretherketone (PEEK), performing a burr hole on prosthesis can represent, although unusual, an effective and safe technique for evacuation of the chronic subdural hematoma, avoiding the need to remove the prosthesis itself. Nevertheless, a rare and insidious prosthesis infection can occur, even after years. A 54-year-old male patient, following severe traumatic brain injury, underwent a right hemispheric decompressive craniectomy associated to acute subdural hematoma evacuation and, subsequently, a PEEK cranioplasty implant with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE or Gore-Tex) duroplasty. About 10 years later, he experienced worsening headache with sensory alterations; therefore, he underwent a brain computed tomography scan documenting a right hemispheric chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH), expanding in subsequent radiological examinations. Because of symptoms' worsening, he underwent cSDH evacuation through a burr hole centered on the parietal region of the PEEK prosthesis, associated with mini-reopening of duroplasty. Two years after the procedure, he went to the emergency department because of the appearance of a serum-purulent material drained from the surgical site. He underwent cranioplasty removal and then started a targeted therapy to treat a triple surgical site infection, often unpredictable and totally accidental. Based on the literature evidence, performing a burr hole on a cranial prosthesis in bone-like material such as PEEK represents a surgical procedure never performed before and in our opinion could, in selected cases, guarantee the cSDH evacuation and the treatment of intracranial hypertension, avoiding the cranioplasty removal, although there is a risk of even late surgical site infection."

We report a case of pediatric AARF associated with severe head trauma requiring emergency craniotomy and was treated with conservative treatment. A 10-year-old boy was struck by a van while walking across the street. Upon admission to our trauma care center, his Glasgow Coma Scale score was 11 points (E3V3M5), pupils were 4 mm bilateral regular circles, and other vital signs were stable. Plain computed tomography (CT) revealed left acute epidural hematoma, traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral contusion, pneumoencephalopathy, and rightward deviation of the axial vertebra. We performed an emergency craniotomy due to an enlarged hematoma on a repeat head CT scan and decreased level of consciousness. Based on imaging studies, rightward deviation of the axial vertebra was diagnosed as AARF; however, since the patient was already on ventilatory management and no physical findings were obtained, conservative treatment with cervical collar fixation was started. His condition improved, and he was extubated on day 3, released from the cervical collar on day 10, discharged from the hospital on day 17, and followed-up until day 32. AARF is often caused by minor trauma or inflammation in children; however, we experienced a case complicated by severe head trauma, which was treated conservatively and showed a good clinical progress. Since AARF treatment depends on the length of time from onset, early diagnosis, in trauma care, carefully assessing factors other than major trauma, will lead to improved prognosis."

    "abstract": "A 22-year-old woman jumped from the 4th floor of her apartment in an attempt to commit suicide. Whole-body computed tomography showed multiple injuries, including right acute subdural hematoma, left hemopneumothorax, several fractures, intraperitoneal hemorrhage, and spleen injury. Her consciousness deteriorated rapidly, and her right pupil was dilated. Furthermore, she had unstable vital signs including blood pressure of approximately 70/40 mmHg, pulse about 150/minute, respiratory rate 25/minute, and percutaneous oxygen saturation of 90% on 10 L oxygen. Intratracheal intubation and insertion of a thoracostomy tube were performed in the emergency room. Due to concomitant brain herniation and hemorrhagic shock, simultaneous decompressive craniectomy for acute subdural hematoma and transarterial embolization of intraperitoneal injured arteries were performed in our hybrid operating room. Despite rapid blood transfusions, the blood pressure did not increase. After starting embolization of the injured arteries of the spleen, the blood pressure increased, thereby making it possible to remove the acute subdural hematoma, and hemostasis was then achieved. Four hours later, the acute subdural hematoma and intracranial pressure increased again, and re-operation was performed in the normal operating room. Cranioplasty and clavicular fracture reduction were performed 14 days later. She recovered enough to talk and walk, and her consciousness stabilized. Interviews with her and her family by a psychiatrist determined that abnormal behaviors had first appeared 2 months earlier. She was diagnosed with acute and transient psychotic disorders, and treatment was started. The patient was discharged home 1 month later with mild disability of her higher-order brain function."

We report here a spontaneous AEDH secondary to skull and dural metastasis of HCC. This case is extremely rare. A 48-year-old male patient with a history of HCC developed unconsciousness spontaneously. Head computed tomography showed \"a huge AEDH in the left parietal and occipital region with osteolytic destruction of the left parietal bone. Emergent operation was performed to evacuate the hematoma and resect the lesion. Pathological study revealed that the lesion was the metastases from HCC. The patient died of lung infection, anemia, and liver failure 3 wk after operation. Spontaneous AEDH caused by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) dural and skull metastases is extremely rare, the outcome is poor. So, early diagnosis is important. If the level of AFP does not decrease with the shrinkage of intrahepatic lesions after treatment, it is necessary to be alert to the existence of extrahepatic metastases. Since most of the patients had scalp and bone masses, physicians should pay attention to the patient's head palpation. Once a patient with the history of HCC had sudden neurological dysfunction, the possibility of spontaneous AEDH caused by the skull and dura mater metastases should be considered. Since hemorrhage is common in the skull HCC metastases, for patients with spontaneous AEDH accompanied by skull osteolytic lesions, it is also necessary to be alert to the possibility of HCC. For AEDH secondary to HCC metastases, early diagnosis and timely treatment are critical to improve the patients' outcomes."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous spinal subdural hematoma (SSDH) is a rare condition and causes of acute spinal cord compression, with symptoms varying from mild to severe neurological deficit. SSDH could occur as a consequence of posttraumatic, iatrogenic, or spontaneous causes, including underlying arteriovenous malformations, tumors, or coagulation disorder. Due to its rarity, it is difficult to establish standardized treatment. We present a rare case of SSDH in COVID-19 patient and course of treatment in COVID hospital. A 71-year-old female patient was admitted due to instability, weakness of the left leg, and intensive pain in the upper part of thoracic spine as well as mild respiratory symptoms of COVID-19. She was not on pronounced anticoagulant therapy and her coagulogram at admission was within normal range. MRI revealed acute subdural hematoma at the level C VII to Th III compressing the spinal cord. The patient underwent a decompressive Th I and Th II laminectomy and hematoma evacuation. Post-operative MRI revealed a satisfactory decompression and re-expansion of the spinal cord. COVID-19 symptoms remained mild. SSDH represents a neurological emergency, possibly leading to significant deficit and requires urgent recognition and treatment. One of the main difficulties when diagnosing is to consider such condition when there is no history of anticoagulant treatment or previous trauma. Since high incidence of coagulation abnormalities and thromboembolic events was described COVID-19 patients, when considering the pathology of the central nervous system, the bleeding within it due to COVID-19 should be taken into account, in both brain and spine."

We report the case of a 65-year-old man who presented with dengue fever symptoms and developed altered consciousness and focal neurological deficits. The findings of the tests showed thrombocytopenia, increased AST and ALT, positive anti-dengue IgG, and subdural hematoma on brain imaging. The urgent operations were completed satisfactorily. Dengue-related intracerebral haemorrhage is still a complicated condition. Thrombocytopenia and leukopenia are the first symptoms that point to dengue. Some risk factors, such as thrombocytopenia and increased AST and ALT, have been identified as bleeding factors in dengue fever. For a possible intracerebral haemorrhage, radiological imaging should be performed. In an emergency neurosurgery setting, thrombocyte administration could be used to monitor thrombocytopenia. Subdural hematoma is a possible dengue fever complication. If the patient's symptoms with thrombocytopenia and elevated liver enzymes indicate the possibility of intracranial haemorrhage, immediate radiological imaging should be performed."

    "abstract": "Traumatic acute subdural haematoma is a debilitating condition. Laterality intuitively influences management and outcome. However, in contrast to stroke, this research area is rarely studied. The aim is to investigate whether the hemisphere location of the ASDH influences patient outcome. For this multicentre observational retrospective cohort study, patients were considered eligible when they were treated by a neurosurgeon for traumatic brain injury between 2008 and 2012, were > 16 years of age, had sustained brain injury with direct presentation to the emergency room and showed a hyperdense, crescent shaped lesion on the computed tomography scan. Patients were followed for a duration of 3-9 months post-trauma for functional outcome and 2-6 years for health-related quality of life. Main outcomes and measures included mortality, Glasgow Outcome Scale and the Quality of Life after Brain Injury score. The hypothesis was formulated after data collection. Of the 187 patients included, 90 had a left-sided ASDH and 97 had a right-sided haematoma. Both groups were comparable at baseline and with respect to the executed treatment. Furthermore, both groups showed no significant difference in mortality and Glasgow Outcome Scale score. Health-related quality of life, assessed 59 months (IQR 43-66) post-injury, was higher for patients with a right-sided haematoma (Quality of Life after Brain Injury score: 80 vs 61, P = 0.07). This study suggests patients with a right-sided acute subdural haematoma have a better long-term health-related quality of life compared to patients with a left-sided acute subdural haematoma."

    "abstract": "Post-traumatic hydrocephalus is common after traumatic brain injury (TBI), particularly following decompressive craniectomy. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) removal by lumbar drain (LD) aids in the workup of post-traumatic hydrocephalus and serves as a bridge to definitive CSF diversion. Hemorrhagic complications following LD are rare but can include intracranial hemorrhage. We present a case of fatal brainstem hemorrhage following LD in a patient three months after craniectomy. A 32-year-old male presented with severe TBI and an acute subdural hematoma. He underwent emergent decompressive craniectomy and hematoma evacuation. The next day, he required ventriculostomy for elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), which was able to be successfully removed. Three months after the injury, the patient's neurological exam declined, and computed tomography (CT) findings were consistent with communicating hydrocephalus. An LD was placed with 15 mL of CSF and drained every two hours. Five days after LD placement, the CSF became blood-tinged, and a repeat head CT demonstrated an acute brainstem hemorrhage. The patient ultimately expired. Given the prevalence of post-traumatic hydrocephalus and the frequent use of CSF diversion in the management of this condition, it is important for neurosurgeons to remain cognizant of the potential risk for catastrophic brainstem hemorrhage following LD in decompressive craniectomy patients."

The variables associated with these postdischarge events are not fully understood. To determine factors associated with LTF and unplanned readmission, emphasizing socioeconomic status (SES). A retrospective analysis was conducted of surgical patients with acute subdural hematoma managed operatively from 2009 to 2019 at a level 1 regional trauma center. Area Deprivation Index (ADI), which is a neighborhood-level composite socioeconomic score, was used to measure SES. Higher ADI corresponds to lower SES. To decrease the number of covariates in the model, principal components (PCs) analysis was used. Multivariable logistic regression analyses of PCs were performed for LTF and unplanned readmission. A total of 172 patients were included in this study. Thirty-six patients (21%) were LTF, and 49 (28%) patients were readmitted; 11 (6%) patients were both LTF and readmitted ( P = .9). The median time to readmission was 10 days (Q1: 4.5, Q3: 35). In multivariable logistic regression analyses for LTF, increased ADI and distance to hospital through PC2 (odds ratio [OR] 1.49; P = .009) and uninsured/Medicaid status and increased length of stay through PC4 (OR 1.73; P = .015) significantly contributed to the risk of LTF. Unfavorable discharge functional status and nonhome disposition through PC3 were associated with decreased odds of unplanned readmission (OR = 0.69; P = .028). Patients at high risk for LTF and unplanned readmissions, as identified in this study, may benefit from targeted resources individualized to their needs to address barrier to follow-up and to ensure continuity of care."

    "abstract": "Acute subdural hematoma is a neurosurgical emergency. Thrombocytopenia poses a management challenge for these patients. We aimed to determine the impact of thrombocytopenia on preoperative hemorrhage expansion and postoperative outcomes. This retrospective study evaluated patients presenting at our institution with acute subdural hematoma between 2009 and 2019. Patients who underwent surgery, had thrombocytopenia (platelets <150,000/μL), and had multiple preoperative computed tomography scans were included. Case control 1:1 matching was performed to generate a matched cohort with no thrombocytopenia. Univariate analyses were conducted to determine changes in subdural thickness and midline shift, postoperative Glasgow Coma Scale score, mortality, length of stay, and readmission rates. We identified 19 patients with both thrombocytopenia and multiple preoperative computed tomography scans. Median platelet count was 112,000/μL (Q1 69,000, Q3 127,000). Comparing the thrombocytopenia cohort with the control group, there was a statistically significant difference in change in subdural thickness (median 5 mm [Q1 2, Q3 7.4] vs. 0 mm [Q1 0, Q3 1.5]; P = 0.001) and change in midline shift (median 3 mm [Q1 0, Q3 9.5] vs. median 0.5 mm [Q1 0, Q3 1.5]; P = 0.018). The thrombocytopenia cohort had higher in-hospital mortality (10 [52.6%] vs. 2 [10.5%]; P = 0.003). No significant differences were found in postoperative Glasgow Coma Scale score, length of stay, number of readmissions, and number of reoperations. Thrombocytopenia is significantly associated with expansion of hematoma preoperatively in patients with acute subdural hematoma. While the benefit of early platelet correction cannot be determined from this study, patients who present with thrombocytopenia will benefit from close monitoring, a low threshold to obtain repeat imaging, and anticipating early surgical evacuation after platelet optimization."

The incidence of AEDH without fracture is low, and the formation of an acute epidural hematoma due to contrecoup injury is even rarer. Here, the authors report a case of pediatric AEDH due to contrecoup injury. A 6-year-old boy was injured in a traffic accident and was ejected from of the car. At admission, he was clearly conscious without obvious neurological deficits. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a small fracture in the right occipital lobe and a thin epidural hematoma in the contralateral left frontal lobe. A CT scan 3 hours later showed an expanded AEDH. Furthermore, the patient presented with progressive disturbance of consciousness. An emergency craniotomy was performed, but no obvious bleeding point or fracture was observed. The source of bleeding in AEDH due to contrecoup injury in the frontal region is thought to be due to microvessel injury in the dura. Anatomical fragility and the amount of energy transferred causing the injury are associated with the AEDH formation due to contrecoup injury; thus, strict management in high-energy trauma is required."

Therefore, it is a lengthy process from the initial head trauma, if any, to the formation of an OCSDH. Acute SDH (ASDH) with organization-like, membranaceous appearances has never been reported. A 56-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a seizure, and computed tomography (CT) on admission was negative for signs of intracranial hemorrhage. She had clear consciousness and unimpaired motor functions on arrival and remained stable for the following week, during which she underwent necessary examinations. On the morning of day 10 of hospitalization, she accidentally hit her head hard against the wall in the bathroom and promptly lapsed into complete coma within 2 h. Therefore, we performed emergency CT and identified a left supratentorial SDH that was an absolute indication for surgery. However, the intraoperative findings were surprising, with no liquefaction observed. Instead, a solid hematoma covered with a thick membrane was noted that strongly resembled an organized hematoma. Evacuation was successful, but the family stopped treatment the next day due to financial problems, and the patient soon died. Neurosurgeons should address SDHs, especially ASDHs, with discretion and individualization due to their highly diversified features."

    "abstract": "Postoperative acute epidural hematoma (EDH) is a well-known serious complication that usually occurs at the operated site after cranial surgery. However, epidural bleeding, distant from the site of the previous craniotomy, is relatively rare and may sometimes cause significant neurological morbidity or even mortality. We report such a case. A 35-year-old woman, previously healthy, was operated on for a left temporo-parieto-fronto-insular anaplastic astrocytoma. Between 2 and 4 h after the surgery, the patient had trouble waking-up following the general anesthesia. Emergent computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an acute bifrontal EDH away from the initial surgical field. The patient underwent an immediate reoperation, a decompressive bifrontal craniotomy, and the evacuation of the hematoma. Despite the neurologic improvement, she died 24 days after the surgery due to severe sepsis caused by pulmonary infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa. The pathophysiology of postoperative remote EDH is poorly understood, although various hypotheses have been suggested including the loss of tamponade effect, the vasomotor mechanisms, and the coagulopathy. As seen in the present case report, we suspected that the intensive use of perioperative mannitol may also promote this complication. In the early postoperative period, every patient with neurological deterioration should have a rapid cranial CT-scan because early detection and removal of postoperative acute EDH can be life-saving."

Scalp localization of CCFL is extremely rare, we report a new case mimicking an epidural hematoma, and showing a rapid progression with aggressive infiltration of skin, calvaria, dura and brain parenchyma. A 58-year-old patient with an unlabeled polymalformative syndrome was admitted to the Emergency department following a head injury secondary to a self-resolving tonic-clonic epileptic seizure. The initial CT-scan was interpreted as a minor subcutaneous and epidural hematoma initially deemed for conservative management. Within 4 days, the patient showed a progressive neurological deterioration culminating into a stuporous status which prompted a constrast-enhanced brain MRI. The scan revealed a multilayered solid lesion, extending from the subgaleal compartment to the subdural space, threatening the integrity of overlying skin and causing infiltration of the brain parenchyma. Following emergency neurosurgical excision a definitive histology diagnosis of central follicular lymphoma was made. A focused chemotherapy with high-dose Methotrexate with R-CHOP protocol led to disease control until the latest follow up at 2 years. To our knowledge, this case represents the first CCFL invading the brain parenchyma and the second extending to the dura. Although such tumor is usually indolent the aggressive behavior herein reported extend the differential diagnosis to high-grade meningiomas, sarcomas, and metastases. Prognostication and appropriate adjuvant treatment require prompt surgical excision and histological confirmation."

Open surgery can be associated with increased morbidity and is not always possible due to systemic conditions. We present the case of a 58-year-old patient who presented with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of three fixed pupils, but remaining brainstem reflexes were present. Brain CT showed a large mixed subdural left chronic hematoma, with a predominant acute component, with a 26mm midline shift. The patient was hemodynamically unstable and coagulopathic; thus, emergency bedside burr hole evacuation was done. An \"anti-thrombotic catheter\" was left in the subdural space as a postoperative drain. Postoperatively, GCS improved, and CT presented a residual 12.7mm midline shift due to the acute bleeding component. Recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (r-tPA) solution was repeatedly administered using the catheter for two days, and it continued to drain for 10 more days with no additional dose. The patient presented clinical and radiological improvement with the dissolution of the acute component. This case is the first description of local subdural use of r-tPA to treat the acute component of cSDH with success associated with an anti-thrombotic catheter."

We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with posterior fossa ASDH right after cardiac surgery requiring neurosurgical treatment at our institution over a 7-year period and, in this study, discussed the neurosurgical strategy and clinical course. Collected data included clinical history, laboratory results, time course, symptoms, neurosurgical treatment, outcome at discharge, and imaging studies. All six patients were women who had no history of head trauma and had received antithrombotic therapy during the perioperative period of cardiac surgery. All patients showed lower platelets count and were diagnosed with ASDH within 3 days (longest time 64 h) right after cardiac surgery. After discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy and administration of reversal agents, they underwent emergency hematoma evacuation craniotomy (n = 5) or burr hole drainage surgery (n = 1), which were performed in the prone (n = 4) or lateral (n = 2) positions. Four of these patients showed favorable outcomes, and two showed poor outcomes. One of the poor-outcome patients received three antithrombotic therapies, and another developed rapidly progressive ASDH. Posterior fossa ASDH associated with antithrombotic therapy right after cardiac surgery is frequently found in women, and emergent neurosurgical treatment with anticoagulation discontinuation and reversal agent administration can be performed safely. Burr hole drainage surgery might be acceptable in nonsevere cases. By contrast, we must pay attention to cases receiving both anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs and rapid progression cases."

There were no abnormal findings apparent intraoperatively, except for oozing from the whole surface of the dura mater and epidural space. Her consciousness improved postoperatively, and her left hemiparalysis improved within a few days. No causative diseases, risk factors, or vascular abnormalities were found on laboratory and radiological surveys. Two months postoperatively, the bone flap was removed because of infection. Eight months postoperatively, a cranioplasty using artificial skull was performed, and her postoperative course was uneventful. One year after the initial surgery, she has no neurological deficits, and there has been no recurrence of epidural hematoma."

    "title": "Changing epidemiology of traumatic brain injury among the working-aged in Finland: Admissions and neurosurgical operations.",
    "abstract": "Recent studies from Finland have highlighted an increase in the incidence of traumatic brain injuries (TBI) in older age groups and high overall mortality. We performed a comprehensive study on the changing epidemiology of TBI focusing on the acute events in the Finnish working-age population. Nationwide databases were searched for all emergency ward admissions with a TBI diagnosis for persons of 16-69 years of age during 2004-2018. In the Finnish working-age population, there were 52,487,099 person-years, 38,810 TBI-related hospital admissions, 4664 acute neurosurgical operations (ANO), and 2247 cases of in-hospital mortality (IHM). The TBI-related hospital admission incidence was 94/100,000 person-years in men, 44/100,000 in women, and 69/100,000 overall. The incidence rate of admissions increased in women, while in men and overall, the rate decreased. The incidence rate increased in the group of 60-69 years in both genders. Lowest incidence rates were observed in the age group of 30-39 years. Occurrence risk for TBI admission was higher in men in all age groups. Trends of ANOs decreased overall, while decompressive craniectomy was the only operation type in which a rise in incidence was found. Evacuation of acute subdural hematoma was the most common ANO. Mean length of stay and IHM rate halved during the study years. In Finland, the epidemiology of acute working-aged TBI has significantly changed. The rates of admission incidences, ANOs, and IHM nowadays represent the lower end of the range of these acute events reported in the western world."

    "title": "Contralateral epidural hematoma after decompressive surgery: Case report and systematic literature review.",
    "abstract": "and importance: Contralateral epidural hematoma (EDH) after decompressive surgery for acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) is uncommon. If unrecognized, this delayed hematoma can lead to devastating consequences. A 30-year-old patient with no past medical history, was brought to the emergency after a severe brain injury secondary to an aggression, Glasgow coma scale was 6 (E1V1 M4) with a left anisocoria. The CT scan revealed a left acute subdural hematoma with midline shift superior than 10 mm, and a non-surgical contralateral EDH was also identified. The patient was operated on urgently. Post-operatively, the pupils became equal sized and reactive. A right anisocoria was noticed 12 h later, with a large contralateral EDH on CT scan associated to a gross midline shift. A second operation was performed immediately with a good recovery and the patient was extubated one week post-operatively. The most common surgical complications after a decompressive craniectomy for an acute subdural hematoma noted in literature are surgical site herniation, post-operative infections, epilepsy, and subdural effusions with or without hydrocephalus. Contralateral epidural hematoma (EDH) after decompressive craniectomy is also documented (Ban et al., 2010; Nadig and King, 2012) [3,15], however it's rare with only 100 cases, including the present one reported. Delayed contralateral EDH after decompressive surgery should be anticipated in the presence of contralateral skull fracture and/or intraoperative brain swelling and immediate postoperative scan is indicated. Early detection of this fatal complication and prompt treatment may improve the poor outcome in this group of patients."

    "title": "The Richmond Acute Subdural Hematoma Score: A Validated Grading Scale to Predict Postoperative Mortality.",
    "abstract": "Traumatic acute subdural hematomas (aSDHs) are common, life-threatening injuries often requiring emergency surgery. To develop and validate the Richmond acute subdural hematoma (RASH) score to stratify patients by risk of mortality after aSDH evacuation. The 2016 National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) was queried to identify adult patients with traumatic aSDHs who underwent craniectomy or craniotomy within 4 h of arrival to an emergency department. Multivariate logistic regression modeling identified risk factors independently associated with mortality. The RASH score was developed based on a factor's strength and level of association with mortality. The model was validated using the 2017 NTDB and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). A total of 2516 cases met study criteria. The patients were 69.3% male with a mean age of 55.7 yr and overall mortality rate of 36.4%. Factors associated with mortality included age between 61 and 79 yr (odds ratio [OR] = 2.3, P < .001), age ≥80 yr (OR = 6.3, P < .001), loss of consciousness (OR = 2.3, P < .001), Glasgow Coma Scale score of ≤8 (OR = 2.6, P < .001), unilateral (OR = 2.8, P < .001) or bilateral (OR = 3.9, P < .001) unresponsive pupils, and midline shift >5 mm (OR = 1.7, P < .001). Using these risk factors, the RASH score predicted progressively increasing mortality ranging from 0% to 94% for scores of 0 to 8, respectively (AUC = 0.72). Application of the RASH score to 3091 cases from 2017 resulted in similar accuracy (AUC = 0.74). The RASH score is a simple and validated grading scale that uses easily accessible preoperative factors to predict estimated mortality rates in patients with traumatic aSDHs who undergo surgical evacuation."

    "abstract": "Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an antibody-mediated drug reaction to heparin use that causes platelet aggregation, followed by thrombocytopenia. Despite the thrombocytopenia, the main complications of HIT are thromboembolic in nature rather than hemorrhagic, and in particular, intracranial hemorrhage is rare. Herein, we describe a case of atraumatic acute subdural hematoma secondary to HIT, which was treated by platelet transfusion and surgery. A 77-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for the treatment of severe aortic valve stenosis. Unfractionated heparin was administered during the preoperative period and during the aortic valve replacement surgery. Three days after the cardiac surgery, the patient presented with coma consistent with an acute subdural hematoma in the posterior fossa and obstructive hydrocephalus. Laboratory examination revealed a marked decrease of the platelet count to 40000/µL, and subsequent serological assay confirmed the diagnosis of HIT. The patient was treated by transfusion of platelets and fresh frozen plasma, and surgical removal of the hematoma. We started the administration of argatroban for substitution of heparin 4 days after the craniotomy. On day 13 after the neurosurgery, the patient developed cerebral infarction due to left middle cerebral artery occlusion and persistent right hemiparesis. We presented a rare case of the patient who developed acute subdural hematoma complicating HIT. Emergency craniotomy was successfully performed after administering platelet transfusions. Our experience with the present case suggests that platelet transfusions may be effective for performing emergency surgery for intracranial hemorrhage, even in patients with HIT."

    "abstract": "Spinal epidural hematomas are a surgical emergency, the delay in diagnosis can develop devastating sequelae due to its acute and progressive course. If not treated properly, it may lead to death or permanent neurological deficit. It is a rare condition that can occur in patients with hematologic pathology. We report a case report and literature review of a patient with antiphospholipid syndrome, who undergoes a diagnostic lumbar puncture for probable fungal meningitis. Developed a spinal acute epidural hematoma with neurological involvement that is evidenced in MRI. Urgent surgical decompression was performed with good results. Despite the low incidence of an epidural hematoma in patients who undergo lumbar puncture, it is important to perform a thorough evaluation in any patient with coagulation abnormalities prior and after a lumbar puncture, by reason of the inherent possibility of developing an epidural hematoma at the site of the procedure. In the same way, early diagnosis and aggressive treatment is necessary in patients who develop progressive neurological symptoms to limit the damage and improve the prognosis for neurological recovery."

    "title": "Severe Trauma Patients Requiring Undelayable Combined Cranial and Extra-Cranial Surgery: A Proof-of-Concept Monocentric Study.",
    "abstract": "To date, there is no evidence concerning the emergency surgical management of severe trauma patients (STP) with severe traumatic brain injury (STBI) presenting a life-threatening intracranial hematoma and a concomitant extra-cranial noncompressible active bleeding. Current guidelines recommend stopping the extra-cranial bleeding first. Nevertheless, the long-term outcome of STP with STBI mainly depends from intracranial lesions. Thus, we propose a combined damage-control surgical strategy aiming to reduce the time spent with intracranial hypertension and to hasten the admission in the intensive care unit. The main objective of the study is to evaluate the benefits of combined cranial and extra-cranial surgery of STP on the long-term outcome. We retrospectively searched through the database of STBI of a level 1 trauma center facility (Sainte-Anne Military Teaching Hospital, Toulon, France) from 2007 until 2021 looking for patients who benefited from combined cranial and extra-cranial surgery in an acute setting. The research yielded 8 patients. The mean age was 35 years old (±14) and the male to female sex ratio was 1.7/1. The trauma mechanism was a fall in 50% of the cases and a traffic accident in 50% of the cases. The median Glasgow coma scale score was 8 (IQR 4) before intubation. The median Injury Severity Score was 41 (IQR 16). Seven patients (88%) presented hypovolemic shock upon admission. Six patients (75%) benefited from damage-control laparotomy among, whom 4 (67%) underwent hemostatic splenectomy. One patient benefited from drainage of tension pneumothorax, and one patient benefited from external fixator of multiple limb fractures. Seven patients (88%) benefited from decompressive craniectomy for acute subdural hematoma (5 patients) or major brain contusion (2 patients). One patient (12%) benefited from craniotomy for epidural hematoma. Three patients presented intraoperative profound hypovolemic shock. Six patients (75%) presented a favorable neurologic outcome with minor complications from extra-cranial surgeries and 2 patients died (25%). Performing combined life-saving cranial and extra-cranial surgery is feasible and safe as long as the trauma teams are trained according to the principles of damage control. It may be beneficial for the neurologic prognostic of STP with STBI requiring cranial and extra-cranial surgery."

    "abstract": "We report a case of pure acute subdural hematoma (SDH) caused by a diploic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and it is a first case report as far as we researched it. A 19-year-old man was admitted as an emergency to our hospital with headache and nausea. CT scan on hospital admission showed a right acute SDH. Because there was no history of head trauma, MRI, MRA, and DSA were performed to identify a source of bleeding. DSA disclosed an AVF. The shunt was located between a frontotemporal branch of the middle meningeal artery (MMA) and a diploic vein, and its shunting point formed an aneurysmal sac, which was considered to have ruptured. Endovascular treatment was administered rather than surgical treatment to prevent re-bleeding because the patient was conscious and alert, CT showed a small SDH, and the left MMA near the shunting point was accessible for catheterization. A diluted mixture of 25% n-butyl-2-cyanoacrilate was injected into a left frontoparietal branch just before the shunting point and the shunt, including the aneurysmal sac, was obliterated. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful and he was discharged without neurological deficits. We experienced a patient with a pure acute SDH caused by diploic AVF. In patients with non-traumatic acute SDH, DSA is recommended to determine its underlying cause. Our review of published reports yielded few instances of non-traumatic pure acute SDH in young people. Possible causative factors should be investigated promptly and appropriate treatment provided immediately."

    "abstract": "Traumatic acute subdural hematoma (TASDH) is by far the most common traumatic brain injury in elderly patients presented to the emergency department, and a number of those treated conservatively will develop chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH). The factors contributing to chronicity were not well studied in the elderly; therefore, we retrospectively analyzed our elderly patients with acute subdural hematomas to identify the risk factors which might contribute to the development of subsequent CSDH. A retrospective analysis of 254 patients with TASDH admitted between 2012 and 2016 to our level 2 trauma department in a community hospital was collected. Data include age, sex, comorbid conditions, CT findings, anticoagulant therapy, surgical interventions, disposition after discharge, and mortality. Data on those readmitted within the first 2 months with the diagnosis of CSDH were also studied (group A), and compared to those not readmitted (group B). Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the risk factors associated with readmission at P ≤ .05. Institutional review board approval was obtained for this study. There were 254 patients who were admitted with TASDH, 144 male (56.7%) and 110 female (43.3%), with the mean age of 71.4 (SD ± 19.38) years. Only 37 patients (14.6%) went for surgery in their initial admission. A total of 14 patients (5.6%) were readmitted subsequently with the diagnosis of CSDH within two months of initial discharge (group A). Only four patients (28.5%) were on anticoagulant therapy and these patients went for emergency craniotomy for evacuation of hematoma. All 14 patients had a history of coronary artery disease and hypertension and only 5 (35.7%) were diabetic. Review of head CT on initial admission of those patients revealed 4 patients (28.5%) had multiple lesions and 4 (28.5%) had tentorial/falax bleeding and 4 (28.5%) had a shift. The initial size and thickness of the bleeding was 1.4-5 mm. The adjusted model identified diabetes, race, and initial disposition as significant risk factors (P < .05). Risk associated with the transformation of TASDH to CSDH is difficult to assess in those group of elderly patients because of the small number; however, diabetes, race, and initial disposition to home pointed toward a risk for future development of CSDH and those patients should be followed clinically and radiographically over the next few months after discharge, particularly those on anticoagulant therapy."

    "abstract": "Spinal cord infarction (SCI) is a catastrophic neurologic deficit following spine surgery. Because of the opposite management regimens used for SCI and acute epidural hematoma, accurate diagnosis of SCI is of great importance to maximally reserve neurologic functions and improve outcomes. A 21-year-old man developed acute paralysis and sensory deficits of the bilateral lower limbs shortly after undergoing two-stage combined posterior and anterior multilevel en bloc corpectomy. An emergency second-look surgery revealed wide-spectrum blackness of the thecal sac with no signs of an epidural hematoma. The patient underwent anticoagulation therapy, ventilation support, microcirculation perfusion, and fluid optimization. He regained an ambulatory status without other severe complications. Upon discharge, his muscle strength had returned to grade 4 and his Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score had decreased to 0. At the final 48-month follow-up, the implants were in good position without local recurrence, and the patient was able to lead an independent life and work in his full capacity. An epidural hematoma did not appear to be the cause of SCI after spinal tumor surgery in this case; however, SCI was a possible reason for the acute paralysis. Anticoagulation treatment with adjuvant therapies may be an effective option in managing SCI."

    "abstract": "Usually, acute subdural hematomas (ASDHs) result from head trauma and require urgent surgical treatment. However, there have been many reports of rapid spontaneous resolution of ASDHs since 1986. Recently, we experienced a case of a massive ASDH that resolved spontaneously within 1.5 days. A 76-year-old man was admitted to a local hospital after a head injury. According to his clinical records, his initial neurologic status was good (Glasgow Coma Scale score of 14). However, his head computer tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a massive ASDH to the right, with a significant midline shift. Based on his neurological status and general condition, surgery was not considered, and the patient was closely monitored in the intensive care unit. The next day, the patient was transferred to our hospital as requested by his family, after which his neurological state stabilized, and the customary follow-up brain CT was performed. It was about 32 hours after the patient's head injury, and it revealed an unexpected finding, near-total resolution of the ASDH. Herein, we review previously reported similar cases and relevant mechanisms of rapid resolution of the ASDH. We believe that neurosurgeons should comprehensively assess the patient's condition and CT findings and provide appropriate treatment, especially when surgical intervention is unnecessary."

    "abstract": "and importance: Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin is routinely prescribed after coronary artery stenting, plays a critical role in secondary prevention among patients with acute coronary syndrome and has decreased the rates of re-infarction and stent thrombosis after percutaneous coronary intervention, but they are prone to internal bleeding. Intracranial hemorrhage is the most serious bleeding complication in a patient put on antiplatelet therapy following PCI. Acute spontaneous subdural hematoma (ASSDH) without trauma is a rare event, which needs to be promptly recognized and managed. In this mini-review, we report a case of a 71-year-old man who represented spontaneous acute subdural hematoma receiving dual antiplatelet (aspirin and clopidogrel) following percutaneous coronary intervention for acute coronary syndrome. Rapid discontinuation of all of the antiplatelet drugs and hematoma evacuation were performed with good postoperative evolution. Management of hemorrhagic patients under antithrombotic therapy is very difficult. Resuming the treatment could lead to recurrence bleeding, on the other hand, suspension or stopping of treatment could expand the thrombotic risk. ASSDH after PCI is true diagnostic then therapeutic emergency, especially in patients with rapid neurological degradation. Treatment may be managed by nonoperative conservative approach in selected cases. Spontaneous subdural hematoma is a rare, serious entity, although it can engage the functional and vital prognosis of the patient, hence the interest of diagnosis and prompt treatment to improve the prognosis."

    "abstract": "Acute subdural hematoma is a devastating neurological injury with significant morbidity and mortality. In patients with large subdural hematoma resulting in compression of the underlying brain and lateral brain shift, severe neurological deficits and coma can occur. Emergent neurosurgical decompression is a life-saving intervention which improves mortality and neurological function. Persistent coma despite subdural hematoma evacuation is often the result of persistent midline shift, cerebral infarctions related to initial elevated intracranial pressure and herniation, nonconvulsive seizures, and other metabolic and infectious causes; however, a subset of patients remains comatose without a discernable etiology. In this report, we describe an elderly patient who remained comatose without a known cause for several weeks after subdural hematoma evacuation and was found to have delayed cerebral hyperperfusion on brain imaging. After several days, there was marked recovery of consciousness which occurred in a timeframe that matched improvement in brain imaging findings. Cerebral hyperperfusion following subdural hematoma evacuation requires further investigation, and should be considered as a cause of persistent but potentially recoverable coma."

    "abstract": "Recently, the incidence of traumatic brain injury(TBI)has been increased in elderly people. This study addresses the clinical characteristics of TBI in elderly people. The most frequent cause of TBI in elderly people is either falls on the ground or from heights since both motor and physiological functions are degraded such people. Acute subdural hematoma(ASDH)is the most frequent among acute traumatic intracranial lesions. Its high frequency could be possibly associated with increased volume of the subdural space resulting from atrophy of the brain in elderly people. Delayed aggravation of other intracranial hematomas have also been explained by such anatomical and physiological changes in elderly people. A recent study demonstrated that the survival rate of 2-6 days after TBI was significantly lower in the elderly people than younger adults, suggesting that \"talk and deteriorate\" may play an important role for the poor outcome in elderly people with TBI, although its mechanisms are not fully understood. Coagulopathy after TBI and pre-injury antithrombotic agents may be associated with such a delayed aggravation, making the management of TBI in elderly people in difficult. Establishing preventions and treatments for TBI in elderly people is urgent."

In this paper, we present a successful multimodality treatment of the ASSDH secondary to ruptured AVM. A 21-year-old healthy man with no history of trauma presented to our hospital with complaints of severe headache for 12 hours before admission. On examination, he was alert and oriented. He had no intracranial hypertension, meningismus, and neurological deficits. Computed tomography illustrated a right acute subdural hematoma 8mm in thickness with a 5mm midline shift and a right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage 40 × 25mm in size. Digital subtraction angiography showed a 2 × 3 cm right frontal AVM, Spetzler-Martin grade I. The feeding arteries were cortical branches of the right anterior cerebral artery, and drain veins were cortical veins. He received emergency preoperative embolization followed by hematoma evacuation and total excision of the malformation. His headache was relieved and disappeared after a week. No postoperative neurological deficits were reported. Elective surgical resection of AVM after 4-6 weeks was preferred in patients with no risk factors of rebleeding. Emergent surgery was only indicated for significant mass effect or acute hydrocephalus. Preoperative embolization is helpful for the presence of intra-nidal or peri-nidal aneurysm, AVM with high grades, reducing intraoperative blood loss and occlusion of deep vessels. ASSDH due to ruptured AVM is rare and easy to omit in clinical settings. Preoperative embolization and surgical excision are effective treatments."

    "abstract": "Prehospital care for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) varies with some emergency medical systems recommending direct transport of patients with moderate to severe TBI to hospitals with specialist neurotrauma care (SNCs). The aim of this study is to assess variation in levels of early secondary referral within European SNCs and to compare the outcomes of directly admitted and secondarily transferred patients. Patients with moderate and severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale < 13) from the prospective European CENTER-TBI study were included in this study. All participating hospitals were specialist neuroscience centers. First, adjusted between-country differences were analysed using random effects logistic regression where early secondary referral was the dependent variable, and a random intercept for country was included. Second, the adjusted effect of early secondary referral on survival to hospital discharge and functional outcome [6 months Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE)] was estimated using logistic and ordinal mixed effects models, respectively. A total of 1347 moderate/severe TBI patients from 53 SNCs in 18 European countries were included. Of these 1347 patients, 195 (14.5%) were admitted after early secondary referral. Secondarily referred moderate/severe TBI patients presented more often with a CT abnormality: mass lesion (52% vs. 34%), midline shift (54% vs. 36%) and acute subdural hematoma (77% vs. 65%). After adjusting for case-mix, there was a large European variation in early secondary referral, with a median OR of 1.69 between countries. Early secondary referral was not associated with functional outcome (adjusted OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.78-1.69), nor with survival at discharge (1.05, 0.58-1.90). Across Europe, substantial practice variation exists in the proportion of secondarily referred TBI patients at SNCs that is not explained by case mix. Within SNCs early secondary referral does not seem to impact functional outcome and survival after stabilisation in a non-specialised hospital. Future research should identify which patients with TBI truly benefit from direct transportation."

However, controversy exists on the optimal surgical options for AEDH, especially for patients with brain herniation. Neurosurgeons are confronted with the decision to evacuate the hematoma with decompressive craniectomy (DC) or craniotomy. Patients of both sexes, age between 18 and 65 years, who presented to the emergency room with a clinical and radiological diagnosis of AEDH with herniation, were assessed against the inclusion and exclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study. Clinical and radiological information, including diagnosis of AEDH, treatment procedures, and follow-up data at 1, 3, and 6 months after injury, was collected from 120 eligible patients in 51 centers. The patients were randomized into groups of DC versus craniotomy in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was the Glasgow Outcome Score-Extended (GOSE) at 6 months post-injury. Secondary outcomes included incidence of postoperative cerebral infarction, incidence of additional craniocerebral surgery, and other evaluation indicators within 6 months post-injury. This study is expected to support neurosurgeons in their decision to evacuate the epidural hematoma with or without a DC, especially in patients with brain herniation, and provide additional evidence to improve the knowledge in clinical practice.

A 5-month-old female child presented with history of fall from a height of around 2 ft., followed by incessant crying and multiple episodes of vomiting. The anterior fontanelle was lax. Plain CT scan brain showed IVH in the fourth ventricle with no hydrocephalus. Twenty-four hours after admission, the child had one episode of vomiting and became unresponsive. The child was intubated, and a repeat CT scan brain showed thick acute SDH in the posterior fossa with hydrocephalus. Emergency suboccipital craniectomy and evacuation of thick acute subdural hematoma were done. Organized clot noted in the midline between the tonsils was not removed. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) done 48 h after surgery showed ruptured dissecting aneurysm of left PICA. Endovascular temporary parent artery occlusion by coil deployment was performed, after which a check angiogram revealed complete exclusion of aneurysm from circulation. Endovascular proximal parent artery occlusion is the preferred treatment modality for dissecting aneurysms of PICA. Selective coil or Onyx embolization of the aneurysm with parent vessel preservation technique is a valid and increasingly used alternative. In this case, a novel technique of endovascular temporary parent artery occlusion by coil deployment was performed successfully. This technique may be recommended in select cases."

    "abstract": "Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML), characterized by the reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17 [t(15;17)], is a result of proliferation of myeloid cells maturation which is interrupted at the promyelocytic stage. The central, and the most important, distinguishing feature of APML is a predisposition to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The overall prognosis of APML is very good, with 90% of patients achieving complete remission. We find it important to remind pediatric practitioners, both in the ambulatory and urgent care room settings, of presenting signs and symptoms of leukemia, as well as, up-to-date on management of such fulminant scenarios as DIC. Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is one of the commonest, and frequently fulminant complication of APML seen after initiation of induction chemotherapy. We report on a young female presenting with non-specific upper respiratory illness symptoms and recurrent headache, who was found to already have ICH and to be in DIC in the setting of APML at the time of initial evaluation. This case illustrates importance of thorough assessment and prompt consideration of wide differential diagnosis, which became somewhat limited and biased towards web-based telemedicine in the COVID-19 pandemics era."

    "abstract": "The authors report a case of a patient with normal-pressure hydrocephalus treated with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt who developed a traumatic hemispheric bilateral acute subdural hematoma caused by quick cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) overdrainage. The authors present active ventricular CSF volume restoration as a novel treatment option. CSF overdrainage in patients with shunts may facilitate acute subdural hematoma formation even in cases of minor head trauma. Therapeutic options include CSF shunt function restriction or ligation, hematoma evacuation, or a combination of both. In this case, the authors performed emergency surgery with hematoma evacuation through a bilateral craniotomy and actively restored the volume of the ventricular system with a slow intraventricular injection of 37°C warmed Ringer solution through a shunt burr hole reservoir. In addition to hematoma evacuation and restriction of shunt function, the intraoperative restoration of ventricular volume could be a treatment option to prevent postoperative rebleeding or a space-occupying air collection in the subdural space. The risk of possible complications, such as ventricular or parenchymal bleeding, shunt dysfunction, or infections, requires further investigation. Restoration of the ventricular CSF volume by intraventricular injection of Ringer solution was in this case an efficient treatment method to prevent subdural rebleeding and a space-occupying air collection after subdural hematoma evacuation."

    "abstract": "Acute subdural hematoma in infants is often due to non-accidental causes such as shaken baby syndrome or abuse. Occasionally a rupture of the cerebral bridge veins after ventricular puncture can lead to a subdural hematoma in infant. In this article we report the very first case of acute subdural hematoma after ventricular puncture of cerebrospinal fluid. It is a 40-day-old male infant received at the pediatric emergency room for an infectious syndrome. An etiological assessment was carried out including a ventricular puncture of the cerebrospinal fluid. Two days after the puncture, the child develops a sudden alteration of consciousness during hospitalization, with a Blantyre coma score of 3/5. The CT scan performed showed a right subdural parieto-temporal hematoma associated with a right fronto-temporal parietal parenchymal hypodensity. A right temporo-parietal decompressive craniectomy was performed with evacuation of the acute subdural hematoma. Clinical improvement was obtained and the child was discharged after 3 weeks of hospitalization. Acute subdural hematoma post ventricular puncture is rarely reported in the literature. The mechanism would probably be a rupture of the bridging veins by sudden collapse of the parenchyma following rapid and excessive aspiration of cerebrospinal fluid. Its management is medico-surgical. This manuscript further demonstrates the importance of mastering the ventricular puncture technique which must be performed by an experienced neurosurgeon. The ventricular puncture remains a delicate gesture which must be carried out by a qualified neurosurgeon because of the risks of complications such as an acute subdural hematoma."

    "abstract": "Subarachnoid hemorrhage is typically present in cerebral aneurysm rupture, whereas acute subdural hematoma without subarachnoid hemorrhage is rare. We herein report a case of cerebral aneurysm rupture during pregnancy resulting in acute subdural hematoma without subarachnoid hemorrhage. A 37-year-old gravida 4 para 3 pregnant woman was admitted for threatened preterm labor at 294/7 weeks of gestation. At 296/7 weeks of gestation (day -14), she developed mild left eye pain, which disappeared within one day. At 316/7 weeks of gestation (day 0), she developed the sudden onset of severe headache and nausea. A neurological examination revealed no abnormal findings, and analgesics ameliorated her headache. At 321/7 weeks of gestation (day 2), after consultations with neurosurgeons, magnetic resonance imaging showed acute subdural hematoma without subarachnoid hemorrhage. Further examinations revealed a cerebral aneurysm. Emergent clipping surgery was performed with the fetus in utero in consideration of the immaturity of the fetus and stable maternal/fetal general conditions. At 356/7 weeks of gestation (day 28), her headache of unknown cause recurred. Considering the maturity of the fetus, the patient underwent cesarean section with good maternal and neonatal outcomes. The absence of subarachnoid hemorrhage does not eliminate cerebral aneurysm rupture."

However, sudden severe acute SDH caused by CML has not been reported on. Our patient was admitted for 'sudden unconsciousness for more than 1 hour'. Computed tomography (CT) angiography revealed a large amount of acute SDH on the left side. Physical exam showed the patient's left pupil was dilated and signs of cerebral herniation were present. The preoperative coagulation profile was normal. Emergency craniotomy for hematoma clearance and decompression was performed. During the surgery, a ruptured cerebral artery was located in the perisylvian region and hemostasis was achieved through electrocautery. Pre-operative white blood count was 58,100 cell/µl, with post-operative bone marrow examination、cytogenetic analysis and RT-PCR detection revealing a diagnosis of CML, for which hydroxyurea chemotherapy was initiated. Leukocyte count of the patient gradually returned to normal. After 24 days, the patient regained consciousness and on day 30, repeat CT scan showed no SDH recurrence. The patient recovered with no neurological deficits and achieved a good prognosis."

    "abstract": "Burr hole surgery in the emergency room can be lifesaving for patients with acute subdural hematoma (ASDH). In the first part of this study, a strategy of combined burr hole surgery, a period of intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, and then craniotomy was examined for safe and effective treatment of ASDH. Since 2012, 16 patients with severe ASDH with indications for burr hole surgery were admitted to Kenwakai Otemachi Hospital. From 2012 to 2016, craniotomy was performed immediately after burr hole surgery (emergency [EM] group, n = 10). From 2017, an ICP sensor was placed before burr hole surgery. After a period for correction of traumatic coagulopathy, craniotomy was performed when ICP increased (elective [EL] group, n = 6). Patient background, bleeding tendency, intraoperative blood transfusion, and outcomes were compared between the groups. In the second part of the study, ICP was measured before and after burr hole surgery in seven patients (including two of the six in the EL group) to assess the effect of this surgery. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) were significantly prolonged after craniotomy in the EM group, but not in the EL group, and the EM group tended to require a higher intraoperative transfusion volume. The rate of good outcomes was significantly higher in the EL group, and ICP was significantly decreased after burr hole surgery. These results suggest the value of burr hole surgery followed by ICP monitoring in patients with severe ASDH. Craniotomy can be performed safely using this method, and this may contribute to improved outcomes."

    "title": "Valproic Acid-Induced Thrombocytopenia-Related Spontaneous Systemic Bleeding.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Valproic acid is utilized for the management of various disease states, but coagulation changes, such as thrombocytopenia, can limit use. Valproic acid is a highly protein-bound drug. Serum levels of 50-100 mcg/mL are considered therapeutic, with minimal risk of toxicity when maintained within the recommended therapeutic index. We present a case of valproic acid-induced thrombocytopenia associated with spontaneous systemic bleeding. CASE REPORT A 57-year-old woman with history of generalized anxiety disorder and choreiform movements presented to the Emergency Department with 1 day of oral and vaginal bleeding. The patient had been started on valproic acid for choreiform movements 3 weeks prior. On physical exam, the patient was noted to have atraumatic contusions and ecchymosis. A CT head revealed left temporal frontal subdural hematoma (4.5 mm), acute subdural hematoma along the posterior aspect of the interhemispheric falx (5 mm), mass effect on the right lateral ventricle, and an approximately 3 mm right-to-left midline shift. Laboratory testing was notable for platelets 4000/μL, hemoglobin 7.3 g/dL, hematocrit 23.1%, fibrinogen 467 mg/dL, and valproic acid random level 26.3 μg/mL. Thromboelastography releveled normal values except for a decreased maximum amplitude of 33.4 mm. CONCLUSIONS Although the clinical relevance is still debated, few case reports of significant bleeding related to valproic acid-induced thrombocytopenia exist. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of spontaneous systemic bleeding due to valproic acid-induced thrombocytopenia in the setting of normal fibrinogen levels. Furthermore, this report demonstrates the potential risk of thrombocytopenia with subtherapeutic VPA levels."

    "title": "One case report of delayed severe intracerebral and intraventricular hemorrhage after cranioplasty.",
    "abstract": "Cranioplasty is a relatively simple neurosurgical procedure, and common complications of cranioplasty include dural tears, CSF leakage, infection, epilepsy, epidural hematoma and bone flap resorption. Intracerebral hemorrhage as a complication of cranioplasty is rare, and it is often fatal. The report describes one case of delayed severe intracerebral and intraventricular hemorrhage after an uneventful cranioplasty. A previously healthy 29-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a traumatic left frontotemporoparietal acute subdural hematoma, an emergency decompressive craniectomy with clot removal was performed. Four months after the surgery, cranioplasty was performed with a titanium mesh, the surgery was uneventful. Six hours after the operation, a CT scan demonstrated no bleeding or edema. In the following 2 days after cranioplasty, the patient did not have any neurological deficits, normal blood pressure was recorded every day, no trauma occurred, and routine laboratory test results were within normal limits. However, on the third day after cranioplasty, the patient suffered a sudden severe headache while playing games on his mobile phone, and then rapidly fell into deep coma; both pupils were fixed and dilated at 5 mm with no response to light. An immediate CT scan revealed a massive intracerebral hematoma and intraventricular hematoma on the left side, and the midline shifted to the right side. Therefore, an ipsilateral decompressive craniectomy was performed with evacuation of the hematoma; the obvious bleeding point was not identified, and no obvious vascular abnormalities were found during the operation. A CT scan on day 3 after reoperation revealed successful decompression, and CT angiography showed no vascular abnormalities. Despite all treatment measures, the patient did not regain consciousness, his neurological situation did not improve after the operation, and the patient lived in a vegetative state. Although intracerebral and intraventricular hemorrhage after cranioplasty is extremely rare, it is often fatal. Aside from hyperperfusion and cerebral autoregulation dysfunction, traction injuries to the fragile vessels due to posttraumatic angiogenesis may also be one of the key factors of complications after cranioplasty."

    "abstract": "Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is the most common cerebrovascular event in patients with cancer. We sought to evaluate the outcomes of surgical treatment for ICH and to determine possible pre-operative outcome predictors. We retrospectively reviewed surgical procedures for the treatment of ICH in patients with cancer. Analysis included clinical and radiological findings of the patients. Primary endpoints were survival and mortality in index hospitalization. Ninety-four emergency neurosurgeries were performed for ICH in 88 different patients with cancer over ten years. 51 patients had chronic subdural hematomas (CSDH: 54.3%), 35 with intraparenchymal hemorrhage (37.2%), 6 with acute subdural hematoma (ASDH: 6.4%), and only 2 with epidural hemorrhages (2.1%). Median patient follow-up was 63 days (IQR = 482.2). 71 patients (75.5%) died at follow-up, with a median survival of 33 days. Overall 30-day mortality was 38.3%; 27.5% for patients with CSDH. Lower survival was associated to higher absolute leucocyte count (HR 1.06; 95%CI 1.04-1.09), higher aPTT ratio (HR 3.02; 95% CI 1.01-9.08), higher serum CRP (HR 1.01; 95%CI 1.01-1.01), and unresponsive pupils (each unresponsive pupil - HR 2.65; 95%CI 1.50-4.68). Outcomes following surgical treatment of ICH in patients with cancer impose significant morbidity and mortality. Type of hematoma, altered pupillary reflexes, coagulopathies, and increased inflammatory response were predictors of mortality for any type of ICH."

    "abstract": "Patients presenting to rural emergency departments with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) can be challenging to diagnose, manage, and treat and although the presentation is rare, it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. In areas such as Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, where the majority of the province is located far from tertiary care, this problem can be compounded by adverse weather impeding transport, necessitating that the problem is handled by rural physicians instead of neurosurgical care. However, many rural medical personnel do not receive any formal training in treating increased ICP. In this technical report, we use a low-tech, low-cost, high fidelity 3D printed skull to outline a simulation of increased ICP to better prepare rural physicians and emergency department teams who may encounter such a scenario in their practice in a rural area."

    "abstract": "Brain metastases are the most common intracranial neoplasm in adult patients, and one of the fearsome complications proves to be intratumoral hemorrhage. The neurosurgical management of patients harboring a bleeding brain metastasis is not fully established and there is still today an ongoing debate on the optimal management of these patients. The aim of this article is to provide the neurosurgeons with practical tools to assist in their decision-making process in the management of BMs. We conducted a literature review of the relevant Pubmed, Cochrane, and Google scholar-indexed articles published between 2000 and 2019. The following key words were entered in the Pubmed search engine: [metastasis], [metastases], [brain metastases], [brain metastasis], [hemorrhage], [hematoma], [blood clot], [intracerebral hemorrhage], [intracranial hemorrhage]. The review was performed in accordance with the PRISMA recommendations. Based on PubMed, Cochrane, and Google scholar, 459 articles were retained, 392 were then removed because of their non-adequacy with the topic and, 9 articles were removed because they were not written in English language. So, 58 articles were analyzed. Radiological evaluation is crucial, but few traps exist. The frequency of overall brain tumor-related with intracranial hematoma is 7.2%, with a higher frequency for secondary tumors. The local recurrence rate after resection of a hemorrhagic metastasis seems to be better probably because of an easier \"en bloc\" resection thanks to the hematoma. An atypical presentation is reported in up to 4% in patients with chronic or acute subdural hematoma. Patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and epidural hematoma are rare. A clear-cut correlation between the incidence of bleeding event in brain mets and prior stereotactic radiosurgery was not established. The current literature pertaining to the neurosurgical management of acute bleeding in brain metastasis is scant and the level of evidence remains low (experts 'opinions; class C). Herein we suggest a flowchart to assist in dealing with those difficult patients."

    "abstract": "Background: Fractures of the orbital roof not associated with fractures of the orbital rim are unusual. We describe the case of a blowout fracture of the orbital roof with an intact orbital rim, which was found after craniotomy for removal of epidural hematoma. Case: A 64-year-old man was referred to our emergency department from a local hospital. He fell down from a 3-m stepladder while pruning branches of a tree. Brain computed tomographic scan revealed acute epidural hematoma in both frontal convexities, and he underwent craniotomy at the local hospital. On follow-up brain computed tomography, an orbital roof fracture with a displaced bony fragment and hemorrhage was noticed in the left superior extraconal space. Thereafter, he was transferred to our department. Upon examination, movement of the extraocular muscles was normal. He did not complain of diplopia or decreased sensation of the face. He also did not have nasal stuffiness. Exophthalmometry revealed the same findings for both eyes (18 mm/18 mm). Facial computed tomographic scan before the second operation revealed a displaced orbital roof fracture segment. Under general anesthesia, craniotomy was performed and the epidural hematoma was evacuated. The displaced bony fragment was removed from the left anterior cranial fossa, and the anterior skull base was reconstructed with a titanium mesh plate. Conclusion: Through this case of blowout fracture of the orbital roof with an intact orbital rim, found after craniotomy, we should be aware of the possibility that an orbital roof fracture can be missed on conventional brain computed tomography."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is usually a benign disease which mostly present as orthostatic headache and resolves by conservative treatment or epidural blood patch. However, in severe cases large subdural hematoma or brain caudal herniation can progress to brain herniation and neurologic complications. We introduce a rare case of SIH which presented as acute mental deterioration with unilateral acute subdural hematoma. A 60 years old female visited to emergency room for stuporous mental change and unilateral acute subdural hematoma. Decompressive craniectomy and hematoma removal was performed to release brain herniation and increased intracranial pressure. There was temporary improvement of consciousness, but sustained leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and caudal brain herniation worsened patient's condition. After recognizing that CSF leakage and hypovolemia was the underlying disease, emergent epidural blood patch and early cranioplasty was performed. After treatment CSF volume was normalized and patient recovered completely without neurologic deficits. Acute mental deterioration with unilateral subdural hematoma is a rare presentation for SIH. Treatment strategy for subdural hematoma with concomitant SIH patients, should be planned carefully with concerns to CSF hypovolemia and intracranial pressure."

    "abstract": "Only few comprehensive studies have investigated acute epidural hematoma (AEDH), and a low incidence of the lesion has been observed in comparison with other types of traumatic brain injuries such as subdural hematoma, traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, and contusion. This study aims to identify the prognostic factors of surgically treated AEDH. The medical records of 58 consecutive patients with surgically treated AEDH between September 2011 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients were diagnosed with AEDHs using 5-mm-slice computed tomography (CT). Information regarding the following demographic and clinical characteristics was collected: age, sex, antithrombotic drug use, mechanisms of injury, time from onset to operation, neurological examination, vital signs, blood examination, and CT findings. We analyzed prognostic factors in patients with AEDH using univariate and multivariate regression analyses. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses revealed that age (P < 0.01) and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS; P < 0.01) were independent predictive factors for good prognosis. In addition, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis showed that an age of <55 years and a GCS score of >12 were optimal cutoff values for predicting good prognoses, with the areas under the ROC curve of 0.827 and 0.810, respectively. Age and GCS are useful predictors of prognosis in patients with surgically treated AEDH. These findings are appropriate prognostic indicators for urgent surgery performed to treat AEDH and intended to help clinicians make a prompt diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Current guidelines do not specify timing for management of acute spinal cord injury (aSCI) due to lack of high-quality evidence supporting specific intervals for intervention. Randomized prospective trials may be unethical. Nonetheless, physicians have been sued for delays in diagnosis and intervention. The authors reviewed both the medical literature supporting the guidelines and the legal cases reported in the Westlaw and Lexis Advance databases from 1972 to 2018 resulting in awards or settlements, to identify whether surgeons are vulnerable to litigation despite the existence of guidelines not mandating specific timing of care. Timing of intervention was related to claims in 59 (36%) of 163 cases involving SCI. All 22 trauma cases identified cited timing of intervention, sometimes related to delayed diagnosis, as a reason for the lawsuit. The mean award of 10 cases in which the plaintiffs' awards were disclosed was $4,294,384. In the majority of cases, award amounts were not disclosed. Because conduct of a prospective, randomized trial to investigate surgical timing of intervention for aSCI may not be achievable, evidence-based guidelines will be unlikely to mandate specific timing. Nonetheless, surgeons who unreasonably delay intervention for aSCI may be at risk for litigation due to treatment delay. This is increasingly likely in an environment where \"complete\" SCI is difficult to verify. SCI may at some point be recognized as a surgical emergency, as brain injury generally is, despite a lack of prospective randomized trials supporting this implementation, challenging the feasibility of the US trauma infrastructure to provide care for these patients."

We report a case of a patient with PAI-1 deficiency who presented with delayed spontaneous recurrence of an acute subdural hematoma (aSDH) after evacuation. A 29-year-old male presented with altered mental status (AMS) after a fall at a construction site with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS 4T). His coagulation profile was normal, and brain computed tomography (CT) showed a left-sided aSDH. He underwent emergent evacuation of the hematoma. On postoperative day 2, he was started on heparin for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis. His neurological examination improved and was discharged with no focal deficits. Three days later, he presented with sudden AMS (GCS 7T); CT head showed a large hematoma at the site of original surgery. The hematoma was evacuated emergently. On readmission, the family informed providers that the patient had a history of PAI-1 deficiency. Postoperatively, only mechanical VTE prophylaxis was used and the patient was started on oral TXA per hematology recommendation. The patient improved and was discharged with no focal deficit. On follow-up, he remained neurologically stable. PAI-1 deficiency should be suspected in patients with delayed posttraumatic/surgical bleeding and a normal coagulation profile. If PAI-1 deficiency is evident or suspected, then a trial of antifibrinolytic agent should be used to treat and prevent recurrence of bleeding. Furthermore, chemical VTE prophylaxis should be avoided as it increases the risk for bleeding."

Although an sSDH is often associated with anticoagulation therapy, vascular malformations, or lumbar puncture, the pathogenesis of nontraumatic spontaneous sSDH remains unclear. We present the case of an intradural hematoma after an extraforaminal surgery through the Wiltse approach for an extraforaminal disk herniation at L5/S1. This 58-year-old woman experienced hypoesthesia and progressive motor dysfunction in the left leg several hours postoperation. Urgent magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intradural hematoma at the L1/L2 to L2/L3 level in the ventral dural sac proximal to the surgical level. Surgical decompression was performed. There was no evidence of trauma, coagulopathy, or anticoagulation therapy. To our knowledge, this case is the first to report an acute sSDH proximal to the surgery level after an extraforaminal spinal surgery through the Wiltse approach for an extraforaminal disk herniation. It illustrates that attentive postoperative neurologic monitoring, even in the absence of intraoperative irregularities, remains important to diagnose and treat this complication at the early stage."

The National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) dataset of the calendar year of 2007 through 2010 was accessed for the study. All blunt severe head injury patients who presented with acute SDH were included in the study. Severe head injury is defined as a head Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score ≥3 and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score ≤8. Univariate followed by propensity-matched analyses were performed to compare the two procedure groups: DC and CO. Out of 2370 patients, 518, (21.9%) patients underwent DC. There were significant differences found in the univariate analysis between the DC and CO groups for median age (38 (IQR: 22.0, 55.0) vs 49 (IQR: 27, 67), P < .001), mechanism of injury (fall: 33.2% vs 50.7%; motor vehicle crashes: 58.3% vs 40.9%, P < .001), and median injury severity score (ISS: 26.0 (IQR: 25, 38) vs 26 (IQR: 25.0, 33.0), P < .001). After propensity score matching and pair-matched analysis, no differences were found with any of the above characteristics. The pair-matched analysis also showed no significant difference in in-hospital mortality (42.7% vs 37.5%, P = .10) between the DC vs CO groups. The overall in-hospital mortality for emergency CO or DC for the evacuation of SDH remains high. The preference of one operative procedure over the other did not impact overall mortality."

On postoperative day 3, CT revealed hemispheric hypodensity, and the boy suffered from status epilepticus. MRI on the following day showed widespread white matter hyperintensity in diffusion-weighted images, and MRA demonstrated dilation of the middle cerebral artery. Perfusion MRI using the dynamic susceptibility contrast method revealed a marked increase in cerebral blood flow in the left hemisphere. These abnormal MRI and MRA findings disappeared on postoperative day 13. Status epilepticus also improved upon administration of multi-antiepileptic drugs. Fundoscopy findings on postoperative day 3 showed small bilateral petechial or brush retinal hemorrhages. However, whole-body examination did not show any problems, and was consistent with the mother's account. Thus, we judged non-abusive head trauma. Although follow-up MRI showed diffuse atrophy of the left cerebral hemisphere, the boy aged well without obvious paresis or verbal developmental delay as judged by a follow-up more than a year later. Based on these results, we speculated that hyperperfusion caused by dilation of the cerebral artery was related to the postoperative hemispheric hypodensity, namely \"Big Black Brain\"."

    "abstract": "The optimal agent to treat acute agitation in the emergency department (ED) has not been determined. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness and safety of intramuscular droperidol, ziprasidone, and lorazepam for acute agitation in the ED. This was a randomized, double-blind trial of ED patients with acute agitation requiring parenteral sedation. The study was conducted under exception from informed consent (21 CFR 50.24) from July 2004 to March 2005. Patients were randomized to receive 5 mg of droperidol, 10 mg of ziprasidone, 20 mg of ziprasidone, or 2 mg of lorazepam intramuscularly. We recorded Altered Mental Status Scale (AMSS) scores, nasal end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2 ), and pulse oximetry (SpO2 ) at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes as well as QTc durations and dysrhythmias. Respiratory depression was defined as a change in ETCO2 consistent with respiratory depression or SpO2  < 90%. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients adequately sedated (AMSS ≤ 0) at 15 minutes. We enrolled 115 patients. Baseline AMSS scores were similar between groups. For the primary outcome, adequate sedation at 15 minutes, droperidol administration was effective in 16 of 25 (64%) patients, compared to seven of 28 (25%) for 10 mg of ziprasidone, 11 of 31 (35%) for 20 mg of ziprasidone, and nine of 31 (29%) for lorazepam. Pairwise comparisons revealed that droperidol was more effective that the other medications, with 39% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3% to 54%) more compared to 20 mg of ziprasidone and 33% (95% CI = 8% to 58%) more compared to lorazepam. There was no significant difference between groups in need of additional rescue sedation. Numerically, respiratory depression was lower with droperidol (3/25 [12%]) compared to 10 mg of ziprasidone (10/28 [36%]), 20 mg of ziprasidone (12/31 [39%]), or lorazepam (15/31 [48%]). One patient receiving 20 mg of ziprasidone required intubation to manage an acute subdural hematoma. No patients had ventricular dysrhythmias. QTc durations were similar in all groups. Droperidol was more effective than lorazepam or either dose of ziprasidone for the treatment of acute agitation in the ED and caused fewer episodes of respiratory depression."

    "abstract": "Intracranial aneurysm with the first manifestation of acute subdural hematoma (aSDH) is rare in the field of neurosurgery. Usually subarachnoid hemorrhage or intracranial hematoma happens after the rupture of an intracranial aneurysm, whereas trauma is the primary cause of aSDH. Here, we present the case of a 71-year-old woman who presented with spontaneous aSDH with progressive headache and vomiting. Urgent head computed tomography (CT) identified an aSHD, but the patient had no history of trauma. CT angiography (CTA) identified the cause of the aSDH as rupture of an intracranial aneurysm in the left middle cerebral artery. Emergent craniotomy with hematoma evacuation was performed. Due to prompt diagnosis and appropriate intervention, the patient recovered fully with no disability. This unique case demonstrates that aSDH caused by intracranial aneurysm rupture requires timely identification and appropriate action to prevent adverse outcomes. We performed a comprehensive systematic literature review to examine the etiology and pathogenesis of non-traumatic aSDH. Furthermore, digital subtraction angiography should be considered in patients diagnosed with an aSDH with no known cause."

We report two cases in which acute subdural hematoma with rapid malignant brain swelling developed after repeated head traumas while snowboarding. One patient did not undergo craniotomy and died 21h after symptom onset. The other underwent urgent decompressive craniotomy and experienced prolonged disturbance of consciousness. Axial susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging performed 1 month after surgery in the second patient revealed multiple microbleeds in the subcortical white matter and parasagittal white matter in the bilateral hemispheres. These findings indicate that axonal injuries from angular acceleration may contribute to the rapid malignant brain swelling and poor outcomes."

Head CT showed the acute subdural hematoma in the left temporooccipital area and the patient underwent emergency hematoma evacuation and decompression. However, her consciousness disturbance became worse after surgery. Intermittent large negative infraslow shifts (lasting longer than 40 seconds) were recorded in the right posterior quadrant by scalp EEG with TC of 2 sec, that was defined as cortical spreading depolarizations (CSDs). Clinically consciousness disturbance sustained poor until 1 month after surgery in spite of treatment by anti-epileptic drugs. CSDs were observed on the right side where head injury most likely occurred. It may explain the sustained consciousness disturbance associated with significant prolonged ischemia. Once scalp EEG could record CSDs in this particular patient, the degree and its prognosis of traumatic head injury were estimated."

There are no prior descriptions of Idarucizumab administration in the prehospital setting for intracranial hemorrhage. An 82-year-old woman treated with dabigatran for atrial fibrillation developed acute focal weakness. This led to activation of emergency medical services and assessment in the mobile stroke unit (MSU). Computed tomography of the brain performed in the MSU revealed an acute subdural hematoma. The patient was treated with Idarucizumab in the MSU. The subdural hematoma was treated with a burr hole evacuation and the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility without residual focal neurological deficits.

    "abstract": "Interdural hematoma (IDH) is an extremely rare hemorrhage between the outer periosteal dura mater and the inner meningeal dura mater. There are 8 cases of convexity IDH reported previously but none of them were acute post traumatic one. We report the case of a patient with an initial diagnosis of acute epidural hematoma (EDH) that was eventually revealed to be an acute convexity IDH. A 57-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a complaint of falling from 2 meters. Imaging findings revealed an expanding intracranial hematoma with a linear skull fracture extending to sagittal suture, which was mistaken as an EDH. Emergent surgical evacuation was performed; the hematoma was lodged between two dural layers. This is the first case of acute convexity IDH following trauma that has been reported. In chronic and sub-acute hematomas MRI scans could be very useful, but in acute cases under emergent circumstances, CT scan cannot make a proper differentiation between an EDH and IDH. IDH should be considered during craniotomy when extradural findings do not explain the CT scan findings. This case showed a linear skull fracture expanding to the sagittal suture, and this can be a possible explanation for IDH formation. Surgical evacuation of the hematoma without inner nor outer layer resection and leaving the outer layer open, to connect the interdural space to epidural space was first described in this report."

We report a rare case of CSH wherein most of the CSH cavity was occupied with metastatic cancer cells; in addition, we review the literature. A 68-year-old man with a history of gastric cancer presented to our hospital with dysarthria and shoulder paralysis; CSH was diagnosed from preoperative imaging findings. When the hematoma was removed via a small craniotomy, besides the hematoma, we observed an abnormal mass of tissue in the capsule. Pathologically, the mass was consistent with the findings of metastatic gastric cancer. Although the symptoms immediately disappeared postoperatively, a symptomatic acute subdural hematoma with midline shift was observed on postoperative day 27. Emergency craniotomy and hematoma and tumor removal were performed. Pathologic examination showed hemorrhagic necrosis in the tumor, which had not been initially observed. The postoperative course progressed without hematoma recurrence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a CSH accompanied by tumor metastasis in most of the CSH cavity. Although rare, if a patient with cancer has CSH, the CSH should be treated considering the possibility of metastasis."

    "abstract": "Autologous bone resorption is a frequent complication of cranioplasty, often necessitating reoperation. The etiology of this phenomenon is unknown, although it has recently been associated with indolent Propionibacterium acnes infection. A 59-year-old man initially presented with a traumatic acute subdural hematoma treated with emergent decompressive hemicraniectomy and hematoma evacuation. His bone flap was cryopreserved. He underwent cranioplasty with autologous bone 3 months later. Over the subsequent 14 months, serial imaging demonstrated progressive bone flap resorption, ultimately requiring repeat cranioplasty with a custom allograft. Although there was no evidence of infection at the time of repeat cranioplasty, routine culture swabs were taken and grew P. acnes after the patient had been discharged home. Pathologic analysis of the fragments of the original bone flap that were removed demonstrated osteonecrosis with marrow fibrosis but no evidence of inflammation or infection. He was treated with 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics and had no evidence of infection at 8-month follow-up. Indolent P. acnes infection can precipitate autologous bone flap resorption. While the mechanism of this is unknown, pathologic analysis of a partially resorbed bone flap in the setting of an indolent P. acnes infection found no evidence of an infectious process or inflammation within the bone. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of action of P. acnes in bone flap resorption."

    "abstract": "Background: Non-traumatic spontaneous acute epidural hematoma (EDH) happening to chronic subdural hematoma (SDH) caused by dural metastases is a rare entity. Pathogenesis can be derived from infection, coagulopathy, and inflammation. Malignant tumors metastasize to dura mater is one of the most infrequent causes. The exact mechanism remains elusive in spite of several possible speculations. The clinical manifestations, management and outcomes vary among reported cases.Case Description: A 45-year-old woman without history of trauma presented with headache, vomiting and disturbance of consciousness and developed brain hernia rapidly. On arival, she has lost into coma with Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score 5, bilateral pupils were not equal, with disappeared reflectance. Emergency imaging prompted large acute EDH, combined with SDH, arising from dural granular neoplasm confirmed intraoperatively. Four days after surgery, the bilateral pupils were equal in size and sensitive to light reflection.Conclusion: Dural metastases can cause EDH, chronic SDH can also be resulted from metastatic tumors of dura mater. When dealing with spontaneous non-traumatic hematoma around the dura mater, to make the precise diagnosis is sometimes doubtful and confusing. The stream of diagnostic thinking should be opened, including medical diseases such as liver and kidney disease, drug history, history of cancer and other possible clues. Thus, a detailed and purposeful systematic medical history review and physical examination is important in order to make more appropriate strategies for the clinic."

During her stay in the emergency department while waiting for transfer to the children intensive care unit elsewhere she slightly deteriorated neurologically. Repeat CT scan of the brain 4 h after initial presentation remarkably showed that the subdural hematoma had now largely disappeared, with a decrease in volume and density.

    "abstract": "The major goals of anesthesia in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) are-maintenance of hemodynamic stability, optimal cerebral perfusion pressure, lowering of ICP, and providing a relaxed brain. Although both inhalational and intravenous anesthetics are commonly employed, there is no clear consensus on which technique is better for the anesthetic management of severe TBI. Ninety patients, 18-60 years of age, of either gender, with GCS < 8, posted for emergency evacuation of acute subdural hematoma were enrolled in this prospective trial, and they were randomized into two groups of 45 each. Patients in group P received propofol infusion at 100-150 mg/kg/min for maintenance of anesthesia and those in group I received ≤ 1 MAC of isoflurane. Hemodynamic parameters were monitored in all patients. ICP was measured at the dural opening and brain relaxation was assessed by the operating surgeon on a four-point scale (1-perfectly relaxed, 2-satisfactorily relaxed, 3-firm brain, and 4-bulging brain) at the dural opening. It was reassessed at dural closure. Brain relaxation, both at dural opening and closure, was significantly better in patients who received propofol compared to those who received isoflurane. ICP was significantly lower (25.47 ± 3.72 mmHg vs. 23.41 ± 3.97 mmHg) in the TIVA group. Hemodynamic parameters were well maintained in both groups. In patients with severe TBI, total intravenous (Propofol)-based anesthesia provided better brain relaxation, maintained a lower ICP along with better hemodynamics when compared to inhalational anesthesia.

    "abstract": "Controversy exists about the optimal treatment for patients with a traumatic acute subdural haematoma (ASDH) and an intracerebral haematoma/contusion (t-ICH). Treatment varies largely between different regions. The effect of this practice variation on patient outcome is unknown. Here, we present the protocol for a prospective multicentre observational study aimed at comparing the effectiveness of different treatment strategies in patients with ASDH and/or t-ICH. Specifically, the aims are to compare (1) an acute surgical approach to an expectant approach and (2) craniotomy to decompressive craniectomy when evacuating the haematoma. Patients presenting to the emergency room with an ASDH and/or an t-ICH are eligible for inclusion. Standardised prospective data on patient and injury characteristics, treatment and outcome will be collected on 1000 ASDH and 750 t-ICH patients in 60-70 centres within two multicentre prospective observational cohort studies: the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) and Neurotraumatology Quality Registry (Net-QuRe). The interventions of interest are acute surgery, defined as surgery directly after the first CT at presentation versus late or no surgery and craniotomy versus decompressive craniectomy. The primary outcome measure is the Glasgow Outcome Score-Extended at 6 months. Secondary outcome measures include in-hospital mortality, quality of life and neuropsychological tests. In the primary analysis, the effect of treatment preference (eg, proportion of patients in which the intervention under study is preferred) per hospital will be analysed with random effects ordinal regression models, adjusted for casemix and stratified by study. Such a hospital-level approach reduces confounding by the indication. Sensitivity analyses will include propensity score matching, with treatment defined on patient level. This study is designed to determine the best acute management strategy for ASDH and t-ICH by exploiting the existing between-hospital variability in surgical management. Ethics approval was obtained in all participating countries. Results of surgical management of ASDH and t-ICH/contusion will separately be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

    "abstract": "Residual hematoma after operative management of acute subdural hematoma contributes to reoperation and is cited as a reason for deferment of less invasive drainage strategies. Although local antithrombolytic therapy has been studied in intracerebral hemorrhage and chronic subdural hematoma, to date there are no reports of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator for residual hematoma post drainage for acute subdural hematoma. Two patients presented with altered mental status secondary to acute-on-chronic subdural hematomas and underwent emergent craniotomies. The first, a 78-year-old man, had poor subdural drain output and deteriorated with seizures and evidence of new acute subdural hematoma formation. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was injected through the subdural catheter on postoperative day 3. The second patient, a 64-year-old male, received recombinant tissue plasminogen activator postoperatively. Subsequently, both experienced good subdural drainage, clinical and radiologic improvement, and successful discharge to a skilled nursing facility. Subdural thrombolytic therapy can improve hematoma evacuation. A potential implication of this is facilitation of minimally invasive options such as twist-drill craniotomy, previously deferred due to inadequate evacuation. However, there is a paucity of evidence and more research is needed to substantiate the safety and efficacy, refine this technique, and guide patient selection."

We report a unique case presenting with these complications immediately after decompressive craniectomy for severe traumatic brain injury. A 65-year-old man had a right acute subdural hematoma (SDH), contusion of the right temporal lobe, and diffuse traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage with midline shift to the left side. He underwent an emergency evacuation of the right SDH with a right decompressive frontotemporal craniectomy. Immediately after the operation, his neurological and computed tomography (CT) findings had improved. However, within 1 h after the surgery, his neurological signs deteriorated. An additional follow-up CT showed a marked midline shift to the left, i.e., paradoxical brain herniation, and his skin flap overlying the decompressive site was markedly sunken. We immediately performed an urgent cranioplasty with the right temporal lobectomy. He responded well to the procedure. We suspected that a cerebrospinal fluid leak had caused this phenomenon. Decompressive craniectomy for severe traumatic brain injury can lead to sinking skin flap syndrome and/or paradoxical brain herniation even in the acute phase. We believe that immediate cranioplasty allows the reversal of such neurosurgical complications."

Previous reports analysed some of the complications associated with the application of this device for adults and children, even the indications for the use in pediatric are not well defined. An 11-year-old girl diagnosed with non-communicating hydrocephalus, caused by posterior fossa tumor. During the surgery, complications were found in the form of acute epidural hematoma due to head fixation pins. So, the operation was stopped. Emergent CT scan was carried out and showed a bilateral skull fracture and a massive right-sided epidural hematoma. An emergency craniotomy for clot removal was performed and five days later, a second surgery was carried out uneventfully for the residual tumor. The patient fully recovered after the second surgery. Complications due to the use of a pin head fixation are easier to occur in pediatric patients, because the bones are thinner and need more carefull strategy when pinning. With promp identification of any complications and earlier treatment, the good outcome will be achieved. We compared our case report with published literature in order to suggest the way to prevent this complication. Skull fractures and associated epidural hematomas in pediatric patients need to be considered as possible complications of the pin-type head fixation application. The head fixation devices in pediatric need to be used with great caution and knowing the risk factors, safe technique for application and management of complications will prevent worse outcome."

    "abstract": "Alcohol intoxication is often present concurrently with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Recent studies have looked at the effect alcohol has on TBI and on coagulopathy. Typically, cases reviewed in the current literature report only on the effects of modest alcohol intoxication. A 43-year-old male presented to the trauma center after a fall, with rapidly deteriorating mental status. Computed tomography of the head demonstrated a 1.9-cm acute subdural hematoma. Of note, classical coagulation studies were normal, but blood ethanol level was high, 436 mg/dL. Postoperatively, the patient suffered an intracerebral hemorrhage requiring emergent return to the operating room, where a large volume of unclotted blood and clinical coagulopathy was encountered. We review the literature pertaining to coagulopathy in the context of TBI and ethanol intoxication. This case is a cautionary tale of a phenomenon of unmeasured coagulopathy in the face of severe alcohol intoxication manifested by intraoperative coagulopathy with new postoperative hemorrhage. Although routine preoperative testing indicated normal clotting function, a thromboelastogram demonstrated delayed clot formation. The protective effects of alcohol are well described; however, we believe that there is a population of patients with severe acute intoxication who have coagulopathy that may go undetected by routine preoperative screening. Caution should be exercised when taking care of patients with very high levels of alcohol because physiologic derangements may be unpredictable. Additional research is needed for patients with very high levels of alcohol intoxication and the effect it may have on coagulation."

    "abstract": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cleft formation through brain parenchyma following nonpenetrating traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a rare phenomenon. Here we present a unique case of delayed CSF cleft formation months after initial injury. A 41-yr-old male presented after a fall with a right convexity acute subdural hematoma and ipsilateral frontal contusion. He underwent emergent hemicraniectomy with subsequent autologous cranioplasty 2 mo later. At 10-mo follow-up his neurological status had improved. His magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at that time demonstrated encephalomalacia at the site of his prior contusion and punctate right pontine traumatic shearing injury. The patient re-presented to clinic 13 mo after initial injury with 2 mo of progressively worsening dysarthria, left hand numbness, diplopia, and dysphagia. MRI revealed a new tubular-shaped CSF cleft extending from the fourth ventricle, through the right midbrain and thalamus that was not present on prior MRI. Computed tomography cisternogram confirmed communication with the ventricular system, and there was no clinical evidence for elevated CSF pressure. One month later, the patient's symptoms had not improved, and imaging revealed progression of the CSF cleft. Following placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, progression of the cleft ceased. We postulate that this cleft was a late sequela of traumatic shearing injury. We discuss our efforts to diagnose the etiology of the cleft and the rationale for our management strategy. To our knowledge, this represents the first reported delayed-onset CSF cleft through the midbrain and thalamus after closed TBI."

    "abstract": "We present a rare case of traumatic acute subdural hematoma (SDH) in which intracranial hypotension (IC) secondary to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage at the lumbar spine caused delayed neurological deterioration. A 70-year-old male sustained a head injury after ground-level fall and was brought to our institution. A brain computed tomography (CT) showed a thin acute SDH with mild brain shift, and conservative management was initiated. He exhibited neurological deterioration on the 9th hospital day, however, and a brain CT showed a change in CT density and marked an increase in hematoma volume and brain shift. It was thought that conversion from acute to subacute SDH was associated with the deterioration, and emergency hematoma evacuation was performed. Despite the surgery, neither clinical nor radiographical improvement occurred. The lack of improvement pointed to the presence of underlying IC, and a CT myelography revealed the dural sleeve of the right L2 nerve root as the source of the CSF leakage. An epidural blood patch therapy was performed on the 12th hospital day to seal the CSF leakage. The postprocedural course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged free of symptoms on the 20th hospital day. Spinal CSF leakage should be considered as a cause of delayed neurological deterioration in patients with traumatic acute SDH which exhibits conversion to subacute SDH."

    "abstract": "The decision whether to operate or not in patients with a traumatic acute subdural hematoma (t-ASDH) can, in many cases, be a neurosurgical dilemma. There is a general conception that operating on severe cases leads to the survival of severely disabled patients and is associated with relatively high medical costs. There is however little information on the quality of life of patients after operation for t-ASDH, let alone on the cost-effectiveness. This study retrospectively investigated patient outcome and in-hospital costs for 108 consecutive patients with a t-ASDH. Patient outcome was assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) and the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)-specific QOLIBRI questionnaire. The in-hospital costs were calculated using the Dutch guidelines for costs calculation. Out of 108 patients, 40 were classified as having sustained a mild (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 13-15), 19 a moderate (GCS 9-12), and 49 a severe (GCS 3-8) TBI. As expected, mortality rates increased with higher TBI severity (23%, 47%, and 61% respectively), whereas the chance for favorable outcome (GOS 4-5) decreased (72%, 47%, and 29%). Interestingly, the mean QOLIBRI scores for survivors were quite similar between the TBI severity groups (61, 61, and 64). Healthcare consumption and in-hospital costs increased with TBI severity. In-hospital costs were relatively high (€24,980), especially after emergency surgery (€28,670) and when additional ICP monitoring was used (€36,580). Although this study confirms that outcome is often \"unfavorable\" after t-ASDH, it also shows that \"favorable\" outcome can be achieved, even in the most severely injured patients. In-hospital treatment costs were substantial and mainly related to TBI severity, with admission and surgery as main cost drivers. These results serve as a basis for necessary future research focusing on the value-based cost-effectiveness of surgical treatment of patients with a t-ASDH."

    "title": "Bilateral Internal Carotid and Left Vertebral Artery Dissection after Blunt Trauma: A Case Report and Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "Multi-vessel cervical arterial injury after blunt trauma is rare, and its pathophysiology is unclear. Although blunt cerebrovascular injury is a common cause of cerebral ischemia, its management is still controversial. We describe a 23-year-old man in previously good health who developed three-vessel cervical arterial dissections due to blunt trauma. He was admitted to our emergency and critical care center after a motor vehicle crash. Computed tomography showed a thin, acute subdural hematoma in the right hemisphere and fractures of the odontoid process (Anderson type III), pelvis, and extremities. He was treated conservatively, and about 1 month later, he developed bleariness. Computed tomography angiography showed bilateral internal carotid and left vertebral artery dissection. Aspirin therapy was started immediately, and then clopidogrel was added to the regimen. Two weeks later, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed improved blood flow of the vessels. Only aspirin therapy was continued. About 3 months after discharge, MRA demonstrated further improvement of the blood flow of both internal carotid arteries, but the dissection flap on the right side remained. Therefore, we extended the duration of antiplatelet therapy. On the basis of our experience with this case, we think that antithrombotic therapy is crucial for the management of multi-vessel cervical arterial injury, and agents should be used properly according to the injury grade and phase; however, further study is needed to confirm this recommendation."

    "abstract": "Acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) revealing mycotic aneurysm (MA) is an exceptional occurrence. We report 2 cases of MA-related pure ASDH in the course of infective endocarditis (IE) without history of head trauma, hypertension or coagulopathy. Case 1: A 54-year-old man presented with a 10-day history of headache, fever. At admission neurologic examination and Brain-CT were normal. Blood cultures showed Streptococcus bovis. MRI 5 days later revealed ischemic spots and minime ASDH over the right convexity. Cerebral angiography, revealed a 3 mm saccular aneurysm at the bifurcation of a distal branch of the right posterior cerebral artery (PCA). Case 2: A 42-year-old man presented with a 8-day history of fever, and worsening headache. Mitral regurgitation was evidenced. A methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus left-sided IE was diagnosed. Pre- and post-contrast Brain-CT were normal. He presented 15 days later a secondarily generalized status epilepticus. Brain CT showed an ASDH over the convexity with falco-tentorial extension, midline shift and temporal herniation. It was removed in emergency. Cerebral angiography revealed a MA of a peripheral branch of the left PCA. The 2 patients were successfully treated by endovascular glue embolization and recovered without complications. Even rare, ruptured MA should be considered as a cause of pure ASDH of unknown origin. As MA can be missed on CT- and MR-Angiography because of mass effect, cerebral angiography may be mandatory."

    "abstract": "Acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) is a serious traumatic disease, and predictive methods for hematoma growth are necessary to decide whether emergent operation is necessary. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of \"leakage\" using computed tomography angiography (CTA) in patients with ASDH and to identify its prognostic value. Sixty-seven patients with ASDH were examined using CTA (mean age 64.1 ± 20.6 years; 24 men) by analyzing two serial scans (CTA phase and delayed phase). We defined a positive leakage sign as a > 10% increase in Hounsfield units (HU) in the region of interest. Hematoma expansion was determined using plain CT after 24 h in patients who did not undergo emergent surgery. Of the 67 patients, conservative therapy was administered to 35 patients; of these patients, 9 showed hematoma expansion, and 8 of these 9 patients (88.9%) showed positive leakage signs. The sensitivity and specificity of leakage signs to hematoma expansion in the no-surgery group were 88.8% and 76.1%, respectively. All positive leakage signs were found within 4.5 h of injury; patients showing negative leakage signs showed a decreased tendency towards hematoma 24 h after injury. Patients presenting with positive leakage signs had poor outcomes. The results indicated that the leakage sign is a sensitive predictor of hematoma expansion and poor outcomes in ASDH. If the hematoma is small but leakage sign-positive, strict observation is necessary and aggressive surgery may improve outcomes."

    "title": "Association of time to craniectomy with survival in patients with severe combat-related brain injury.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVEIn combat and austere environments, evacuation to a location with neurosurgery capability is challenging. A planning target in terms of time to neurosurgery is paramount to inform prepositioning of neurosurgical and transport resources to support a population at risk. This study sought to examine the association of wait time to craniectomy with mortality in patients with severe combat-related brain injury who received decompressive craniectomy.METHODSPatients with combat-related brain injury sustained between 2005 and 2015 who underwent craniectomy at deployed surgical facilities were identified from the Department of Defense Trauma Registry and Joint Trauma System Role 2 Registry. Eligible patients survived transport to a hospital capable of diagnosing the need for craniectomy and performing surgery. Statistical analyses included unadjusted comparisons of postoperative mortality by elapsed time from injury to start of craniectomy, and Cox proportional hazards modeling adjusting for potential confounders. Time from injury to craniectomy was divided into quintiles, and explored in Cox models as a binary variable comparing early versus delayed craniectomy with cutoffs determined by the maximum value of each quintile (quintile 1 vs 2-5, quintiles 1-2 vs 3-5, etc.). Covariates included location of the facility at which the craniectomy was performed (limited-resource role 2 facility vs neurosurgically capable role 3 facility), use of head CT scan, US military status, age, head Abbreviated Injury Scale score, Injury Severity Score, and injury year. To reduce immortal time bias, time from injury to hospital arrival was included as a covariate, entry into the survival analysis cohort was defined as hospital arrival time, and early versus delayed craniectomy was modeled as a time-dependent covariate. Follow-up for survival ended at death, hospital discharge, or hospital day 16, whichever occurred first.RESULTSOf 486 patients identified as having undergone craniectomy, 213 (44%) had complete date/time values. Unadjusted postoperative mortality was 23% for quintile 1 (n = 43, time from injury to start of craniectomy 30-152 minutes); 7% for quintile 2 (n = 42, 154-210 minutes); 7% for quintile 3 (n = 43, 212-320 minutes); 19% for quintile 4 (n = 42, 325-639 minutes); and 14% for quintile 5 (n = 43, 665-3885 minutes). In Cox models adjusted for potential confounders and immortal time bias, postoperative mortality was significantly lower when time to craniectomy was within 5.33 hours of injury (quintiles 1-3) relative to longer delays (quintiles 4-5), with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.28, 95% CI 0.10-0.76 (p = 0.012).CONCLUSIONSPostoperative mortality was significantly lower when craniectomy was initiated within 5.33 hours of injury. Further research to optimize craniectomy timing and mitigate delays is needed. Functional outcomes should also be evaluated."

    "abstract": "Arachnoid cysts (ACs) are congenital, extra-axial lesions containing fluid similar to the composition of cerebrospinal fluid. Usually found incidentally, these lesions are observed with serial imaging to document their growth patterns and stability, and are then followed conservatively until clinical symptoms develop. Surgical options for symptomatic arachnoid cysts include cyst aspiration, cyst evacuation with fenestration into the subarachnoid space, and shunt procedures including cysto-peritoneal and cysto-ventricular shunts. Intra-cystic hemorrhage and subdural hematoma are rare and more emergent sequelae of ACs that may require an emergent craniotomy. This case report further documents a rare cause of spontaneous subdural hematoma, as well as serves as a pivot point for further discussion into whether continued neuroimaging surveillance in patients with ACs would prove to be beneficial."

    "title": "Development of a delayed acute epidural hematoma following contralateral epidural hematoma evacuation: case report and review of literature.",
    "abstract": "The formation of a post-traumatic delayed epidural hematoma (DEDH) is a rare but well-described complication in the literature. It is defined as an extradural bleeding not evident at the first computed tomography (CT) scan performed after trauma, but evidenced by further radiological evaluations. The most supported hypothesis about the mechanism responsible for the formation of a DEDH concerns above all the loss of a tamponade effect given by the reduction of intracranial pressure with medical or surgical treatment. A 30-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department with an epidural hematoma (EDH) associated with a linear calvarial bitemporal coronal fracture. A few hours after the surgical procedure for hematoma evacuation, the patient developed a DEDH contralateral to the site of surgical procedure. The literature review identified other 27 analogue cases. The presence of a calvarial fracture contralateral to the site of a craniotomy and the intraoperative brain swelling during EDH removal are suspicious for the development of DEDH. A CT scan has to be urgently performed in this situation. The timing of postoperative radiological examinations after EDH removal has to consider possible complications and has to be balanced on the basis of patient's clinical condition and neuroradiological data, such as skull fractures or intraoperative anomalies. The development of a DEDH after the surgical removal of an EDH is a rare event, characterized by a high mortality rate. DEDH develops preferentially on the contralateral side and with a concomitant skull fracture."

    "abstract": "Acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) has been associated with mortality in traumatic brain injury. The timing of surgical evacuation for ASDH has still been controversial. The object of this study was to determine the temporal and clinical factors associated with outcome following surgery for ASDH. The study retrospectively viewed medical records and neuroimaging studies of ASDH patients who underwent surgical evacuation. Surgical outcomes were dichotomized into favorable and unfavorable outcomes, and operative times compared between the groups. The records of 145 ASDH patients who underwent surgery were reviewed. Almost two-thirds of the patients were admitted for surgical evacuation, of whom 71% underwent a decompressive operation. The temporal variables were as follows: mean time from scene of accident to emergency department (ED) was 70 (Standard deviation [SD] 256.0) min, mean time from ED to obtaining CT of the brain was 45.6 (SD 38.9) min, mean time from brain computed tomographic to operating room arrival was 68.6 (SD 50.0) min, and mean time from ED arrival to skin incision was 160.1 (SD 88.1) min. The mean time from ED arrival to skin incision was significantly shorter in the unfavorable outcome group. Because of this reverse association between time from ED to surgery, multivariate analysis was applied to adjust the timing factors with other clinical factors, and the results indicated that temporal factors were not associated with functional outcome, as features such as increased intracranial pressure due to obliterated basal cistern and brain herniation were significantly associated with functional outcome. The optimal times for surgical evacuation of ASDH are challenging to estimate because compressed brainstem signs are more important than time factors. ASDH patients with compressed brainstem should have surgery as soon as possible."

    "title": "The Diffuse and Severe Traumatic Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Being Hard to Distinguish to Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.",
    "abstract": "In primary intracerebral hemorrhage, several studies showed that contrast extravasation (CEV) is reported to be an indicator of delayed hematoma expansion, emergent hematoma removal and poor prognosis. On the contrary in head trauma, few researches validated the effectiveness of CEV because of other influences such as subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), contusion or brain swelling. The authors experienced a patient showing diffuse SAH caused by traumatic mechanism with acute subdural hematoma (ASDH). In the angiography, a notable rare image of CEV was found and emergency operation mainly to cease the bleeding points was performed. A 70-year-old man was found being comatose and brought to emergency room. Computed tomography (CT) revealed diffuse SAH with left ASDH. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) also did not clarify any abnormal vessel structure except for slightly dilatation at the part of internal carotid artery, suggesting tiny ruptured aneurysm. The authors performed a cerebral angiography and resulted in no aneurysm or arteriovenous shunt detection but revealed the extravasation from middle cerebral artery and middle meningeal artery. Follow-up CT revealed increased left ASDH though 5 hours have already elapsed. The authors performed surgical intervention to halt the bleeding. The authors experienced a notably rare image of the extravasation from middle cerebral artery and middle meningeal artery in the cerebral angiography. When an obscure arterial abnormality is suspected on CTA for the unknown origin SAH with ASDH, the authors may have an affirmative attitude toward performing conventional cerebral angiography, which is most promising modality to detect the source of bleeding including CEV."

    "abstract": "A young adult, 18 years of age, presented to the emergency department with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) resulting from a bicycle versus vehicle head-on collision. The patient initially presented in a promising condition but quickly deteriorated into a state of unconsciousness with no meaningful responses to stimuli or coordinated voluntary movement. Stat computed tomography (CT) revealed a large, right-sided, acute epidural hematoma (EDH) with mass-effect and a severe midline shift indicative of immediate surgery. This case highlights the importance of closely monitoring traumatic brain injury patients regardless of initial presentation and neurological exam results, as the patient's condition may drastically and rapidly change without much warning. Additionally, it is key to utilize regular radiological studies on these patients, to detect any neurological changes as close to onset as possible. Lastly, it is imperative that neurosurgeons closely monitor the patients/ state of consciousness as a rapid decline serves as a key diagnostic indicator of the need for immediate surgery."

    "title": "Acute Subdural Hematoma Evacuation: Predictive Factors of Outcome.",
    "abstract": "Acute subdural hematoma (aSDH) is a major cause of admission at Neurosurgical Emergency Department. Nevertheless, concerns regarding surgical indication in patients with multiple comorbidities, poor neurological status, antithrombotic therapy, and older age still persist. Therefore, a correct recognition of predictive outcome factors at hospital discharge is crucial to an appropriate neurosurgical treatment. Eighty-nine medical records of consecutive patients with age ≥18 years old who were submitted to aSDH evacuation between January 2008 and May 2012 were reviewed. Demographic characteristics, neurological status on admission, anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy, and outcome on discharge were collected. Patients with insufficient data concerning these variables were excluded from the study. Sixty-nine patients were included; 52% were male; 74% were older than 65 years; 41% were under oral antithrombotic therapy (OAT); at admission, 54% presented with Glasgow coma scale (GCS) ≤8; 23% were submitted to a craniectomy instead of a craniotomy; 26% of the patients died, 32% were dependent, and 42% were independent on discharge. Crude analysis revealed craniectomy, A/A pupils, GCS ≤8 at admission statistically significant related with the worst outcome (P < 0.05). In the adjusted evaluation only A/A pupils (P = 0.04) was associated to poor outcome (spontaneous etiology P = 0.052). Considering daily living independency at hospital discharge, either male gender (P = 0.044) and A/A pupils (P = 0.030) were related to the worst outcome. No effect of age in outcome was observed. Male gender and A/A pupils are associated with lower probability of achieving independency living at hospital discharge. A/A pupils, low GCS at admission, spontaneous etiology, and craniectomy were associated with the worst outcome. Age and OAT were not predictive factors in this series. Caution should be taken when considering these factors in the surgical decision."

    "abstract": "Atraumatic acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) associated with moyamoya disease (MMD) is rare, and only a few studies have reported the bleeding origin. We present a case of atraumatic ASDH attributable to a transdural anastomosis that developed owing to the compensatory mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of advanced MMD. This is the first case of life-threatening atraumatic ASDH associated with MMD in which the rupture point was clearly visualized using a 3-dimensional rotational reconstructed image. A 37-year-old woman presented with sudden-onset, serious, atraumatic ASDH requiring emergency decompressive craniectomy. The cerebral angiograms revealed that she had advanced MMD with transdural anastomosis that was classified as Suzuki stage V with a 5-mm saccular aneurysm in the middle meningeal artery on the affected side, which was suggested as the bleeding origin. Follow-up angiograms demonstrated that the aneurysm spontaneously disappeared and was inferred to be a pseudoaneurysm. We performed a left extraintracranial bypass to prevent recurrent hemorrhage. With intensive rehabilitation, the patient accordingly achieved stroke-free survival with a modified Rankin Scale score of 3 for 1 year. Atraumatic ASDH associated with MMD is a rare type of hemorrhagic MMD, and a 3-dimensional-rotational reconstructed image was useful to confirm the origin of the bleeding. The transdural anastomosis development most likely correlates with the occurrence of any type of hemorrhagic MMD. We should consider that the transdural anastomosis collapse can cause a life-threatening atraumatic ASDH and should plan a surgical strategy carefully so as not to destroy collateral supply through the transdural anastomosis in such cases."

    "abstract": "There is uncertainty as to the optimal initial management of patients with traumatic acute subdural hematoma, leading to regional variation in surgical policy. This can be exploited to compare the effect of various management strategies and determine best practices. This article reports such a comparative effectiveness analysis of a retrospective observational cohort of traumatic acute subdural hematoma patients in two geographically distinct neurosurgical departments chosen for their - a-priori defined - diverging treatment preferences. Region A favored a strategy focused on surgical hematoma evacuation, whereas region B employed a more conservative approach, performing primary surgery less often. Region was used as a proxy for preferred treatment strategy to compare outcomes between groups, adjusted for potential confounders using multivariable logistic regression with imputation of missing data. In total, 190 patients were included: 108 from region A and 82 from region B. There were 104 males (54.7%). Matching current epidemiological developments, the median age was relatively high at 68 years (interquartile range [IQR], 54-76). Baseline characteristics were comparable between regions. Primary evacuation was performed in 84% of patients in region A and in 65% of patients in region B (p < 0.01). Mortality was lower in region A (37% vs. 45%, p = 0.29), as was unfavorable outcome (53% vs. 62%, p = 0.23). The strategy favoring surgical evacuation was associated with significantly lower odds of mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.21-0.88) and unfavorable outcome (OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.27-1.02) 3-9 months post-injury. Therefore, in the aging population of patients with acute subdural hematoma, a treatment strategy favoring emergency hematoma evacuation might be associated with lower odds of mortality and unfavorable outcome."

We conducted a review comparing patients with ASDH with cerebral herniation who underwent single burr hole evacuation followed by decompressive craniectomy and intracranial hematoma removal surgery (n = 45, group A) and those who underwent decompressive craniectomy and intracranial hematoma removal surgery after rapid infusion of mannitol 250 mL (n = 53, group B) in our institution. Pre- and postoperative assessments included Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), activities of daily living (ADLs), and common complication incidences. At 1 and 6 months after operation, the median GCS score of group A was significantly higher than group B (P = 0.04 and P = 0.03, respectively). After 6 months, the GOS score and ADLs between the 2 groups had significant differences (P < 0.05). There were no differences between the 2 groups in the common complication incidences. Emergent single burr hole evacuation in combination with decompressive craniectomy surgery is a useful treatment for ASDH with cerebral herniation, which can achieve reduction of intracranial pressure as soon as possible and improve the prognosis."

A subset of patients who meet these criteria, including those with high Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores and coagulopathy because of medication or multiple medical comorbidities, may be treated conservatively until the hematoma can be removed by burr hole drainage. We present a series of conservatively managed surgical patients with aSDH, examining their hospital course and outcomes. Patients were included who met guidelines for surgery on admission but who had decompression delayed until it could be accomplished by burr hole drainage. Charts were reviewed for presentation, computed tomography scan findings, and outcomes. Patients were classified according to outcome and whether their eventual surgery was scheduled or emergent. Eighteen patients were included with a mean age of 70.2 years. Average GCS score at presentation was 14.6 ± 0.6. Most patients were using some form of blood-thinning medication at presentation (72.2%). Admission CT scan revealed aSDH with a mean width of 13.6 mm and midline shift of 6.6 mm. Average total length of stay was 28.4 ± 17.0 days, of which 14.2 ± 9.2 days were spent in the intensive care unit. Outcomes were generally acceptable, with an average Glasgow Outcome Scale score at discharge of 3.8 ± 1.4. There were only 2 deaths, neither of which was related to the initial trauma or a neurologic process. Delayed treatment of aSDH by burr hole drainage is an effective option in certain patients who are suboptimal craniotomy candidates. Acceptable outcomes may be achievable with this conservative approach, when applied in appropriate patients."

    "abstract": "Prior studies have shown that most patients with mild traumatic brain injury or negative computed tomography (CT) scans of the head rarely decline or require neurosurgical interventions. One common reason for a delayed decline is an intracranial hemorrhage that presents within 24-48 hours. This is typically seen in elderly patients and/or patients on antiplatelet or anticoagulation agents. We describe a case of a delayed subdural hemorrhage presenting in a young adult not on any antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy. A 19-year-old male presented to the emergency department after being involved in a motor vehicle accident. He had a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15, and an initial CT was negative for any intracranial hemorrhage or pathology, so he was then admitted to the intensive care unit for further care. The patient received 1 dose of aspirin 325 mg the following day for treatment of blunt cerebrovascular injury. Six hours later he reported a severe headache and had an episode of emesis with a subsequent rapid neurologic decline. Repeat CT showed an acute right subdural hematoma, and he underwent an emergent right decompressive hemicraniectomy. In rare cases, patients with negative initial head CT scans neurologically deteriorate as a result of a delayed acute subdural hematoma. We present an unusual case of a young patient on no medications with no CT findings of an intracranial injury who neurologically declined due to a delayed acute subdural hematoma."

Post-cranioplasty autologous bone flap resorption may occur in patients after delayed cranial reconstruction. The occurrence is usually low when bone flaps are stored in subcutaneous abdominal tissue. We report a unique case of post-cranioplasty cranial bone flap. We report a total autologous bone flap resorption in a 28-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse. He was found unconscious in his bedroom with a head trauma of unknown mechanism. After an emergency room assessment, he was diagnosed with an acute subdural hematoma and underwent to emergency surgical drainage and a craniectomy. Three months later, a cranioplasty was performed and he exhibited exceptional outcomes. During a follow-up assessment, 7 months post-cranioplasty, total bone flap resorption was observed on computerized tomography image. This case described an abnormal accelerated resorption of an autologous bone flap cranioplasty inserted after 3 months. Thus, to avoid bone flap resorption, an as early as possibly strategy may prevent this. Still, the exact mechanisms underlying bone resorption are poorly understood."

Cervical epidural hematoma occurs in extremely rare cases after cervical manipulation therapy. This study reports a case of epidural hematoma that occurred in the anterior spinal cord after cervical massage. A 38-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency department for sudden weakness in the lower extremity after receiving a cervical spine massage. No fracture was found using cervical radiographs, and there were no particular findings on performing brain computed tomography or diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. However, using cervical magnetic resonance imaging, an acute epidural hematoma was observed in the anterior spinal cord from the C6 and C7 vertebrae to the T1 vertebra, compressing the spinal cord. There were no fractures or ligament injury. No surgical treatment was required as the patient showed spontaneous improvements in muscle strength and was discharged after just 1 week, following observation of the improvement in his symptoms. Although cervical epidural hematoma after cervical manipulation therapy is extremely rare, if suspected, a thorough examination must be performed in order to reduce the chances of serious neurologic sequelae."

We report a young case and discuss its difficulties and tips.A 31-year-old man was found to be in a state of general convulsion. At the time of admission, we observed severe consciousness disturbance, anisocoria, and left hemiparesis. Computed tomography showed a massive subdural hematoma with marked midline shift. Osmotherapy and emergency trepanation improved anisocoria. An endoscopic procedure under local anesthesia was sequentially selected. After surgery, the patient's symptoms clearly improved. Although the standard treatment for ASDH is craniotomy, endoscopic surgery may be useful in some cases."

    "abstract": "Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is a common intracranial hematoma. The number of patients who undergo anticoagulant therapy including a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) is expected to increase. Recently, idarucizumab, the antidote for dabigatran, which is a DOAC, has been developed. We successfully treated CSDH with dabigatran using emergency burr hole surgery and idarucizumab. A 79-year-old Japanese man severely hit his head and visited the emergency department. Computed tomography (CT) showed tiny traumatic acute subdural hematoma, for which he was admitted. At that time, atrial fibrillation was newly detected, for which dabigatran, having a specific antidote (idarucizumab), was chosen and started 2 weeks after the discharge. Two months after the trauma episode, he revisited the emergency department because of acute left upper and lower limb motor weakness. CT revealed a midline shifted CSDH. Considering rush course of motor weakness and shifted brain, we performed emergency surgery using an antidote for dabigatran, idarucizumab. He was discharged 5 days after surgery without any complications or excessive perioperative hemorrhage. Dabigatran should be used for atrial fibrillation detected after head trauma. Emergency surgery can be safely performed for CSDH with dabigatran using idarucizumab."

    "abstract": "Mild hemophilia without spontaneous bleeding can remain undiagnosed for a lifetime. However, intracranial hemorrhage is one of the most serious complications for patients with hemophilia. In addition, hemorrhagic complications after emergency surgery tend to arise from coagulopathy. An 80-year-old man was admitted with left hemiparesis and disturbed consciousness. He had no history of trauma, fever, or drug and alcohol intake. Computed tomography imaging upon admission disclosed a hemispheric subdural hematoma with a midline shift. No vascular abnormalities were identified as a source of the hemorrhage. The hematoma was removed on an emergency basis with external decompression. However, a large subcutaneous hematoma was again evident on the following day. Insufficient hemostatic maneuvers during surgery were considered the cause of this hemorrhagic complication. A second operation was performed to achieve hemostasis of the subcutaneous and muscle tissue. Thereafter, he was rehabilitated without treatment for hemophilia as he had no bleeding episodes. Cranioplasty proceeded using artificial bone at 40 days after the first operation. However, epidural hematoma developed again on postoperative day 1. His neurological status did not worsen so a repeat procedure was unnecessary. Close scrutiny uncovered a diagnosis of mild hemophilia A. Accurate diagnosis is important for the management of postoperative hemorrhagic complications caused by pathologies of the coagulation system. Sufficient hemostasis of hemorrhage from subcutaneous and muscle tissue is essential even during emergency surgery to avoid postoperative complications. A diagnosis of hemophilia should be considered in the face of prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)."

    "abstract": "Treprostinil is a prostacyclin analog used to treat portopulmonary hypertension (PPHTN) and is one of several drugs shown to increase survival, but results in platelet dysfunction. Little is known about the management of patients on treprostinil who present with an acute subdural hematoma (aSDH). We describe such a case and offer our recommendations on management based on our experience and review of the literature. A 63-year-old, right-handed female with a history of PPHTN presented with severe headache and was found to have a large left aSDH with midline shift on imaging. She was admitted to the neurosurgical intensive care unit (ICU) where she developed hemiparesis and subsequently underwent emergent decompression. Postoperatively she improved, but several hours after became obtunded and imaging showed reaccumulation of the aSDH, which required reoperation. At 6 months postoperatively she had only a mild hemiparesis and was being reconsidered for treprostinil therapy as a bridge to liver transplant. Only one paper in the literature thus far has reported a patient with an aSDH managed with treprostinil. The authors achieved adequate intraoperative hemostasis without the use of platelet transfusion and lack of complications intraoperatively. While concerns related to the risk of bleeding in surgery are valid, intraoperative hemostasis does not appear to be profoundly affected. Surgical intervention should not be delayed and prostanoid therapy discontinued, if possible, postoperatively. Patients should be placed in an intensive care setting with assistance from pulmonary specialists and close monitoring of neurological status and blood pressure."

    "abstract": "In Austria approximately 2000 people suffer from severe brain injury per year. Brain trauma is the most common cause of death under the age of 45 years. In polytrauma patients the treatment and management of severe brain injury is particularly challenging because the life-threatening injuries of other organ systems significantly influence the timing of surgery and the outcome. The sequence of the necessary surgery is an interdisciplinary decision already made in the emergency room. The evacuation of space-occupying intracranial hemorrhage can be of secondary importance. The standard approach for acute subdural hematoma is a craniotomy using a large question mark-shaped incision (trauma flap) and decompression. In acute epidural hematoma and impression fractures the localization of the lesion determines the surgical approach and evacuation. A variety of access procedures are available. Frontobasal injuries are extremely rarely an indication for an emergency operation for life-threatening injuries. Decompressive craniotomy is performed as for craniotomy for acute subdural hematoma by the standard trauma flap. Emergency room computed tomography provides fast and accurate information about the localization and extent of brain injury. The mortality of acute subdural hematoma ranges between 50-90% despite an adequate evacuation. Outcome of epidural hematoma has a much better prognosis (10% mortality). The results of decompressive craniectomy versus conservative treatment for moderate disability and good recovery are quite similar according to the randomized evaluation of surgery with craniectomy for uncontrolled elevation of intracranial pressure (RESCUE-ICP) study. Interdisciplinary cooperation and communication and well-trained trauma surgeons with experience in brain trauma are key factors in the treatment of severe brain injury in polytrauma patients."

We report a case of nontraumatic pure acute SDH caused by the rupture of a cortical middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm. A 43-year-old man with no antecedents, except hypertension, presented to the emergency department with acute-onset moderate headache and nausea after swimming. He reported neither preceding head trauma nor dental check-up. Neurological examinations and laboratory tests were unremarkable. Computed tomography (CT) showed an acute SDH on the left convexity without SAH, but both magnetic resonance (MR) angiography and three-dimensional CT (3D-CT) angiography disclosed no vascular abnormality. As he became drowsy, the patient emergently underwent an evacuation of the SDH. Unexpectedly, a small saccular aneurysm of a cortical branch of the left MCA was recognized at surgery. Although indocyanine green (ICG) angiography revealed this aneurysm was thrombosed, a clip was applied on the aneurysmal base. He was discharged home without any complications 21 days after admission. To seek the cause of nontraumatic acute SDH, supplementary examinations including 3D-CT, MR, and/or catheter angiography are necessary. Even if angiography reveals no vascular lesions, the present case warrants that the cortical surface should be meticulously inspected at surgery, because a thrombosed cortical artery aneurysm might be an underlying cause."

    "abstract": "We report a case of tentorial dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) with a severe intracranial hemorrhage occurring after Onyx embolization. A 40-year-old man presented with an asymptomatic tentorial DAVF on angiography. Transarterial embolization with Onyx was performed via the middle meningeal artery, and the cast filled the fistula itself and its proximal draining vein. Postoperative angiography confirmed complete occlusion of the DAVF. A computed tomography scan performed immediately after the procedure demonstrated an acute subdural hematoma with the temporal hemorrhage. Emergency craniotomy revealed continuous arterial bleeding from a viable glomus-like vascular structure around the proximal part of the embolized draining vein, fed by a pial artery arising from the posterior cerebral artery. Pathologic findings suggested diagnosis of vascular malformation extending into the subdural space. Tentorial DAVFs can extend to the subdural space along their drainage route, and may be involved in severe hemorrhagic complications of curative endovascular treatment using Onyx, particularly those with pial arterial supply."

    "abstract": "Due to the aging population, neurosurgeons are confronted with an increasing number of very old patients suffering from traumatic brain injury. Many of these patients present with an acute subdural hematoma. There is a lack of data on neurosurgical decision-making in elderly people. We investigated the importance of imaging criteria, patients' wishes, their surrogates' wishes, and patient demographics on treatment decisions chosen by neurosurgeons. An online questionnaire was sent to all German neurosurgical units via the German Society of Neurosurgery (DGNC). The survey was based on the reported case of an unconscious 81-year-old patient with an acute subdural hematoma and consisted of 13 questions. Of these questions, nine addressed indication and treatment plan and four evaluated the neurosurgeon's interest in gathering additional information on the patient's social environment and supposed patient's wishes or advance directive. Eighty-five percent of the interviewed neurosurgeons would perform an emergency operation in the presented case. Midline shift (84%), hematoma thickness (81%), and time between traumatic injury and treatment (81%) were considered to be the most important factors for surgical treatment. Gathering information on the social environment of the patient (66%) and discussion with family members (57%) were felt to be either unimportant. Neurosurgeons in Central Europe tend to treat acute subdural hematoma in very old patients based on imaging findings and according to mechanistic views. Social circumstances and patient wishes are considered to be less important. Education of the medical profession and the general public should aim to bring these factors into focus in the decision-making process."

    "abstract": "The outcome of severe acute subdural hematoma is unfavorable. In particular, patients with levels of consciousness of Glasgow Coma Scale(GCS)3 or 4 tend to be refractory to treatment. Decompressive craniotomy should be promptly performed to remove hematoma. However, if an operating room is not immediately available, emergency burr hole surgery is sometimes performed in the emergency room(primary care room)prior to craniotomy. A previous study has reported that the interval from injury to surgery influences the outcome of severe acute subdural hematoma. Therefore, emergency decompression is important to effectively treat patients with severe acute subdural hematoma. We present the cases of two patients with acute subdural hematomas. In both cases, emergency decompressive craniotomy(hematoma removal after craniotomy and external decompression)was performed in the emergency room of the Emergency and Critical Care Center. In both cases, the surgery was followed by favorable outcomes. Case 1 was a 36-year-old female. The patient's level of consciousness upon arrival was GCS 3. The interval from injury to diagnosis on the basis of CT findings was 75 minutes. Surgery began 20 minutes after diagnosis. Case 2 was a 25-year-old male. The second patient's level of consciousness upon arrival was GCS 4. The interval from injury to diagnosis on the basis of CT findings was 60 minutes. Surgery was begun 40 minutes after diagnosis. In both patients, we observed anisocoria and the loss of the light reflex. However, the postoperative course was favorable, and both patients were discharged. In summary, to treat severe acute subdural hematomas, early emergency decompressive craniotomy is optimal. Emergency decompressive surgery in the emergency room is independent of operating room or staff. Therefore, emergency decompressive craniotomy may improve the outcome of patients with severe acute subdural hematomas."

We experienced such a case and managed it successfully. A 6-year-old boy had severe head trauma caused by being hit by a car. He was transferred to our department and diagnosed as having left acute subdural hematoma and acute brain swelling. Emergent evacuation of hematoma and external decompression were performed. He was treated for severe brain swelling in the intensive care unit for 2 months. Cranioplasty was performed 3 months after the injury. His right hemiparesis and aphasia persisted, so he was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital. However, 2 years after the head injury, he was referred to our department because of abducens nerve palsy. He was diagnosed as having a symptomatic posttraumatic direct CCF, which was caused by a ruptured left cavernous giant internal carotid artery aneurysm. The direct CCF was treated with coil embolization of the giant aneurysm and parent artery occlusion. Coil embolization of the aneurysm and parent artery occlusion for the posttraumatic direct CCF was a good option to manage the abducens nerve palsy and to prevent postoperative hyperperfusion."

    "abstract": "A 4-year-old-boy required emergent craniectomy and drainage of a large right-sided acute subdural hematoma after head trauma, during which massive sinus hemorrhage with brain swelling occurred. Acute intraoperative management entailed dural cover using synthetic dural membrane substitute and scalp coverage over the herniated brain using acellular dermal matrix. After intensive monitoring and control of raised intracranial pressure over the next few days, the exposed brain was then covered by scalp and forehead flaps with cadaveric skin grafting to the donor site. This temporary coverage continued until adequate resolution of the intracranial swelling and control of the hydrocephalus using a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Ultimately, the flaps were derotated and the craniectomy site was reconstructed with autologous banked bone. The child had a significant functional recovery with some residual left-sided weakness. This case is the first report of local tissue flaps used for temporary coverage of malignant brain herniation in a pediatric head trauma patient and highlights their effective use. Through serial surgical procedures the brain was successfully covered without significant blood loss and the patient's local tissues returned to their original donor sites with good cosmetic outcome, without sacrifice of the patient's own skin or free flap options."

This retrospective study was performed on 99 patients who were operated for traumatic acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) without any systemic association at a single center. Epidural hematoma was reported to be the most common additional pathology. Age, sex, mechanism of trauma, time interval between onset of trauma and admission to the emergency ward, associated problems, thickness of hematoma and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score at the time of admission and on discharge were all studied. The GCS score was inversely proportional to the thickness of hematoma and interval between onset of trauma and surgery (p < 0.05). Although the mortality rate was reported to be high in traffic accidents, the rate was low in patients with head trauma only (p < 0.05). The mortality rate was high in patients with associated pathologies (p < 0.05). Lost patients were reported to be older patients with more extensive ASDH or those who presented earlier with a low GCS (p < 0.05). ASDH is associated with high mortality. GCS score and the thickness of the ASDH are important predictors of mortality. Age, additional trauma, and interval between trauma and hospital admission are major predictive factors for mortality."

The focus of this paper is to identify the subset of the population who are at risk, and determine whether they should be admitted for observation in the setting of mild traumatic brain injury. A 75-year-old woman taking daily aspirin (81 mg) had a fall with loss of consciousness. Her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 15 at the time of presentation to the emergency department. However, because of her postconcussive symptoms, computed tomography (CT) of the head was obtained, and the results were negative for any intracranial hemorrhage or fractures. She was admitted for workup. The next day, she neurologically deteriorated to a GCS score of 6. CT of the head was reobtained and showed acute, left-sided subdural hematoma with shift and herniation. She was taken to operating room for emergent decompressive craniotomy. Postoperatively, she developed left-sided temporal and occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage. She died after being placed on comfort care. Delayed acute subdural hematoma occurs mainly in the middle-aged or older population who are taking anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy. Most patients have a GCS score of 15 with no loss of consciousness. Neurological deterioration occurs within the first 24 hours for 70% of the patients. Therefore, we recommend admission and observation of these selected group of patients. Due to small reported population of patients, we could not determine whether the patients taking anticoagulant, antiplatelet, or both anticoagulant and antiplatelet medication are at higher risk. In addition, the role of delayed CT of the head without change in the examination result needs to be explored further."

In this retrospective study, 210 patients who underwent unilateral supratentorial acute SDH evacuation at a single hospital were included. Of these, 58 patients with remote hematomas other than SDH and 17 patients on warfarin or antiplatelet therapy were excluded. Patients with postoperative SDH development (n = 8) were compared with the control group (n = 127) to identify the risk factors of developing delayed contralateral SDH. We examined the patient demographics, coagulation test results (D-dimer, FDP, fibrinogen, PT and APTT), and radiological features (presence of skull fractures, presence of contusional hematomas, width of hematoma, and midline shift). The incidence and mortality for contralateral SDH were 4.1% and 75%, respectively. A significant association between fibrinogen (mg/dl) and delayed SDH were found (odds ratio, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.97 to 0.99, p = 0.02). Contralateral SDH development after acute SDH is infrequent and results in high mortality. Cautious observation and a low threshold for radiological evaluation are mandatory for improved patient outcome in patients with low fibrinogen."

A control CT was performed after 3 hours as somnolence continued in follow-up of the patient. Hematoma in the epidural region was observed to completely resolve and edema in the subgaleal region was observed to gain hemorrhagic characteristics. In total, 15 cases have been reported, including our case, in the literature with resolution less than 24 hours. Our case has the fourth fastest resolution ever reported in the English literature. We think that the most important factor in the rapid spontaneous resolution is the presence of a connection between the epidural and epicranial space, either through a fracture or cranial sutures."

CT angiogram demonstrated a long protruding ruptured aneurysm at the junction of the right internal carotid and posterior communicating arteries (IC/PC AN) with a posteroinferior projection, associated with a small bleb located near the tentorial edge close to the ipsilateral posterior clinoid process, for which she received clipping surgery. Though rare, IC/PC AN could cause pure or nearly pure ASDH in the above-mentioned distribution.

Emergency decompressive craniectomy was performed to remove the hematoma and during surgery a small (5 mm sized) conglomerated aciniform mass with two surrounding enlarged vessels was identified on the parietal cortex. After warm saline irrigation of the mass, active bleeding developed from a one of the vessel. The bleeding was stopped by coagulation and the vessels were removed. Histopathological examination confirmed the lesion as an AVM. We concluded that a small cortical AVM existed at this area, and that the cortical AVM had caused the acute SDH. Follow up conventional angiography confirmed the absence of remnant AVM or any other vascular abnormality. This report demonstrates rupture of a cortical AVM is worth considering when a patient presents with non-traumatic SDH without intracerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage."

    "title": "Temporal delays in trauma craniotomies.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE The Brain Trauma Foundation recommendation regarding the timing of surgical evacuation of epidural hematomas and subdural hematomas is to perform the procedure as soon as possible. Indeed, faster evacuation is associated with better outcome. However, to the authors' knowledge, no study has looked at where delays in intrahospital care occurred for patients suffering from traumatic intracranial mass lesions. The goals of this study were as follows: 1) to characterize the performance of a Level 1 trauma center in terms of delays for emergency trauma craniotomies, 2) to review step by step where delays occurred in patient care, and 3) to propose ways to improve performance. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted covering a 5-year period of all emergency trauma craniotomies. Demographic data, injury severity, neurological status, and functional outcome data were collected. The time elapsed between emergency department (ED) arrival and CT imaging, between CT imaging and arrival at the operating room (OR), between ED arrival and OR arrival, between OR arrival and skin incision, and between ED arrival and skin incision were calculated. Patients were also subcategorized as either having immediate life-threatening emergencies (E0) or life-threatening emergencies (E1). The operative technique was also reviewed (standard craniotomy opening vs immediate bur hole decompression followed by craniotomy). RESULTS The study included 166 patients. Of these, 58 (35%) were classified into the E0 group and 108 (64.2%) into the E1 group. The median ED-to-CT delay was 54 minutes with no significant difference between the E0 and the E1 groups. The median CT-to-OR time delay was 57 minutes. The median delay for the E0 group was 39 minutes and that for the E1 group was 70 minutes (p = 0.002). The median delay from ED to OR arrival for patients with a CT scanning done at an outside hospital was 75 minutes. The median delay from ED to OR arrival was 85 minutes for the E0 group and 127 minutes for the E1 group (p < 0.0001). The median delay from OR arrival to skin incision was 35 minutes (E0: median 27 minutes; E1: median 39 minutes; p < 0.0001). The median total time elapsed between ED arrival and skin incision was 150 minutes (E0: median 131 minutes; E1: median 180 minutes). Overall, only 17% of patients underwent immediate bur hole decompression, but the proportion climbed to 41% in the E0 group. A lower Glasgow Coma Scale score was associated with a shorter delay (p = 0.0004). CONCLUSIONS A long delay until surgery still exists for patients requiring urgent mass lesion evacuation. Many factors contribute to this delay, including performing imaging and transfer to and preparation in the OR. Strategies can be implemented to reduce delays and improve the delivery of care."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous rapid resolution of acute subdural hematoma developing secondary to trauma has been reported in the literature, yet it is very rare in pediatric population. The aim of the present review is to analyze mechanisms, characteristics, and outcomes of pediatric acute subdural hematoma cases with spontaneous rapid resolution in conjunction with an exemplary case of ours. A 3-year-old boy was admitted to our emergency department following mild head trauma secondary to a fall from 2 m. He was alert and has a GCS of 15. He had no motor or sensorial deficit on neurological examination. On the emergent brain computed tomography image, an acute subdural hematoma over left frontoparietal lobe was observed. There was a midline shift of 8.3 mm and the width of the hematoma at the thickest portion was 11.2 mm. Surgery was postponed with a close neurological follow-up of the patient in pediatric intensive care unit, due to his well neurological status without any increased ICP findings. On the fourth hour follow-up head CT image, amount of midline shift and hematoma thickness were observed to have regressed dramatically. At the second week, the hematoma resorbed totally with only conservative approach, and he was discharged to home in well status. Analysis of 12 pediatric patients revealed a mean and median ages of 6.87 and 3.9 years, respectively (range = 8 months-18 years). Causes for ASH development were fall, traffic accident, struggle, and child abuse. Main clinical presentations were with depressed sensorium, coma, stupor, drowsiness, headache, motor weakness, lethargy, and seizure. Close follow-up with conservative treatment should be mode of approach in pediatric patients with ASH, if neurological and radiological findings are favorable. However, if patients' neurological status deteriorates after admission to hospital, surgery should be conveyed with no further delay."

    "abstract": "It is not common for an acute subdural hematoma (SDH) in the supratentorial region to show rapid resolution or migration during the clinical course. In this report, we present a rare case where the SDH in the supratentorial region was observed to rapidly migrate into the lumbar spinal canal, leading to severe radiculopathy. A 20-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency department with severe headache after head trauma. The patient's overall condition was good, whereas his Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15 and blood pressure was normal. He had vomited 3 times after the onset of pain. No stiff neck was found, and the computed tomography showed an ASDH over the outer layer of the right hemisphere, causing a 7- to 8-mm shift. During the follow-up, the headache regressed and eventually resolved after 12 hours; however, another severe pain occurred in the lumbar region and in both legs. The pain worsened over time, progressing to sciatica in both legs. Acute SDH associated with a minor head trauma may migrate from the supratentorial compartment into the spinal canal by the help of elastic cerebral tissues in young adults and children."

    "abstract": "Craniotomy is frequently used for the treatment of acute subdural hematoma; however, it the procedure exhibits a high mortality rate. Preoperative trepanation and drainage in an emergency ward may reduce intracranial pressure, shorten operation time and lower patient mortality, and is thus applicable to the treatment of acute subdural hematoma. The present study reports the cases of two elderly patients that benefitted from trepanation and drainage of an acute subdural hematoma. In each case, the family members of the patients refused to consent to a craniotomy; thus, burr-hole drainage was selected as an alternative option for relieving intracranial pressure. The risks require careful evaluation when considering whether trepanation with drainage is an option for a patient. Following treatment, the two cases were cured and discharged on days 48 and 18 after admission, respectively. The present case studies indicate that trepanation with drainage may be a promising approach for reducing craniotomy-associated mortality and closely monitoring condition variation in elderly patients. Following trepanation with drainage, certain patients do not undergo a craniotomy."

Significant intracranial head trauma from a fall or birth injury is not common in the immediate newborn period. Furthermore, intracranial bleeding requiring surgical intervention is exceedingly rare. We present an unusual case of an in-hospital fall in the delivery room requiring neurosurgical intervention. A term infant, appropriate for gestational age, delivered precipitously from a maternal standing position. The vertex neonate struck the linoleum floor after an approximate 80-cm fall, landing headfirst. The physical and neurological exams were initially normal, and skull films did not demonstrate an obvious fracture. The baby was closely observed, undergoing continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring. After the patient had an episode of apnea, a scalp hematoma was noted. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a left parietal fracture with an acute epidural hematoma, which required emergent craniotomy. The infant had an unremarkable post-operative course and had a normal neurodevelopmental assessment at 15 months of age. Close, continuous observation is recommended for infants following an in-hospital fall or after significant birth trauma. A high degree of suspicion for intracranial hemorrhage must be maintained. Fall prevention strategies should focus on careful baby handling by the convalescing mother."

To describe 1) selected epidemiological and clinical characteristics of persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI) who died within 24 h after admission to the emergency departments (EDs) of two medical facilities in rural India and 2) the methods used to transport these patients from the locale of the injury incident to the study sites. Medical records of all injured patients regardless of age or sex who died within 24 h after admission to both EDs during January 31, 2007 through December 31, 2009 were reviewed and abstracted. Demographic variables and information on prehospital care, time and mechanism of injury, mode of transport to EDs, and primary hospital resuscitation were abstracted and analyzed. Of the 113 injured patients in this study, 42 had TBI and died within 24 h of ED admission. All of these TBI patients were transported to the ED by relatives or bystanders in non-ambulance vehicles. Most of the patients with TBI (78.5%) were 21-50-years-old; and overall 90.0% were males. Persons working near or along busy roads struck by vehicles accounted for 80.9% of all TBI cases. Severe TBIs were present in 97.6% of the patients; of these, 92.8% had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3 on arrival. Other concurrent injuries included superficial lacerations (85.7%), facial injuries (57.1%), and upper (35.7%) and lower (30.9%) extremity fractures. Common lesions recognized on computed tomography (CT) scan were acute subdural hematoma (21.4%), subarachnoid hemorrhage with diffuse cerebral edema (16.6%), and skull base fracture with diffuse cerebral edema (14.2%); in 21.4% of cases, the CT scan were reported normal. Most of the TBI patients who died within 24 h after admission to EDs in this study were not transported to EDs in emergency medical vehicles; most were of working age (ages 20-50 years); were male; and were day laborers working on busy interstate roads where they were hit by vehicles."

However her consciousness did not recover well. Emergent computed tomography demonstrated a right acute supratentorial subdural hematoma with impending cerebral herniation. Emergent craniotomy revealed hemorrhage from the vein of Labbé. It may have been caused by acute intracranial hypotension secondary to rapid and massive drainage of cerebrospinal fluid.

    "abstract": "Severe traumatic brain injury is a major public health problem that accounts for one-third of all deaths due to trauma in the United States. This case report illustrates some of the challenges faced by the elderly in accessing essential emergency services for traumatic brain injury. A 74-year-old Caucasian man presented with head trauma at his local acute care hospital (level III/IV) in Canada at 2:30 PM. He was triaged at 4:00 PM and was seen by the emergency room physician at 4:50 PM. His vital signs were normal, and his Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15/15 upon admission. A computed tomography-based diagnosis of acute subdural hematoma was subsequently made by a radiologist at 5:00 PM. A neurosurgical transfer was requested to the nearby tertiary trauma center (level I/II), but was initially refused by the neurosurgical resident on call. The patient's condition slowly deteriorated until he became unconscious at 7:45 PM. The patient was intubated and transferred to the neurosurgical unit at 8:34 PM. He was seen by a consultant neurosurgeon at 9:30 PM, but surgery (craniotomy) was deemed not viable, given the patient's age and the fact that his pupils were now fixed and dilated (Glasgow Coma Scale score 3/15). The patient was taken off life support at 1:00 AM the following morning and died shortly thereafter. The patient's family made a formal complaint, but the decision by an independent medical review panel was that \"the patient's care was prudent, timely and professional.\" Geriatric patients with severe head injury are less likely than their younger counterparts to be transferred to neurosurgical trauma centers. Protocol-driven care of the elderly can reduce mortality due to head trauma through the application of the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines."

The mechanism of encapsulated ASDH has been studied but not completely clarified. Encapsulated lentiform ASDH on a computed tomography (CT) scan mimics acute epidural hematoma (AEDH). Misinterpretation of biconvex-shaped ASDH on CT scan as AEDH often occurs and is usually identified by neurosurgical intervention. We report a case of an 85-year-old man presenting with a 2-day history of mental deterioration and right-sided weakness. CT scan revealed a biconvex-shaped hyperdense mass mixed with various densities of blood along the left temporoparietal cerebral convexity, which was misinterpreted as AEDH preoperatively. Emergency craniectomy was performed, but no AEDH was found beneath the skull. In the subdural space, encapsulated ASDH was located. En block resection of encapsulated ASDH was done. Emergency craniectomy confirmed that the preoperatively diagnosed AEDH was an encapsulated ASDH postoperatively. Radiologic studies of AEDH-like SDH allow us to establish an easy differential diagnosis between AEDH and ASDH by distinct features. More histological studies will provide us information on the mechanism underlying encapsulated ASDH."

    "abstract": "The infantile skull is malleable, and its sutures are tightly adhering to the underlying dura and venous sinus. These characteristics, in association with the small amount of total blood volume, can result in a specific fatal type of skull fracture, which is unique to infancy. The authors report a case of this injury, and stress the need to pay attention to the possibility of massive bleeding during operation in infants. A 23-month-old female baby presented with semicomatose mentality after sustaining injuries by falling from a second-floor. Plain skull films showed bi-frontal skull fracture crossing the midline. Computed tomography revealed an acute subdural hematoma along the right convexity with severe brain edema. In the emergency operation, the scalp incision exposed massive bleeding from the fracture site. The bleeding was identified as arising from the lacerated and widely separated sagittal sinus beneath the fracture. The patient entered hypovolemic shock immediately after the scalp incision, and died from severe brain edema two days after the trauma and surgery. This case implies that special care should be paid during the operation of patients that have skull fracture overlying the venous sinus, especially when the fracture line is separated."

In terms of haemorrhage, subdural haematomas are usually more frequent lesions than epidural hematomas, which, more rarely, may also be seen after ventricular shunt procedures and may lead to rapid neurological decline and even death unless a surgical procedure can be promptly performed. This study reports the case of a 47 years-old Dandy Walker man, with clinical condition compatible with the diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus submitted to a ventriculoperitoneal shunt with a high fixed pressure valve. After discharge, on the second day after the procedure, he presented with headache and impaired level of consciousness. At hospital admission he was in a coma and anisochoric. Underwent endotracheal intubation and a head CT, showed epidural hematoma. We performed emergency craniotomy to drain the hematoma, the patient died in the operating room despite resuscitation attempts. In conclusion, prompt diagnosis and emergency craniotomy is recommended in these cases. We must be aware of this possible evolution and maintain high suspicion besides a longer in-hospital observation after these procedures."

    "abstract": "Although the pre-surgical management of patients with acute traumatic subdural hematoma prioritizes rapid transport to the operating room, there is conflicting evidence regarding the importance of time interval from injury to surgery with regards to outcomes. We sought to determine the association of surgical timing with outcomes for subdural hematoma. A retrospective review was performed of 522 consecutive patients admitted to a single center from 2006-2012 who underwent emergent craniectomy for acute subdural hematoma. After excluding patients with unknown time of injury, penetrating trauma, concurrent cerebrovascular injury, epidural hematoma, or intraparenchymal hemorrhage greater than 30 mL, there remained 45 patients identified for analysis. Using a multiple regression model, we examined the effect of surgical timing, in addition to other variables on in-hospital mortality (primary outcome), as well as the need for tracheostomy or gastrostomy (secondary outcome). We found that increasing injury severity score (odds ratio [OR] 1.146; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.035-1.270; p=0.009) and age (OR1.066; 95%CI 1.006-1.129; p=0.031) were associated with in-hospital mortality in multivariate analysis. In this model, increasing time to surgery was not associated with mortality, and in fact had a significant effect in decreasing mortality (OR 0.984; 95%CI 0.971-0.997; p=0.018). Premorbid aspirin use was associated with a paradoxical decrease in mortality (OR 0.019; 95%CI 0.001-0.392; p=0.010). In this patient sample, shorter time interval from injury to surgery was not associated with better outcomes. While there are potential confounding factors, these findings support the evaluation of rigorous preoperative resuscitation as a priority in future study."

Eleven patients admitted to our emergency unit with small acute epidural hematoma were prospectively studied. All patients with temporal acute epidural hematomas underwent CTA and cerebral angiogram at our institution for diagnosis of posttraumatic lesions of middle meningeal artery. The findings of angiotomography and digital angiography were reviewed by radiologist and angiographers, respectively, to ensure that the lesions were readily diagnosed without knowing the results of angiotomography and to compare CTA findings with standard angiogram. The causes of head injury were traffic accidents, falls, and aggression. Three of these patients presented traumatic MMA pseudoaneurysm. CT angiography was able to diagnose all of them, with dimensions ranging from 1.5 to 2.8 mm. Conventional angiography confirmed the findings of CT angiography, and the lesions presented with similar dimensions at both methods. We believe that angiotomography can be a useful technique for diagnosis of vascular lesion associated with small epidural hematoma."

After the operation, the patient recovered all motor and senses. As there was CSF leakage in the postoperative wound, this was confirmed by cervical spinal computed tomography (CT). Then lumbar drainage was thus performed. The opening pressure upon lumbar puncture was not measured as it was very low. As a result of continous CSF leakage, dural repair was performed. After the operation, the patient had been discharged without neurologic deficits. In this case, it is sensible to suspect intracranial hypotension as a possible cause of spinal EDH."

This study aimed to investigate the effects of yokukansan on destructive and aggressive behaviors in patients after traumatic brain injury. From April 2008 to July 2010, 189 patients who suffered traumatic brain injury were admitted to our tertiary emergency center. Of these, patients with destructive and aggressive behaviors were treated with neuroleptics. Seven patients (five men and two women) who could not be controlled by neuroleptics were given yokukansan (2.5 g powder) three times a day before meals. Main underlying conditions included brain contusion in three patients, acute subdural hematoma in two, and acute epidural hematoma in two. The following assessments were carried out at baseline and 1 and 2 weeks after initiation of treatment: the Glasgow Coma Scale for the assessment of disturbed consciousness after traumatic brain injury; Neuropsychiatric Inventory for the distress of medical staff; Mini-Mental State Examination for cognitive function; Barthel Index for activities of daily living; Vitality Index for motivation; presence of adverse effects and drug interactions.

The cranial CT scan demonstrated a left fronto-parietal acute epidural hematoma (AEH) and a calvarial bone expansion, which was suggestive of medullary hematopoiesis. The patient underwent emergent craniotomy and evacuation of the hematoma. There were no abnormal findings intra-operatively apart from the AEH, except skull thickening and active petechial bleeding from the dural arteries. Repeated CT scan showed a complete evacuation of the hematoma. The possible underlying pathophysiological mechanisms were discussed. In addition to the factors mentioned in the relevant literature, any active petechial bleeding from the dural arteries on the separated surface of the dura from the skull could have contributed to the expanding of the AEH in our patient. Neurosurgeons and other health care providers should be aware of spontaneous AEH in patients with SCD."

    "abstract": "Mild traumatic brain injuries, if repeated, can cause permanent brain damage, or even death. I examined five published documents(three judicial decisions, one official injury report, and one book)to analyze incidents in which high school students who, while practicing judo, experienced acute subdural hematoma(ASDH)with grave outcomes, despite the fact that they had been examined by neurosurgeons. The five students, first-grade boy and girl of junior high school and two first-grade boys and one second-grade girl of senior high school, were hit on the head during extracurricular judo practice and were taken to the neurosurgery department of different hospitals. They were all novices or unskilled players. The initial diagnoses were ASDH in three cases, concussion in one, and headache in one. Although the surgeons, except in one case, prohibited the students from returning to play, the juveniles resumed judo practice soon. Some of them complained of continued headaches, but they kept practicing. Between 17 and 82 days after the first injury, they received the fateful hits to their heads, and they were brought to the emergency rooms. MRI and CT revealed ASDH in all;two of them died, and the other three remain in persistent vegetative state. Neurosurgeons should take the initiative to prevent severe brain injury of young athletes through collaborations with the athletes themselves, fellow athletes, family members, coaches, teachers, athletic directors, and other physicians. They should pay close attention to headaches and other signs and symptoms of concussion and prohibit the athletes from returning to play until they are confirmed to be symptom free for recommended periods, insisting that safety comes first."

    "abstract": "Acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) usually requires emergency surgical decompression, but rare cases exhibit rapid spontaneous resolution. The aim of this retrospective study was to identify factors predictive of spontaneous ASDH resolution. A total of 366 consecutive patients with ASDH treated between January 2006 and September 2012 were identified in our hospital database. Patients with ASDH clot thickness >10mm in the frontoparietotemporal region and showing a midline shift >10mm on the initial computed tomography (CT) scan were divided into two groups according to subsequent spontaneous resolution. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors predictive of rapid spontaneous ASDH resolution. Fifty-six ASDH patients met study criteria and 18 demonstrated rapid spontaneous resolution (32%). Majority of these patients were not operated because of poor prognosis/condition and in accordance to family wishes. Univariate analysis revealed significant differences in use of antiplatelet agents before head injury and in the incidence of a low-density band between the hematoma and inner wall of the skull bone on the initial CT. Use of antiplatelet agents before head injury (OR 19.6, 95% CI 1.5-260.1, p=0.02) and the low-density band on CT images (OR 40.3, 95% CI 3.1-520.2, p=0.005) were identified as independent predictive factors by multivariate analysis. Our analysis suggested that use of antiplatelet agents before head injury and a low-density band between the hematoma and inner skull bone on CT images (indicative of cerebrospinal fluid infusion into the subdural space) increase the probability of rapid spontaneous resolution."

    "title": "Treatment of acute subdural hematoma.",
    "abstract": "Clinical presentation, neurologic condition, and imaging findings are the key components in establishing a treatment plan for acute SDH. Location and size of the SDH and presence of midline shift can rapidly be determined by computed tomography of the head. Immediate laboratory work up must include PT, PTT, INR, and platelet count. Presence of a coagulopathy or bleeding diathesis requires immediate reversal and treatment with the appropriate agent(s), in order to lessen the risk of hematoma expansion. Reversal protocols used are similar to those for intracerebral hemorrhage, with institutional variations. Immediate neurosurgical evaluation is sought in order to determine whether the SDH warrants surgical evacuation. Urgent or emergent surgical evacuation of a SDH is largely influenced by neurologic examination, imaging characteristics, and presence of mass effect or elevated intracranial pressure. Generally, evacuation of an acute SDH is recommended if the clot thickness exceeds 10 mm or the midline shift is greater than 5 mm, regardless of the neurologic condition. In patients with patients with an acute SDH with clot thickness <10 mm and midline shift <5 mm, specific considerations of neurologic findings and clinical circumstances will be of importance. In addition, consideration will be given as to whether an individual patient is likely to benefit from surgery. For an acute SDH, evacuation by craniotomy or craniectomy is preferred over burr holes based on available data. Postoperative care includes monitoring of resolution of pneumocephalus, mobilization and drain removal, and monitoring for signs of SDH reaccumulation. Medical considerations include seizure prophylaxis and management as well as management and resumption of antithrombotic and anticoagulant medication."

We describe a case of a 48-year-old right-handed woman found comatose brought by emergency medical services to an outside hospital. A non-contrast head CT scan demonstrated bilateral acute SDHs without evidence of intraparenchymal or subarachnoid hemorrhage. A CT angiogram of the head showed a focal hyperdensity in the distal left internal carotid artery (ICA) and was confirmed by conventional cerebral angiography to be a 7-mm left supraclinoid ICA aneurysm. On repeat CT scan a new hemorrhage was seen in the sphenoid sinus indicating a re-bleeding. The aneurysm was treated with coil embolization and complete occlusion was confirmed with subsequent angiograms. The patient had an eventful hospital course complicated by a Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and pulmonary edema. She was medically treated with successful recovery of her cardiopulmonary function. She remained markedly disabled and was transferred to an inpatient rehabilitation center for continued convalescence. Acute subdural hematoma may be due to a ruptured clinoid carotid aneurysm. Acute hemorrhage into the sphenoid sinus can be an important clue."

Generally, resolution of the hemorrhage requires weeks and months in patients treated conservatively. However, numerous cases of rapid spontaneous resolution of ASDH, occurring within 72h after the trauma, have been reported to date in the literature. Several possible hypotheses have been suggested, primarily involving redistribution and dilution, or washing out the ASDH. In this study, we present the relevant images of such a case, review the mechanisms of the rapid spontaneous resolution in the literature, and also propose a new hypothesis to explain the occurrence of the rapid spontaneous resolution of ASDH.

To reduce the fatality of conventional procedures and to evacuate acute subdural hematoma with severe brain edema by a combination of decompressive craniotomy and multi-dural stabs (SKIMS-Technique) without brain pouting and lacerations in low Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score patients. The prospective study was conducted in the Department of Neurosurgery, from June, 2006 to June 2011, under a uniform protocol. A total of 225 patients of severe brain trauma were admitted to the accident and emergency unit of Neurosurgery and after initial resuscitation a CT brain was performed. All patients had a GCS score of 8 and below. All patients were ventilated postoperatively and ICP was monitored. The data was analyzed and evaluated by the statistical methods like student's T-test. The analysis of Variance was used where-ever applicable. The survival of multi-dural stab group was 77.31% (92/119) with good recovery in 42.02% (50/119) and a mortality of 22.69% (27/119) as compared with 46.23% (49/106) survival in open dural flap (control) group with 15.09% (16/106) good recovery and mortality of 53.77% (57/106).

To evaluate the incidence and risk factors leading to the development of a contralateral extraaxial hematoma and to describe the characteristics of cases. A retrospective cohort study with prospective data collection was undertaken. All patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) from 2006 to 2010 were studied. The inclusion criteria were as follows: severe trauma [Injury Severity Score (ISS ≥ 16)], neurosurgery (NeuroSx) in the first 24 h. The following were excluded: subacute/chronic subdural hematomas, first bilateral NeuroSx. Cases were those who required immediate contralateral NeuroSx after the first NeuroSx due to the occurrence of a new extraaxial injury or significant growth of a previous one. Controls were those patients those who did not require second NeuroSx or who required reoperation due to ipsilateral lesions. The variables considered were: demographics, neurological assessment, traumatic injuries and severity, image and surgical findings, clinical course, and outcome. Statistics analysis comprised descriptive, inferential, and multivariate analysis by logistic regression. A total of 120 patients were included, among which there were 11 cases (incidence 9.2 %). The cases showed a significantly higher frequency of coma or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) at admission, contralateral injury and contralateral skull fracture in the preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan, as well as decompressive craniectomy. There were no significant differences in the severity scores, clinical course, or outcomes. The presence of contralateral fracture was identified as an independent risk factor [relative risk (RR) 47.9, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 5.2-443]. Contralateral extraaxial hematoma is a rare entity, although it has a high mortality rate. Therefore, it requires a high index of suspicion, especially in patients with severe TBI, with minimal contralateral injury and mainly with contralateral skull fracture on the initial CT scan."

A 7-year-old Asian girl with traumatic acute subdural hematoma was transferred to our hospital for an emergency operation based on the results of an initial computed tomography scan and neurological examination. However, a repeat computed tomography scan two hours after trauma disclosed considerable reduction of the hematoma and midline shift with neurological improvements. Serial follow-up imaging studies demonstrated apparent redistribution of the hematoma over the cerebellar tentorium, posterior interhemispheric fissure and subarachnoid space. The patient was discharged with mild confusion 40 days after the admission. A follow-up computed tomography scan is strongly recommended before surgery when a child with a severe head injury presents with any sign of neurological improvement, especially with a mixed density hematoma on the initial computed tomography scan."

Continuous subcutaneous administration of treprostinil has been proven in randomized controlled trials to improve quality of life, hemodynamics, and 5-year survival in patients with PAH. The efficacy of treprostinil has been attributed to its vasodilatory and antiplatelet effects. Unfortunately, the efficacy of treprostinil in the treatment of PAH is rapidly reversed upon cessation of the continuous infusion. Furthermore, cases of patients rapidly declining or succumbing to disease progression upon cessation of treprostinil have raised significant concern regarding discontinuation of this medication. To date, there are no reports of emergency craniotomies performed in the setting of continuous subcutaneous infusion of treprostinil. The authors report a case of a patient with PAH, treated with continuous administration of subcutaneous treprostinil as well as warfarin, who developed an acute subdural hematoma (SDH). Despite adequate INR (international normalized ratio) correction, the patient eventually underwent an emergency craniotomy for evacuation of the SDH while on continuous treprostinil administration. This case highlights the neurosurgical dilemma regarding the appropriate management of acute SDHs in patients receiving continuous treprostinil infusion."

We describe a patient with a rapid spontaneous decrease in the volume of a large hematoma. A 73-year-old man presented semi-comatose mentality. Initial brain computed tomography (CT) revealed the huge sICH. An emergency operation was planned, but was not performed due to the refusal of patient's family. Therefore, we decided to treat with conservative therapy. However, follow-up brain CT 16 hours after initial scan showed a remarkable reduction of previous sICH. The mechanism involving the spontaneous rapid decrease of the hematoma is presumed to occur through redistribution in brain atrophy, compression effect from the increased intracranial pressure and dilution through a wash out by the cerebrospinal fluid."

Computed tomography revealed a high density lentiform lesion in the right convexity, which was thought to be acute epidural hematoma preoperatively. Emergent decompressive craniotomy revealed an encapsulated solid fresh clot in the subdural space and a bleeding small cortical artery under the clot. The arachnoid membrane and the brain parenchyma were intact, and no other abnormal feature such as aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation was observed. The encapsulated ASDH was removed en bloc and the patient fully recovered. Histological examination confirmed that both the outer thicker and the inner membrane were fibrinous single structures without vasculature. The red blood cells constituting the clot in the capsule maintained their cell structure. The reported pathological mechanisms of lentiform ASDH are adhesion of the arachnoid membrane and the dura mater or intracapsular bleeding from sinusoidal vessels in the outer membrane of the chronic subdural hematoma. However, in our case, the arachnoid membrane had not adhered to the dura mater and the capsule was a fibrinous single structural membrane without vasculature, which probably resulted from a previous hematoma due to initial bleeding from the cortical artery. The possible mechanism in our case was that the re-bleeding dissected and flowed into the fibrinous single structural membrane, resulting in formation of the lentiform ASDH."

A whole-body computed tomography was the diagnostic method employed in all cases. Both lesions were observed simultaneously in 69 cases (19.4%), predominantly in males (57 individuals, 82.6%). Cranial injuries included epidural hematoma, acute subdural hematoma, brain contusion, ventricular hemorrhage and traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. The transverse processes were the most fragile portion of the vertebrae and were more susceptible to fractures. The seventh cervical vertebra was the most commonly affected segment, with 24 cases (34.78%). The distribution of fractures was similar among the other cervical vertebrae, the first four thoracic vertebrae and the lumbar spine. Neurological deficit secondary to SI was detected in eight individuals (11.59%) and two individuals (2.89%) died. Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage was the most common intracranial finding (82.6%).

Thirty cases of severe head injuries suffered during Judo practice were enrolled in this study. They have made insurance claims for damage compensation and inquiries about Judo accidents attributed to the All Japan Judo Federation, from 2003 to 2010. The average age of the patients was 16.5 year old. The incidence of injury showed 2 peaks in different academic grade levels; one is in the first year of junior high-school (30.0%, n=9) and the other is in senior high school (26.7%, n=8). Around half of them were beginners. Four cases (13.3%) had past history of head trauma or headache and dizziness before a catastrophic accident, suggesting the presence of a second impact. Lucid interval was observed in 25 cases (83.3%). Most patients (93.3%) suffered acute subdural hematoma associated with avulsion of a cerebral bridging vein. Of patients who underwent emergency removal of the hematoma, 15 patients (50%) died and 7 patients (23.3%) entered a persistent vegetative state. Based on these findings, we propose an emergency manual with safety measures for effectively preventing and treating Judo head injuries in an appropriate manner. To reduce the disastrous head injuries in Judo, the safety measures and an optimal action manual should be reconsidered and widely spread and accepted by society."

If the patient can tolerate stimulation with a minor displacement, the electrodes should be left in position and the stimulation parameter needs to be adjusted. If not, the stimulation electrodes should be deactivated or repositioned appropriately, depending on the patient's conditions."

    "abstract": "Acute epidural hematomas present a serious and urgent condition. Standard management is early diagnosis and immediate surgical evacuation. Otherwise, there is a high risk of quick deterioration and death. Only patients with small asymptomatic epidural hematomas can be managed conservatively with close observation. We present a case of traumatic right temporal epidural hematoma. This is one of the rare cases of rapid spontaneous resolution of epidural hematomas within hours. Various possible mechanisms to explain the rapid resolution are discussed together with a review of the literature regarding the conservative treatment of epidural hematoma."

    "abstract": "Acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) is a life-threatening injury with a high mortality rate. Most ASDH cases are a result of trauma; nontraumatic causes are relatively rare with an incidence rate of 3% to 5%. We report an unusual series of 2 patients, identical twins, who had nontraumatic subdural hematomas 1 year apart, one at age 15 and the other at age 16. METHODS (CASE PRESENTATIONS): Identical twin brothers presented 1 year and 10 days apart to an academic medical center after incurring confusion, decreased mental functioning, and a subsequent comatose state. The injuries occurred while the patients were playing football, but there was no evidence of traumatic blow to the head in either brother. Both patients had computed tomographic scans and both underwent emergency surgery for hematoma evacuation. Both patients recovered full neurological function and remained healthy 12 years after surgery. Acute spontaneous subdural hematoma is an emergent medical condition that may result in rapid neurological decline and must be addressed in a timely fashion. After evacuation of the hematoma, intracranial pressure decreases and cerebral perfusion pressure increases, which may allow normal perfusion of the brain. Consequently, prompt recognition and evacuation of an ASDH can drastically improve prognosis. Rarely, subdural hematoma can occur without head injury and should be in the differential diagnosis of athletes who rapidly become comatose."

    "title": "Temporizing treatment of hyperacute subdural hemorrhage by subdural evacuation port system placement.",
    "abstract": "An acute subdural hematoma (SDH) requiring surgical intervention is treated with craniotomy or craniectomy, in part because it is generally accepted that coagulated blood present in the acute phase cannot be adequately evacuated by less-invasive means such as bur hole drainage. However, a hyperacute SDH in the first few hours after trauma can have mixed-density components on CT scans that are thought to represent subdural blood that is not yet fully coagulated. The authors report a case in which a hyperacute SDH in a patient receiving antiplatelet therapy was treated with the novel technique of temporizing subdural evacuation port system (SEPS) placement. Placement of an SEPS in the intensive care unit allowed for rapid surgical treatment of the patient's elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) by drainage of 70 ml of fresh subdural blood. After initial SEPS-induced stabilization, the patient underwent operative treatment of the SDH by craniotomy. The combined approach of emergency SEPS placement followed by craniotomy resulted in a dramatic recovery, with improvement from coma and extensor posturing to a normal status on neurological evaluation 5 weeks later. In appropriately selected cases, patients with a hyperacute SDH may benefit from SEPS placement to quickly treat elevated ICP, as a bridge to definitive surgical treatment by craniotomy."

    "abstract": "A previously healthy 68-year-old woman presented with a rare case of subdural empyema which developed at the site of preceding acute subdural hematoma (SDH). She was first admitted for treatment of an acute SDH after a fall. Since she was neurologically intact and the SDH volume decreased with conservative management, she was discharged 9 days after admission for follow up as an outpatient. Three days after discharge, she unexpectedly returned with worsening headache and altered mental status. Brain computed tomography (CT) showed increased SDH volume. Her condition deteriorated rapidly after presentation, with further increase in SDH volume. Copious pus in addition to the SDH was evacuated by emergency drainage, establishing the diagnosis of subdural empyema. Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified from bacterial cultures. Despite improvement in postoperative CT findings, she fell into septic shock and died 3 days after the drainage. Autopsy revealed meningitis and lobar pneumonia, and the postmortem diagnosis was invasive pneumococcal disease. Infection of acute SDH resulting in subdural empyema by S. pneumoniae is extremely rare. However, invasive pneumococcal disease is not uncommon in the elderly and tends to cause intracranial bleeding. Considering the high mortality rate of invasive pneumococcal disease and the low vaccination rate among the elderly in Japan, neurosurgeons should ask about the pneumococcal vaccination status."

The nontraumatic cranial epidural hematoma is an extremely rare clinical entity and it commonly occurs in the presence of infectious diseases as complication of sinusitis, coagulopathy, vascular malformation of the dura, hemorrhagic tumor, in patients with sickle cell disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, after open heart surgery, and in patients on hemodialysis. We reported a case of spontaneous epidural hematoma that occurred after herniated disc surgery. There was no history of preceding head trauma and patient medical history was unremarkable. To date, no report is found of cranial epidural hematoma after lumbar discectomy. A 58-year-old woman was operated because of a herniated disc at lumbar L3-L4 level and spinal stenosis. Bilateral L3-L4 interlaminectomies and L3-L4 discectomy were performed. Hemovac drain was placed in epidural space. Four hours after surgery, the patient developed left side weakness accompanied with nausea, vomiting, and severe headache. Urgent computed tomography of the head showed acute cranial epidural hematoma and the patient underwent emergent surgery. There was no evidence of trauma of the scalp or any other anatomical abnormality. Control computed tomography 14 hours after evacuation of the hematoma showed new extradural hematoma at the site of the previous one. Patient underwent second surgery. Nine days after operation of the spine, patient recovered completely with no neurological deficit, but the cerebrospinal fluid showed at the place of spinal wound. Patient was operated once more and a minor dural tear was revealed, which was repaired. The patient was discharged on ninth postoperative and she recovered completely. There have been described rare cases of spontaneous subdural, intracerebral, and intracerebellar hematoma caused by intracranial hypotension, but this is the first described case of spontaneous cranial epidural hematoma after lumbar disc surgery caused by intracranial hypotension."

    "abstract": "Acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) is a critical condition following the onset of traumatic brain injury, and it is essential to immediately reduce elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Single burr hole surgery/twist drill craniostomy is commonly performed in patients with ASDH as an emergency surgical intervention, usually preceding decompressive craniotomy. A novel method using a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage catheter kit for rapid drainage of ASDH is described. Percutaneous twist drill craniostomy using a CAMINO(®) micro ventricular bolt pressure-temperature monitoring kit was performed in the emergency room in 12 patients with severe ASDH. The kit contained a closed-system CSF drainage and pressure-temperature monitoring catheter, which allowed aspiration of the hematoma and monitoring of the ICP. The tip of the catheter was inserted into the hematoma from the forehead. The mean initial ICP was 61 mmHg, with a range of 31 to 120 mmHg. The liquid hematoma was aspirated, and the ICP was temporarily controlled to the normal range. Pupil dilation recovered immediately after aspiration of the hematoma in 3 patients. No complications occurred either during or after the operation. This new method for craniostomy is easy, safe, and effective to monitor and rapidly control ICP in the emergency room. This technique also offers the possibility of evaluating the patient's prognosis and determining indications for further decompressive craniectomy by the continuation of ICP control under ICP monitoring and evaluation of the reversibility of pupillary findings in ASDH patients."

    "abstract": "We report the exceptional case of an encapsulated solid non-organized chronic subdural hematoma (SDH) in a 67-year-old woman that was admitted with acute hemiplegia followed by rapid deterioration in consciousness 5 months after a minor head trauma. Computed tomography (CT) showed an extracerebral biconvex shaped hyperdense mass that led to the misdiagnosis of an acute epidural hematoma. Urgent craniotomy revealed an encapsulated mass filled with solid fresh clot in the subdural space. Complete evacuation of this SDH, including both its inner and outer membranes, was achieved, and the patient recovered successfully. Histological analysis confirmed that the content of the hematoma corresponded to a newly formed clot that was enclosed between an inner membrane, composed of two collagen layers, and an outer membrane with a three layered structure. Chronic SDH may seldom present as an encapsulated solid non-organized lesion that consists of a fibrous capsule enclosing a fresh clot and lacking the thick fibrous septations that typically connect the inner and outer membranes of organized chronic SDH. This entity mimics the clinical course and radiological appearance of acute epidural hematomas and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of extracerebral hyperdense biconvex shaped lesions."

Computed tomography (CT) showed an acute, right-sided epidural hematoma and pneumocephalus. Emergency evacuation of the acute epidural hematoma was carried out, and his condition gradually recovered. However, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea continued despite conservative treatment. Three-dimensional reconstructed CT revealed a bone defect, which was approximately 20 mm in size, in the planum sphenoidale and tuberculum sellae, and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a traumatic meningo-encephalocele through the defect, with CSF collection in the sphenoid sinus. Endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery was performed. The 9-mm diameter dural defect was clearly visualized in the sphenoid sinus and was reconstructed with a combination of suturing and overlay with abdominal fascia, and absorbable polyglycolic acid felt. The CSF leakage from a traumatic meningo-encephalocele through the planum sphenoidale was successfully repaired by endoscopic endonasal surgery. Thorough preoperative evaluation of the feasibilities of the endoscopic and transcranial approaches should be based on the preoperative identification of the fistula, the bone defect, and vital structures."

In the four previously reported cases of distal anterior cerebral artery (ACA) aneurysm resulting in pure aSDH, blood distribution in the interhemispheric (IH) space has systematically incriminated the distal ACA as the source of rupture. We present a misleading case of a distal ACA rupture resulting in convexity aSDH with minimal IH blood. A 51-year-old patient presented in coma with decerebrate posturing and a blown left pupil from a left convexity acute hemispheric subdural hematoma. She underwent urgent left craniectomy and subdural hematoma evacuation. Given the absence of identifiable etiology, including trauma, we performed an immediate postoperative Computed tomography-angiography (CTA) in order to rule out an underlying cause. The CTA revealed an aneurysm originating from the callosomarginal artery branch of the ACA. Although the minimal amount of IH blood and the remote distance of convexity blood from the aneurysm suggested that it may be a fortuitous finding, we considered the possibility that the two might be related. The patient underwent surgical aneurysm clipping, confirming that it had ruptured and allowing complete aneurysm obliteration. Following the procedure, the patient's neurological and functional status gradually improved. Ruptured distal ACA aneurysms may present with convexity isolated aSDH with minimal IH blood. Quantity and distribution of isolated aSDH can be misleading and is not always a reliable predictor of aneurysm location. Misinterpretation of the aneurysm as an incidental finding would lead to improper management with potentially serious consequences."

Distal parahypesthesia with sensory level at the nipples was found. The patient suffered urine retention. Laboratory blood tests showed no coagulation disorder. Spiral computed tomography of the cervical region was performed. The CT image revealed a muff-shaped acute epidural hematoma around the cervical dural membrane with lower thickness on the right side and levels from C2 to C4. Emergency right-sided hemilaminectomy of C3 vertebra was performed. A hard blood clot forming acute epidural hematoma was removed. The patient recovered completely for ten days after the surgery. In sudden occurrence of neck pain associated with neurological deficit in the arms spontaneous cervical epidural hematoma should be suspected. Spiral scanner and magnetic resonance are imaging techniques of choice in these patients. The favorable outcome of the disease depends on the prompt diagnosis and emergency removal of the hematoma."

She complained of headache, neck pain, vomiting, dizziness, and was transferred to our hospital. A skull roentgenogram and CT showed occipital bone fracture and thin subarachnoid hemorrhage, and a small amount of acute subdural hematoma on the contra lateral side. Three hours after the accident, she complained of aggravating neck pain. A repeated CT showed acute subdural hematoma at the cranio-vertebral junction extending to the C3 vertrebral body level. At the emergent operation, we found a dural laceration at the foramen magnum just beneath the fracture, and acute spinal subdural hematoma. After evacuation of the hematoma, the patient recovered completely. Spinal acute subdural hematomas after head injuries are relatively rare. In this case, the migration of the extradural hematoma through the dural laceration at the cranio-vertebral junction was supposed to be responsible for the spinal subdural hematoma. It is crucial that a cervical CT be taken to rule out the possibility of spinal hematoma for patients with head injuries complaining of neck pain."

We report here on a case of a patient with a large amount of ASDH that was rapidly reduced. A 61-yr-old man was found unconscious following a high speed motor vehicle accident. On initial examination, his Glasgow Coma Score scale was 4/15. His pupils were fully dilated and non-reactive to bright light. Brain computed tomography (CT) showed a massive right-sided ASDH. The decision was made to treat him conservatively because of his poor clinical condition. Another brain CT approximately 14 hr after the initial scan demonstrated a remarkable reduction of the previous ASDH and there was the new appearance of high density in the subdural space adjacent to the falx and the tentorium. Thirty days after his admission, brain CT revealed chronic SDH and the patient underwent surgery. The patient is currently able to obey simple commands. In conclusion, spontaneous rapid resolution/reduction of ASDH may occur in some patients. The mechanisms are most likely the result of dilution by cerebrospinal fluid and the redistribution of hematoma especially in patients with brain atrophy."

Conservative management was performed under close monitoring because of unexpected improvement of clinical signs and symptoms. Unexpectedly, the ASDH resolved spontaneously within 13 h after the trauma, and he was discharged 1 week later without any neurological deficit. In addition, similar cases reported in literature were reviewed. Because most of the patients developing ASDH underwent emergent surgical intervention, the incidence of this phenomenon may be underestimated. Although emergent surgical removal remains the first choice for the treatment of ASDH, conservative management with careful monitoring may also work out in selected patients who show neurologic and radiologic improvements."

A retrospective case-control review of all patients admitted with a diagnosis of PFEDH between September 1989 and February 1999 was performed. Twenty-one patients (14 men and 7 women) were admitted for PFEDH to Sendai City Hospital. Four patients suffered ACD. All patients had struck their occipital region and had occipital fracture. Patients were treated conservatively on admission because computed tomography (CT) showed no significant findings in 2 patients and PFEDH with minimal symptoms in the others. All patients suffered acute deterioration of consciousness after vomiting. Follow-up CT showed large PFEDH with severe mass effect. Emergency surgery was performed and identified the bleeding point as the venous sinus. The presence of nausea/vomiting was significant risk factor of ACD (Fisher exact test: P = .021). Of the 4 patients, 2 achieved excellent recovery without deficit, 1 was moderately disabled, and 1 died. The outcome of patients with ACD was worse compared to those without ACD (Fisher exact test: P = .046). We should note that vomiting itself could be a significant risk factor of ACD for occipital head trauma. The patients with occipital fracture and vomiting must be observed closely and followed up by CT, even if the initial CT is negative. CT performed shortly after the trauma may reveal no evidence of PFEDH but cannot exclude the development of delayed hematoma."

    "abstract": "The authors report a rare case of petrotentorial meningioma presenting as acute subdural hematoma. A 60-year-old female was introduced to our hospital complaining of sudden headache and gait disturbance. CT and MRI demonstrated a petrotentorial tumor with a subdural hematoma in the posterior fossa. The tumor was enhanced intensively on MRI and showed the dural tail sign. The patient developed progressive impairment of consciousness along with hydrocephalus. After ventricular drainage, emergency intracranial decompression through hematoma evacuation and partial tumor resection was performed. One month later, she improved clinically and the tumor resected totally in the second craniotomy. Histological examination showed a meningothelial meningioma with high vascularity in part. She recovered uneventfully and was discharged on foot. We discussed the etiology of an acute subdural hematoma caused by intratumoral hemorrhage and reviewed past literatures."

    "abstract": "A 57-year-old man was admitted to the Emergency and Critical Care Department with accidental hypothermia (31.5 degrees C) after resuscitation from cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA). Brain CT revealed an acute subdural hematoma. Active core rewarming to 33 degrees C was performed using an intravenous infusion of warm crystalloid. The patient underwent craniotomy soon after admission, with bladder temperature maintained at 33 to 34 degrees C throughout the surgery. Therapeutic hypothermia (34 degrees C) was continued for 2 days, followed by gradual rewarming. After rehabilitation, the patient was able to continue daily life with assistance. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) following CPA is associated with extremely unfavorable outcomes. Very few patients with acute subdural hematomas presenting with accidental hypothermia and CPA have been reported to recover. No suitable strategies have been clearly established for the rewarming performed following accidental hypothermia in patients with TBI. Our experience with this patient suggests that therapeutic hypothermia might improve the outcome in some patients with severe brain injury. It also appears that the method used for rewarming might play an important role in the therapy for TBI with accidental hypothermia."

    "abstract": "To discuss delayed acute subdural hematoma (DASH), a relatively neglected entity, and to emphasize the potentially elevated risk for DASH among elderly, anticoagulated mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. The authors reviewed clinical and radiological data for four patients who had normal neurological examinations and normal computed tomographic scans after mild TBI, and who subsequently developed DASH and deteriorated rapidly. The patients included two men and two women, aged 65 to 86 years, who presented to the emergency department after mild TBI between January 2002 and June 2004. All were treated with chronic anticoagulation or anti-aggregation therapy. They deteriorated owing to DASH from 9 hours to 3 days after TBI. Three of the four patients underwent craniotomy for evacuation of their hematomas. One patient, who suffered only focal neurological deficit, was treated conservatively, and her hematoma gradually resolved. Two patients died and two reached Glasgow Outcome Scores of 3 and 4 after extended inpatient rehabilitation. A suspicion of DASH should be raised in elderly, anticoagulated, mild TBI patients, including those who present to the emergency department with Glasgow Coma Scores of 15 and normal computed tomographic scans after injury. Based on our experience, we recommend that elderly, anticoagulated mild TBI patients should be admitted for 24 to 48 hours of observation after injury."

    "abstract": "A 79-year-old man with a cardiac pacemaker for bradycardia fell down and presented with sudden onset of right hemiplegia and aphasia. Initial computed tomography (CT) showed no cerebral infarction but angiography revealed occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). Local intra-arterial thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA; tisokinase, 1,600,000 units) was performed 3 hours after the onset, and the MCA was partially recanalized. Further administration of tPA was suspended because of nosebleed. However, the patient's neurological findings did not improve. His consciousness gradually deteriorated to coma and quadriplegia with dilation of the left pupil 2.5 hours after thrombolysis. CT disclosed marked mass effect with a left acute subdural hematoma and a small intracerebral hematoma in the left frontal lobe. He underwent urgent craniotomy and removal of the subdural hematoma. The subdural hematoma originated in a frontal cerebral contusion. He died of severe brain edema 2 days after surgery. Acute subdural hematoma is a very rare complication of intra-arterial thrombolysis. Presumably he had suffered head trauma at the first onset. Evidence of head trauma should be considered a contraindication for the use of thrombolytic agents in a patient with acute stroke."

    "abstract": "The etiology and proper treatment of symptomatic subacute subdural hematomas remains to be elucidated. We describe two cases of this entity successfully treated with small craniotomy and evacuation. Both patients initially treated conservatively for traumatic thin subdural hematomas because of poor medical condition and mild neurological symptoms, but suffered abrupt neurological deterioration between 2 and 3 weeks after the admission. CT scan showed decreased density of hematomas with minimal increase in volume, and significant swelling of ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere. Urgent two-burr-hole small craniotomy was effective for evacuation of partially organized hematoma. During surgery, definite hematoma membrane was not confirmed. Postoperatively, brain swelling rapidly disappeared and both patients discharged ambulatory without neurological deficit. The present cases are a reminder of this peculiar type of hematoma in patients with delayed neurological deterioration after nonsurgical management of acute subdural hematoma. The rationale for use of small craniotomy is discussed in terms of current understanding of pathogenetic mechanism for this unusual condition."

A 13-month-old boy was admitted to our emergency department after a car accident. On CT, a thin acute subdural hematoma on the right frontotemporal region and a small epidural hematoma on the left frontal region could be seen. On 24-hour follow-up CT, the right subdural hematoma was found to be less dense but larger than it had been before. At 36 h after hospitalization, CT showed that the right acute subdural hematoma had completely disappeared; however, a delayed traumatic intracerebral hematoma on the left occipital region was identified. We think that the mechanism involved in the development of a delayed intracerebral hematoma in our case was similar to the one causing delayed traumatic intracerebral hematoma after treatment for increased intracranial pressure."

She vomited repeatedly after admission. She became lethargic and exhibited right hemiparesis. CT, taken 2 hours later, revealed enlargement of the left coup EDH, but no enlargement of the right contrecoup EDH. An emergent evacuation of the enlarged coup EDH was performed. Immediately after the operation, she became alert and the right hemiparesis subsided. The contrecoup EDH was conservatively treated, in the absence of enlargement.

The majority of depressed fractures are treated conservatively for fear of bleeding from venous sinuses, but surgical intervention was conducted in a few cases. We report a case of a 59-year-old man with a compound depressed fracture occluding the superior sagittal sinus (SSS). The patient was struck on the head by a heavy iron bar and admitted to our emergency center because of deterioration of consciousness. A computed tomographic scan showed depressed skull fracture overlying the SSS with hemorrhagic lesions in the bilateral parietal lobes and an acute epidural hematoma at the right temporoparietal convexity. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) showed an occlusion of the SSS and compensatory venous drainage associated with poor capillary filling in the left parietal lobe. On an emergency basis, bone fragments compressing the SSS were surgically removed piece-by-piece to resolve severe venous congestion and to avoid infection. A small tear in the SSS was treated by head elevation and compressing the SSS with Gelfoam. Postoperative DSA confirmed the patency of the SSS and normal blood flow in the left parietal lobe. The patient exhibited slight disorientation and was transferred to another hospital for further rehabilitation. Because of symptomatic severe venous congestion, we had to perform emergency surgical decompression and removal of bone fragments. Treatment strategy for depressed skull fracture with SSS involvement was discussed with review of the literature."

    "abstract": "The objective was to evaluate cerebral hemodynamics in young children with acute subdural hematoma (SDH) and the impact of surgical treatment using transcranial Doppler (TCD). The design was a prospective study of infants with SDH requiring surgical evacuation. The setting was the neuro intensive care unit of a university hospital. Indications for surgical evacuation were based upon clinical and radiological arguments. Surgery included emergency needle aspiration followed by external or/and internal shunting as required. A TCD evaluation was performed before needle aspiration, and after each surgical drainage procedure. It included a pressure provocation test to assess cerebral compliance. Preoperative and postoperative middle cerebral artery (MCA) velocities, Gosling pulsatility (PI) and Pourcelot resistivity (RI) indexes and compliance were compared with Student's t-test, or Fisher's exact test as indicated. Out of 26 infants, 23 (88%) had injuries that had possibly been inflicted, and 3 had accidental injuries. Initial TCD evaluation demonstrated intracranial hypertension with decreased diastolic velocity, increased PI and RI, and decreased compliance. Surgical evacuation resulted in statistically significant improvement in cerebral hemodynamics (diastolic velocity: 17.2+/-10 cm/s vs. 31.1+/-10 cm/s, p<0.0015, PI: 2.5+/-1.3 vs. 1.4+/-0.8, p<0.002, RI: 0.8+/-0.2 vs. 0.6+/-0.1, p<0.005) in all but 3 infants, who eventually died. Surgical drainage (primary shunting or external drainage) was needed in 23 infants and resulted in further improvement in cerebral hemodynamics. Finally, 73% of the infants made a good recovery. Children with acute bilateral HSD have a high incidence of increased intracranial pressure as assessed by TCD. Surgical evacuation improves cerebral hemodynamics. TCD could be used for assessing the need for, and the efficiency of surgical drainage."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bilateral extradural hematomas have only rarely been reported in the literature. Even rarer are cases where the hematomas develop sequentially, one after removal of the other. Among 187 cases of operated epidural hematomas during past 4 years in our hospital, we found one case of sequentially developed bilateral epidural hematoma. CASE PRESENTATION: An 18-year-old conscious male worker was admitted to our hospital after a fall. After deterioration of his consciousness, an emergency brain CT scan showed a right temporoparietal epidural hematoma. The hematoma was evacuated, but the patient did not improve afterwards. Another CT scan showed contralateral epidural hematoma and the patient was reoperated. Postoperatively, the patient recovered completely. CONCLUSIONS: This case underlines the need for monitoring after an operation for an epidural hematoma and the need for repeat brain CT scans if the patient does not recover quickly after removal of the hematoma, especially if the first CT scan has been done less than 6 hours after the trauma. Intraoperative brain swelling can be considered as a clue for the development of contralateral hematoma."

    "abstract": "A contralateral extra-axial hematoma sometimes occurs during an operation on an acute subdural hematoma and may become fatal. Using a combined procedure of burr hole evacuation and craniotomy, we treated 2 cases of multiple traumatic acute subdural hematomas. Our policy for such cases is first to perform a burr hole evacuation for the acute subdural hematoma in the emergency room, while simultaneously preparing the operation room for a possible further operation. Next, we perform computed tomography (CT) of the brain. If the evacuation does not provide enough decompression, we either carry out a craniotomy at the same site, or, we observe the patient without resorting to craniotomy. However, if the patient's condition deteriorates, burr hole evacuation is repeated and/or craniotomy is carried out as soon as possible on the lesion at the already prepared operation room. Both of our patients received craniotomy for another subdural hematoma after the burr hole evacuation. Though his intracranial pressure was well managed during the acute stage, one of the patients died 21 days after the trauma due to an extensive brain infarction caused by vasospasm. The other regained consciousness and was able to walk 5 months after the trauma in spite of cerebral infarction from vasospasm. The possible mechanism of vasospasm in severe head injury is also discussed."

    "abstract": "A 75-year-old man suffered acute subdural hematoma shortly after trivial head trauma. Thirteen hours after a trivial brow to the occipital region, caused by contact with a mat, he suddenly deteriorated to the level of a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 6. Computed tomography demonstrated an acute subdural hematoma on the left and angiography revealed an aneurysm of the distal middle cerebral artery. An emergent craniotomy disclosed no skull fracture and exposed a thick subdural hematoma with no brain contusions. After evacuation of the hematoma, an aneurysm was found on the distal portion of posterior temporal artery, which was compatible with the angiographical findings. The neck of aneurysm was so fragile that neck clipping could not be successfully performed. Therefore, the aneurysm was extirpated, and the bleeding site coagulated with oxidized cellulose reinforcement. Histological examination of the aneurysm indicated a pseudoaneurysm during the early phase of clot formation. The acute subdural hematoma resulted from rupture of this pseudoaneurysm which was formed shortly after the minor head trauma. Rupture of a pseudoaneurysm caused by trivial trauma might be one of the origins for so-called acute \"spontaneous\" subdural hematoma."

Rapid spontaneous resolution of the hematoma has been infrequently observed. We report a case of a patient with an acute traumatic subdural hematoma which disappeared without surgery. CT-scan showed a left-sided subdural hematoma with marked mass effect. A low density layer, which implied involvement of CSF in the subdural space, was observed between the hematoma and the inner wall of the skull. We think that the spontaneous resolution of the hematoma was due to the dilution and washing-out by the CSF through an arachnoid tear. Another suggested mechanism in the literature is blood redistribution in the subdural space. Selected patients with an acute subdural hematoma can be managed with conservative treatment."

    "abstract": "Intracranial hemorrhage, either spontaneous or traumatic is a well-known and potentially lethal complication of Warfarin treatment. Patients with Warfarin-related intracranial hemorrhage need urgent reversal of anticoagulation that must be especially rapid if surgical intervention is indicated. The traditional treatment with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K often fails to achieve the desired correction of coagulopathy in urgent neurosurgical settings. In the present case Recombinant Coagulation Factor VIIa (rFVIIa) was used for preoperative reversal of Warfarin-related coagulopathy. The patient was a fifty two years old man, mechanic valve recipient with Warfarin-induced coagulopathy: International Normalization Ratio (INR) of 6.39, who suffered from acute subdural hematoma and needed urgent neurosurgical intervention. He received a single dose of rFVIIa 120 mg/kg and immediately underwent craniotomy and evacuation of the hematoma. Appropriate hemostasis was achieved during surgery and coagulation test taken two hours after rFVIIa injection revealed INR of 1.25. The INR remained normalized for additional 14 hours. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the use of rFVIIa in the preoperative management of Warfarin-induced intracranial hemorrhage. Recombinant Coagulation Factor VIIa provides rapid correction of coagulation to a level that allows safe neurosurgical intervention without significant delay. This agent is safe and effective; and should be considered for reversal of Warfarin-induced coagulopathy in cases of intracranial hemorrhage, especially when urgent surgical intervention is required."

Neurological symptoms improved dramatically just after initiating the burr hole evacuation in both patients. A 57-year-old man became alert and could walk unassisted 1 month after surgery. The other could walk with assistance 4 months after surgery, although psychic disturbance resulting from cerebral contusion remained. Single burr hole evacuation in the emergency room is a useful treatment for acute subdural hematoma of the posterior cranial fossa because the procedure can be performed easily and rapidly, thus achieving reduction of intracranial pressure. Progressing neurological deterioration, reversibility of brainstem function by mannitol administration and the sign of brainstem compression and noncommunicating hydrocephalus are good indicators for this treatment."

A 55-year-old female experienced severe headache on October 9, 1999, which did not improve after medication. Four days later, left ptosis began. She was admitted to the department of ophthalmology to treat oculomotor nerve paresis. A computed tomography (CT) scan obtained on admission, revealed no obvious abnormality. She was treated by hormonal therapy, but her symptoms continued. Ten days later, she suddenly lost consciousness and was transferred to our hospital. Although the CT scan revealed a thick left SDH with marked midline shift, SAH was absent. Her neurological state was Hunt & Kosnik grade IV. A left carotid angiogram revealed an IC-PC aneurysm with active extravasation. The patient was taken to the operating room for emergency removal of the SDH and aneurysmal neck clipping. During the operation, adhesion between the aneurysmal dome and the arachnoid was observed, but subarachnoid hemorrhage was not identified at all. The aneurysm was successfully clipped. Postoperatively, her consciousness improved immediately. In this case, the pure acute SDH identified by CT was responsible for causing the direct hemorrhage into the subdural space via an adhesive lesion."

While the hypothermia was effective in lowering the elevated ICP, it failed to arrest progression of the infarction. The patient was discharged with mild disability 2 months after the injury. No serious complications occurred during or after the hypothermia. Our experience indicates that hypothermia can be a useful procedure for controlling the ICP in children with severe traumatic brain injury including acute subdural hematoma, although its capability to protect the brain from severe, progressive ischemia appears to be limited."

The frequency of SDH resulting from aneurysmal rupture is summarized, and its clinical and radiological characteristics, as well as potential pitfalls in the diagnosis and the management of this life-threatening condition are described. Among 641 patients with nontraumatic SAH treated between 1992 and 2000, 12 patients (1.9%) presented with SDH due to aneurysmal rupture. The SAH grade on admission was grade II in one patient, grade IV in three patients, and grade V in eight patients. Four underwent both hematoma evacuation and clipping of the aneurysm, four underwent hematoma evacuation alone, and the other four patients were treated conservatively. The outcome was good recovery in two patients, severe disability in one patient, and death in nine patients. Patients with a good outcome had a better SAH grade on admission, smaller midline shift, and smaller SDH volume on the initial CT scan, and they had been treated by both SDH evacuation and clipping of the aneurysm. Emergency one-stage operations may be beneficial for aneurysmal SDH patients who are in good SAH grade, or those who are in poor SAH grade but show some neurological recovery after resuscitation. It should also be mentioned that there are cases of aneurysmal SDH without recognizable SAH on the CT scans, and that a case of aneurysmal SDH may present as a case of 'head trauma' after an accident, because of the disturbance of consciousness resulting from aneurysmal rupture."

Head computed tomography (CT) revealed an open depressed fracture, an acute epidural hematoma 1 cm thick in the left middle frontal fossa, and a longitudinal fracture of the clivus. Emergency removal of the hematoma was performed with cranioplasty. Head CT 8 hours 50 minutes after injury showed infarctions in the brain stem, cerebellum, and occipital lobes. Cerebral angiography revealed occlusion of the basilar artery in the middle part of the clivus. The patient died after 3 days. Autopsy revealed that the basilar artery was trapped in the clivus fracture site. Vertebrobasilar artery occlusion due to trapping in a clivus fracture has a very poor prognosis. Diagnosis is difficult and generally only confirmed at autopsy.

Pathological reports showed abnormal proliferation of Langerhans' cells, eosinophilic cells and multinucleated cells. A whole-body bone nuclide scan revealed no other bone lesions. The patient was discharged uneventfully. The causes of hematomas are not very clear. They may be due to tumor necrosis or minor trauma. In our presented case, the cause of the epidural hematoma may have been tumor bleeding which ruptured into the epidural space. A solitary eosinophilic granuloma of the skull with acute epidural hematoma and loss of consciousness is extremely uncommon. Craniectomy with removal of the tumor and hematoma decompression may produce good results."

In all patients, without delaying treatment, a separate surgical team (including the senior author) placed an ICP monitor and a jugular bulb catheter, and in two patients a laser Doppler probe was placed. The ICP prior to removing the bone flap in the five patients was 85, 85, 50, 59, and greater than 40 mm Hg, resulting in CPPs of 25, 3, 25, 56, and less than 50 mm Hg, respectively. Removing the bone flap as well as opening the dura and removing the blood clot produced a significant decrease in ICP and an increase in CPP. Jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO2) increased in four patients and decreased in the other during removal of the hematoma. Laser Doppler flow also increased, to 217% and 211% compared with preevacuation flow. Intracranial pressure is higher than previously suspected and CPP is very low in patients with ASDH. Removal of the bone flap yielded a significant reduction in ICP, which was further decreased by opening the dura and evacuating the hematoma. The SjvO2 as well as laser Doppler flow increased in all patients but one immediately after removal of the hematoma."

    "abstract": "Cavernous sinus dural arteriovenous shunt (CdAVS) usually presents with exophthalmos, conjunctival chemosis, ophthalmoplegia, headache, bruit, or pulsatile tinnitus. Intracranial hemorrhage associated with CdAVS is rare. We describe a patient with CdAVS presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage and acute subdural hematoma. A 65-year-old woman presented headache and temporary loss of consciousness and was transferred to our hospital. On admission, the patient was alert and complained of a left-sided temporal headache. There were no ocular symptoms. A CT scan revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage and left acute subdural hematoma. When we prepared for cerebral angiography, the patient presented loss of consciousness following sudden onset of severe headache. Urgent angiography revealed left CdAVS, which was fed by both the internal carotid artery and the external carotid artery and drained only into ipsilateral (left) vein of the sylvian fissure. Aneurysmal dilatation of the draining veins and leptomeningeal drainage were present. No cerebral aneurysms were detected. After the angiography, a CT scan showed enlarged subdural hematoma, so left fronto-temporo-parietal craniotomy was immediately performed. On opening the dura mater, arterial bleeding from Sylvian fissure appeared and was uncontrollable. Unfortunately, the patient died 3 days after the operation. We concluded that subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural hematoma were due to the rupture of engorged cortical veins. Our case report suggests that CdAVS with angiographic findings such as aneurysmal dilatation of the draining veins and leptomeningeal drainage should be treated urgently because of the high risk of the life-threatening complications resulting from a surgically uncontrollable hemorrhage."

    "abstract": "Computed tomography (CT) has revolutionized the diagnosis and management of head-injured patients, and its increasing availability has led to its liberal use. CT scanning provides excellent anatomic detail of the brain as fixed static images, but the dynamic nature of human physiology means that many injury patterns will evolve in time. We describe an 8-year-old child who had fallen 8 feet from a tree. He had a brief loss of consciousness but a normal neurologic evaluation on arrival to the emergency department (ED). He underwent expedited cranial CT scanning, which revealed no acute brain injury. Two and one half hours later, the patient had a mild depression in consciousness, prompting a second CT scan in the ED, which revealed an acute epidural hematoma. He had acute surgical evacuation of the hematoma and made a full neurologic recovery. This case illustrates that a single early CT examination may at times provide a false sense of security and underscores the importance of serial neurologic examinations."

A 62-year-old woman presented with headache two months after minor head trauma. Computed tomography (CT) scanning revealed CSDH with mixed density on the right side. Prior to percutaneous subdural tapping, twist-drill craniostomy was performed at the parietal tuber. When the drill-needle reached the dura mater, the patient began to complain of headache, which was followed by altered consciousness. CT scanning disclosed acute epidural hematoma abutting the CSDH; both hematomas were evacuated by emergency craniotomy. At surgery, no definite bleeding source was identified apart from oozing on the dura mater. Hemorrhagic complications after percutaneous subdural tapping are rare. The formation of acute epidural hematoma during twist-drill craniostomy has not been reported in the literature. This complication can occur when the blunt tip of the drill-needle remains on the dura mater without penetrating into the subdural hematoma cavity."

We performed a prospective study to determine if significant intracranial injury could be excluded in patients with GCS-15 and a normal complete neurological examination. A prospective trial of clinically sober adult patients with GCS = 15 on emergency department (ED) presentation after closed head injury with loss of consciousness or amnesia was conducted from May 1996 through April 1997. All subjects underwent a standardized neurological examination including mental status evaluation, and assessment of motor, sensory, cerebellar and reflex function before CT scan. During the study period, 58 patients met inclusion criteria. Fifty-five patients (95%) had normal CT scans and 23 (42%) had focal neurological abnormalities. Three patients (5%) had CT scan findings of acute intracranial injury, two of whom had normal neurological examinations. One patient had an acute subdural hematoma requiring emergent surgical decompression; the other had both an epidural hematoma and pneumocephalus that did not require surgery. Significant brain injury and need for CT scanning cannot be excluded in patients with minor head injury despite a GCS = 15 and normal complete neurological examination on presentation."

    "title": "Decompressive surgery in acute head injuries: where should it be performed?",
    "abstract": "In Norway, most patients with severe head injuries are transported to, and operated in, the neurosurgical unit of the regional university hospital. However, some patients are still occasionally operated on in county central hospitals by orthopedic or general surgeons who do not have neurosurgical expertise. The aim was to analyze this surgical activity outside the neurosurgical units. Data were collected from two sources: a nation-wide survey and the records of all patients with a severe head injury occurring within Vestfold county (1987-1996). The Norwegian county central hospitals perform each only 2.5 to 3 surgical evacuations of intracranial hematomas per year. In Vestfold county, a total of 161 patients were hospitalized alive with an acute severe head injury. One third of the patients (54 patients) underwent decompressive surgery, mostly evacuations of intracranial hematomas. The patients operated on in the central hospital had a significantly worse outcome than the patients who were transferred to and operated on in the neurosurgical unit of the regional hospital. Only patients with extracerebral hematomas were operated on in the central hospital. Patients with an extradural (epidural) hematoma had a better outcome than patients with an acute subdural hematoma. Based on the surgery records and preoperative and postoperative computed tomographic scans, one third of the operations (10 operations) in the central hospital were classified retrospectively as inadequate, because the hematoma was not evacuated or found or because the surgeons did not achieve control of the perioperative bleeding. The overall mortality rate was 29.8%. The present study indicates that, in Norway and countries with a similar hospital system, it must be difficult for general and orthopedic surgeons to achieve and maintain the skills required for emergency operations in patients with acute severe head injuries. Thus, it is probably to the patients' benefit to improve the general hospitals' competency and speed in the detection of candidates for surgical decompression, and stress the importance of these patients being transferred without unnecessary delay to a neurosurgical unit."

Thirty-three hours later, he suddenly developed severe headache, vomiting, and anisocoria just after a positional change. CT revealed typical acute subdural hematoma (ASDH), which was confirmed by emergent decompressive craniectomy. He was vegetative postoperatively and died of pneumonia one month later. Emergent surgical exploration is recommended for this type of ASDH even if the symptoms are mild due to aged atrophic brain."

An 83-year-old man was found lying down on the floor but he was conscious. Thirty minutes later, he lost consciousness and was transferred to our hospital in a comatose state with right hemiparesis. Plain CT scan showed a left temporoparietal acute subdural hematoma with subarachnoid hemorrhage. CT scan also demonstrated an iso-density area beneath a high-density around the left Sylvian fissure. We performed an emergent 3D-CTA to rule out ruptured aneurysm as the cause of hemorrhage. However, 3D-CTA revealed no cerebral aneurysm, but extravasation of contrast medium from the cortical artery of the left temporal cortex was noted. The patient immediately underwent total evacuation of subdural hematoma by small temporoparietal craniectomy under local anesthesia. We found 3D-CTA to be a useful, less-invasive method for diagnosing the hemorrhagic cause and localizing the bleeding point. It is expected that with more routine use of 3D-CTA in patients with acute subdural hematoma, extravasation of the contrast medium will be seen more frequently. Subdural hematoma with extravasation of contrast medium required emergent surgery, and 3D-CTA findings facilitated the selection of the surgical method according to the bleeding point."

    "abstract": "Traumatic subacute subdural hematoma is a condition in which the major symptoms affecting prognosis most appear in the subacute stage after head trauma, while traumatic acute subdural hematoma is treated conservatively when the symptoms are mild. The cause of the major symptoms occurring in the subacute stage is mostly expansion of the subdural hematoma volume. The authors report a case of traumatic subacute subdural hematoma in which the cause of the major symptoms was cerebral hemispheric edema instead of expansion of the subdural hematoma volume. To our knowledge, only one similar case to the present case has been previously reported. A 44-year-old female fell from the stairs on July 21, 1995 and was suffering from headache. On July 23, she was admitted to our hospital because of generalized convulsion. On admission, she was drowsy but showed no convulsion. Head CT showed an acute subdural hematoma on the right side with a slight midline shift and no other abnormalities. She was treated conservatively because of the mildness of the symptoms and two days later became alert with no symptoms. Thereafter she only complained of occasional headache which was controlled with medicine. On August 3, she suddenly fell into coma. Head CT showed severe cerebral hemispheric edema on the right side without change of the subdural hematoma size. Emergency cerebral angiography showed no definitive abnormalities such as occlusion of the arteries or of the venous sinuses. Craniotomy associated with external decompression was performed. The hematoma was composed of red-brown jelly accompanied with some liquid component and had a thin black-brown outer membrane. While removing the hematoma, bleeding from a vein on the cerebral surface around the sylvian fissure was observed and this location was suspected to be the sources of the bleeding point. Postoperatively, she received steroid and barbiturate therapy associated with moderate hypothermia under hyperventilation. She tolerated this treatment well and left the hospital, on September 26, 1995 with only diplopia during downward gaze. Although the mechanisms of the cerebral hemispheric edema occurring in the subacute stage was unclear, a failure in the cerebral venous circulation arising from compression to the bridging veins, which may be hypoplastic, by the subdural hematoma was suspected to have been the cause."

    "abstract": "Patients who have an acute subdural hematoma with a thickness of 10 mm or less and with a shift of the midline structures of 5 mm or less often can be treated nonoperatively. We wonder whether the knowledge of the clinical status both in the prehospital determination and on admission to the neurosurgical center can predict the need for evacuation of subdural hematomas as well as the computed tomographic (CT) parameters. From January 1, 1994, to May 31, 1996, 65 comatose patients harboring an acute subdural hematoma of 5 mm or more and not brain dead were admitted to our intensive care unit. Of the 65 patients, 15 patients were initially managed conservatively according to a protocol based on clinical, CT, and intracranial pressure parameters. During the study period, the use of long-lasting paralytic agents has been eliminated to allow detection of clinical deterioration in the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score from the prehospital determination to the hospital admission assessment. Of the 15 patients initially managed conservatively, two were subsequently operated on because of evolving parenchymal hematomas. When comparing demographic, clinical, and CT parameters between the surgical group of patients and the patients initially conservatively treated, hematoma thickness (mean, 17.1 mm vs. 7.5 mm, p < 0.0001) and shift of the midline structures (mean, 12.8 mm vs. 4.7 mm, p < 0.008) were predictive of the need for surgery. A statistically significant change in the GCS score between prehospital determination and admission assessment was shown in the surgical group of patients (mean GCS score, 8.4 vs. 6.7, p < 0.01), and it was not present (mean GCS score, 7.3 vs. 7.2) in the patients initially conservatively treated. Functional outcomes were present in 23 cases (35.4%); functional outcomes in the initially conservatively treated patients were reached by 10 patients (66.7%). Nonoperative management for selected cases of acute subdural hematomas is at least as safe as surgical management. GCS scoring at the scene and in the emergency room combined with early and subsequent CT scanning is crucial when making the decision for nonoperative management. This strategy requires that administration of long-lasting sedatives and paralytic medications be avoided before the patient arrives at the neurosurgical center."

    "abstract": "The outcome of acute subdural hematoma (ASDH), which can cause severe parenchymal injury, has generally been unsatisfactory. The standard surgical procedure for ASDH is a quick and wide opening by dural incision, removal of the subdural and contusional intracerebral hematoma, followed by large external and internal decompression. In this study, we assessed our therapeutic strategy, consisting of three principles: 1. Removal of subdural hematoma by wide craniotomy-small dural incisions, in well-decompressed case, connecting the small dural incisions and stanching the bleeding points on the cortical surface but not proceeding with contusional hemorrhage in emergency operations, 2. Post-operative induction of mild barbiturate-moderate hypothermia therapy and 3. Intentionally delayed evacuation of the intracerebral contusional hemorrhage when needed. The patients, profile is composed of an old therapy group (27 cases) and a new therapy group (20 cases) suffering from ASDH with cerebral contusion. The clinical outcome with the old therapeutic strategy was good recovery (GR) in 7 cases, moderate disability (MD) in 5, severe disability (SD) in 2, vegetative state (PVS) in 3 and death (D) in 10, whereas the outcome with the new strategy resulted in GR in 15 cases, MD in 3, D in 2. These clinical results indicate that the rates of mortality and severe morbidity were markedly reduced with our new therapeutic strategy."

The patient was a 68-year-old female who was found unconscious at home and transferred to the emergency medical center in a state of deep coma. Her consciousness on admission to the center was 200P (Japan coma scale), E1V1M2 (Glasgow Coma Scale), and the Hunt & Kosnik grade was grade IV. She was in a state of decerebrate condition. Computed tomography (CT) scans revealed diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage that was located mainly in the posterior fossa, as well as intraventricular hemorrhage in the third and fourth ventricles. It also disclosed an intracerebellar hematoma (ICH) of the vermis and an acute SDH of the left posterior fossa. The first cerebral angiographic examinations on admission demonstrated no aneurysm. However, emergency surgery was performed immediately in order to improve her poor condition. Ventricular drainage and removal of the acute SDH were carried out. Postoperatively, her consciousness improved gradually to 20P. Ventricular peritoneal shunt was performed three weeks later. Her consciousness improved up to 3P and she showed only slight truncal ataxia. She was admitted to our hospital for rehabilitation at two months after the first surgery. Repeated angiography was performed and demonstrated an aneurysm in the telovelotonsillar segment of the left PICA. The aneurysm was successfully clipped via a midline suboccipital approach. Her postoperative course was uneventful, and she continues to undergo rehabilitation. Aneurysms of the posterior fossa associated with acute SDH are extremely rare. Only two cases have been reported for distal PICA aneurysm cases. The CT scans in our patient revealed not only SAH but also SDH in the posterior fossa and ICH in the vermis. Over 100 cases of distal PICA aneurysms have been described in the literature. We analyzed the relationship between the portions with the ruptured aneurysms and CT findings. Aneurysms which were located at the proximal portion of the distal PICA mainly showed SAH and IVH. On the other hand, ICHs of the vermis and cerebellum were characteristic CT findings of ruptured aneurysms which were located more distal to the telovelotonsillar segment, and were evident in 14% of cases of such aneurysms. ICH and SDH were not found in aneurysms which were located in portions more proximal to the telovelotonsillar segment. These characteristic findings were related to the complex anatomical courses of the PICA. The distal portions of the PICA run between the vermis and cerebellar hemisphere, so that if an aneurysm ruptures at these portions, ICHs in the vermis and cerebellum tend to occur. In cases such as ours, because of the characteristic CT findings, effort to detect a distal PICA aneurysm should be made at first surgery, along with ventricular drainage and removal of the SDH. The surgical procedures and outcome of cases with distal PICA aneurysms are also discussed."

In this report, we discuss the difficulties in treating this condition surgically, and we emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of abused children and their parents. Case 1: A girl, aged 2 months, was brought in by her mother, because the child had become drowsy. The mother stated that the child had been battered by her father. Physical examination revealed tense anterior fontanelle, bruises on her face, consciousness disturbance and retinal bleeding. Marked anemia was revealed on laboratory studies. A computed tomographic (CT) scan demonstrated an interhemispheric subdural hematoma in the parietooccipital region. She was treated conservatively for 2 months. Follow-up CT revealed a bilateral chronic subdural hematoma. Burr hole irrigation and drainage on both sides brought about complete disappearance of these lesions. Case 2: A girl, aged 1 year and 9 months, was brought in by her parents. According to her mother's allegation, the child fell down from the top of an indoor slide and became comatose. Physical examination revealed severe malnutrition, loss of consciousness, dilated pupils and negative light reflex. Numerous areas of subcutaneous bleeding and skin erosions were seen on her back and abdomen. Marked anemia was revealed on laboratory studies. CT scan demonstrated a left acute subdural hematoma and massive brain swelling. Despite an emergency craniotomy, the child died 5 days later. Case 3: A 4-year-old boy was admitted in a comatose state. According to his mother's allegation, he was thrown to the floor from a 1.5m height and struck against a wall by his father. Physical examination revealed severe malnutrition, consciousness loss, dilated pupils and negative light reflex. Many scratches and bruises were seen over his whole body, especially on his back. Marked anemia was revealed on laboratory studies. A CT scan demonstrated a left acute subdural hematoma and massive brain swelling. Three days later, he died despite emergency craniotomy. The incidence of battered children is increasing in Japan, and these cases sometimes involve severe head injuries, such as subdural hematoma. In these cases, successful surgical treatment is difficult after admission to the neurosurgical institute. This may result from late admission as well as marked anemia and malnutrition. Therefore, we conclude that early diagnosis of child abuse and treatment of the abused child and psychological treatment for their parents are very important."

During an emergency craniotomy a large epidural hematoma was evacuated and external decompression was performed. Angiography, which was performed about one month after the head injury, revealed an aneurysm of the middle meningeal artery.

    "abstract": "Cervical spinal epidural hematoma is an unusual neurosurgical disorder that usually requires emergent surgical decompressive therapy. We report the case of an 85-year-old woman with acute, severe neck and shoulder pain with progressive neurologic deficits. A computed tomography scan of the neck revealed an acute cervical spinal epidural hematoma. This case involves an unusual cause of neck pain in an elderly patient with no history of trauma. It is incumbent on the emergency physician to recognize this disorder and arrange emergent neurosurgical consultation to ensure an optimal outcome. Further, the differential diagnosis of neck pain and progressive neurologic findings should include this entity."

    "abstract": "A 16-year-old football player developed a headache following a collision during a game. When his headache persisted for 1 week, he underwent a computerized tomographic (CT) scan to determine the cause. Findings were normal and a concussion was diagnosed. Seventeen days after the injury, the athlete reported disappearance of his symptoms. Provocative testing failed to recreate symptoms. The athlete continued to deny any symptoms and was cleared for unlimited participation 30 days after the initial injury. In the next game, the athlete collided with an opposing player, ran to the sidelines, and deteriorated on the sidelines after complaining of dizziness. Local Emergency Medical Squad personnel intubated him and transported him to a local hospital emergency room. Attending neurosurgeons diagnosed a right subdural hematoma by CT scan. A burr hole craniotomy evacuated the lesion. The operative report noted a second area of chronic membrane formation consistent with past head trauma. This lesion had escaped detection on two CT scans. In an interview 4 months postoperatively, the athlete admitted having experienced constant symptoms between the first and second injuries."

    "abstract": "The acute epidural hematoma is a real surgical emergency with a good outcome if the operation is performed in reasonable delays. In 1994, too many young patients eventually died or were left with major disabilities, because of an unacceptable and almost always avoidable loss of time.

    "abstract": "The authors report a rare case of acute cervical epidural hematoma caused by the hemorrhage from extradural arterio-venous malformation. The patient was a 74-year-old Japanese man with a past history of total gastrectomy after being diagnosed as having gastric cancer 12 years before. Six hours prior to admission, the patient had experienced a sudden episode of severe nuchal pain radiating to both scapular areas, followed by rapid development of left-side Brown-Sequard Syndrome below the C4 cord level, and urinary incontinence. Plain cervical X-ray films did not show any destructive lesion suggesting a metastatic tumor. T1 and T2 weighted images of MRI demonstrated a high intensity mass lesion, suggesting an acute epidural hematoma, extending from C3 to C6 and compressing severely the left side spinal cord posteriorly. Twelve hours after the onset of symptoms, emergency laminectomy from C3 to C6 was performed and a fresh epidural clot with small vascular tissue was totally removed. Histological examination of the small vascular tissue in the hematoma revealed arterio-venous malformation. The postoperative recovery of the patient was dramatic. He regained full muscle strength and there was complete disappearance of sensory deficits 2 weeks after the operation. Although acute spinal epidural hematoma caused by extradural arterio-venous malformation is a rare clinical entity, MRI is the most helpful diagnostic tool for this condition. It should be stressed that accurate neuroradiological diagnosis and prompt surgical decompression of the spinal cord are essential to obtain an excellent surgical outcome."

    "abstract": "Two cases of ruptured distal anterior cerebral-artery aneurysms presenting with acute subdural hematoma are reported. Case 1 was a 55-year-old male, who showed abrupt disturbance of consciousness. An emergency CT revealed acute subdural hematoma at the right parietal convexity and interhemispheric fissure with moderate midline shift. There was no evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Right carotid angiography showed an aneurysm at the right distal anterior cerebral artery. An emergency external decompression was performed and the aneurysm was clipped successfully through the interhemispheric fissure. In the operative field, subarachnoid hemorrhage could not been seen, and the patient had uneventful recovery. Case 2 was a 66-year-old female, who complained of severe headache. She deteriorated rapidly and become comatous with development of anisocoria. An emergency CT revealed acute subdural hematoma on the bilateral parietal convexities and interhemispheric fissure with severe midline shift. There was no evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Carotid angiography showed right distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysm. An emergency external decompression was performed, then the aneurysm was clipped successfully. She recovered with disorientation and hemiparesis. Ruptured distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysms presenting with acute subdural hematoma without subarachnoid hemorrhage are rare. It is suggested that CT scans and history of patients are most important but an emergency angiography was prerequisite for correct diagnosis. Surgical treatment should be the best management in such cases."

    "abstract": "A rare case of acute subdural hematoma due to dural metastasis from malignant pleural mesothelioma is reported. A 65-year-old man was brought to a nearby hospital complaining of lumbago. He suddenly complained of headache on the third hospital day and fell into a deep coma within a short while. Computed tomography showed a crescent shaped high density area in the right fronto-temporo-parietal region with midline shift to the left side. He was admitted as an emergency case to our clinic on April 24, 1989. Under the diagnosis of acute spontaneous subdural hematoma, emergency operation was performed. Nests of malignant sarcomatous cells were found in the clot obtained during the procedure, but the origin of the tumoral cells could not be identified. The patient failed to recover from the comatose state and died with pancytopenia on the 17th hospital day. General autopsy showed wide-spread malignant pleural mesothelioma with metastases to the lung, liver and bone marrow. Examination of the head revealed dural metastatic tumor and a subdural hematoma over the left hemisphere. Histopathology showed that many tumor cell nests were found only within the dilated veins of the dura. There, acute subdural hematoma was assumed to have developed suddenly and there was massive bleeding from the capillaries of the inner vascular layer of the dura. The relevant literature about intracranial metastasis of malignant pleural mesothelioma was reviewed, and the mechanism of subdural hematoma due to dural metastasis from malignant tumor was discussed."

She was managed in emergency as follows: cranial computed tomography, general anaesthesia, caesarean section, cerebral angiography, evacuation of the subdural haematoma and clipping of the aneurysm. The outcome was excellent. Pure subdural haematoma from ruptured aneurysm, with little or no subarachnoid, intraventricular or intracerebral haemorrhage is very rare. We discuss the treatment of such a haematoma and discuss the other causes for spontaneous subdural haematomas. Our observation stresses the need for a high-performance technical plate in the management of ruptured aneurysms, but also for the importance of a correct clinical diagnosis of minor leaks by the general practitioners who decide on the hospitalization."

Laboratory data of the patient including bleeding time were within normal limits. The cause of the postoperative intracranial hematoma was the rapid surgical decompression of the initial lesion, and we considered that it could be prevented if chronic subdural hematoma was treated using closed system drainage and slow decompression. But acute epidural hematoma occurred after this operative procedure and it was accelerated by evacuation of the chronic subdural hematoma through the drain. An emergent craniotomy and removal of the hematoma was performed, so the patient was discharged from hospital with satisfactory neurological recovery. A careful check of the evacuated hematoma volume is very important, and CT scanning should be immediately performed if postoperative hematoma is suspected."

    "abstract": "A 74-year-old woman sought treatment after an initial subarachnoid hemorrhage verified on computed tomographic scan with no focal neurological deficit. Shortly after admission, she sustained a second subarachnoid hemorrhage with acute neurological decompensation. A repeat computed tomographic scan revealed increased blood along the right medial temporal region, as well as in the interhemispheric fissure and bilateral sylvian cisterns. Also evident was a right hemispheric acute subdural hematoma. The patient's rapidly deteriorating neurological status precluded a cerebral angiogram; therefore, a double-dose infusion computed tomographic scan was performed. This revealed a cerebral artery aneurysm adjacent to the right medial temporal hematoma. She was taken to the operating room on the basis of this study. After evacuation of the right hemispheric subdural hematoma and clipping of the right posterior communicating artery aneurysm, the patient made a rapid, full neurological recovery."

    "abstract": "The authors review the seizure incidence in 4232 adult patients with mild closed head injury who did not receive prophylactic anticonvulsant agents. One hundred patients (2.36%) experienced seizures within 1 week after head injury; 43 of these (1.02% of the series) had seizures within 24 hours after trauma. Most of the seizures (84%) that developed during the 1st week after injury were of the generalized tonic-clonic type. The incidence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures was higher than that of partial seizures with motor symptoms both within 24 hours (91% vs. 9%) and during the Day 2 to 7 period (79% vs. 21%). No definite intracranial pathological findings were detected by computerized tomography (CT) in 53% of patients with early posttraumatic seizures; six patients had intracranial hemorrhage without intracranial parenchymal damage (three with epidural hematoma and three with subarachnoid hemorrhage). The most common positive CT findings in the early posttraumatic-seizure group were intracerebral hemorrhage (24%), followed by acute subdural hematoma with intracerebral hemorrhage (17%). Intracerebral parenchymal damage could be identified on CT scans in 41 (48.8%) of 84 patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures and five (31%) of 16 patients with partial seizures with motor symptoms. The intracerebral parenchymal damage was most commonly detected in the frontal lobe (21%) and the temporal lobe (19%). Seven patients with early posttraumatic seizures received emergency craniotomy to remove an intracranial hematoma (epidural in three, subdural and intracerebral in four) because the mass effect resulted in significant midline shift as seen on CT scans. This review suggests that early posttraumatic seizures after mild closed head injury have a high incidence (53%) in patients with normal CT scan findings. Although the possibility of surgically correctable intracranial hemorrhage is low (7%), the condition may be devastating if not treated properly."

Case 1: A-50-year-old male was admitted because of sudden headache and epileptic seizure. Computed tomographic (CT) scan showed a right thin subdural hematoma, but cerebral angiography demonstrated no pathological findings, that might cause acute subdural hematoma on the follow-up CT scans. The hematoma changed to a chronic one within only 15 days, which was proved by the operation. Case 2: A 52-year-old male was hospitalized because of loss of consciousness. CT scan revealed a right subdural hematoma without subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral angiography demonstrated a right middle cerebral artery aneurysm. The hematoma was surgically proved to be due to rupture of the aneurysm. Case 3: A 52-year-old male was admitted because of headache, vomiting and left motor weakness. CT scan showed a thick right subdural hematoma and right carotid angiography revealed two internal carotid artery aneurysms. It was surgically certified that the subdural hematoma was caused by a tear in a cortical artery attached to the dura, not by the rupture of the aneurysms. Clinical cause and pathogenesis of so-called \"non-traumatic\" or \"spontaneous\" acute subdural hematomas were discussed, and the importance of emergency angiography for this condition is stressed."

The advantage of this operation is its minimal operative invasion, giving rise to few operative complications. During 10 years of practice, however, we encountered some perioperative problems. Perioperative cerebral infarction of varying severity was seen in six Moyamoya patients. Severe hyperventilation with crying was the main trigger of infarction. Two patients developed wound infection with Gram-negative rods. Removal of an infected bone flap was necessary. One Moyamoya patient developed malignant hyperthermia during the operation. One acute epidural hematoma necessitated an emergency hematoma removal. Five patients showed a temporary aggravation of involuntary movements. Prolonged mild fever and temporary and limited hair loss around the wound were often observed. Cases and their treatment are presented with discussion of preventive measures."

A case of ruptured middle cerebral artery aneurysm which was clipped nine years before resulting in acute subdural hematoma is reported. At 6 pm on July 21, 1988, a 53-year-old woman with severe headache starting at 4:20 pm was transferred to our hospital. She suffered from herniated signs; Conscious disturbance; anisocoria; positive OCR; decerebrate posture. An emergency CT showed right acute subdural hematoma with severe midline shift. Following a decompressing craniotomy at 9 pm, the subdural clot was evacuated. It measured 90g in volume and the underlying cortex was normal. There was no evidence of SAH. Right carotid angiography three weeks after the first operation showed a middle cerebral artery aneurysm at the site of a clip which had been applied nine years ago. A second operation was performed on August 30, 1988. Via the right pterional route, the middle cerebral artery aneurysm was clipped successfully with a Sugita's clip replacing the first clip. We concluded that the regrowth and rebleeding of the middle cerebral artery aneurysm which had been clipped nine years before was most probable. She was discharged with slightly decreased consciousness and right motor weakness, on November 13, 1988."

    "abstract": "Sixty-two cases of acute subdural hematoma were clinically analyzed with special reference to such prognostic factors as age, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score on admission, pupillary signs, decerebration, and initial computed tomography (CT) findings. Intraparenchymal lesions demonstrated by CT were evaluated according to Yamaura's classification. In 19 cases, serum fibrin and fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) were measured at the time of admission. Emergency surgery was performed in 46 cases, and the remaining 16 patients were treated conservatively. The final outcome was judged according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale, and patients were divided into a \"good outcome\" group (good recovery or moderate disability) and a \"poor outcome\" group (severe disability, vegetative state, or death). In general, the outcomes proved to be unsatisfactory. Forty-four patients (71%) had a poor outcome, with 32/62 (52%) mortality, and only 18 (29%) had a good outcome. The clinical factors associated with a poor outcome were age over 64 years, a GCS score on admission of less than 7, decerebration, and absence of pupillary reaction to light. Initial CT scans showed brain damage in 46 patients (74%), 39 (85%) of whom had a poor outcome. This indicates that the outcome was significantly related to brain injury complicating the acute subdural hematoma. A high serum FDP level was similarly related to a poor outcome, which suggests that the serum FDP level reflects the degree of both primary and secondary brain injury. Thus, measurement of serum FDP may be valuable both in assessing clinical status and in evaluating the extent of brain injury in acute subdural hematoma."

    "abstract": "A 41-year-old woman was admitted to our clinic because of an acute subdural hematoma. After an emergency operation her neurological status improved with an increase in the Glasgow Coma Scale score from 6 to 11. On the second postoperative day she developed frequent episodes of clonic convulsive seizures localized in the face and the left upper extremity, and her level of consciousness deteriorated. Next day she was transnasally intubated for respiratory management, but no mechanical ventilation was required. While she was undergoing the CT scanning 5 days after intubation, respiratory arrest and cyanosis developed all of a sudden, and her face and neck became swollen. The chest x-ray revealed a marked subcutaneous emphysema, mediastinal emphysema and bilateral pneumothorax. CT at that time showed a diffuse low density area in the right hemisphere, and a marked midline shift returned. She did not regain consciousness and died 12 days after the incident. At autopsy an ulcer was observed in the wall of the trachea, where the tip or the cuff of the transnasal tracheal tube was supposed to be present. No perforation, however, was there. Case 2: A 75-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of SAH. In hospital course she was also transnasally intubated and required no mechanical ventilation. When she was undergoing the CT scanning 3 days after intubation, she developed subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema similarly to case 1. Although it is reported to be not a rare complication in patients on a mechanical ventilator, subcutaneous emphysema or pneumothorax is extremely rare in those intubated patients with spontaneous respiration. The mechanism of these complications in these cases is briefly discussed."

    "abstract": "In 62 battered children with involvement of the central nervous system clinically 3 patterns of impact to the skull, brain and its coverings could be distinguished: In 22 babies (mean age 6 months) the brain was damaged mainly by violent shaking. Many of those infants were in shock and epileptic status on admission. Retinal, subarachnoidal, and later subdural bleedings were recognizable. At first, all patients survived, but later 3 of them died in a vegetative state. Retinal bleedings are prompted by subarachnoidal hemorrhage due to shearing of bridging veins and by compression of the chest which immediately is followed by raise of venous pressure in the upper half of the body and by arteriospasms, leading to endothelial damage and increase of vascular permeability (Purtscher's disease). Both mechanisms result in severe retinal hemorrhage which might intrude into the vitreous body (Terson-syndrome). The consequences of violent shaking for the child might be disastrous mental retardation, microcephaly, spasticity, and epilepsies. The child might turn blind on one or both eyes; the visual failure is due to retinal scar formation, retinal detachment and fibrous organisation within the vitreous body on the one hand, due to raised intracranial pressure on the other hand, adding further damage to the visual pathway. In 19 children whose mean age was 13 months massive impact on the skull resulted in major brain damage: acute subdural hematoma, contusional bleedings, compound, diastatic or impression fractures. Ten of them died immediately or were picked up dead from home by different emergency services.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

    "abstract": "A twenty-year-old female, who had multi-agent chemotherapy for eighteen months after surgical resection of a choriocarcinoma originating from the left adnexa, was hospitalized because of a cerebrovascular accident. Her complaints were unconsciousness, generalized convulsion and left hemiparesis. Although both plain and contrast enhanced CT scans demonstrated only acute subdural hematoma in the right frontoparietal region associated with midline shift, no tumor shadow was recognized over the cortex or intraparenchymally. A carotid angiogram revealed a large and irregularly shaped aneurysm at a peripheral branching of the angular artery. Evacuation of the hematoma, resection of the aneurysm and revascularization for the defect of the parent artery by transplantation of a part of STA by means of microsurgical anastomosis were done at an emergency operation. Nevertheless the graft did not prove to be patent on the post-operative angiogram. Due to retrograde filling of the distal portion of the angular artery through collateral channels, the patient has been completely free of neurological deficit and her performance of daily activities has been excellent. No appearance of other intracranial metastasis of the tumor has been detected for six months thereafter. Histological examination of the resected aneurysm demonstrated that choriocarcinoma composed of cytotrophoblasts and syncitiotrophoblasts filled the lumen of the aneurysm. The van Gieson's staining clarified the invasion of the tumor into the vascular wall causing disruption of lamina elastica beneath the fairly intact adventitia. Microscopic findings of the specimens taken from adjacent brain tissue and overlying dura mater confirmed absence of metastatic lesion in them.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Eight months prior to admission, he had craniotomy for traumatic acute epidural hematoma on the left side. Following a coagulation of the middle meningeal artery which was the bleeding source, the dura was opened but no cortical damage was noted at that time. The computed tomographic (CT) scan on admission revealed a large subdural collection with a thin enhancing rim on the left side. Emergency craniotomy revealed a collection of subdural pus, which was irrigated and a catheter was put for continuous drainage. Postoperatively, the patient did well, however, following removal of the catheter, three weeks after the first operation, the subdural empyema was reexpanded with a very thick enhancing rim on CT scan. Ultrasonography also clearly demonstrated the formation of the thick membranes. The large craniotomy was performed and empyema with the outer and inner membranes of 8 mm thick was totally excised. Postoperative CT scan did not show any enhancing rim, indicating that enhancement was caused by newly formed vessels within the membranes per se. This findings are totally different from those observed in the brain abscess in which ring enhancement on CT continues months to years following so-called extracapsular excision of abscess. In the brain abscess, surrounding glial tissue with plenty neovascularization is left intact, even after the operation."

The series was limited to infants with acute subdural hematoma apparently due to minor head trauma without loss of consciousness, and not associated with cerebral contusion. Twenty-three of the patients were boys, and three were girls, showing a clear male predominance. The patients ranged in age between 3 and 13 months, with an average age of 8.1 months, the majority of patients being between 7 and 10 months old. Most of the patients were brought to the hospital because of generalized tonic convulsion which developed soon after minor head trauma, and all patients had retinal and preretinal hemorrhage. The cases were graded into mild, intermediate, and fulminant types, mainly on the basis of the level of consciousness and motor weakness. Treatment for fulminant cases was emergency craniotomy, and that for mild cases was subdural tapping alone. For intermediate cases, craniotomy or subdural tapping was selected according to the contents of the hematoma. The follow-up results included death in two cases, mild physical retardation in one case, and epilepsy in one case. The remaining 23 patients showed normal development. The relationship between computerized tomography (CT) findings and clinical grading was analyzed. Because some mild and intermediate cases could be missed on CT, the importance of noting the characteristic clinical course and of funduscopic examination is stressed."

The bony decompression with dural grafting seems successful in some patients, but surely enhances cerebral swelling and exacerbates edema in others. Whether the external or internal decompression could be justified is therefore a subject of controversy for the surgical treatment of choice. The authors, herein, proposed the new method with small craniectomy, 3 cm in diameter and irrigation with Nelaton's catheter for acute SDH with cerebral edema or swelling, that is the hematoma irrigation with trephination therapy (HITT) and performed it in 27 adult cases, 19 to 84 years of age (20 males and 7 females), who were transported within 24 hours after trauma and hospitalized in Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Tokyo Hospital during the period from January, 1982 to January, 1984, whose Glasgow coma scale points were 3 to 8 on admission, 16 cases (59%) of whom showed unilateral or bilateral absence of light reflex.

    "abstract": "Case I: A 9-year-old boy, diagnosed as having hemophilia A at 8 months, was admitted complaining of slight headache and nausea one day after a minor head trauma. Neurological deficits were absent but CT scan revealed an epidural hematoma in the posterior fossa. Shortly afterwards, he lapsed into coma with apnea and dilated pupils. Following resuscitation, emergency suboccipital craniectomy and total removal of the bilateral supra- and infratentorial extradural hematoma was performed under AHG administration. The patient gradually regained consciousness, but during the subsequent nine weeks he underwent three major operations (laparotomy): the first two for hemostasis of gastrointestinal bleeding, and the last one for strangulated intestinal obstruction. Although this patient necessitated 16 weeks of AHG administration, he was discharged without any side effects after 4 months of hospitalization. Case II: A 10-year-old boy, diagnosed earlier as having hemophilia A, experienced a minor head trauma and was admitted because of headaches and nausea. CT scan revealed an epidural hematoma in the posterior fossa. Removal of the hematoma was successfully completed under AHG administration. The patient was discharged without any neurological deficits. In the above hemophilic cases, we used a high concentrated AHG and maintained at 70% of the plasma concentration of the VIII factor during the first 14 postoperative days. The high concentrated AHG was safe for long term administration, so one should not hesitate operation even in the case of intracranial hemorrhage of hemophilic patients. CT scan should be recommended to the patient of hemophilia A even in minor head trauma."

    "abstract": "In the management of accident patients a physician must be able to recognize the life-threatening complications of craniocerebral trauma. Therefore, he must be well versed in the symptomatology of such complications and by a short neurological examination be able to find out the risk to the patient. Only in this way is it possible to decide whether the patient has to be merely observed or additional neuroradiological investigation is necessary, whether he has to be transferred to a neurosurgical department or in emergency cases be operated on immediately. In acute epidural hematoma, e.g., with signs of midbrain compression, an instantaneous trephination is imperative; therefore, a general surgeon, too, should have the ability to perform such an operation, the technique of which is described in the paper."

    "abstract": "The CT findings in a case of neonatal acute subdural hematoma are presented. CT demonstrated a crescentic high density area in the subdural space over the left cerebral hemisphere and an oval high density area in the left occipital region. The latter was suspected of being an intracerebral hematoma. Emergency craniotomy revealed that the high density area was due to a subdural hematoma between the occipital lobe and the tentorium cerebelli."

    "title": "Large decompressive craniotomy in the treatment of acute subdural hematoma.",
    "abstract": "A series of 42 patients who had large decompressive craniotomies for acute subdural hematoma has been reviewed with regard to long term results. Postoperative mortality (within 30 days of surgery) was 36%. Delayed but related deaths accounted for an additional 19% mortality, for a total mortality of 55%. Fourteen patients (33%) were able to return home, but there was a significant morbidity in terms of intellectual impairment, hemiparesis, and dysphasia. Recommended management includes establishment of an adequate airway, intravenous administration of mannitol, and performance of an emergency computerized tomographic (CT) scan before operation. A large decompressive craniotomy is performed, with removal of the blood clot, establishment of hemostasis, patch-grafting of the dura, and removal of the bone flap to allow the edematous, swollen brain to expand away from the brain stem. The mortality and morbidity will probably always remain high because in the majority of the cases significant structural damage to the cortical and brain stem structures occurs at the time of the injury."

    "abstract": "Since May 1975 was have been working in the field of C.A.T. and its application to study head injuries. We are presenting differents groups of patients studied by C.A.T. I. -- DATA OF C.A.T. IN THE CASES OF EMERGENCY AND IMMEDIATE POST-OPERATIVE FOLLOW-UP OF HEAD INJURIES A) EMERGENCY STATE As soon as the clinical state of an head injured patient was supposed to need an operation, C.A.T. was realized; so differents abnormal scanners may be observed: 1. epidural hematoma, 2. subdural hematoma, 3. intra-cerebral hematoma, 4. acute subdural hematoma or contusion. We must do some comments: -- The Emi-scanner is pre-eminent in showing the exact topography of the lesion : so, the flap is easier to realise. -- In most cases the Emi-scanner is easier to interpret than angiogram for example contusion and hematoma. We know the goods results in hematomas and the poors results in surgery of contusions. -- But the senior advantage of C.A.T. is to provide all the informations in the totality of skull content. Emi-scanner shows bilateral lesions, ipsilateral lesion. C.A.T. is pre-eminent in showing the presence of this two lesions, more accurately than senior methods of investigations, so C.A.T. permits emergency neurosurgical treatment. B) C.A.T. AND FOLLOW-UP Repeated studies at post-intervals can be accomplished without risk to the patient, thus making follow-up simpler and more effective to the neurosurgical attitude. C) POST-OPERATIVE CONTROL AND C.A.T. Post-operative complications are always hard to diagnosis. C.A.T. is painless, quick and safe, and easier to interpret than an angiogram. II -- SEQUELLAE STADE AND C.A.T. In this field certains advantages of C.A.T. are immediatly apparents. In most cases the C.A.T. is the best screening method. Patients carried out are: -- psychiatric troubles, -- post-traumatic epilepsy. The results are not reliable. There is no anatomical-clinical relation in most cases. Differents pictures are observed: -- asymetrical ventricle enlargment, -- global ventricule enlargment, -- partial cerebral atrophy. III -- DISCUSSION 1. We are at the beginning of our study. 2. This not always possible to obtain a C.A.T. in emergency for a head injury, especialy at night. 3. Patients investigated following head trauma are among the most difficult to study with C.A.T. These invididuals send to be restless and uncooperative. Numerous artefacts produced by patient motion may lead to erroneous negative or positive diagnosis, so general anesthesia is often helpful. It is hoped that as a more rapid scanners become available this problem will be obviated. The C.A.T. alone is not capable, to provide all the necessary date concerning head injury. The C.A.T. is, however, re-adjusting our total investigation (E.E.G., angiograms) philosophy and practice rather than replacing the standard neuroradiological technique, except, may be, with epidural hematoma."

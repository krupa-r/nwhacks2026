    "title": "Mortality Trends for Aortic Aneurysm Rupture in the United States, 1999-2020: A Population-Based Observational Study Using CDC WONDER.",
    "abstract": "Ruptured aortic aneurysm (rAA) is a life-threatening vascular emergency, often fatal before reaching medical care. Despite advances in screening, endovascular repair, and cardiovascular risk control, mortality from rAA remains high. This study aimed to evaluate national trends and disparities in rAA-related mortality among U.S. adults from 1999-2020. A retrospective population-based analysis was performed using CDC WONDER mortality data for adults aged ≥25 years. Deaths were identified using ICD-10 codes I71.1, I71.3, I71.5, and I71.8. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMR) per 100,000 were calculated using the 2000 U.S. standard population. Temporal trends were assessed with Joinpoint regression to estimate annual and average annual percent change (APC/AAPC) with 95% confidence intervals. RAA led to 118,211 deaths in the United States from 1999-2020. The overall AAMR was 2.50 per 100,000, declining from 4.87 in 1999 to 1.15 in 2020 (AAPC = -6.51%). Mortality was higher in men (3.70) than women (1.62), and in rural (3.04) compared to urban areas (2.37). NH Whites had the highest rates (2.74), while NH Asians showed the steepest decline (AAPC = -7.02%). Regionally, the Midwest recorded the highest AAMR (2.94), whereas the Northeast showed the fastest decline (AAPC = -6.83%). Mortality increased sharply with age, peaking in adults ≥85 years. The U.S. mortality due to rAA has decreased significantly over a period of twenty years, although the underlying factors for this decline cannot be determined from mortality data alone. Nevertheless, this reduction was not even, as women, older adults, and rural residents continue to face disproportionately higher mortality. Ongoing surveillance and targeted efforts to address disparities in access to care are needed to maintain and extend these gains."

    "title": "Predictors of early adverse events and remodeling after thoracic endovascular aortic repair for type B aortic dissection.",
    "abstract": "To identify factors associated with early adverse events and aortic remodeling following thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for type B aortic dissection (TBAD). A dual-center retrospective analysis was performed on 33 consecutive patients who underwent first-time TEVAR for acute and subacute TBAD between October 2022 and September 2024. Patients with residual or recurrent type A dissection, previous arch reconstruction, staged thoracoabdominal repair, in-situ fenestration, or candy-plug techniques were excluded. Demographics, procedural details, and outcomes were analyzed according to Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) reporting standards. Univariate analysis was used to identify predictors of adverse events, positive remodeling, reintervention, and mortality. Primary outcomes included technical success and 30-day results, while secondary outcomes encompassed follow-up remodeling, mortality, and reintervention. Technical success was achieved in 97% of cases. Thirty-day mortality and major adverse event (MAE) rates were 6% and 24%, respectively. At a mean follow-up of 13.8±7.2 months, positive aortic remodeling occurred in 73% of patients, and aortic-related reintervention in 21%. On univariate analysis, urgent presentation (P=0.008), complicated dissection (P=0.017), and higher body-mass index (P=0.028) predicted 30-day adverse events, whereas beta-blocker therapy was protective (P=0.034). Persistent false-lumen perfusion at completion, discharge, and six-month imaging was associated with reduced remodeling (P<0.05). Dyslipidemia and persistent false-lumen perfusion correlated with later reintervention. TEVAR for TBAD achieved high technical success and favourable mid-term outcomes. Urgent or complicated presentations predict early morbidity, whereas sustained false-lumen flow compromises remodeling and increases reintervention risk. Complete false-lumen exclusion and optimal medical therapy are essential for durable results."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection is a serious cardiovascular emergency that needs immediate attention. It is rare for aortic dissection to occur in twins, and there has been no prior report of it happening in a monozygotic twin within three days. We present the case of a 30-year-old man who presented to the emergency department after an episode of near syncope and was found to have concomitant aortic dissection with inferior myocardial infarction. This case is notable because the patient's twin brother had a repair of Stanford type A aortic dissection just three days prior. The patient underwent an emergent ascending aortic graft and coronary artery bypass graft surgery and recovered after a complex postoperative course. To the best of our knowledge, this is a rare case report of aortic dissection in a pair of twins that occurred within a three-day span, raising a special interest in a timed genetic mechanism for this occurrence. Additionally, this case highlights the importance of maintaining high suspicion of aortic dissection in the appropriate clinical context and in patients with a relevant family history."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) knows high mortality, with emergency surgery being the cornerstone of treatment. The GERAADA-score is advocated in guidelines to predict 30-day ATAAD surgical mortality. This study investigates its performance in a Dutch cohort, with an emphasis on malperfusion definitions, age groups and sex. Adults with ATAAD undergoing emergency surgery at five Dutch centres (2007-2024) were included in a multicentre database. External validation of the GERAADA-score was performed with this data, using discrimination (area under the curve(AUC)) and calibration (Brier score, Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and calibration plots). A logistic regression with GERAADA variables was fitted on the study populations and assumptions were checked. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on sex, age in deciles and malperfusion definitions (including imaging and clinical definitions). 1,146 patients underwent surgery for ATAAD. Observed early mortality was 16.9%(n = 194). Of 1,130 patients included in the external validation cohort, 92.2% had low-intermediate risk (GERAADA-score ≤ 30%). The GERAADA-score showed moderate discrimination (AUC 0.649(95% CI : 0.604-0.694)), with higher AUC for younger patients (50-59 years). The malperfusion definition including ischaemia confirmed by imaging showed the best discriminative power. Calibration was good (Hosmer-Lemeshow, p = 0.754). Logistic regression identified age, catecholamine use, ventilation support, and coronary and peripheral malperfusion as independent risk factors for 30-day mortality, with signs of multicollinearity between preoperative catecholamine use and resuscitation. In the Dutch-setting the GERAADA-score demonstrated moderate discriminative power and good calibration across relevant subgroups. Adaptations of the GERAADA-score, including conducting a haemodynamic instability variable, may be considered to avoid redundant predictions and boost reproducibility."

    "abstract": "To compare the predictive performance of the German Registry for Acute Aortic Dissection Type A (GERAADA) and new ARCH (Arch Reconstruction under Circulatory Arrest with Hypothermia) scores for in-hospital mortality in patients undergoing urgent surgery for acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD). Between January 2019 and June 2024, 192 patients were surgically treated for ATAAD at a single center. Scores were calculated and compared. Model performance was assessed by discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC), calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow test, calibration plots), and accuracy (Brier score, mean absolute error). Median age was 69 years (interquartal range IQR 59-77), and 50.5% were male. Median GERAADA risk score: 19.3% (IQR 11.7-29.6), actual in-hospital mortality: 14.8%. GERAADA score: AUC 0.791 (95% CI: 0.694-0.887), Brier score 0.118, Hosmer-Lemeshow p = 0.11. ARCH score: AUC 0.748 (95% CI: 0.641-0.856), Brier score 0.114, Hosmer-Lemeshow p = 0.17. The GERAADA score demonstrated more consistent calibration and slightly higher, not statistically significant, discrimination, while the ARCH score showed marginally better overall accuracy but underestimated mortality in higher-risk patients. This is the first validation of the ARCH score specifically in patients undergoing surgery for ATAAD. Both GERAADA and ARCH scores provide an acceptable prediction of early in-hospital mortality after ATAAD surgery. The GERAADA score achieved marginally higher, but statistically non-significant, discrimination, particularly in identifying high-risk patients, whereas the ARCH score provides slightly more accurate individual risk estimates but less effective separation of survivors from non-survivors."

    "abstract": "Surgery for Jehovah's Witness patients with Stanford type A aortic dissection (TAAD) carries a high surgical risk, and few reports have examined outcomes in this patient population. This study evaluated perioperative outcomes of surgery for TAAD in Jehovah's Witness patients. Eight Jehovah's Witness patients who underwent surgery for TAAD at our institution between February 2016 and January 2025 were retrospectively reviewed. No patients were receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy at the time of surgery. Preoperative characteristics, operative data, and postoperative outcomes were assessed. Emergency ascending aortic replacement was performed in 6 patients, while the 2 patients who underwent elective surgery due to a chronic course or thrombosed false lumen received total or partial arch replacement. Both elective cases received preoperative iron supplementation. The median postoperative nadir hemoglobin was 9.2 (interquartile range, 6.8-9.6) g/dL. One patient died, one was transferred to rehabilitation, and 6 patients (75.0%) were discharged home without major complications. Perioperative outcomes of surgery for TAAD in Jehovah's Witness patients were favorable. Proper surgical timing and preoperative management are essential to achieving satisfactory results. Further investigation with a larger cohort and longer follow-up is warranted."

    "abstract": "Acute Stanford type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a life-threatening cardiovascular emergency that demands prompt and accurate diagnosis due to a high associated mortality. Although imaging remains the diagnostic gold standard, the limited accessibility and time sensitivity of this technique underscore the need for reliable serum biomarkers. D-dimer is the most widely used biomarker, offering high sensitivity; however, the limited specificity of using D-dimer has prompted a search for novel biomarkers with greater diagnostic precision. Interestingly, proteoglycans (PGs) are essential constituents of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and have emerged as promising candidates for ATAAD, as PGs are released into the circulation during medial degradation, a defining histological feature of ATAAD. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that specific PGs exhibit favorable specificity and stability, potentially enabling distinction between ATAAD and other acute cardiovascular syndromes. Additionally, in contrast to D-dimer, which is rapidly cleared within 8 hours, certain PGs, such as aggrecan, remain stable for up to 72 hours, offering an advantage for detecting ATAAD in patients presenting beyond the early acute phase. This review summarizes the potential of aortic PGs as biomarkers of medial degeneration and circulating PGs as serum diagnostic markers of ATAAD. Future research is warranted to establish PGs as clinically reliable biomarkers, with the potential to enhance current diagnostic frameworks and support an earlier, more accurate identification of ATAAD."

    "abstract": "Objectives: Non-A Non-B (NANB) aortic dissections (ADs) are uncommon. Because of their rarity, their therapeutic pathway is not yet standardized, and anatomic or goal-directed treatments are not reported in current practices. We reviewed the treatment strategies of NANB AD across Europe, aiming to identify factors associated with increased mortality and the need for intervention, outlining optimal management pathways for future care. Methods: This multicentre cohort study was carried out in four European aortic centres, retrospectively including patients affected by NANB AD over the last 10 years. Patients' anatomical clinical and treatment data were collected with the aim of investigating the factors associated with their need for intervention and increased mortality, comparing the characteristics of those requiring surgery with those who responded to medical treatment alone. Results: Thirty-eight NANB patients (26, 68.4% men; mean age 60.6 ± 12.87) were included. The primary entry tear was identified in Ishimaru zone 1 or 2 in most cases (24, 63.2%) and the dissection extended distally to the ilio-femoral arteries in half of the patients (21, 55.3%). Surgical repair was indicated in 21 (55.3%) cases within 90 days of acute onset for end-organ ischemia, impending aortic rupture, or retrograde extension of the dissection (including 11 emergent/urgent operations), with most patients requiring surgery within 15 days of acute onset (17, 44.7%). The mean aortic diameter among patients requiring surgery was significantly higher in both zone 1 (7 37 IQR 3 versus 34 IQR 7, p = 0.043) and 2 (36 IQR 6 versus 32.5 IQR 7, p = 0.044) when compared with patients who underwent medical treatment alone. An increased in-hospital mortality rate was noted among patients with indication for surgery after medical treatment (0% versus 30.8%, p = 0.023). Conclusions: This cohort provides an additional description of clinical aspects and current practices in the treatment of NANB in Europe. Most patients of this series had an indication for surgery within two weeks of acute onset, demonstrating a frequently complicated course; moreover, this raises questions surrounding the most appropriate timing for interventional management. Although a diameter threshold was not identified, the baseline enlarged aortic diameter in zones 1 and 2 seemed to be associated with a need for early intervention. Further study is needed to fully refine the indications for treatment in NANB patients; this will support the study of the independent risk factors for increased mortality risk and complications among this group, and will allow the identification of subgroups of patients that may benefit from more aggressive treatment from acute onset."

    "title": "Transesophageal echocardiography in cardiac arrest: why, how, when, and where in clinical practice.",
    "abstract": "Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has emerged as a transformative tool in the management of cardiac arrest, offering significant advantages over traditional transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) by enabling continuous, high-resolution cardiac imaging during resuscitation. Initially used in operating rooms before 2000, TEE expanded into emergency departments (EDs), intensive care units (ICUs), and even prehospital settings. Its superior imaging capability during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) supports rapid diagnosis, optimization of compression quality, and more accurate rhythm assessment, including the differentiation between asystole and fine ventricular fibrillation. TEE has been shown to influence intra-arrest clinical decision-making in up to 78% of cases, often revealing pathologies-such as aortic dissection or cardiac rupture-not detected by TTE. Importantly, TEE aids in identifying reversible causes of cardiac arrest, guiding high-quality CPR by assessing left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, and shortening the duration of pulse checks. It also may play a role in extracorporeal CPR (ECPR) and organ donation procedures, particularly in cannulation and monitoring during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and normothermic regional perfusion (NRP). TEE use is feasible and safe during cardiac arrest, with high insertion success rates and minimal complications when performed by trained personnel. While cardiologists, anesthesiologists, and intensivists traditionally perform TEE, simplified training protocols now enable emergency physicians to safely and effectively deploy TEE in critical settings. Protocols such as \"POCUS-TEE\" may promote rapid acquisition of essential views, facilitating broader implementation. Despite the potential benefits, several barriers to widespread adoption remain. These include the availability of equipment, limitations in training, and concerns regarding the safety of the probe during defibrillation. Resuscitation guidelines recommend removing the transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) probe, or at least insulating it, as a precaution during defibrillation. TEE is particularly valuable when TTE proves inadequate, such as in obese or mechanically ventilated patients. In conclusion, TEE might enhance the quality and precision of resuscitation in cardiac arrest and has the potential to improve survival and neurological outcomes in selected cases. Its broader adoption hinges on institutional support, streamlined protocols, operator training, and further research to validate its impact on patient-centered outcomes. As technology advances and clinical integration improves, TEE may become a cornerstone of advanced life support in both in-hospital and out-of-hospital settings."

    "title": "Clinical efficacy and mechanisms of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation targeting the gut-brain axis for postoperative complications of aortic dissection: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.",
    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) is a life-threatening cardiovascular emergency characterized by rapid onset and high mortality. While surgery intervention, the primary treatment, improves short-term survival, it frequently leads to postoperative complications including systemic inflammatory response syndrome, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and anxiety/depression. These complications may be exacerbated by dysregulation of the gut-brain axis (GBA). Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique known to exert anti-inflammatory, prokinetic, and neuroregulatory effects in various conditions; however, its application for managing postoperative complications in AD remains unexplored. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of taVNS in regulating the GBA among postoperative AD patients through a randomized controlled trial. This is a single-center, randomized, investigator-blinded, sham-controlled randomized controlled trial. A total of 50 patients aged 18-75 years with postoperative Stanford Type A or B AD will be enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the active taVNS group or the sham control group. Both groups will receive standard postoperative care. The experimental group will additionally receive active taVNS targeting the vagus nerve-innervated auricular area (15 Hz, 200 μs pulse width), while the control group will receive sham stimulation at a non-vagus innervated site without electrical current. The intervention will be administered for 30 min, twice daily, over 7 consecutive days, with follow-up assessments continuing until 24 weeks post-surgery. Primary outcomes include changes in gut microbiota diversity/abundance and brain function (assessed via functional near-infrared spectroscopy). Secondary outcomes encompass inflammatory markers, plasma neurotransmitter levels, intestinal function recovery, and relevant psychometric scale scores. Safety will be monitored through vital signs, laboratory tests, and recording of any adverse events. This study is the first to innovatively integrate taVNS with the GBA theory, investigating its multi-target mechanisms through a comprehensive set of biomarkers and clinical endpoints. If proven effective, taVNS could offer a safe and cost-effective non-pharmacological adjunctive therapy for managing postoperative complications in AD. Furthermore, the findings have the potential to elucidate the role of the GBA in the recovery trajectory of patients following major cardiovascular surgery.

This study focuses on elucidating the multi-target and multi-pathway mechanisms through which morusin mitigates aortic dissection progression, integrating network pharmacology, single-cell transcriptomics and experimental validation. Multi-database analysis identified 281 morusin targets and 1741 ad-related genes, with 84 overlaps. Enrichment analyses highlighted IL-17, HIF-1 and MAPK signalling pathways as potential regulatory hubs. Protein-protein interaction network analysis identified seven key targets, all showing high binding affinity to morusin in molecular docking. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed cell-type-specific dysregulation, notably MAPK8 upregulation in fibroblasts and immune cells. In vitro, morusin dose-dependently inhibited AngII-induced vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and modulated IL-17 pathway gene expression. In vivo, morusin attenuated aortic dilation and reduced morbidity and mortality in a BAPN-induced AD mouse model. These findings suggest that morusin mitigates AD progression by targeting key inflammatory and apoptotic pathways, supporting its potential as a multi-target therapeutic candidate."

    "abstract": "Acute Type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) remains a surgical emergency with high morbidity and mortality despite improvements in operative management. The influence of age on outcomes among patients undergoing surgical repair remains incompletely characterized. Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2010-2018, 2020), we identified adult hospitalizations with a primary diagnosis of ATAAD who underwent surgical repair. Patients were stratified into three age groups (<65, 66-75, and >75 years). Weighted analyses compared demographics, comorbidities, hospital characteristics, and outcomes across groups. Multivariable logistic regression identified independent predictors of in-hospital mortality, adjusting for comorbidities and hospital factors. Among 32,798 weighted admissions, 48.1% were aged <65 years, 23.3% were 66-75 years, and 28.6% were >75 years (median age 65 years). Overall, in-hospital mortality was 11.9%, increasing from 8.9% in younger patients to 17.1% in those >75 years (p<0.001). Older adults had greater comorbidity burden (with most comorbidities differing significantly), shorter median length of stay (5 vs 6 days, p<0.001), and lower total hospital charges (p<0.001). On multivariable analysis, age remained an independent predictor of mortality in patients 66-75 years old (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.34-1.63; p<0.001) and in patients > 75 years (OR 2.29, 95% CI 2.10-2.5; p<0.001). Larger hospitals demonstrated modestly higher adjusted mortality, while hospital teaching status was not independently associated with outcomes. Advancing age substantially increases in-hospital mortality after ATAAD repair. These findings emphasize the need for individualized operative decision-making, early referral to experienced centers, and system-level strategies to optimize outcomes for older adults with ATAAD."

    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) remains a life-threatening condition requiring prompt surgical management. Over the last decades, improvements in diagnosis, surgical techniques, and perioperative care have influenced patient characteristics and outcomes. This study analyzes temporal trends in the clinical profiles and results of patients surgically treated for acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) in a Northern Italian region over a fifteen-year period. Materials and Methods: All consecutive patients undergoing emergency surgery for acute Stanford type A aortic dissection or acute intramural hematoma (IMH) between January 2010 and December 2024 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with chronic penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer or traumatic etiology were excluded. Demographic, clinical, and perioperative variables were analyzed to assess temporal changes. Trends were evaluated using linear regression and Cochran-Armitage tests for trend. Results: A total of 427 patients underwent surgery for AAD during the study period. The proportion of patients presenting with preoperative intubation significantly decreased over time (p for trend < 0.05), as did the incidence of preoperative shock (p for trend < 0.001). Conversely, the mean EuroSCORE showed a non-significant increase over the years. No significant differences were observed in age or other baseline parameters. A non-significant but progressive increase in female representation was observed over time (p = 0.064). Given this observation, a sex-based subanalysis was performed: women were significantly older (p < 0.001) and presented with higher EuroSCORE values (p < 0.001) compared to men, yet postoperative mortality was similar between sexes. This finding contrasts with recent reports suggesting worse outcomes among female patients. Conclusions: Over fifteen years, patients undergoing surgery for acute type A aortic dissection have shown decreasing rates of preoperative critical conditions, reflecting earlier diagnosis and improved management. Despite higher operative risk scores, women demonstrated comparable short-term survival to men within our regional program. Multivariable analysis showed that sex was dependently associated with in-hospital mortality."

    "abstract": "The frozen elephant trunk (FET) technique during total arch replacement (TAR) in patients with acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) has been shown to promote favorable aortic remodeling. However, few reports have compared the morphological assessments between the conventional elephant trunk (CET) and FET procedures. Here, we investigated whether the FET technique during TAR for the patients with ATAAD could affect aortic remodeling through morphological analysis. In total, 464 patients diagnosed with ATAAD underwent emergency ascending aorta or TAR between 2010 and 2023. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 28 patients who underwent TAR and postoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography. We assigned 28 patients to either the CET group (n = 11) or FET group (n = 17). Patient characteristics, postoperative outcomes, and aortic remodeling analysis were collected. Aortic remodeling analysis showed that the expansion rate of the true lumen (TL) in the descending thoracic aorta was significantly greater in the FET group early and 1 year after surgery. Meanwhile, the shrinkage rate of the false lumen (FL) in the descending thoracic aorta was significantly greater in the FET group early after surgery and tended to be greater in the FET group even 1 year after surgery. Remarkably, the incidence of reintervention of the descending aorta was significantly lower in the FET group. The FET technique with TAR in patients with ATAAD could improve aortic remodeling through improved TL expansion and preventive FL dilatation in the descending thoracic aorta and reduce the need for surgical reintervention."

Traditional axillary artery cannulation carries risks of brachial plexus injury and inadequate perfusion.

We retrospectively analyzed data from 94 consecutive ATAAD surgical patients between May 2024 and May 2025. All patients underwent hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA) combined with antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP). Perfusion was established via end-to-side anastomosis of a 10-mm straight artificial vascular graft to the innominate artery, through which both systemic arterial perfusion and ACP were conducted. In-hospital mortality was 14.89%. Mean operative times included cardiopulmonary bypass (171.27 ± 43.65 min) and circulatory arrest (25 min). Complications included stroke (10.64%), tracheostomy (17.02%), and acute kidney injury (23.40%). No upper limb ischemia or vascular injuries occurred. The modified perfusion strategy utilizing innominate artery anastomosis with an artificial vascular graft is a safe, effective, and technically reliable method. It provides excellent cerebral perfusion, unobstructed surgical visibility, and avoids upper limb ischemic complications, making it worthy of clinical promotion."

    "title": "Isolated Neck Pain as an Atypical Manifestation of Type A Acute Aortic Dissection: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a life-threatening cardiovascular emergency that is most commonly associated with severe chest or back pain. Atypical symptoms such as isolated neck pain may lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment, increasing the risk of mortality. In this report, we present a diagnostically challenging case of AAD with atypical symptoms in order to increase clinical awareness and support earlier recognition of such presentations. CASE REPORT A 30-year-old man with obesity, a 10-pack-year smoking history, arterial hypertension, and a family history of AAD presented with isolated neck pain and a transient presyncopal episode following mild exertion. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis and elevated D-dimer, troponin, and NT-proBNP levels. Transthoracic echocardiography raised suspicion of Type A AAD, although the initial contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan did not confirm the diagnosis. Due to continued clinical concerns, CT scan was repeated, and it revealed a Stanford Type A dissection. The patient underwent emergency surgery involving the resection of the affected segment of the ascending aorta and graft replacement using a synthetic prosthesis. His postoperative course was uneventful, and he remained asymptomatic at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS This case report highlights isolated neck pain as an atypical but potentially critical presentation of Type A AAD. Early recognition of atypical features in high-risk patients is essential. Multimodal imaging is crucial for timely diagnosis and improved survival outcomes."

Our data suggest that tissue storage and genetic testing in the setting of suspected heritable thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (HTAAD) are underutilized. In this focussed review, we outline the genetic basis of HTAAD and the current guidelines regarding genetic testing. We present a case series demonstrating both favourable and unfavourable genetic testing practices. We suggest potential improvements to current genetic testing algorithms, such as increased involvement of medical examiners and emergency department clinicians, to help identify patients and families suitable for genetic testing. Additionally, we provide a description of the pathophysiology underlying inheritable aortopathies."

    "title": "Predictive Value of MELD Score and Charlson Comorbidity Index in Thoracic Aortic Surgery Patients.",
    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) carry a high risk of fatal rupture, necessitating improved preoperative risk stratification. This study evaluates the predictive value of systemic risk scores-specifically the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)-for in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and one-year mortality in patients undergoing elective ascending aortic surgery. The study further compares MELD variants (MELD-Na and MELD-XI) for their prognostic performance in this context. This retrospective single-center study analyzed digital medical records of 500 patients undergoing elective surgery for ascending thoracic aortic disease between 2003 and 2023. MELD, MELD-Na (incorporating sodium), and MELD-XI (excluding INR for anticoagulated patients) were calculated from preoperative laboratory data. The CCI was derived from documented comorbidities. Outcomes included in-hospital mortality, length of stay (from admission to discharge), and one-year mortality assessed via outpatient follow-up. The study excluded patients undergoing emergency surgery for Stanford type A aortic dissection. MELD-Na incorporates serum sodium, while MELD-XI is a variant that excludes INR for patients with anticoagulation. The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was derived from patients' medical histories prior to surgery. Length of stay was defined as total inpatient days between admission and discharge. One-year mortality was assessed via outpatient follow-up data. Loss to follow-up did not exceed 30%. Of 500 patients (median age 64 years, 72.8% male), the MELD-Na score showed the strongest ability to predict in-hospital mortality (AUC = 0.698), outperforming both the standard MELD (AUC = 0.690) and the age-adjusted CCI (AUC = 0.631). For one-year mortality (N = 355), MELD-Na again performed best (AUC = 0.732), while the unadjusted CCI showed minimal predictive value (AUC = 0.509). Predictive power for hospital length of stay was limited across all scores; the age-adjusted CCI achieved the highest, though modest, discrimination (AUC = 0.627). 1-year mortality was assessed in 355 patients with available follow-up data (29.0% lost to follow-up). Among these, non-survivors had significantly higher MELD scores (p < 0.001). MELD-Na demonstrated the strongest predictive performance (AUC = 0.732). The MELD score, particularly MELD-Na, demonstrated strong predictive ability for in-hospital and 1-year mortality, but showed limited value in estimating hospital stay duration. MELD-Na and the age-adjusted CCI provide valuable preoperative prognostic information for patients undergoing elective ascending aortic surgery. While not intended to replace established risk models, their simplicity and reliance on routine clinical data make them attractive tools for early triage, especially in older or multimorbid patients. Their integration into preoperative planning may enhance individualized risk assessment and resource allocation."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is a life-threatening vascular emergency, typically associated with hypertension, connective tissue disease, or stimulant drug use. Ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic with sympathomimetic properties, is rarely implicated in major cardiovascular events. This case report describes a 57-year-old woman with no known medical history who presented with acute altered mental status after reported intranasal ketamine use and subsequent back pain. On arrival, she was obtunded and hypertensive, requiring intubation for airway protection. CT angiography revealed a Type A aortic dissection extending from the root to the left iliac artery with involvement of the carotid, mesenteric, and renal vessels. Despite initial conservative management and later surgical intervention, the patient suffered intraoperative cardiac arrest and was pronounced deceased. This case highlights the potential for ketamine-induced sympathomimetic effects to precipitate vascular catastrophe in susceptible individuals."

    "abstract": "Behçet's syndrome (BS) is a rare, chronic multisystem inflammatory disorder that can lead to severe cardiovascular complications. Among these, aortic pseudoaneurysms are infrequent and associated with high mortality due to their risk of rupture. The diagnosis of BS remains challenging due to its variable clinical presentation and the absence of specific biomarkers, particularly when the initial presentation is atypical. We present the case of a 32-year-old former professional football player who presented with severe aortic regurgitation with heart failure due to a pseudoaneurysm of the ascending aorta. Initial suspicion of infective endocarditis and aortic dissection was excluded after a clinical, microbiological, and imaging assessment. Emergent Bentall procedure was successfully performed. Subsequently, typical clinical features, including recurrent oral ulcers, pseudofolliculitis, and superficial venous thrombophlebitis, led to the diagnosis of BS. The patient received systemic immunosuppressive therapy combining corticosteroids and infliximab. At 8-month follow-up, echocardiography demonstrated normalization of left ventricular function and no recurrence or new vascular involvement. The case highlights the importance of considering BS in the differential diagnosis of young patients presenting with acute aortic disease. Aortic involvement in BS, although rare, can lead to severe complications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a pseudoaneurysm of the aortic root as the initial manifestation of BS. Rapid surgical intervention followed by appropriate medical therapy led to a favourable outcome. Recognizing BS as a potential cause of acute presentations of ascending aortic disease may ensure early and effective management."

    "abstract": "There are few reports of time effect for postoperative outcomes in patients with acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) complicated by malperfusion syndrome (MPS), especially transfer time difference from diagnosis to operation room (OR). To elucidate whether time between diagnosis and OR might be a significant factor, this study evaluated surgical outcomes of ATAAD complicated by MPS. Between October 2013 and June 2024, 159 patients with ATAAD underwent emergent aortic repair; 54.7% (87/159) presented with MPS, 45.3% (72/159) without MPS. Of 87 patients with MPS, 69.0% (60/87) were transferred to the OR within 150 minutes from initial diagnosis (immediate repair), whereas 31.0% (27/87) were transferred to the OR after 150 minutes (late repair). In the MPS group, there was a significant difference in 30-day mortality rate between immediate and late repair, 20.0% (12/60) vs 48.1% (13/27; P < .01). Mean follow-up time was 33.0 ± 35.8 months. Cumulative survival rate in 5 years of patients with MPS was 64.6% for immediate repair and 46.1% for late repair. A significant difference was noted in long-term outcome between the groups (P = .03), whereas there was no difference in the non-MPS group (P = .11). On multivariable Cox regression analysis, age >65 years, cardiac tamponade, and late aortic repair were associated with increased long-term mortality (P = .02, .02, and <.01). Immediate transfer from diagnosis to OR significantly improved long-term outcome in patients with ATAAD complicated by MPS. Older age and preoperative cardiac tamponade worsened long-term mortality in this cohort."

    "abstract": "To determine the prevalence of patient decision delay in aortic dissection and identify its associated factors, representing the first application of the Self-Regulatory Model as a guiding theoretical framework. A total of 386 patients with aortic dissection were enrolled in this single-center, cross-sectional study. Participants were recruited from the emergency department of a tertiary cardiovascular hospital in China, using a convenience sampling methodology. Data were collected using the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire, the Perceived Barriers to Healthcare-Seeking Decision Scale, and the Social Support Rating Scale. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with patient decision delay. The prevalence of patient decision delay in this study was 67.88% (95% CI: 63.22% - 72.54%). Logistic regression analysis identified several potential factors associated with this delay, including education level, presence of bystanders at symptom onset, Stanford classification, and pain severity. Symptoms such as back pain, abdominal pain, profuse perspiration, and persistent unrelieved pain were also significant. Furthermore, perceived barriers and illness perception were found to be linked to decision delay. Decision delay is a prevalent issue among aortic dissection patients, necessitating targeted interventions. The study confirms that patient decision delay is driven by clinical factors and, crucially, by modifiable factors within the Self-Regulatory Model, such as negative illness perceptions and heightened perceived barriers. Interventions targeting these cognitive and psychosocial barriers are imperative for improving outcomes."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD), which is a lethal cardiovascular emergency, lacks effective pharmacological interventions. The pathogenesis of AD is complex, and the loss of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is considered to be a key pathological feature. Regulated cell death (RCD) is an important pathway leading to SMC loss. Ferroptosis, which is a novel type of RCD, is characterized by an abnormal accumulation of lipid peroxides. However, the specific mechanism of ferroptosis in the occurrence and development of AD has not been fully elucidated. This study examined ferroptosis in AD progression and assessed anti-ferroptosis treatment. Human AD tissues were analyzed for ferroptosis markers. An AD mouse model was induced using β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) and angiotensin II (Ang II), followed by UAMC-3203 administration to inhibit ferroptosis. Human aortic vascular SMCs (HAVSMCs) were used to investigate UAMC-3203's mechanism. We demonstrated that ferroptosis was involved in the development of human AD through the upregulation of HMOX1 and 4-HNE, as well as the downregulation of GPX4 and FSP1. The involvement of ferroptosis in the entire AD process in AD mice was confirmed by the stage-specific upregulation of Hmox1 and downregulation of Gpx4, as well as by time-specific substitution. The inhibition of ferroptosis expression with UAMC-3203 reduced AD morbidity and mortality, maintained aortic structural integrity, caused the alignment of elastic fibers, and reduced collagen deposition. Mechanistically, UAMC-3203 attenuated SMC death and loss by inhibiting lipid peroxidation. Our result provides new information on the role of ferroptosis in AD progression from an antiferroptosis perspective."

    "abstract": "Optimal management of uncomplicated type B aortic dissection (uTBAD) remains debated. While thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) promotes false lumen thrombosis (FLT) and remodelling, the early clinical profile and long-term benefits in routine practice need further investigation. The pre-trial setup of the European Uncomplicated Type B Aortic Repair (EU-TBAR) programme prospectively collated multicentre outcomes to evaluate real-world clinical outcomes of TEVAR for uTBAD across European centres, and to identify independent predictors of mortality, reintervention, and aortic remodelling to inform the design of a definitive randomised EU-TBAR trial. Multicentre observational cohort of consecutive patients undergoing TEVAR for uTBAD and related descending thoracic pathology across European centres. Standardised eCRFs captured demographics, presentation, imaging, procedural details, and outcomes. Primary outcomes were in-hospital and follow-up mortality; secondary outcomes included complications, reintervention, and aortic remodelling. Multivariable logistic regression identified predictors of mortality, reintervention, and remodelling. We analysed 263 patients (mean age 61.4±13.4 years; 79.5% male) from six countries. In-hospital mortality was 9.9%, and mortality during follow-up was 14.1% (median follow-up time ≈ 1 year). Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) was the strongest independent predictor of death (OR 9.93, p < 0.0001); additional predictors included AKI at presentation (OR 4.24, p = 0.012), syncope (OR 3.15, p < 0.0001), and ventilation for >48 hours (OR 2.69, p = 0.024). Higher haemoglobin (OR 0.74 per g/dL, p<0.0001) and eGFR (OR 0.79 per 10 units, p<0.0001) were protective; reintervention was associated with lower mortality (OR 0.26, p=0.013). Reintervention occurred in 18.3% at a median of 168 days; discharge endoleak (present in 18.3%) tripled reintervention odds (OR 3.08, p=0.003). Imaging at discharge and follow-up was performed in 70.7% and 63.9%, respectively. At follow-up, FLT was complete in 42.1% and partial in 39.3%. Remodelling was associated with beta-blockers (descending aorta OR 3.58, p=0.009), prior thoracic surgery (suprarenal OR 5.47; infrarenal OR 8.33; both p=0.008), and targeted branch stenting (e.g., coeliac OR 31.0, p=0.016). Female sex independently predicted FLT (OR 11.53, p=0.022). Survival was lower for emergent cases (65% vs 79-78%; p=0.039) and in patients with postoperative AKI (36% vs 86%; p<0.001). This pre-trial setup and analysis successfully confirm the feasibility and methodological foundation for the definitive EU-TBAR trial. There is a clinical equipoise across European centres, with significant practice variation justifying a randomised trial comparing pre-emptive TEVAR versus medical management for uTBAD. Key mortality predictors provide objective criteria for patient selection, while the reintervention rate establishes important trial endpoints."

Patients with connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome may be at higher risk for arytenoid dislocation due to tissue laxity. A woman in the 50s with Marfan syndrome underwent emergent total arch replacement for Type A aortic dissection. On endotracheal extubation, she was noted to have stridor. Fibreoptic examination was notable for an immobile right arytenoid. This case highlights the risk of arytenoid dislocation following endotracheal intubation in patients with connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome. Conservative therapy can result in complete recovery without surgery. Furthermore, this case demonstrates that subsequent endotracheal intubations can be performed safely with proper airway planning. Increased awareness and further reporting are needed to understand and mitigate the risk in this vulnerable population."

The semi-model consisted of six clinical characteristics (age, heart rate, pulse pressure, temperature, hypertension, diabetes), with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.792 and 0.823 in the training and validation sets. The whole-model included five clinical characteristics (age, pulse pressure, hypertension, diabetes) and two point-of-care test data (high sensitivity troponin I, D-dimer). It had a higher predictive value compared to the semi-model, with AUCs of 0.973 and 0.980 in the training and validation sets, respectively. Given the optimal cutoff point, the semi-model demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.716 and a specificity of 0.734, whereas the whole-model displayed a sensitivity of 0.930 and a specificity of 0.946.

A 57-year-old African American male with a history of hypertension, smoking, and substance use disorder presented with sudden-onset severe abdominal pain after 30 minutes of cocaine use. Imaging confirmed isolated celiac artery dissection following recent cocaine use. The patient was managed conservatively for spontaneous isolated celiac artery dissection. Spontaneous isolated celiac artery dissection, characterized by sudden-onset abdominal pain localized to the periumbilical and epigastric regions, is linked to various risk factors such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, smoking, fibromuscular dysplasia, and autoimmune disorders. Studies underscore male predominance, the distinctive nature of abdominal pain, and the efficacy of conservative management. Additionally, cocaine use has been associated with multiple vascular pathologies, including dissection. Although the occurrence of spontaneous isolated celiac artery dissection after cocaine use has not been reported, the timing of cocaine use and symptom onset is highly suggestive of the association. The use of more frequent imaging would likely uncover more cases. It is important to keep this condition on the differential when evaluating abdominal pain in patients with cocaine abuse."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the short- and medium-term results of TEVAR for descending thoracic aorta diseases in octogenarians' patients. In a single-center retrospective study, patients aged 80 years and older who underwent TEVAR for descending thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection between 2000 and 2021 were included. Demographic data, perioperative morbi-mortality, mortality risk factors, and anatomical results were analyzed using the latest available scanner during follow-up. In this study from 2000-2021, 35 octogenarians' patients (57% men, 43% women) underwent treatment for thoracic aortic pathologies, 74% were treated for aneurysm, 26% for aortic dissection and 34% required urgent surgery (10 ruptures, 2 malperfusions). Technical success was 100%, with 14.0% intra-hospital mortality (4 respiratory distress, 1 cardiac arrest). Morbidity rate was 42% (7 respiratory complications, 2 paraplegias, 2 strokes, 3 renal failures). After 14 months of follow-up, death rate was 20% (6/30). Aortic diameter analysis showed stable lesions in 69.2% (n=18), regression in 26.9% (n=7), and increased diameter in 3.8% (n=1). Type I endoleaks were observed in 8.6% (n=3), type 2 in 11.4% (n=4). Endovascular treatment of descending thoracic aortic pathologies in patients aged 80 and older carries higher risks.

Methods: Between January 2021 and January 2025, all consecutive patients undergoing emergent surgery for ATAAD and hybrid aortic arch repair using the AMDS from two centers were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic, intraoperative, and postoperative data were collected. Patients were stratified based on 30-day or in-hospital mortality. Survival analysis was performed for patients who survived hospital discharge. Radiological evaluation focused on the presence of distal anastomotic new entries (DANEs), false lumen thrombosis, and aortic remodeling on follow-up computed tomography angiography. A total of 46 patients (12 female, mean age 66.1 ± 13.8 years) were included in the study. Results: The 30-day or in-hospital mortality rate was 21.7% (10 patients). There were no significant differences in demographic variables between survivors and non-survivors. All patients underwent hemiarch replacement with AMDS stent placement, with 54.3% also requiring aortic root replacement. Median cross-clamp time, hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA) time, and time of antegrade selective cerebral perfusion did not differ significantly between the two groups. However, significant differences were observed in median cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time (151 vs. 274 min, p = 0.02) and HCA temperature (27 °C vs. 25 °C, p = 0.021). Postoperatively, the non-survivor group showed a significantly higher incidence of dialysis requirement (7.7% vs. 60.0%, p = 0.02), use of mechanical circulatory support (3.9% vs. 44.4%, p = 0.01), and re-exploration for bleeding (15.4% vs. 66.7%, p = 0.023). Conclusions: The AMDS® is an effective adjunct in hemiarch replacement for ATAAD. Moderate hypothermia and optimized perfusion were linked to better early survival, while the device reliably promoted true-lumen expansion with few DANEs. Its rapid deployment may further facilitate the use of moderate hypothermia by balancing procedural efficiency with systemic protection."

We report the complex management of a 49-year-old man who developed an iatrogenic type A aortic dissection (iTAAD) after failed percutaneous coronary intervention. Initial stabilization with an Impella device was complicated by vascular injury and hemodynamic instability, requiring escalation to advanced MCS. As the iTAAD remained stable without systemic malperfusion, conservative management was chosen. Persistent severe left ventricular dysfunction prevented recovery, leading to implantation of a durable left ventricular assist device. Unlike spontaneous dissections, iTAADs arise from focal procedural injury, and-without malperfusion-may be safely managed conservatively, although no formal guidelines exist. In selected patients with stable iTAAD and cardiogenic shock due to concomitant myocardial infarction, a \"watchful waiting\" strategy combined with MCS can safely bridge to durable left ventricular assist device implantation."

In situ laser-assisted fenestration allows for LSA revascularization in both elective and urgent settings, yet its safety and efficacy lack robust multicenter data. LLTEVAR (LSA Revascularization With Laser-Assisted Fenestration During TEVAR) was a prospective, single-arm, multicenter study that enrolled patients with acute complicated or high-risk acute TBAD. The primary safety end point was freedom from composite MAEs (mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, paraplegia, type Ia endoleak, and retrograde aortic dissection/intramural hematoma) within 30 days after the procedure. Univariate and multivariable analyses identified risk factors for composite MAEs. A total of 100 patients (mean age, 60.5±12.6 years) were enrolled at 5 vascular centers between July 2018 and September 2021. The technical success rate of LSA fenestration was 98.0% (98/100). The 30-day primary safety end point was 86.0%. Complicated TBAD (OR, 4.04; 95% CI, 1.05-15.59; P=0.04) and type II/III aortic arch (OR, 4.61; 95% CI, 1.18-17.95; P=0.03) were significantly associated with a higher risk of composite MAEs within 30 days. In situ laser-assisted fenestration for LSA revascularization during TEVAR demonstrates favorable procedural success and acceptable short-term outcomes in patients with acute TBAD. However, periprocedural MAEs remain a critical consideration, particularly in those with complicated TBAD with type II/III aortic arch anatomy. Further studies with comparative groups and long-term follow-up are warranted to validate these outcomes. URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov; Unique Identifier: NCT03845829."

    "abstract": "Cerebral malperfusion is a devastating complication of acute type A aortic dissection that markedly increases perioperative mortality and morbidity. Despite central aortic repair with antegrade selective cerebral perfusion, insufficient reperfusion of the occluded carotid artery may lead to severe neurological injury. To overcome this limitation, we modified the conventional single-roller pump antegrade selective cerebral perfusion and introduced a 2-roller pump technique for direct carotid artery reperfusion during acute type A aortic dissection repair. Between January 2022 and December 2024, 112 patients underwent emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection at our institution. Of these, 15 (13.4%) presented with severe stenosis or occlusion of the common carotid artery and received direct common carotid artery reperfusion. Patients were divided into 2 groups: single-roller pump antegrade selective cerebral perfusion (n = 7) and 2-roller pump antegrade selective cerebral perfusion (n = 8). In the 2-roller pump technique, separate cerebral perfusion circuits were used for the malperfused carotid artery and the remaining neck vessels, allowing independent flow regulation. Baseline characteristics, operative parameters, and systemic outcomes were comparable between groups. No in-hospital deaths occurred in either group. Neurological deterioration was observed in 2 patients (28.6%) in the single-roller pump group, whereas no patient worsened in the 2-roller pump group. All symptomatic patients in the 2-pump group showed postoperative neurological improvement. No complications related to carotid exposure or 2-pump perfusion were identified. The 2-roller pump technique provides reliable perfusion to both dissected and unaffected neck vessels, potentially reducing the risk of cerebral ischemia. This strategy is safe and feasible, and may improve neurological outcomes in patients with acute type A aortic dissection and carotid malperfusion."

    "abstract": "Iatrogenic aortic dissection (IAD) is an extremely rare complication of coronary angiography, most often occurring during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and typically resulting from retrograde extension of a coronary artery dissection. The coexistence of IAD with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) presents significant management challenges, with no established guidelines to guide therapy. Management decisions are influenced by several factors, including whether angiography is performed in the setting of stable angina versus ACS, the extent of ischemic myocardium at risk, the patient's hemodynamic stability, and the extent of aortic involvement - particularly whether the dissection is confined to the aortic root or extends into the ascending aorta by less than or greater than 4 cm. Treatment strategies may include PCI alone for the coronary dissection or urgent surgical repair of the aorta with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The role of off-pump CABG in this context remains poorly defined. We describe a unique case of a patient with severe mid-left anterior descending (LAD) artery disease presenting with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), who developed a type II IAD during diagnostic coronary angiography without associated coronary artery dissection. Prompt recognition, careful imaging with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and computed tomography angiography (CTA), and immediate medical stabilization prevented progression of the dissection. This allowed for a successful and uncomplicated off-pump left internal mammary artery (LIMA) CABG to the LAD, resulting in excellent short- and long-term clinical outcomes."

    "title": "Acute aortic dissection-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome: pathogenesis and clinical implications.",
    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection, a life-threatening cardiovascular emergency, is frequently complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome. This complication exacerbates perioperative risks, poses challenges for clinical management, and impacts patient postoperative recovery. However, a comprehensive understanding of its pathogenesis remains elusive. This review synthesizes evidence to delineate aortic intimal tearing trigger the key initiating events comprising systemic inflammatory response, renin-angiotensin system dysregulation, high mobility group box 1 release, coagulation/fibrinolysis disorder, platelet hyperactivation/consumption, and intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury. These upstream pathways converge on the lung, inducing injury through sustained inflammation, damage to pulmonary vascular endothelium and alveolar type II epithelial cells, microvascular constriction, microthrombosis, and alveolar fibrin deposition. Notably, crosstalk among some of these pathways may amplify lung injury. By systematically presenting these mechanisms, this review highlights translational opportunities for early diagnosis, monitoring disease progression, and designing targeted therapies to mitigate lung injury and enhance outcomes in these patients."

    "title": "Acute type A aortic dissection rupture factors prediction using a hybrid ensemble model with feature selection and data augmentation.",
    "abstract": "Acute Type A Aortic Dissection (TAAD) is a life-threatening cardiovascular emergency, and early identification of high-risk patients for rupture is critical for optimizing surgical resource allocation. Existing studies predominantly focus on postoperative mortality prediction, lacking tools for in-hospital rupture risk assessment upon admission, with limitations including small sample sizes, feature redundancy, and single-algorithm bias. This study proposes an innovative framework integrating Boruta feature selection, Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN) for data augmentation, and Blending ensemble strategy to enhance predictive performance. Utilizing 200 original TAAD cases, CTGAN synthesized 900 high-fidelity samples. Key features (e.g., CKMB, lactate) were selected via Boruta, and a Blending ensemble model combining eight base models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) was developed. The model’s performance was evaluated using AUC, sensitivity, and F1-score. The Blending ensemble model achieved an AUC of 0.978, sensitivity of 0.920, and F1-score of 0.919, outperforming individual models. The study addresses small-sample constraints through CTGAN and leverages Blending to harness complementary strengths of diverse algorithms, providing a high-accuracy and interpretable tool for emergency triage. This framework fills the gap in TAAD rupture risk prediction and offers insights for clinical decision-making in resource-limited settings. The integration of Boruta feature selection, CTGAN data augmentation, and Blending ensemble strategy enhances model robustness and interpretability, making it a valuable tool for clinical applications."

    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic dissection (TAD), a lethal cardiovascular emergency, lacks effective pharmacological interventions. Endothelial dysfunction and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) deficiency drive TAD progression, but existing H2S donors exhibit uncontrolled release and cytotoxicity. Herein, we developed a GSH-responsive H2S-releasing polymer, named PSG12, using a gas-click polymerization strategy under mild conditions. PSG12 achieved tunable H2S release (4.27-fold higher at 2 mm than 0.5 mm GSH) and sustained plasma levels (more than 650 nm for 12 h post-injection). In TNF-α-challenged endothelial cells, PSG12 reduced the level of ROS (77% reduction), suppressed senescence (92.4% reduction), inhibited apoptosis (63% reduction), reduced inflammation (29.35% decrease in IL-1β protein expression), and preserved extracellular matrix (47.83% decrease in MMP-2 protein expression). In BAPN-induced TAD mice, PSG12 reduced aortic rupture (from 53.3% to 20.0%), improved survival (from 46.7% to 80.0%). On the one hand, PSG12 restored the homeostasis of endothelial cells in multiple dimensions; on the other hand, PSG12 maintained the concentration of plasma H2S. This precision gas therapy platform enables multi-pathway synergistic modulation for TAD."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection(aTAAD) complicated by mesenteric malperfusion (MMP) is associated with a high mortality rate due to bowel necrosis and subsequent multiorgan failure [(Yang B et al. in J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 158:675-687 e674, 2019), (Wang C et al. in Rev Cardiovasc Med 24:127, 2023)]. The optimal management strategy remains controversial, particularly regarding the timing and extent of bowel resection. Extensive resection can lead to short bowel syndrome, resulting in chronic intestinal failure and poor nutritional outcomes. Here, we present a case of aTAAD successfully managed with staged bowel resection guided by intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence angiography. A 29-year-old man presented with acute lower back pain and sensory deficits in both legs. He was diagnosed with acute type A aortic dissection and multiple malperfusions, including MMP. Emergency total aortic arch replacement with frozen elephant trunk was performed as central repair. Postoperatively, ischemic necrosis of the ascending colon was identified and resected, while the viability of the ileum remained uncertain. Intraoperative ICG fluorescence angiography confirmed adequate perfusion of the vasa recta, indicating reversible ischemia. To minimize unnecessary bowel resection, a second-look laparotomy surgery was performed 16 h later, leading to additional necrotic bowel resection. Ultimately, 180 cm of the ileum from the ligament of Treitz was preserved. The patient resumed oral intake approximately one month postoperatively and achieved full enteral independence by four months. This case highlights the importance of integrating ICG fluorescence angiography and staged bowel resection in the management of aTAAD with MMP. Early central repair, combined with real-time assessment of intestinal perfusion, enabled the preservation of intestinal length and improved postoperative outcomes. A strategic, stepwise approach is essential to optimizing bowel viability while maintaining hemodynamic stability in such critical situations."

    "abstract": "A minimalist approach to transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has accompanied the increase in TAVR procedures worldwide. Comprehensive evidence regarding the safety of non-anesthetist-led conscious sedation for TAVR is lacking. We aimed to evaluate the outcomes of patients undergoing TAVR with non-anesthetist-led conscious sedation. This retrospective analysis included consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous transfemoral TAVR with non-anesthetist-led conscious sedation, from March 2018 to 2025, in a single high-volume center. Thirty-day outcomes were assessed. Of 2854 patients who underwent TAVR, 2000 (70.1%) had non-anesthetist-led conscious sedation (age: 80.7 ± 6.5 years, 42.1% female). The annual proportion of non-anesthetist-led conscious sedation procedures increased from 37% (2018-2019) to 81% (2024-2025). Fentanyl was administered to 1986 (99.3%) patients (median: 75 mcg [IQR: 50-100]) and Midazolam to 945 (47.3%) patients (median: 1.5 mg [IQR: 1.0-2.0]). Mean procedural duration was 81.3 ± 67.7 min. Emergency anesthetic support was required for 53 (2.7%) patients, due to: vascular access complications (n = 15), cardiac arrest (n = 14), annular rupture/aortic dissection (n = 9), profound hypotension (n = 8), agitation (n = 4), ventricular perforation (n = 2) and reduced consciousness (stroke) (n = 1). Conversion to general anesthesia was required for 24 (1.2%) patients. Emergency bail-out surgery (cardiac/vascular) was undertaken in 15 patients (0.75%). Among the 2000 patients, 30-day mortality was 1.3%, and VARC-3 technical success, device success, and early safety were achieved in 97.2%, 92.7%, and 78.9% of patients, respectively. Non-anesthetist-led conscious sedation can be delivered safely in most patients undergoing percutaneous transfemoral TAVR. The need for emergency anesthetic support is low."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) is a life-threatening medical condition generally affecting those 65-75 years of age with poor outcome and various complications. It is urgent to investigate the pathogenesis of AD to explore novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for AD. Pathological vascular remodeling due to dysregulated proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) would promote AD development. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3B) could suppress VSMC proliferation and migration. However, the effect of GSK3B on VSMCs and the mechanism regulating GSK3B in AD remains unclear. Here, circRNA and miRNA profiles in aortic tissues were identified by RNA sequencing, human VSMCs were treated with angiotensin II (AngII) to established AD model in vitro, and the regulatory network among circular RNA (circRNA), microRNA (miRNA) and mRNA was determined by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Our results revealed that circUBE4B was downregulated in aortic tissues of AD patients and AngII-treated VSMCs. Besides, circUBE4B and GSK3B were decreased yet miR-199a-5p was increased in AngII-treated VSMCs. Moreover, circUBE4B increased GSK3B level by targeting miR-199a-5p in VSMCs. In addition, circUBE4B attenuated AngII-induced VSMC proliferation and migration through GSK3B by sponging miR-199a-5p. In summary, these findings might provide novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for AD."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) is a cardiovascular emergency with high mortality and poor prognosis. This study aimed to identify hub genes associated AD and to assess their predictive efficacy in AD occurrence and their potential biological roles. Gene microarray data were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The mRNA data of ascending aortic tissues from AD and control groups were analyzed for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by three methods: DESeq2, limma and edgeR. Additionally, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed, and the intersection genes identified by the former methods were considered candidate hub genes for AD. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) methods were utilized to explore the potential biological functions of these candidate hub genes. The top 10 hub genes and significant co-expression genes were identified using a protein-protein interaction network and Cytoscape software. Furthermore, the potential causal relationship between the most significant hub gene and AD was analyzed by Mendelian randomization method. A total of 1162 DEGs for AD were identified using DESeq2, limma, and edgeR methods. WGCNA clustered AD-related genes into 15 modules. The most relevant modules of AD were intersected with DEGs, resulting in the identification of 201 candidate hub genes. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that these genes were primarily associated with hypoxia, inflammation, cell death, and extracellular matrix (ECM) regulation. The top 10 hub genes for AD were identified as PAI-1, MMP14, ITGA5, CCL2, ITGB3, THBS2, COL18A1, CD68, NFKBIA, and PLAUR. PAI-1 was significantly co-expressed with MMP14, ITGA5, CCL2, and THBS2 in AD. A significant positive correlation between PAI-1 and AD risk was found using inverse variance weighted method (OR = 1.086; 95% CI = 1.006–1.173; P = 0.034). AD patients exhibit significant alterations in gene expression. PAI-1 might serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for AD by regulating processes such as hypoxia, inflammation, cell death, and degradation of the ECM.

Spinal magnetic resonance imaging revealed anterior signal abnormality T8 down to conus medullaris, terminating at L1 compatible with SCI. T9-T10 moderate spinal stenosis, along with degenerative changes L5-S1, was seen. Abdominal CT angiography revealed no signs of aortic dissection and no evidence of intestinal ischemia. He was treated with gabapentin for neuropathic abdominal pain and aspirin. This case represents an uncommon presentation of exertion-induced SCI.

    "abstract": "Acute aortic syndrome (AAS) is a life-threatening condition reported as often misdiagnosed. Advancements in CT availability and diagnostic algorithms, including high-sensitivity troponin and D-dimer for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and pulmonary embolism (PE), may reduce AAS misdiagnosis, but the impact remains unclear. This study evaluated the incidence, characteristics, and clinical features of missed AAS diagnoses in Swedish emergency departments (EDs) compared with those identified during initial ED visit. A retrospective observational study was conducted on 630,275 ED visits in Region Skåne, Sweden, from 2017 to 2018. Cases of AAS diagnosed within 30 days were identified via national registers. Clinical features, imaging, ECG findings, blood tests, outcomes, and time of diagnosis were reviewed. Missed diagnosis was defined as AAS not identified in the ED, with the patient being either discharged or admitted without imaging to detect AAS. Aortic dissection detection risk score (ADD-RS) combined with D-dimer levels were also retrospectively calculated. Among 98 confirmed AAS cases, 82 were diagnosed during the initial ED visit, whereas 16 (16%; 95% CI: 9.6–25.1%) were initially missed, with 2 discharged from the ED. Patients with missed AAS diagnoses were more likely to present with ST elevation/depression than were those diagnosed during the initial ED visit (43% vs. 15%, p = 0.01). ACS was the initial working diagnosis in 7 of 16 of the missed cases. The median time to diagnosis was significantly longer in missed cases (19 h [2–192] vs. 2 h [0.5–11.6], p < 0.001). Missed cases had higher 30-day (25% vs. 16%) and 90-day mortality rates (38% vs. 18%), although these differences were not statistically significant. In 55 of the 59 AAS patients, the ADD-RS plus D-dimer algorithm recommended CT of the aorta (93% sensitivity). Missed AAS remains a diagnostic challenge, with a miss rate of approximately one in six in Swedish EDs. Patients with missed AAS are more likely to present with ST changes and an initial suspicion of ACS. Given the overlap of symptoms, such as chest pain, with other critical conditions like ACS and PE, future ED diagnostic tools should be developed to predict multiple critical diagnoses concurrently."

    "title": "What Echocardiographic Findings Suggest Acute Type A Aortic Dissection?",
    "abstract": "An acute Stanford Type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) carries a high in-hospital mortality rate that increases with delays to surgical intervention. Early diagnosis is therefore critical for improving outcomes. Unfortunately, ATAAD is often misdiagnosed initially. Moreover, definitive diagnosis with computed tomography angiography (CTA) requires time to obtain and may not be feasible in an unstable patient. Fortunately, emergency physicians can use transthoracic cardiac point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) to make a quicker diagnosis, prompt earlier CTA, initiate goal-directed therapy, and reduce time-to-operative intervention. This narrative review reports four echocardiographic findings that suggest the presence of ATAAD. For each finding, we describe the associated pathophysiology and summarize the literature evaluating diagnostic utility. We also use high-quality media to provide step-by-step tutorials and advanced pearls and pitfalls for translation to the bedside. The echocardiographic findings that suggest ATAAD are: aortic intimal flap, aortic root enlargement, aortic regurgitation, and pericardial effusion. The use of cardiac POCUS can rule in or strongly suggest the diagnosis of ATAAD. Although cardiac POCUS on its own should not be used to rule out ATAAD, the lack of any suggestive echocardiographic findings may lower suspicion for this diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Cardiac tamponade is a rare but serious complication of myocardial infarction, most often occurring in cases of complete myocardial rupture. Atypical forms, such as oozing-type rupture, without macroscopic rupture, can also cause a tamponade. We report an exceptional case of hemorrhagic tamponade due to subacute myocardial infarction without obvious myocardial rupture, occurring in a patient with no known medical history. We report a case of a 70-year-old man who was found in shock on a public street after several weeks of atypical chest pain. On admission, he presented with cardiogenic shock and signs of peripheral hypoperfusion, severe hypotension, and tachycardia. Emergency echocardiography revealed a large circumferential pericardial effusion associated with global left ventricular hypokinesia. Biomarkers showed severe myocardial injury. CT angiography, performed before drainage to exclude aortic dissection requiring emergency surgery, confirmed the hemorrhagic effusion without dissection. While pericardial drainage was planned, the patient experienced refractory cardiac arrest. Salvage thoracotomy revealed a hemorrhagic effusion without macroscopic myocardial rupture. Post-infarction hemorrhagic tamponade may result from complete myocardial rupture (blowout) or from an \"oozing\" form, related to micro-tears or epicardial vascular fragility. In the present case, the rapid progression to terminal shock contrasts with previously reported cases in the literature, which were generally more subacute. Echocardiography provided an immediate diagnostic orientation, demonstrating its crucial role in managing shock. This case illustrates a rare but lethal complication of subacute myocardial infarction, i.e., hemorrhagic tamponade without complete myocardial rupture. It shows the importance of early tamponade diagnosis, the important contribution of emergency echocardiography, and the severity of silent-evolving infarctions in the context of unrecognized atherosclerotic disease."

Such pain may mimic common musculoskeletal or visceral disorders such as vertebrogenic, renal, or gastrointestinal pain, leading to diagnostic delays and adverse outcomes. This case series underscores how atypical vertebrogenic-like pain can conceal underlying aortic pathology and highlights the importance of early imaging in suspicious cases. A 56-year-old man with descending thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm, and 35-year-old man with Stanford Type A ascending aortic dissection. CT angiography of the aorta due to persistent vertebrogenic back pain despite treatment of lumbar spine pathology revealing a large descending thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. In second case a CT scan of the cervical and thoracic spine performed after persistent pain despite cervical vertebrogenic syndrome analgesics treatment led to aortic dissection confirmation. Elective surgical repair of aneurysm via thoraco-phreno-laparotomy. The aneurysm was resected and replaced with a 22-mm aorto-aortic Dacron graft. In second case, an emergency surgery with veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support with an open chest due to ongoing uncontrollable hemorrhage was provided. Patient was discharged on postoperative day 7 in stable condition. A second patient passed away of early complications as systemic inflammatory response syndrome, acute renal failure, and circulatory shock. These cases emphasize the diagnostic challenges of aortic pathologies in the context of misleading clinical features. Physicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for acute aortic syndromes, particularly when encountering atypical or refractory pain in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Early diagnosis and adherence to guideline-based management are critical to improving survival in these high-risk emergencies."

Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model accounting for the influence of heterogeneity. Subgroup, sensitivity, and meta-regression analyses explored heterogeneity. The study quality was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Twenty-one retrospective cohort studies involving 19,291 patients were included. DM was associated with a modestly increased short-term mortality risk (OR = 1.48; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.91; p = 0.003; I2 = 44%). The results were consistent in sensitivity analyses restricted to surgical patients (OR = 1.52; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.96; p = 0.001). Subgroup analyses showed no significant differences by region, follow-up duration, analytic model, or NOS score (all p for subgroup differences > 0.05). Meta-regression analysis showed that sample size was negatively correlated with the association (coefficient = - 0.000074, p = 0.02), which fully explained the source of heterogeneity (adjusted R2 = 100%). This meta-analysis of retrospective studies suggests that DM may be associated with higher short-term mortality in ATAAD. Given the observational nature of the evidence, further prospective studies are needed to clarify this relationship."

    "abstract": "Stanford type A aortic dissection is a life-threatening cardiovascular emergency requiring urgent surgical intervention. Despite advances in treatment, post-operative recovery remains challenging with complex health management needs. Current care models often lack patient-centered insights into their evolving experiences across diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation phases. Therefore, exploring the disease management journey of patients from the perspective of patient experience is of great significance to improve the prognosis of patients. This study aims to delineate patients' health management journey to identify critical care transitions and unmet support needs, ultimately informing targeted nursing interventions. Based on the patient journey map framework and using a descriptive qualitative research method, 23 patients with Stanford type A aortic dissection were selected for semi-structured interviews from January 2023 to March 2024. Conventional inductive content analysis was used to analyze the interview data. The patient journey maps were drawn by using Word Processing System software. Three distinct phases of care were identified: diagnostic phase, in-hospital treatment phase, and long-term self-management phase. From the dimensions of tasks, emotions, and pain points, the study highlighted prominent health management issues and twenty-seven themes, including marked symptom distress during the entire disease journey, distinct psychological experiences characterize different phases of the disease journey, and evolving health service requirements throughout the disease trajectory. The patient journey maps were ultimately developed based on sub-themes. The disease journey of patients with Stanford type A aortic dissection is lengthy, and their health management issues are complex, dynamic, and multidimensional. Our findings directly inform the development of targeted nursing interventions, such as structured pre-operative guidance to address acute symptoms and fears, nurse-led ICU interventions to reduce psychological problems, and a dedicated transition coordinator role to bridge the critical gap from hospital to home. Implementing such a phase-specific, patient-centered approach is essential to improving long-term outcomes. Future research could focus on developing nursing intervention strategies for key events under a time-matched model, targeting the health problems and care needs at different stages, to assist in comprehensive health care management.

    "abstract": "In cases of acute type A aortic dissection, including iatrogenic cases following transcatheter procedures, the choice of arterial cannulation site has a critical influence on early haemodynamics, organ protection and the risk of malperfusion. Transapical left ventricular cannulation has been suggested as a 'central' approach for rapidly establishing cardiopulmonary bypass with antegrade true-lumen flow. This review summarises the current evidence on TAC in acute type A dissection, focusing on indications, technical aspects and clinical outcomes. We conducted a narrative review of observational studies and technical reports describing TAC for the surgical repair of acute type A aortic dissection. Particular attention was paid to patient selection, operative technique, perioperative complications, and early and mid-term results. Across the published series, TAC is primarily employed in haemodynamically unstable patients or when the peripheral arteries are dissected, diseased, or unsuitable. A long arterial cannula is introduced through the left ventricular apex, crosses the aortic valve and is positioned in the true lumen of the ascending aorta under echocardiographic guidance. This configuration enables the rapid initiation of CPB, shortens skin-to-pump times, and provides reliable antegrade inflow. Early mortality and stroke rates are comparable to those associated with other cannulation strategies. Reported complications include malperfusion requiring site conversion, apical bleeding and rare local structural damage. These can be minimised through standardised technique and systematic imaging. TAC is a valuable bail-out option and, in selected patients, a primary cannulation option for acute type A aortic dissection when conventional arterial access is unsafe or ineffective. Although it offers fast and reproducible establishment of antegrade true-lumen flow, it requires specific expertise in apical exposure and intraoperative echocardiography. It should therefore be integrated into a structured perfusion and repair strategy."

Beyond reports analyzing the incidence of ATAAD in large registries, there is only scarce data illuminating this complication. Our aim was to analyze its incidence, possible mechanisms, and management in a large two-center cohort. We performed a retrospective analysis for ATAAD following TAVI in our two-center registry to assess the incidence and outcome, as well as to analyze different causal mechanisms and treatment strategies. 10,238 patients received TAVI between 2008 and 2023. Incidence of ATAAD was 0.15 % (n = 15), of which most occurred periprocedurally. In-hospital mortality was 47 %. Patients with ATAAD were treated with a variety of approaches, 67 % surgically, 27 % interventionally and one patient was treated conservatively solely by blood pressure control. Our results showed no significant associations of ATAAD to the type of prosthetic valves used. Most frequent suspected mechanisms included radial annular stress from balloon or valve expansion (47 %) and catheter- or wire-induced trauma (20 %). Among anatomical risk factors, dilation of the ascending aorta, a horizontal aorta, a small annulus and heavy calcification were frequent contributors. ATAAD after TAVI, though rare, is a severe complication with a high mortality. Growing procedure volumes and complex anatomies will increase its incidence. Surgeons and interventionalists awareness, pre-procedural planning, institutional readiness, and tailored management pathways are essential to mitigate risk and improve outcomes."

Discriminative ability was assessed via the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and calibration was evaluated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, observed-to-expected ratios, model deviance, and Cox-Snell R². The overall operative mortality rate was 4.6% (38/829). In the total cohort, SORT V2 showed good discrimination (AUC = 0.82) and more reliable calibration than SORT V1 and EuroSCORE II. In dissection, the German Registry for Acute Type Aortic Dissection achieved the highest discrimination (AUC = 0.79), and the Penn classification showed the most favorable calibration; SORT V2 maintained acceptable calibration, comparing favorably with EuroSCORE II. Performance was preserved in prespecified subgroups and bootstrap internal validation supported the stability of estimates. In thoracic aortic surgery, SORT V2 provides a pragmatic option for preoperative risk estimation, with good discrimination and reliable calibration across the full cohort and key subgroups. Its inclusion of a preoperative clinical context rating may facilitate capturing case complexity. Multicenter studies are warranted to confirm generalizability and refine prediction in specific procedural settings."

    "abstract": "Boerhaave syndrome is a rare but potentially fatal condition characterized by spontaneous transmural rupture of the esophagus, most often triggered by a sudden rise in intraluminal pressure against a closed glottis following forceful retching. Its clinical presentation can mimic other life‑threatening thoracic emergencies such as myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, or aortic dissection. A 50-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department with sudden onset of severe central chest pain radiating to the left side associated with shortness of breath, following multiple episodes of forceful vomiting. On examination, he was hemodynamically stable. Chest and soft-tissue neck radiographs demonstrated surgical emphysema, and a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest confirmed esophageal rupture with extraluminal air and food residue. The patient was managed with intravenous fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and urgent cardiothoracic referral for definitive management. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for Boerhaave syndrome in patients presenting with chest pain following episodes of forceful vomiting, as early recognition and prompt intervention are vital to reduce morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an established treatment for severe aortic stenosis. Despite its minimally invasive nature, serious complications can occur, particularly in frail, elderly individuals. An 89-year-old, frail woman with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and multiple comorbidities underwent elective TAVI. The procedure, planned under conscious sedation, was complicated by an anaphylactic reaction to an antibiotic, requiring emergency intubation, vasopressor support, and intensive care admission. TAVI was subsequently completed successfully. Postoperatively, she developed sudden chest and back pain, new-onset atrial fibrillation with hemodynamic instability, and a reduced level of consciousness. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a thoracic aortic dissection (AD). Given her advanced age, frailty, and poor surgical candidacy, no further intervention was pursued. Despite maximal supportive therapy, she deteriorated and passed away peacefully. This case highlights the challenges of managing frail, elderly patients undergoing TAVI. Although the procedure offers a less invasive alternative to surgery, severe complications such as AD may occur. Individualized risk assessment, multidisciplinary evaluation, and alignment of treatment goals are essential for optimal care."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) still remains a life-threatening medical emergency. However, only a few data exist on sex-related differences in patients with AAD over the recent years. The medical records of 192 consecutive patients admitted to Juntendo University Urayasu Hospital from January 2008 to December 2021 who had been diagnosed with AAD were retrospectively collected. Thereafter, sex-related differences in patient characteristics, type of dissection, maximal diameters of dissection, the onset-to-arrival time, and short-term mortality were determined. A total of 164 patients were ultimately enrolled in this study. Compared to men, women were significantly older, were less obese, and had lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome. A significantly higher proportion of women than men underwent Stanford type A dissections (52% vs. 25%), except among those aged 50 years and younger. Women had significantly larger maximal aortic dissection diameters compared to men (43.3 ± 9.5 vs. 38.9 ± 7.2 mm). Women with type A dissection were older, had lower body mass index and albumin levels compared to men, and demonstrated poorer renal function than women with type B dissection. In the context of Japan's aging society, older, underweight women with chronic kidney disease and malnutrition may represent a high-risk population for Stanford type A aortic dissection."

We performed PR technique, reconstructing only the right coronary sinus with a prosthetic patch while preserving the native aortic valve. The patient recovered well and postoperative computed tomography (CT) showed patent reconstructed right coronary artery. PR technique, when appropriately indicated, offers advantages of shorter operative time with native valve preservation, making it a valuable option for selected cases of acute aortic dissection involving the aortic root."

We present a case of an 84-year-old woman in which the initial manifestations were transient bilateral lower-limb weakness accompanied by bradycardia and hypotension. Electrocardiography demonstrated marked sinus bradycardia without ischemic changes, and laboratory tests were unremarkable except for an elevated D-dimer. Bedside carotid duplex ultrasonography incidentally identified an intimal flap in the common carotid artery, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) confirmed Stanford type A aortic dissection involving the aortic arch with extension into both common carotid arteries. The patient underwent emergent valve-sparing supracoronary ascending aortic replacement. This case underscores the importance of recognizing unexplained bradycardia, hypotension, and transient muscle weakness as early clues to painless aortic dissection. Carotid duplex ultrasonography may aid diagnosis in such atypical presentations and should be considered when standard evaluations are inconclusive, potentially reducing missed or delayed diagnoses."

This study developed 11 machine learning regression models to predict operative duration and identify key clinical factors influencing surgical time in TAAD. In this single-center retrospective cohort study of 505 patients who underwent surgery from December 2017 to March 2023. Specifically, 11 machine learning models were construct using 47 preoperative and intraoperative features to predict operative duration. Model performance was assessed by R2, RMSE, and MAE, and SHAP analysis enhanced interpretability. The study primarily consisted of middle-aged patients, comprising 73.4% males and 26.6% females. Furthermore, most patients underwent complex aortic procedures under time-constrained preoperative conditions. Procedures involving root replacement and total arch replacement were associated with longer surgical durations. The ExtraTrees Regressor had the highest predictive accuracy. SHAP analysis revealed five key features: Duration of extracorporeal circulation, Duration of aortic occlusion, Intraoperative blood transfusion, Treatment method for the aortic arch, and Treatment method for the aortic root. This study developed high-performance predictive models to identify key features affecting operative duration in TAAD surgery. Complex reconstructions prolong procedures, and longer aortic occlusion further contributes to this effect. The findings highlight the major influence of surgical strategies and intraoperative management on surgical duration. Special consideration remains warranted for specific patient subgroups."

    "abstract": "Acute Type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is characterized by acute onset and rapid progression, with aortic rupture due to dissection extension being the primary lethal mechanism. Timely identification of high-risk patients is critical for prioritizing surgical intervention to reduce rupture incidence. This study aimed to develop and validate an interpretable machine learning model to predict aortic rupture in ATAAD patients, thereby improving risk classification and supporting clinical decisions. Medical records of ATAAD patients from Xiamen Cardiovascular Hospital (January 2019-October 2024) were retrospectively analyzed. Predictors were screened via statistical significance (p <  0.05) using seven machine learning algorithms, with the Salp Swarm Optimization Algorithm (SSA) optimizing hyperparameters for Random Forest and XGBoost models. To address class imbalance (47 rupture cases, 6.1%), SMOTE was implemented for data augmentation. Model performance was evaluated by accuracy, F1-score, precision, ROC-AUC, sensitivity, and specificity, supplemented by interpretability analyses through feature importance ranking and SHAP. Among 774 included ATAAD patients, the SSA-optimized Random Forest model achieved optimal performance (test dataset: 97.41% accuracy, 0.980 ROC-AUC, 81.82% F1-score). Key predictors included estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), hypotension at admission, and white blood cell count. This work provides a quantitative tool for emergency care prioritization, with SSA enhancing model precision for high-risk patient identification, though multicenter studies are needed to validate generalizability."

This study aimed to investigate the predictive value of the preoperative CRP-albumin-lymphocyte (CALLY) index for POIM in ATAAD patients and to construct a corresponding nomogram model. This retrospective study enrolled 522 surgically treated ATAAD patients admitted to Fujian Medical University Union Hospital between October 2015 and July 2024, with POIM designated as the study endpoint. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of POIM,and LASSO regression was subsequently used to develop a predictive model. This study included a total of 522 patients. The results demonstrated that the preoperative CALLY index was an independent protective factor for POIM (OR=0.131, 95% CI:0.110-0.199), and its predictive performance (AUC=0.820) was superior to that of individual parameters such as lymphocyte count, albumin, and CRP. Patients with lower CALLY index had significantly higher incidences of postoperative gastrointestinal hemorrhage, acute kidney injury, and POIM (P<0.05). The nomogram model integrating pre-hospital emergency care, prothrombin time, urea, creatine kinase, troponin I, lactate, and CALLY index showed good predictive performance (AUC=0.843). Internal and external validations yielded robust AUCs of 0.849 and 0.869, respectively, with Hosmer-Lemeshow tests confirming good fit (P>0.05).Subgroup analysis revealed that the predictive value of the CALLY index was consistent across different clinical subgroups. The preoperative CALLY index demonstrates significant predictive efficacy for POIM in ATAAD patients. The developed nomogram model, incorporating the CALLY index, provides a practical tool for optimizing perioperative decision-making."

Building on the strong correlation between TAD and SIRT3 observed in our preliminary studies, we aim to leverage pharmacological interventions to enhance the clinical translation of this mechanism. Based on the SIRT3 activator honokiol, we synthesized a highly efficient, pH-responsive and biodegradable poly-honokiol prodrug synthesized via a metal-free phenol-yne click polymerization strategy, achieving an unprecedented drug-loading content of 83.65%, and subsequently investigated its pharmacological activity and underlying mechanisms using a β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN)-induced TAD model. Compared with honokiol, poly-honokiol markedly improved survival and reduced TAD incidence in mice by preventing vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) loss. Mechanistic investigations reveal that poly-honokiol activates the mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3, which induce the deacetylation of both the antioxidant enzyme SOD2 and the key ferroptosis regulator COX2, thereby reducing ferrous ion (Fe2+) accumulation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels while suppressing mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, ultimately attenuating ferroptosis-induced VSMC loss. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that poly-honokiol is a potent preventive candidate for TAD, offering both high drug-loading efficiency and targeted mitochondrial protection."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (TA-AAD) is a life-threatening cardiovascular emergency, with 1% hourly mortality in untreated patients and urgent surgical intervention required upon diagnosis. However, its clinical manifestations overlap significantly with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), leading to persistently high misdiagnosis rates in practice. Existing clinical guidelines lack targeted differential protocols for coexistent TA-AAD and AMI, often resulting in misclassification (e.g., TA-AAD as AMI) and subsequent inappropriate treatment that raises mortality. Thus, case analysis is urgently needed to identify diagnostic dilemmas and optimize clinical pathways. This report analyzes a patient with Stanford TA-AAD who initially presented with acute anterior myocardial infarction (a high-risk case requiring mechanical circulatory support). The patient was admitted for persistent chest pain. The patient had electrocardiogram findings of coved ST-segment elevation and significantly elevated myocardial enzymes, meeting ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction criteria. After percutaneous coronary intervention, refractory low cardiac output persisted, prompting extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Ascending aortic dissection was accidentally detected by bedside ultrasound, confirming TA-AAD. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and subsequent major vascular surgery. Despite surgical intervention, the patient ultimately died. This case underscores the need for clinicians to be alert to the coexistence of TA-AAD and AMI in chest pain patients: percutaneous coronary intervention may exacerbate dissection progression and surgical hemostatic difficulty, while misdiagnosis combined with inappropriate treatment markedly increases mortality. Analyzing this fatal misdiagnosis provides practical references for optimizing diagnostic/therapeutic workflows, promoting multidisciplinary team involvement in decision-making, and reducing misdiagnosis-related adverse outcomes - ultimately offering valuable clinical guidance for improving patient survival."

Despite clinical symptoms mimicking subarachnoid hemorrhage and transitory cerebral ischemia, CT-angiography of the cerebrum and thorax revealed a Stanford type A aortic dissection. Consequently, the patient underwent insertion of a prosthesis at the aortic root and arch. In this case report, we suggest a high level of suspicion for aortic dissection in patients presenting with a sudden severe headache and/or neurological deficits accompanied by chest/back/abdominal pain, nausea, and loss of consciousness. At the same time, asymmetry of pulse and blood pressure asymmetry of the arms should also raise suspicion. An acute CT angiography with the aim of timely diagnosis will allow earlier treatment for this life-threatening condition."

While initial blood tests showed mild leukocytosis and raised lactate, a CT aorta excluded dissection but revealed multiple hepatic metastases with a large subcapsular hematoma and pulmonary nodules. A follow-up CT mesenteric angiogram demonstrated interval hematoma expansion without active bleeding, further metastatic progression, and a segmental pulmonary embolus. Owing to frailty and advanced malignancy, a multidisciplinary team recommended conservative management. This case highlights the diagnostic conundrum of hepatic hemorrhage in melanoma, which may mimic other acute pathologies such as aortic dissection or acute coronary syndrome. Prompt cross-sectional imaging, serial monitoring, and early multidisciplinary input are essential for accurate diagnosis and for balancing intervention risk against quality of life in complex oncology presentations."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a life-threatening cardiovascular surgical emergency with a mortality of 20-25%. This review offers an overview of current research on the morphology, taxonomy, epidemiology, and anesthetic, perfusion, and surgical strategies involved in ATAAD. Moreover, this review examines methods for predicting mortality risk and explores clinician-patient interactions, particularly those involving patients who refuse blood transfusions. The literature search included PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect databases, as well as any relevant books. This review references 144 sources: 129 peer-reviewed articles and 15 book chapters or books. Modern classification systems utilize aortic zones based on the location of intimal tears and the extent of dissection; recent updates have included coronary artery dissection as an additional mapping criterion. Socioeconomic factors are linked to higher ATAAD incidence and poorer long-term survival post-surgery. The duration of global myocardial ischemia correlates with mortality and is a key element in the surgical strategy. Compared to deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA), moderate HCA with cerebral perfusion provides benefits such as reduced bleeding and improved survival. Standard prediction models may not accurately assess risks in patients with life-threatening anemia who refuse blood transfusion. Therefore, incorporating Auckland and Hamilton anemia mortality risk scores alongside conventional tools can improve prognostic accuracy and support personalized management. An interpretive-deliberative model balances patient preferences with surgical outcomes, especially in bloodless surgery. Advances in surgical and endovascular management, as well as postoperative strategies for residual aortic disease, have also been explored. Significant progress has been made in assessing in-hospital mortality, improving doctor-patient communication, refining anesthetic and perfusion techniques, and enhancing surgical management of ATAAD. However, further research is needed to validate these approaches."

A 68-year-old man, a smoker with hypertension, presented with chest pain. Electrocardiogram showed Q waves with mild ST-segment elevation. Myoglobin and D-dimer were mildly elevated. Coronary angiography revealed near-total occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery with aneurysmal dilation and severe stenosis of the distal right coronary artery. Emergency percutaneous coronary intervention relieved symptoms, but severe chest-back pain with shock recurred 8 hours later. Computed tomography angiography confirmed Stanford type A dissection with rupture and massive pericardial effusion. Despite surgery and intensive care, the patient died of multiorgan failure. In atypical acute myocardial infarction, a rapid loop combining D-dimer, bedside echocardiography, computed tomography angiography, and AAD risk scoring may reduce missed diagnoses.

    "abstract": "Syncope places a significant burden on emergency departments (EDs), often prompting extensive testing to exclude life-threatening conditions. However, the diagnostic utility of troponin, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), and outpatient cardiac monitoring remains unclear. This systematic review assessed the diagnostic accuracy of these tests in adults presenting with syncope. The research question was: In ED patients with syncope, does TTE, cardiac biomarkers (troponin, BNP), or outpatient arrhythmia monitoring, compared with no testing, improve outcomes within 30 days? Primary outcomes included adverse events (death, arrhythmias, structural/ischemic heart disease, and select non-cardiac causes such as pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection) for biomarkers and diagnostic yield for TTE and monitoring. Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-) were calculated for biomarkers, while diagnostic yield with 95% CI was reported for TTE and monitoring. Risk of bias was assessed using JBI and QUADAS-2. The database searches identified 1759 citations. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 41 studies (21,557 patients) were included. Significant heterogeneity among the included trials (all with I2 > 90%) precluded meta-analysis. For BNP, LR+ ranged 1.4-47 and LR- 0.06-0.4; for troponin, LR+ 1.9-11.2 and LR- 0.2-0.9. TTE diagnostic yield was 0%-29% overall and 8%-28% in high-risk groups. Outpatient monitoring yielded 1%-59% overall and 12%-42% in high-risk patients. In ED patients with syncope, the diagnostic accuracy and yield of cardiac biomarkers, TTE, and outpatient monitoring show substantial variability, largely due to differences in patient populations, outcome measures, and study methodologies. Based on the existing evidence, these modalities in isolation cannot be recommended for routine use in syncope evaluation. Among these tests, the diagnostic yield of TTE and outpatient monitoring is greater in patients with cardiac risk factors and could potentially contribute to a more accurate diagnosis."

All patients consecutively treated for an emergent aortic arch pathology were included in this retrospective single-center cohort study between July 2014 and March 2023. In each case, the distal smaller fenestration for the left subclavian artery (LSA) was the only 1 stented. For a double-fenestrated endograft, a proximal larger fenestration that incorporated both the brachiocephalic trunk and the left common carotid artery was added. A total of 86 patients with complicated aortic arch lesions were treated, with 74% being men and a mean age of 68 years. Of these, 63% underwent single LSA fenestration, while 37% had double-fenestrated thoracic endovascular aortic repair. The main indications for repair included acute complicated type B aortic dissection (TBAD) (54%), traumatic transection of the aorta (TTA) (19%), and other conditions such as penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU), degenerative aneurysm (DA), pseudoaneurysm (PSA), and aortic thrombus. The technical success rate was 91%, with modification times of 10 minutes for single fenestration and 23 minutes for double fenestration. Thirty-day mortality was 19%, with no significant difference between the 2 fenestration types. Neurologic events occurred in 3 patients (3%), and 3 (3%) patients had perioperative retrograde dissection. Endoleaks occurred in 5% (type 1) and 2% (type 3), with no type 2 endoleaks. Eight patients (9%) required reintervention, and all supra-aortic trunks remained patent. During a follow-up of 27.6 months, no patients experienced aortic rupture (AR), neurological events, or required conversion to open surgery. Single and double PMEGs are suitable and reproducible treatment for emergent serious aortic arch lesions, with comparable outcomes whatever the aortic landing zone and number of fenestrations.Clinical ImpactFenestrated physician-modified endovascular grafts for emergent aortic arch repair appear to be a promising treatment, offering reproducibility, rapid deployment, and limited manipulation of supra-aortic trunks. The standardized technique eliminates the need for complex sizing and benefits from consistent aortic arch anatomy in most patients. It provides clinicians with a practical and efficient option in emergency settings, achieving high technical success with acceptable complication rates."

In contemporary repair, there is a relatively high risk. We aimed to identify predictors of major complications after open extent III TAAA repair and explore differences between men and women. In this retrospective study, 732 patients (median age, 69 years; quartile 1-quartile 3, 61-74 years) who underwent extent III repair between 1990 and 2021 were stratified by sex (306 women [41.8%] and 426 men [58.2%]). Statistical models identified independent predictors of operative mortality and adverse events (comprising operative death or persistent stroke, paraplegia, paraparesis, or renal failure). Inverse probability of treatment weighting analysis was done to eliminate baseline differences between groups when the primary outcomes were assessed. Competing risk analyses compared relative rates of survival and freedom from repair failure between men and women. Operative mortality was 8.7% (women 10.8% vs men 7.3%; P = .1), and adverse events occurred in 16.8% of patients (women 20.6% vs men 14.1%; P = .02). Predictors of operative mortality were female sex, a larger maximal aortic diameter, chronic kidney disease, chronic symptoms, longer cross-clamp time, and more packed red blood cell units transfused. Independent predictors of adverse events were female sex, chronic kidney disease, longer cross-clamp time, branch vessel stenting, and more packed red blood cell units transfused. Elective operation predicted better operative survival and fewer adverse events than urgent or emergency repairs. Weighted analysis (inverse probability of treatment weighting adjustment) showed that female sex was independently predictive of adverse events (odds ratio, 1.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-2.80; P = .02). Women and men did not differ significantly in late survival (P = .3) or freedom from repair failure (P > .9). Open extent III repair remains a durable approach for TAAA repair but carries a notable risk of operative mortality and adverse events. Female sex independently predicts adverse events after weighting; however, long-term survival is comparable between men and women. These insights into the extent III repair patient population could be used to revise treatment guidelines and, thus, to improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic dissection (TAD), a life-threatening vascular emergency requiring urgent pharmacological intervention, prompted investigation into arachidonic acid metabolites based on their established roles in inflammation and vascular homeostasis. Through comprehensive plasma metabolomics analysis performed in both TAD patients and a β-aminopropionitrile monofumarate (BAPN)-induced mouse model, significant elevation of 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) was identified, accompanied by marked upregulation of its synthetic enzyme 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX) in dissected aortic tissues. The pathogenetic significance was further demonstrated by the substantial protection against TAD progression that was observed in Alox15-deficient mice. Mechanistically, 12-HETE was confirmed to function as an endogenous ligand for the BLT2 receptor on macrophages, leading to activation of the NOX-1/ROS/NF-κB signaling cascade. This signaling activation was shown to induce inflammatory cytokine release and promote inflammatory cell recruitment, ultimately resulting in pathological phenotype switching of vascular smooth muscle cells. The therapeutic potential was validated by significant reduction in dissection rupture rates that was achieved with either the 12/15-LOX inhibitor ML351 or the BLT2 antagonist LY255283, with maximal efficacy being demonstrated when both agents were administered in combination. These findings establish the 12-HETE-BLT2 axis as a key driver of TAD pathogenesis and validate its potential as a promising therapeutic target for clinical intervention."

    "abstract": "To determine whether intraoperative arterial hypotension during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is associated with postoperative lung injury (PLI) in patients undergoing emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD). Single-center retrospective cohort study with propensity score matching and sensitivity analyses. A tertiary academic cardiovascular intensive care unit in France. A total of 150 adult patients who underwent emergency ATAAD repair between January 2018 and December 2020. Patients with refractory low cardiac output syndrome or requiring extracorporeal life support were excluded. No therapeutic intervention was applied. Intraoperative arterial pressure was continuously recorded during CPB to evaluate exposure to hypotension. PLI was defined as a PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio ≤200 mmHg for more than 24 consecutive hours within the first 10 postoperative days. The primary exposure was mean arterial pressure <50 mmHg sustained for more than 10 minutes during CPB. After propensity score matching (n = 144), PLI occurred in 54.2% of hypotensive patients versus 27.8% in nonhypotensive patients (odds ratio 3.07, 95% confidence interval [1.54-6.15], p < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated a dose-response association with deeper and longer hypotension, including a significant association for mean arterial pressure <55 mmHg lasting >10 minutes (odds ratio 2.35, 95% confidence interval [1.11-4.99], p = 0.03). This analysis examining pulmonary outcomes was performed on one of the largest single-center ATAAD surgical cohorts to date. The current findings suggest that both the depth and duration of intraoperative hypotension during CPB are associated with PLI. This highlights intraoperative blood pressure as a potentially modifiable factor, but confirmation in prospective interventional studies is required."

    "title": "A Novel Presentation of Stanford Type A Aortic Dissection with Vaginal Bleeding: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "This case is unique in that it documents isolated, painless vaginal bleeding as the sole presenting symptom of a Stanford type A aortic dissection (STAAD), a presentation not previously reported. It adds to the literature by expanding the spectrum of atypical aortic dissection presentations and underscores the need to consider this diagnosis in elderly patients with vascular risk factors, even when they present with non-classical symptoms such as unexplained bleeding. We present a novel case of STAAD in a 72-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, dyslipidaemia, prior hysterectomy, and cholecystectomy. Her primary complaint was a single, transient episode of painless vaginal bleeding. Notable clinical findings included a diminished right radial pulse, a significant inter-arm blood pressure discrepancy, and unremarkable systemic and vaginal examinations. Given these findings, further evaluation was pursued. Computed tomography aortography revealed a STAAD extending from the aortic arch to the bifurcation, involving the left internal iliac artery and a vaginal arterial branch. The patient underwent emergent surgical repair and was discharged in good condition on hospital day 11. At her most recent follow-up, three years post-event, she remained clinically stable with no recurrence. Isolated painless vaginal bleeding, although uncommon, may indicate life-threatening pathology. Subtle signs, such as inter-arm blood pressure discrepancy, can offer critical diagnostic clues, underscoring the importance of comprehensive evaluation in atypical emergency presentations."

    "abstract": "Patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to acute aortic dissection (AAD) may receive inappropriate intravenous thrombolysis (IVT). Management in this situation, particularly regarding the timing of aortic surgery, remains unclear. We present a case of delayed aortic surgery after IVT for AIS due to AAD, which highlights the unusual consequences of IVT in AAD. An 87-year-old woman with left upper limb paralysis presented to a local hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified a cerebral infarction in the right frontal lobe. Despite intravenous administration of alteplase 0.6 mg/kg (nationally approved dose in Japan), the paralysis remained unchanged. Subsequent MRI revealed extensive infarction in the right watershed area and another left cerebellar hemisphere infarction. Upon transfer to our hospital, computed tomography (CT) aortogram confirmed AAD with an entry and false lumen thrombus in the ascending aorta. Although emergency aortic surgery was indicated, we delayed surgery because of the risks of excessive bleeding and thrombolysis-related intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Brain CT 24 h after IVT did not reveal ICH. However, new infarctions were detected, suggesting embolism from fragments of a false lumen thrombus. The fibrinogen level below the measurable limit at that time recovered 38 h after IVT, guiding the surgery timing. Aortic surgery was completed without hemostasis difficulty. The patient recovered uneventfully with neurological improvement. This case illustrates the complex challenges in managing AAD following inappropriate IVT, highlighting the importance of monitoring fibrinogen levels and paying attention to new cerebral infarction in similar cases. For patients who have received IVT and develop hypofibrinogenemia, delaying surgery until the recovery of fibrinogen levels may be viable in selected cases. However, this approach must be weighed against the risks of untreated AAD during the waiting period."

    "abstract": "Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) and aortic dissection are rare but severe complications of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), with no standardized surgical approach. A 74-year-old woman developed PVE 6 months after TAVR with an Evolut PRO+ valve (Medtronic). Echocardiography revealed valve vegetation and perivalvular leakage, and computed tomography showed localized ascending aortic dissection. Emergency surgery involved careful removal of the Evolut PRO+ using sutureless aortic valve replacement and ascending aorta replacement. Successful management of TAVR-related PVE with aortic dissection in high-risk patients requires a clear understanding of prosthetic valve characteristics and tailored surgical planning. Techniques such as cold-water explantation and sutureless aortic valve replacement can be particularly useful in minimizing operative risk. This case highlights a reproducible strategy for complex TAVR complications. Cold-water explantation and the snare technique allows safe valve removal, while sutureless aortic valve replacement shortens procedural time, offering practical advantages in high-risk patients."

    "abstract": "Malperfusion syndrome (MPS) and acute compartment syndrome (ACS) complicating acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) are lethal conditions. Despite the restoration of true lumen flow following successful surgical or endovascular interventions, patients may succumb to metabolic abnormalities and end-organ failure. This case presents a series of therapies for ATAAD accompanied by severe MPS and ACS of the lower extremity. Immediate open repair surgery was performed to prevent aortic rupture and reopen the visceral artery, and endovascular treatment ensured limb reperfusion. Fasciotomy was performed for ACS with compartment decompression, and continuous blood purification facilitated the restoration of organ function. Proximal aortic repair is unlikely to completely restore perfusion to aortic branch vessels in cases of ischemia caused by dissection-related obstruction. A multimodal management strategy, encompassing medical therapy, urgent open repair, endovascular stenting, fasciotomy, continuous blood purification, and a multimodal team, may effectively salvage the patient. ATAAD is an emergent and potentially fatal disease, particularly complicated by MPS. A multimodal management strategy may yield satisfactory clinical outcomes."

We report the case of a 50-year-old construction worker who sustained an impalement injury after falling approximately 8m onto an upright standing wooden hammer handle, resulting in thoracoabdominal penetration. The injury resulted in multiple trauma, including damage to the lungs, diaphragm, spleen and kidneys as well as a contained dissection of the thoracic aorta. The patient was treated within the framework of an interdisciplinary, time-critical management approach involving emergency surgical interventions and thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). Despite initial hemorrhagic shock and respiratory complications, the patient was successfully stabilized and transferred to inpatient rehabilitation after 6 weeks. This case highlights the importance of structured emergency response systems, advanced endovascular techniques and early psychological trauma care to improve long-term outcomes and prevent posttraumatic stress disorders. Thorakoabdominelle Pfählungsverletzungen mit Beteiligung der Aorta stellen eine extrem seltene, jedoch hochgradig lebensbedrohliche Traumakonstellation dar. Der vorliegende Fall beschreibt einen 50-jährigen Bauarbeiter, der nach einem Sturz aus etwa 8 m Höhe von einem senkrecht stehenden Holzstiel thorakoabdominell durchbohrt wurde. Dabei kam es zu multiplen Verletzungen von Lunge, Zwerchfell, Milz, Niere sowie zu einer gedeckten Dissektion der thorakalen Aorta. Die Versorgung erfolgte im Rahmen eines interdisziplinären zeitkritischen Managements mit notfallchirurgischen Interventionen und endovaskulärer Aortenreparatur („thoracic endovascular aortic repair“ [TEVAR]). Trotz initialen hämorrhagischen Schocks und beatmungsassoziierten Komplikationen konnte der Patient stabilisiert und nach 6 Wochen in die stationäre Rehabilitation überführt werden.

We aimed to examine the prognostic factors and long-term outcomes of surgically treated patients with aTAAD. We analyzed data from 952 surgically treated aTAAD patients. The association between the perioperative factors and long-term mortality of these patients was examined. Altogether, 93 patients died during the follow-up period, resulting in a 5-year mortality rate of 9.7%. The patients who died were older (P=0.02), had averagely higher European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) II scores (P=0.042), longer cardiopulmonary bypass time (CPBT) (P=0.003), and tended to have postoperative kidney dysfunction (P=0.002) and postoperative cerebral accident (P=0.01). Univariate analysis revealed that age, intensive care unit stay, ventilation use, CPBT, albumin (both at admission and post-surgery), and creatinine (post-surgery) were also significantly associated with long-term mortality. After adjusting for the EuroSCORE II score in the multivariate analysis, only low albumin (both at admission and post-surgery) and high creatinine (post-surgery) levels remained as independent predictors of long-term mortality. The EuroSCORE II score could be useful in predicting the long-term mortality of surgically treated aTAAD patients. Low albumin (both at admission and post-surgery) and high creatinine (post-surgery) levels are also important predictors."

A 57-year-old man underwent emergency partial aortic arch replacement for acute type A aortic dissection. The proximal stump was reinforced using internal and external polytetrafluoroethylene felt strips. The patient subsequently developed profound mechanical hemolytic anemia two weeks after the operation. Computed tomography did not reveal any narrowing of the anastomosis or kinking of the graft. However, transesophageal echocardiography confirmed that the internal felt strip had become inverted by the blood flow. Reoperation was performed to redo the proximal anastomosis, while also removing the internal felt strip. Hemolysis diminished soon after the reoperation. We encountered a case of acute aortic dissection that required reoperation because of hemolytic anemia caused by internal felt strip inversion. Further measures are required to prevent hemolysis with felt strips."

Sutimlimab, a humanized monoclonal IgG4 antibody that binds to and inactivates the complement protein C1s, is a complement inhibitor used for the treatment of CAD. However, there are no reports of its use in aortic surgery that required hypothermic circulatory arrest. We describe the case of an 80-year-old female with acute type A aortic dissection and a 55-mm ascending aortic aneurysm. The patient was scheduled to undergo urgent surgery for type A aortic dissection and aortic aneurysm; however, CAD was detected. Under consultation with hematologists, sutimlimab was initiated three days before surgery for CAD. Partial arch replacement was performed by using the elephant trunk technique under mild hypothermic circulatory arrest with cerebral perfusion and cold cardioplegia. The postoperative course was uneventful. On postoperative day 18, the patient was discharged without any hemolysis-related deficits. Herein, we report a case of partial arch replacement with mild hypothermic circulatory arrest for type A aortic dissection and an aortic aneurysm with CAD after sutimlimab treatment. There are no established methods for the perioperative management of patients with preexisting cold agglutination disease undergoing cardiovascular surgery requiring hypothermic circulatory arrest. Sutimlimab, an anti-complement (C1s) monoclonal antibody, is relatively easy to administer and may help avoid postoperative hemolytic complications."

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Cardiac surgery centers from multiple institutions. Six studies comprising 2,150 adult patients undergoing ATAAD repair, of whom 906 (42.1%) received intraoperative aPRP. Use of intraoperative aPRP versus no aPRP during ATAAD repair. Primary outcomes included reoperation for bleeding and allogeneic blood product transfusion volumes. Secondary outcomes were mechanical ventilation duration, hospital stay, and postoperative complications. aPRP was associated with significantly shorter mechanical ventilation time (MD -13.8 hours; 95% CI -23.9 to -3.7; p = 0.008), lower incidence of prolonged ventilation (OR 0.3; 95% CI 0.2 to 0.7; p = 0.004), reduced reoperation rates (OR 0.4; 95% CI 0.2 to 0.7; p = 0.005), and decreased platelet (MD -2.2 units; 95% CI -3.5 to -0.9; p = 0.001) and cryoprecipitate use (MD -1.9 units; 95% CI -3.0 to -0.8; p < 0.001). No differences were observed in mortality, hospital stay, or rates of neurological or renal complications. Subgroup analysis of randomized controlled trial and propensity-matched data confirmed several of these findings and additionally showed reduced plasma transfusion volumes. In ATAAD surgery, aPRP may reduce transfusion needs, reoperations, and ventilation duration without increasing adverse outcomes. Given that most evidence is observational, high-quality randomized trials are needed to confirm these findings."

We aimed to identify clinical and temporal factors associated with mortality after AAD. We performed a retrospective cohort study across four tertiary hospitals of type A and type B AADs diagnosed over a 20-year period. The outcomes of the study were in-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, and mid-term (6-month) mortality. Univariate linear and bivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the relationship between mortality and demographic and clinical factors. The study included 149 AAD patients. Of these, 103 (69.1 %) were Stanford type A and 46 (30.9 %) Stanford type B. In-hospital mortality was 29.1 % (n = 30) for type A vs 10.9 % (n = 5) for type B. For type A patients, every one-year increase in age increased odds of in-hospital mortality by 4 % (p = 0.0076), and odds of in-hospital mortality were 10.9 times greater with conservative management than surgical (p < 0.0001). Patients with type A dissection had odds of in-hospital mortality 3.0 times greater than type B (p = 0.0005). 30-day mortality rate was 29.1 % (n = 30) for type A dissection vs 10.9 % (n = 5) for type B. 6-month mortality rate was 30.1 % (n = 31) for type A dissection vs 10.9 % (n = 5) for type B. Predictors of 30-day and 6-month mortality were similar to those of in-hospital mortality. Even with tertiary care AAD carries a high burden of mortality. Those with type A dissections, increased age, and non-surgical management are at an increased risk of mortality."

A 72-year-old woman underwent TAR for an ascending aortic aneurysm. Aortic dissection extending to the right carotid artery was detected immediately after the aortic arch graft anastomosis, which resulted in severe stenosis and decreased cerebral perfusion. Therefore, urgent revascularization was deemed necessary. The aortic arch graft was directly punctured, followed by the placement of 3 stents to seal the dissection. Postoperative imaging confirmed the restoration of blood flow without ischemic complications. The patient, who recovered without neurological deficits or cardiosurgical complications, has remained event-free for 3 years after the intervention. Direct puncture of the aortic arch graft provides a reliable and rapid access route for CAS in patients undergoing carotid artery dissection following TAR. This method may serve as an alternative when conventional access is difficult. Antithrombotic therapy should be strictly controlled to avoid procedure-related complications."

    "abstract": "Thoracic blunt injuries are not uncommon, and they can cause severe cardiac and major vascular damage, leading to high mortality. Blunt cardiac rupture and traumatic aortic dissection are the primary fatal outcomes of these injuries. Many patients do not survive long enough to reach the hospital, and even those who present to emergency departments face challenges in timely diagnosis and management. This narrative review was conducted in accordance with the core principles of the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles. A literature search was performed to summarize current evidence on blunt cardiac rupture and traumatic aortic dissection in thoracic blunt trauma settings. Early recognition of life-threatening complications from thoracic blunt trauma is essential for prompt and accurate diagnosis as well as appropriate clinical interventions. Cardiac rupture and traumatic aortic dissection from thoracic blunt trauma have traditionally been considered distinct entities, exhibiting different injury mechanisms and clinical outcomes. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the etiology, injury mechanisms, diagnosis, and management of fatal cardiac rupture and aortic dissection resulting from thoracic blunt trauma. The review is limited by the scarcity of high-quality studies and the predominance of case reports, but it highlights critical patterns in diagnosis and management that may inform clinical practice and guide future research. Overall, the findings underscore that improved understanding and awareness of these conditions can facilitate earlier diagnosis and treatment, ultimately reducing mortality and improving patient care in real-world clinical settings."

Preoperative laboratory parameters, intraoperative strategies, and postoperative outcomes were compared. Kaplan-Meier analysis evaluated long-term survival. Patients with malperfusion presented with significantly higher D-dimer and creatinine levels and more frequent emergency surgery (73.8% vs. 63.9%, P = 0.028).

Herein, we report a case of delayed hemothorax owing to aortic injury following blunt chest trauma, which was successfully treated through emergency surgery. A woman in her 70s fell on an escalator at a train station and was brought to our emergency department. Initial evaluation with computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed a thoracic vertebral fracture, bilateral lower rib fractures, and a right-sided hemothorax. She was admitted for observation and supportive care, and her condition remained stable for days. On day 9 of hospitalization, the patient suddenly experienced cardiac arrest. A plain chest X-ray showed a massive pleural effusion on the left side, prompting the insertion of a chest tube. The drainage was hemorrhagic, and laboratory tests showed a significant decline in the hemoglobin level to 4.9 g/dL. Following successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the return of spontaneous circulation, a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest was performed. However, no active extravasation or apparent source of bleeding was observed. Owing to ongoing hemodynamic instability and the substantial volume of hemothorax, emergency surgery was conducted to identify and control the source of hemorrhage. Intraoperatively, after evacuating a large hematoma from the left thoracic cavity, a small ulcerated hole was identified in the descending thoracic aorta, which appeared tortuous. Pulsatile bleeding was observed from this site. Manual compression was applied to achieve temporary homeostasis. Intraoperative ultrasound showed no evidence of aortic dissection. The bleeding site was sutured directly, and hemostasis was achieved. No additional significant intrathoracic injuries were identified. The aortic injury had resulted from mechanical irritation or penetration by the adjacent fractured lower rib. This represented a case of delayed hemothorax secondary to traumatic aortic injury, a rare but potentially fatal complication. In cases of delayed hemothorax following blunt thoracic trauma-particularly with fractures of the lower left posterior ribs, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for aortic injury. Prompt recognition and surgical intervention are critical for patient survival in such cases."

However, several complications associated with FET have been reported, including distal stent graft-induced new entry (dSINE), which potentially results in aortic rupture and late mortality. Frozenix Partial ET (Japan Lifeline Inc., Tokyo, Japan) is a unique FET device that has a non-stent zone at the distal 2 cm end to decrease the radial force to lower the incidence of dSINE. Owing to its novelty, there are few preceding literatures regarding its efficacy and complications. In this report, we present a case of an unanticipated complication arising from the use of Frozenix Partial ET subsequent to the initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). A 54-year-old male diagnosed with Stanford type A acute aortic dissection underwent emergency total aortic arch replacement, frozen elephant trunk with Frozenix partial ET (Japan Lifeline Inc., Tokyo, Japan), the Bentall procedure, and coronary artery bypass grafting. The patient developed cardiogenic shock, requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with left common femoral artery and vein cannulation on postoperative day 1. Despite adequate ECMO flow, high doses of catecholamines were required to maintain blood pressure measured at the right radial artery. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed stenosis of the distal part of the FET presumably due to retrograde perfusion from the femoral artery. The addition of left axillary artery cannulation improved systemic circulation, reducing the dose of catecholamine. Although designed to reduce the risk of dSINE, Frozenix Partial ET may induce unforeseen complications. Particularly, its non-stent distal part can become stenotic under conditions of retrograde perfusion. Surgeons should carefully choose where to cannulate in patients with this device requiring redo surgery or ECMO support."

Here, we report a case in which a patient was diagnosed with perforation of the 4th portion of the duodenum 2 days after injury in a traffic accident. A 67-year-old woman was transported to our hospital after driving a car that collided with a wall. A seat belt mark was observed on her abdomen. A CT scan performed on the day of the injury confirmed a small poorly enhanced area in the duodenum, but no obvious signs of intestinal perforation were found. CT scan also revealed abdominal aortic dissection, a right clavicle fracture, and bilateral rib fractures. Two days later, a CT scan revealed expansion of the poorly enhanced area of the intestinal wall and a small amount of free air in the 4th portion of the duodenum. As duodenal perforation was suspected, emergency surgery was performed. Laparoscopic surgery was performed, and a quarter-circumferential perforation was found in the 4th portion of the duodenum. The perforation was closed with barbed sutures. The patient began oral intake of fluids on POD 7. The abdominal aortic dissection improved with conservative treatment, and the patient was discharged on POD 60 without any postoperative complications. We report a case of duodenal injury and abdominal aortic dissection caused by a seat belt during a collision. The reason may be that the seat belt moved toward the upper abdomen during the collision, causing compression of the abdominal organs between the seat belt and the spine. Considering the possibility of delayed duodenal perforation, it is important to perform a CT scan again and select an appropriate treatment according to the situation."

    "abstract": "Cardiac surgery carries a high risk of bleeding. In the event of massive bleeding, the administration of rFVIIa may be necessary. However, due to the thromboembolic risk, the use of this factor is only recommended for severe bleeding that does not respond to standard treatments. Our aim was to describe the use of rFVIIa in bleeding situations in cardiac surgery and the thromboembolic events after administration. This is a monocentric observational study including patients who received rFVIIa from January 2019 to December 2021 for the treatment of massive bleeding associated with cardiac surgery. Data collected included population characteristics, surgery, bleeding management, rFVIIa prescription and incidence of postoperative thromboembolic events. A total of 67 patients were included. Most of the operations were for aortic dissection (46%) and valve replacement (33%), and 54% of the cases were urgent procedures. Labile blood products were systematically used in the treatment of bleeding. The average total dose of rFVIIa per patient was 10±5mg, i.e. an average total dose/weight of 129±67μg/kg. Postoperative thromboembolic events occurred in 22 patients (33%), in 73% of cases in the superior vena cava (head, neck and upper extremities). Our study allowed us to describe the use of rFVIIa in massive bleeding in cardiac surgery. The average total dose of rFVIIa administered was higher in patients with thromboembolic events than in those who did not. A more robust study will be conducted to investigate the attributability of rFVIIa to the occurrence of postoperative thromboembolic events."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) is a high-mortality cardiovascular emergency with unclear pathophysiological mechanisms. This study investigated S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9) as a therapeutic target for AD and explored its underlying mechanisms. Proteomic analysis compared aortic tissues from patients with acute type A and matched non-dissected vascular tissues from the same patients. An AD model was induced in wild-type and S100A9 knockout mice via β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN). Survival, aortic diameter, and S100A9 expression were quantified. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing was used to analyze cell populations and mitochondrial pathways in AD mice treated with an S100A9 inhibitor. Finally, the effect of S100A9 on mitochondrial function was investigated in Tohoku Hospital Pediatrics-1 (THP-1) cells. Proteomics identified that S100A9 is significantly upregulated in AD tissue. Furthermore, S100a9 knockout (S100a9 KO) mice conferred protection against AD-induced mortality and aortic dilation. Single-cell RNA analysis revealed that S100A9 is predominantly expressed within the granulocyte population. S100A9 inhibition activated mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathways and upregulated mtDNA-encoded gene expression. Human tissue mRNA levels confirmed decreased mtDNA in AD. Moreover, recombinant human S100A9 and angiotensin-II treatment in THP-1 cells reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and increased oxidative stress. S100A9 is a potential contributor to AD pathogenesis. Inhibition of S100A9 might be a promising therapeutic target for AD."

Traditional diagnostic methods, such as computed tomography (CT) and CT angiography (CTA), are often time-consuming and fail to meet the urgent need for rapid triage in emergency settings. We developed a multimodal model that integrates Bio-ClinicalBERT and ensemble learning (AdaBoost, Gradient boosting, and XGBoost) based on 41 382 patient data from April 1, 2013 to April 1, 2025 at Chongqing Daping Hospital. By integrating clinical texts and laboratory indicators, the model aims to classify the 3 major causes of fatal chest pain (acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, and aortic dissection), as well as other causes of chest pain, aiding rapid triage. We adopt strict data preprocessing and rank importance feature selection. The multimodal fusion model based on Gradient boosting exhibits the best performance: accuracy of 88.40%, area under the curve of 0.951, F1-score of 74.56%, precision of 77.50%, and recall of 72.52%. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis confirmed the clinical relevance of key features such as d-dimer and high-sensitivity troponin. When reducing the number of numerical features to 30 key indicators, the model enhanced robustness without compromising performance. We developed an artificial intelligence model for chest pain classification that effectively addresses the problem of overlapping clinical symptoms through multimodal fusion, and the model has high accuracy. However, future work needs to better integrate model development with clinical workflows and practical constraints."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a life-threatening cardiovascular emergency characterized by aortic layer separation and false lumen formation, with high mortality rates. Emerging evidence highlights the critical role of innate immunity in AD pathogenesis. Innate immune activation drives AAD progression through multiple mechanisms, including macrophage polarization (M1/M2 imbalance), neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, and inflammasome activation. These processes amplify vascular inflammation via cytokine storms (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) and oxidative stress, further promoting matrix metalloproteinase activation and smooth muscle cell phenotypic switching. The cGAS-STING pathway, triggered by mitochondrial DNA release, and TLR signaling act as central hubs connecting vascular injury to innate immune responses. This review synthesizes recent advances in the molecular mechanisms of AAD, focusing on aortic wall structural alterations, dysregulated signaling pathway, including TGF-β, Ang II, STING, and TLR cascades, and immune-inflammatory responses mediated by innate immune components. A deeper understanding of these innate immune components may lead to improved diagnostic biomarkers and targeted therapies for AAD management."

Until CE marking of a dedicated stent in late 2024, a variety of BSG were used. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of the iCover stent graft in this application. Patients and methods: We retrospectively analysed 22 consecutive patients treated at our institution with FEVAR and BEVAR between 05/2023 and 09/2024. The primary endpoint is a composite of target vessel (TV) technical success and freedom from target vessel instability (TVI) in the early and short-/mid-term phase. Secondary endpoints consisted of early, short- and mid-term clinical outcomes. Results: Ninety-seven iCover stent grafts were used to bridge 90 target vessels: 23 for the coeliac arteries (CA), 23 for the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and 50 for the renal arteries (RA); one iCover stent could not be implanted. The underlying aortic pathology was juxtarenal and pararenal aneurysm (12/22; 54,5%), penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU) (2/22; 9%), type Ia endoleak following infrarenal EVAR (3/22; 13,6%), chronic type B aortic dissection with aneurysmal degeneration (1/22; 4,5%), Safi type IV (3/22; 13.6%) and Safi type V (1/22; 4.5%) thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA). The mean aneurysm diameter was 60,5 mm (+/- 10,6 mm). Four (18,2%) patients underwent urgent procedures. The median follow-up was 291,5 days (IQR 63-425,2). 3 patients (13,6%) died from non-aneurysm-related causes. Assisted primary TV technical success was 98,88% (89/90). One non-iCover related loss of TV was excluded from mid-term analysis. The TV patency was 98,88% (89/90) in the early phase and 98,87% (88/89) at mid-term follow-up. Cumulative freedom from TVI was 92,13% (82/89). Conclusions: The iCover is effective and safe to use as a BSG in fenestrated endovascular aortic repair. Our results align with the available literature, but further studies are needed to validate iCover as BGS, especially in BEVAR."

The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological and thanatological features of sudden deaths due to aortic dissection. We conducted a retrospective descriptive study of autopsy-confirmed cases over a 12-year period (2011-2023). Aortic dissection accounted for 3.28 % of all sudden deaths. The mean age of the deceased was 54.7 years (range: 19-82 years), with a male predominance (sex ratio M/F = 9). Hypertension was identified in 37.5 % of cases, and Marfan syndrome in 10 %, all in individuals under 40 years of age. Chest pain was reported in 25 % of cases, while discomfort was the most frequent symptom (30 %). The ascending aorta was involved in 60 % of cases. Cardiac tamponade was the most common cause of death (62.5 %), mainly related to type A dissections (92 %). The events occurred predominantly in the morning. In 48 % of cases, individuals were found deceased at home. Sudden death due to aortic dissection occurs most often without prior diagnosis and affects a relatively young, predominantly male population.

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a life-threatening cardiovascular emergency frequently associated with misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. This paper aims to illustrate the diagnostic challenges of AAD in rehabilitation settings by presenting a case with atypical musculoskeletal symptoms and emphasize the importance of considering vascular emergencies with literature review. A 46-year-old male presented to a rehabilitation center with migrating right shoulder pain and proximal weakness. Initial complaint suggested a musculoskeletal disorder; however, further evaluation revealed hypertension, tachycardia, and migratory, intensifying pain. A subsequent computed tomography angiography confirmed AAD. The patient underwent urgent Sun's procedure, including ascending aorta and total arch replacement with stented elephant trunk implantation, which was followed by multidisciplinary rehabilitation due to the secondary ischemic stroke. The patient's early symptoms closely mimicked musculoskeletal disorders, which delayed his prioritization of seeking medical service. After cardiovascular evaluation and successful aortic repair, the AAD was stabilized. However, he later developed right-sided hemiplegia as a secondary complication and was referred back for neurological rehabilitation, which included repetitive task training, robot-assisted therapy, and functional electrical stimulation. Three months post-surgery, he demonstrated significant functional recovery, with Fugl-Meyer Assessment scores improving from 12/66 to 58/66 for the upper extremity and from 17/34 to 32/34 for the lower extremity. This case and literature review highlight the diagnostic challenges of AAD presenting as musculoskeletal pain and underscores the need for rehabilitation specialists to maintain a broad differential diagnosis. A high index of suspicion is essential for early recognition and timely referral, especially in patients with overlapping symptoms and vascular risk factors. This case adds to the limited body of evidence on AAD presenting with musculoskeletal complaints and may serve to raise clinical awareness. Further studies, including case series and systematic investigations, are needed to better characterize such atypical presentations and guide diagnostic pathways in rehabilitation settings."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic syndromes (AS), including aortic dissection, ulceration, and intramural hematoma, are rare and life-threatening diagnoses. Early diagnosis is critical as mortality increases by 1-2% per hour after symptom onset. D-dimer (DD) < 500 ng/dL, with or without utilization of Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score (ADD-RS), is a proposed method to rule-out AS in low-risk patients but is not specific. Age-adjusted D-dimer (AADD) has been validated for pulmonary embolism, but has not been studied extensively in AS. In this study, we investigate the utility of AADD to DD when used to rule-out AS, with and without ADD-RS. This is a retrospective study of patients presenting the emergency department (ED) from 2012 to 2021 who received a DD and underwent computed tomography angiography (CTA) for Dissection, Coronary Study, or Triple Rule-Out. Sensitivity and specificity for AS was calculated for both DD < 500 ng/dL and AADD. Patients were excluded if they were pregnant, had prior thoracic aortic dissection or repair, presented altered, or younger than 18 years-old. In total, 5818 unique cases met inclusion criteria. In the DD < 500 ng/dL group sensitivity was 0.979 (0.939-1.000) with a specificity of 0.727 (0.716-0.739). In the AADD group, sensitivity was 0.938 (0.869-1.000, p = 0.16) with a specificity of 0.781 (0.770-0.792, p < 0.05). AADD appears to have comparable sensitivity, although with a diminished confidence interval, to DD when ruling out AS. Utilization of ADD-RS may help determine which patients are appropriate for screening. Future steps would include a prospective trial on patients presenting to the ED."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic syndromes (AAS) include a spectrum of life-threatening conditions that pose considerable diagnostic challenges, particularly in emergency care settings. Clinical scores and circulating biomarkers have become essential in improving diagnostic accuracy, risk stratification, and guiding clinical decision-making. Tools such as the Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score (ADD-RS) and the AORTAs score offer structured methods for identifying patients at elevated risk; however, their diagnostic performance can be further enhanced through integration with biomarker testing and imaging modalities. Biomarkers including D-dimer, NT-proBNP, cardiac troponins, and novel candidates such as soluble ST2 (sST2) and matrix metalloproteinase-8 and 9 (MMP-8, MMP-9), have demonstrated potential in refining diagnostic and prognostic assessments with an outstanding sensibility. ADAMTS-1 and ADAMTS-4 appear to have the best diagnostic accuracy, whereas certain non-coding DNAs (miR-15a) achieve an exceptionally high negative predictive value. These biomarkers reflect key underlying mechanisms such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular injury, offering valuable insights into disease severity and progression. However, limitations related to specificity, inter-cohort variability, and assay standardization currently hinder their widespread clinical adoption. Further validation through large-scale, multi-center studies is essential to establish their role within integrated diagnostic pathways."

    "abstract": "Aortic arch surgery remains associated with significant mortality and morbidity especially in the setting of acute type A aortic dissection. Adequate cerebral protection is essential, and several methods have been proposed to avoid neurological injury during aortic arch surgery. The most common techniques include selective antegrade perfusion of brachiocephalic arteries or an interval of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. A range of cannulation strategies have been employed safely to provide adequate cerebral protection. Optimal cannulation selection is based on the consideration of air or particulate embolism risk; limitation in operative field visibility; end organ perfusion; and interactions with surgical maneuvers. Overall, no technique has been shown to fully mitigate the risk of neurological injury, rather each has utility in different scenarios. Innominate artery cannulation offers high flows on CPB and avoids additional incisions. Right axillary artery is rarely involved in aortic dissections, versatile for use in redo surgery, and altered blood flow patterns reduce embolic stroke rates. Left axillary artery can be utilized when both right axillary and femoral arteries are involved in a dissection process. Novel bi-axillary approach has additionally shown good results. Future multicenter, randomized trials should focus on establishing the relative benefits and risks of each cannulation approach with the aim of delineating the optimal cannulation strategy for different clinical situations to guide aortic surgeons, particularly in the emergency setting of aortic dissection."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) is a life-threatening vascular emergency characterized by vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) dysfunction and extracellular matrix degradation. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a pro-inflammatory cytokine implicated in vascular remodeling, has been suggested to play a role in AD, yet its mechanistic contribution remains unclear. We integrated bulk and single-cell transcriptomic analyses with validation in human and murine AD tissues. Functional roles of MIF were explored using MIF knockout mice, pharmacological inhibition (ISO-1), and adeno-associated virus-mediated overexpression. Mechanistic studies in primary VSMCs examined autophagy flux, AKT/mTOR signaling, and phenotypic switching. Pharmacological modulation with rapamycin and chloroquine was performed to assess autophagy's role. MIF was markedly upregulated in AD tissues, especially in VSMCs. MIF deficiency or ISO-1 treatment significantly reduced AD incidence, rupture, and aortic dilation, while overexpression aggravated disease progression. Mechanistically, MIF suppressed autophagy by activating AKT/mTOR signaling, promoting the synthetic VSMC phenotype. Restoration of autophagy with rapamycin reversed MIF-induced phenotypic switching, whereas chloroquine exacerbated AD. Furthermore, AKT silencing abolished the pathological effects of MIF, and receptor-blocking experiments indicated that CD74 and CXCR2 mediate MIF-driven signaling. MIF is a critical regulator of VSMC phenotypic switching in AD through AKT/mTOR-mediated autophagy suppression. Targeting MIF or enhancing autophagy represents a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing AD progression."

It offers dynamic information similar to computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but without radiation exposure, making repeated assessments feasible. During cardiovascular surgery, TEE guides cannula placement, monitors myocardial protection, detects complications like air embolism and intraoperative aortic dissection, and facilitates real-time surgical navigation. Its utility extends to postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) care and emergency settings, where it helps diagnose complications when CT is not feasible. In thoracic surgery, TEE aids in assessing tumor invasion into cardiovascular structures. However, TEE's effectiveness heavily relies on the operator's skill, unlike the objectivity of radiologic modalities. Thus, fostering collaboration between anesthesiologists and surgeons is essential. As a critical part of perioperative management, TEE proficiency is now a requirement for board certification in cardiovascular anesthesia in Japan. Supporting anesthesiologists in developing TEE skills enhances surgical outcomes and institutional capability."

Interhospital distance was measured in kilometres and minutes using a navigation application. Among 176 patients, 14 interhospital mortalities (8.0%) occurred after the transfer request, with a median interhospital distance of 47 minutes. Significant risk factors for interhospital mortality included pericardial effusion (odds ratio [OR]: 4.03; 95% CI: 1.29-12.64), shock (OR: 97.84; 95% CI: 12.11-790.65), and cardiopulmonary resuscitation before referral (OR: 64.40; 95% CI: 6.57-631.20).

    "abstract": "Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has replaced open surgery for descending thoracic aortic pathology. Achieving a suitable proximal seal may necessitate hybrid repair involving cervical debranching, which carries risks. Alternatively, if a total endovascular solution is being attempted, parallel grafts or physician modified devices can be used. These have not, however, been designed specifically for this purpose. Branched thoracic endografts represent an evolution in stent graft design for the aortic arch. Single branched off the shelf designs are available, but multibranched designs are custom made, limiting their emergency use. Here, the successful use of a repurposed custom made triple branched endograft for a complicated acute type B aortic dissection (TBAD) with rapid false lumen expansion is reported. An 84 year old man presented with a three day history of chest pain and worsening breathlessness. He had had a previous episode of acute TBAD a month earlier, managed with blood pressure control. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed a left pleural effusion and an aortic dissection extending from the left subclavian artery to the aortic bifurcation. The proximal descending aortic diameter had rapidly expanded to 67 mm. To treat the patient, a custom made triple branched endograft, initially intended for a different patient, was used. Follow up CTA showed satisfactory positioning of the stent graft with no evidence of endoleak, complete false lumen thrombosis, and satisfactory aortic remodelling. Acute TBAD remains a significant therapeutic challenge, especially when complications arise. TEVAR is recommended, but standard endografts may require full head and neck vessel debranching to ensure a proximal seal, which can be achieved by either open surgery or through endovascular means. This case demonstrates the applicability of a multibranched arch endograft in the emergency setting, which fortunately was available in the unit. Although these cases are rare, it is believed that development of a three vessel off the shelf solution should be considered."

Still, it may also present with atypical symptoms and signs of end-organ vascular compromise. We present a case of a 57-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension with poor medication adherence, major depressive disorder, chronic low back pain, and cocaine use disorder, who initially presented to the ED with worsening chronic low back pain, which was attributed to a musculoskeletal origin. She received analgesics, which improved the pain. Approximately 7 hours after presentation, the following morning, the patient developed acute-onset chest pain, prompting repeat evaluation, including an electrocardiogram and cardiac biomarkers, which revealed T-wave inversion in the lateral leads and elevated troponin levels. Based on these findings, the non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) protocol was initiated. While the back pain and chest pain improved, her kidney function continued to rapidly deteriorate from the time of admission, prompting the team to perform a sonogram and subsequently an abdominal CT, which revealed a heterogeneous, hyperechoic right kidney with loss of corticomedullary distinction and possible aortic pathology. A CT angiogram of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis confirmed a type A aortic dissection extending from the aortic root to the iliac bifurcation. The dissection caused significant narrowing at the origin of the left common carotid artery and partial infarction of the right kidney due to involvement of the renal artery. The patient was transferred to a tertiary hospital for surgical intervention and remained hemodynamically stable; however, she opted against surgical intervention and left against medical advice despite extensive counseling. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for aortic dissection in patients with unexplained back pain, particularly when there are signs of multiorgan ischemia."

One hundred fifty-three patients with iliofemoral and/or renal malperfusion underwent emergent central aortic repair alone (conventional group; n = 102) or central repair plus FET (FET group; n = 51). Univariate statistics were used to compare the 2 groups. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with postoperative limb revascularization and new renal failure. Selection bias was addressed through inverse-probability treatment weighting adjustment. Age and preoperative comorbidities were equivalent in the 2 groups. Limb ischemia requiring revascularization (17.6% for conventional vs 15.7% for FET; P = .856), or new dialysis (21.6% for conventional vs 17.6% for FET; P = .547) also was similar between the groups. Multivariable regression did not identify FET as independently associated with a reduced need for limb revascularization in iliofemoral malperfusion patients (odds ratio [OR], 1.334; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.434-4.098; P = .614) or with avoiding dialysis in renal malperfusion patients (OR, 1.166; 95% CI, 0.252-5.382; P = .844). Mid-term survival (71.1% for conventional 71.1% vs 75.5% for FET; log-rank P = .753) and distal reintervention-free survival (64.9% for conventional vs 69.4% for FET; log-rank P = .902) were equivalent. The addition of FET to conventional repair did not impact limb revascularization, new dialysis, or mid-term reintervention or improve mid-term survival in ATAAD with iliofemoral or renal malperfusion."

    "abstract": "Ascending aorta mycotic pseudoaneurysms are an uncommon condition. The best treatment is controversial, including surgical treatment, endovascular treatment, or a combination of both. A 44-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with history of a type B aortic dissection 1 year ago. He was successfully treated with hybrid therapy, aortic cerclage, and carotid bridge plus endoprosthesis implantation. During his follow-up, an ascending aorta mycotic pseudoaneurysm was documented by computed tomography scan. Two-stage hybrid therapy with brachiocephalic trunk debranching and a zone zero thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) were then successfully performed. Endovascular repair as emergency therapy for aorta or aortic graft infection is feasible and may well serve as a definite treatment option in selected cases, as high surgical risk patients. It is possible to perform endovascular repair of mycotic aortic aneurysm as a late complication of TEVAR of aortic type B dissection."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) typically affects older patients with hypertension or connective tissue disorders; occurrence in young adults without identifiable risk factors is rare and diagnostically challenging. A healthy 41-year-old man presented with sudden severe chest pain, markedly elevated blood pressure, and tachycardia. Computed tomography angiography revealed extensive ATAAD involving multiple major vessels. Emergency surgery, including aortic root replacement and frozen elephant trunk repair, was complicated by severe postoperative coagulopathy, end-organ failure, and brain death. Approximately 30% of ATAAD cases are initially misdiagnosed, particularly in young patients with atypical presentations. This case highlights the importance of diagnostic suspicion even without traditional risk factors, and it reinforces recent guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommending screening aortic imaging and genetic counseling of first-degree relatives, aiding preventive management. It is important to maintain high suspicion for ATAAD in young patients. Rapid imaging, immediate surgical intervention, and family screening are essential."

We report the case of a 66-year-old man with AAD and left coronary malperfusion who underwent emergency surgery. A saphenous vein graft was anastomosed to the LAD before aortic cross-clamping, enabling early reperfusion from the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. Myocardial function improved markedly during surgery. The patient was successfully weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass and discharged on postoperative day 20 with improved cardiac function. This case highlights the benefit of initiating coronary perfusion prior to aortic cross-clamping as a strategy to improve outcomes in AAD with coronary malperfusion."

    "abstract": "Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by platelet destruction. While most patients respond to first- or second-line therapies, a small subset is multirefractory. Fostamatinib, an oral spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor, is a therapeutic option in these cases. We report a case of an acute aortic dissection (AAD) occurring in a patient without traditional cardiovascular risk factors, 3 months after fostamatinib initiation. A 70-year-old woman with a 30-year history of ITP, unresponsive to multiple therapies, was treated with fostamatinib and achieved a complete haematologic response. She presented with sudden chest pain and was diagnosed with Stanford A (DeBakey type 1) AAD requiring emergency surgery. Histological analysis of her aortic tissue showed a 25% reduction in phosphorylated SYK expression compared to a control sample, without alteration in smooth muscle cell markers. The absence of predisposing conditions (hypertension, smoking, genetic disorders) led us to explore a potential link between fostamatinib and AAD. Experimental data suggest that SYK inhibition exacerbates aortic wall vulnerability, and off-target effects of fostamatinib on VEGF receptors may further weaken vascular integrity. This case highlights a possible association between fostamatinib and AAD, potentially mediated by SYK and VEGFR inhibition. While causality cannot be definitively established, clinicians should be vigilant when prescribing fostamatinib, even in patients without known risk factors for AAD. Further studies are needed to clarify the vascular safety profile of fostamatinib in ITP and other settings."

    "abstract": "Acute Type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a critical cardiovascular emergency characterized by high mortality rates and complex management challenges. The presence of a tear in the ascending aorta often extends into the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta, leading to malperfusion syndrome, a severe condition resulting from obstructed blood flow to vital organs. Despite the high risks associated with ATAAD, the use of Peripheral Veno-Arterial (VA), Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) remains controversial. This intervention aims to maintain systemic circulation and organ perfusion, potentially stabilizing patients prior to surgical repair. A narrative review of the literature was conducted through a comprehensive search of PubMed and Embase databases, covering the period from January 2000 to March 2025. Keywords included \"ECMO\", \"Type A Aortic Dissection\", \"malperfusion\", and \"bridge to surgery\", among others. Although this is a narrative review, the methodology was guided by the PRISMA guidelines to ensure transparency and reproducibility in the selection and reporting of the included studies. Ten relevant articles were identified, including observational studies, case series, and reviews. This narrative review presents the role of peripheral VA ECMO in managing ATAAD, focusing on the timing of ECMO initiation and its implications for patient outcomes. The approach emphasizes rapid deployment following confirmation that the iliac and femoral arteries are free from dissection involvement, ensuring safe cannulation and effective circulatory support. The discussion also explores ECMO's role as a bridge to surgery, detailing its impact on preventing malperfusion to critical organs such as the brain, kidneys, and splanchnic organs. While VA ECMO offers a potential lifeline for patients with severe ATAAD, its application must be carefully considered within an integrated treatment strategy. The ongoing debate and emerging research underscore the need for further studies to define clear guidelines and optimize ECMO's use in this high-risk patient population. The balance between preventing malperfusion and managing increased myocardial workload presents a complex clinical challenge, necessitating continued investigation and dialogue within the medical community."

    "abstract": "Patients presenting to the emergency department with acute thoracic aortic dissection (ATAD) often experience chest pain that requires urgent intervention. However, other chest pain-related emergencies, such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and acute pulmonary embolism (PE), are far more common and frequently overshadow ATAD. This disparity leads to a high rate of ATAD misdiagnosis. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the development of various models utilizing imaging modalities and biomarkers to enable rapid triage and diagnosis of ATAD in emergency settings. This article aims to evaluate the performance and clinical significance of these AI models within the context of clinical workflows. We performed literature searches in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science to identify relevant studies published between 2015 and 2025, with the focus of the differentiation of ATAD patients from other chest pain-related conditions in emergency settings, with the application of AI. Eighteen studies were retrieved from the past ten years, highlighting a significant knowledge gap in the field of translational medicine. The discussion included an overview of AI-powered models for ATAD diagnosis, as well as guidelines on current clinical workflows and the application of AI in clinical settings. This article offers a detailed review of AI models developed for the screening and diagnosis of ATAD. It highlights not only the performance of these technologies but also their clinical importance in facilitating timely interventions for high-risk patients. Looking forward, we anticipate a future where AI and deep learning (DL)-driven ATAD diagnostic models will play a pivotal role in optimizing ATAD clinical management."

    "title": "Diagnostic strategies for suspected acute aortic syndrome: systematic review, meta-analysis, decision-analytic modelling and value of information analysis.",
    "abstract": "Acute aortic syndrome is a life-threatening condition that requires urgent diagnosis with computed tomographic angiography. Diagnostic technologies, including clinical scores and biomarkers, can be used to select patients presenting with potential symptoms of acute aortic syndrome for computed tomographic angiography. We aimed to estimate the accuracy of clinical scores and biomarkers for diagnosing acute aortic syndrome, the cost-effectiveness of alternative diagnostic strategies and the expected value of future research. We searched online databases from inception to February 2024, reference lists of included studies and existing systematic reviews. We included cohort studies evaluating the accuracy of clinical scores or biomarkers for diagnosing acute aortic syndrome compared with a reference standard. Two authors independently selected and extracted data. Risk of bias was appraised using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies-2 tool. Data were synthesised using either a multinomial or a bivariate normal meta-analysis model. We developed a decision-analytic model to simulate the management of a hypothetical cohort of patients attending hospital with possible acute aortic syndrome. We modelled diagnostic strategies that used the Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score and D-dimer to select patients for computed tomographic angiography. We used estimates from our meta-analysis, existing literature and clinical experts to model the consequences of diagnostic strategies upon survival, health utility and healthcare costs. We estimated the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained by each strategy compared to the next most effective alternative on the efficiency frontier, and the expected value of perfect information. Primary meta-analysis included 12 studies of Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score alone, 6 studies of Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score with D-dimer and 18 studies of D-dimer using the 500 ng/ml threshold. Sensitivities and specificities (95% credible intervals) were: Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score > 0 94.6% (90% to 97.5%) and 34.7% (20.7% to 51.2%), Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score > 1 43.4% (31.2% to 57.1%) and 89.3% (80.4% to 94.8%); Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score > 0 or D-dimer > 500 ng/ml 99.8% (98.7% to 100%) and 21.8% (12.1% to 32.6%); Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score > 1 or D-dimer > 500 ng/ml 98.3% (94.9% to 99.5%) and 51.4% (38.7% to 64.1%); Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score > 1 or Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score = 1 with D-dimer > 500 ng/ml 93.1% (87.1% to 96.3%) and 67.1% (54.4% to 77.7%); and D-dimer alone 96.5% (94.8% to 98%) and 56.2% (48.3% to 63.9%). We identified 11 cohort studies of other biomarkers, but accuracy estimates were limited and inconsistent. Decision-analytic modelling showed that applying diagnostic strategies to an unselected population (acute aortic syndrome prevalence 0.26%) resulted in high rates of computed tomographic angiography, and only the strategy selecting patients with Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score > 1 for computed tomographic angiography was cost-effective. If clinicians can select a population for investigation with higher acute aortic syndrome prevalence (0.61%), then using a strategy of Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score > 1 or Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score = 1 with D-dimer > 500 ng/ml or a strategy of Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score > 1 or D-dimer > 500 ng/ml to select patients for computed tomographic angiography is cost-effective and deliverable. At a threshold of £20,000/quality-adjusted life-year, population expected value of perfect information was around £17.75M. Studies included in the meta-analysis showed substantial heterogeneity in estimates of specificity. In the modelling, there was substantial uncertainty around what constitutes suspected acute aortic syndrome and the effect of delayed diagnosis. The Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score and D-dimer provide useful diagnostic information and may offer cost-effective strategies for selecting patients for computed tomographic angiography, but their role depends upon how clinicians identify suspected acute aortic syndrome. Primary research is required to compare different combinations of Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score with D-dimer in practice, explore how suspected acute aortic syndrome is identified and evaluate alternative biomarkers. This synopsis presents independent research funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme as award number NIHR151853. An acute aortic syndrome occurs when the main blood vessel from the heart (the aorta) develops damage that can lead to life-threatening bleeding or blockage. It is diagnosed with a specialised scan called a computed tomography angiography. Symptoms of acute aortic syndrome include chest pain, back pain, abdominal pain or fainting. Around 2 million people attend National Health Service emergency departments each year with these symptoms, so we need to decide how we select people for scanning. The Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score uses patient characteristics, symptoms and examination findings to score the risk of aortic syndrome from low (zero points) to high (three points). Blood tests can detect chemicals that are released during aortic damage – most notably, a blood test called D-dimer. We aimed to determine whether the Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score and D-dimer could be used to select patients for scanning. We searched the scientific literature for any research studies that evaluated the accuracy of clinical scores and blood tests for detecting acute aortic syndrome. We used a statistical technique called meta-analysis to combine results from 12 studies of the Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score, 6 studies of the Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score with D-dimer and 18 studies of D-dimer alone. Our analysis showed that nearly all patients with acute aortic syndrome have an Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score above zero or positive D-dimer test. We developed a mathematical model to simulate what would happen if the Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score and/or D-dimer were used to select people with possible acute aortic syndrome for scanning. This showed that using the Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score and D-dimer for all patients with symptoms suggesting acute aortic syndrome would result in high rates of computed tomography scanning. However, if clinicians can identify people for testing whose risk of aortic syndrome is greater than zero, then Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score and D-dimer can be cost-effective in selecting people for a scan."

    "abstract": "Osteogenesis imperfecta is a group of rare, genetically inherited, autosomal dominant connective tissue disorders affecting the production of type-1 collagen. The most common cardiovascular manifestations of the pathology include aortic regurgitation and aortic root disease. Other manifestations remain particularly rare, with only 2 previously reported cases of type B aortic dissection in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta described in the literature. The management of vascular pathology in connective tissue disease remains a significant clinical challenge due to the intrinsic fragility of connective tissues and tendencies to bleed with open surgical repair. This is a case of a 69-year-old with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta presenting with epigastric pain radiating to the back. She had vascular risk factors of hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia. Imaging revealed an acute, uncomplicated Stanford Type B aortic dissection, which was managed with intravenous and then oral beta-blocker therapy. Close imaging surveillance demonstrated stability in the extent of the dissection, and she remains asymptomatic at 6 months of follow-up. Notably, her inpatient stay was complicated by a reactive pleural effusion, which resolved without intervention. Given the rarity of aortic dissection in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta and the lack of clinical evidence to guide decision-making, this case report emphasizes the importance of an individualized approach to management in the acute phase with intensive outpatient surveillance. Awareness of the risks posed by connective tissue fragility in this patient population is essential in guiding both emergency and elective surgical management and long-term care planning."

    "abstract": "In situ laser fenestration (ISLF) of the left subclavian artery (LSA) is a simple and effective method for left subclavian artery revascularization. However, long-term outcome data for this technique are lacking. This study presents our expanded experience with long-term outcomes of ISLF of the LSA in zone 2 thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). A single-center retrospective review of all consecutive patients who underwent zone 2 TEVAR with LSA revascularization by ISLF was performed (2009-2023). This technique was performed through retrograde percutaneous or open brachial arterial access. A thoracic endograft was deployed in zone 2 followed by ISLF using a 2.3-mm laser. A balloon expandable covered stent was placed across the fenestration and post-dilated. Postoperative clinical follow-up and computed tomography angiography were reviewed to assess our endpoints. The primary endpoint was fenestration-related endoleak reintervention (type Ic or IIIc). Secondary endpoints were early and late stroke rates, LSA stent patency, fenestration-related mortality, and aorta-related mortality. Eighty-one patients were included in our series (48 males [59%]; mean age, 60.9 ±12.8 years). Indication for intervention was type B aortic dissection in 67 patients (82.7%). Ninety-two percent of all interventions were urgent or emergent, with 19 patients presenting with rupture (23.5%). ISLF was successfully performed in all 81 cases. The median operative time was 153 minutes. Postintervention stroke occurred in three patients (3.7%) and spinal cord injury in six patients (7.4%; three transient, three permanent). There were nine operative mortalities (11.1%). The median clinical follow-up was 4.3 years (range, 0-12.6 years), and the median imaging follow-up was 4.3 years (range, 0-12.5 years). Three patients (3.7%) were found to have a type 1c endoleak and underwent distal extension of the LSA stent at 6.6, 23.6, and 30.2 months postoperatively. Importantly, there was no fenestration-related type IIIc endoleak or mortality. Primary LSA stent patency was 100% at 1 year, 96.7% at 5 years, and 91.1% at 10 years. Freedom from fenestration-related endoleak reintervention was 98.4% at 1 year, 93.2% at 5 years, and 93.2% at 10 years. There was only one late aortic-related death (1.4%) secondary to multiorgan failure on postoperative day 77 after visceral debranching. ISLF for LSA revascularization is a safe, reproducible, and durable treatment option in TEVAR requiring proximal seal in zone 2. ISLF carries an excellent technical success rate, low fenestration-related complications, and competitive long-term stent patency. Low stroke rate and short operative time further support ISLF as an effective surgical technique for LSA revascularization."

He presented to his local doctor with sudden onset of epicardial pain at around 5:00 p.m. on July 3, XXXX. On the same day, he was transferred to our hospital for extensive intra-abdominal hemorrhage suspected on abdominal computed tomography (CT). During emergency transport, his abdomen was flat, soft, and tender in the pericardial area, and blood biochemistry tests revealed a decreased hemoglobin of 10.2g/dL. He was admitted to our hospital, and conservative treatment was initiated. Five years ago, he underwent Hartmann procedure at another hospital for idiopathic perforation of the sigmoid colon. A month after discharge from the hospital, he had to undergo emergency surgery again at our hospital for colon resection and colostomy reconstruction due to colon perforation at the mouth side of the colostomy. He reported a history of colorectal perforation on the mouth side of the colostomy. After 6 months, a colostomy was performed and he was diagnosed with a terminal illness. Based on a family history of idiopathic colorectal perforation on his mother's side and the ruptured aneurysm, vascular-type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome was suspected. After admission, his symptoms of pericardial pain improved, but a CT scan on the 16th day revealed enlarged hepatic and splenic aneurysms. On July 24, he was transferred to a local hospital for splenic artery aneurysm treatment and underwent coiling the next day. His postoperative course was good, and he was transferred back to our hospital on July 26. He continued to show good progress and was discharged from the hospital on August 1. After discharge, he visited the outpatient genetic clinic for further examination. However, on October 9 of the same year, he developed aortic dissection and passed away."

We enrolled patients who underwent emergent aortic surgery because of ATAAD from 2010 to 2022 from 9 hospitals. Follow-up information was obtained by matching the clinical patient data with a national administrative database. Discrimination and calibration of GERAADA were tested at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years. The relationship between long-term outcome and score was also tested through time-to-event methods. A total of 1110 patients were analysed: Median age was 67 years [IQR 57-75], and 30.8% of subjects were female. Median GERAADA score was 14.3% [10.2-22]. Mean length of follow-up was 4.19 years. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival at 5 and 10 years were, respectively, 62.5% ± 1.5%, and 48.5% ± 2.1%. Discrimination was poor but remained stable over the time (area under the curve [AUC] at 1-year follow-up: 0.66; 95% CI 0.63-0.70. AUC at 10-year follow-up: 0.64; 95% CI 0.61-0.68). Calibration plots showed underprediction until 50%-predicted probability and progressive overprediction afterward. There is a steep mortality in the first couple of months after surgery while afterward the mortality rate is constantly lower. GERAADA score was found to be a predictor of long-term mortality with a nonlinear association. GERAADA score showed a poor performance in predicting long-term survival."

    "title": "Spontaneous Aortic Sealing with Tranexamic Acid in Type A Dissection: A Novel Life-Saving Finding.",
    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is a life-threatening cardiovascular emergency, particularly Stanford type A, which typically necessitates urgent surgical intervention. Despite advances in surgical techniques and perioperative care, preoperative bleeding and coagulopathy remain significant challenges. Tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic agent, is widely used to minimize perioperative bleeding in cardiovascular surgeries; however, its role in the non-surgical, preoperative stabilization of aortic dissection has not been well established. We present the case of a 56-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and dyslipidaemia who presented with sudden-onset, severe interscapular chest pain. Computed tomography angiography revealed an ascending aortic dissection. Initial management included intravenous labetalol for blood pressure and heart rate control, along with the administration of 1 gram of tranexamic acid. She was subsequently transferred for emergent surgical repair. Intraoperatively, however, no active aortic bleeding was identified. Instead, a clot was found sealing the dissected segment of the ascending aorta, effectively halting further propagation and haemorrhage. This unexpected finding led to the cancellation of surgical repair. We hypothesize that tranexamic acid contributed significantly to the formation of this stabilizing clot through its antifibrinolytic effects. The patient's clinical outcome was favourable, with no complications observed. This case highlights a novel potential application of tranexamic acid in the emergency management of aortic dissection. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case in which tranexamic acid contributed to spontaneous thrombus formation within a dissected aortic segment, preventing catastrophic haemorrhage and obviating the need for surgery. This case highlights a potentially important role for tranexamic acid (TXA) in the management of aortic dissection. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of its kind.While its established use in reducing postoperative bleeding and transfusion requirements is well documented, our case demonstrates a preoperative benefit, with TXA contributing to the formation of a stabilizing thrombus within the dissected aortic segment.This life-saving clot prevented further dissection and haemorrhage, ultimately deferring the need for surgical repair and reducing the risk of perioperative complications.We aim to underscore the need for further investigation into the potential role of tranexamic acid in the acute management of aortic dissection."

While its coronary toxicity is well documented, large-vessel complications such as aortic dissection are rarely reported. We present a 65-year-old man with colorectal cancer who developed Stanford type A aortic dissection 3 days after initiating adjuvant capecitabine therapy. Imaging revealed extensive dissection from the ascending to the abdominal aorta. Emergency hemiarch replacement was successfully performed. The absence of prior cardiovascular disease, close temporal relationship, and known vasotoxicity of fluoropyrimidines suggest a likely association. Fluoropyrimidines may induce endothelial injury, vasospasm, and hypertension. A history of smoking in our patient may have contributed to vascular susceptibility. Capecitabine, though well tolerated, may rarely cause life-threatening vascular complications such as aortic dissection. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for atypical vascular symptoms during therapy."

Research indicates that anticoagulation plays a crucial role in the management of newly diagnosed cases of diabetic lower extremity atherosclerotic obliterative disease. However, in the present case, the patient developed dry gangrene in both toes after receiving vasodilator drugs during an emergency intervention for sudden aortic dissection. Given that traditional treatments, such as anticoagulation and transfemoral amputation, may not be appropriate for every case, it is imperative to explore alternative therapeutic options. This case report presents pioneering clinical evidence of a tri-therapeutic strategy integrating biomechanical conditioning transverse tibial bone transport (TTBT), Traditional Chinese Medicine Compress Therapy (TCM-CT), and antibiotic-loaded bone cement (ALBC) for diabetic foot ulcer regeneration. This innovative paradigm demonstrates concurrent activation of mechanobiological signaling pathways, phytochemical bioactivity, and sustained antimicrobial protection, achieving complete epithelialization in refractory neuropathic wounds."

    "abstract": "Trauma-related acute myocardial infarction represents a complex and high-risk condition in the emergency department, necessitating a range of sophisticated treatment strategies. Failure to provide timely and accurate intervention significantly increases the risk of short-term mortality. We present the case of a 36-year-old male who was admitted to local hospital following a penetrating chest trauma. Relevant diagnostic evaluations revealed haemopneumothorax and shock. Following initial stabilization measures, the patient was urgently transferred to our institution due to haemopericardium, which was initially suspected to be secondary to traumatic aortic dissection. However, the admission electrocardiogram clearly demonstrated concurrent anterior and high lateral wall myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. We attempted interventional therapy on the LAD to restore blood flow. However, intraoperative findings revealed complete rupture of the LAD. The patient was transferred to the cardiac surgery department for emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The foreign body was successfully retrieved, and the CABG was completed without complications. The patient gradually recovered under short-term ECMO support and was discharged successfully. Follow-up assessments indicate a favourable recovery. The mechanism underlying traumatic myocardial infarction is complex and variable. Given that emergency physicians and cardiologists often lack extensive experience in such cases, they should exercise caution, conduct a thorough assessment, and meticulously plan each step of diagnosis and treatment."

    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic aneurysm or abdominal aortic aneurysm (TAA/AAA) is a fatal surgical emergency, and time to surgery can be a key factor in improving survival outcomes in patients. In this study, we examined the association between systolic blood pressure on arrival and door-to-surgery time in patients with ruptured TAA/AAA, hypothesizing that patients with ruptured thoracic or abdominal aortic aneurysms without hypotension may have longer door-to-surgery times than those with hypotension. This retrospective study was conducted at two community hospitals, Shonan Kamakura General Hospital and Tokyo Nishi Tokushukai Hospital, in Japan, and included patients with ruptured thoracic or abdominal aortic aneurysms who were admitted to these hospitals from 2010 to 2021. Door-to-surgery time was compared between patients with stable blood pressure (>90 mmHg) and those with hypotension (≤90 mmHg) using multivariable linear regression. Among 94 patients (median age 82 years), 29.8% were in hypotension on arrival. Hemodynamically stable patients had a longer door-to-surgery time than those with hypotension (152 vs. 95.5 min, p = 0.003). Multivariable analysis showed significantly shorter door-to-surgery times for patients with hypotension (percent difference, -26.3%; 95% CI, -48.7% to -4.0%). Hemodynamically stable patients with ruptured TAA/AAA can have longer door-to-surgery times, leading to avoidable delays in successful treatment. This study underscores the need for heightened clinical vigilance among physicians, as a delay in treatment may lead to worse outcomes in these patients."

    "abstract": "A 65-year-old man presented with Stanford type B aortic dissection complicated by rupture of the distal aortic arch, originating from the false lumen. Due to the short distance between the supra-aortic branches, the lack of peripheral access from malperfusion, and the invasiveness of combined arch and descending aortic replacement via left thoracotomy, emergency total arch replacement with a frozen elephant trunk was chosen to close the primary entry and control the rupture. However, intraoperative deployment of the prosthesis into the false lumen was suspected due to increasing bleeding and transesophageal echocardiographic findings. Seamless endovascular fenestration of the dissection flap was performed intraoperatively using the tail of a stiff wire under fluoroscopic guidance. By adding stent grafts to the distal true lumen, bleeding from the ruptured aorta was successfully controlled. This case highlights the feasibility and utility of a rapid, simplified intraoperative endovascular fenestration technique in a critical emergency time setting, demonstrating a life-saving strategy when the device is inadvertently deployed into the false lumen."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) is a lethal emergency requiring prompt diagnosis. Current computed tomography angiography (CTA)-based diagnosis requires contrast agents, which expends time, whereas existing deep learning (DL) models only support single-modality inputs [non-contrast computed tomography (CT) or CTA]. In this study, we propose a bimodal DL framework to independently process both types, enabling dual-path detection and improving diagnostic efficiency. Patients who underwent non-contrast CT and CTA from February 2016 to September 2021 were retrospectively included from three institutions, including the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine (Center I), Zhejiang Hospital (Center II), and Yiwu Central Hospital (Center III). A two-stage DL model for predicting AD was developed. The first stage used an aorta detection network (AoDN) to localize the aorta in non-contrast CT or CTA images. Image patches that contained detected aorta were cut from CT images and combined to form an image patch sequence, which was inputted to an aortic dissection diagnosis network (ADDiN) to diagnose AD in the second stage. The following performances were assessed: aorta detection and diagnosis using average precision at the intersection over union threshold 0.5 (AP@0.5) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The first cohort, comprising 102 patients (53±15 years, 80 men) from two institutions, was used for the AoDN, whereas the second cohort, consisting of 861 cases (55±15 years, 623 men) from three institutions, was used for the ADDiN. For the AD task, the AoDN achieved AP@0.5 99.14% on the non-contrast CT test set and 99.34% on the CTA test set, respectively. For the AD diagnosis task, the ADDiN obtained an AUCs of 0.98 on the non-contrast CT test set and 0.99 on the CTA test set. The proposed bimodal CT data-driven DL model accurately diagnoses AD, facilitating prompt hospital diagnosis and treatment of AD."

    "abstract": "Despite standardised approaches, subjective assessment and inconsistent diagnostic testing for chest pain in the emergency department (ED) drive costs, disparities and adverse outcomes. Artificial intelligence offers potential to automate and improve risk stratification. Using a retrospective cohort of 15 048 patients presenting to the ED of a tertiary care hospital, we trained a neural network classifier ('Chest Pain-AI' or 'CP-AI') to predict a 7-day composite endpoint of major cardiovascular diagnoses including myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection and all-cause mortality. Inputs to CP-AI included age, sex, cardiac biomarkers (D-dimer or troponin I or T positivity) and numerical representations of presenting 12-lead ECGs. ECG representations were derived using a publicly available deep learning model known as patient contrastive learning of representations. In an external validation set of 14 476 patients, we evaluated CP-AI against comparator models, including a 'Biomarker Model' incorporating clinical data (age, sex, biomarker positivity), based on both the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). CP-AI outperformed the Biomarker Model in prediction of the 7-day composite endpoint with an AUROC of 0.82 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.83) vs 0.79 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.81) and an AUPRC of 0.46 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.49) vs 0.35 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.37) (p<0.05 for both comparisons). CP-AI, a fully automated neural network classifier, demonstrated superior performance in the prediction of 7-day major cardiovascular diagnoses for patients presenting with acute chest pain compared with conventional models trained on demographics and cardiac biomarkers. CP-AI may standardise and expedite risk stratification of patients presenting to the ED with chest pain."

    "abstract": "Rapid risk stratification is crucial in patients with acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD), particularly those presenting with circulatory collapse or malperfusion. This study investigated whether preoperative blood lactate levels could predict surgical outcomes. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 166 patients who underwent emergency surgery for ATAAD between 2014 and 2022. Preoperative arterial lactate levels were measured at admission. Multivariate logistic regression identified risk factors for in-hospital mortality. The optimal lactate cutoff value was determined using receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis. Correlation with the Penn classification was also assessed. In-hospital mortality was 4.2%. A lactate level ≥3.7 mmol/L was independently associated with in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio, 1.41, p = 0.026) and was strongly correlated with Penn classes Ac and Abc. Patients with elevated lactate levels had more severe clinical presentations, prolonged intensive care unit stays, and more postoperative complications. Long-term mortality was also significantly higher in the high-lactate group (p = 0.013). A preoperative lactate level ≥3.7 mmol/L is a practical and effective point-of-care predictor of surgical outcomes in ATAAD. It reflects circulatory collapse and severe malperfusion, and may assist nonspecialist clinicians in early triage and decision-making."

    "title": "Relationship of aortic outflow tract size on point-of-care ultrasound to aortic dissection diagnosis.",
    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is an uncommon diagnosis with a high mortality rate. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) can serve as an adjunct to computed tomography angiography (CTA) to diagnose aortic dissection. We aimed to determine the association of the aortic outflow tract (AOFT) diameter on POCUS with Stanford type A and type B dissections, along with determining the time to POCUS and CTA. This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of all patients presenting to an Emergency Department (ED) with over 110,000 annual visits between November 1, 2013, and November 30, 2024, found to have an aortic dissection. All ED patients ≥18 years old with an aortic dissection were included based on ICD-10 code. We also separately included 100 random patients for a normal non-dissection cohort who had received a cardiac POCUS. Patients were excluded based on chart review if their chart was unable to be located, if they had an aortic ulceration, abdominal aortic aneurysm, or thoracic aortic dilation without dissection; if they had a previously repaired aortic dissection without acute dissection; if they had a chronic dissection; duplicate visits; or an incorrectly coded visit. Chart review and POCUS image review was conducted by trained study investigators for patient demographics, diagnosis, outcomes, and AOFT diameter measured outside-to-inside. The primary study outcome was the size of AOFT on ED POCUS, while the secondary outcomes were time to CTA in patients who were not transferred with a known dissection comparing both patients who had CTA first versus POCUS first, and comparing those with and without POCUS. A total of 223 aortic dissection patients plus 100 non-dissection patients were included. There were 132 (59.2 %) type A dissections and 91 (40.8 %) type B dissections, with an overall mortality rate of 21.1 % (47 deaths). Of the 141 patients (63.2 %) with a POCUS performed, there were 98 type A dissections with an average AOFT size of 4.65 cm (median 4.65 cm; IQR 4.05-5.18 cm) and 43 type B dissections with an average AOFT size of 3.94 cm (median 3.85 cm; IQR 3.55-4.36 cm), which was a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001), and significantly greater than the normal cohort AOFT of 3.29 cm (median 3.32 cm; IQR 3.02-3.60 cm). There was no statistically significant difference in time to CTA in both patients who had CTA first versus POCUS first (p = 0.54), and comparing those with and without POCUS (p = 0.67). The average AOFT size was 4.65 cm (median 4.65 cm; IQR 4.05-5.18 cm) for type A dissections and 3.94 cm (median 3.85 cm; IQR 3.55-4.36 cm) for type B dissections, compared to 3.29 cm (median 3.32 cm; IQR 3.02-3.60 cm) in a non-dissection cohort, showing a strong association between aortic dissection and a dilated AOFT in a single center cross-sectional study. AOFT measurement alone should not be used to rule out aortic dissection. Future research should focus on improving specificity of POCUS for aortic dissection through a prospective multicentered validation of AOFT measurements."

    "title": "Delayed diagnosis of aortic dissection: the overlooked clues on chest X-ray.",
    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AD) is a life-threatening vascular emergency requiring immediate intervention, with mortality rates increasing by 1-2% per hour post-onset. The pathophysiology involves an intimal tear that permits blood to enter the medial layer, forming a false lumen that may expand and compromise branch vessels and end-organ perfusion. Current guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), American College of Cardiology (ACC), and American Heart Association (AHA) highlight the necessity of risk stratification based on clinical features (e.g., tearing pain, pulse deficits), predisposing factors (e.g., hypertension), and D-dimer levels, followed by confirmatory imaging with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) or computed tomography angiography (CTA). Despite advancements in imaging, chest radiography (CXR) remains underutilized; however, key findings-such as mediastinal widening (≥ 5 cm at the aortic knob), abnormal aortic contour, and displaced intimal calcifications-can offer critical diagnostic information. A young male patient presented with acute chest pain following strenuous exertion. Initial outpatient evaluation, including complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests (LFTs), renal function tests (RFTs), cardiac enzymes, and chest X-ray (CXR), yielded nondiagnostic results, leading to his discharge with analgesics. Three days later, during a national holiday when outpatient clinics were closed, the patient returned to the emergency department (ED) with persistent chest pain. A meticulous review of the initial CXR by the emergency physician revealed mediastinal widening (measuring 8.5 cm) and an abnormal contour of the aorta. Subsequent emergency computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed the diagnosis of a Stanford type B aortic dissection. This case underscores two critical learning points: (1) the diagnostic pitfalls associated with atypical early presentations of aortic dissection, and (2) the often underappreciated value of meticulous interpretation of chest X-rays in the evaluation of acute chest pain, particularly when initial studies yield unremarkable results. The three-day diagnostic delay emphasizes the necessity of maintaining a high index of suspicion for aortic dissection, even in young patients lacking classic risk factors."

    "abstract": "Constrictive pericarditis, often resulting from pericardial adhesions secondary to chest radiotherapy or cardiac surgery, generally carries a favorable prognosis when surgical intervention is performed early. In contrast, extensive acute aortic dissection is associated with a significantly higher mortality rate, highlighting the critical importance of timely surgical intervention to improve patient outcomes. Here, we present a case involving a patient with a ruptured Stanford type A aortic dissection complicated by constrictive pericarditis, which led to the formation of a large pseudoaneurysm causing severe compression of the right atrium and markedly increasing the risk of mortality. The patient underwent successful emergency one-stage surgery and was discharged with a favorable recovery. This report uniquely highlights the management of two life-threatening conditions-type A aortic dissection and constrictive pericarditis-in a single surgical procedure, aiming to enhance patient survival and minimize complications. This case not only illustrates a successful life-saving intervention but also provides a strategic framework for cardiac surgeons, encouraging them to address complex, high-risk cases with an integrated approach."

Patients were categorized into two time periods: before (Period A: 2019-2020) and after (Period B: 2021-2023) the introduction of the emergency EVAR service. Outcomes assessed included 30-day and one-year mortality, length of hospital stay, complication rates, and return-to-theatre rates. Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) calculations based on Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs).ResultsA total of 71 patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm were identified, of whom 58 underwent surgical repair (OSR or EVAR). In Period A, all patients (n = 17) underwent open surgical repair. In Period B, 24 received OSR (58.5%) and 17 received EVAR (41.5%). The 30-day mortality rate was significantly lower in the EVAR group (5.9%) compared to OSR in both periods (63.3% and 50%, respectively; P = .001). The one-year mortality rate remained unchanged for EVAR but increased for OSR (P = .00075). Return-to-theatre rates were significantly higher in OSR patients (P = .044). ICER calculations showed EVAR to be cost-effective (-£202 526 per QALY within one year).ConclusionThe introduction of a surgeon-led emergency EVAR service significantly improved early survival rates and reduced reintervention rates in rAAA patients while demonstrating cost-effectiveness compared to OSR."

This study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of a novel G-branch off-the-shelf endograft for TAAA. A total of 73 patients with TAAA were treated using the G-branch endograft at 14 sites across China. The primary endpoints were the 30-day technical success and major adverse events rates. The secondary endpoints were all-cause mortality, secondary intervention, endoleaks, target vessel patency, and freedom from renal function deterioration during a 1-year follow-up. The technical success rate was 95.9% (70/73). Renovisceral artery reconstruction was successful in 99.7% (291/292) of patients. Within 30 days, six patients (8.2%) experienced major adverse events, namely paraplegia (n = 2), acute kidney injury (n = 2), acute myocardial infarction (n = 1), and cerebral infarction (n = 1). During the 1-year follow-up, one patient died from aortic dissection, giving an overall survival rate of 98.6%. Four patients (5.5%) underwent secondary interventions, giving a freedom from secondary intervention rate of 92.8%. Endoleaks occurred in 12 patients (10 type II, 2 type III). The primary patency rate of the target vessels was 95.7%, and three bridged stent grafts were successfully recanalized, resulting in a secondary patency rate of 96.7%. Renal function deterioration occurred in six patients (8.2%), giving a freedom from renal function deterioration rate of 94.6%. The off-the-shelf G-Branch endograft appears safe, with favorable 30-day and 1-year mortality and morbidity rates for both elective and urgent TAAA treatment."

    "abstract": "Type A aortic dissection (TAAD) complicated by cardiac tamponade represents a life-threatening cardiovascular emergency. Acute pericardial effusion can severely compromise cardiac function. Although emergent surgical repair remains the gold standard, preoperative hemodynamic instability substantially increases surgical risk. Controlled pericardial drainage (CPD) has been proposed as a bridging intervention to rapidly relieve tamponade symptoms while mitigating the complications associated with excessive drainage. However, its clinical utility remains controversial because of concerns that the elevation in post-drainage blood pressure may accelerate dissection progression or trigger rupture. This case report highlights the successful use of CPD to stabilize a patient with TAAD and cardiac tamponade, facilitating a safe transition to definitive surgery. It also discusses the clinical utility of this strategy. A 48-year-old man presented to the emergency department with an acute onset of altered mental status lasting 50 min. Bedside ultrasound and aortic computed tomography angiography confirmed a TAAD diagnosis complicated by pericardial tamponade. After the examination, the patient experienced sudden hypotension, which was promptly managed with emergency CPD, resulting in rapid stabilization of blood pressure. Subsequently, the patient underwent \"Sun's procedure\" and artificial vascular replacement, during which 500 mL of pericardial blood was extracted. The patient recovered well and was discharged 24 days after the surgery. With rigorous hemodynamic monitoring and a multidisciplinary framework, CPD effectively functions as a preoperative stabilization approach in patients with TAAD complicated by pericardial tamponade, securing valuable time for subsequent surgical interventions."

    "title": "Aortic dissection in the ED: a medico-legal perspective on diagnostic delays and failures.",
    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is a life-threatening emergency and delayed or missed diagnoses can result in significant morbidity and mortality for patients. We conducted a quantitative and qualitative analysis of medico-legal cases from a national repository involving thoracic aortic dissection seen in the emergency department during a 10-year period. We thematically analyzed peer expert criticism of the care in these cases, including provider, team, and systems factors related to diagnostic issues. We also applied two clinical decision tools to explore whether use of these tools could have affected the diagnostic process. Of 3,531 medico-legal cases in the emergency department during our study period, just 43 were related to aortic dissection. Patients were primarily male (68.2%), presented for care at large urban centers (65.1%), and were triaged as urgent or emergent (72.1%). Thirty-six patients died of their aortic dissection. A thematic analysis identified atypical presentations, diagnostic anchoring, misinterpretation or misuse of tests, communication breakdowns, and resource limitations as common in these cases. Missed diagnoses of aortic dissection in the ED often result from a combination of cognitive, communication, and system-level factors. Understanding these contributors can inform evidence-based, systems-level supports and strategies to enhance diagnostic accuracy and reduce patient harm. RéSUMé: OBJECTIF: La dissection aortique est une situation d’urgence potentiellement mortelle qui, en cas de retard ou d’erreur de diagnostic, risque de se traduire par une morbidité et une mortalité considérables. MéTHODES: Nous avons tiré d’une base de données nationale les dossiers médicolégaux mettant en cause une dissection de l’aorte thoracique à l’urgence sur une période de 10 ans et en avons fait une analyse quantitative et qualitative. Nous avons également analysé les thèmes sur lesquels portaient les critiques formulées par l’expertise médicale à l’égard des soins prodigués dans ces dossiers, y compris les facteurs liés aux médecins, à l’équipe et au système qui ont contribué aux problèmes de diagnostic. Enfin, nous avons eu recours à deux outils d’aide à la décision clinique pour déterminer si leur utilisation aurait eu une incidence sur le processus diagnostique. RéSULTATS: Sur les 3 531 dossiers médico-légaux mettant en cause un incident survenu à l’urgence au cours de la période de l’étude, seuls 43 étaient liés à une dissection aortique. En majorité, les patient·es étaient de sexe masculin (68,2 %) et s’étaient présenté·es pour obtenir des soins dans un grand centre urbain (65,1 %). Pour la plupart, leur cas avait été jugé urgent ou extrêmement urgent au triage (72,1 %). Trente-six patient·es sont décédé·es de leur dissection aortique. Notre analyse des critiques formulées par l’expertise médicale a permis de dégager certains thèmes récurrents dans ces dossiers : tableau atypique, biais d’ancrage, mauvaise interprétation de résultats d’examen ou prescription d’examens inappropriés, problèmes de communication et ressources limitées. CONCLUSIONS: Les erreurs de diagnostic en présence d’une dissection aortique à l’urgence découlent souvent d’une combinaison de facteurs cognitifs, communicationnels et systémiques. La compréhension de ces facteurs contributifs pourrait éclairer l’adoption de mesures de soutien et de stratégies systémiques fondées sur des données probantes pour accroître la précision du diagnostic et réduire les préjudices aux patient·es."

A single-institution retrospective review of consecutive patients who underwent zone 2 aortic repair with TBE between 2022 and 2024 was performed. Treatment indications included acute complicated aortic dissection, aortic dissection with aneurysmal degeneration, penetrating aortic ulcer, blunt thoracic aortic injury, and de novo aneurysmal disease. Sixty-three consecutive patients (66.7% male; mean age, 61.0 ± 16.5 years) underwent zone 2 repair with a TBE device, 29 (46.0%) for aneurysmal disease, 15 (23.8%) for blunt thoracic aortic injury, 17 (27.0%) for dissection, and 2 (3.2%) for penetrating aortic ulcer. Twenty-one (33.3%) were urgent or emergent cases performed within 24 hours of presentation. Side branch treatment was performed through percutaneous left radial access in 60 patients (95.2%). Radial access was technically successful in 100% of attempts without the need for more proximal percutaneous or open upper extremity access. One (1.7%) asymptomatic radial artery occlusion was detected postoperatively, and did not require intervention. Postoperative imaging was obtained before discharge in 58 patients (92.1%), demonstrating 100% subclavian side branch patency. These results demonstrate that left radial access is safe and effective for subclavian branch treatment during thoracic branch endoprosthesis for management of zone 2 aortic pathology."

    "abstract": "Type B iatrogenic acute aortic dissection (IAAD) is a rare complication of diagnostic or interventional cardiac procedures. The STent Assisted Balloon Induced intimaL dISruption and rElamination in aortic dissection repair (STABILISE) technique is being increasingly used for the treatment of complicated aortic dissections. However, hemodynamic changes and the pre-existence of aneurysmal arteries could lead to \"unexpected\" complications. This case report shows how rescue techniques can be employed in response to such challenging handling situations, especially in emergency settings. We describe the case of a patient with bilateral common iliac artery (CIA) aneurysm subjected to coronary angiography followed by iatrogenic type B acute aortic dissection (TBAAD), treated with the STABILISE technique, further complicated with left iliac aneurysm rupture on the 9th postoperative day. During aortic bifurcated endograft deployment, the contralateral gate opened into the false lumen (FL), and it was impossible to re-enter the true lumen (TL). As a rescue solution, an iliac extension was deployed parallel to the main body, using the sandwich technique, extending to the external iliac artery. Before deployment, the left hypogastric artery was embolized with coils. Despite the false lumen of the right iliac aneurysm being perfused by the patent contralateral leg, the ruptured aneurysm was excluded. At a later stage, the right hypogastric artery was embolized with several coils, and the gate was embolized using an Amplatzer™ Vascular Plug. In complex cases, especially with dissections, the unexpected is around the corner. The use of off-the-shelf devices, knowledge of rescue techniques as Parallel Graft Technique (PGT) and experience in applying them can resolve situations that might otherwise be disastrous."

    "title": "Impact of the frozen elephant trunk technique in operation for acute type A aortic dissection: from the Japan cardiovascular surgery database.",
    "abstract": "We compared early outcomes of total arch repair (TAR) and ascending aorta replacement (AAR) for acute aortic dissection type A (AADA) using the nationwide Japan Cardiovascular Surgery Database (JCVSD) and examined the role of the frozen elephant trunk (FET) technique in TAR. Of 17,075 JCVSD patients undergoing urgent or emergent conventional surgery for AADA in 2013-2016, redo cases and those undergoing valve/root or coronary surgery were excluded (included n = 12,288). Four propensity score-matched analyses for treatment with AAR or TAR (n = 4272 each) were established. After matching, procedure times were significantly longer and incidences of re-exploration for bleeding (5.9 vs. 3.9%, P < 0.0001) or spinal cord injury (4.8 vs. 3.3%, P = 0.0003) were significantly higher in the TAR group than AAR group. In-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher in the TAR group than AAR group (9.5 vs. 7.0%, P < 0.0001). When FET was used, the incidences of some of morbidities improved and the difference in in-hospital mortality between TAR and AAR groups disappeared (8.3 vs. 7.7%, P = 0.6583). However, the incidence of re-exploration for bleeding was still high (5.7 vs. 3.0%, P = 0.0066) and the incidence of spinal cord injury became pronounced (6.7 vs. 2.9%, P = 0.0002). TAR was associated with longer procedure time and higher incidences of postoperative morbidities and mortality. FET holds promise for improving outcomes of TAR. However, spinal cord injury has emerged as another serious concern and its clinical role remains unclear."

    "title": "[Incidence and risk factors of acute kidney injury after aortic dissection surgery].",
    "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the incidence and risk factors of acute kidney injury (AKI) after aortic dissection surgery. Methods: The data of patients who underwent aortic dissection surgery in the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery of Jiangsu Provincial People's Hospital from January 2020 to June 2024 were retrospectively collected. The primary endpoint was the incidence of AKI within 7 days postoperatively, and the secondary endpoint was the occurrence of AKI combined with dialysis (AKI-D). Logistic regression was used to analyze the influencing factors of AKI and AKI-D. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method was employed to interpret the results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis and quantify the contribution of each factor. Results: A total of 850 patients aged [M (Q1, Q3)] 56 (48, 66) years were included, with 679 males (79.9%) and 171 females (20.1%). The study identified 490 cases (57.6%) with Stanford type A aortic dissection and 360 cases (42.4%) with type B. The incidence of AKI within 7 days postoperatively was 40.1% (341/850), with the incidence of AKI in type A dissection significantly higher than that in type B dissection [60.8% (298/490) vs 11.9% (43/360), P<0.001]. AKI-D occurred in 19.5% (166/850) of patients, and the in-hospital mortality rate was 8.8% (75/850). The independent risk factors for postoperative AKI, ranked by contribution, were emergency surgery (OR=2.38, 95%CI: 1.39-4.06; SHAP=0.085), surgery duration (per 1-hour increase, OR=1.18, 95%CI: 1.09-1.29; SHAP=0.084), Stanford type A (OR=2.04, 95%CI: 1.09-3.81; SHAP=0.062), baseline serum creatinine (per 10 μmol/L increase, OR=1.12, 95%CI: 1.06-1.18; SHAP=0.058), intraoperative erythrocyte transfusion (for each additional U, OR=1.09, 95%CI: 1.02-1.15; SHAP=0.037), D-dimer (per 1 mg/L increase, OR=1.03, 95%CI: 1.01-1.06; SHAP=0.036). The independent risk factors for AKI-D, ranked by contribution, were surgical duration (per 1-hour increase, OR=1.31, 95%CI: 1.19-1.45; SHAP=0.083), baseline serum creatinine (per 10 μmol/L increase, OR=1.16, 95%CI: 1.09-1.24; SHAP=0.053), emergency surgery (OR=2.60, 95%CI: 1.34-5.01; SHAP=0.045), female gender (OR=2.73,95%CI: 1.57-4.76; SHAP=0.040), D-dimer (per 1 mg/L increase, OR=1.05, 95%CI: 1.02-1.07; SHAP=0.033), poor renal perfusion classification (missing, OR=2.34, 95%CI: 1.34-4.09; SHAP=0.032), intraoperative erythrocyte transfusion (per 1 U increase, OR=1.07, 95%CI: 1.01-1.14; SHAP=0.021). Conclusions: The incidence of AKI after aortic dissection surgery is high, particularly in patients with type A dissection. Prolonged operation time and elevated preoperative serum creatinine are common risk factors for both AKI and AKI-D. 目的： 探讨主动脉夹层术后急性肾损伤（AKI）的发生率及其危险因素。 方法： 回顾性收集江苏省人民医院心脏大血管外科2020年1月至2024年6月行主动脉夹层手术的患者资料。主要研究终点为术后7 d内发生AKI，次要终点为AKI合并透析（AKI-D）发生。采用logistic回归分析AKI、AKI-D的危险因素，利用Shapley可加性特征解释（SHAP）方法对多因素logistic回归分析的结果进行解释，量化各因素的贡献度。 结果： 最终纳入850例患者，男679例（79.9%），女171例（20.1%），年龄［M（Q1，Q3）］56（48，66）岁。其中Stanford A型、B型主动脉夹层分别为490例（57.6%）和360例（42.4%）。术后7 d内AKI发生率为40.1%（341/850），其中A型夹层AKI发生率高于B型夹层［60.8%（298/490）比11.9%（43/360），P<0.001］。19.5%（166/850）的患者术后需要透析，8.8%（75/850）的患者住院期间死亡。术后AKI的危险因素按贡献度依次为急诊手术（OR=2.38，95%CI：1.39~4.06；SHAP=0.085）、手术时间（每增加1 h，OR=1.18，95%CI：1.09~1.29；SHAP=0.084）、Stanford A型（OR=2.04，95%CI：1.09~3.81；SHAP=0.062）、基线血肌酐（每增加10 μmol/L，OR=1.12，95%CI：1.06~1.18；SHAP=0.058）、术中输红细胞（每增加1 U，OR=1.09，95%CI：1.02~1.15；SHAP=0.037）、D-二聚体（每增加1 mg/L，OR=1.03，95%CI：1.01~1.06；SHAP=0.036）。AKI-D的危险因素按贡献度依次为手术时间（每增加1 h，OR=1.31，95%CI：1.19~1.45；SHAP=0.083）、基线血肌酐（每增加10 μmol/L，OR=1.16，95%CI：1.09~1.24；SHAP=0.053）、急诊手术（OR=2.60，95%CI：1.34~5.01；SHAP=0.045）、女性（OR=2.73，95%CI：1.57~4.76；SHAP=0.040）、D-二聚体（每增加1 mg/L，OR=1.05，95%CI：1.02~1.07；SHAP=0.033）、肾脏灌注不良（缺失，OR=2.34，95%CI：1.34~4.09；SHAP=0.032）、术中输红细胞（每增加1 U，OR=1.07，95%CI：1.01~1.14；SHAP=0.021）。 结论： 主动脉夹层术后AKI发生率高，尤其是A型夹层患者。急诊手术、手术时间长、术前血肌酐高是AKI和AKI-D的主要危险因素。."

    "abstract": "A 47-year-old female with dyspnoea, poor blood pressure control and a family history of aortic disease presented with chronic type IA aortic dissection (with a maximal aortic diameter of 50 mm at the ascending aorta level). Anatomically, the patient presented with involvement of the brachiocephalic trunk and the left renal artery originated from the false lumen. The aortic valve was trileaflet but demonstrated severe eccentric insufficiency. Due to this constellation of findings, urgent surgical repair was indicated. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established centrally by direct true lumen cannulation with Seldinger echo-guided technique and cross-clamping between the distal ascending aorta and the proximal aortic arch (zone 0) performed while cooling. A period of high-moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest (26°C core temperature) with bilateral selective antegrade cerebral perfusion was utilized to complete the distal reconstruction. To repair the morphologically normal trileaflet but severely regurgitant aortic valve prolapsing in the dissected aortic root a valve-sparing aortic root replacement (David procedure) was performed."

    "abstract": "Blunt traumatic thoracic aortic injury (BTAI) is considered a life-threatening surgical emergency. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has significantly improved survival rates and reduced complications. The patients are typically young and present with normal aortic diameter. Often, there is a discrepancy in diameter between commercially available \"off-the-shelf\" thoracic aortic endografts and the diameter of the aorta. We performed a retrospective study examining short-term outcomes of TEVAR oversizing for BTAI patients at our institution from 2004 to 2024. The primary outcome was procedural success, while secondary outcomes included endoleak, graft occlusion, and reintervention. A total of thirty-three cases involving BTAI were managed by TEVAR, with a mean age of 48.9±19.4 years. The injury severity score averaged 29.1±9.6 points. Most cases were grade 3 BTAI, accounting for 87.9%. The mean aortic diameter at the proximal landing zone was 24.4±3.6 mm, and the distal zone was 22.5±4.0 mm. Proximal stent oversizing was 31.9±4.1%, and the distal was 28.5±4.1%. All cases achieved procedural success. One case involved an early retrograde aortic dissection that required subsequent proximal extension, while another case presented an endoleak originating from the left subclavian branch, necessitating subclavian embolization and a bypass from the left carotid to the subclavian artery. No graft occlusions were reported. The oversized TEVAR procedure may be performed under emergency conditions of BTAI, providing life-saving benefits with acceptable early outcomes."

    "abstract": "Hemostasis at the aortic root during replacement surgery for acute Stanford type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) can be technically challenging due to tissue fragility, often leading to fatal bleeding. We adopted a double-felt pledget technique to improve hemostasis. This study aimed to evaluate the surgical outcomes of this technique. We retrospectively reviewed 231 emergency ATAAD surgeries performed at our hospital between January 2010 and August 2022. Of these, 24 patients underwent aortic root replacement using the double-felt pledget technique. Primary outcomes included postoperative bleeding, need for rethoracotomy, and in-hospital mortality. Long-term survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Among 24 patients (14 men, mean age 60 years), no in-hospital or 30-day mortality occurred. No patients required reoperation for bleeding. The average hospital stay was 28 days. During a mean follow-up of 3.7 years, only 1 patient died of an unknown cause, and 3 required further aortic interventions. The technique was particularly effective in reoperative cases and those with connective tissue disorders. The double-felt pledget technique achieved favorable hemostasis and surgical outcomes in aortic root replacement for ATAAD. This technique may contribute to improving operative safety in high-risk aortic root procedures."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (AAAD) is a critical cause of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). While non-contrast computed tomography (CT) has recently been reported as effective for diagnosing AAAD in OHCA patients, the proportion of OHCA cases due to AAAD and their clinical characteristics remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate these factors in patients transported to our hospital. This single-center retrospective study included 985 non-traumatic adult OHCA patients who underwent non-contrast CT between June 2017 and December 2022. Patients were categorized into three groups: cardiac causes (Group-C), non-cardiac causes without AAAD (Group-NC), and AAAD (Group-AAAD). Clinical characteristics and CT findings were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression identified predictors of AAAD-related OHCA. Among 985 patients, 763 (77 %) were in Group-C, 136 (14 %) in Group-NC, and 86 (8 %) in Group-AAAD. The prevalence of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was significantly lower in Group-AAAD than in Group-C and Group-NC (8 % vs. 27 % vs. 33 %, p < 0.001). Female sex (OR 4.21, p < 0.001), witnessed arrest (OR 2.06, p = 0.003), non-shockable rhythm (OR 3.06, p = 0.042), and absence of ROSC (OR 4.95, p < 0.001) were independent predictors of AAAD-related OHCA. AAAD should be considered in OHCA patients, especially females with witnessed arrest, non-shockable rhythms, and no ROSC. Recognizing these factors may aid in early diagnosis and improve clinical decision-making in emergency settings."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to analyse how different indications for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) impact early mortality and long-term outcomes in patients with acute type A aortic dissection at a single high-volume centre. Between 2010 and 2018, patients diagnosed with acute type A aortic dissection who underwent emergency surgical repair at Fuwai Hospital were included. Patients were categorized by presence of concomitant CABG. Within this group, patients were further stratified by indication: coronary artery dissection, coronary artery disease (CAD), and heart failure after declamping (HFD). A total of 972 patients (mean age 47 years) were included. The 30-day mortality was significantly higher in the CABG group [18/119 (15.1%) vs 48/853 (5.6%); P < .001], with rates of 8.1% (5/62) for coronary artery dissection, 5.7% (2/35) for CAD, and 50% (11/22) for HFD. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that bypass grafting for HFD increased 30-day mortality (odds ratio, 3.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-14.22). Overall, 10-year survival was 82.0%. Landmark analysis revealed that HFD patients had non-inferior late survival compared to other subgroups, whereas patients with CAD exhibited the lowest late survival rate (P = .002). CABG for HFD significantly increases the risk of 30-day mortality but not long-term mortality. Bypass grafting for CAD does not affect 30-day mortality but decreases long-term survival beyond this period compared to patients without bypass grafting."

    "abstract": "Midgut volvulus is an uncommon but critical complication arising from congenital intestinal malrotation. The condition typically presents during infancy, and adult-onset cases, particularly in elderly patients, are rare and often pose a diagnostic challenge due to their nonspecific and variable clinical presentation. We report the case of a mid-hexagenerian female with a known history of hypertension, aortic dissection with coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease, who presented with acute-onset colicky abdominal pain, bilious vomiting, and obstipation. Imaging revealed a 180-degree clockwise twisting of the distal ileal loop and the characteristic \"whirlpool sign,\" indicative of volvulus. Emergency exploratory laparotomy confirmed midgut volvulus secondary to malrotation with Ladd's bands and an incidental finding of uninflamed broad-based jejunal diverticula. A Ladd's procedure was successfully performed to release adhesions and bands between the bowel and mesentery. Postoperative ileus complicated the patient's recovery but was resolved with conservative management. In elderly adults, midgut volvulus secondary to intestinal malrotation should be considered in unexplained cases of intestinal obstruction. Progression to bowel ischemia can be prevented by early radiological evaluation and timely surgical management. Jejunal diverticulosis coexistence can be challenging when it is inflamed and perforated; however, in our case, it was a silent spectator not involved in the cause of volvulus."

    "abstract": "During emergency surgery, patients with acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) experience unfavourable outcomes throughout their hospital stay. The combination of total aortic arch replacement (TAR) and frozen elephant trunk (FET) implantation has become a dependable choice for surgical treatment. The objective of this research was to utilize a machine learning technique based on artificial intelligence to detect the factors that increase the risk of mortality within 30 days after surgery in patients who undergo TAR in combination with FET. From January 2015 to December 2020, a total of 640 patients with ATAAD who underwent TAR and FET were included in this study. The subjects were divided into a test group and a validation group in a random manner, with a ratio of 7 to 3. The objective of our research was to create predictive models by employing different supervised machine learning techniques, such as XGBoost, logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), to assess and compare their respective performances. Furthermore, we employed SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) measures to allocate interpretive attributional values. Among all the patients, 37 (5.78%) experienced perioperative mortality. Subsequently, a total 50 of 10 highly associated variables were selected for model construction. By implementing the new method, the AUC value significantly improved from 0.6981 using the XGBoost model to 0.8687 with the PSO-ELM-FLXGBoost model. In this study, machine learning methods were successfully established to predict ATAAD perioperative mortality, enabling the optimization of postoperative treatment strategies to minimize the postoperative complications following cardiac surgeries."

A retrospective observational analysis was conducted on 750 adult patients who underwent emergency surgery for ATAAD between January 2017 and December 2019. The overall in-hospital mortality was 5.7%. Among 750 patients, 91 patients(12.1%) developed PPCs. Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that smoking(OR = 2.212, 95%CI: 1.361-3.595, P = 0.001), previous cardiac surgery(OR = 2.818, 95%CI: 1.259-6.310, P = 0.012), CPB time(OR = 1.003, 95%CI: 1.000-1.006, P = 0.047), and red blood cell transfusion(OR = 1.091, 95%CI: 1.059-1.124, P < 0.001) were associated with an increased risk of developing PPCs. Patients who developed PPCs had a higher 30-day mortality rate (P < 0.001), longer lengths of stay in the ICU and hospital(P < 0.001), increased healthcare costs(P < 0.001), and lower long-term survival rates(P = 0.005). The incidence of PPCs is high in patients undergoing cardiac surgery for aortic dissection, adversely affecting their prognosis.

    "abstract": "Brain computed tomography (CT) perfusion imaging is essential for determining patient eligibility for mechanical thrombectomy in wake-up stroke cases. CT scanning is also valuable for enabling simultaneous whole-body imaging, which supports access route evaluation and helps exclude differential diagnoses such as aortic dissection. In this report, we describe comprehensive brain perfusion CT and whole-body imaging for diagnostic evaluation in a 91-year-old female patient who presented to the emergency department with a suspected wake-up stroke. The use of the split-bolus contrast injection method, combined with a low tube voltage, enabled a simplified protocol that used a minimal contrast medium dose, achieving CT attenuation values of ≥400 Hounsfield units throughout the major thoracoabdominal vessels. This enhanced vascular visualization supported a prompt and accurate diagnosis. We identified an exceptionally rare case of multiple simultaneous thromboembolisms, including cerebral infarction due to brachiocephalic artery occlusion, pulmonary thromboembolism, left atrial thrombus, and myocardial infarction. All diagnoses were made in a single imaging session. Although rare, concurrent aortic dissection and myocardial infarction have been reported in patients with acute ischemic stroke, underscoring the clinical importance of comprehensive diagnostic evaluation. This case illustrates the utility of integrated brain perfusion and whole-body CT scanning in identifying multi-site thromboembolisms."

    "title": "Aorto-Right Atrial Fistula Caused by Subacute Type A Aortic Dissection Six Months After Double Valve Replacement: A Case Report and Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "Type A aortic dissection (TAAD) in Stanford classification after previous cardiac surgery is a rare but serious complication, with an incidence of 0.1%-0.2%. Previous sites of cannulation, cross-clamping, and anastomosis of vein grafts have been reported as potential entry points for aortic dissection. In some cases, the aortic dissection ruptures into a neighboring atrial chamber due to dense postoperative adhesions. In this report, we present a rare case of TAAD with an aorto-right atrial fistula after double valve replacement (DVR) and provide a literature review. A 76-year-old Japanese man presented with exertional dyspnea due to severe aortic regurgitation, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Preoperative plain computed tomography (CT) revealed ascending aorta and sinus of Valsalva diameters of 45 mm each. DVR and left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion were performed. He was uneventfully discharged on postoperative day (POD) 21. Six months after the discharge, the patient complained of chest and back pain, orthopnea, and appetite loss. A family doctor firstly diagnosed him with muscle pain and belatedly realized that he suffered from acute heart failure and possible TAAD, leading to his referral to our hospital. Contrast-enhanced CT and echocardiography revealed an aorto-right atrial fistula caused by a subacute TAAD. Despite medical management, heart failure could not be controlled, necessitating emergency surgery. During the operation, the entry point of the TAAD was identified as a healthy aortic wall located just behind the previous aortotomy. An 8-mm fistula into the right atrium was observed from the false lumen. The fistula was closed with two 4-0 polypropylene felted mattress sutures only from the false lumen side and the ascending aorta was replaced with J-graft. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging revealed a left pontine infarction, but all other postoperative examinations were unremarkable. The patient was transferred to another hospital on POD 43. Six months after the TAAD operation, he underwent 1-debranching thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for residual descending aortic dissection. He has been alive for five years since the TEVAR. Successful closure of the fistula and replacement of the ascending aorta were achieved in a patient with aorto-right atrial fistula caused by subacute TAAD after DVR and LAA occlusion. When preoperative imaging shows an ascending-aorta diameter ≥45 mm, it may be reasonable to discuss the concomitant replacement of aortic root, ascending aorta and partial /hemi arch, and the cannulation strategies, in line with American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Class IIa guidance. Given the paucity of AAF cases after valve surgery, further multicenter series or registry data are needed to validate the optimal diameter threshold and cannulation approaches for preventing postoperative dissection."

    "title": "The role of the modified Glasgow prognostic score in predicting postoperative mortality following open-heart surgery.",
    "abstract": "The Modified Glasgow Prognostic Score is an inflammation-based index utilizing C-reactive protein and albumin levels. It has been investigated in various diseases such as cancer, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Open heart surgery, particularly with cardiopulmonary bypass, induces an acute-phase inflammatory response that is associated with postoperative complications and mortality. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of preoperative and early postoperative Modified Glasgow Prognostic Score in predicting early outcomes in patients undergoing open heart surgery, with the goal of improving patient stratification and surgical decision-making. A retrospective review of medical records was conducted for 456 patients who underwent open heart surgery between January 1, 2022, and October 1, 2024. All procedures were elective cases. Patients undergoing emergency operations, including those with acute type A aortic dissection, were excluded from the study. Data were collected on demographics, laboratory results, procedure duration, ejection fraction, and presence of multi-vessel disease. All patients included in the study underwent open heart surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Patients who underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) or other procedures not requiring CPB were excluded. Both preoperative and postoperative Modified Glasgow Prognostic Score were analyzed to assess their association with early postoperative outcomes. Preoperative mGPS was found to be significantly associated with early mortality (p < 0.05). A one-unit increase in Modified Glasgow Prognostic Score was associated with a 2.85-fold increase in mortality risk (95% CI: 1.85–4.41). However, no significant relationship was observed between postoperative Modified Glasgow Prognostic Score and mortality (p > 0.05). Preoperative Modified Glasgow Prognostic Score serves as a valuable prognostic marker for early mortality in open heart surgery patients. It provides independent predictive value and can enhance preoperative risk assessment, ultimately improving patient outcomes and guiding surgical management. • a. What is known about the topic? The modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) is widely recognized as an inflammation-based prognostic scoring system, primarily used in cancer patients. It combines CRP and serum albumin levels to predict clinical outcomes, particularly in assessing systemic inflammation and its role in disease prognosis. Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB) used during open-heart surgeries is known to trigger a systemic inflammatory response, which can lead to postoperative complications and increased mortality. While mGPS has been validated in various settings, its utility in predicting postoperative mortality in cardiac surgery patients, especially those undergoing CPB, has not been extensively studied. • b. What does this study add? This study provides evidence that preoperative mGPS is significantly associated with early mortality in adult patients undergoing open-heart surgery with CPB. It suggests that mGPS can serve as a valuable preoperative screening tool for identifying patients at higher risk of mortality. Additionally, this study highlights mGPS as an independent predictor of poor clinical outcomes in the short term, emphasizing its potential role in risk assessment and the management of postoperative complications in cardiac surgery. The findings underscore the need for larger, multi-center studies to validate mGPS as a practical tool in the clinical management of cardiac surgery patients."

    "abstract": "Perioperative cardiac arrest is more prevalent in emergency surgery and carries substantial mortality risks; however, large-scale studies examining its incidence, aetiology, and outcomes remain scarce. This study investigated the epidemiology of perioperative cardiac arrest in emergency and elective surgeries in Japan. We conducted a multicentre retrospective cohort study using the Japanese Intensive care PAtient Database (JIPAD), a nationwide ICU registry. Patients coming from the operating theatre who experienced cardiac arrest before ICU admission between April 2015 and March 2023 were included. Patients were categorised as undergoing emergency or elective surgery, and group comparisons were performed for the incidence, surgical procedures, aetiologies, and clinical outcomes. Perioperative cardiac arrest occurred in 874/214 303 (0.41%) surgical ICU admissions, including 563/32 408 (1.74%) of emergency surgeries and 311/181 895 (0.17%) of elective surgeries. In emergency surgeries, the most frequent surgical procedure was acute aortic dissection repair (n=90, 16.0%), whereas the most common procedure in elective surgeries was gastrointestinal neoplasm resection (n=39, 12.5%). Acute aortic syndrome was the leading aetiology in emergency surgery (n=176, 31.3%), whereas valvular heart disease (n=48, 15.4%) and acute coronary syndrome (n=42, 13.5%) were the leading aetiologies in elective surgery. Both in-hospital mortality (46.2% vs 15.8%) and transfers to other healthcare facilities (28.8% vs 14.8%) were significantly higher in emergency surgeries. This nationwide study reveals significant differences in the incidence, surgical procedures, aetiologies, and clinical outcomes of perioperative cardiac arrest between emergency and elective surgery."

We detail the implementation of progressive ExT in a 56-year-old man former recreational triathlete 16 months after emergency repair of a type I AD, who had a residual descending aortic dissection. A home-based individualized ExT plan incorporated low- to moderate-intensity aerobic and resistance exercise with progression to interval training. Exercise is often limited or withheld in patients with previous AD because of concern that sudden blood pressure elevation may increase the risk of recurrent dissection or propagation of existing dissection. Patients, once medically optimized, need proper education to safely self-monitor and adhere to ExT. This case illustrates the potential feasibility, benefit, and safety of exercise after AD, and demonstrates the need to establish evidence-based guidelines."

    "abstract": "We present the case of a 62-year-old woman with a history of long-standing, poorly controlled arterial hypertension, with average home blood pressure readings of approximately 140-160/100-110 mmHg despite treatment with ramipril, who was urgently admitted due to acute critical ischemia of the left lower limb. Imaging revealed an extensive Stanford type B aortic dissection (TBAD) involving the thoracoabdominal aorta and iliac arteries, with significantly impaired perfusion of the left leg. Due to the severity of limb ischemia and limitations to immediate endovascular repair, an urgent right-to-left femoro-femoral bypass was performed as a limb-saving procedure. Postoperatively, the patient developed multiorgan complications, including acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring hemodialysis and bowel ischemia, which were managed conservatively. The definitive repair of the dissection was achieved through thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). Several weeks later, the patient presented with a gradually enlarging, painless, pulsatile mass in the right antecubital fossa, corresponding to a prior arterial access site. Clinical features, including a palpable thrill and audible bruit, were consistent with an iatrogenic arteriovenous fistula (AVF), which was surgically excised with the preservation of arterial flow and uneventful recovery. This case underscores the complex and life-threatening course of complicated type B aortic dissection with peripheral malperfusion, the necessity of staged hybrid management, and the importance of long-term follow-up for detecting delayed iatrogenic complications associated with endovascular procedures."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) represents a life-threatening surgical emergency. Use of antiplatelet drugs and platelet dysfunction exacerbate the already high rates of postoperative morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between preoperative platelet function evaluated through Multiplate® aggregometry and transfusion requirement. This observational retrospective study included 180 patients who underwent emergency surgical repair of ATAAD over a two-year period (2019-2021). Platelet function was evaluated preoperatively using Multiplate® analyzer with three activators: adenosine diphosphate (ADP test), arachidonic acid (ASPI test) and thrombin receptor-activating peptide-6 (TRAP test). Primary outcome was the number of blood products transfused. In addition, the need for surgical re-exploration, length of hospital stay and 30-day mortality were compared. Abnormal aggregation responses were observed in 89 (49.2%) patients using ASPI test, in 47 (26%) patients using ADP test, and in 113 (63.5%) patients using the TRAP test. Thirty-six (20%) patients exhibited an abnormal response to all three tests. Preoperative use of aspirin was documented in 35 (19.3%) patients, while clopidogrel use was documented in 7 (3.9%) patients. Patients with anormal ADP responses required more intraoperative red cell concentrates (3.4 ± 3.9 versus 2.1 ± 3.2, p = 0.039), intraoperative platelet concentrates (4.2 ± 2.9 versus 3.1 ± 2.4, p = 0.015) and total platelet concentrates (8.1 ± 7.8 versus 6.2 ± 8.1, p = 0.008). There were no significant differences in the need for surgical re-exploration, the total length of hospital stay, or 30-day mortality. Multiplate® aggregometry can be a useful tool for evaluating platelet dysfunction and assessing transfusion need in ATAAD patients, thereby aiding in the optimization of treatment strategies."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a true medical emergency that classically presents with sudden severe tearing chest pain that may radiate to the back or with tearing abdominal pain. When it presents atypically without pain, diagnostic delays or misdiagnosis are common, often with devastating consequences. We report the case of a 59-year-old male with uncontrolled hypertension who first presented to an outside emergency department (ED) with multiple collapses and was discharged after assessment. He presented 48 hours later to our ED following collapse and loss of consciousness. The patient was in shock upon arrival. Transient right upper limb weakness and slurring of speech were noted on initial assessment. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with cardiogenic shock was suspected on the basis of electrocardiographic (ECG) changes and raised troponin, and ACS treatment was administered. However, bedside echocardiogram performed to assess left ventricular function as part of the ACS work-up suggested Stanford type A AAD, which was confirmed by computed tomogram (CT) of the aorta. Emergency surgical repair of the aorta was performed after transfer to a tertiary hospital, with good postoperative recovery. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for aortic dissection in patients presenting with syncope and neurological deficits even in the absence of classical symptoms. Simulation training specifically tailored to scenarios of atypical presentations of AAD may be of benefit to emergency clinicians and help reduce the unacceptably high rate of misdiagnosis."

    "title": "Large extrapleural hematoma in a patient with Stanford type B acute aortic dissection: a case report.",
    "abstract": "Pleural effusion can occur in type B acute aortic dissection. Similar to pleural effusion, extrapleural hematoma is also a type of fluid located in the thoracic cavity. The manifestation of extrapleural hematoma on the chest X-ray is similar to pleural effusion; therefore, extrapleural hematoma can be misdiagnosed as pleural effusion by cardiovascular surgeons who are not familiar with it. We encountered a case of a large extrapleural hematoma in a patient with Stanford type B acute aortic dissection. After searching literature, we find that extrapleural hematoma is poorly described in literature and is an uncommon complication of acute aortic dissection, with few reports. To the authors' knowledge, our case is the second description of extrapleural hematoma in acute aortic dissection. Regarding the treatment of extrapleural hematoma in acute aortic dissection, there is not much information available and no common rules in the literature. The first reported case of extrapleural hematoma in acute aortic dissection adopted the surgical approach. We attempted nonsurgical conservative treatment, and the results proved it to be feasible. A 45-year-old Asian male patient from Chinese Han population presented to our emergency department complaining of abdominal pain for a second time. The second time he underwent contrast-enhanced computed tomography, which revealed an acute type B aortic dissection complicated by massive left hemothorax. Considering the rapid progression of the dissection, an emergency thoracic endovascular aortic repair was successfully performed. A chest tube was placed in the left pleural space; however, we failed to drain the fluid. Accordingly, surgical exploration via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was performed. Upon entering the pleural space, we observed a large extrapleural hematoma next to the aorta. Considering an inner leak in the aorta, the hematoma was managed conservatively. The patient showed rapid recovery without significant respiratory or circulatory compromise and was discharged nearly 1 month later without any symptoms of dyspnea and with stable hemoglobin levels. The extrapleural hematoma disappeared 5 months later. At 21 months after surgery, the patient was followed up telephonically and was found to be in good condition. Firstly, it is crucial to learn radiographic or ultrasonographic diagnostic features to reduce misdiagnoses of extrapleural hematoma. Secondly, extrapleural hematoma cannot be drained by chest tube drainage of the intrapleural space similar to pleural effusion. If classical chest tube drainage is unsuccessful, extrapleural hematoma should be suspected. Furthermore, we need to know how to deal with this rare entity of extrapleural hematoma in acute aortic dissection. Our case demonstrates that conservative treatment of extrapleural hematoma in acute aortic dissection is also an option, in addition to surgical treatment. We aim to share this conservative measure that has never been reported before. Our experience can serve as a reference for other doctors and fill the gap in literature."

    "abstract": "Stanford type A acute aortic dissection (AAD) is associated with a poor prognosis. Pulmonary artery intramural hematoma (PA-IMH) is an underrecognized complication of AAD. Here, we report a case of an 86-year-old man diagnosed with Stanford type A AAD. During emergency transfer to a tertiary care center with cardiovascular surgical capabilities, the patient experienced a cardiac arrest during transport by an ambulance and was subsequently pronounced dead. Postmortem computed tomography (CT) revealed right PA compression and wall thickening consistent with PA-IMH. Additionally, associated ground-glass opacity in the right lower lobe suggested alveolar hemorrhage, likely contributing to circulatory collapse, followed by cardiac arrest and death. We identified two important clinical issues. First, in cases of AAD, PA-IMH should be considered a potential complication when contrast-enhanced CT reveals obstruction or stenosis of the PA. Second, some cases of PA-IMH may present with alveolar hemorrhage, an important prognostic factor of PA-IMH that should be identified using CT with lung window settings."

    "title": "Narrative and Pictorial Review on State-of-the-Art Endovascular Treatment for Focal Non-Infected Lesions of the Abdominal Aorta: Anatomical Challenges, Technical Solutions, and Clinical Outcomes.",
    "abstract": "The natural history of focal non-infected lesions of the abdominal aorta (fl-AA) remains unclear and largely depends on their aetiology. These lesions often involve a focal \"tear\" or partial disruption of the arterial wall. Penetrating aortic ulcers (PAUs) and intramural hematomas (IMHs) are examples of focal tears in the aortic wall that can either progress to dilatation (saccular aneurysm) or fail to fully propagate through the medial layers, potentially leading to aortic dissection. These conditions typically exhibit a morphology consistent with eccentric saccular aneurysms. The management of focal non-infected pathologies of the abdominal aorta remains a subject of debate. Unlike fusiform abdominal aortic aneurysms, the inconsistent definitions and limited information regarding the natural history of saccular aneurysms (sa-AAAs) have prevented the establishment of universally accepted practice guidelines for their management. As emphasized in the latest 2024 ESVS guidelines, the focal nature of these diseases makes them ideal candidates for endovascular repair (class of evidence IIa-level C). Moreover, the Society for Vascular Surgery just referred to aneurysm diameter as an indication for treatment suggesting using a smaller diameter compared to fusiform aneurysms. Consequently, the management of saccular aneurysms is likely heterogeneous amongst different centres and different operators. Endovascular repair using tube stent grafts offers benefits like reduced recovery times but carries risks of migration and endoleak due to graft rigidity. These complications can influence long-term success. In this context, the use of endovascular bifurcated grafts may provide a more effective solution for treating these focal aortic pathologies. It is essential to achieve optimal sealing regions through anatomical studies of aortic morphology. Additionally, understanding the anatomical characteristics of focal lesions in challenging necks or para-visceral locations is indeed crucial in device choice. Off-the-shelf devices are favoured for their time and cost efficiency, but new endovascular technologies like fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) and custom-made devices enhance treatment success and patient safety. These innovations provide stent grafts in various lengths and diameters, accommodating different aortic anatomies and reducing the risk of type III endoleaks. Although complicated PAUs and focal saccular aneurysms rarely arise in the para-visceral aorta, the consequences of rupture in this segment might be extremely severe. Experience borrowed from complex abdominal and thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair demonstrates that fenestrated and branched devices can be deployed safely when anatomical criteria are respected. Elective patients derive the greatest benefit from a fenestrated graft, while urgent cases can be treated confidently with off-the-shelf multibranch systems, reserving other types of repairs for emergent or bail-out cases. While early outcomes of these interventions are promising, it is crucial to acknowledge that limited aortic coverage can still impede effective symptom relief and lead to complications such as aneurysm expansion or rupture. Therefore, further long-term studies are essential to consolidate the technical results and evaluate the durability of various graft options."

    "abstract": "Background: Acute Aortic Syndrome (AAS), encompassing aortic dissection (AD), intramural hematoma (IMH), and penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer (PAU), presents diagnostic challenges due to its varied manifestations and the critical need for rapid assessment. Methods: We developed a multi-stage deep learning model trained on chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans. The model utilizes a U-Net architecture for aortic segmentation, followed by a cascaded classification approach for detecting AD and IMH, and a multiscale CNN for identifying PAU. External validation was conducted on 260 anonymized CTA scans from 14 U.S. clinical sites, encompassing data from four different CT manufacturers. Performance metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Wilson's method. Model performance was compared against predefined benchmarks. Results: The model achieved a sensitivity of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.88-0.97), specificity of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.89-0.97), and an AUC of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94-0.98) for overall AAS detection, with p-values < 0.001 when compared to the 0.80 benchmark. Subgroup analyses demonstrated consistent performance across different patient demographics, CT manufacturers, slice thicknesses, and anatomical locations. Conclusions: This deep learning model effectively detects the full spectrum of AAS across diverse populations and imaging platforms, suggesting its potential utility in clinical settings to enable faster triage and expedite patient management."

    "abstract": "Patients with aortic dissection (AD) exhibit an elevated early mortality rate. A timely diagnosis is essential for successful management, but this is challenging. There are limited data delineating the factors contributing to a delayed diagnosis of AD. We conducted a scoping review to assess the time to diagnosis and explore the risk factors associated with a delayed diagnosis. This scoping review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We conducted online searches in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Bing, Wanfang Data Chinese database, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) Chinese database for studies that evaluated the diagnostic time and instances of delayed diagnoses of AD. A total of 27 studies were retrieved from our online searches and included in this scoping review. The time from symptom onset to diagnosis ranged from 40.5 min to 84.4 h, and the time from hospital presentation to diagnosis ranged from 0.5 h to 25 h. Multiple factors resulted in a significantly delayed diagnosis. Demographic and medical history predictors of delayed diagnosis included the female sex, age, North American versus European geographic location, initial AD, history of congestive heart failure, history of hyperlipidemia, distressed communities index >60, walk-in visits to the emergency department, those who transferred from a non-tertiary care hospital, and preoperative coronary angiography. Furthermore, chest and back pain, especially abrupt or radiating pain, low systolic blood pressure, pulse deficit, and malperfusion syndrome required less time for diagnostic confirmation. In contrast, painlessness, syncope, fever, pleural effusion, dyspnea, troponin positivity, and acute coronary syndrome-like electrocardiogram were more prevalent in patients with a delayed diagnosis. A recognition of the features associated with both typical and atypical presentations of AD is useful for a rapid diagnosis. Educational efforts to improve clinician awareness of the various presentations of AD and, ultimately, improve AD recognition may be relevant, particularly in non-tertiary hospitals with low exposure to aortic emergencies."

This underscores the critical need for expedited differential diagnosis in such clinical scenarios. An 80-year-old male presented with acute-onset left-sided hemiplegia and unresponsiveness. Initial cerebral neuroimaging demonstrated a substantial ischemic penumbra (136.2 ml Tmax >6 s) in the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory, with a core infarction volume of 13.6 ml. Emergency intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase was administered for presumed acute ischemic stroke, followed by mechanical thrombectomy via femoral artery access. Retrospective analysis of preoperative chest Computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed ascending aortic dilation. Subsequent emergency aortic CTA confirmed Stanford Type A dissection extending from the aortic root to the first lumbar vertebral level. Despite comprehensive risk counseling, the patient's family ultimately elected for discharge against medical advice. Telephone follow-up at 30 days post-discharge confirmed patient demise.

    "abstract": "A male patient in his 60s developed acute Stanford type B aortic dissection with malperfusion of the lower limbs in early June. Emergency surgery was performed. The surgery aimed to close the entry in the distal arch and involved a debranched thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). Postoperatively, malperfusion improved, but a type 1a endoleak persisted, and the distal arch aneurysm enlarged. Therefore, an additional TEVAR was performed in early October. Compared to the previous procedure, this TEVAR was placed just after the brachiocephalic artery in the central side. One week after surgery, the patient experienced severe chest pain in the early morning, prompting an emergency computed tomography (CT) scan. The diagnosis was retrograde type A aortic dissection (RTAD), and urgent surgery was planned. While considering blood supply options, the possibility of using blood from the previously debranched artificial vessel was evaluated. However, due to concerns about the narrow diameter of the artificial vessel and ensuring sufficient full flow, blood supply was performed from the cardiac apex. The entry of the dissection was located at the level of the brachiocephalic artery on the lesser curvature side, and an ascending arch aortic replacement was performed. The patient was extubated the day after surgery, and the postoperative course was favorable. The choice of blood supply for RTAD remained a challenge. Despite the risk of malperfusion with retrograde femoral artery blood supply, the surgeon chose the familiar cardiac apex approach, ultimately saving the patient's life."

From 2005 to 2021, patients undergoing surgery for type A aortic dissection at 18 European centres participating in the European registry of type A aortic dissection were included in this study. Based on the time of procedure, patients were allocated into groups (8 a.m. to 8 p.m. vs 8 p.m. to 8 a.m.). After propensity-score matching, short- and long-term all-cause mortality and reoperation rate as well as secondary end-points including myocardial infarction, neurological outcome and renal failure were compared. A total of 3902 patients were included in this study. After propensity-score matching, outcomes of 1475 pairs of patients were compared. No differences were found regarding rates of surgical techniques. Daytime surgery was associated with an increased rate of global brain injury [daytime 5.4% (n = 80) vs nighttime 3.6% (n = 53); P = 0.021]. No significant differences were found in the rates of myocardial infarction, renal failure or neurological outcome other than global brain ischaemia. Significantly higher 1-year mortality (24.8% vs 21.7%, P = 0.049) and 10-year mortality (48.7% vs 45.1%, P = 0.022) was demonstrated in the daytime group. No significant differences in the rates of reoperation at 10 years were found. This study demonstrates that surgery for type A aortic dissection performed during nighttime is not associated with adverse outcomes compared to daytime surgery, suggesting that nighttime procedures can be safely performed without compromising short- or long-term outcomes.

    "abstract": "Despite the life-saving nature of emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection (ATAD), debate persists on whether limited or extended arch repair is preferable. This study evaluates outcomes of redo total arch replacement after initial, limited arch repair for ATAD. We retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent ascending and arch repair from September 1999 to December 2024. Patients who underwent zone 2 or 3 arch replacement after limited arch repair for ATAD were included. Perioperative characteristics, operative outcomes, and overall survival were evaluated. Additionally, surgical outcomes over time were compared. In all, 2542 patients underwent ascending and arch repair, of whom 490 received a total arch replacement. Redo total arch replacement after limited arch repair for ATAD was performed on 101 patients. Emergent surgery was required in 5 (5%). Retrograde cerebral perfusion was utilized in 93 (92.1%). Profound/deep hypothermia was used in 36 (78%). Operative mortality was 6.9% (7 patients). Postoperative stroke occurred in 6.9%, and spinal cord injury occurred in 3.0%. Overall survival was 64.0% at 5 years and 57.9% at 10 years. There was improvement in operative mortality over time, though statistically insignificant (P = .059). Surgical outcomes of redo total arch replacement after limited arch repair for ATAD have been acceptable and shown dramatic improvement over the past decades."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissections (AAD) have a high morbidity and mortality rate. Treatment for type B aortic dissection includes strict systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) control per the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines. However, predictors of successful emergency department (ED) management of SBP have not been well studied. We retrospectively analyzed the records of adult patients presenting to any regional ED with type B AAD between 2017-2020 with initial SBP >120 mmHg and HR >60 beats per minute (bpm) and were subsequently transferred to our quaternary center. Primary outcome was SBP <120 mmHg based on both the 2010 and 2022 AHA guidelines and HR <60 bpm (based on the 2010 guideline), or HR <80 (2022 guideline). We used random forest (RF) algorithms, a machine-learning tool that uses clusters of decision trees to predict a categorical outcome, to identify predictors of achieving HR and SBP goals prior to ED departure, defined as the time point at which patients left the referring ED to come to our institution. The analysis included 134 patients. At the time of ED departure, 26 (19%) had SBP <120 mmHg, 96 (67%) received anti-impulse therapy, and 40 (28%) received beta-blocker or vasodilator infusions specifically. The RF algorithm identified higher triage SBP and treatment with intravenous labetalol as the top predictors for SBP >120 mmHg at ED departure, contrary to AHA guidelines. Pain management with higher total morphine equivalent unit, as well as shorter time to computed tomography as predictors for HR <60 bpm and <80 bpm, were in concert with AHA guidelines. Many patients with type B AAD did not achieve hemodynamic parameters in line with 2010 or 2022 AHA guidelines while being in the ED prior to transferring to a quaternary care center for further evaluation and management. Patients with higher heart rate and systolic blood pressure on ED arrival were less likely to achieve goals at the time of departure from the referring EDs. Those receiving more pain medications prior to transfer were more likely to meet certain AHA goals."

    "abstract": "Stanford Type A acute aortic dissection (AAD) complicated by mesenteric malperfusion has a mortality rate exceeding 60%. Conventional immediate central aortic repair may be inadequate in such complex cases. Emerging evidence suggests that a staged approach may improve outcomes. A 71-year-old male presented with acute chest pain and was diagnosed with Stanford Type A AAD extending to the abdominal aorta, with superior mesenteric artery (SMA) dissection leading to intestinal ischemia. To restore intestinal perfusion, emergency endovascular SMA stenting was performed as the initial intervention, followed by ascending aorta and total arch replacement using the frozen elephant trunk technique 12 hours later. The patient recovered without complications and was discharged ambulatory on postoperative day 20. This case highlights the efficacy of a staged approach prioritizing mesenteric revascularization before central aortic repair in AAD complicated by visceral malperfusion. By first addressing end-organ ischemia, we potentially mitigated the risk of irreversible bowel necrosis while enabling subsequent central aortic repair. Our experience adds to the growing body of evidence supporting individualized, pathophysiology-guided treatment strategies for this challenging clinical scenario."

    "abstract": "This study delineates the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for acute myocardial infarction occurring years after stent implantation for Stanford type A aortic dissection. Emergency coronary angiography presented substantial technical challenges attributable to the lack of recent aortic imaging data and marked tortuosity of the brachiocephalic trunk resulting from postoperative anatomical changes. Consequently, while selective left coronary angiography was successfully completed, visualization of the right coronary artery necessitated non-selective contrast administration via a pigtail catheter. This case underscores the pivotal role of preoperative aortic computed tomography angiography (CTA) in hemodynamically stable patients, as it provides essential vascular anatomical information that may circumvent procedural complexities during coronary angiography. Building upon these observations, we advocate an \"aorto-coronary combined assessment\" strategy for post-aortic surgery patients, integrating systematic imaging surveillance to facilitate early identification of coronary lesions. Such an approach permits the timely implementation of intensive medical therapy or elective revascularization, thereby mitigating the risk of acute cardiovascular events."

While vasculitis commonly leads to systemic inflammation, large vessel complications like aortitis or dissection are less well-documented. A male in his 50s with hypertension presented with sudden-onset, severe chest pain radiating to his back and shortness of breath. Pain slightly improved with opioids. Initial CT showed moderate thickening of the thoracic aorta, suggestive of vasculitis. High-dose steroids were started. Autoimmune tests confirmed elevated c-ANCA and anti-proteinase 3 antibodies. A follow-up CT angiography later revealed a Stanford type A aortic dissection extending from the thoracic to the abdominal aorta, involving the superior mesenteric artery and inferior mesenteric artery. The patient was urgently transferred for surgical intervention. Initial treatment with steroids was based on suspected vasculitis. The discovery of a Stanford type A aortic dissection required urgent surgical repair. Timely imaging was critical in identifying this severe complication, leading to rapid transfer for surgery. This case highlights the rare but serious possibility of aortic involvement in c-ANCA-associated vasculitis. It underscores the importance of serial imaging to detect and manage severe complications early, emphasizing adaptable treatment strategies for better outcomes."

    "abstract": "Lower back pain is among the top ten reasons patients visit the emergency department (ED). Tizanidine, a centrally acting alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, is commonly prescribed for managing spasticity in patients with cerebral or spinal injuries. It is also used as an effective treatment for nonspecific lower back pain. One of the most critical and life-threatening causes of lower back pain is abdominal aortic dissection, particularly in patients with hypertension. Nifedipine, a 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB), is a widely used oral antihypertensive and antianginal agent. It lowers systemic vascular resistance and dilates coronary arteries by inhibiting calcium ion (Ca²⁺) entry into the smooth muscle cells of small arteries (arterioles), thereby reducing systemic blood pressure and improving myocardial oxygen delivery. We report a compelling case of a male patient presenting to the ED with high blood pressure and lower back pain. Shortly after the administration of tizanidine and nifedipine, his blood pressure dropped significantly within an hour. Initially suspected to be a ruptured abdominal aortic dissection, the cause was later identified as a drug-drug interaction. The synergistic effects of tizanidine and nifedipine resulted in a rapid and critical drop in blood pressure. The Drug Interaction Probability Scale (DIPS) score of 4 suggests the hypotensive episode was possibly caused by a drug interaction. This case also highlights the importance of point of care ultrasound (POCUS) and repeated examinations in excluding life-threatening conditions like aortic rupture."

    "abstract": "Cibenzoline (CBZ), a class I antiarrhythmic drug, is used for patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). However, it requires careful monitoring in patients with renal dysfunction for potential toxicity. We present a case of severe CBZ toxicity in a 72-year-old woman with HOCM, previous ascending aortic dissection repair, and renal dysfunction. She was maintained on CBZ 300 mg daily despite fluctuating renal function. She presented with acute respiratory distress. On presentation, she was found to have bradycardia with QRS prolongation (340 ms) and markedly elevated CBZ levels (1973 ng/mL, therapeutic range: 200-800 ng/mL). She developed sudden cardiac arrest in the emergency room. Following cardiac arrest, venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) was initiated. Direct hemoperfusion yielded minimal reduction in CBZ levels. With increased urine output, CBZ levels normalized, accompanied by electrocardiographic improvement. After VA-ECMO withdrawal, percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation (PTSMA) was performed as definitive treatment to eliminate CBZ dependency. This case illustrates the complex interaction between HOCM, renal impairment, and CBZ toxicity, emphasizing the importance of careful drug monitoring in patients with renal impairment. Additionally, it demonstrates the potential role of PTSMA as a definitive treatment for selected patients with HOCM at high risk of medication-related complications. •Understand the pharmacokinetics of cibenzoline and its need for monitoring in elderly patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) and impaired renal function.•Recognize the mechanisms of cibenzoline toxicity and its acute management strategies, including mechanical circulatory support and direct hemoperfusion.•Identify the acute management strategies and long-term treatment options for complications arising from medical therapy in patients with HOCM."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and clinical outcomes of endovascular aortic arch repair using the Nexus and Nexus Duo endograft systems. A multicenter, retrospective study with prospectively collected data was conducted as part of the Italian Nexus Aortic aRCH Endovascular Repair Registry (INARCHER) between 2019 and 2024. Nexus platforms include an off-the-shelf bimodular single branch endograft and a custom-made double-branch device. Patients who underwent endovascular aortic arch repair with the Nexus and Nexus Duo endograft systems at participating centers were included. The study addressed both aortic arch aneurysm and dissection. Data collection included baseline patient characteristics, procedural details, and follow-up results. The primary endpoints were early (30 days) major adverse events, major stroke, and mortality. Secondary endpoints included the need for device-related reintervention and the device-related endoleak. We collected 31 cases from 11 centers. The mean age was 73.4 ± 7.32 years, and 77.4% were male. Thirteen patients had a degenerative aneurysm, three had a pseudoaneurysm after prior surgical repair, two had penetrating aortic ulcers, and 13 had an aortic dissection (subacute, n = 1; chronic, n = 12). Prior ascending aorta replacement was present in 15 cases (48.4%). Seven patients (22.6%) received urgent treatment. Twenty-five cases were treated with complete supra-aortic trunks debranching and Nexus, six cases with left subclavian artery-left common carotid artery debranching and Nexus Duo. The mean operative time was 230 ± 73 minutes. Technical success was achieved in 97% of procedures owing to one case of type IA endoleak. Perioperative mortality was 6.5%, related to a massive pulmonary embolism and a cardiac arrest. Major strokes occurred in 6.5%. The major adverse event rate was 22.6%. The mean follow-up period was 29.7 ± 24.9 months. Beyond 30 days, there was no aortic-related mortality, and freedom from related reintervention was 97% (95% confidence interval, 91%-100%). The use of the Nexus and Nexus Duo endograft systems appears to be a safe option for the treatment of aortic arch dissection and aneurysm, with complication rates consistent with existing literature for such high-complexity cases. Endovascular aortic arch repair remains a challenging procedure with non-negligible neurologic complication, requiring ongoing improvements to enhance patient outcomes."

Emergency medical services declared him dead on arrival. An autopsy examination disclosed 2750 g of blood in the left pleural cavity and a 2.5 cm transverse tear in a saccular aneurysm on the descending thoracic aorta with aortic dissection (AD). Histopathological analysis confirmed necrosis, fibrosis, and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate at the rupture site, with features consistent with healed myocardial infarction and grade VII atherosclerosis.

    "abstract": "This case report highlights the importance of prehospital point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) when acute aortic dissection is suspected. At 2:09 pm the local emergency medical services (EMS) received a call from a small town in Lombardy, Italy, reporting that a 54-years-old man had collapsed while lifting weights in a fitness club. Response teams found him lying on the floor, fully responsive and very pale; he was a lean man, with no allergies, no home therapy and no significant past medical history. He had had a transient facial paralysis and complained of dizziness and mild chest discomfort. During physical examination he became suddenly hypotensive (60/30 mmHg). The electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm, 80 beats per minute (bpm) and unaltered T wave and ST segment. The POCUS showed a dilated aortic root with intimal flap and small pericardial effusion. A diagnosis of Type A acute aortic dissection was made on the spot. The EMS dispatch center identified the closest hospital with available cardiothoracic surgery and provided a full report of the patient's condition, diagnosis and initial treatment. At 3:10 pm, the patient entered the emergency room and a rapid transthoracic ultrasound confirming the diagnosis was performed in the presence of the cardiac anesthetist and cardiothoracic surgeon. The patient was agitated, tachycardic (110 bpm) and hypotensive (50/30 mmHg). Upon stabilization with intravenous norepinephrine and fluids, a computed tomographic angiogram was performed demonstrating a Stanford Type A aortic dissection with intimal flap starting from the bulb/valvular plane and extending to the origin of supra-aortic trunks down to the left common iliac artery. At 4.00 pm the patient was ready for surgery; he underwent successful ascending aorta replacement with a regular postoperative course and no signs of neurological damage. On post-operative day eight he was referred to an inpatient cardiac rehabilitation facility and later discharged home. At prehospital level, POCUS is feasible and may provide key diagnostic findings in some threatening medical (non-trauma-related) conditions that are normally diagnosticated only once the patient has reached the hospital. In addition, this report highlights a perfect interaction between out-of-hospital medical personnel, dispatch center and in-hospital multidisciplinary health staff."

An abdominal ultrasound revealed a right dissected common iliac aneurysm, left common iliac aneurysm and an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Further investigation confirmed the same findings. Several hours later, the decision of emergency surgery was done due to signs of hemorrhagic shock caused by ruptured unilateral iliac aneurysm. The aneurysms were successfully repaired by aorto-bi-iliac dacron-graft bypass and palpable femoral pulses noted at the end of the surgery. Close monitoring of these patients is crucial due to the significant morbidity associated. Early intervention may be necessary, particularly before any signs of deterioration and hemorrhagic shock."

Endovascular bare metal stent (BMS) use may be an alternative option for abdominal aorta remodeling, but evidence supporting its efficacy is still limited. This study investigated the effects of BMS in the abdominal aorta. Patients who initially underwent emergent surgical procedures, such as ascending aortic grafting, the Bentall procedure, or valve-sparing ascending aortic repair, and later received reintervention surgeries during follow-up, including traditional total arch replacement or hybrid endovascular arch debranching combined with thoracic endovascular aortic repair, were enrolled. Patients were categorized into 2 groups: a non-BMS group and BMS group. Outcomes were analyzed over a 5-year follow-up period. A total of 22 patients received a BMS, whereas 22 patients did not. In the abdominal aorta segment, the BMS group had significantly greater true lumen expansion and increased false lumen thrombosis than the non-BMS group at 5 years of follow-up (P < 0.001∗ for true lumen expansion; P = 0.024∗ for thrombosis). In addition, positive abdominal aortic remodeling was observed more frequently in the BMS group than in the non-BMS group (5 vs. 0 patients, P = 0.048∗). During the 5-year observation period, abdominal BMS effectively and consistently promoted true lumen expansion, increased false lumen thrombosis, and resulted in positive aortic remodeling. However, these radiologic improvements did not translate into significant differences in 5-year overall survival or freedom from reintervention. Nonetheless, this approach may be a viable option for abdominal aortic remodeling in the chronic phase."

Exploratory analysis of a national audit conducted by the Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthesia and Critical Care. From a total of 270 participants diagnosed with AAD with an STS time <72 hours, 218 were included in the multivariate analysis, after excluding 52 participants with missing covariates. STS time, measured in hours. Hospital mortality at 30 days. In the multivariate analysis, mean STS time for misdiagnosed patients was nearly twice as high when compared with patients who initially had the correct diagnosis (estimated proportion of change=1.9, 95% CI 1.5 to 2.3, p<0.001). STS time decreased when patients were accompanied by a medical doctor in the ambulance transfer, had mean arterial blood pressure below 70 mm Hg or presented to the emergency department (ED) with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) <15. Estimated ED-to-surgery (ETS) times were 1.8 hours longer for women than for men (10.5 hours, 95% CI 9.0 to 12.0 hours vs 8.7 hours, 95% CI 7.8 to 9.6 hours). From a total of 334 patients, 64 (19.2%) died. Mortality was higher in older patients and when STS time was ≥6 and <24 hours, compared with STS time <6 hours. Potentially modifiable factors that may reduce STS times include avoidance of misdiagnosis and provision of a medical doctor for the ambulance transfer. Younger women had longer STS and ETS times, but further research is warranted to investigate the impact of age and sex on these times. The relationship between STS time and hospital mortality among these patients remains unclear."

A cohort of 1,277 patients from the China Aortic Dissection Alliance (CADA) registry was chronologically split into derivation (70%, n = 894) and validation (30%, n = 383) sets. LASSO regression with 10-fold cross-validation (λ1SE criterion) was applied to identify non-redundant predictors from 34 candidate variables (e.g., cardiac dysfunction [LVEF <50% or INTERMACS 1-3]) and elevated urinary biomarkers. Multivariable logistic regression refined these predictors to establish independent risk factors for the final nomogram. Model performance was evaluated using the concordance index (C-index), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), calibration plots (Brier score and Hosmer-Lemeshow test), and decision curve analysis (DCA) to quantify clinical utility. Multivariable analysis identified seven independent predictors of postoperative AKI: preexisting cardiac dysfunction (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.17; 95% CI: 1.68-3.56), microvascular complications of diabetes (aOR = 3.26; 2.71-4.34), baseline renal impairment (aOR = 1.72; 1.36-3.29), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) ≥ 20 mg/dL (aOR = 2.19; 1.57-3.64), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 (aOR = 1.47; 1.02-2.13), serum creatinine >1.3 mg/dL (aOR = 3.28; 2.58-3.75), and peripheral vasculopathy (aOR = 1.78; 1.12-2.32).

Genetic testing then confirmed Marfan's syndrome, and she was followed by vascular medicine specialists and optimized medically. Several other family members also tested positive and imaging revealed aortic abnormalities. She arrived at our institution endorsing severe nausea, vomiting, back, flank, and abdominal pain. She was found on imaging to have a rapidly degenerating type II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) with dissection. A multidisciplinary team evaluated the patient and working with cardiothoracic (CT) surgery, our initial plan was an open repair. Following admission to the ICU, her symptoms improved with tight blood pressure control; however, she rapidly clinically decompensated with worsening pain and hypotension the day prior to her planned open repair. A massive transfusion protocol was initiated and CT scan revealed more than a 1 cm growth and evolution of her dissection. At the time, the CT surgery group were in cases and could not free an attending, and therefore recommended that we temporize the situation with balloon control and a fenestrated repair. We emergently proceeded to the operating room and obtained balloon control prior to induction of anesthesia while the 4-vessel fenestrated/branched endograft (F/BEVAR) was constructed. Repair was carried out with a bifurcated graft into the bilateral iliac arteries. However, following the endovascular repair, the patient did not want to proceed with a large open surgery and was managed definitively with endovascular means and ultimately required reintervention for a type 3 endoleak (EL) (bridging TEVAR) and type 1B EL requiring hypogastric preservation to minimize spinal cord ischemia. CT scan prior to discharge revealed only a type 2 EL, and she was discharged home with full motor and sensory function. Approximately 1 year later, a CT scan revealed regression of the aneurysm near her visceral segment, but growth near the aortic bifurcation and a type 2 EL. This was treated with a trans-caval approach and embolization of several segmental branches and the aneurysm sac with thrombin and gelfoam. Subsequent CT scans over the next 2 years have shown continued sac regression. This case serves as an example that an endovascular repair may play a role in the emergent treatment of complex anatomies in patients with Marfan syndrome especially when refusing open surgery. This repair has to date shown mid-term success with near-complete aneurysm sac regression and no endoleak, but to achieve this the patient has required strict surveillance and 2 reinterventions in the first year following the index case. Ultimately, this represents one of the first ruptured TAAA in a Marfan patient treated with a F/BEVAR.Clinical ImpactPatients with genetic aortopathies are at risk for aneurysmal degeneration and disease progression. It is important to manage patients with genetic aortopathies expeditiously and in emergency settings a total endovascular approach can be used. Each case requires a multidisciplinary approach and thoughtful planning."

    "title": "Lactate as a Preoperative Predictor of Mortality in Patients Undergoing Emergency Type A Aortic Dissection Repair.",
    "abstract": "Background: Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition where emergent surgical repair is the standard of care. However, despite operative intervention, mortality is 10-15% in all patients. Objective markers to distinguish when surgical repair is more beneficial versus being futile are warranted. Currently, no such known measures are widely agreed upon. Since most complications from aortic dissection stem from malperfusion, serum lactate is thought to be a surrogate marker for malperfusion. This scoping review aims to examine the preoperative predictive value of lactate or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in assessing postoperative mortality in patients undergoing surgical repair for acute Stanford Type A aortic dissection (ATAAD). Methods: PubMed was searched for the following search terms: \"Dissection, Ascending Aorta\", \"Dissection, Thoracic Aorta\", or \"Aortic Dissection\". Prospective and retrospective randomized controlled trials, case reports, and cohort studies were included in the initial search. Studies were first screened for inclusion of preoperative lactate or LDH level with a search of \"lac\" or \"LDH\". Included studies consisted of patients aged 18 or older diagnosed with Stanford Type A/Debakey Type I and II aortic dissection with reported preoperative lactate or LDH levels and postoperative mortality treated within 14 days of symptom onset. Preoperative laboratory values were measured from samples collected prior to patient transfer to the operating room or before utilization of ECMO intraoperatively. Results: A comprehensive database search identified a total of 4722 articles. After a rigid screening process, 46 studies fit the inclusion criteria. These papers reported a combined 4696 participants with either preoperative lactate or LDH levels and postoperative mortality. The mean preoperative lactate level was 2.4 mmol/L, whereas the LDH level was 424.9 U/L. Postoperative mortality was 16.51%. Average creatinine, BUN, platelets, INR, PT, PTT, and hemoglobin were all within normal lab analysis limits. Conclusions: Neither lactate nor LDH should be used as a solo predictor of postoperative mortality after ATAAD due to lack of consensus on the cut-off values. Accompanying clinical signs, lab abnormalities, and radiographic findings taken together may be better predictors of prognosis."

    "abstract": "Aortic injury is a life-threatening complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), and it occurs in 0.6% to 1.9% of cases. An 81-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis and peripheral arterial disease (kissing iliac stents) presented for TAVR. Mild resistance was encountered when introducing the 14-F TAVR catheter through an 18-F sheath, but the catheter passed with gentle pressure. While the catheter was advancing up the aorta, a large, calcified mass was seen moving with the distal tip. Retraction of the catheter also retracted the seemingly attached calcific mass. Angiography revealed a catheter-induced avulsed atheroma but no perforation. The TAVR delivery catheter was carefully removed, and the calcific lesion settled infrarenally. Kissing iliac stenting was performed, raising the aortic bifurcation to the juxtarenal aorta and covering the mobile plaque. Angiography showed patent stents with excellent distal aortic and lower extremity runoff. Although rare, aortic complications can be devastating. Here, emergency multidisciplinary assistance was critical for a successful endovascular result."

    "abstract": "The Frozen Elephant Trunk (FET) technique is indicated in acute aortic syndromes with arch involvement and malperfusion of tissues. We sought to report on long-term outcomes of FET in emergent cases of acute aortic syndromes. Methods: Twenty-three adult patients were referred to our department for surgical management of acute aortic syndromes and underwent aortic arch replacement using the FET technique between November 2010 and January 2022. The primary outcome was long-term survival. Secondary outcomes were the 30-day mortality rate and the incidence of neurologic complications, i.e., stroke and spinal cord ischemia. Results: The mean patient age was 57.1 (±12.5) years, and the majority (20 patients, 87%) were male. The most common indication was Stanford type A acute aortic dissection (aTAAD) in 17 (74%) patients, followed by non-A non-B dissection in 2 (8.7%) patients, penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU) of the aortic arch in 2 (8.7%) patients, type A intramural hematoma (IMH) in 1 (4.3%) patient and blunt thoracic aortic injury of the aortic arch in 1 (4.3%) patient. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a 73% survival at 12 months, which persisted up to 11 years of follow-up. Conclusion: The FET technique provides a reliable solution for surgical management of patients with acute aortic syndromes. Excellent, sustained long-term results can be achieved."

    "title": "Relationship between perioperative plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin level and acute kidney injury after acute type A aortic dissection.",
    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a prevalent and life-threatening emergency in cardiovascular surgery. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common perioperative complication of ATAAD. The mechanism of occurrence is multi-factor. The traditional assessment of renal function might be postponed and better biomarkers are needed to predict AKI. This study simultaneously evaluated perioperative plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) levels during ATAAD surgery to predict the risk of postoperative. Total of 104 ATAAD patients were included in this research. Blood samples were collected from the patients at different time points: before surgery (T1), at the end of hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA) (T2), at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (T3), 24 hours post-operation (T4), and 48 hours post-operation (T5). The patients were grouped based on whether the AKI occurred after surgery, and we compared levels of plasma NGAL across different time points. Additionally, we constructed a multivariate logistic regression model using preoperative and intraoperative data from the patients, incorporating plasma NGAL as a predictor to assess its predictive capability. Based on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria, the occurrence of AKI among the 104 ATAAD patients was found to be 39.4% (41 out of 104). Within this group, 12 patients were categorized as KDIGO stage 1, 11 as stage 2, and 18 as stage 3; additionally, 14 patients required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Plasma NGAL levels were elevated at all measured time points for AKI patients compared to non-AKI group. Subgroup analysis revealed that plasma NGAL levels in patients with severe AKI (sAKI) consistently exceeded those in mild AKI (mAKI) cases, while no significant difference was observed between mAKI and non-AKI groups. Plasma NGAL demonstrated predictive capability for sAKI at each time point, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.739 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.616-0.861; P<0.001] recorded at T5. Independent risk factors for postoperative AKI in ATAAD patients included preoperative ejection fraction [odds ratio (OR): 0.90; 95% CI: 0.81-0.99; P=0.043], D-dimer level (OR: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.01-1.09; P=0.01), and plasma NGAL level (OR: 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01-1.04; P=0.01). The perioperative levels of plasma NGAL in patients who developed AKI after ATAAD were notably elevated compared to those without AKI. Furthermore, plasma NGAL demonstrated strong predictive capability for severe postoperative AKI."

    "abstract": "Stanford type A aortic dissection (TAAD) is a critical cardiovascular emergency characterized by acute onset, rapid progression, severe clinical manifestations, high mortality rates, and frequent complications. Patient's postoperative experiences are closely linked to their physical and mental health. Therefore, understanding their illness experience is essential to facilitate recovery. This study aimed to explore disease perception and postoperative experience of TAAD patients through semi-structured interviews, providing a formulation for developing standardized postoperative management protocols. A phenomenological qualitative study was conducted in the cardiac and vascular surgery department of a tertiary hospital in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region between January and May 2023. Purposive sampling was used to recruit postoperative TAAD patients. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore disease perception and experiences. Interview data were analyzed using Colaizzi's seven-step analysis. A total of 16 patients were interviewed. Based on the interview data, 296 codes were extracted and pooled into 17 subthemes, which were finally integrated into 4 themes related to disease perception and experiences: significant symptom burden, complex and varied psychological experiences, different coping styles, and diverse needs for health services. Postoperative TAAD patients face numerous health challenges. Healthcare providers should closely monitor physical symptoms, systematically address psychological fluctuations, develop targeted interventions based on identified coping patterns, and design patient-centered care models to address unmet needs. These strategies may alleviate adverse experiences and enhance rehabilitation outcomes."

    "abstract": "There are many causes of pericardial effusion and if the accumulating fluid results in cardiac tamponade, it may lead to life-threatening haemodynamic collapse. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of cardiac tamponade is critical. A 53-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with chest pain and undifferentiated shock. A computer tomography (CT) aortogram showed a pericardial effusion, active contrast extravasation (possibly arising from the right coronary artery), but no aortic dissection. Echocardiography confirmed a large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology. The consensus between cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery was for urgent coronary angiography to identify the source of bleeding. This showed a network of vessels from the right coronary artery that appeared to supply a mass. Re-review of the CT scan and repeat targeted echocardiography showed the silhouette of a mass adjacent to the right atrium. The patient was taken immediately for cardiac surgery. A cardiac tumour extending through the right atrial wall was identified, resected, and subsequently was diagnosed histologically as a cardiac angiosarcoma. Malignancy is responsible for only a small proportion of pericardial effusions and metastatic disease is overwhelmingly more common than primary cardiac neoplasms. This case highlights the use of multi-modality cardiac imaging to guide diagnosis and treatment, and the need to consider the rarer causes of haemopericardium in cases where the more common causes have been excluded."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection is a rare and life-threatening condition with highly variable clinical presentations, often resulting in atypical symptoms and initial misdiagnosis. This study aimed to investigate clinical presentations and explore the associations between clinical characteristics, delayed diagnosis, and in-hospital mortality among patients with acute aortic dissection. A retrospective chart review was performed on patients presenting with acute aortic dissection at an urban academic emergency department in Thailand between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2020. Baseline characteristics, clinical presentations, imaging findings, delayed diagnosis (>4 h from first emergency department contact), and in-hospital mortality rates were analyzed. The study included 103 patient charts, predominately men (71 patients), with a median age of 71 years (interquartile range of 58-78 years). Abdominal pain (36.9%) and thoracic pain (24.3%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Dyspnea (11.7%), altered consciousness (4.9%), and syncope (4.9%) were the three main painless presenting atypical symptoms. Atypical presentations were not significantly associated with delayed diagnosis, which occurred in 27.2% of cases. Normotension, a history of coronary artery disease, and pleural effusion were associated with delayed diagnosis. Abnormal chest films were major risk factors for in-hospital mortality, observed in 22.3% of patients with acute aortic dissection, whereas delayed diagnosis was not directly related to such mortality. The incidence of acute aortic dissection in the urban Thai population was 32.4 per 100,000 patient-years, with a range of clinical presentations. A high index of suspicion for AAD is crucial for timely diagnosis, even in patients with atypical symptoms and seemingly normal vital signs. Careful interpretation of chest radiographs is essential as abnormal chest X-ray findings are associated with a poorer prognosis."

    "abstract": "Background: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is at the forefront of structural heart programs all over the world. With a growing number of TAVR procedures in lower-risk and younger patients, acute and chronic complications require decisive treatment. The aim of the present study is to retrospectively analyze the efficacy of surgical bailout strategies in case of complications from TAVR that had been performed in the highest-volume center in Italy over the past ten years. Methods: Acute complications were defined as events occurring in the first 24 h after surgery, while chronic complications were defined as events occurring within the first year post-implant. We retrospectively analyzed the 2731 patients who had undergone TAVR at our institution from January 2015 to August 2024. Results: A total of 21 patients were included, with a median age of 78 years (IQR 11y). The majority of patients underwent TAVR with a self-expanding prosthesis (76%). A total of 11 patients (52%) presented acute complications, of which the most common were aortic dissection (n = 4 [19%]) followed by left ventricular perforation (n = 3 [14%]). The most common chronic complication was early endocarditis (n = 5 [24%]). The most common bailout strategy was aortic valve replacement (AVR), which was sufficient in 10 patients (48%), followed by complete root replacement (n = 4 [19%]). In-hospital mortality was higher in acute compared with chronic complications albeit not statistically significant (n = 4 [36%] vs. n = 2 [20%], p = 0.64), highlighting the very high risk of all these surgeries. Conclusions: Bailout and post-TAVR surgery are critical issues, with overall acceptable yet significant mortality considering the very high risk of these procedures. In our experience, half of the overall complications cannot be resolved with a simple explant and subsequent valve replacement, thereby underlining the importance of skilled cardiothoracic surgery teams on site to address complex issues such as ventricular perforation and emergency aortic/root replacement."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Type B aortic dissection occurring after labor can be life-threatening. Severe hypertension is among the main risk factors. This report highlights the role of early intervention and special monitoring of pregnant women, and their effects on symptoms. CASE REPORT A 28-year-old women with a history of hypertension was admitted to the obstetrics hospital. Two attempts at labor induction were unsuccessful. A decision was made to proceed with a cesarean section. Due to the patient's deteriorating condition, 2 laparotomies were performed, 1 at the initial hospital and another after transfer. Postoperatively, she required intensive care monitoring. Based on imaging studies, a diagnosis of type B thoracoabdominal aortic dissection complicated by malperfusion was established. Endovascular aortic repair involved placement of an aortic stent graft under imaging guidance. A Zenith TX2 Dissection endovascular stent graft with a Pro Form Z-Track Plus delivery system was introduced. Afterward, the patient underwent 2 more surgeries: duodenum resection and creation of a gastro-descending colon anastomosis. Upon hospital admission, the patient was in very serious general condition. However, after 2 months of treatment and improvement, she was discharged. CONCLUSIONS This report demonstrates that hypertension during pregnancy, combined with unsuccessful attempts at delivery, may be a significant risk factor for aortic dissection. Effective diagnosis and management of these patients is challenging and requires multidisciplinary care, including the use of computed tomography with contrast as soon as possible due to its higher benefits, and the immediate endovascular approach as the safest method of treating postpartum aortic dissection."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the midterm outcomes of a novel embedded modular single-branched stent-graft (EMSBSG) designed to preserve the left subclavian artery (LSA) of type B aortic dissection (TBAD). From December 2020 to November 2021, a total of 120 patients with TBAD treated with an EMSBSG were enrolled in a multicenter prospective clinical trial at 18 Chinese tertiary hospitals. Follow-up computed tomography angiography scanning was conducted at 1, 6, and 12 months postprocedure. The technical success rate was 99.17% (n = 119/120), with only 1 technical failure attributed to aortic intimo-intimal intussusception. The 30-day mortality rate was 0.83% (n = 1). Thirty-day major complications included 2 cases (1.67%) of retrograde type A aortic dissection (RTAD), 3 cases (2.50%) of stroke, and 6 cases (5.22%) of Type Ia endoleaks. The median follow-up time was 12.84 (range, 11-16) months. The 1-year mortality rate was 4.17% (n = 5/120), and the follow-up patency rate of the branch section was 99.09% (n = 109/110). The overall 12-month reintervention rate was 4.17% (n = 5), including 3 RTAD cases, 2 Type I endoleaks, and 1 stent-induced new entry. For patients with TBAD involving the LSA, the midterm outcomes are encouraging for EMSBSG as a relatively safe, effective, and noncustomized endovascular option. However, long-term outcomes warrant attention and further investigation.Clinical ImpactThe midterm outcomes indicate that EMSBSG offers a safe, and effective endovascular option for preserving the LSA in patients with TBAD. The EMSBSG achieves LSA preservation through a non-customized endovascular solution, making it particularly suitable for emergency procedures. The core innovation of EMSBSG lies in its flexible, modular Embedded design, which adapts to the anatomical characteristics of TBAD in patients."

    "abstract": "Folate metabolites have been identified as prognostic markers in cardiovascular, oncologic, and congenital diseases. However, few studies have explored the association between serum folic acid levels and aortic rupture. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of serum folic acid level for pre-operative adverse events in patients with symptomatic aortic aneurysm/aortic dissection. Patients with symptomatic aortic aneurysm/aortic dissection, presenting to the emergency department (ED), were enrolled in the study. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify predictors of pre-operative aortic rupture. The optimal cut-off value for folic acid was determined, and a prognostic nomogram was subsequently developed for potential clinical application. Among 639 symptomatic aortic aneurysm/aortic dissection patients, 8.61% experienced rupture prior to surgery/intervention, with a significantly higher incidence observed in patients with higher serum folic acid levels. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that folic acid levels ≥9ng/mL were an independent risk factor for pre-operative aortic rupture (OR=2.41). A nomogram was developed based on the combination of Stanford type A aortic dissection, folic acid level, white blood cell count, serum potassium, and random blood glucose, demonstrating excellent discrimination ability with the area under the curve of 0.801. This large-sample, prospective study suggested that the serum folic acid level was an independent predictor of pre-operative aortic rupture in patients with symptomatic aortic aneurysm/aortic dissection. The developed nomogram highlighted the prognostic value of folic acid and other objective clinical markers, offering a practical tool for early risk stratification, particularly in the ED setting."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection, particularly acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD), is a life-threatening cardiovascular emergency with alarmingly high mortality rates globally. Despite advancements in imaging techniques like computed tomography angiography (CTA), delayed diagnosis and incomplete understanding of molecular mechanisms persist, contributing to poor outcomes. Recent studies highlight the role of immune dysregulation, vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) apoptosis, and metabolic-epigenetic interactions in AD pathogenesis, underscoring the need for novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This study aims to identify critical genes and molecular pathways associated with ATAAD, develop a multi-omics diagnostic model, and evaluate potential therapeutic interventions to improve clinical outcomes. Transcriptome datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were analyzed using differential expression analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and machine learning algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, LASSO regression). Functional enrichment and immunoinfiltration analyses were performed to explore biological pathways and immune cell interactions. External dataset validation and PCR testing of clinical samples (n = 9) were conducted to confirm gene expression differences. A nomogram diagnostic model was constructed and evaluated for predictive accuracy. Six core genes were identified: Ccl2, Cdh8, Hk2, Tph1, Npy1r, and Slc24a4, with four (Ccl2, Hk2, Tph1, and Npy1r) showing significant differential expression in clinical validation. Functional enrichment revealed associations with immune cell migration, vascular development regulation, extracellular matrix pathways, and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Immunoinfiltration analysis demonstrated increased infiltration of B cell precursors, resting NK cells, and M2 macrophages in ATAAD tissues, negatively correlating with core gene expression. The nomogram model exhibited high diagnostic precision (AUC=0.935, 95% CI: 0.908-0.963), supported by calibration and decision curve analyses. This study identifies key molecular markers and pathways in ATAAD pathogenesis, emphasizing the role of immune dysregulation and extracellular matrix remodeling. The multi-omics diagnostic model provides a novel tool for early screening, potentially reducing mortality through timely intervention. These findings advance the understanding of aortic dissection mechanisms and offer actionable targets for future research and clinical applications."

Prospective, observational study. Cardiac surgery intensive care unit. Consecutive patients who were diagnosed with AAD and operated at the Cardiac Medical Center of Fujian Province between December 2020 and December 2022. Patients were classiffed into two groups according to the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit: POD group and NON-POD group. Each patient's plasma was tested before emergency surgery. Baseline demographic data and preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative clinical data were collected. The short-term clinical outcomes were followed up daily. The rate of POD was calculated. The risk factors for POD were analyzed through univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the ability of plasma galectin-3 to predict POD. A total of 309 study subjects were included in this study, and the rate of POD was 38.8%. Patients with AAD were categorized into the POD and NON-POD cohorts postoperatively based on their CAM-ICU scores. There was no statistically significant difference in the baseline characteristics between the two groups (P > 0.05). However, patients in the POD group had significantly elevated plasma galectin-3 levels (P < 0.001). The ROC curves showed that plasma galectin-3 had a sensitivity of 72.5% and a specificity of 70.9% as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of POD. The critical value of plasma galectin-3 for diagnosing POD was 9.18 ng/mL. Plasma galectin-3 levels remained an independent predictor of POD after controlling for different variables (P < 0.001). Elevated plasma galectin-3 levels are associated with an increased risk of POD. Plasma galectin-3 may be a prospective biomarker for predicting POD."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection is a rare but life-threatening syndrome, being accompanied by a mortality rate of 1%-2% per hour after the onset of symptoms if they remain untreated. The definitive therapy for type A acute aortic dissection is considered to be emergency surgery. However, the optimal method for aortic root reconstruction has been a controversial issue. This study presents three cases of acute thoracic aortic dissection (TAD) accompanied by complicated aortic root anatomy. These critical conditions were managed successfully with the Cabrol procedure. In this procedure, the coronary ostia are anastomosed to a second graft in an end-to-end fashion, which is then connected side to side with the ascending aorta. A 2-year follow-up of patients showed they had no new signs or symptoms or reemergence of them during this period. Follow-up transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the aorta showed no evidence of obstruction or complications of Cabrol and aortocoronary anastomosis. Although the modified Bentall procedure using coronary ostial aortic \"buttons\" may produce superior results and currently represents the standard of care for aortic root reconstruction, the Cabrol procedure can be considered a clinically valuable rescue procedure in patients whose management becomes more complicated due to anatomic difficulties."

    "abstract": "A Stanford type A aortic dissection is associated with elevated preoperative mortality and morbidity rates, as well as an increased likelihood of postoperative complications. Among these complications, paraplegia represents a serious but rare occurrence that can lead to significant morbidity in affected individuals. A 55-year-old male patient experienced acute paraplegia in the postoperative period after Stanford type A aortic dissection. Upon detection of paraplegia, medical therapy was promptly initiated. Despite maintenance of hemodynamic stability following surgery, the patient's neurological deficit persisted at 24 h postoperatively. In response, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage was performed. Notably, a full clinical recovery in neurological function was observed within 5 h of initiating CSF drainage. The pathophysiology underlying postoperative paraplegia in the context of aortic dissection remains unclear. However, with the maintenance of hemodynamic stability, appropriate medical management, and the persistence of neurological symptoms, the implementation of CSF drainage may be considered to facilitate resolution of symptoms. Emergent aortic surgeries can lead to devastating neurological complications. Among these complications, paraplegia can be managed successfully and considered a potentially reversible condition with these interventions."

    "abstract": "The study aimed to assess the posterior pericardial windows technique in the management of pericardial effusion following cardiac surgery. This single-center study examined the data of 1,752 patients who underwent cardiac surgery from 2018 onwards, excluding those who had off-pump coronary artery bypass grafts or emergency surgeries for conditions such as type 1 aortic dissection or infective endocarditis. Of the included patients, a posterior pericardial window was created in 349. The posterior pericardial window was created using electrocautery before the implantation of prosthetic valves or distal anastomosis. No other procedural changes were made. Postoperative drainage rates were monitored. Drains were removed on the second day after surgery. Of the patients with a posterior pericardial window, eight (2.3%) required revision due to tamponade within the first two postoperative days, compared to 53 (3.7%) of the patients without a posterior pericardial window. Patients who required revision were discharged on average seven days later, while those who did not require revision were discharged after five days. The early detection and effective management of cardiac tamponade are crucial due to the potentially life-threatening outcomes. This study highlights the value of the posterior pericardial window technique in reducing complications associated with pericardial effusion following cardiac surgery. The findings support the need for further research to improve surgical approaches and enhance patient outcomes and safety."

Twenty-one patients (12 males, 9 females; 50.67±13.79 years) who underwent an elective button Bentall operation between 2020 and 2023 were included in the study. Patients who were pregnant or breastfeeding, those younger than 18 years of age, who underwent emergency operation, who had type 1 aortic dissection, and who underwent additional valve operations other than aortic valve, infective endocarditis, and reoperations were excluded. Ten (47.6%) patients had bicuspid aortic valve structure, and all patients had severe aortic valve insufficiency. Four (19%) patients required early revision surgery due to hemorrhage. No mortality was observed during the hospitalization period. The mean cross-clamp time was 87.33±16.77 min, and the mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 118.81±19.88 min. In our study, early in-hospital mortality was not observed and we believe that this difference may be due to the small number of patients. Nevertheless, button Bentall operation for ascending aortic aneurysm and valve insufficiency appears to be a safe surgical treatment method with short-term results."

Bedside ultrasound showed cessation of Doppler flow in the femoral artery, while ECG was normal. Aortic dissection was suspected, but lacking CT-scanner, MRI-scanner, or transesophageal ultrasound, the diagnosis could not be confirmed. The patient was treated symptomatically with thrombolysis for suspected femoral artery thrombosis. Overnight, the right leg regained color and pulses. The next day, weather circumstances allowed transfer to a secondary hospital, and CT-angiography showed a Type A aortic dissection extending from the aortic valve to both femoral arteries. Thrombolysis was stopped, and the patient was transferred and underwent surgery abroad at a specialized hospital. Despite 55-hour delay, the patient had a favorable outcome, returning to work 8 weeks post-surgery. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges in remote settings."

Retrospective review of data collected prospectively in a single center. A tertiary referral hospital. A total of 605 patients who underwent cardiovascular surgery with CPB, excluding emergency aortic dissection cases. Cardiac valve and aortic surgeries were performed. HR was defined as an activated clotting time of less than 450 seconds measured after initial heparin administration (3 mg/kg) prior to CPB. Among the 605 patients, 164 were categorized into the HR group. Multivariable analysis revealed that patients with an active infection who underwent surgery had a significantly higher risk of developing HR (odds ratio [OR]: 2.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.25-4.21, p = 0.007). Compared with isolated valve surgery, isolated aortic surgery was associated with a higher risk of HR (OR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.12-2.71, p = 0.014). Preoperative antithrombin activity did not show a significant association with HR (OR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.98-1.01, p = 0.786). The incidence of major composite complications was significantly higher in the heparin-resistant group (33/164, 20.1%) compared with the non-heparin-resistant group (55/441, 12.5%, p = 0.025). However, no clear differences were observed in the incidence of individual complications. An active infection and aortic surgery were identified as risk factors for HR. Antithrombin deficiency was not a significant risk factor for HR in cardiovascular surgery; thus, preoperative antithrombin supplementation for the prevention of HR may not be necessary."

To determine the association of ED undertriage with delays in care for patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), aortic dissection (AD), and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). This retrospective cohort study included adult ED patients diagnosed with SAH, AD, or STEMI from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2020, from a multicenter, community-based health care delivery system. Data analysis were completed in March 2023 to October 2024. Undertriage vs correct triage, defined by operational measures of mistriage. Using a lognormal distribution, the outcomes of interest for patients with SAH and AD were adjusted median time to noncontrast computed tomography (CT) (head CT for patients with SAH, chest CT for patients with AD), antihypertensive medication orders (SAH), and β-blocker orders (AD), and ED length of stay (LOS). For patients with STEMI, outcomes of interest were adjusted median time to electrocardiogram (ECG) and troponin orders. A total of 5929 patients (median [IQR] age, 63.0 [54.0 to 73.0] years; 3876 [65.4%] male) were identified, including 915 with SAH, 480 with AD, and 4534 with STEMI. There were 1129 Asian patients (19.0%), 553 Black patients (9.3%), 889 Hispanic patients (15.0%), and 2906 non-Hispanic White patients (49.0%). Overall, 2175 patients (36.7%) were undertriaged. For patients with SAH, the lognormal estimate for delay in time to head CT was 0.2 (95% CI, 0.0-0.3), or a delay of 2.4 minutes, and for antihypertensive orders, the lognormal estimate was 4.8 (95% CI, 3.6-5.9), or a delay of 33.3 minutes; the lognormal estimate for ED LOS was 0.1 (95% CI, 0.0-0.1), or 7.7 minutes longer. For patients with AD, the lognormal estimate for delays were 0.2 (95% CI, 0.0-0.4), or 8.9 minutes, for chest CT and 0.5 (95% CI, 0.2-0.7), or 17.6 minutes, for β-blocker orders, and ED LOS was 0.2 (95% CI, 0.1-0.3), or 64 minutes longer. For patients with STEMI, differences in time to ECG and troponin orders were not statistically significant, at less than 1 minute, comparing correctly and undertriaged patients. In this cohort study of patients diagnosed with SAH, AD, or STEMI, ED undertriage was associated with small but significant delays in key diagnostic and therapeutic orders for patients with SAH and AD but not for patients with STEMI."

    "abstract": "Type A aortic dissection repair is an emergency operation associated with both higher perioperative and postoperative risk. This study investigates the influence of socioeconomic status, as measured by the Distressed Communities Index (DCI), on patients who underwent acute aortic dissection repair and their postoperative outcomes. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 240 adult patients who underwent repair for acute Stanford Type A aortic dissection from 2009 to 2021. Patients were categorized into an at-risk group (DCI score ≥75) and a not-at-risk group (DCI score <75) based on their zip code. We collected demographic, clinical, operative, and postoperative outcomes, analyzing data using descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis assessed 5-year survival outcomes. At-risk patients were significantly younger (52 vs 59 years; P = .03) and more commonly African American (59.02% vs 26.5%; P < .0001). Although chronic health condition rates were similar, at-risk patients showed trends toward higher rates of postoperative respiratory failure (27.1% vs 18.0%; P = .0926) and longer hospital stays (27.05% vs 15.25% for length of stay of 8-13 days; P = .065). However, rates of postoperative complications, including 30-day mortality and 5-year survival, were not significantly different between groups, and at-risk status did not significantly predict mortality (hazard ratio, 1.35; 95% CI, 0.65-2.79; P = .43). Patients undergoing urgent surgery for acute Type A aortic dissection have similar postoperative outcomes, although at-risk patients may experience longer hospital stays and higher respiratory failure rates. Further study is necessary to understand the effect of DCI score on intermediate and long-term outcomes to mitigate social disparities and diminish modifiable risk factors."

This study investigates the factors contributing to the misdiagnosis of AD and proposes strategies for improving its early diagnosis. A retrospective analysis of 801 patients with AD identified 219 cases for inclusion, which were split into a training set (131 cases) and a validation set (88 cases). A binary logistic regression model was used to identify factors influencing misdiagnosis, while a Nomogram prediction model was developed. The analysis revealed that factors such as the timing and suddenness of symptom onset, typical back pain, walk-in clinic visits, and laboratory results (D-dimer, fibrinogen, and white blood count) were significant in predicting misdiagnosis. The Nomogram model showed high predictive accuracy with an Area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.924 in the training set and 0.912 in the validation set, demonstrating good sensitivity and specificity. The model offers potential for improving diagnostic accuracy and clinical outcomes in AD cases."

Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a significant impact on surgery globally. The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on ATAAD patients undergoing surgical repair remains undetermined. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing ATAAD patients undergoing aortic surgery before versus during the COVID-19 pandemic and literature review of published cases reporting COVID-19 patients undergoing surgical repair for ATAAD. PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP, WANFANG, and SinoMed databases were searched for relevant studies and case reports till January 21st, 2023, and the database search was updated on January 3rd, 2024. Meta-analysis was performed by utilizing RevMan. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated for dichotomous data, and weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% CI for continuous data, respectively. All P-values were 2-sided and statistical significance was defined as P < .05. Meta-analysis of 5 included studies comparing ATAAD patients undergoing aortic surgery before versus during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that, the patients in Group During-Pandemic (DP) were older than those in Group Before-Pandemic (BP; P = .005), and the body mass index of the patients in Group DP was lower than that of the patients in Group BP (P = .002), more patients in Group DP were smokers (P = .02). Meta-analysis also showed that, either the composite incidence of mortality and morbidities or individual morbidity was comparable between 2 groups, except that more patients in Group DP developed pneumonia (P = .05). Literature reviews of 24 published cases reporting COVID-19 patients undergoing surgical repair for ATAAD demonstrated that, twenty (83.3%) patients recovered well after aortic surgery and were finally discharged from hospital. Unfortunately, 4 patients died postoperatively, 3 due to multiple organ failure and one due to respiratory failure (RF). Reported postoperative complications included hypoxia, endotracheal re-intubation, RF, renal failure, coagulopathy, fever, multi-organ failure and shock. The hospitalized outcomes of ATAAD patients undergoing surgical repair before versus during the COVID-19 were mostly comparable. ATAAD patients with concomitant COVID-19 infection who underwent emergent surgical repair had a high risk of mortality and morbidities."

    "abstract": "Isolated abdominal aortic dissection is a rare but potentially fatal condition. Timely diagnosis and management are crucial to reduce mortality and possible complications. Though computed tomography (CT) is the diagnostic imaging modality of choice, point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) holds certain promises in diagnosing aortic dissection. PoCUS is readily available at the bedside, has high specificity and sensitivity, and is useful, especially in unstable cases or when advanced imaging access is limited or time-consuming. PoCUS can also aid in risk stratification and assist in clinical decision-making when the likelihood of diagnosis is low. We describe a case of a 56-year-old patient who was referred to us with suspected abdominal aortic dissection, initially identified on an outpatient ultrasound. PoCUS performed in the emergency department (ED) revealed findings inconsistent with an intimal flap but more suggestive of a retained foreign body. The diagnosis was subsequently confirmed by a CT scan, which demonstrated a retained guidewire inadvertently left in place during a coronary intervention performed a decade earlier."

Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 80 (CCDC80) plays an essential role in regulating cardiovascular remodeling. This study aims to define the role of CCDC80 in the formation and development of AD. Significant downregulation of CCDC80 in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) in human and mouse AD is identified. Then, CCDC80 knockout mice (CCDC80-/-) and VSMC-specific CCDC80 knockout mice (CCDC80fl/fl SM22α Cre+) treated with angiotensin II (Ang II) or Ang II combined with β-aminopropionitrile monofumarate (BAPN) frequently develop AD with higher frequency and severity, accompanied by severe elastin fragmentation and collagen deposition. Mechanistically, CCDC80 interacts with JAK2, and CCDC80 deficiency promotes VSMC phenotype switching, proliferation, and migration as well as matrix metalloproteinase production by activating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Moreover, the JAK2/STAT3 pathway-specific inhibitor ameliorates adverse vascular remodeling and reduces AD formation in CCDC80-knockout mice by mitigating VSMC phenotype switching. In conclusion, CCDC80 deficiency exacerbates the progression of events leading to AD by activating the JAK2/STAT3 pathway involved in regulating the phenotype switching and function of VSMCs. These findings highlight that CCDC80 is a potential key target for the prevention and treatment of AD."

    "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the value of serum microRNA (miRNA) levels in the early diagnosis of acute aortic dissection (AAD). Methods: (1) Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were transfected with hsa-miR-744-5p mimic and its negative control mimic, and cell proliferation and migration were assessed using the CCK-8 assay and wound healing assay. (2) A total of 40 patients diagnosed with AAD by whole-aorta CT angiography in the Emergency Department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University from January 2020 to January 2022 were enrolled as the AAD group. The time interval between chest pain onset and blood sample collection was less than 24 hours. Meanwhile, 40 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals undergoing routine physical examinations were selected as the control group. The initial blood samples were collected from AAD patients upon admission, while fasting blood samples were collected from the control group. Based on our previous research findings, the top 10 miRNAs with the highest fold-change (>1) and the most significant upregulation were identified. Through a literature review, three miRNAs (miR-206, miR-143-3p, and miR-744-5p) were selected as target miRNAs. Laboratory test results, including D-dimer levels, were collected from both groups. The relative expression levels of target miRNAs in both groups were measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Spearman correlation analysis was performed to assess the correlation of target miRNA expression levels. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to calculate the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy. Results: (1) The CCK-8 assay showed that compared with HUVEC transfected with negative control mimic, HUVEC transfected with hsa-miR-744-5p exhibited lower absorbance values at all time points (all P<0.05). The wound healing assay indicated that the relative migration rate of HUVEC transfected with hsa-miR-744-5p mimic was significantly lower (P<0.05). (2) The D-dimer level significantly differed between the AAD group and the control group (1 737.0 (660.5, 3 297.5) μg/L vs. 66.0 (34.0, 89.0) μg/L, P<0.001). The expression levels of all three miRNA in the serum of AAD patients were significantly upregulated compared with the control group by qRT-PCR (all P<0.05). Spearman correlation analysis revealed positive correlations between miR-206 and miR-744-5p (r=0.508, P<0.001), miR-143-3p and miR-744-5p (r=0.695, P<0.001), and miR-206 and miR-143-3p (r=0.651, P<0.001). All three miRNAs had diagnostic value for AAD in ROC analysis, with miR-206 demonstrating the highest diagnostic accuracy (67.50%) and a specificity of 92.5%. The combined detection of miRNA improved diagnostic accuracy, with miR-206+miR-143-3p achieving an accuracy of 71.25%, specificity of 100%, and positive predictive value of 100%. The combination of miRNA with D-dimer further enhanced diagnostic accuracy, with miR-206+miR-744-5p+D-dimer achieving the highest accuracy (97.50%), along with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value all at 97.5%. The diagnostic performance of miR-206+miR-143-3p+miR-744-5p+D-dimer was identical to that of miR-206+miR-744-5p+D-dimer. Conclusion: miR-206, miR-143-3p, and miR-744-5p show great potential for the early diagnosis of acute aortic dissection, and their combination with D-dimer can significantly improve diagnostic sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. 目的： 探讨血清微小RNA（miRNA）水平对早期诊断急性主动脉夹层的价值。 方法： （1）使用hsa-miR-744-5p模拟体及其阴性对照模拟体分别转染人脐静脉内皮细胞（HUVEC），采用CCK-8实验及细胞划痕实验检测细胞的增殖和迁移情况。（2）纳入2020年1月至2022年1月就诊于新疆医科大学第一附属医院急诊科经全主动脉CT血管成像明确诊断为急性主动脉夹层的患者40例，作为急性主动脉夹层组，纳入患者从胸痛发作到血样采集间隔时间≤24 h。同时选取年龄、性别与之匹配的体检健康者40例为对照组。采集急性主动脉夹层组患者入院后的第1批血液样本，对照组取空腹血样。在本团队既往研究结果基础上，筛选出差异倍数>1且表达水平上调排名前10的miRNA，随后通过查阅文献，选择了3种miRNA（miR-206、miR-143-3p、miR-744-5p）作为目标miRNA。收集两组的D-二聚体检验结果，采用荧光定量聚合酶链式反应（qRT-PCR）检测两组中目标miRNA的相对表达水平。使用Spearman相关分析评估目标miRNA表达量的相关性。绘制受试者工作特征曲线，计算灵敏度、特异度、阳性预测值、阴性预测值、诊断准确度。 结果： （1）CCK-8检测结果提示，与转染阴性对照模拟体的HUVEC比较，转染hsa-miR-744-5p模拟体的HUVEC在不同培养时间点的吸光度值均更低（P均<0.05）；划痕实验表明，其相对迁移率更低（P均<0.05）。（2）急性主动脉夹层组与对照组的D-二聚体水平差异有统计学意义［1 737.0（660.5，3 297.5）μg/L比66.0（34.0，89.0）μg/L，P<0.001］。qRT-PCR检测结果显示，与对照组相比，急性主动脉夹层组患者血清中3种miRNA表达水平均上调（P均<0.05）。Spearman相关分析显示，miR-206与miR-744-5p（r=0.508，P<0.001）、miR-143-3p与miR-744-5p（r=0.695，P<0.001）、miR-206与miR-143-3p（r=0.651，P<0.001）呈正相关。受试者工作特征曲线显示，3种miRNA对急性主动脉夹层均具有诊断效能，其中miR-206的诊断准确度最高（67.50%），特异度为92.5%。miRNA之间联合检测可提高诊断准确度，其中miR-206+miR-143-3p诊断准确度71.25%，特异度100%，阳性预测值100%。miRNA联合D-二聚体后诊断准确度大幅度提升，其中miR-206+miR-744-5p+D-二聚体诊断准确度最高（97.50%），灵敏度、特异度、阳性预测值、阴性预测值均为97.5%。miR-206+miR-143-3p+miR-744-5p+D-二聚体联合诊断效能与miR-206+miR-744-5p+D-二聚体相同。 结论： miR-206、miR-143-3p和miR-744-5p在早期诊断急性主动脉夹层方面具有较大潜力，联合D-二聚体可显著提高诊断的灵敏度、特异度和准确度。."

During valve deployment, catheter manipulation caused intimal disruption, leading to acute type A aortic dissection (TAAD). Remarkably, the dissection spontaneously sealed after prosthetic valve placement, thereby avoiding emergency surgery. A 6-month follow-up computed tomography angiography scan showed no extension of the dissection. In the case we report, the dissection spontaneously sealed with the use of a prosthetic valve, a finding that reinforces the feasibility of nonsurgical management of iatrogenic TAAD during TAVR in select cases. The use of a biological valve offers a novel perspective on the conservative management of iatrogenic aortic dissection in high-risk patients during TAVR."

    "abstract": "Mitral valve replacement, or any major cardiac surgery, is usually delayed for a minimum of 6 weeks after a previous stroke, mainly to avoid recurrence, if not associated with infective endocarditis or aortic dissection. A 50-year-old lady, diagnosed with severe mitral stenosis with a large left atrial clot, had a sudden onset cerebrovascular accident (CVA) while awaiting surgery. Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) of large vessel M1 middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion was done, and after adequate neurological improvement, she was taken up for emergency mitral valve replacement within 12 h, because of hemodynamic instability leading to low cardiac output syndrome and to avoid the chance of future CVA due to large clot burden. A 23-mm mechanical mitral valve prosthesis was implanted, and the postoperative course was uneventful. She was discharged on the fifth postoperative day, with stable hemodynamics and no residual neurological deficit. She was asymptomatic with normal echocardiographic findings on 12 months' follow-up. Major cardiac surgery after MT for ischemic CVA may be a viable option, if indicated, provided post-MT neurological improvement is adequate."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection during pregnancy is a relatively rare but often life-threatening conditio. A previous study showed that the overall incidence of the disease was about 4 in 1 million women aged 15-45 years. Hormonal and Hemodynamics changes during pregnancy are a major cause of aortic dissection, and these changes may begin in the first and second trimesters, but are most pronounced in the third trimesters(about 50% and 33%, respectively).In addition, some genetic disorder such as Marfan syndrome may be associated with AD during pregnancy. A 29-year-old pregnant woman at 21 weeks of gestation presented with acute, non-radiating retrosternal tearing pain lasting 15 h, unrelieved and accompanied by three episodes of vomiting. Ultrasonography identified aortic root dilatation with aortic regurgitation, and contrast-enhanced aortic computed tomography (CT) confirmed type A aortic dissection (AD). Emergency surgery was performed, including ascending aortic replacement, total arch replacement with prosthetic graft placement, stented elephant trunk implantation (Sun's procedure), and aortic valvuloplasty under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The patient was discharged on postoperative day (POD) 9, and the fetus remained viable. At 26 weeks of gestation, the family expressed concerns regarding maternal safety, prompting an early request for cesarean delivery due to cervical insufficiency and preeclampsia, resulting in the delivery of a healthy infant with no adverse events. Although AD during pregnancy is uncommon, clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for pregnant women presenting with severe chest pain. CTA is essential for diagnosing the condition and determining surgical options. After 28 weeks of pregnancy, cesarean section should be prioritized [17-18]. In the early second trimester, ensuring fetal safety involves appropriately increasing mean arterial pressure, minimizing circulatory arrest time, and closely monitoring the fetus post-surgery."

    "abstract": "Anemia can worsen the prognosis of patients with acute cardiovascular (CV) disease; however, the effect of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion on mid-term outcomes in such patients requiring intensive care remains unclear. Therefore, this study investigated the association between RBC transfusions during hospitalization and subsequent CV events (all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke, admission for acute heart failure [AHF], unstable angina, and other CV events) after hospital discharge in patients admitted to the cardiovascular intensive care unit (CICU). We retrospectively enrolled 517 patients with emergent admission to the CICU for suspected acute CV disease between January and December 2018. After excluding 41 patients who died or developed CV events during hospitalization, the remaining 476 patients (44.3% with acute coronary syndrome, 22.1% with heart failure, 6.7% with acute aortic dissection, 16.0% with other cardiac diseases, and 10.9% with non-cardiac diseases) were included in the analysis and divided into transfusion (n = 111) and non-transfusion (n = 365) groups based on RBC transfusion requirements during hospitalization. All patients were followed up for subsequent CV events over a period of 180 days after hospital discharge. Compared with the non-transfusion group, the transfusion group showed a higher incidence of chronic kidney disease (73.9% vs. 48.2%, p < 0.001), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (18.0 ± 7.2 vs. 13.9 ± 5.6, p < 0.001), frequency of use of invasive mechanical support devices (52.3% vs. 13.7%, p < 0.001), and surgery rate (35.1% vs. 3.3%, p < 0.001), as well as a lower nadir hemoglobin level (8.9 ± 2.3 g/dL vs. 11.7 ± 1.9 g/dL, p < 0.001). The cumulative incidence of CV events was higher in the transfusion group than in the non-transfusion group (32.9% vs. 9.1%, log-rank p < 0.001), with a similar trend observed even after propensity score matching (29.2% vs. 12.3%, log-rank p = 0.049). RBC transfusion remained independently associated with subsequent CV events after adjusting for age, sex, nadir hemoglobin level, bleeding complications, and CV risk factors (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-5.46; p = 0.027). These findings suggest that RBC transfusion during hospitalization is independently associated with subsequent CV events in patients admitted to the CICU, indicating the need for cautious evaluation of transfusion practices based on potential long-term adverse effects."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection is a fatal condition that presents with arch vessel dissection necessitating emergency surgical intervention and reconstruction. During surgical treatment of acute type A aortic dissection, thorough analysis is required to prevent complications while reconstructing these fragile dissected arch vessels. This study describes the surgical treatment of 8 patients with dissected arch vessels who underwent reinforcement technique for anastomosis mediated by Hydrofit® (Sanyo Chemical Industries, Kyoto, Japan). The arch vessels were anastomosed with a prosthetic graft. Following the application of Hydrofit to the suture line on the adventitia, no intraoperative bleeding was detected at the reconstruction site of the dissected arch vessels. Postoperative computed tomography revealed no new anastomotic tear or pseudoaneurysm. We highly recommend the use of this reinforcement technique with Hydrofit for the management and reconstruction of vessels involved in acute type A aortic dissection. We observed a fast and uneventful recovery, suggesting promising postoperative results."

    "abstract": "Acute Stanford type A aortic dissection (TAAD) is a surgical emergency characterized by a high mortality rate and numerous complications. In the treatment of TAAD, the timing of surgery and the choice of surgical procedure are of paramount importance. Open total aortic arch reconstruction remains the gold standard for aortic arch surgery and is one of the most challenging procedures. However, this approach is invasive, relatively lengthy, and associated with substantial bleeding, which necessitates high levels of operator skill and carries the risk of multiple complications, particularly neurological ones. This report describes a novel hybrid procedure named Open Ascending Aorta Replacement Combined with Fenestrated Total Aortic Arch Stenting. A case was selected in which the lesion did not involve the aortic arch, at least on the greater curvature side of the arch. Ascending aortic replacement was performed, followed by arch intervention with self-modified stent grafts to preserve the aortic arch native branches. This approach allows for a rapid simplification of the procedure, avoids deep hypothermia or circulatory arrest associated with conventional open surgery, and mitigates neurological complications."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection represents a critical cardiac surgical emergency and carries a significant mortality risk. While computed tomography angiography is the standard for initial diagnosis, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is indispensable in the intraoperative setting. This article discusses intraoperative TEE findings in patients undergoing surgery for type A aortic dissection, emphasizing the necessity of real-time imaging to detect complications and guide surgical management. The use of TEE is important in confirming diagnoses, monitoring hemodynamics, evaluating the function of the aortic valve, pericardial, and pleural spaces, and potentially assessing abdominal branch vessel flow, thus ultimately facilitating informed surgical decisions. Moreover, intraoperative TEE use enables differentiation between true and false lumens and facilitates central aortic cannulation guidance via the Seldinger technique. Post-cardiopulmonary bypass, TEE is used to assess surgical results and guide further interventions if necessary. This comprehensive review aims to disseminate essential echocardiographic insights, advocating for greater awareness and utilization of TEE in the surgical management of aortic dissection to improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Acute chest pain is a common concern for which patients present to the emergency department. Nonetheless, many patients with acute chest pain indicative of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) show nonobstructed coronary arteries at invasive coronary angiography or coronary CT angiography (CCTA), which is a clinical conundrum in day-to-day practice. Guidelines recommend that the initial course of action for patients experiencing acute chest pain is to exclude extracardiac and cardiac conditions that could cause nonischemic myocardial damage, including aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, or septic shock. The generic term troponin-positive with nonobstructed coronary arteries (TpNOCA) was coined to refer to patients with nonobstructed coronary arteries who present with clinical symptoms and signs of ACS and increased cardiac troponin levels, electrocardiographic changes, or both. The causes of TpNOCA may be ischemic (eg, myocardial infarction with nonobstructed coronary arteries [MINOCA] or ischemia with nonobstructed coronary arteries [INOCA]) or nonischemic (eg, extracardiac and cardiac entities). MINOCA and INOCA are working diagnostic terms used until a definitive cause is established (eg, coronary plaque rupture, coronary artery dissection, or coronary microvascular disease). Noninvasive cardiac imaging techniques, notably CCTA and cardiac MRI, and ischemia testing are pivotal in evaluating and treating these patients through accurate identification of the underlying cause, improvement in risk stratification, and guidance for clinicians in decision making for treatment and follow-up. ©RSNA, 2025."

We report the case of a 35-year-old woman (gravida 7 para 6) at 34 weeks of gestation who presented with epigastric pain, initially suspected to be gastroenteritis. Despite stable initial findings, her condition deteriorated and a CT angiogram confirmed the diagnosis of DeBakey Type I aortic dissection, which extended from the aortic root to the iliac arteries. She underwent an emergency cesarean section followed by a Bentall procedure, a surgical technique first described by Bentall and De Bono in 1968 to manage the aortic valve, root, and ascending aorta abnormalities. Both mother and baby survived, with an uneventful recovery. However, this case highlights the diagnostic challenges of aortic dissection in pregnancy, as non-specific symptoms can mimic benign conditions.

Computed tomography taken during 5 weeks of hospitalization incidentally revealed an anomalous single coronary artery arising from the left sinus of Valsalva, and the right coronary artery orifice was absent. One month after being transferred to another institution for rehabilitation, she was reintroduced to us for re-dissection of the aorta. An urgent operation involving aortic arch replacement was performed. There was a solitary coronary artery orifice at the left sinus of Valsalva and no ostium at the right sinus. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged 14 days after the surgery.

    "abstract": "Background: Cerebral protection during aortic surgery is crucial for improving surgical outcomes and reducing neurological complications. Selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (SACP) is increasingly used, and innominate artery (IA) side graft cannulation presents an innovative alternative to conventional axillary artery cannulation, with the potential to reduce complications associated with the latter. Methods: In this retrospective study, 196 patients who underwent proximal aortic surgery with IA graft cannulation for SACP between January 2021 and June 2024 were analyzed. Demographic data, intraoperative parameters, and postoperative outcomes were evaluated. Complications such as new stroke, postoperative delirium, mortality, and acute renal failure (ARF) were assessed. Results: The median age of the patients was 63 years, and 18.37% underwent emergency surgery for Type A acute aortic dissection (TAAAD). The most frequently performed surgical procedure was ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement (36.74%). The median cardiopulmonary bypass, cross-clamp, and SACP durations were 120.5, 93, and 23 min, respectively. The postoperative mortality rate was 3.06%, stroke rate was 2.04%, delirium rate was 9.18%, and ARF rate was 3.06%. All cases of delirium resolved spontaneously within 2-3 days. The mortality rate among Marfan syndrome (MFS) patients was 4.35%, with no reported stroke cases in this group. Conclusions: IA graft cannulation is a safe and effective method for providing SACP in aortic surgery, particularly in high-risk patient groups such as those with TAAAD and MFS. This technique ensures optimal cerebral perfusion, minimizes neurological and systemic complications, and enhances surgical efficiency by reducing operative duration. However, large-scale, multicenter, and prospective studies are needed to evaluate its long-term efficacy and safety."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a critical cardiovascular emergency marked by the rupture of the aortic intima, resulting in blood infiltration into the media and the formation of a false lumen. AAD incidence varies by area, emphasizing the need for better diagnostics and epidemiological investigations. Bucharest University Emergency Hospital's Emergency Department conducted this retrospective cohort analysis from May 2021 to May 2023. We examined 26 Stanford Type A aortic dissection patients to establish in-hospital mortality and one-year survival rates. The primary objective was to analyze demographic, clinical, and paraclinical factors and their impact on patient outcomes. A total of 57.7% of the study group was male and had a mean age of 58.2 years, and 69.2% of patients had hypertension, indicating its importance as a risk factor. Acute chest discomfort was reported by 53.8%, neurological problems by 30.8%, and syncope or hypotension by 42.3%. CT angiography and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) confirmed the diagnosis and assessed dissection severity. Pericardial effusion (19.2%) and moderate to severe aortic regurgitation (26.9%) were notable. Management varied by dissection intensity and location. Emergency surgery was performed in 61.5% of patients within 24 h of diagnosis, resulting in a 12.5% in-hospital death rate. Conservatively managed patients had a 60.0% in-hospital death rate. Timely intervention is crucial, since the surgical cohort had an 87.5% one-year survival rate compared to 30% for the conservatively managed cohort. Acute renal damage (25%), protracted mechanical ventilation (31.3%), and advanced supportive care infections were postoperative sequelae. Conservative care exacerbated visceral ischemia (20%) and heart failure (10%). Advanced age and hypotension upon admission were independent mortality predictors, emphasizing the need for early risk assessment and personalized treatment. Multimodal imaging, timely surgical referral, and excellent postoperative care improve AAD outcomes, according to this study."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic intramural hematoma (IMH) is a relatively uncommon but potentially life-threatening aortic disease that can occur primarily in hypertensive and atherosclerotic patients. The course of IMH varies widely, with the condition either regressing, remaining stable, or progressing until it leads to outward rupture or intimal layer disruption, eventually resulting in overt aortic dissection. Therefore, poor prognostic computed tomography (CT) features must be promptly recognized and reported by the radiologist. In emergency departments, readily accessible non-invasive CT angiography is crucial for achieving a rapid and accurate diagnosis essential for appropriate management. For Type A and B aortic dissection, surgery is typically recommended in Western countries for patients with Stanford Type A IMH and those experiencing irrepressible pain. For Stanford Type B IMH patients without complications or incessant pain, medical treatment is suggested but with imaging follow-up. In complicated Stanford Type B situations, thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is currently indicated. This review aims to present pathophysiology, CT diagnosis, and IMH fate and provide the reader CT image-based review of the CT diagnostic criteria, complications, and associated critical prognostic findings of this rather rare aortic disease."

    "abstract": "Pericardiocentesis is both therapeutic and diagnostic invasive procedure, guided by echocardiography and/or angiography. It can be done using subcostal or apical approach. One of the major complications of pericardiocentesis is coronary artery laceration with an incidence of less than 1%. Diagnosis of such lacerations is often made by invasive coronary angiography or urgent thoracotomy. Computed tomography angiography is used to determine the extent of bleeding and hemopericardium, but its potential for detailed evaluation of bleeding site is somewhat underestimated. We present a rare case of distal obtuse marginal (OM) artery perforation resulting from apical pericardiocentesis that was diagnosed with CT angiography (CTA) further treated with coronary guidewire particle embolization. A 49-year-old male patient who had undergone ascending aorta and aortic arch reconstruction after an aortic dissection Type A was evaluated with echocardiography before being discharged from our hospital. A loculated pericardial effusion was identified, necessitating pericardiocentesis. The clinical course was further complicated by hemopericardium due to coronary laceration. The hemorrhage was managed with coronary guidewire segment embolization which led to immediate improvement in hemodynamic status. The patient was discharged seven days after intervention. Coronary artery perforation is a rare, albeit life-threatening complication of pericardiocentesis that requires urgent surgical or percutaneous intervention. CTA can provide important diagnostic information on perforation location and help in deciding whether embolization or open-heart surgery is needed to address ongoing bleeding."

This study investigates laboratory markers that may support the diagnostic process and predict surgical outcomes and mortality in AAD patients. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study analyzed data from 85 patients diagnosed with AAD in an emergency setting. Patients over 18 years of age with a diagnosis of acute dissection were included. Key laboratory and clinical parameters were examined to determine their association with mortality and the likelihood of surgical intervention. Results: The study found that younger patients were more likely to undergo surgery, while parameters such as white blood cells (WBCs), neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts were elevated in those undergoing surgery. Mortality predictors included elevated mean platelet volume (MPV), low pH, bicarbonate (HCO3), and base deficit levels. Each unit increase in MPV was associated with a threefold increase in mortality risk, and DeBakey Type 1 patients exhibited the highest MPV levels. Discussion: WBC and MPV values were linked with surgical and mortality outcomes, respectively. Blood gas analysis parameters, particularly HCO3 and base deficit levels, were significant mortality predictors, underscoring the importance of metabolic markers in AAD assessment. The findings suggest that incorporating these laboratory parameters into diagnostic and treatment decisions could improve AAD management."

However, few studies have reported the association between PP and adverse events during hospitalization in patients with type A acute aortic dissection (TAAAD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between admission PP and in-hospital all-cause mortality, in patients with TAAAD of relatively stable patients. Patients with TAAAD of relatively stable patients admitted from January 2015 to December 2021 were included and divided into four groups according to the PP values measured at the time of admission: reduced group (PP ≤ 40 mmHg), normal group (40 < PP ≤ 56 mmHg), mildly elevated group (56 < PP ≤ 75 mmHg), and significantly elevated group (PP > 75 mmHg). A multivariate binary logistic regression model was constructed, plotted using nomogram and evaluated with ROC curve. Admission PP and in-hospital all-cause mortality showed a \"J-curve\" correlation and in-hospital all-cause mortality was significantly higher in the significantly elevated group and reduced group (P = 0.002), respectively. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis showed that significantly elevated PP (PP > 75 mmHg) (P < 0.001) and reduced PP (P = 0.043), D-dimer (P < 0.001), ascending aortic diameter (P = 0.037), Abdominal visceral vessels involved (P = 0.017), and coronary atherosclerosis (P = 0.003) and emergent surgery (P < 0.001) were independent predictive factors for in-hospital all-cause mortality. The AUC of ROC plotted was 0.827 (95% CI 0.774-0.880). Our findings demonstrated a \"J-curve\" association of admission PP with in-hospital all-cause mortality in TAAAD. Significantly elevated and reduced admission PP, D-dimer, ascending aortic diameter and coronary atherosclerosis were independent risk factors for in-hospital all-cause mortality in patients with TAAAD, and emergent surgery was a protective factor."

A 66-years old male presented with sudden chest pain, dyspnoea and nausea. Electrocardiogram (ECG), point of care ultrasound (POCUS) of the heart and tripple rule out computed tomography (CT) were performed to differentiate the cause of acute chest pain. ECG showed no ischemia. POCUS of the heart showed aneurysmal ascending aorta (4,5 cm), suspected intimal flap, mild aortic regurgitation, minimal pericardial effusion, right heart dilatation with impaired function. CT confirmed TAAAD with extensive intramural hematoma around the central pulmonary arteries propagating to intrapulmonary branches. Additionally, there was dilatation of the right ventricle and right atrium indicative of right heart pressure overload along mild haemorrhagic pericardial effusion anterior to the right ventricle. No evidence of pulmonary embolism was found. Emergency surgery included the replacement of the supracoronary ascending aorta and aortic hemiarch. TAAAD is a rare but life-threatening cause of chest pain often mimicking other conditions such as pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary complications including intramural hematoma of the pulmonic trunk due to its shared adventitia with ascending aorta are rare but clinically significant, causing lumen reduction or occlusion of pulmonary arteries, leading to right heart pressure overload. Timely differentiation is critical as anticoagulation is contraindicated."

Consecutive female patients managed with custom made FB-Arch devices (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA) were eligible. Primary outcomes were technical success and death and stroke at 30 days. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were performed for follow up outcomes. The study included 148 females (mean age 71.8 ± 3.5 years; mean aortic diameter 61.9 ± 4.2 mm; 14.2% urgent; 5.4% ruptures). The aortic dissection rate was 38.5% (35.8% chronic; 2.7% acute). Distal FB-Arch was performed in 23%. B-Arch was used in 68.9% and F-Arch in 27.7%, while 3.4% were managed with a left subclavian artery branch device. The non-native proximal aortic landing (nNPAL) rate was 60.1%. Technical success was 95.9%.

    "abstract": "A 19-year-old female patient presented with an acute onset of substernal chest pain, accompanied by dyspnea and diaphoresis while walking to the gym. She was able to start her routine, but the pain worsened. She was taken to the emergency room, where an electrocardiogram was performed, and no irregularities were observed, while the troponin test was significantly elevated. Imaging studies, including a Doppler echocardiogram and an emergent CT of the chest to rule out aortic dissection, returned normal results. The pain subsided after two hours, but troponin kept increasing; consequently, spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) was suspected. In view of the young age of the patient, it was decided to refrain from performing a coronary angiogram, intravascular ultrasound, or optical coherence tomography. A CT coronary angiography scan did not show any anomaly. A cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed a clear subendocardial enhancement indicative of a myocardial infarction. A diagnosis of SCAD was confirmed, and no further testing was done. The patient was started on aspirin and beta-blockers, and advised to perform only minimal to moderate exercise and to consult a healthcare physician immediately if the episode recurs. CT angiogram ruled out fibrodysplasia of the renal arteries, and plasma metanephrines were normal. This case shows that with the advancement of noninvasive techniques, there is probably no need for invasive measures to diagnose SCAD in stable patients."

Misdiagnosis is common because of hidden symptoms, insufficient knowledge among pediatricians, and lack of consensus and guidelines. We aimed to report the clinical features of patients and enhance the diagnostic awareness of aortic dissection in children with acute chest pain or trauma, avoid delayed diagnosis and the subsequent worsening of clinical outcomes. We presented three cases of pediatric aortic dissection and summarized our findings from the literature. We treated a 13-year-old boy with Stanford Type A aortic dissection, a 9-year-old boy with Stanford Type B aortic dissection, and an 11-year-old boy with Stanford Type A aortic dissection. Two patients had spontaneous aortic lesions, one had a traumatic aortic lesion, and all three were discharged from our hospital after thoracotomy. We searched the Medline database using PubMed and platforms such as Springer Link and Google Scholar with the search terms \"aortic dissection\" and \"pediatric\" or \"children\". We retrieved 27 reports describing 34 cases of aortic dissection in patients aged ≤16 years published from 1990 to 2024 to summarize the characteristics of precipitating factors, aortic dissection status, and clinical presentations. The prognosis of children with aortic dissection after treatment is generally better than that of adults. In pediatric emergency settings, persistent chest pain that does not alleviate and cannot be attributed to common illnesses warrants heightened suspicion of aortic dissection. Surgical treatment should be promptly performed once the condition is diagnosed."

    "title": "Perioperative dynamic changes of systemic inflammatory response, gut injury, and hypoxemia in patients with acute type-A aortic dissection: an observational case-control study.",
    "abstract": "The details regarding the pathogenesis of hypoxemia in the presence of acute type-A aortic dissection (ATAAD) remains to be fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the dynamic changes in systemic inflammatory response, gut injury, hypoxemia, and succinate levels in patients with ATAAD and their impact on perioperative hypoxemia. We conducted a single-center, observational, case-control study that enrolled 18 patients with ATAAD who underwent emergency total arch repair (TAR) combined with frozen elephant trunk (FET) procedure under hypothermic lower-body circulatory arrest and antegrade cerebral perfusion. White blood cell (WBC) count, interleukin (IL)6, IL8, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), diamine oxidase (DAO), intestinal fatty-acid-binding protein (iFABP), peptidoglycan (PGN), and succinate were assessed preoperatively and 12, 24, and 48 hours after operation. The PaO2/FiO2 ratios were evaluated preoperatively and 4, 8, and 12 hours after operation. These variables were compared between different time points. Correlation analyses and multivariate linear regression were performed to evaluate the variables' impact on 12-hour postoperative hypoxemia. Compared to controls, patients with ATAAD had a significantly higher preoperative WBC count [(12.18±4.50)×109/L vs. (3.73±1.05)×109/L; P<0.001], IL6 (129.31±12.86 vs. 114.22±14.11 pg/mL; P=0.002), IL8 (147.57±16.03 vs. 127.56±20.23 pg/mL; P=0.002), TNFα (59.29±6.90 vs. 40.51±7.53 pg/mL; P<0.001), DAO activity (17.94±1.54 vs. 13.32±1.82 U/L; P<0.001), and succinate (235.92±48.09 vs. 106.95±27.63 µM; P<0.001) but a lower PaO2/FiO2. In patients with ATAAD, postoperative levels of IL6, IL8, TNFα, DAO, iFABP, and PGN were significantly elevated compared to preoperative levels, while the PaO2/FiO2 ratio decreased significantly from the preoperative levels. Succinate levels peaked prior to the operation and remained elevated at both the 12- and 24-hour postoperative time points. PGN, iFABP, succinate, and lowest rectal temperature during cardiopulmonary bypass were the risk factors for hypoxemia at 12 hours' postoperation. Systemic inflammatory response, gut injury, and hypoxemia had already occurred preoperatively in patients with ATAAD and exacerbated postoperatively following TAR combined with FET procedure under hypothermic lower-body circulatory arrest and antegrade cerebral perfusion. Succinate may play a pivotal role in the development of hypoxemia in patients with ATAAD."

    "title": "Extent of surgical repair and outcomes after surgery for type A aortic dissection.",
    "abstract": "Acute Stanford type A aortic dissection is a severe emergency condition that, if left untreated, is associated with a high mortality rate. The extent of surgical repair may impact the outcomes of these patients. Patients operated for acute type A aortic dissection from a multicentre European registry were included. Patients were categorized based on the following types of surgical intervention: isolated ascending aortic replacement, ascending aortic replacement with concomitant aortic valve replacement, aortic root replacement, partial or total arch replacement, and partial or total arch replacement with concomitant aortic root replacement. The primary outcome was mortality rate, both in-hospital and at 10 years. Secondary outcomes were acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, neurological complications, a composite endpoint including in-hospital death, neurological complications and/or dialysis, and proximal endovascular or surgical aortic re-operations at 10 years. 3702 patients were included. The adjusted risk of in-hospital mortality was higher in all subsets of patients compared to those who underwent isolated ascending aortic replacement. The adjusted rates of in-hospital mortality ranged from 16.4% (95% c.i. 15.3 to 17.4) among patients who underwent isolated ascending aortic replacement to 27.7% (95% c.i. 23.3 to 31.2) among those who underwent aortic arch and concomitant aortic root replacement. The adjusted risks of neurological complications, renal replacement therapy and of the composite endpoint were significantly higher in patients who underwent partial/total aortic arch replacement. The adjusted risk estimates of 10-year mortality rate were markedly higher in patients who underwent partial/total aortic arch replacement with or without concomitant aortic root replacement. Extensive aortic repair did not significantly reduce the risk of distal or proximal aortic reoperations. These findings suggest that, when feasible, limiting the extent of aortic replacement for acute type A aortic dissection may be beneficial in reducing mortality rate and major complications both in the short and long term.

    "abstract": "To evaluate the differences in short- and mid-term outcomes for intramural hematoma in the type A distribution (TAIMH) and acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) patients treated at a single institution between 2000 and 2020 to provide insight into whether an emergent surgical treatment strategy for TAIMH is an acceptable treatment option. Between January 2000 and December 2020, a total of 903 patients were treated for acute aortic syndrome at Stanford Hospital. Baseline characteristics, operative details, short-term postoperative outcomes, mid-term survival, and reoperation rates were examined for this cohort. Cardinality matching was used to control for baseline characteristics and presentation symptoms. Fine balance matching was used to control for cannulation strategy. A total of 187 TAIMH patients were treated surgically and 27 were managed medically. The ATAAD arm included 642 patients who underwent surgery and 47 who were managed nonoperatively. ATAAD operative patients were more commonly male and younger compared to the TAIMH operative patients; however, other baseline medical history was similar in the 2 arms. ATAAD patients presented with higher rates of malperfusion and aortic regurgitation. Cross-clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass times were longer in the ATAAD arm, and these patients underwent more root replacements. Short-term postoperative outcomes were similar in the 2 arms, and there was no significant difference in unadjusted long-term survival and freedom from reoperation. With cardinality matching for preoperative history and presentation symptoms, mid-term survival was better for TAIMH patients. With fine balance matching for cannulation strategy, there was no significant difference between the groups in mid-term survival or stroke. In conclusion, a surgical management strategy for acute TAIMH results in excellent postoperative outcomes and supports an aggressive emergent operative strategy in aortic centers of excellence."

    "title": "Abrupt left coronary artery malperfusion secondary to acute type A aortic dissection after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass: a case report.",
    "abstract": "Acute Stanford type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a lethal emergency. However, even with instant surgical repair, early mortality is up to 20%. ATAAD complicated by coronary artery involvement is considered rare but life-threatening because this can cause coronary artery malperfusion which results in acute myocardial infarction. In particular, left coronary artery malperfusion can bring worse outcomes than right coronary artery malperfusion, but there are few reports of left coronary artery involvement secondary to ATAAD. We present a case of a woman who got emergency open heart surgery due to ATAAD. After the hemiarch replacement, the first weaning from bypass was relatively smooth. However, as soon as starting infusion protamine, we found out sudden regional wall motion abnormality at the diffuse anteroseptal to the lateral wall on echocardiography and ST depression on leads II and V5 electrocardiogram after several ventricular fibrillation. We recognized by echocardiography that intimal dissection flap extended to the left coronary artery ostium and dynamically obstructed left coronary artery blood flow, because the true lumen collapsed dynamically during the diastolic phase. Upon re-establishing bypass, proximal aortic false lumen was obliterated with BioGlue again. Smooth weaning from bypass proceeded at last. Finally, the blood flow to the left coronary artery ostium was good, and the wall motion abnormality was improved. Our report suggests the importance of the degree of myocardial damage caused by coronary artery malperfusion which is a major predictor of patient outcome. To reduce complications and minimize the mortality rate, an instant treatment plan is needed. However, limited options for exact surgical treatment directions or guidelines for coronary artery malperfusion secondary to ATAAD are available so far. We emphasize that we should not neglect any signs indicative of coronary artery malperfusion appear such as changes of electrocardiogram and echocardiography. Moreover, our report contributes to a profound understanding among clinicians regarding the necessity of practical treatment guidelines about coronary artery malperfusion due to ATAAD based on various surgical experiences and studies."

    "abstract": "Type-A aortic dissection (TAAD) is a cardiac emergency in which rapid diagnosis, prognosis prediction, and surgical planning are critical for patient survival. A comprehensive understanding of the anatomic structures and related features of TAAD patients is the key to completing these tasks. However, due to the emergent nature of this disease and requirement of advanced expertise, manual segmentation of these anatomic structures is not routinely available in clinical practice. Currently, automatic segmentation of TAAD is a focus of the cardiovascular imaging research. However, existing works have two limitations: no comprehensive public dataset and lack of clinically-oriented evaluation. To address these limitations, in this paper we propose imageTAAD, the first comprehensive segmentation dataset of TAAD with clinically-oriented evaluation. The dataset is comprised of 120 cases, and each case is annotated by medical experts with 35 foreground classes reflecting the clinical needs for diagnosis, prognosis prediction and surgical planning for TAAD. In addition, we have identified four key clinical features for clinically-oriented evaluation. We also propose SegTAAD, a baseline method for comprehensive segmentation of TAAD. SegTAAD utilizes two pieces of domain knowledge: (1) the boundaries play a key role in the evaluation of clinical features, and can enhance the segmentation performance, and (2) the tear is located between TL and FL. We have conducted intensive experiments with a variety of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, and experimental results have shown that our method achieves SOTA performance on the ImageTAAD dataset in terms of overall DSC score, 95% Hausdorff distance, and four clinical features. In our study, we also found an interesting phenomenon that a higher DSC score does not necessarily indicate better accuracy in clinical feature extraction. All the dataset, code and trained models have been published (Xiaowei, 2024)."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (AAD) is a life-threatening cardiovascular emergency with extremely high mortality, especially if complicated by cardiac arrest. Early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention are essential for survival but pose major difficulties in unstable patients. We describe the clinical course of a 68-year-old man with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to AAD. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed on-site and was in progress during transport. After achieving return of spontaneous circulation in the emergency department, emergency coronary angiography ruled out coronary artery disease and revealed aneurysmal dilation of the ascending aorta, severe aortic valve regurgitation, and an intimal flap consistent with dissection. The diagnosis of AAD from the aortic root to the iliac arteries, with pericardial and left pleural effusions, was confirmed by total-body computed tomography. Emergent surgical management included the replacement of the dissected ascending aorta with a 28 mm synthetic graft and replacement of the severely regurgitant aortic valve with a 21 mm bioprosthesis. The procedure was carried out with full circulatory arrest and axillary cannulation. The patient's postoperative course was complicated by coagulopathy and slow gradual neurological improvement, but ultimately, he had no evidence of ischemic or hemorrhagic brain injury. He was discharged in stable condition on the 15th postoperative day. Follow-up imaging showed stable chronic dissection of the descending aorta, as well as complete resolution of pleural and pericardial effusions. This case highlights the complexities of diagnosing and managing AAD in a patient presenting with cardiac arrest. It also demonstrates the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration, timely imaging, and advanced surgical techniques in overcoming the significant challenges associated with this critical condition."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (TAAD) is a life-threatening cardiovascular emergency with a high mortality rate. The peri-operative factors influencing in-hospital mortality among surgically treated TAAD patients remain unclear. This study aimed to identify key peri-operative risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Peri-operative laboratory data, surgical strategies, and TAAD-related risk factors, associated with mortality, were collected. Machine learning techniques were applied to evaluate the impact of various parameters on in-hospital mortality. Based on the findings, a nomogram model was developed and validated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis, calibration plots, and internal validation methods. A total of 199 patients with TAAD were included in the study cohort, which was divided into derivation and validation cohorts. Using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression method, 66 features were narrowed down to six key predictors. These included age, lymphocyte count, use of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time, duration of mechanical ventilation, and postoperative interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels, all of which were identified as significant risk factors for in-hospital mortality following TAAD surgery. We developed and validated a predictive model, presented as a nomogram, to estimate in-hospital survival in patients with TAAD. Post-operative IL-10 was identified as an independent prognostic factor for patients with TAAD. The combination of IL-10 with five additional indicators significantly improved the predictive accuracy, demonstrating superiority over the use of any single variable alone.

This single-centre retrospective study involved 154 patients who underwent emergency surgery for ATAAD between January 2019 and April 2024. The GERAADA and EuroSCORE II were calculated for each patient. Predictive accuracy for 30-day mortality was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). A multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors of mortality, and long-term outcomes were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. The 30-day mortality rate was 11.0%. The GERAADA score showed an AUC of 0.80, indicating good discriminatory ability, while the EuroSCORE II demonstrated moderate performance with an AUC of 0.67 (P = 0.07). The GERAADA score significantly overestimated mortality in this cohort, whereas the EuroSCORE II underestimated it. Independent predictors of mortality included the use of catecholamines at referral. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a 1-year survival rate of 79.4% with an AUC of 0.72, demonstrating the GERAADA score's utility as a predictor of long-term survival. The GERAADA score provides accurate predictions of 30-day mortality in Japanese patients undergoing ATAAD surgery, comparable to the EuroSCORE II. This score demonstrates robust predictive ability for short- and long-term outcomes and may serve as a practical tool for risk stratification in ATAAD surgery."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a life-threatening aortic emergency with high mortality. Currently, hemiarch replacement (HAR) and total arch replacement (TAR) are the primary surgeries for ATAAD, but their long-term outcomes remain debated, possibly due to the influence of clinical factors in multicenter studies. This study aims to evaluate the long-term outcomes of HAR and TAR by in silico analysis, mitigating the impact of clinical factors. A personalized model was reconstructed to simulate HAR and TAR by altering the material properties at the replacement regions, obtaining hemodynamic and wall response parameters through two-way fluid-structure interaction analysis. HAR exhibits a higher increase in von Mises stress at the anastomosis compared to pre-operation levels (HAR: 4.39 times normal, TAR: 2.42 times normal), increasing the risk of pseudoaneurysm formation. TAR induced more severe streamline absence in the arch branches, potentially resulting in intermittent blood flow to the upper limbs and brain. HAR poses a higher risk of pseudoaneurysm formation at the anastomosis, while TAR carries increased risks of upper limb and cerebral ischemia. Enhanced monitoring of the anastomosis in HAR patients and vigilance for upper limb fatigue and cerebral ischemic events in TAR patients are recommended. This study offers effective guidance for managing postoperative HAR and TAR patients, contributing to the prevention of complications and enhancing their postoperative quality of life."

    "abstract": "In emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection, the creation of needle holes can cause various issues and complications. One persistent challenge is the prevention of distal anastomotic new entry tears, which frequently necessitate additional intervention. Modification of the distal reinforcement technique offers a straightforward solution by combining existing hemostatic agents with tools such as occlusion balloons. We describe a modified distal reinforcement procedure employing a balloon-and-glue technique to help prevent new entry tears at the distal anastomosis and avoid total arch replacement. Ten patients with acute type A aortic dissection were treated using this technique. Postoperative computed tomography indicated no evidence of distal anastomotic entry tears. In conclusion, this modified distal reinforcement technique represents not only a method to prevent distal anastomotic new entry tears but also a palliative approach that may obviate the need for total arch replacement in patients in poor condition or of advanced age."

    "abstract": "Objective: To develop a nomogram based on the monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) for predicting the risk of aortic-related adverse events within 30 days in patients with acute uncomplicated type B aortic intramural hematoma. Methods: This single-center retrospective cohort study screened consecutive patients with acute uncomplicated type B aortic intramural hematoma treated at the Emergency and Cardiovascular Medicine Departments of the General Hospital of the Northern Theater Command from April 2018 to April 2024. Patients were divided into two groups based on the optimal MLR cut-off value for predicting aortic-related adverse events: low MLR and high MLR group. MLR was defined as the ratio of monocytes to lymphocytes. Aortic-related adverse events were defined as a composite of aortic-related death or aortic intramural hematoma progression (including aortic dissection and penetrating aortic ulcers) within 30 days. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve identified the optimal MLR cut-off value. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of aortic-related adverse events within 30 days, based on which nomogram models were constructed: the clinical characteristics model and the clinical characteristics-MLR model. The DeLong test was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of different risk models. The additional predictive value of MLR was assessed using the net reclassification index (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Results: A total of 332 patients were included, of whom 217 were male (65.4%), with an average age of (64.3±9.4) years. A total of 107 aortic-related adverse events occurred during the 30-day follow-up period. The optimal cut-off value for MLR was 0.529. There were 189 cases in the low MLR group (MLR<0.529) and 143 cases in the high MLR group (MLR≥0.529). The rate of aortic-related adverse events was higher in the high MLR group compared to the low MLR group (44.1% (63/143) vs. 23.3% (44/189), P<0.001), mainly due to a higher rate of progression to aortic dissection (9.8% (14/143) vs. 1.1% (2/189), P<0.001) and penetrating aortic ulcers (31.5% (45/143) vs. 20.6% (39/189), P=0.025). Multivariate analysis identified diabetes (OR=0.25, 95%CI 0.08-0.78, P=0.017), anemia (OR=3.45, 95%CI 1.28-9.27, P=0.014), maximum descending aorta diameter (OR=1.08, 95%CI 1.02-1.15, P=0.007), ulcer-like projections (OR=4.04, 95%CI 2.26-7.24, P<0.001), and MLR (OR=6.61, 95%CI 2.50-17.46, P<0.001) as independent predictors of aortic-related adverse events during the 30-day follow-up period. The clinical characteristics model includes diabetes, anemia, ulcer-like projections and maximum diameter of the descending aorta, and the clinical characteristics-MLR model includes the above clinical characteristics and MLR. The results of the DeLong test showed that the clinical characteristic-MLR model demonstrated a higher area under the ROC curve compared to the clinical characteristic model alone (0.784 (95%CI 0.736-0.841) vs. 0.742 (95%CI 0.691-0.788), P=0.031). The continuous NRI was 0.461 (95%CI 0.237-0.685, P<0.001) and the IDI was 0.077 (95%CI 0.043-0.112, P<0.001), indicating that the inclusion of the MLR in the model significantly improved the predictive accuracy.

We created perioperative bloodless protocol, but it includes an optimization to increase the preoperative hemoglobin level enough to tolerate cardiopulmonary bypass. However, it would be impossible to optimize such patients using the strategy in the setting of emergent surgery. We sought to create a surgical strategy in an effort to reduce blood loss for acute type A dissection patients refusing blood transfusion. We reviewed the records of two patients in our aortic surgery database who presented with acute aortic dissection and refused blood transfusion. These patients underwent two-staged aortic repair with ascending aortic replacement with debranching to the innominate and left common carotid arteries, followed by thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). : The two-staged procedure was successfully completed in two patients without any significant complication. The postoperative course was uneventful for both patients. Two-staged aortic repair in patients refusing blood transfusion can avoid circulatory arrest requiring deep hypothermia so as to reduce the risk of coagulopathy and blood loss."

Emergency physicians diagnosed ATAAD with AMI, and emergency surgery was planned in collaboration with the cardiovascular surgery team. One-stage surgery for coronary revascularization and central aortic repair were performed, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was implanted, ECMO was discontinued when hemodynamics stabilized. The patient ultimately recovered well and was discharged. For ATAAD combined with right ventricular AMI, one-stage surgery for coronary revascularization and central aortic repair, supported by ECMO as bridge, can be life-saving treatment strategy, the prognosis for all three patients was excellent."

This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive, population-based analysis of the association between weekend admission and the in-hospital outcomes of TAAD repair using a large-scale national registry.MethodsPatients who underwent TAAD repair were identified in National Inpatient Sample from Q4 2015-2020. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to compare in-hospital outcomes between patients admitted on the weekend vs weekday, where demographics, comorbidities, hospital characteristics, primary payer status, and transfer-in status were adjusted.ResultsThere were 1007 and 3275 patients who underwent TAAD repair under weekend and weekday admission, respectively. Patients admitted on the weekend were more likely to get transferred in from a different acute care hospital and have renal malperfusion. After multivariable analysis, patients admitted on the weekend and weekday had comparable times from admission to operation (0.88 ± 2.64 vs 0.92 ± 2.99 days, P = 0.64) and in-hospital mortality (15.99% vs 14.84%, aOR = 1.119, 95 CI = 0.914-1.37, P = 0.28). All other in-hospital outcomes, hospital length of stay, and total hospital charge were similar between the 2 cohorts.ConclusionPatients admitted on weekends and weekdays had comparable times from admission to operation, as well as similar in-hospital mortality and morbidities. These findings suggest the effectiveness of weekend emergency care protocols for TAAD patients and the lack of a \"weekend effect\" on TAAD repair in the United States."

    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: An acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a cardiovascular emergency with high mortality rates if left untreated. Survival has increased due to improvements in diagnosis and therapy. However, during their recovery, survivors frequently encounter major social, psychological, and physical challenges. This study aimed to evaluate the recovery experience of AAD survivors in The Netherlands. Insights on sleep quality, physical activity, and quality of life were collected from a unique nationwide cohort of AAD survivors recruited through the national patient support network 'Stichting Aorta Dissectie Nederland'. Methods: This study was conducted among AAD survivors who were recruited through a national association for aortic dissection known as 'Stichting Aorta Dissectie Nederland (SADN)'. The participants (n = 61) completed questionnaires assessing demographic data, physical activity, sleep quality, and health-related QoL. Results: The cohort had a mean age of 60.1 years, and 47.5% of the participants were female. The prevalence of sleep disruptions was high, as 55.7% of the people were categorized as bad sleepers (PSQI > 5). Poor sleep was associated with low physical activity and a higher BMI. The physical activity levels varied, with 47.5% reporting moderate activity levels and 44.3% reporting high activity levels. The QoL scores varied greatly among the participants, with significant impairment across all fields and reduced enthusiasm for daily activities. Poor sleepers reported significantly lower QoL (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our study highlights significant gaps in post-AAD care, particularly addressing QoL, sleep, and physical activity. By acknowledging the multifaceted nature of recovery, healthcare providers can develop tailored interventions that empower survivors to achieve better quality of life."

    "abstract": "Type A aortic dissection repair is one of the most common emergency cardiac surgical procedures undertaken in the UK and has a high mortality. Early diagnosis and prompt surgery by an expert cardiac surgical team is crucial. Little is known about the patient's journey from first symptoms until surgery. The Association for Cardiothoracic Anaesthesia and Critical Care undertook a prospective national audit of the management of type A aortic dissection in the UK. The details of 334 patients with type A aortic dissection were reported by 28 UK cardiac centres over 12 months. Median (IQR [range]) time from onset of symptoms until arrival in an emergency department was 2.3 (1.4-4.7 [0.1-491.6]) h. Median (IQR [range]) time between arrival in the emergency department and the start of surgery was 9.5 (6.1-18.2 [0.8-363.5]) h. Delays in diagnosis and transfers were reported in 158 (47.3%) patients. Fifty-two patients (15.6%) had an initial misdiagnosis. The condition of 56 patients (16.8%) deteriorated clinically before arrival in the operating theatre. A medical doctor accompanied 50 patients (15.0%) during transfer. Sixty-four patients (19.2%) died in hospital with 41 (12.3%) dying within the first 5 days after surgery. This audit provides a snapshot of current practice for patients with type A aortic dissection in the UK. Our findings show the acuity, clinical severity and vulnerability of patients with type A aortic dissection, and the deficits in the process of diagnosis and the quality of transfer. This audit demonstrates the need for the implementation of comprehensive, regionally governed, interdisciplinary medical management for every patient with type A aortic dissection."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) is a life-threatening cardiovascular emergency and currently lacks effective drug treatment. Inflammation is a critical mechanism in the development of AD, and identifying specific molecular targets to regulate inflammation is crucial for stopping its progression. This study aimed to investigate the role of MR-1 and ROCK1 in the regulation of inflammation in AD and their potentialities as therapeutic targets. Researchers performed protein immunoblotting on aortic wall tissue from 10 patients who underwent aortic arch replacement and 10 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to examine the expression levels of MR-1, ROCK1, and inflammatory pathways in the aortas. In vitro experiments, human aortic smooth muscle cells were extracted, and an in vitro dissection model was constructed with angiotensin II. siRNA silencing studies were performed to investigate the effects of MR-1 and ROCK1 on the development of AD and their interconnections. Analysis of aortic tissues revealed significantly elevated levels of MR-1 and ROCK1 in AD patients, and meanwhile the inflammatory indexes showed the same trend. Furthermore, it was observed that overexpression of MR-1 and ROCK1 facilitated smooth muscle cell phenotypic transformation and augmented matrix metalloproteinase release in in vitro settings through inflammatory pathway activation. The relationship between MR-1 and ROCK1 was elucidated, too. MR-1 and ROCK1 overexpression is associated with the occurrence and development of AD through inflammation. This study highlights the role of inflammation in AD development and tap the potentiality of using MR-1 and ROCK1 as targets to alleviate AD development."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic syndromes (AAS) such as aortic dissection, intramural hematoma, and penetrating aortic ulcer pose significant neurovascular risks, affecting patient outcomes. This review examines the incidence, clinical presentation, and outcomes of neurovascular complications in AAS patients. Common complications include stroke, spinal cord ischemia, and transient ischemic attacks, with stroke being the most prevalent. Managing aortic dissection necessitates careful blood pressure control to prevent dissection progression while avoiding compromised cerebral and spinal perfusion. Carotid involvement, particularly dissection, increases stroke and transient ischemic attack risks. Emergency surgical interventions, though essential to prevent rupture or repair dissection, carry risks of perioperative neurovascular complications. The use of electroencephalography and transcranial Doppler can aid in the early detection and monitoring of neurovascular events. We discuss the pros and cons of certain blood pressure medications in the acute treatment of aortic dissection. A multidisciplinary approach involving cardiovascular surgeons, neurologists, and critical care specialists is vital for optimizing outcomes and mitigating risks. Early recognition and management of neurovascular complications are crucial, and further research is needed to develop targeted prevention and treatment strategies."

    "abstract": "Background and Objective: Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) represents a critical and life-threatening condition requiring urgent surgical intervention, which is often life-saving. However, postoperative acute lung injury (ALI) has emerged as a prominent complication that significantly impacts patient outcomes and prognosis. This study aims to systematically analyze the risk factors associated with the development of severe ALI following ATAAD surgery, providing insights to improve postoperative management strategies. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted using a comprehensive database comprising 483 patients diagnosed with ATAAD. Patients were stratified into two groups based on the severity of postoperative ALI: severe ALI group (n = 182) and non-severe ALI group (n = 301). Clinical data were systematically collected and compared between the two cohorts. Binary logistic regression analysis was employed to identify independent predictors of severe ALI following ATAAD surgery. The diagnostic accuracy of these risk factors was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, with the area under the curve (AUC) serving as the metric for prognostic performance. Results: The severe ALI group exhibited a higher prevalence of preoperative oxygenation index (OI) ≤ 200 mmHg, smoking history, and coronary artery disease compared to the non-severe ALI group (P < 0.001, P = 0.032, and P = 0.039, respectively), while the prevalence of Marfan syndrome was lower (P = 0.033). Moreover, significant differences were observed in several clinical and intraoperative parameters, including body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), D-dimer, white blood cell count (WBC), aortic cross-clamp time, moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest (MHCA) time, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) duration, and ICU length of stay (all P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression identified preoperative OI [P = 0.008, OR (95% CI): 0.002 (0.000-0.183)], BMI [P = 0.037, OR (95% CI): 1.569 (1.027-2.397)], CRP [P = 0.022, OR (95% CI): 1.292 (1.037-1.609)], D-dimer [P < 0.001, OR (95% CI): 3.841 (1.820-8.108)], MHCA time [P = 0.001, OR (95% CI): 3.306 (1.670-6.544)], and CPB duration [P = 0.017, OR (95% CI): 1.117 (1.020-1.223)] as independent predictors of severe ALI. ROC curve analysis revealed the diagnostic performance of preoperative OI, BMI, CRP, D-dimer, MHCA time, and CPB duration, with AUC values of 0.715, 0.844, 0.871, 0.955, 0.944, and 0.833, respectively (all P < 0.001). Conclusion: Preoperative oxygenation index, BMI, CRP, D-dimer levels, MHCA time, and CPB duration are independent risk factors for the development of severe ALI following ATAAD surgery. These findings underscore the importance of preoperative risk assessment and perioperative optimization to mitigate the risk of severe ALI and improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Maternal sepsis is a complication that can be difficult to diagnose in the early stages because symptoms can be vague or attributed to other conditions. We present the case of a 38-year-old woman, in her third pregnancy with a diagnosis of uncontrolled gestational diabetes, who developed urinary origin sepsis in the second trimester of pregnancy. The patient was initially admitted with a clinical presentation interpreted as a urinary tract infection. However, her condition quickly deteriorated with sudden dyspnea, hypotension, and tachycardia. She was approached as a probable aortic dissection and transferred to a tertiary care facility for definitive treatment. Upon arrival at the reference center, the diagnosis of urinary focus sepsis was established, with imaging studies showing right pyelocaliceal dilatation and inflammatory process. The appropriate antibiotic treatment was delayed due to the lack of an early diagnosis, leading to clinical deterioration that necessitated urgent surgery. The therapeutic approach included broad-spectrum antibiotics and the placement of a right JJ catheter with drainage of purulent material, followed by intensive management. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge posed by maternal sepsis and underscores the critical role of early recognition through scoring systems, emphasizing the need for increased clinical suspicion and immediate attention."

    "abstract": "Takayasu's arteritis (TA) is an autoimmune disease that invades large arteries and mostly occurs in women of childbearing age. It leads to thickening and loss of elasticity of the arterial wall, and eventually vascular occlusion, aneurysm or dissection formation. Type B aortic dissection (TBAD) during pregnancy is a rare disease, which is mostly caused by the increase of blood volume in circulation during pregnancy, the effect of estrogen and progesterone on the aorta, or congenital diseases. TBAD in TA pregnant women is very rare, and the condition is often complicated. It is necessary to make a multidisciplinary treatment plan and determine the timing and method of operation to save the life of mother and fetus. We report a pregnant woman at 35 weeks of gestation who presented to the emergency department with sudden and continuously unrelieved chest pain. She had TA for five years. Thoracoabdominal aortic computed tomography with angiography (CTA) showed acute TBAD. Her blood pressure was 209/73 mmHg and could not be lowered with Urapidil, therefore she was diagnosed with complex Stanford type B aortic dissection. She underwent cesarean section under general anesthesia, and the tracheal tube was not removed after surgery. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) was administered under anesthesia 8 h after cesarean section. Intraoperative aortography showed that the stent blocked the tear of the intima of the aorta, and the false cavity was reduced. Her blood pressure was reduced to the normal range (140/90 mmHg or less), and the baby's vital signs were stable. They were discharged five days later. Use steroids to control TA throughout treatment. One year after the operation, the mother was healthy and the baby developed well. Early identification and accurate diagnosis should be made for acute TBAD in late pregnancy. Under the premise of stable hemodynamics, the fetus is delivered by cesarean section first and then TEVAR is the preferred treatment. The diagnosis and treatment plan of AD during pregnancy should be developed and implemented by multiple disciplines according to the vital signs of mother and fetus. TA pregnant women should take steroids during pregnancy, closely detect inflammatory indicators, and avoid pathogenic microbial infection, inflammatory state and complications. At the same time, the necessary follow-up is also the key to ensure the treatment effect."

    "abstract": "Owing to the time-sensitive nature of myocardial ischemia, challenging clinical scenarios should be considered in patients with type A acute aortic dissection (AAAD) complicated by coronary malperfusion. In clinical settings, the diagnosis and reperfusion strategies for coronary malperfusion often depend on institutional resources. This study evaluated early surgical outcomes in such patients, focusing on transportation type and clinical management. We retrospectively reviewed 70 patients who underwent emergency surgery for AAAD with coronary malperfusion, excluding those with cardiac tamponade on arrival, between 1997 and February 2024. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on transportation: direct transfer and referral. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 27%, with only 1 of 9 patients surviving with preoperative peripheral extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Mortality and morbidity did not significantly differ between groups. Univariate analysis identified left coronary artery involvement and preoperative hemodynamic instability as significant risk factors. Additionally, preoperative diagnostic-only coronary angiography (CAG) with unsuccessful reperfusion was a potential risk factor (P = 0.06). Regardless of transportation type, preoperative peripheral ECMO itself could not be a definitive solution in AAAD patients with coronary malperfusion. Also, patients who underwent preoperative CAG with unsuccessful reperfusion might be fatal, especially with suspected left coronary artery involvement."

Clinical manifestations might include severe chest pain to neurological deficits, depending on the arterial segments involved. Extensive dissections involving multiple aortic segments and branch vessel occlusions, such as the carotid arteries, are rare and pose unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. We describe the case of a 64-year-old male, an active smoker with obesity, who presented to the emergency department with altered consciousness. He was found to have an extensive aortic dissection involving the ascending, arch, descending, and abdominal aorta, as well as occlusion of the right carotid artery. An urgent combined cardiothoracic and vascular surgical approach was undertaken. Despite suffering an ischemic stroke, the patient recovered successfully after a comprehensive rehabilitation program. This case underscores the importance of early recognition and a multidisciplinary strategy in managing extensive aortic dissection with neurological compromise. It highlights the potential of innovative surgical techniques and tailored rehabilitation to optimize outcomes in these complex cases."

    "title": "Heart in Focus: Advancing Pericardial Effusion Diagnosis With Point-of-Care Ultrasound.",
    "abstract": "Pericardial effusion refers to the accumulation of fluid within the pericardial sac, the double-layered membrane surrounding the heart. It can be caused by various medical conditions and may lead to serious complications if not diagnosed and managed promptly. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has emerged as a valuable tool in the clinical evaluation of pericardial effusions, offering real-time visualization and aiding in the assessment of its size, characteristics, and potential hemodynamic impact. This comprehensive revision explores the utility of POCUS in diagnosing and managing pericardial effusions. POCUS has gained prominence as a bedside diagnostic tool due to its immediacy, accuracy, and non-invasive nature. This study investigates how POCUS can address critical gaps in current diagnostic approaches, such as delays in diagnosis using traditional imaging modalities and challenges in resource-limited settings, thereby enhancing patient outcomes and clinical decision-making. A search was conducted on PubMed in August of 2023, using the keywords \"POCUS\" and \"pericardial\" as MeSH terms and reference mining. A total of 19 articles were included in this review. Characterization and quantification of pericardial effusion (PEF) using POCUS can provide clinicians with critical clues regarding the underlying etiology. This information, combined with other hemodynamic parameters, should guide subsequent management decisions. POCUS enables the identification of key sonographic findings, such as diastolic collapse of the right chambers, abnormal septal movement, and an engorged inferior vena cava (IVC), which together raise a high clinical suspicion of cardiac tamponade. Beyond its utility in identifying tamponade, POCUS plays a significant role in detecting subtle yet life-threatening conditions, such as aortic dissection, which may manifest as pericardial effusion due to hemopericardium. While POCUS is not definitive for diagnosing aortic dissection, indirect findings such as a pericardial effusion with hemodynamic compromise, coupled with high clinical suspicion, should prompt further imaging like CT angiography for confirmation. We propose an algorithmic approach: if cardiac tamponade is confirmed on POCUS, emergent pericardiocentesis is warranted. If ruled out, further investigations should be directed toward identifying the underlying cause of the PEF, including potentially ruling out aortic dissection to avoid missing a subtle but critical condition. POCUS has revolutionized the clinical evaluation of pericardial effusions, providing clinicians with a rapid and accurate bedside tool for diagnosis and management. Its ability to assess effusion size, identify cardiac tamponade, and guide pericardiocentesis procedures has proven invaluable in improving patient outcomes. Integrating POCUS into routine clinical practice enhances diagnostic accuracy and timely intervention, ensuring better care for patients with pericardial effusions. However, it is important to acknowledge its limitations. POCUS is highly operator-dependent, with diagnostic accuracy varying based on the clinician's experience and training. Additionally, the availability of ultrasound equipment and adequately trained personnel can be a barrier, particularly in resource-limited settings. Addressing these challenges is crucial to maximizing the utility of POCUS in clinical practice."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection is a life-threatening cardiovascular emergency with high mortality rates. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a critical complication in patients with acute aortic dissection; however, its incidence and impact on outcomes remain inconclusive. This study aimed to evaluate DIC prevalence and prognosis in patients with aortic dissection. We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study using data from the Japan Medical Data Center claims database between 2014 and 2022. DIC was diagnosed based on the criteria of the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM-2) and the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH). We compared the in-hospital mortality between patients with and without DIC and assessed the impact of coagulopathy using various coagulation profiles. Among the 3037 patients, 40% underwent surgery and 60% did not undergo surgery. The prevalence rates of JAAM-2 DIC and ISTH DIC were 21% and 9.4%, respectively. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in the DIC group than in the non-DIC group, and this trend was consistently observed in the surgery and nonsurgery groups. Increased DIC scores correlated with higher in-hospital mortality. With the progression of coagulopathy, characterized by thrombocytopenia, elevated prothrombin time-international normalized ratio, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, increased D-dimer, and decreased fibrinogen levels, in-hospital mortality also increased. The presence of DIC, as identified by both the JAAM-2 and ISTH criteria, was associated with increased in-hospital mortality in patients with acute aortic dissection. Therefore, further studies are needed to improve the clinical outcomes of these patients."

We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) among this critically ill population. The design of this study was a retrospective cohort study. The study population was recruited in the Emergency Department of Fuwai hospital in China from 2018 to 2020. We consecutively enrolled 829 patients with acute type A aortic dissection and measurable baseline NT-proBNP. The primary endpoint was 1-year all-cause death. Based on tertiles of NT-proBNP (pg/mL), patients were stratified into low (≤150.3, n=276), intermediate (150.3-667.6, n=277) and high (>667.6, n=276) NT-proBNP groups. Compared with patients with low NT-proBNP, the Kaplan-Meier estimates for primary 1-year mortality were higher in intermediate (32.5% vs 18.1%; HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.69) and high (42.0% vs 18.1%; HR 2.56, 95% CI 1.84 to 3.57) NT-proBNP groups, respectively. After multivariable regression adjusted for confounders, NT-proBNP tertiles were independent predictors for 1-year mortality (adjusted HR for intermediate group 1.52, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.27; adjusted HR for high group 2.17, 95% CI 1.41 to 3.32). Notably, the predictive performance of NT-proBNP for 1-year mortality was greater in patients receiving surgery than conservative treatment (between-cohorts difference in area under the curve 0.13, Delong's test p=0.04). NT-proBNP provides incremental prognostic information for mortality in patients with acute type A aortic dissection who underwent surgical repairment, which could aid in risk stratification as a pragmatic and versatile biomarker in this critically ill population while having limited prognostic value for those receiving conservative treatment."

Discerning the etiology of chest pain based on history and physical exam alone is challenging as symptomatology can overlap with multiple organ systems.9 Therefore, physicians often rely on testing to reach a diagnosis, a practice which costs the United States healthcare system billions of dollars per year.4 In this review, we aim to identify the cardiac-testing modalities available to clinicians to accurately diagnose a cause of chest pain and consider which test might be most appropriate for patients evaluated in the ambulatory or ED setting."

This study included patients aged ≤40 with ATAAD who underwent surgical treatment at our institution between 2015 and 2019. The patients were categorized into groups according to heritable thoracic aortic disease (HTAD) presence or absence. The primary outcomes were in-hospital and late mortality, and aortic-related re-intervention. Our cohort included 141 patients aged ≤ 40, representing 14.6% of all patients with ATAAD treated during the same period. 35.5% (50 of 141) of these cases were associated with HTAD. Among them, only 16.0% were aware of their condition prior to the occurrence of ATAAD. Most patients underwent extensive arch procedures and in-hospital mortality rate of patients was 14.2%, which was higher in the HTAD group than in the non-HTAD group (20.0% vs. 11.0%, p = .142). The overall 7-year survival was 80.0%. Twenty patients required late aortic reoperations, with emergency surgeries accounting for 45% of the cases. The incidence of reoperation was significantly higher in the HTAD group than that in the non-HTAD group (p = .03). In addition, the late aortic reoperation remained a risk factor for long-term survival after adjusting for clinical factors. The prevalence of HTAD is high in the cohort of younger patients with ATAAD. HTAD is associated with high rates of in-hospital mortality and late reoperation. Extensive primary aortic repair is safe and has long-term benefits in young patients with ATAAD. Regular imaging assessment of the thoracoabdominal aorta after surgery is imperative for improving the long-term prognosis."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a life-threatening condition that requires emergent surgical intervention. Numerous surgical approaches exist for ATAAD, and controversy remains regarding the optimal arch interventions for ATAAD patients. Aortic Arch Interventions: Approaches to ATAAD repair include hemiarch repair or extended arch repairs, including the hemiarch with a hybrid stent implantation, such as the AMDS hybrid Prosthesis, total arch replacement (TAR), and the use of an elephant trunk and frozen elephant trunk. While indications for each procedure exist, such as entry tears in the arch, arch aneurysms, and head vessel communications for TAR and malperfusion and a reduced risk of distal anastomotic new entry tears in Debakey I aortic dissection for the AMDS and frozen elephant trunks, the optimal intervention depends on numerous factors. Surgeon and center experience, resource availability, patient risk, and anatomy all contribute to the decision-making process. TAR has improved in safety over the years and has been demonstrated to be comparable to the hemiarch repair in terms of safety in many settings. TAR may also prevent adverse remodeling and can effectively treat more distal diseases, the presence of arch tears, arch aneurysms, and branch vessel involvement or malperfusion. Numerous surgical approaches exist to manage ATAAD, allowing for the surgeon to tailor the repair to the individual patient and pathology. TAR allows for single or staged repair of extensive pathologies and can address distal entry tears, the aneurysmal arch, and head vessel pathologies. In cases with malperfusion, an AMDS can be used in many cases. The management strategy for ATAAD should always involve performing the best surgery for the patient, although in cases where a total arch is indicated but cannot be performed safely by a non-aortic surgeon, the safest approach may be to perform a hemiarch initially and to plan for an elective arch reoperation in the case it is required following close surveillance."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) requires emergency surgery, but the choice of primary surgery remains controversial. It is believed that simple ascending aorta replacement may lead to higher postoperative survival rate, while the Sun procedure [frozen elephant trunk (FET) + total arch replacement (TAR)] performed in the first stage may obtain better long-term results. The study aimed to compare the outcome of ATAAD patients who underwent the Sun procedure with those without TAR + FET. Data of 452 patients with ATAAD admitted to Beijing Anzhen Hospital for surgical treatment from August 1, 2020, to August 16, 2022, were collected and analyzed. Patients with the Sun procedure (n=344) were compared to those without the Sun procedure (n=108). The two groups of patients were matched using propensity score matching (PSM), and the risk factors of poor prognosis were analyzed. The average postoperative follow-up period was 976±414 days, and the loss of follow-up rate was 0. The postoperative 30-day mortality rates were 12.56% and 5.38% in the Sun procedure group and the non-Sun procedure group after PSM matching, respectively (P=0.06). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that postoperative cardiogenic shock, postoperative cerebral malperfusion syndrome (MPS), postoperative spinal MPS, and need for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) were independent risk factors for postoperative 30-day death. The 3-year survival rates were 85.02% and 91.40% in the Sun procedure group and the non-Sun procedure group after PSM matching, respectively (P=0.12). According to multivariate cox regression analysis, the independent risk factors associated with postoperative midterm death were consistent with those associated with 30-day postoperative death that pointed out by logistic regression. The incidence of spinal MPS after the Sun procedure was higher than that in the non-Sun procedure group (P=0.003). At 3-year follow-up, the probability of no distal aortic events (DAEs) was 97.17% and 91.59%, in the Sun procedure group and non-Sun procedure group, respectively, representing a significant difference (P=0.02). Multivariate Cox regression showed that Marfan syndrome and non-Sun procedure were risk factors for DAEs. Fine-Gray analysis also produced results similar to multifactor cox regression analysis, that Marfan syndrome and non-Sun procedure were risk factors for DAEs. There was no significant difference in postoperative mortality between the Sun procedure group and the non-Sun procedure group. The incidence of spinal MPS in the Sun procedure group was higher than that in the non-Sun procedure group, while the incidence of DAEs in the Sun procedure group was lower than that in non-Sun procedure group."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection is a serious cardiovascular emergency with a high mortality rate. Its pathogenesis is complex and remains unclear. This study aimed to assess the connection between the levels of genetically predicted circulating metabolites and the risk of aortic dissection. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach was employed to determine the causal relationship between genetically determined metabolites and the incidence of aortic dissection. In total, 1091 specific metabolites were identified from genome-wide association study (GWAS) data and aortic dissection involving 207,011 participants. Causal inference was performed using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, supplemented by extensive sensitivity analyses to ensure the validity of the results. In addition, pathway analysis was performed using the Metaconflict 5.0 platform. We found that six serum metabolites were genetically associated with an increased risk of aortic dissection, whereas eleven metabolites were associated with a decreased risk, and these associations were confirmed by rigorous sensitivity analyses. Reverse MR analysis indicated that aortic dissection could decrease the serum level of kynurenine (odds ratio (OR) = 0.9675, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9383-0.9976, P IVW = 0.0344). The metabolic pathways suggested that steroid hormone biosynthesis, steroidogenesis, and bile acid biosynthesis are involved in the pathogenesis of aortic dissection. This MR analysis revealed a significant association between seventeen serum metabolites and the risk of aortic dissection. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the complex mechanisms underlying these associations. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12055-024-01807-5."

    "abstract": "Acute abdominal aortic dissection (AD) is a serious disease. Early detection based on ultrasound (US) can improve the prognosis of AD, especially in emergency settings. We explored the ability of deep learning (DL) to diagnose abdominal AD in US images, which may help the diagnosis of AD by novice radiologists or non-professionals. There were 374 US images from patients treated before June 30, 2022. The images were classified as AD-positive and AD-negative images. Among them, 90% of images were used as the training set, and 10% of images were used as the test set. A Densenet-169 model and a VGG-16 model were used in this study and compared with two human readers. DL models demonstrated high sensitivity and AUC for diagnosing abdominal AD in US images, and DL models showed generally better performance than human readers. Our findings demonstrated the efficacy of DL-aided diagnosis of abdominal AD in US images, which can be helpful in emergency settings."

    "abstract": "A short cut review of the literature was carried out to examine whether a decision rule in conjunction with a D-dimer can be used to rule out aortic dissection. 117 unique papers were found of which three systematic reviews included data on patients relevant to the clinical question; these are discussed in the paper. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of the best papers are tabulated. The clinical bottom line is that in low-risk patients (aortic dissection detection risk score 0 or 1) who present to the Emergency Department with chest pain, a negative D-dimer level makes aortic dissection unlikely. However, further prospective validation studies are needed to optimally define the patient group that warrants investigation, the threshold for investigation and the clinical effectiveness of such a diagnostic strategy before it can be widely adopted."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (AAD) and acute type A intramural hematoma (AIMH) are life-threatening conditions with high mortality rates, and prognostic indicators are critical for guiding urgent treatment decisions. We assessed the prognostic significance of admission D-dimer levels in patients with AAD and AIMH. The prospective, multicenter, observational study in China recruited participants from 2013 to 2019. Patients with AAD and AIMH were respectively categorized into quartiles based on admission D-dimer levels. Cox regression analysis was used to assess the association between D-dimer levels and mortality. A total of 3132 patients with AAD (mean age: 50.63 years [SD, 12.56]) and 353 patients with AIMH (mean age: 59.63 years [SD, 11.00]) were included. In patients with AAD, overall mortality rates increased across D-dimer quartiles: 13.7% (Q1, ≤0.72 mg/L), 16.7% (Q2, 0.72-1.91 mg/L), 22.8% (Q3, 1.91-4.21 mg/L), and 28.5% (Q4, 4.21-20.00 mg/L). In patients with AIMH, mortality rates by quartile were 3.4% (Q1, ≤0.51 mg/L), 5.7% (Q2, 0.51-1.25 mg/L), 4.6% (Q3, 1.25-3.44 mg/L), and 10.2% (Q4, 3.44-20.00 mg/L). After adjusting for confounders, D-dimer was an independent predictor of overall mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.42 [95% CI, 1.11-1.80]) and in-hospital mortality (HR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.13-1.92]) in patients with AAD. D-dimer levels were not significantly associated with the overall (HR, 2.61 [95% CI, 0.70-9.73]) or in-hospital mortality (HR, 1.78 [95% CI, 0.44-7.24]) of patients with AIMH by multivariable adjustment. Elevated admission D-dimer levels are independently associated with higher mortality in patients with AAD but are not significantly associated with prognosis in patients with AIMH. Our findings suggest that D-dimer may serve as a useful prognostic marker in patients with AAD. www.chictr.org.cn. Unique identifier: ChiCTR230006854."

    "abstract": "Patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD) are often asymptomatic but present acutely with life threatening complications that necessitate emergency intervention. Aortic diameter measurement using computed tomography (CT) is considered the gold standard for diagnosis, surgical planning, and monitoring. However, manual measurement can create challenges in clinical workflows due to its time-consuming, labour-intensive nature and susceptibility to human error. With advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), several models have emerged in recent years for automated aortic diameter measurement. This article aims to review the performance and clinical relevance of these models in relation to clinical workflows. We performed literature searches in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science to identify relevant studies published between 2014 and 2024, with the focus on AI and deep learning aortic diameter measurements in screening and diagnosis of TAAD. Twenty-four studies were retrieved in the past ten years, highlighting a significant knowledge gap in the field of translational medicine. The discussion included an overview of AI-powered models for aortic diameter measurement, as well as current clinical guidelines and workflows. This article provides a thorough overview of AI and deep learning models designed for automatic aortic diameter measurement in the screening and diagnosis of thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs). We emphasize not only the performance of these technologies but also their clinical significance in enabling timely interventions for high-risk patients. Looking ahead, we envision a future where AI and deep learning-powered automatic aortic diameter measurement models will streamline TAAD clinical management."

    "abstract": "Type B aortic dissection (TBAD) represents a serious medical emergency with up to a 50% associated 5-year mortality caused by thoracic aorta, dissection-associated aneurysmal (DAA) degeneration, and rupture. Unfortunately, conventional size-related diagnostic methods cannot distinguish high-risk DAAs that benefit from surgical intervention from stable DAAs. Our goal is to use DAA stiffness measured with magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) as a biomarker to distinguish high-risk DAAs from stable DAAs. This is a feasibility study using MRE to (1) fabricate human-like geometries TBAD phantoms with different stiffnesses, (2) measure stiffness in TBAD phantoms with rheometry, and (3) demonstrate the first successful application of MRE to the thoracic aorta of a human volunteer. AD phantoms with heterogenous wall stiffness demonstrated the correlation between MRE-derived stiffness and rheometric measured stiffness. A pilot scan was performed in a healthy volunteer to test the technique's feasibility in the thoracic aorta."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) has a high mortality, and acute aortic repair is the only curative treatment. In patients treated with factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors, the risk of severe disease-related complications such as cardiac tamponade and hemodynamic shock must be balanced against the potential for severe perioperative bleeding. The aim was to study intraoperative changes in plasma levels of the FXa inhibitor apixaban when using hemoadsorption during acute thoracic aortic repair. This is a single-center prospective cohort study. Eight apixaban-treated patients presenting with ATAAD underwent acute thoracic aortic repair with intraoperative hemoadsorption with CytoSorb. Apixaban concentrations were measured at the start of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and after 5, 15, 30, 60, and 90 min of CPB, at CPB weaning, 30 min after CPB weaning and 24 h postoperatively, using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). After 30 min of CPB with hemoadsorption, mean apixaban concentration (±SD) was reduced by 59% from 108 (±69) µg/l to 44 (±20) µg/l (P=0.009). There was a further reduction to 37 (±17) µg/l at CPB weaning (P=0.008). Apixaban concentration displayed an increase to 56 (±29) µg/l 24 h postoperatively (P=0.01). In-hospital mortality was 25%. The mean 24H chest tube drainage volume was 621 (±136) ml. Intraoperative hemoadsorption lowers apixaban levels in patients undergoing emergency surgery for ATAAD. Further research is needed to determine its impact on perioperative bleeding complications and mortality."

    "abstract": "Cervical aortic arch (CAA) is a rare malformation. Herein, we report a 58-year-old female patient diagnosed with left CAA with descending aortic aneurysm. Initially, the descending aorta replacement was planned via left rib-cross thoracotomy. However, because of intraoperative aortic dissection during mobilization, total arch replacement was performed via emergent median sternotomy first. The main body of the synthetic graft was then guided to the left thoracotomy view, and the peripheral anastomosis of the descending aorta was performed. The surgery was successfully completed. The surgical management of CAA remains unstandardized due to its rarity and complex abnormalities. As aortic wall thinning can easily lead to aortic dissection, careful manipulation is required during mobilization."

    "abstract": "To develop and validate a model system using deep learning algorithms for the automatic detection of type A aortic dissection (AD), and differentiate it from normal and type B AD patients. In this retrospective study, a deep learning model is developed, based on aortic computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans of 498 patients using training, validation and test sets of 398, 50 and 50 patients, respectively. An independent test set of 316 patients is used to validate and evaluate its performance. Our model comprises two components. The first one is an objection detection model, which can identify the aorta from CTA. The second one is a dissection classification model, which can automatically detect the presence of aortic dissection and determine its type based on Stanford classification. Overall, the sensitivity and specificity for Type A AD were 0.969 and 0.982, for Type B AD were 0.946 and 0.996 and for normal cases were 0.988 and 1.000, respectively. The average processing time per CTA scan was 7.9 ± 2.8 s. (mean ± standard deviation). This deep learning automatic model can accurately and quickly detect type A AD patients, and could serve as an imaging triage in an emergency setting and facilitate early intervention and surgery to decrease the mortality rates of type A AD patients."

    "title": "Organ-specific malperfusion in acute type A aortic dissection: epidemiological meta-analysis of incidence rates.",
    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection is a life-threatening clinical emergency that necessitates immediate surgical intervention with an estimated mortality rate of approximately 1-2% per hour. When complicated by malperfusion, the perioperative mortality rate is reported to be increased by up to 39%. Malperfusion can affect many vascular beds with varying incidence and severity, resulting in coronary, cerebral, visceral, peripheral, renal or spinal malperfusion. The primary aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to investigate the epidemiology of specific types of organ malperfusion in acute type A aortic dissection and to analyse the impact on the survival outcomes associated with each malperfusion type. Electronic databases PubMed, MEDLINE and Embase were searched through to September 2024 to identify original studies that presented data on the incidence and the survival outcome of organ malperfusion in association with acute type A aortic dissection. The extracted data included patient characteristics and incidence of organ-specific malperfusion. Primary outcomes were the respective in-hospital mortality rate associated with each organ-specific malperfusion and a proportional meta-analysis was conducted to pool results. Quality assessment was performed using the modified National Institutes of Health quality assessment tool for single-arm observational studies. A total of 40 studies met the inclusion criteria, including a total of 35 361 patients. Peripheral limb malperfusion was the most prevalent with a pooled incidence of 12% (95% c.i. 10 to 14). This was followed by lower limb or iliofemoral with 11% (95% c.i. 9 to 14). Spinal malperfusion was the lowest with 1% (95% c.i. 1 to 2). The pooled mortality rate with organ malperfusion varied between 18 and 36%. Within this population the highest mortality rate was associated with mesenteric malperfusion with 36% (95% c.i. 28 to 45). Following this the highest mortality rate was found with coronary at 33% (95% c.i. 26 to 40) and cerebral at 28% (95% c.i. 24 to 33) malperfusion. Survival during hospital admission after acute type A aortic dissection can vary depending on the presence and type of malperfusion, with mesenteric, coronary and cerebral malperfusion being associated with the highest in-hospital mortality rates. Organ-specific malperfusion syndromes should be considered when assessing the perioperative risk and surgical planning of patients undergoing surgical repair for acute type A aortic dissection."

Imaging revealed an aortoesophageal fistula. The patient was taken emergently for thoracic endovascular aortic repair to cover the area of potential fistula. Due to the patient being a poor operative candidate, the decision was made to treat with endoluminal esophageal wound vacuum therapy. He underwent twice weekly endoscopies with sponge changes until discharge; he has done well since. Wound vacuum therapy in conjunction with thoracic endovascular aortic repair may represent a treatment option for patients with aortoesophageal fistula who are poor candidates for surgery."

This study's aims were to assess the clinical outcomes of the fenestrated FET technique for ATAAD and to identify its best practices and pitfalls. This study included 101 patients who underwent emergency surgical aortic repair for ATAAD at our hospital between October 2018 and April 2023. We analyzed the perioperative and postoperative outcomes of those treated with the fenestrated FET technique (n = 65). The rate of postoperative thrombosed false lumen at the distal aortic arch after the fenestrated FET technique was 87%. In most cases, the location of the distal end of the FET was T6 or T7. The rate of distal stent-induced new entry was 8%. The operation time, aorta cross-clamp time, and extracorporeal circulation time were shorter in patients in whom the fenestrated FET technique was performed than in those treated with conventional total arch replacement. Eight patients had secondary aortic events in the follow-up period and were able to be treated by endovascular techniques. The fenestrated FET technique offers the advantage of low invasiveness during emergent aortic repair. It also provides an option for secondary therapy in cases of late aortic events. Overall, this technique has potential to improve both early and late outcomes of therapy for ATAAD."

    "abstract": "Chest pain is a common reason patients are admitted to the hospital. The most clinically significant cases are those in which the pain is due to an immediate life-threatening condition, such as acute aortic dissection (AAD). A prompt and correct diagnosis is crucial to patient survival. This case report of a patient who presented with chest pain confirms the appropriateness of urgent imaging tests e.g. POCUS when AAD is suspected in high-risk patients, regardless of the results of additional laboratory tests such as the D-dimer (DD) assay. A 72-year-old female patient was brought by the emergency medical team to the emergency room due to fainting without loss of consciousness and severe chest pain. Owing to worsening hypotonia and recurrent chest pain, a thoracic computed tomography (CT scan) was performed and subsequently revealed aortic dissection within the ascending segment with bleeding into the pericardial sac. The results of previously ordered laboratory tests, including the DD assay, were unremarkable and were obtained only after the thoracic CT scan had been acquired. Despite prompt medical intervention, the patient died. Vigilance is required when diagnosing chest pain in high-risk patients who are suspected of having AAD. The case presented in this report confirms the importance of a thorough history and physical examination as well as prompt diagnostic imaging e.g. POCUS or CT scan. Dedicated laboratory tests such as the DD assay, while often helpful, may fail to reveal remarkable abnormalities in time for medical intervention."

All individuals aged 18 years and older with more than 6 months of cannabis use at the time of surgical repair for cardiovascular disease (aortic aneurysms or aortic dissection) between 2007 and 2023 were eligible. Patients were stratified into 2 groups based on their preoperative history of cannabis use: cannabis users and noncannabis users. The primary end point was complications or death within 30 days of intervention. Secondary outcomes included late complications and reinterventions. Data were combined from our institution and inpatient hospital records. We identified 134 patients who met the inclusion criteria out of 1543 treated patients (9%). Compared with the nonusing cannabis group, individuals in the cannabis group were significantly younger (cannabis: 48.3 ± 11.8 years vs noncannabis: 58.5 ± 14.9 years; P < .001). The cannabis group included significantly higher patients with Marfan syndrome (cannabis: 11.2% vs noncannabis: 4.4%; P < .001). Furthermore, the cannabis group showed significantly higher history of recreational drug use, including cocaine (25.4% vs 1.6%; P < .001), amphetamines (3.7% vs 0.6%; P < .001), opioids (8.2% vs 0.5%; P < .001), and intravenous drugs (6.7% vs 0.6%; P < .001). Emergency surgeries were significantly more frequent in the cannabis group (cannabis: 56.7% vs noncannabis: 36.2%; P < .001). Surgical mortality was comparable between both groups (cannabis: 9.7% vs noncannabis: 8.6%; P = .662). Postoperative stroke was significantly higher in the cannabis group (cannabis: 14.9% vs noncannabis: 8.2%; P = .009), and the rate of postoperative respiratory complications was also significantly higher in the cannabis group (cannabis: 32.1% vs noncannabis: 19.0%; P < .001). The increased rates of postoperative cerebrovascular accidents and respiratory complications suggest that cannabis use is a significant risk factor in aortic surgery. Our study showed that young, healthy patients with prolonged cannabis use might be at a higher risk of requiring more emergency surgeries due to their background."

This study examined the effects of the Glue + Felt technique, which uses biological glue and felt to repair the proximal anastomotic site, on the outcomes of patients with acute type A aortic dissection. A total of 108 patients who underwent surgery for acute type A aortic dissection at our clinic between 2007 and 2020 were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups: the \"Glue + Felt Technique\" and the \"Bentall-De Bono\" groups, based on the surgical technique used for the aortic root. The effects of these two techniques on the development of intraoperative and postoperative complications and survival rates were statistically analyzed. The Glue + Felt technique was used for 76 patients, while the Bentall-De Bono technique was used for 32 patients. The Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed significant differences in survival rates between the two groups over the entire follow-up period, both with and without propensity score matching (p < 0.001 and p = 0.02, respectively). However, no significant differences were observed in comparisons beyond the first 30 days of follow-up, either with or without propensity score matching (p = 0.573 and p = 0.561, respectively). The main factors contributing to this difference were the duration of cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp time (p < 0.05). During the average follow-up period of 46.2 ± 31.6 months, no re-intervention was required in patients from the Glue-Felt technique group. The mortality rate in aortic dissection surgery is higher with more extensive surgical intervention as the duration of cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp time increases. Repairing the lumen and reducing operation time in suitable patients using the Glue-Felt technique for the proximal anastomotic site positively impacts postoperative complications and improves in-hospital and 30-day survival rates, without increasing long-term re-intervention rates."

Novel serum biomarkers can potentially help in early detection and estimation of postoperative outcomes. Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a critical effector of the Hippo pathway, our aim was to explore the association between YAP and the diagnosis and prognosis of AD. We prospectively recruited 110 consecutive chest-pain patients [acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD), n = 60; acute coronary syndrome (ACS), n = 50]. Blood samples were collected to determine levels of YAP and other serum biomarkers, and receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) were constructed to assess the predictability in early diagnosis of AAD and postoperative major adverse events (MAEs). YAP concentration was substantially elevated among ATAAD patients [3.45 (3.18, 3.63) vs. 2.44 (2.23, 2.59), P < 0.01]. Moreover, the white blood cell (WBC) count and plasma fibrin D-dimers were remarkably high among ATAAD patients [11.46 (9.57, 14.03) vs. 6.24 (5.10, 7.30), P < 0.01; 2,097.00 (998.75, 3,652.00) vs. 97.00 (67.25, 137.00), P < 0.01]. The serum YAP level held as a good predictive value in early diagnosis of ATAAD. The optimal cutoff value was 3.15 ng/ml, with an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.90-0.98, P < 0.01), sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 98%. The combined model of YAP, WBC count and D-Dimer exhibited an enhanced predictive power, with an AUC of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.98-1.00, P < 0.01). Serum YAP values at 12 h post-surgery provided the most accurate prediction of postoperative MAEs, with an optimal cutoff value of 3.60 ng/ml, an AUC of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.79-0.99, P < 0.01), and sensitivity and specificity of 88% and 82%, respectively. The serum YAP concentration is an early and sensitive serum bioindicator for distinguishing AAD from ACS. Moreover, the amount of postoperative circulating YAP is a robust indicator of postoperative MAEs."

He had a history of CoA repair and ventricular septal defect closure 17 years ago. Physical examination revealed elevated blood pressure. Initially, aortic dissection was suspected, but the actual diagnosis was pseudoaneurysm just distal to the left subclavian artery. Surgical intervention involved excision of the pseudoaneurysm and replacement with a new vascular graft via a dual approach of median sternotomy and left thoracotomy. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and follow-up imaging at one month showed satisfactory aortic morphology. This case underscores the critical role of precise imaging in differentiating pseudoaneurysms from other lesions in post-CoA repair patients. Pseudoaneurysms can present subtly yet carry substantial risks, making regular imaging follow-up essential for early detection and improved outcomes."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (A-AAD) with severe acute aortic regurgitation (AR) and coronary involvement is a potentially fatal condition that causes left ventricular volume overload and catastrophic acute myocardial infarction. We present the successful management of a patient using Impella 5.5 following cardiopulmonary arrest caused by A-AAD with severe acute AR and left main trunk (LMT) obstruction. A 50-year-old man presented with acute anterior chest pain. The patient subsequently experienced a cardiac arrest, and veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) was administered accordingly. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography indicated type A aortic dissection extending from the sinotubular junction to the left common iliac artery. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed inversion of the aortic flap into the left ventricular outflow tract, resulting in acute severe AR and LMT obstruction. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with A-AAD accompanied by severe acute AR and LMT obstruction. Emergent total arch replacement with a frozen elephant trunk (FET) was performed. However, the patient could not be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass owing to cardiogenic shock, necessitating the introduction of VA-ECMO. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure remained high at 22 mmHg. Subsequently, Impella 5.5 was introduced via a branch of the vascular graft to address the extensive myocardial damage due to preoperative LMT obstruction, acute AR-induced left ventricular volume overload, and increased afterload from VA-ECMO. The patient's cardiac function gradually improved. VA-ECMO and Impella 5.5 were weaned on postoperative day 8 and 20, respectively. However, three months postoperatively, a MitraClip was used to progress secondary mitral regurgitation associated with left ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction. The patient gradually recovered from the neurological deficit and was transferred for physical rehabilitation five months postoperatively. The patient exhibited severe cardiac dysfunction due to extensive myocardial infarction and acute AR from A-AAD. Retrograde perfusion via VA-ECMO was required for systemic organ perfusion but was expected to hinder cardiac recovery. This report demonstrates that Impella effectively aids the restoration of cardiac function in such desperate conditions."

She was discovered hunched over a table in her room, displaying reduced responsiveness and prompting an emergency call. Initially, her blood pressure was within 60 mmHg, and she was transported by ambulance to our hospital. Further examination revealed acute Stanford type A aortic dissection accompanied by signs of cardiac tamponade, necessitating urgent surgery. The operation was performed under general anesthesia and tracheal intubation. After exposing the femoral vessels through an incision in the right groin, cannulation was achieved for cardiopulmonary bypass. Subsequently, a median sternotomy was performed and the pericardium was opened. Blood within the pericardial cavity was carefully exposed and blood pressure was monitored. The pericardial cavity contained a large number of dark red hematomas. A left ventricular vent was inserted and cooling was initiated. The circulatory arrest was achieved at a rectal temperature of 28°C, accompanied by antegrade cerebral perfusion and selective antegrade myocardial protection to facilitate cardiac arrest. The entry tear was located on the dorsal aspect of the ascending aorta. Additionally, the ascending aorta was trimmed proximal to the brachiocephalic artery and a 26-mm Gelweave graft was anastomosed. Circulation was subsequently resumed, and rewarming commenced. The proximal dissection was extended to the non-coronary cusp, where BioGlue was applied to bond the intima and adventitia, followed by a partial adventitial inversion. The proximal anastomosis was then completed. The total operation duration was 366 min. The patient was extubated, and oral intake was initiated the following day. However, postoperative delirium persisted, and the patient developed a cerebral infarction triggered by paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Her daily activities declined, and she experienced complications including pneumonia and urinary tract infection, which responded to antibiotic therapy. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 49."

    "abstract": "The outcomes of cardiac surgery in patients with hematologic disorders are significantly worse. However, details of the clinical course of each hematologic disease remain unclear. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) presents with progressive pancytopenia that has the risk of infection, hemorrhage, and transformation to acute myelogenous leukemia. A 65-year-old woman who had a history of surgery for Stanford type A acute aortic dissection presented rapidly decreasing platelets and the appearance of erythroblasts in peripheral blood. A bone marrow biopsy was performed. The day after the biopsy, an impending rupture of the pseudoaneurysm at the graft anastomosis site was found accidentally by computed tomography. Although she underwent aortic root replacement, she had recurrent thrombocytopenia and anemia, along with unexpected bleeding complications after surgery. After she was diagnosed with high-risk MDS, the management was challenging, including the decision of the indication for blood transfusion and treatments for some complications. Ultimately, she died due to infection. This report provides valuable insights into the detailed postoperative course of cardiac surgery in a patient with high-risk MDS."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) is a medical emergency that occurs as a result of a compromise in the structural integrity of the aorta. If left untreated, AD can have severe consequences such as organ dysfunction or even death. Malperfusion syndrome is a major complication of aortic dissection with mesenteric malperfusion syndrome being a rare but devastating form that can lead to mesenteric ischemia and is associated with poor prognosis despite timely management. Here we report a case of a 31-year-old woman who was diagnosed with mesenteric ischemia secondary to incidental findings of aortic dissection whilst being investigated for ischemic hepatitis. She underwent emergency surgery to repair the aortic dissection but faced challenges due to unusual arterial vasculature. Despite best efforts, the patient's condition deteriorated, leading to severe brain injury. Management of aortic dissection complicated by mesenteric malperfusion remains a clinical challenge with high mortality rates and despite this, there is currently no definitive national guideline for the best management approach."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is the most common thoracic aortic emergency and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Initial complications are dependent on reduction of sheer stress against the aortic wall to protect against rupture and minimize progression of the aortic wall injury. In patients with dissection starting at or distal to the left subclavian artery (Stanford type B), initial management includes strict blood pressure and heart rate control with monitoring for any complications such as malperfusion, rupture, or hemodynamic instability. Following the acute dissection event, survivors are faced with the lifelong need for blood pressure control and surveillance imaging to monitor for potential aortic deterioration leading to rupture or aneurysm formation. This review will discuss the latest recommendations for current management of uncomplicated type B aortic dissection including the evolving role of endovascular therapies."

    "abstract": "Acute heart failure due to aortic regurgitation (AR) is a severe comorbidity of type A acute aortic dissection (AAD). Valve-sparing aortic root replacement is typically performed when the aortic valve remains intact. A 33-year-old male presented to our hospital with chest pain. Initial computed tomography (CT) scans did not clearly identify an aortic dissection. However, subsequent evaluations suggested acute coronary syndrome. Catheter angiography revealed difficulties in catheterizing the coronary arteries, and echocardiography detected aortic insufficiency. Electrocardiogram-gated CT angiography ultimately confirmed a localized aortic root dissection, necessitating urgent surgical intervention. The patient underwent valve reimplantation to preserve the aortic valve. The postoperative course was uneventful, with follow-up echocardiography and CT showing no residual dissection or regurgitation. This report highlights a case of acute aortic root dissection resulting in acute AR. The primary cause of AR in this case was the intussusception of the disrupted aortic intima. The dissection was confined solely to the aortic root. The patient underwent successful valve reimplantation, with no postoperative complications. Electrocardiogram-gated CT angiography and transesophageal echocardiography proved valuable in identifying localized aortic abnormalities with precision."

    "abstract": "An 86-year-old female presented to our emergency department with chest pain and orthopnea and was diagnosed with heart failure and ST-elevation myocardial infarction, prompting hospitalization. During hospitalization, she developed a fever. A chest and abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), conducted to investigate the cause of the fever, coincidentally revealed sedimentation of contrast agent in the descending aorta. To differentiate from aortic dissection, we conducted dynamic CT, and it was confirmed that the contrast agent within the aorta decreased over time. On the same day, an echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 36% with reduced contractile function, and a stagnant, hazy echo within the descending aorta. In aortic dissection, the retention of contrast agent in the false lumen of the aorta is a crucial finding for diagnosis. However, we experienced a case where contrast agent accumulated in the descending aorta, caused by low ejection fraction of the left ventricle. Differential diagnosis from aortic dissection may be possible due to the gradual decrease in contrast agent over time. This case is valuable to report given the limited number of previous reports on this phenomenon."

    "abstract": "Contrast-enhanced CT is a primary tool in emergency departments for diagnosing acute aortic dissection, demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity. However, artifacts such as streak artifacts can mimic aortic dissection, leading to misdiagnosis. Here, we report a case involving a 21-year-old male who sustained traumatic injuries after a motor vehicle accident. Initial contrast-enhanced CT indicated a possible localized dissection in the descending aorta. Conservative treatment was initiated under the presumption of aortic dissection. Upon re-evaluation with ECG-gated CT, the previously identified \"dissection\" artifact had disappeared, revealing no actual aortic injury. This case illustrates how heartbeat-induced streak artifacts, while commonly seen in the aortic root, can also manifest in the descending aorta. Our findings underscore the importance of considering artifacts in atypical cases of aortic dissection, particularly when findings are localized to areas of the aorta in close proximity to the heart. For trauma patients, while dynamic contrast-enhanced CT remains standard, ECG-gated CT should be selectively applied where motion artifacts are suspected. This case highlights the role of advanced imaging options in distinguishing between true aortic pathology and artifacts, aiding in appropriate clinical decision-making."

The long-term consequences on physical and mental well-being are largely unknown. The primary aim was to analyze self-reported Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and symptoms of anxiety and depression in patients with chronic TBAD. The secondary aim was to describe changes in physical and sexual activity following TBAD. This is a population-based cross-sectional survey study. All patients hospitalised with acute TBAD in Stockholm County 2017-2021, and alive on March 31, 2023, were invited to answer questionnaires on HRQoL (EQ-5D-5L, EQ VAS), anxiety (HADS-A), depression (HADS-D), physical activity (SED-GIH) and sexual activity (men: IIEF-5, women: FSFI-6). Out of 88 invited TBAD patients, 49 (56%) participated. Median age was 72 years (IQR 62-81) and 41% were women. The median time from the acute event to the questionnaire response was 42 months (IQR 27-60). The mean EQ VAS score was 62. The largest negative impacts on the participants health status were seen in the \"pain/discomfort\" (66% of participants), \"anxiety/depression\" (53%) and \"Mobility\" (45%) domains. Based on the HADS questionnaire, 20% had a score indicating symptoms of depression, whereas 14% had a score indicating symptoms of anxiety. Overall, 69% reported a change in physical activity and 42% reported a change in sexual activity. TBAD patients reported substantially reduced mental and physical well-being several years after the acute event. This new and important finding should be considered by health-care providers and in future follow-up protocols."

    "abstract": "The thoracic branch endoprosthesis (TBE) (W.L. Gore) offers an off-the-shelf single option for thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) of aortic arch pathology with sealing in zones 0 to 2. This study reports the early outcomes of TBE-TEVAR for acute indications. Clinical data, imaging, and outcomes of patients treated with TBE-TEVAR at seven institutions were retrospectively reviewed (March 2017 to March 2024). Patients treated for complicated aortic dissection, symptomatic aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm, or blunt traumatic aortic injury by urgent/emergent repair were included. End points were 30-day mortality, major adverse events (mortality, myocardial infarction, prolonged intubation, stroke, paraplegia, dialysis, or bowel ischemia), and technical success. Of 356 patients treated by TBE-TEVAR, 107 (69.0% male; mean age, 60 ± 15 years) underwent repair for acute indications including 70 dissections (65%), 21 symptomatic aneurysms/pseudoaneurysms (20%), and 16 blunt traumatic aortic injuries (15%). Eight patients (8%) had repair immediately after open ascending repair of a type A dissection. Proximal sealing was in zone 2 in 91 patients (89%) and zone 0 to 1 in 11 patients (11%) who required cervical debranching. Technical success was achieved in all (99%) except one patient with acute dissection and aneurysmal degeneration requiring staged repair. At 30 days, two patients (2%) died, and 19 patients (18%) developed major adverse events, including stroke in six patients (6%) and paraplegia in six patients (6%). Five patients (5%; all Zone 2) had retrograde dissections, all treated for acute or subacute dissection, with no mortality. Mean follow-up was 55 ± 171 days, and 96 patients (94%) had follow-up imaging. Type IA or III endoleak occurred in seven patients (7%), retrograde branch occlusion in one (1%), and eleven (10%) required reintervention. Cumulative aortic-related mortality was three (3%) from aortic rupture. Urgent/emergent TEVAR with the Gore TBE device in acute pathology offers low mortality, stroke, and paraplegia risk. Longer follow-up is needed to assess effectiveness of the repair."

The development of serious morbidity, especially neurological complications after the operation, remains a huge threat. We aimed to present comparatively the results of using unilateral or bilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion to minimize these threats and to demonstrate the postoperative effects of antegrade cerebral perfusion choices. Methods: The 147 patients who underwent emergency acute type A aortic dissection surgery between January 2018 and January 2023 were evaluated retrospectively. The patients were divided into two groups: those who underwent unilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion (Group 1) (n = 89) and those who underwent bilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion (Group 2) (n = 59). Baseline demographics, and preoperative, operative, and postoperative data of patients were compared statistically. Results: When the analyses of baseline demographics, and preoperative and operative data were evaluated, no significant difference was found between the groups. In addition, when comparing postoperative results, no statistical difference was found between the groups except for new-onset permanent neurological complications. The rate of postoperative new-onset permanent neurological complications was found to be 17.9% in group 1, where unilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion was applied, and 5.1% in group 2, where bilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion was applied, and this comparison was statistically significant. Conclusions: The competence of the Willis Polygon should not be relied upon without any evidence, and we believe that bilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion can be performed with a technique that does not compromise surgical comfort."

This study evaluates the clinical benefits of integrating a deep learning (DL)-based application for the automated detection and prioritization of AD on chest CT angiographies (CTAs) with a focus on the reduction in the scan-to-assessment time (STAT) and interpretation time (IT). This retrospective Multi-Reader Multi-Case (MRMC) study compared AD detection with and without artificial intelligence (AI) assistance. The ground truth was established by two U.S. board-certified radiologists, while three additional expert radiologists served as readers. Each reader assessed the same CTAs in two phases: assessment unaided by AI assistance (pre-AI arm) and, after a 1-month washout period, assessment aided by device outputs (post-AI arm). STAT and IT metrics were compared between the two arms. This study included 285 CTAs (95 per reader, per arm) with a mean patient age of 58.5 years ±14.7 (SD), of which 52% were male and 37% had a prevalence of AD. AI assistance significantly reduced the STAT for detecting 33 true positive AD cases from 15.84 min (95% CI: 13.37-18.31 min) without AI to 5.07 min (95% CI: 4.23-5.91 min) with AI, representing a 68% reduction (p < 0.01). The IT also reduced significantly from 21.22 s (95% CI: 19.87-22.58 s) without AI to 14.17 s (95% CI: 13.39-14.95 s) with AI (p < 0.05). The integration of a DL-based algorithm for AD detection on chest CTAs significantly reduces both the STAT and IT. By prioritizing urgent cases, the AI-assisted approach outperforms the standard First-In, First-Out (FIFO) workflow."

Initial examination showed mild hypertension, elevated bilirubin level, and leukocytosis. Imaging studies indicated gallbladder distension with cholelithiasis. Discharged with outpatient follow-up for elective cholecystectomy, the patient returned 2 days later for preoperative clearance, was hypertensive and tachycardic, presented with atrial flutter, and was referred to the emergency department. A 2D echo showed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 35% to 40% and pericardial effusion. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed LVEF 50% to 55% and no thrombus, converting to sinus rhythm postcardioversion. The TEE also suggested type A AD, confirmed by computed tomography (CT) angiography, showing dissection from the aortic valve to the left external iliac artery with pericardial effusion. Emergent surgical repair was performed, and the patient was stabilized and discharged with follow-up. This case illustrates the complexity of diagnosing and managing AD, especially with concurrent AF. Recognizing the association between AD and AF is essential as AF increases in-hospital mortality in AD patients."

This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of endovascular treatment of acute mesenteric occlusion first in stable patients with acute type A aortic dissection. The study was a single-center case series. Data collected from 11 consecutive patients over 12 years, from March 2010 to November 2022, were retrospectively analyzed. All were expeditiously escorted to the interventional suite via the prioritized green channel of the chest pain center and received the endovascular treatment of acute mesenteric occlusion first. Post-procedure, patients were promptly transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring and got standardized medication. After hospital discharge, patients underwent follow-up aortic computed tomography angiography (CTA) at 1 month, 6 months, and annually thereafter to ensure continuous monitoring of the patient's condition and timely identification of any potential complications. All patients were male, with a mean age of 49.5 years. Time from abdominal distension and pain onset to admission to the catheterization laboratory was 4-13 (mean 6.9) hours. Endovascular repair of the SMA was successfully completed with uneventful hospital courses in all patients. Bowel sounds weakened in 6 cases and disappeared in 5, while bloody stools occurred in 3 without intestinal necrosis. At 2-32 months follow-up, the patients had no abdominal pain, distension nor other signs of mesenteric artery ischemia. For patients with acute SMA occlusion caused by acute Stanford type A aortic dissection, endovascular treatment first to restore blood supply to the SMA appears feasible, safe and efficacious."

Thoracic endovascular aortic repair, i.e. stent-graft implantation into the ascending aortic graft, under rapid pacing was successfully performed. The graft flexion/stenosis was slightly improved, and the intraluminal protrusion of the lesser curvature was covered by the stent graft. Anemia was completely resolved.

    "abstract": "Medical management with anti-impulse therapy and imaging surveillance remains the standard of care for the majority of uncomplicated type B aortic dissections (uTBAD). Failure to adhere to surveillance recommendations may increase the likelihood of aortic degeneration and complications and affect long-term mortality. We sought to analyze adherence to imaging surveillance and identify risk factors for nonadherence in our practice. In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, demographics, follow-up, and outcomes of patients with acute or subacute uTBAD from August, 20211 to November, 2021 were analyzed. Outcomes were compared between patients with and without routine imaging surveillance. Imaging surveillance was defined as aorta-directed imaging with associated in-person or telephone encounter ≥3 months from index hospitalization. Univariate analysis was used to compare patients with and without imaging surveillance. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify factors related to increased odds of adherence to imaging surveillance. A total of 152 medically managed acute or subacute uTBAD patients were identified. Seventy (46.0%) patients underwent imaging surveillance for a median of 16 (interquartile range [IQR] 3.5-29) months. There were no differences in age, sex, race, insurance status, or smoking status between patients with and without surveillance. The median patient home address was 96.1 miles from our center, with no difference between the surveillance (85.7 [IQR 63.5-149.9]) versus no surveillance (106.7 [IQR 70.6-157.6]) groups (P = 0.32). Prior cardiovascular surgery (22.0% vs. 5.7%, P < 0.01) was more common in those without surveillance. Most patients (94.7%) presented as hospital transfers, with no difference between surveillance and non-surveillance groups (P = 0.15). Patients with surveillance were more likely to be discharged home (92.9% vs. 69.5%, P < 0.01). Postdischarge thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) occurred in 13.8% of patients and was more common in the surveillance group (25.7% vs. 3.7%, P < 0.01). In TEVAR patients, there was no difference between the rate of urgent or emergent intervention between (P = 1.00) and no difference in the median time to TEVAR (P = 0.15) for surveillance and nonsurveillance groups. Discharge home (OR 5.78, [95% confidence interval [CI] 1.86-17.95, P < 0.01]) was associated with greater odds of imaging surveillance adherence. Previous cardiovascular surgery (OR 0.21, [95% CI 0.06-0.73, P = 0.02]), history of drug use (OR 0.31, [95% CI 0.10-0.97, P = 0.05]), and age (0.96 per unit increase, [95% CI 0.93-0.99, P = 0.02]) were associated with lower odds of imaging surveillance. There was no difference in 5-year survival between groups (log-rank P = 0.26). Adherence to uTBAD imaging surveillance was low and did not vary by patient demographics or distance from hospital. Patients with imaging surveillance were more likely to undergo TEVAR, although there were no differences in 5-year all-cause survival between groups. Home discharge was associated with the greatest odds of imaging surveillance adherence. This study highlights the difficulty in regional referral center care coordination for treatment of medically managed uTBAD and identifies several factors that may help identify at-risk patients."

Clinical data were collected from 96 patients with acute type A aortic dissection admitted to our hospital from January 2020 to December 2022. The cohort comprised 61 males and 35 females, with an average age of 52 ± 9.57 years and a mean body weight of 79.54 ± 12.57 kg. The mean diameter of the LSA opening was 11.24 ± 1.48 mm, as measured by computer tomography angiography (CTA) of the thoracoabdominal aorta. All patients underwent emergency Sun's procedure. The surgical method for the LSA stump was selected based on the anatomical location, depth of the subclavian artery, vessel diameter, length of the free vessel, and extent of dissection. Techniques included the use of two Hem-o-lok clips, 5-0 prolene suture with one Hem-o-lok clip, and 5-0 prolene suture alone. All the patients successfully completed Sun's procedure as planned. Two Hem-o-lok clips were used to close the stump of the LSA in 38 cases. A combination of 5-0 prolene suture and one Hem-o-lok clip were used to close the stump of the LSA in 54 cases. The LSA stumps for 4 cases were closed with 5-0 prolene suture only. Postoperative complications included cerebral infarction in one patient, renal insufficiency in one patient, and gastrointestinal bleeding in one patient. There were no surgery-related deaths, no paraplegia,and all patients were successfully discharged. The 1-year follow-up CTA of the thoracoabdominal aorta demonstrated effective thrombosis of the false lumen in the stented segment of the thoracic aorta, no aneurysmal dilatation, and successful closure of the LSA stump. The simplified approach of Hem-o-lok closure of the LSA stump largely mitigates the difficulty in the LSA operation process,shortens the time of operation and reduces bleeding risk, thus effectively improving a patient's prognosis and yielding satisfactory clinical outcomes."

A total of 342 AAD patients transported by HEMS were analyzed, excluding those with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Patients were categorized based on whether HEMS was requested using a keyword method or after initial GEMS contact. We compared the groups on time intervals, prehospital interventions, and outcomes including Cerebral Performance Category. The time from GEMS awareness to HEMS contact was significantly shorter in the keyword methods group compared with the control group (median 27 vs. 33 minutes, respectively; P < .001). No significant difference was observed in the time from contact to departure from the scene. Patient characteristics, vital signs at HEMS staff contact, and medical interventions provided by HEMS staff showed no statistically significant differences. Changes in vital signs from HEMS staff contact to hospital arrival included a significant decrease in the respiratory rate and systolic blood pressure. Patients in the keyword methods group had a significantly higher proportion of favorable outcomes in terms of Cerebral Performance Category compared with the control group (77.2% vs. 66.5%, P = .03). However, logistic analysis did not show significant differences (odds ratio = 1.007; 95% confidence interval, 0.987-1.016; P = .814). Keyword methods for early HEMS requests may appear to reduce time to specialty care and suggest improvement of outcomes for patients with AAD."

    "title": "FSTL1 protects against acute aortic dissection by suppressing vascular smooth muscle cell phenotypic switching and degradation of the extracellular matrix.",
    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a life-threatening cardiovascular emergency, which is closely related to the vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) phenotypic switching and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Previous studies have found that the secreted extracellular glycoprotein Follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1) is demonstrated as a protective factor for cardiovascular diseases. However, the role of FSTL1 in AAD remains elusive. We aimed to investigate whether FSTL1 could regulate VSMCs phenotypic switching and ECM degradation in AAD. Firstly, we found that FSTL1 expression in aorta was significantly decreased in human AAD examined by western blot and immunohistochemical staining. Then we established a mouse AAD model by administering β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) dissolved in drinking water for 28 days. We found that FSTL1 expression in aorta was also decreased in mouse AAD. Exogenous supplement with recombinant human FSTL1 protein could rescue VSMCs phenotypic switching and ECM degradation to reduce the occurrence and progression of mouse AAD. In vitro, FSTL1 protein and adenovirus overexpressing FSTL1 (ad-FSTL1) reversed the primary VSMCs phenotypic switching and decreased the expression of MMP2 induced by PDGF-BB. Knocking down FSTL1 initiates VSMCs phenotypic switching and increases the expression of MMP2. In terms of mechanisms, AMPK phosphorylation was decreased and could be improved by FSTL1 protein in mouse AAD. FSTL1 protein and ad-FSTL1 reversed the decreased AMPK phosphorylation induced by PDGF-BB in primary VSMCs. These findings indicate that FSTL1 protects against VSMCs phenotypic switching and ECM degradation in AAD, and targeting FSTL1 may be a potential new strategy for prevention and treatment of AAD."

    "title": "Neurological Manifestations of Aortic Dissection: A Scoping Review.",
    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) is the most prevalent aortic pathology, with an incidence of 2.6-3.5 cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year with mortality rates as high as 90% at 3 months without proper management. Despite the presence of typical symptoms, it has been reported that up to 38% of cases go unnoticed in the initial evaluation, either due to additional symptomatology or the absence of classic symptoms. In 28% of cases the diagnosis is made post-mortem, highlighting the severity and importance of timely diagnosis. The main goals of this study were to identify the primary neurological manifestations of acute AD and the frequency of these manifestations in type A and B AD according to the Stanford classification. A total of 2,734 records were retrieved from two databases, of which 2,611 were excluded. Therefore, 123 articles were obtained and 88 were evaluated for eligibility. Consequently, 79 articles were included in the review. The abstracts identified in the search were screened by seven blinded independent authors and excluded those who lacked relevance. The authors read the full texts independently to determine inclusion. A third reviewer adjudicated discrepancies when opinions were at odds. There were 169 patients diagnosed with Stanford type A, of which 43.8% displayed quantitative impairment of consciousness. Within this group, transient loss of consciousness was observed in 34.3% of cases. Motor syndrome was present in 54.5%, with 23.7% of patients presenting with hemiparesis or hemiplegia. 3.6% had facial paresis or paralysis and less frequently monoparesis, paraparesis, hyperreflexia, spasticity, and muscle spasms. 7.6% presented with language impairments including Broca's aphasia and dysarthria. Seizures were present in 3.6%. Neuro-ophthalmological symptoms were 2.9%, cortical or cognitive symptoms and headache were 2.3%, cerebellar syndrome was 1.8%, and sensory syndrome was 1.2%. Of 86 patients diagnosed with Stanford type B, 57.0% displayed motor syndrome, with 50.0% being paraparesis or paraplegia, 4.7% monoplegia, and 2.3% hemiplegia or hemiparesis. Additionally, impairment of consciousness was present in 26.7%, sensory syndrome in 12.8%, and language impairments in 3.5%. In the emergency department, understanding the neurological manifestations in both Stanford type A and B dissections emerges as a pivotal cornerstone for conducting precise assessments and efficient patient management. Given the wide spectrum of manifestations, we emphasize the importance of suspecting AD when neurological disorders are associated with the classic symptoms. In these cases, we encourage a complete neurological examination to be performed and a multidisciplinary group assembled to tackle this entity."

    "abstract": "Acute Type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) represents a life-threatening medical emergency that requires emergent surgical repair. Despite improvement in surgical techniques and perioperative management, ATAAD remains associated with high early mortality and postoperative complications. A structured and individualized postoperative surveillance program is essential, not only for improving survival rates but also for identifying risk factors necessitating reintervention and enhancing the quality of life. Comprehensive postoperative care should address both medical monitoring and psychological support to meet the holistic needs of ATAAD survivors. In real-world settings adherence to guideline-directed imaging surveillance (GDIS) is poor, leading to underestimation of reintervention rates. A comprehensive aortic service should include GDIS, clinical assessments, cardiovascular risk management, and psychological support. Since August 2022, a virtual ward has been implemented in our department to facilitate remote monitoring, ensuring tight blood pressure control and early detection of complications."

The prognosis remains serious, particularly when the ascending aorta is involved (type A AD), therefore immediate surgical treatment can considerably reduce its mortality. The prognosis for dissections of the descending thoracic aorta (type B) is the best; treatment is primarily medical in the absence of complications. We report two cases of unexploited Stanford type A aortic dissection respectively in a 38-year-old patient and a 52-year-old patient, both with a fatal outcome, and two case of type B aortic dissection with a favorable outcome. These observations highlight the need to raise awareness among our populations about cardiovascular emergencies and challenge our health policies in order to improve the technical platform concerning the diagnosis and management of these dissections.

Studies have proven that less aggressive surgical treatments influence the outcome for female patients in the fields of several diseases. The purpose of this study was to report and analyze our results in the selective cohort of female patients with AADA to detect differences in the treatment of this group of patients.MethodsBetween January 2000 and July 2018, 141 adult female patients with acute aortic dissection (AAD) underwent repair of the aorta in our department. A total of 75 patients received a proximal arch. replacement (group A), and 66 patients received a subtotal (replacement of the brachiocephalic trunk) and/or total arch. replacement with elephant trunk or frozen elephant trunk (group B).ResultsThe median age in group A was 70.7 years (range 60.7-74.7 years) and in group B 66.3 years (range 55.6-71.3 years). Operation times were significantly longer in group B (total operation time: A = 286.9 min (range 225.0-341.0 min), B = 341 min (range 266.0-392 min), p = .003; cardiopulmonary bypass time: A = 189.0 min (range 139.0-138 min), B = 238 min (range 176.8-300.5 min), p < .001; circulatory arrest time: A = 27.0 min (range 21.0-37.0 min), B = 42.0 min (range 32.0-56.3 min), p < .001). There were no significant differences between the groups regarding 30-day mortality (A = 24% (n = 18), B = 19.7% (n = 13), p = .538) and rate of reoperation (A = 13.3% (n = 10), B = 15.2% (n = 10), p = .757) or the preoperative characteristics.ConclusionOur study showed no significant difference in mortality rate depending on the type of operation. Based on these results, a proximal arch. replacement should be considered as the first line of operation technique if the individual situation allows. For inexperienced clinics and surgeons in particular, we recommend limited aortic repair in patients with AADA. Finally, location of the intimal tear remains the essential factor for the evaluation of the surgical treat."

    "abstract": "Re-do root replacement poses a significant technical challenge, increasing the potential risk of morbidity and mortality. This multi-institution study compared the outcomes of aortic root replacement stratified by chest surgery and aortic root history. A retrospective review by the Western Aortic Collaborative was performed of 3 different aortic centers for patients who underwent nonemergency root replacement from 2017 to 2023 with exclusion of patients who underwent more than hemiarch replacement or presented with acute or hyperacute aortic dissection. Patients were stratified into 3 cohorts: native chest, prior sternotomy with no previous root replacement, and true re-do root replacement. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression was performed for the primary end point of in-hospital or 30-day mortality and secondary end points. A total of 568 patients underwent elective or urgent root replacement, with 338 (59.5%) in the native chest cohort, 165 (29.1%) in the no previous root replacement cohort, and 65 (11.4%) in the true re-do root replacement cohort. The no previous root replacement and true re-do root replacement cohorts were more likely to undergo nonvalve-sparing root replacement (P < .001) and concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (P = .002) and less likely to undergo hemiarch repair (P < .001). Multivariable analysis showed additional risk associated with prior sternotomy, rather than having a previous root performed. Patients undergoing root replacement in a non-native chest have a significant risk of morbidity and mortality. However, prior root and true re-do root replacement do not appear to add additional risk, with primary risk contributed by operating in a prior surgical field."

Initially, a presurgical echocardiogram showed insignificant PFO shunting; however, severe hypoxemia and inability to extubate after thoracic aortic dissection repair necessitated further investigation. A repeat transesophageal echocardiogram after cardiothoracic surgery revealed significant PFO elongation with bidirectional shunting. Subsequent urgent transcatheter PFO closure markedly improved oxygenation, allowing for successful weaning from mechanical ventilation.

The patient was promptly diagnosed with an ascending aortic aneurysm and dissection, and an emergency Bentall procedure in deep hypothermic circulatory arrest was performed. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first Stanford A dissection case described in the literature in a patient with Starr-Edwards valve, and the longest still functioning caged-ball valve to have been replaced with the Bentall procedure. We also discuss the caged-ball valve's unfavorable hemodynamics as a potential predisposing factor of the dissection, as well as the patient's supposed initial bicuspid aortic valve disease which could also predispose to aortic aneurysm formation and dissection."

We compared the effects on outcomes of single arterial cannulation (SAC) via axillary, femoral, or ascending aorta with double arterial cannulation (DAC) via axillary and femoral artery during ATAAD repair. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies from PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE, and Cochrane searches through April 30, 2024. Dichotomous data were pooled using risk ratio (RR), and continuous data were pooled using mean difference (MD), both with a 95% confidence interval (CI), using R version 4.3. The protocol is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024535644). Our analysis included 7 studies encompassing 3,534 patients. DAC was associated with a significantly longer intensive care unit stay than SAC (MD 0.45 days, 95% CI 0.10, 0.79, p = 0.01). However, there was no significant difference between DAC and SAC in the length of hospital stay (MD 1.39 days, 95% CI -2.70, 5.47, p = 0.51). Also, there was no significant difference between the two approaches in the incidence of stroke (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.77, 1.64, p = 0.55), paraplegia (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.32, 1.07, p = 0.08), or acute kidney injury (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.55, 1.24, p = 1.24). Our meta-analysis shows that during ATAAD repair, DAC was associated with slightly longer intensive care stay, which was of doubtful clinical significance. However, both approaches were comparable for hospital stay, the incidence of stroke, paraplegia, or acute kidney injury. Despite comparable overall outcomes, we observed that DAC was associated with higher risks of requiring continuous renal replacement therapy or dialysis, and reintubation. This emphasizes the need to carefully consider cannulation strategies based on patient factors to balance potential benefits and risks."

This syndrome encompasses a group of four acute aortic conditions: aortic dissection (AD), intramural hematoma, penetrating aortic ulcer, and incomplete dissection. Aortic dissection usually follows the sudden onset of acute chest pain, which is worse at the point of manifestation. 50-year-old male patient admitted to the emergency department for abdominal pain; he reported a history of systemic arterial hypertension for 22 years of diagnosis, treatment with Irbesartan (225 mg/day), chronic kidney disease without replacement therapy, with previous appendectomy 30 years ago. The diagnostic difficulty of acute aortic syndrome in the emergency department has been a challenge due to the diffuse clinical picture in which it presents, but it is extremely important to have a high level of suspicion, to keep in mind that AD is an underdiagnosed etiology and to relate it to risk factors.

Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial due to the wide range of underlying causes, such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS), pulmonary embolism (PE), aortic dissection, and others. Misdiagnosis can lead to missed life-saving interventions or, alternatively, unnecessary hospitalizations, escalating healthcare costs. While risk stratification tools like the HEART, GRACE, and TIMI scores are useful, additional imaging is often required to achieve diagnostic precision. Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) has shown significant potential in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and improving patient outcomes. In this review, we explore the challenges physicians encounter when evaluating ACP in the ED, emphasizing the utility of CCTA as a key diagnostic tool.

    "abstract": "This article explores the challenges in diagnosing dysphagia aortica through the case of an 89-year-old man with a medical history of hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and chronic kidney disease. Over a three-month period, the patient experienced progressively worsening dysphagia and indigestion. On the day of presentation, his condition further deteriorated, marked by hypotension. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) identified a large infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring 13 cm, which was later confirmed by CT to involve dissection and a contained rupture. This case highlights the rare presentation of dysphagia secondary to an infrarenal AAA, known as dysphagia aortica, emphasizing the importance of considering AAAs in elderly patients with vague gastrointestinal symptoms. Despite prompt diagnosis and referral for vascular surgery, the patient's prognosis was poor due to advanced age, frailty, and multiple comorbidities. Unfortunately, he passed away a few hours after presenting to the emergency department. This article underscores the critical role of imaging modalities such as POCUS and CT in identifying life-threatening conditions like AAAs, and it advocates for a comprehensive differential diagnosis in older adults while also serving as a reminder of the atypical presentations of AAAs."

The aim of this study was to assess the available literature on TEVAR confined to the ascending aorta (a-TEVAR), describing study and patient characteristics, procedural and stent graft details, and outcomes. This was a systematic review and meta-analysis. MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Scopus were systematically searched for eligible studies reporting on outcomes after a-TEVAR (PROSPERO ID: CRD42023440826). Eligible studies reported outcomes after a-TEVAR without adjunctive supra-aortic vessel treatment. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was followed. The ROBINS-I and Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist were used as quality assessment tools. A Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) evidence certainty analysis was performed for the main outcomes. The main outcome was death. A proportional meta-analysis was performed with a mean and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the main outcomes. All articles were included up to 1 January 2024. Ninety four studies were included (19 cohort studies, 75 case reports or series), reporting on 259 patients (57.8% male). The mean age was 69.1 (95% CI 65.0 - 73.1) years and mean follow up 19.6 (95% CI 14.5 - 24.6) months. The most common comorbidity was prior cardiac or thoracic surgery (n = 191). The most frequent indications for a-TEVAR (52.1% urgent a-TEVAR) were type A aortic dissection (43.6%) and pseudoaneurysm (38.6%). The most commonly deployed stent grafts were Gore (44.5%), Cook (23.5%), and Medtronic (17.0%). The in hospital mortality rate was 7.3% (95% CI 4.7 - 11.2%), 30 day mortality rate 7.7% (95% CI 5.1 - 11.6%), and overall mortality rate 17.0% (95% CI 12.9 - 22.0%) during follow up. GRADE showed very low evidence certainty for all outcomes. Eighty eight complications were reported and there was a re-operation rate of 13.1% (95% CI 9.5 - 17.8%). In hospital and 30 day mortality rates for type A dissection were 12.4% (95% CI 7.5 - 19.7%) (n = 14) and 13.3% (95% CI 8.2 - 20.8%) (n = 15), respectively, and for pseudoaneurysm 4.0% (95% CI 1.6 - 9.8%) (n = 4) and 4.0% (95% CI 1.6 - 9.8) (n = 4), respectively. Despite heterogeneous literature and very low GRADE evidence certainty, a-TEVAR seems technically feasible in high risk patients. In addition, there is need for a consensus on when and how to use a-TEVAR and a need for a specific endograft for use in the ascending aorta."

A 60-year-old male presented to the emergency department with acute lumbar pain and, based on contrast-enhanced computed tomography, was diagnosed with Stanford type A aortic dissection. Emergency surgery was performed. Transesophageal echocardiography during the surgery did not reveal an aorto-right atrial fistula. After establishing cardiopulmonary bypass, circulatory arrest was induced, and the primary entry in the proximal ascending aorta for the aortic dissection was identified. The aorta was dissected between the right brachiocephalic artery and the left common carotid artery, and an artificial conduit was anastomosed. After re-establishing circulation, venous blood flow from the dissected area at the base of the aortic root was observed, indicating communication between the aorta and the right atrium. Circulatory arrest was induced again, and the ruptured outer aortic adventitia was repaired by continuous suturing using 5-0 prolene. The atrial fistula was repaired from within the right atrium using 5-0 prolene with felt reinforcement. Thus, successful closure was achieved. Proximal anastomosis and right brachiocephalic artery reconstruction were subsequently performed. Postoperative transesophageal echocardiography revealed no shunt flow and no bleeding from the aortic root. The patient recovered smoothly and was discharged without significant complications. Aorto-right atrial fistula associated with Stanford type A aortic dissection is rare, and in this case, the shunt blood flow was low, making preoperative diagnosis difficult. However, after intraoperative diagnosis, direct suture was used to complete the treatment, which was a simple and effective method."

Bronchial artery angiography revealed that this rare disease in about 1% of patients. BAA is fatal if ruptured since there is no correlation between the diameter and symptoms of the aneurysm and the risk of rupture. Early treatment on diagnosis is desirable. Bronchial artery embolization (BAE) is the first choice for treatment because of its minimally invasive nature. A 74-year-old man was referred to our department and pointed out a tumor-like lesion under the aortic arch on a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT). We diagnosed it as a mediastinal BAA, and BAE was planned. The bronchial artery arising from the aorta showed strong atherosclerotic meanders and was difficult to engage, resulting in iatrogenic acute aortic dissection (AAD). Urgent thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) was performed. There was no contrast effect of the aneurysm on a postoperative CECT, indicating thrombotic occlusion. We were preparing a system that could convert to surgery or TEVAR, in case of difficult to treat with BAE or ruptured aneurysm during BAE, so we were able to respond quickly to aortic dissection caused by BAE and obtain a good result of both BAA and aortic dissection. TEVAR would be considered a treatment of BAA, in cases such as the present case, where engagement is difficult, where the length of the inflow artery is short, or where the inflow artery is tortuous."

When looking at patients with chest pain cases of acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism and aortic dissection account for the majority of cases that involve an allegation of malpractice. While it is likely impossible to catch all these cases having a structured approach to these patients may improve outcomes for both patients and clinicians."

    "abstract": "A female in late adolescence with severe chest pain, dyspnoea, diaphoresis and dizziness presented to the emergency department where she was found to have exceptionally high blood pressure (250/150 mm Hg) and a diastolic murmur. Initial examinations showed left ventricular hypertrophy, and urgent CT angiography confirmed a Stanford type A aortic dissection. Following successful surgical repair, further evaluations were prompted by her persistent, drug-resistant hypertension, revealing elevated normetanephrine and 3-methoxytyramine. Subsequent imaging identified bilateral pelvic paragangliomas, which were surgically removed, significantly reducing her hypertension. Her postoperative period showed biochemical remission, and genetic testing was positive for germline SDHB mutation. Monitoring and follow-up imaging are ongoing. This case highlights the rare association of pelvic paragangliomas with acute aortic dissection in young adults, emphasising the importance of possible endocrine hypertension in young people with hypertensive emergencies."

A 48-year-old woman with Marfan's syndrome presented to our hospital with fever, nausea, and general fatigue. She had previously undergone a mechanical Bentall procedure and total aortic arch replacement for acute type A aortic dissection. E tarda was identified from the blood culture. Computed tomography scanning revealed a mycotic aneurysm of the dissecting descending aorta. Despite appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy, the aneurysm dilated rapidly. Thus, an emergency surgery was performed to replace the descending aorta with a graft that was surrounded by a latissimus dorsi muscle flap. Her postoperative course was uneventful."

Rarely, such dissections can propagate into the ascending aorta, which may then require surgical intervention. We present the case of a 50-year-old patient with new-onset angina and two-vessel coronary artery disease who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention on the right coronary artery, complicated by an iatrogenic coronary dissection extending into the ascending aorta. A decision was taken to perform emergent cardiac surgery due to ongoing chest pain and the extent of the dissection. Computed tomography after surgery revealed no signs of aortic dissection with normal dimensions in all aortic segments. The patient was discharged home in a stable condition."

A total of 115 patients with aortic arch conditions treated with ISNF during TEVAR between January 2018 and December 2021 were incorporated. The median age of the patients was 62.0 years, and 10.4% (12/115) were female. The median follow-up time was 31.0 months. A total of 175 supra-arch branches were reconstructed. A single branch was fenestrated in 80 patients, while the left subclavian artery (LSA) and left common carotid artery (LCCA) were fenestrated simultaneously in 11 patients, and all supra-arch branches were fenestrated in 24 patients. The rate of technical success was 100%, 30-day mortality was 3.5% (4/115), overall mortality was 8.7% (10/115), and aortic-related mortality was 2.6% (3/115). Aortic-related reintervention was required in 7.8% (9/115) of patients. Among the major postoperative complications, four patients developed retrograde type A dissection requiring emergent open surgery, three patients had cerebrovascular accidents, and one patient had an endoleak. No occlusions or stenoses of the main or branch aortic stents were observed. The mid-term results of the ISNF technique during TEVAR for aortic arch conditions were within the acceptable range; however, further follow-up results are needed and long-term stability and durability needs to be assessed. Related fenestration devices also require further development."

A 39-year-old man without any medical history was admitted to the hospital with chest pain. Physical examination revealed a holosystolic murmur and a noticeable blood pressure difference between the upper and lower extremities. Imaging studies unveiled the presence of aortic dissection, aortic coarctation, and a bicuspid aortic valve. The patient underwent an urgent single-stage surgical intervention performed via a median sternotomy approach: the procedure involved patch angioplasty, a mechanical prosthetic valve, and a Dacron tube graft. The patient's follow-up assessments indicated successful outcomes. This case report highlights the complexity of managing concurrent pathologies, suggests a unique surgical approach, and underscores the importance of tailored interventions in rare presentations of cardiovascular diseases."

    "abstract": "Acute Stanford Type A Aortic Dissection (ATAAD) is a critical medical emergency characterized by significant morbidity and mortality. This study aims to identify specific gene expression patterns and RNA modification associated with ATAAD. The GSE153434 dataset was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differential expression analysis was conducted to identify differential expression genes (DEGs) associated with ATAAD. To validate the involvement of RNA modification in ATAAD, RNA modification-related genes (M6A, M1A, M5C, APA, A-to-I) were acquired from GeneCards, following by Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analysis. A gene prediction signature consisting of key genes was established, and Real-time PCR was used to validate the gene expression in clinical samples. The patients were then divided into high and low-risk groups, and subsequent enrichment analysis, including Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), and assessments of immune infiltration. A co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to explore gene-phenotype relationships and identify key genes. A total of 45 RNA modification genes were acquired. Six gene signatures (YTHDC1, WTAP, CFI, ADARB1, ADARB2, TET3) were developed for ATAAD diagnosis and risk stratification. Enrichment analysis suggested the potential involvement of inflammation and extracellular matrix pathways in the progression of ATAAD. The incorporation of pertinent genes from the GSE147026 dataset into the six-gene signature further validated the model's effectiveness. A significant upregulation in WTAP, ADARB2, and TET3 expression, whereas YTHDC1 exhibited a noteworthy downregulation in the ATAAD group. Six-gene signature could serve as an efficient model for predicting the diagnosis of ATAAD."

    "abstract": "This study aims to assess the safety, efficacy, and esthetic outcomes of an innovative 4 cm right infra-axillary incision approach for concomitant ascending aorta and aortic valve replacement (AAR and AVR), with a specific focus on achieving optimal surgical outcomes while ensuring minimal visible scarring. We retrospectively examined all elective cases of concomitant AAR and AVR surgery performed at our institution from July 2021 to June 2023. Exclusions encompassed emergency surgery, acute type A aortic dissection, active aortic valve endocarditis, redo cardiac surgery, the necessity for concurrent mitral valve replacement, or left ventricular assist device implantation. We collected and analyzed perioperative data for the patients. The study comprised 24 consecutive patients. Cardiopulmonary bypass time and aortic cross-clamp time averaged 215.0 (interquartile range [IQR], 38.0) and 158.0 (IQR, 37.0) min, respectively. No instances of reoperation due to postoperative bleeding or need for permanent pacemaker implantation were recorded. Initial 24-h postoperative drainage volume averaged 186.9 ± 76.9 mL. Average follow-up duration was 21.7 ± 6.2 months (range, 5 to 30 months). Throughout short-term follow-up, no occurrences of valve dysfunction, paravalvular leak, cardiovascular events necessitating readmission, or mortality were observed. The right infra-axillary incision approach effectively yields secure, successful, and cosmetically pleasing outcomes for concomitant AAR and AVR. Further research and comparisons are warranted to validate these findings."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic syndrome (AAS) requires urgent diagnosis with computed tomographic angiography (CTA). Diagnostic strategies need to weigh the benefits of detecting AAS against the costs of using CTA with a low yield of AAS when the prevalence of AAS is low. We aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies using clinical probability scoring and D-dimer to select patients with potential symptoms of AAS for CTA. We developed a decision analytical model to simulate the management of patients attending hospital with possible AAS. We modelled diagnostic strategies that used the Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score (ADD-RS) and D-dimer to select patients for CTA. We used estimates from our meta-analysis, existing literature and clinical experts to model the consequences of diagnostic strategies on survival, health utility, and health and social care costs. We estimated the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-years gained by each strategy compared with the next most effective alternative on the efficiency frontier. A strategy based on the Canadian guideline (CTA if ADD-RS>1 or ADD-RS=1 with D-dimer >500 ng/mL) is cost-effective but would result in high rates of CTA if applied to an unselected population (AAS prevalence 0.26%). The strategy is also cost-effective and would result in lower rates of CTA if applied to a more selected population, such as those with a non-zero clinical suspicion of AAS (prevalence 0.61%). For patients currently receiving CTA, using ADD-RS>1 or D-dimer >500 ng/mL to select patients for CTA is cost-effective. A strategy using ADD-RS>1 or ADD-RS=1 with D-dimer >500 ng/mL to select patients for CTA appears cost-effective but primary research is required to evaluate this strategy in practice and determine how suspicion of AAS is identified."

A total of 154 (41.2%) patients had total arch replacement (TAR), whereas 220 (58.8%) had hemi- or partial arch replacement (PAR).Operative mortality did not show a significant difference (7.7% in PAR, 13.0% in TAR, p = 0.096). Survival at 5 years showed no difference (77.8% in TAR, 72.6% in PAR, p = 0.14). Freedom from reoperations and reinterventions, as well as composite aortic events in the distal aorta, were comparable across groups (p = 0.21, 0.84, and 0.91, respectively). The inverse probability of treatment weighting-adjusted model displayed higher 5-year freedom from reoperations and aortic events in the TAR group (p = 0.029 and 0.054, respectively).The extent of arch replacement is determined based on the patient background, making it difficult to compare the superiority of both surgical methods. However, TAR for appropriately selected patients may provide the benefit of avoiding aortic events in the long term."

    "abstract": "In the setting of acute aortic syndromes, timely access to definitive surgical repair is of paramount importance. Older patients, primarily septuagenarians and octogenarians, undergoing emergent ascending arch repair experience higher rates of mortality compared to younger patients. Despite this risk, studies show that surgical management is still superior to medical management for this patient population. The objective of this study is to determine if older age impacts the time from presentation to the start of surgery for patients with acute aortic syndromes undergoing surgical repair. This retrospective review included all patients with acute aortic syndromes who underwent emergent ascending aortic arch repair from January 2018 to May 2023 at a single academic institution. Our analysis compared outcomes for older patients (age 70 years and older) with younger patients (age less than 70 years). Primary outcomes included 30-day mortality, postoperative stay, time from emergency department presentation to the start of surgery, and time from diagnosis with computed tomography to the start of surgery. Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications. Outcomes were analyzed using chi-squared and Student's t-tests, with significance set at p<0.05. Of 107 patients included (male, N=57), 71 (66%) were under the age of 70 and 36 (34%) were 70 years of age or older. The younger cohort had more male and non-White patients, with no differences in rates of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and smoking history. With no difference in the rate of transfers from outside hospitals, we observed longer times from presentation to the start of surgery for older patients compared to younger patients (7 hours and 13 minutes vs. 6 hours 25 minutes; p=0.02) and also for time of diagnosis to the start of surgery (4 hours 22 minutes vs. 3 hours 54 minutes; p=0.006). Older patients had higher rates of intraoperative (0% vs. 17%, p<0.001) and 30-day (7% vs. 44%, p<0.001) mortality. There were no differences in length of stay or in rates of postoperative complications and surgery-related emergency department visits. Patients aged 70 and older experienced delays from the time of presentation to the start of surgery and from time of diagnosis to the start of surgery. Age should not delay an individual from receiving timely transfer to a tertiary center for a higher level of care to better assess the patient's operative candidacy and determine appropriate treatment."

    "abstract": "The current economic burden of cardiovascular (CV)-related hospitalizations grouped by diagnoses and procedures in the United States has not been well characterized. The objective was to identify current trends in CV-related hospitalizations, procedural utilization, and health care costs using the most recent 6 years of hospitalization data. A retrospective analysis of discharge data from the National Inpatient Sample database was conducted to determine trends in CV-related hospitalizations, costs, and procedures for each year from 2016 to the most recent available dataset, 2021. Total CV-related costs were adjusted to and reported in 2023 dollars. In 2021, there were 4,687,370 CV-related hospitalizations at a cost of $108 billion. Heart failure hospitalizations accounted for the highest costs at $18.5 billion, followed by non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction at $11.2 billion and stroke at $10.9 billion. Significant upward trends in costs from 2016 to 2021 were observed for heart failure, stroke, atrial fibrillation, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, chest pain, hypertensive emergency, ventricular tachycardia, aortic dissection, sudden cardiac death, pericarditis, supraventricular tachycardia, and pulmonary heart disease. Over the 6 observational years, total costs increased by over $10 billion, representing a 10% increase. However, the increases were not linear, as there was a significant increase of 6.5% from 2018 to 2019, then a decrease of over 7% from 2019 to 2020, followed by an increase of approximately 6% from 2020 to 2021. By 2030, total CV-related costs are projected to reach $131.3 billion. For all years, coronary procedures were the most performed, followed by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, non-bypass peripheral vascular surgery, pacemaker placement, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Both transcatheter aortic valve replacement and MitraClip procedures demonstrated significant upward trends from 2016 to 2021. Overall, from the years 2016 to 2021, CV-related hospitalizations, costs, and procedures demonstrated upward trends. In conclusion, CV disease remains a high burden in the hospital setting with tremendous health care costs."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome is named after Antoine Marfan, who described a 5-year-old child with congenital elongation of the digits and other skeletal abnormalities in 1896. While Marfan syndrome is a systemic connective tissue disorder predominantly involving the skeletal, cardiovascular, and ocular systems, the cardiovascular system presents the most life-threatening complications. Most cardiovascular pathologies surround the left ventricular outflow tract and aorta, with aortic dissection requiring emergent surgical management to the progression of mitral regurgitation requiring elective surgery. Intensive care management, along with a tailored approach to the surgical management of a patient with Marfan syndrome, is critical to their survival. Current surgical operations for patients include aortic root surgery, valve-sparing root replacements, aortic root replacements with conduits, and mitral valve repairs. Further research is necessary to determine the molecular, endovascular, pharmaceutical, and surgical management of Marfan syndrome. This review attempts to concisely discuss the diagnosis, complications, and medical and intensive care management of Marfan syndrome while further divulging on the surgical management of those with this disease process."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the early and mid-term clinical outcomes after aortic root repair or replacement, and to provide a theoretical basis for such patients. The study included 442 consecutive patients with ATAAD who underwent aortic root repair [n=227, repair group (RG)] or the Bentall procedure [n=215, Bentall group (BG)] at our hospital between December 2018 and December 2021. The indications for aortic root replacement were aortic root sinus diameter of ≥4.5 cm, severe sinotubular junction involvement, unrepairable aortic valvulopathy, severe coronary ostium involvement, connective tissue disease, intimal tear at the aortic root, or dissection involving three aortic sinuses. The primary outcome was the survival rate and incidence of reoperation between the two groups. The in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates in the RG and BG were 10.1% and 11.6%, respectively. The two groups had no significant difference (P=0.613). Multivariate logistic analysis showed that aortic root surgery did not influence the in-hospital or 30-day mortality rates. The mean follow-up time was 36.8±11.6 months (median, 33.4 months; interquartile range, 27.0-45.2 months). The 5-year survival rates for the RG and BG were 88.1% and 85.9%, respectively (P=0.650). During the follow-up period, only one patient in the BG group underwent proximal aortic reoperation. Continuous improvement of aortic root repair technology and identification of its indications may help reduce reoperation rates. Aortic root repair can be considered safe and feasible."

This study aimed to identify the optimal oxygenation treatment for AAD patients with hypoxemia in the emergency department (ED). This was a retrospective, observational, cohort study. We retrospectively collected data from 187 adult patients with AAD and hypoxemia who had been admitted to our ED. All patients were divided into nasal cannula group (n=91), Venturi mask group (n=60), and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) group (n=36). The primary outcome was overall mortality in ED; the secondary outcomes were preoperative intubation rate and postoperative mortality, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, length of hospital stay, and length of intubation. Among all patients, those who received NIPPV treatment showed the lowest ED intubation rate (2.78%, P=0.004), shortest postoperative length of ICU stay (median 2.31, P<0.001), postoperative length of intubation (median 25.10, P<0.001), and post-operative length of hospital stay (median 21.00, P<0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed the highest 3-day survival (log-rank 7.387, P=0.03) and 5-day survival (log-rank 14.710, P=0.001) in the NIPPV group. After adjustment, NIPPV therapy was independently associated with the reduced 3-day [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.102, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.013-0.791, P=0.03] and 5-day (adjusted HR 0.057, 95% CI: 0.008-0.427, P=0.005) mortality in ED. Early utilization of NIPPV in AAD patients with hypoxemia in the ED can effectively decrease pre-operative intubation rate and perioperative mortality, and improve postoperative outcomes."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is a life-threatening clinical emergency, but it is often missed and misdiagnosed due to the limitations of diagnostic technology. In this study, we developed a deep learning-based algorithm for identifying the true and false lumens in the aorta on non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (NCE-CT) scans and to ascertain the presence of aortic dissection. Additionally, we compared the diagnostic performance of this algorithm with that of radiologists in detecting aortic dissection. We included 320 patients with suspected acute aortic syndrome from three centers (Beijing Anzhen Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University, Fujian Provincial Hospital, and Xiangya Hospital of Central South University) between May 2020 and May 2022 in this retrospective study. All patients underwent simultaneous NCE-CT and contrast-enhanced CT (CE-CT). The cohort comprised 160 patients with aortic dissection and 160 without aortic dissection. A deep learning algorithm, three-dimensional (3D) full-resolution U-Net, was continuously trained and refined to segment the true and false lumens of the aorta to determine the presence of aortic dissection. The algorithm's efficacy in detecting dissections was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, including the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the diagnostic capabilities between our algorithm and three radiologists was conducted. In diagnosing aortic dissection using NCE-CT images, the developed algorithm demonstrated an accuracy of 93.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): 89.8-98.3%], a sensitivity of 91.6% (95% CI: 86.7-95.8%), and a specificity of 95.6% (95% CI: 91.2-99.3%). In contrast, the radiologists achieved an accuracy of 88.8% (95% CI: 83.5-94.1%), a sensitivity of 90.6% (95% CI: 83.5-94.1%), and a specificity of 94.1% (95% CI: 72.9-97.6%). There was no significant difference between the algorithm's performance and radiologists' mean performance in accuracy, sensitivity, or specificity (P>0.05). The algorithm proficiently segments the true and false lumens in aortic NCE-CT images, exhibiting diagnostic capabilities comparable to those of radiologists in detecting aortic dissection. This suggests that the algorithm could reduce misdiagnoses in clinical practice, thereby enhancing patient care."

The aim of this study was to identify aortic aneurysm growth rate on serial echocardiography as well as the clinical and demographic variables that contribute to baseline aortic size and subsequent aortic growth. Patients identified with ascending aortic aneurysms and undergoing serial echocardiograms within 5 years were evaluated. Ascending aortic size was measured as part of routine echocardiographic examinations. Clinical and demographic variables including aortic valve type (trileaflet, bicuspid, or prosthetic) were evaluated for association with baseline aortic size as well as with aortic progression rate. Clinical events including aortic dissection and elective or emergent surgical repair were recorded. A total of 3,639 patients were identified (78% men; median age, 69 years), 175 (4.8%) with bicuspid valves and 206 (5.6%) with prior aortic valve replacement. Patients with larger aortas at baseline were older, with higher tobacco use and prior prosthetic valves. Over a mean of 2.4 years, aortic growth was observed and differed by valve type (trileaflet valve, 0.08 mm/y; bicuspid valve, 0.4 mm/y; P < .001). In six patients who developed aortic dissection, the estimated average annual growth rate was 0.98 mm/y. In a large echocardiographic cohort, aortic aneurysm growth rate was 0.08 mm/y, though it was higher in patients with bicuspid valves (0.4 mm/y), but initial aortic size did not correlate with change in the aortic progression rate. These data may help inform recommended echocardiographic surveillance intervals."

Data included patient demographics, history of disease, type of dissection according to the Sun's modified classification, time of onset, biochemical tests, and preoperative rupture. A total of 387 patients with TAAAD who met the inclusion criteria of Sun's modified classification were included. There were more complex types, with 75, 151 and 140 patients in the type A1C, A2C and A3C groups, respectively. The age of the entire group of patients was 51.46 ± 12.65 years and 283 (73.1%) were male. The time from onset to the emergency room was 25.37 ± 30.78 h. There were a few cases of TAAAD combined with stroke, pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, and lower extremity and organ ischemia in the complex type group. The white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil count (NEC) and blood amylase differed significantly between the groups. Three independent risk factors for preoperative rupture were identified: neutrophil count, blood potassium ion level, and platelet count. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that the Sun's modified classification could not be used to assess the risk of preoperative rupture in TAAAD. TAAAD was classified as the complex type in most patients. WBC, NEC and blood amylase were significantly different between the groups. NEC and serum potassium ion level were independent risk factors for preoperative rupture of TAAAD, while platelet count was its protective factor. More samples are needed to determine whether Sun's modified classification can be used to evaluate the risk of preoperative rupture."

Methylprednisolone, an anti-inflammatory agent, might suppress the systemic inflammatory response and lead to improved outcomes. However, the protective effects of methylprednisolone on TAAR for ATAAD were not clarified. The usage and dosage varied in different centers across the world. The Medal trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial to evaluate whether 500 mg methylprednisolone IV before cardiopulmonary bypass could reduce the incidence of postoperative major organ injury, compared to placebo. Adult patients with the diagnosis with ATAAD, awaiting emergency total aortic arch replacement with hypothermic circulatory arrest and selective cerebral perfusion will be included in the trial. A total of 340 eligible subjects from 9 large cardiovascular centers will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 500 mg methylprednislone or placebo before cardiopulmonary bypass. The primary outcome is postoperative major adverse outcome [defined as all-cause death or postoperative neurological deficit or KDIGO II -III acute kidney injury or respiratory syndrome (tracheal intubation> 72 hours, tracheostomy or re-intubation) until postoperative day 30 or patient discharge]. The study has received approval from the local Ethics Committees of the 9 participating centers, and enrolled its first subject in June 24, 2022. As of September 5, 2024, 323 subjects have been enrolled. Results of the Medal trial will be published once data collection and analysis have been completed.

The study investigates acute kidney injury (AKI) as a complication following acute aortic dissection and the effect of cluster nursing measures. Single-factor and multi-factor model analysis screened risk factors for postoperative renal injury complications after acute aortic dissection. Cluster nursing measures were implemented during the perioperative period. Changes in renal function and AKI incidence before and after surgery between the 2 groups were compared. Logistic regression model analysis identified increased preoperative SCr levels, prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time, and protracted aortic occlusion time as independent risk factors for AKI following acute aortic dissection surgery (P < .05). A high postoperative oxygenation index appeared to be a protective factor (P < .05). On day 1 and 3 after surgery, serum SCr and Cys-C levels in cluster nursing group were lower than those in routine nursing group. The incidence of postoperative AKI in the cluster nursing group was 2.86%, significantly lower than that in routine care group (17.14%, P < .05). Perioperative cluster nursing measures for acute aortic dissection patients can reduce renal injury caused by surgery and reduce the incidence of AKI."

    "abstract": "This study highlights the prevalence and conservative management strategies of iatrogenic ascending aortic dissection after percutaneous intervention (PCI) of chronic total occlusion (CTO). Retrospective analysis on patients who underwent CTO PCI from one medical center from 2020 to 2022 was performed by two operators. Data was obtained from the Prospective Global Registry for the Study of CTO database. Out of 318 patients, there were six reported cases of iatrogenic ascending aortic dissection. The causes of dissection included guiding catheter trauma, antegrade injection, two retrograde injection, and two cases of balloon rupture after lithotripsy. IVUS-guided stenting of the coronary back to the origin to seal the entry of the dissection flap occurred in two patients. All patients had a conservative management approach. No patient had to undergo urgent surgery. While the incidence remains rare, complications, including aortic dissection, are more frequent in CTO PCI as compared to non-CTO PCI. IVUS can be used to complete coronary intervention so long as the patient remains clinically and hemodynamically stable. Patients should have formal imaging with either transesophageal echocardiogram or computed tomography angiography. The outcomes of patients who experience iatrogenic aortic dissection during CTO PCI with stable coronary disease seem to be better than in patients with acute coronary syndrome."

    "abstract": "Hemoptysis has a broad differential diagnosis, with common causes including bronchiectasis, bronchitis, pulmonary tuberculosis, and lung neoplasms. While often benign, it can sometimes indicate more severe, life-threatening conditions. Herein we report the case of an 86-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department with a 30-day history of hemoptysis ultimately leading to hemodynamic instability. She was initially admitted to the emergency department for resuscitation and diagnostic workup. During the hospitalization, we identified a large, ruptured aneurysm of the descending and diaphragmatic aorta contained by a hematoma communicating the tracheobronchial tree. This case highlights the importance of considering a broad differential diagnosis in patients presenting with hemoptysis as it can signal severe underlying conditions such as a ruptured aortic aneurysm. Early recognition and appropriate management of these cases are crucial to improving patient outcomes."

We report the case of a symptomatic type II post-dissection thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm that was treated using a hybrid technique. The repair was carried out in 2 stages. In the first stage, we deployed 2 imbricated stent grafts in the descending thoracic aorta. A left carotid-to-left subclavian artery bypass was pre-emptively performed to obtain a proper proximal landing zone and as part of the manoeuvres to protect the spinal cord. The endovascular first stage was effective in obtaining proximal sealing but, as expected, it did not prevent distal reperfusion of the aneurysmatic false lumen. A few hours later, we moved on to the second stage in which we repaired the aneurysmal distal thoracic and abdominal aortic segment by means of a multibranched synthetic graft. The repair was carried out through a left thoracophreno-laparotomy in the seventh intercostal space. A left passive arterial bypass and selective cold renal and warm visceral perfusion were adopted to provide organ protection. Technical success was achieved and confirmed radiologically. The patient experienced mild postoperative paraplegia, which almost completely regressed after a neuromotor rehabilitation program."

The objective of this study was to determine differences in surgical outcomes between patients with Intramural Hematoma versus Type A Aortic Dissection undergoing Ascending Aortic Arch repair. This retrospective review of prospectively collected data included all patients with acute Intramural Hematoma or Type A Aortic Dissection who underwent emergent Ascending- or Arch Repair from January 2018 to May 2023 at a single academic institution. Primary outcomes included intraoperative mortality, 30-Day mortality, and postoperative stay. Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications. Outcomes were analyzed using Chi-squared, Fisher's Exact, and t-tests, with significance set at p < 0.05. A total of 107 patients were included, 27 of whom (25%) had Intramural Hematoma and 80 (75%) had Type A Aortic Dissection. There were no differences in preoperative characteristics such as age, gender, and comorbidities, and no differences in perioperative characteristics such as case length, cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic cross-clamp, and circulatory arrest times. When comparing postoperative outcomes, there was a higher rate of postoperative pericardial effusions requiring pericardial window in the Intramural Hematoma cohort compared to the Aortic Dissection cohort (15% [n = 4] vs. 3% [n = 2]; p = 0.02). There were no differences in other primary outcomes such as intraoperative mortality, 30-Day mortality, and postoperative length of stay. There were also no differences in the rates of postoperative complications such as bleeding requiring reoperation, cerebrovascular accident, atrial fibrillation, pleural effusion requiring thoracentesis, and surgery-related Emergency Department visits. Our analysis demonstrates similar outcomes for patients undergoing Ascending Aortic Arch repair between patients with Intramural Hematoma and Type A Aortic Dissection. Despite the higher rate of required postoperative pericardial windows in the Intramural Hematoma cohort, the overall primary outcomes remained comparable. These findings better elucidate the standard of care for patients with acute Intramural Hematoma undergoing Ascending Aortic Arch repair."

The clinical course is unpredictable; thus clinical vigilance should be maintained. It is very challenging to separate PAU from co-existing AAS as predisposing factors and findings overlap. Case of 58-year-old gentleman, who presented for atypical chest pain in the setting of respiratory tract infection. Computed Tomographic angiography (CTA) of the chest showed a large PAU and intramural hematoma which rapidly progressed into an acute aortic dissection in the emergency department. Close follow up with cardiac point of care ultrasound one hour later detected an intimal flap which was not initially present on CTA. Patient underwent surgical aortic graft replacement and had an uneventful in-hospital stay. This case underlines the importance of broadening differential diagnoses in atypical presentations in patients with risk factors. Prompt intervention and careful management are imperative to optimize patient outcomes and prevent complications of aortic lesions. Cardiac point of care ultrasound can help in detecting progression of dynamic atherosclerotic diseases such as acute aortic syndrome."

    "abstract": "Acute chest pain (ACP) is one of the most common symptoms in patients admitted to emergency departments (ED). It can be related to several life-threatening cardiovascular conditions such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS), aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism. The optimal triage of patients with ACP is a clinical and healthcare necessity given the large number of patients daily admitted to ED with this symptom. The first contact with the patient in ED includes the clinical appraisal of the characteristics of ACP and coexisting symptoms, and the assessment of the patient's medical history. Risk scores may help stratify a patient's likelihood of having cardiac chest pain. The ECG examination allows the identification of patients with ST-segment elevation, depression, or T-wave changes, but may be normal in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS. Rapid protocols based on serial high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays within one or two hours are recommended for identifying candidates for early discharge. Due to the bedside feasibility, non-invasiveness, and wide availability, transthoracic echocardiography represents the first-line imaging modality for evaluating patients with ACP. In selected cases, computed tomography angiography may also be performed. A practical approach to ACP in ED should improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare system costs. This review aimed to provide an overview of the characteristics of patients with ACP of cardiac origin and to describe the state of the art about their management in the ED."

This research seeks to assess long-term outcomes and quality of life after emergency surgery for acute aortic dissection type A. Methods: A total of 413 patients were analysed, who had been operated upon between 2000 and 2016 at our centre. We compared our results of the early (2000-2007) versus late (2008-2016) period with regards to 30-day and follow-up mortality and need for reoperation, including risk factor analysis. Quality of life was assessed via the SF-36 survey. Results: Calculated perioperative risk by EuroSCORE increased significantly from early, 24.9%, to late, 38.0%, p < 0.001. Thirty-day rates of mortality decreased significantly from 26.7% to 17.4%, p = 0.03. Survival at 1-, 5-, and 10-years was 92.3% vs. 91.8% (p = 0.91), 75.2% vs. 81.0% (p = 0.29), and 53.4% vs. 69.7% (p = 0.04). Freedom from reoperation was comparable between groups at follow-up: 74.0% vs. 85.7%, p = 0.28. Quality of life was impaired. Conclusions: Despite more complex severity of disease and operative procedures, the results of surgery for type A aortic dissection improved significantly over time at 30-day and 10-year follow-up.

    "abstract": "Background: We have employed a conservative management approach, including intensive control of both blood pressure and heart rate, in patients with aortic intramural hematoma (AIMH) and retrograde thrombosed type A acute aortic dissection (RT-TAAAD), sharing common clinical and imaging characteristics. Methods: To evaluate the outcomes of our conservative management approach, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 98 patients diagnosed with AIMH or RT-TAAAD from January 2008 to March 2023. A conservative management approach was applied, except for those patients with an aortic diameter ≥ 55 mm, false lumen expansion, or cardiac tamponade, who underwent emergency aortic repair. Results: Besides 2 patients, who declined surgery and subsequently died from aortic rupture, 18 patients underwent urgent aortic surgery, while 78 did not. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified the extrusion type of ulcer-like projections (ULPs) on admission and a maximum aortic diameter ≥ 45 mm on Day 1 as risk factors for acute aortic surgery. Among the 78 patients who were discharged, 9 (12%) underwent aortic surgery, while 69 (88%) did not, with a median follow-up of 44 months. The overall actuarial aortic surgery-free rates were 78% at 1 year and 72% at 5 years, respectively. A Cox proportional hazards analysis identified ULPs and an aortic diameter ≥ 45 mm at discharge as risk factors for late aortic surgery. Conclusions: The early and late outcomes of our conservative strategy for AIMH and RT-TAAAD demonstrate favorable surgery-free rates. The extrusion type of ULPs on admission and an aortic diameter ≥ 45 mm on Day 1 are predictors of acute aortic surgery, while ULPs and an aortic diameter ≥ 45 mm at discharge are predictors of late surgery."

This study investigated the management and outcomes of TEVAR and EVAR as alternatives to traditional open surgical repair for managing aortic pathologies. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. We analyzed the data from 59 consecutive patients who underwent TEVAR or EVAR between 2015 and 2022 at a single tertiary care center. The primary outcome was survival, and secondary outcomes were complications assessment, including re-intervention and occurrence of endoleaks. Results: TEVAR accounted for 47.5% of cases (n = 28), while EVAR comprised 52.5% (n = 31). Patients were mostly 61-70 years old (23.7%) and male (91.5%). Surgery indications differed, with aneurysmal repair being the prevalent indication for EVAR (90.3%, n = 28) and trauma being the main indication for TEVAR (67.9%, n = 19). Regarding the primary outcome, 11 patients (18.6%) died for various reasons; of those, 2 patients (3.4%) were determined to have died from vascular-related issues. Most patients (81.4%, n = 48) did not experience intraoperative complications. The most common intraoperative complications were endoleaks and access failure, each affecting 5.1% (n = 3) of patients. Re-intervention was necessary in 16.9% (n = 10) of cases, with endoleaks being the major indication (60%). Emergency intervention was more frequent in the TEVAR group (p = 0.013), resulting in significantly longer hospitalization (p = 0.012). Conclusions: Despite limitations, our analysis indicates a good safety profile with high success rates and a low incidence of adverse health outcomes and mortality in TEVAR/EVAR procedures. Nevertheless, the results emphasize the ongoing concern of endograft leaks, necessitating re-interventions."

    "abstract": "Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has increasingly become the preferred surgical intervention for Stanford type B aortic dissection (TBAD). The primary objective of this procedure is to seal the primary entry tear to promote positive aortic remodeling. However, the increased use of TEVAR has also led to a rise in surgical complications. Among these, the accidental deployment of the stent into the false lumen is a rare but serious complication that can result in aortic false lumen rupture and inadequate perfusion of abdominal organs. This case report described a 78-year-old man who presented to our hospital with sudden onset chest and back pain and was subsequently diagnosed with TBAD via aortic CTA. As conventional medical therapy failed to alleviate his chest pain, the patient underwent TEVAR. During the procedure, a complication arose when the distal end of the endograft was mistakenly deployed into the false lumen, leading to insufficient perfusion of the abdominal organs. Recognizing this issue intraoperatively, an additional endograft was promptly inserted at the distal end to reroute blood flow back to the true lumen of the aorta, thereby restoring visceral perfusion. Post-intervention, the patient's chest pain improved, and he was successfully discharged from the hospital. Accidental deployment of a endograft into the false lumen during TEVAR is a rare but serious complication. Intraoperative angiography plays a crucial role in rapidly and accurately identifying this issue by detecting insufficient perfusion of abdominal organs. The use of intravascular ultrasound may help reduce the incidence of this complication. Endovascular repair is an effective emergency strategy to quickly redirect blood flow back to the true lumen, making it the preferred method for managing such emergencies."

A 36-year-old male with fever and cough was found to have clinical features suggestive of Marfan syndrome. Examination revealed bilateral fine crackles and a diastolic heart murmur. Imaging showed bilateral infiltrates, hyperinflation, and aortic dissection. Echocardiography confirmed severe aortic valve regurgitation and Stanford type A dissection. Despite recommended surgery, the patient opted for medical therapy due to financial constraints, showing stable cardiac anomalies after 6 months. Aortic dissection, a critical cardiovascular emergency, affects mainly the elderly, exacerbated by hypertension, atherosclerosis, and connective tissue disorders. Early detection via CT and biomarkers is crucial. Type A dissections typically require surgical repair, while endovascular repair is used for complex Type B cases, reducing long-term mortality. The TEM system aids in categorization, guiding treatment. Conditions like Marfan syndrome significantly contribute to aortic wall degeneration, requiring close monitoring and intervention. The coalescence of aortic dissections with Marfan syndrome underscores the need for tailored monitoring in high-risk populations and highlights the silent complexities of cardiovascular pathologies, urging refined diagnostics and therapeutic approaches."

Prompt diagnosis and intervention are crucial to minimize complications; high suspicion for AAD should be exercised in patients presenting with acute sheering chest pain. While obtaining a proper history and performing a physical examination are important in the diagnostic process, not all cases present with typical symptoms. This can make diagnosis challenging, especially in patients who present with cognitive disorientation, making it difficult to take a proper history. We present the case of a 57-year-old male who presented to the emergency department (ED) of a community hospital with cognitive disorientation and abdominal pain that began two days prior to presentation and was associated with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Laboratory results showed that the patient had an elevated white blood cell count, hyperkalemia, acute renal injury, and elevated lactate levels. Initial chest radiography and computed tomography showed no acute findings. Urine toxicology was positive for cocaine. The elevated lactate levels and cocaine use prompted us to order a computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the abdomen and pelvis with suspicion for bowel ischemia. He was found to have an abdominal aortic dissection with extrinsic compression of the patent true lumen. He was then transferred to a tertiary care facility, and a repeat CTA of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed a type A aortic dissection with extensive bowel ischemia. The patient was deemed too unstable for surgical repair and expired. The case highlights the challenges of diagnosing AAD due to its varied presentations and emphasizes the importance of maintaining a high suspicion for the condition in high-risk individuals.

This study aimed to identify predictors of long-term aortic events from early postoperative computed tomography (CT) examinations. A total of 336 cases underwent TAAAD surgery at two institutions between 2002 and 2018. Of these, 302 patients received CT examinations immediately after initial TAAAD surgery. Predictors of aortic events were evaluated from these early postoperative CT exams. Aortic events were defined as any events involving aortic-related death, open surgery, reoperation, endovascular stenting, or thoracic aorta diameter enlargement to ≥ 55 mm. Excluding 34 in-hospital deaths (10.1%; 34/336), the 1-, 5-, and 10-year actuarial survival rates after primary TAAAD surgery were 98.2%, 88.6%, and 81.7%, respectively. Over a mean follow-up period of 7.4 ± 5.1 years, 67 aortic events (proximal: 19, distal: 45, both: 3) were observed. Freedom from proximal aortic events was 98.6%, 93.9%, and 85.2% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Proximal anastomosis new entry was identified as a significant risk factor for aortic events, with a 92% vs. 42% incidence at 10 years (p < 0.001). Freedom from distal aortic events was 99.6%, 84.5%, and 67.2% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively.

We report a case of a patient with a chief complaint of ascites for whom close examination revealed that the liver injury was attributed to constrictive pericarditis and chronic aortic dissection, with immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related disease (IgG4-RD) as the primary cause. A 72-year-old man presented to the emergency department with scrotal oedema and ascites. Initially, the patient was hospitalized in the Department of Hepatology. However, computed tomography (CT) revealed aortic dissection (DeBakey type II), pericardial thickening, and impaired right ventricular dilatation. Therefore, we performed an ascending aortic replacement. IgG4 staining of the aortic wall revealed an IgG4/IgG-positive cell ratio of 35%. Pathological examination did not confirm the diagnosis of IgG4-related aortitis; however, the patient was diagnosed with IgG4-RD because of decreased blood IgG4 levels in response to steroid medication and the presence of heterogeneous thickened lesions in the pericardium. The patient took prednisolone 5 mg/day for 1 month post-operatively. His IgG4 level decreased but re-elevated above the baseline value after discontinuation of oral medication. Liver cirrhosis was suspected given the ascites, although a CT scan on admission confirmed insufficiency of systemic circulation due to cardiac constrictive pericarditis with aortic dissection. Despite the complexity of various pathologies in this patient, collaborative efforts and effective communication within the medical team enabled successful aortic surgery, averting life-threatening complications."

    "abstract": "This multicenter retrospective study evaluated the diagnostic performance of a deep learning (DL)-based application for detecting, classifying, and highlighting suspected aortic dissections (ADs) on chest and thoraco-abdominal CT angiography (CTA) scans. CTA scans from over 200 U.S. and European cities acquired on 52 scanner models from six manufacturers were retrospectively collected and processed by CINA-CHEST (AD) (Avicenna.AI, La Ciotat, France) device. The diagnostic performance of the device was compared with the ground truth established by the majority agreement of three U.S. board-certified radiologists. Furthermore, the DL algorithm's time to notification was evaluated to demonstrate clinical effectiveness. The study included 1303 CTAs (mean age 58.8 ± 16.4 years old, 46.7% male, 10.5% positive). The device demonstrated a sensitivity of 94.2% [95% CI: 88.8-97.5%] and a specificity of 97.3% [95% CI: 96.2-98.1%]. The application classified positive cases by the AD type with an accuracy of 99.5% [95% CI: 98.9-99.8%] for type A and 97.5 [95% CI: 96.4-98.3%] for type B. The application did not miss any type A cases. The device flagged 32 cases incorrectly, primarily due to acquisition artefacts and aortic pathologies mimicking AD. The mean time to process and notify of potential AD cases was 27.9 ± 8.7 s. This deep learning-based application demonstrated a strong performance in detecting and classifying aortic dissection cases, potentially enabling faster triage of these urgent cases in clinical settings."

To describe the surgical protocol and the short and long-term results of aortic arch replacement surgery in a center in the metropolitan region of Santiago, Chile. Retrospective descriptive study from April 2015 to August 2022. Elective, urgent, and emergency patients were included, with diagnoses of arch aneurysm and acute or chronic type I and II DeBakey aortic dissection. Arterial cannulation at the brachiocephalic trunk, right axillary artery, or directly into the true lumen of the aortic dissection with Seldinger technique, guided by epiaortic and transesophagic ultrasound. Deep hypothermia at 24°C. Uni or bilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion according to runoff. Four devices were used: a straight tube, a tube with 3 or 4 branches, and a frozen elephant trunk. 37 patients were operated on; 24 of them were men. The average age was 57 years old. In seven patients, a straight tube with anastomosis was used with anastomosis on the island; in six patients, a tube with 3 branches; in ten patients, a tube with four branches; and in fourteen patients, a frozen elephant trunk. There were twenty-one patients (57%) with associated morbidity: prolonged mechanical ventilation 14 the most frequent, paralysis chordae in 7 patients; there were six neurological morbidities, one of them permanent, renal dysfunction in 5 patients, pneumonia associated with mechanical ventilation in 4 patients, reoperation due to bleeding in 4. There was no associated cardiac morbidity. Operative and global mortality at 30 days was 13.5%. Follow-up was closed in October 2022 and is complete in the 30 survivors; the average was 20 months. Two patients died in the follow-up at five years; the survival in the follow-up was 90%. The management protocol has good results regarding morbidity and mortality, similar to the international series."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) is a life-threatening cardiovascular emergency that is often misdiagnosed as other chest pain conditions. Physiologically, AD may cause abnormalities in peripheral blood flow, which can be detected using pulse oximetry waveforms. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of identifying AD based on pulse oximetry waveforms and to highlight the key waveform features that play a crucial role in this diagnostic method. This prospective study employed high-risk chest pain cohorts from two emergency departments. The initial cohort was enriched with AD patients (n = 258, 47% AD) for model development, while the second cohort consisted of chest pain patients awaiting angiography (n = 71, 25% AD) and was used for external validation. Pulse oximetry waveforms from the four extremities were collected for each patient. After data preprocessing, a recognition model based on the random forest algorithm was trained using patients' gender, age, and waveform difference features extracted from the pulse oximetry waveforms. The performance of the model was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and decision curve analysis (DCA). The importance of features was also assessed using Shapley Value and Gini importance. The model demonstrated strong performance in identifying AD in both the training and external validation sets. In the training set, the model achieved an area under the ROC curve of 0.979 (95% CI: 0.961-0.990), sensitivity of 0.918 (95% CI: 0.873-0.955), specificity of 0.949 (95% CI: 0.912-0.985), and accuracy of 0.933 (95% CI: 0.904-0.959). In the external validation set, the model attained an area under the ROC curve of 0.855 (95% CI: 0.720-0.965), sensitivity of 0.889 (95% CI: 0.722-1.000), specificity of 0.698 (95% CI: 0.566-0.812), and accuracy of 0.794 (95% CI: 0.672-0.878). Decision curve analysis (DCA) further showed that the model provided a substantial net benefit for identifying AD. The median mean and median variance of the four limbs' signals were the most influential features in the recognition model. This study demonstrated the feasibility and strong performance of identifying AD based on peripheral pulse oximetry waveforms in high-risk chest pain populations in the emergency setting. The findings also provided valuable insights for future human fluid dynamics simulations to elucidate the impact of AD on blood flow in greater detail."

    "abstract": "A hypertensive crisis is defined as a sudden and significant rise in blood pressure. The blood pressure reading is 180/120 mmHg or higher. A hypertensive crisis is a medical emergency. It can lead to a heart attack, stroke, or other life-threatening medical problems. Investigating the management of the hypertensive crisis was the goal of this study. English-language articles were collected from 2010 to 2024 demonstrating the management of the hypertensive crisis. Overall, there were 15 articles. Surveys and analyses of national databases were the most widely used methods (n=15). The scientific studies documented (1) all investigative studies or reports that included a hypertensive crisis diagnosis, (2) data integrity and reproducibility, and (3) management studies. Other studies show that acute severe hypertension in the hospital is associated with high rates of mortality and morbidity, particularly with new or worsening end-organ damage. The problem is linked to poor medical adherence, but alarmingly low follow-up rates are likely to contribute to a high recurrence rate. The treatment of acute severe hypertension varies according to the hospital unit (medical ward or intensive care unit), medication, and blood pressure targets or thresholds. Because of a lack of evidence-based guidance, arbitrary blood pressure control targets are used, or blood pressure targets are crudely extrapolated from guidelines intended primarily for outpatient management. Patients with acute aortic dissection need to be administered intravenous esmolol within 5 to 10 minutes in order to lower their blood pressure right away. The goal is to maintain a systolic reading of less than 120 mm Hg. Vasodilators such as nitroglycerin or nitroprusside may be administered if the blood pressure persists following beta blocking. Intravenous administration of clevidipine, nicardipine, or phentolamine is required; the initial dose is 5 mg, with subsequent doses given every 10 minutes as necessary to achieve the desired reduction in blood pressure."

A 41-year-old man was admitted to hospital after severe chest pain. Computed tomography angiography(CTA)revealed a type A aortic dissection. Echocardiography showed moderate aortic valve regurgitation and an aortic sinus diameter of 38 mm( mm). The patient underwent emergency Bentall surgery (using a preset coronary artery orifice patch), total arch replacement, and implantation of a graft into the descending aorta. Follow-up echocardiography showed the patient cardiac function was good, and there was no residual leakage at the coronary artery orifice. This method is an alternative to traditional Bentall surgery and is suitable for all aortic root lesions, especially those with mild aortic sinus dilation or concomitant aortic dissection."

Here we investigated the safety and efficacy of rTM after aortic surgery in patients with acute aortic dissection (AAD). A total of 316 patients diagnosed with AAD underwent emergent ascending aortic replacement or total arch replacement between 2010 and 2019. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical information of 62 patients with the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine's acute-stage DIC diagnostic criteria (JAAM criteria) with a score of ≥ 4. We assigned 62 patients to two groups, either non-rTM group (n = 29) or rTM group (n = 33). Patient characteristics, surgical procedures, and postoperative outcome data including coagulation function and the JAAM DIC score in both groups were collected. The decrease in the number of platelets was clearly suppressed on days 1-3 in the rTM group. On days 1-4, fibrin degradation product levels were upregulated in the non-rTM group but significantly downregulated in the rTM group. Five operative deaths occurred within 30 days postoperative (two [6.9%] in the non-rTM group vs. three [9.1%] in the rTM group). The JAAM DIC score showed a gradually improving trend from postoperative day 1 in the rTM group. Postoperative rTM administration for AAD may be a safe and promising novel treatment strategy for improving the JAAM DIC score."

It is a multicentre, retrospective, physician-initiated cohort study of patients treated from 28 July 2021 to 3 April 2024. Inclusion criteria were isolate left subclavian artery revascularization for elective or urgent/emergent 'zone 2' TEVAR. The primary outcome was technical success and freedom from ISF TEVAR-related reintervention or endoleak. We treated 50 patients: 28 (56.0%) atherosclerotic thoracic aneurysms, 12 (24.0%) type B aortic dissection and 10 (20.0%) penetrating aortic ulcers. Elective intervention was carried out in 46 (92.0%) cases. ISF was successful in all cases, with a procedural primary technical success in 47 (94.0%) cases. The median time of intervention was 184 min (interquartile range 135-220) with a median fenestration time of 20 min (interquartile range 13-35). Operative mortality did not occur. We observed 1 case of spinal cord ischaemia and 2 cases of bilateral posterior non-disabling stroke. Mortality at 30 days occurred in 1 (2.0%) patient (not aorta-related). The median follow-up was 4 months (interquartile range 1-12.25). Bridging stent graft patency was 100% with no ISF-related endoleak. ISF-related reintervention was never required. ISF TEVAR using the Ankura™-II device with the self-centring adjustable needle system showed high technical success, promising stability and stable aortic-related outcomes. Owing to these results, it represents a safe and effective alternative for standard 'zone 2' TEVAR."

    "abstract": "Selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (sACP) is a crucial cerebral protection technique employed during aortic dissection surgeries involving cardiopulmonary bypass. However, postoperative neurological complications, particularly those related to cannulation issues and perfusion problems, remain a significant concern. This case report details an unusual instance where a 38-year-old male patient with Marfan syndrome experienced cerebral hypoperfusion during emergency surgery for Stanford Type A aortic dissection. Despite following standard protocols, a significant drop in regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) and abnormal blood pressure fluctuations were observed shortly after initiating sACP via the innominate artery. After initial attempts to optimize perfusion flow proved ineffective, the cannulation position was adjusted, leading to improvements. Nevertheless, the patient subsequently exhibited signs of cerebral hypoperfusion and was found to have suffered a new cerebral infarction. This case report underscores the importance of precise cannula placement during sACP procedures and the dire consequences that can arise from improper positioning. It emphasizes the need for continuous monitoring and prompt intervention in cases of abnormal cerebral oxygenation and blood pressure, as well as the value of considering cannulation-related issues as potential causes of postoperative neurological complications."

Limited by the aortic valve proximally, the intramural haematoma involved the aortic root, ascending aorta, aortic arch, including adjacent parts of supra-aortic branches, and descending aorta extending to the diaphragmatic level. The operative strategy involved urgent total aortic arch replacement with the frozen elephant trunk technique and anatomical reimplantation of the three supra-aortic vessels. The direct open over-the-wire technique was used to cannulate the right axillary artery, and standard venous cannulation was performed while brain protection was achieved with bilateral selective antegrade cerebral perfusion."

    "abstract": "The bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital cardiac abnormality. Though most often isolated, BAV may be associated with other cardiovascular malformations. BAV-related aortopathy is the most common, sharing genetic alterations and phenotypic heterogeneity characteristics. Sometimes silent for a lifetime, BAV may manifest as aortic valve dysfunction, aortic aneurysm, or more emergent situations, such as endocarditis or aortic dissection. Its embryological origin and the characterization of the genes involved, as well as the histopathological and hemodynamic aspects of its natural history, are becoming increasingly clear. In addition, emerging evidence of rhythm disorders associated with BAV has been identified. A new international nomenclature and classification has been introduced to interpret all the advances made in recent years for the comprehension of this condition. In the guidelines, more attention has been paid to the diagnosis of BAV and related aortopathy, together with surveillance, and family screening. Surgical treatment remains the gold standard, especially in young low-risk patients, and valve repair techniques have been shown to be effective and durable. Finally, the new era of transcatheter techniques is also being applied to dysfunctional BAV, allowing the treatment of patients at high surgical risk, with increasingly promising results, and the possibility of expanding indications through the introduction of more advanced devices. This review aims to comprehensively describe the BAV conundrum, focusing on anatomy, pathophysiology, genetics, diagnosis of BAV-related disorders, and the different treatment options available in the transcatheter era."

The systemic inflammatory response can influence the prognosis of AD, and in this context, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) emerges as a simple and rapid inflammatory biomarker. This retrospective cohort study included 103 patients diagnosed with AD and treated in the emergency department between 2018 and 2023. Patient demographics, clinical features, and laboratory results were evaluated. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to adjust for potential confounders such as age, mean systolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation, hemoglobin, lactate values, and the presence of coronary artery disease. The ability of NLR to predict mortality was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The study population was divided into two groups: non-survivors (68% mortality rate) and survivors (32% survival rate). The non-survivor group had significantly higher NLR values compared to the survivor group (median NLR 7.66 vs. 2.5, p<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified NLR as an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42-3.82, p<0.001). ROC analysis for NLR demonstrated high discriminative power with an area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of 0.851 (95% CI 0.768-0.914). The determined cut-off point was >5.08 with a sensitivity of 77.14% and specificity of 81.82%. The findings indicate that high NLR is strongly associated with increased mortality risk in patients with AD and can be used in emergency clinical settings to predict mortality."

A retrospective review was conducted on 38 patients with LDS who underwent aortic surgery at our institution between January 1995 and June 2022. The primary endpoint was freedom from aortic reoperation. Among the patients, the median age at the initial surgery was 33 (range: 39-44) years, and 23 (60.5%) patients were male. Twenty-one (55.3%; aortic dissection or rupture (n = 2) and aneurysm (n = 19)) patients were diagnosed with LDS before the initial surgery (ED group). Meanwhile, the remaining 17 (44.7%; aortic dissection or rupture (n = 13) and aneurysm (n = 4)) patients were after surgery [delayed diagnosis (DD) group]. The ED group had significantly lower rates of emergency surgery and concomitant arch procedure (P < .001, respectively) but a higher rate of valve-sparing root surgery (P = .018) compared to the DD group. No in-hospital mortality was observed in either group. Nevertheless, the ED group had a shorter postoperative hospital stay (median difference: 3 days, P = .032) and a lower rate of aortic reoperation (P = .013). Early detection of LDS may help in preventing acute aortic syndrome, reducing the risk of aortic reoperation, and potentially shortening hospital stay. Careful medical management before surgery could contribute to better clinical outcomes and an improved quality of life for patients with LDS."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is a critical and life-threatening condition that can present with atypical symptoms, often leading to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. The report presents a case of a 65-year-old male who initially exhibited fever, right-sided chest pain, and a productive cough, resulting in an initial diagnosis of pneumonia. Despite empirical antibiotic therapy, his symptoms persisted, prompting further investigation. A computed tomography (CT) scan ultimately revealed a Type B aortic dissection. The patient was then transferred to a specialized tertiary care facility for successful endovascular intervention. This case underscores the importance of considering aortic dissection in patients presenting with persistent, atypical symptoms that do not respond to standard treatments, such as unexplained fever and chest pain. It highlights the crucial role of advanced imaging techniques, such as CT scans, in achieving an accurate and timely diagnosis. Clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion and ensure prompt referral to specialized centers to improve patient outcomes in this potentially fatal condition."

Therefore, in this study, we analyzed patients' treatment courses from the initial management to hospital discharge in cases of acute aortic dissection (AAD) with malperfusion and investigated the risk factors associated with mortality. We evaluated cases of AAD with malperfusion treated at our institution over a 16-year period from 2007 to 2022. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. The study's primary outcome measure was mortality during hospitalization. We collected and analyzed data encompassing preoperative patient characteristics, Stanford classification, sites of preoperative malperfusion, surgical techniques employed, and postoperative complications. These variables were examined to identify factors associated with in-hospital mortality. During the study period, 366 patients were admitted with AAD, 102 of whom had malperfusion. There were 62 men (61%) and 40 women (39%), with a mean age of 64 ± 13 years (range: 28-87 years). According to the Stanford classification, 75 (74%) and 27 (26%) patients had type A and B aortic dissection, respectively, and 29 patients (28%) presented with shock. Preoperative malperfusion sites included the brain, coronary arteries, abdominal viscera, limbs, and spinal cord in 40 (39%), 10 (10%), 34 (33%), 52 (51%), and six (6%) patients, respectively. Eleven (11%) patients required immediate intervention in the emergency department. The treatments administered to the patients were as follows: ascending aortic replacement, 30 (29%) patients; aortic arch replacement, 34 (33%) patients; root replacement, three (3%) patients; thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), 12 (12%) patients; non-anatomic bypass, five (5%) patients; and conservative management, five (5%) patients. In-hospital mortality occurred in 23 (23%) patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified preoperative coronary malperfusion as an independent risk factor of mortality. Preoperative coronary malperfusion is an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality in patients with AAD presenting with malperfusion."

An 81-year-old man with a pre-existing infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm and highly tortuous aorta was referred to our ward for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) with New York Heart Association functional class II. On hospital Day 2, the patient complained of intermittent dull pain over chest and back; ADHF or acute coronary syndrome was suspected. On Day 3, we transferred the patient to the intensive care unit due to ADHF with cardiogenic shock attributed to fluid overload, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and severe mitral regurgitation with severely impaired left ventricular ejection fraction. Given the heightened surgical risk, TEE was performed to evaluate the eligibility of mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair. The first mid-oesophageal long-axis view showed no evidence of dissection. After 20 min, the same view showed the occurrence of TAAD. Urgent contrast CT confirmed a TAAD extending from the aortic root to the infrarenal abdominal aorta. Due to the prohibitive risk for surgical repair of TAAD, the patient received palliative care and unfortunately passed away on hospital Day 6. Albeit rare, TAAD could progress or de novo occur during TEE, especially in high-risk patients. Therefore, high alertness during TEE procedures is imperative. Moreover, in patients with AD and poor renal function, the risk of using TEE as an alternative diagnostic modality should be carefully considered."

    "abstract": "Objective: Acute aortic dissection is a rare but frequently fatal aortic catastrophe with high morbidity and mortality. Especially in pregnant patients, acute dissection is often misdiagnosed putting two lives on the line. Due to its scarcity, only case reports have been reported. The aim of this study is to analyze the time of aortic dissection during the course of pregnancy and the outcome of emergency surgery in pregnant women with and without hereditary connective tissue disorder. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all acute aortic dissections (type A and B) who underwent emergency aortic surgery at our institution between 1994 and 2022 and identified 13 patients with acute aortic dissection during pregnancy or directly postpartum. Mann-Whitney U and Fisher's exact tests were used for statistical analysis. Results: Of the 13 included patients, 5 had a genetic syndrome. These patients were significantly younger at the time of dissection and at an earlier stage of pregnancy (second trimester). Even though operative and in-house mortality was zero, we lost one patient on postoperative day 14 due to rupture of the aortic root after transfer to another hospital. Survival of neonates was 77% including two aborted pregnancies. Conclusions: Surgical treatment of acute aortic dissection during pregnancy can be performed with excellent operative mortality for the mothers and satisfying survival of their neonates. In patients with genetic syndrome, dissection occurs during the early second trimester, whereas non-syndromic patients experience acute dissection in the late third trimester. Long-term follow-up is essential for timely re-intervention, if needed."

Our facility, the Nasu Red Cross Hospital, located in the northern part of Tochigi Prefecture, is a core hospital for advanced emergency medical care, with eight cardiologists who can provide emergency coronary angioplasty for patients with acute coronary syndrome. However, we have no cardiovascular surgery section, so it is challenging to treat patients who require urgent surgical intervention. Therefore, we promptly transfer patients with type A aortic dissection to 8 facilities inside and outside the prefecture that have cardiovascular surgery sections. In regional hospitals like ours, without cardiovascular surgeons, it is necessary to provide a qualified diagnosis, initiate treatment for patients with acute aortic dissection including immediate blood pressure lowering and pain control using narcotics, and transfer patients eligible for urgent surgical intervention promptly to facilities with cardiovascular surgery sections. For smooth patient transfer, it is essential to build a close medical cooperation system that has daily interactions."

Regarding indirect TTE signs, pooled sensitivities and specificities were 64% (5.2-98.2%) and 94% (92-96.1%), respectively for aortic valve regurgitation, 92% (54-99.2%) and 87% (62-97%) for thoracic aortic aneurysm and 39% (33.8-45%) and 94% (92-95%) for pericardial effusion. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, bedside-focused TTE has high specificity for type A and B dissection, a moderate to high sensitivity for type A but poor for type B, and unclear diagnostic accuracy for intramural haematoma and penetrating aortic ulcer."

We report a case of a 29-year-old pregnant woman presenting with an acute type B aortic dissection. Owing to cardiopulmonary decompensation and intestinal malperfusion, she underwent an emergency cesarean section followed by left subclavian to carotid transposition and thoracic endovascular aortic repair that was complicated by a retrograde type A aortic dissection and was managed surgically. Molecular testing confirmed the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. This case highlights that multidisciplinary and hybrid management of challenging cases of acute aortic syndromes can result in a favorable outcome."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is an extremely life-threatening medical emergency, often misdiagnosed in its early stages, resulting in prolonged wait times for rescue. This study aims to identify potential serum biomarkers that can assist in the accurate diagnosis of AAD and effectively differentiate it from other conditions causing severe chest pain. A total of 122 patients with AAD and 129 patients with other severe chest pain disorders were included in the study. Serum samples were analyzed by measuring the peak intensities of Raman spectra. For each measurement, the Raman spectrum was accumulated by two accumulations (3 s per acquisition). Logistic regression and nomogram models were developed using these peak intensities as well as D-dimer levels to predict the occurrence of AAD. The clinical utilities of these models were assessed through receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis, net reclassification improvement (NRI), integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), and decision curve analysis (DCA) in both training and internal test cohorts. The D-dimer levels of AAD patients were significantly increased, as well as higher intensities at specific Raman peaks, including 505 cm-1, 842 cm-1, 947 cm-1, 1254 cm-1, 1448 cm-1, and 1655 cm-1 when compared to non-AAD patients. Conversely, decreased intensities were observed at Raman peaks such as 750 cm-1, 1004 cm-1, 1153 cm-1, 1208 cm-1, and 1514 cm-1 in AAD patients. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis on the training cohort identified eight potential predictors: D-dimer along with intensity measurements at peaks such as 505 cm-1, 750 cm-1, 1153 cm-1, 1208 cm-1, 1254 cm-1, 1448 cm-1, and 1655 cm-1. The combination of these eight potential predictors demonstrated a good discriminatory performance, with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.928 in the training cohort and an AUC of 0.936 in the internal test cohort, outperforming the use of D-dimer alone. Furthermore, DCA curve analysis revealed that leveraging this combination of eight potential predictors would provide substantial net benefits for clinical application. Moreover, this combination significantly augmented discrimination power, as evidenced by a continuous NRI of 39.8 % and IDI of 9.95 % in the training cohort, as well as a continuous NRI of 27.1 % and IDI of 9.95 % in the internal test cohort. The employment of this combination of eight potential predictors effectively rules out AAD to a greater extent. This study presents a promising diagnostic strategy for early detection using optical diagnostic techniques such as Raman spectroscopy."

    "abstract": "Tissue necrosis from persistent mesenteric ischemia after aortic dissection may progress to sepsis and death without emergency laparotomy. However, the signs of mesenteric necrosis are common in patients experiencing nonsurvivable multisystem failure after aortic catastrophe. This study examined when and whether laparotomy offers a chance for meaningful survival in these patients. A total of 145 patients treated for acute type A or type B aortic dissection with mesenteric ischemia were identified from a single institution from 2006 to 2022. Of those patients, 29 underwent laparotomy, all for compelling clinical indications. Detailed clinical characteristics were studied with respect to short- and long-term outcomes in these patients. Among the patients who underwent laparotomy, 45% (13 of 29) survived to discharge compared with 71% (103 of 145) of all patients with mesenteric malperfusion. Serum lactate and arterial pH were both very strongly associated with survival after laparotomy. Among survivors and nonsurvivors, the mean lactate level before laparotomy was 6.3 mmol/L vs 13.4 mmol/L (P = .024), and the mean pH was 7.39 vs 7.20 (P < .001). In particular, a lactate value higher than 8 mmol/L (odd ratio, 16.5; 95% CI, 2.0-192; P = .003) and a pH lower than 7.30 (odds ratio, 14.4; 95% CI, 1.87-128; P = .003) were highly predictive of mortality. Survival to discharge after laparotomy for patients with both severe lactatemia and severe acidosis (defined earlier) was 9% (1 of 11) compared with 90% (9 of 10) for patients with neither severe lactatemia nor acidosis. The degree of lactic acidosis can effectively identify patients for whom laparotomy is futile and those for whom it is not after aortic dissection with mesenteric ischemia."

    "abstract": "The frozen elephant trunk (FET) technique, initially developed as a one-stage procedure to treat extensive thoracic aortic aneurysms, has since been adapted to address acute and chronic aortic dissections by closing entry tears and expanding the true lumen. It has become widely adopted due to its effectiveness in managing aortic diseases. We present the case of a 39-year-old female with microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) who developed recurrent type B aortic dissection accompanied by rapid expansion. The patient, a compromised host with multiple comorbidities such as glomerulonephritis, chronic renal failure, alveolar hemorrhage, and acute pancreatitis, required urgent surgical intervention. Given the complexity of her condition and the high risks associated with direct surgery, a staged approach was selected. The first stage involved using a novel FET prosthesis, the FROZENIX Partial ET (FPET), inserted via median sternotomy, followed by a left thoracotomy for non-deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (non-DHCA) descending aortic replacement. The surgery led to favorable outcomes without any major complications or sequelae. FPET offers distinct advantages in this complex scenario. Its design features a 2 cm stent-free distal section, which reduces the risk of distal stent graft-induced new entries (dSINEs) and simplifies anastomosis during the second stage of surgery. For patients with severe comorbidities and anatomical challenges that make the thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) unsuitable, a staged open surgical approach is a viable alternative, mitigating the risks linked to DHCA. This case underscores the utility of a staged surgical approach using FPET in managing complicated chronic type B aortic dissection in patients with significant comorbidities. The FPET prosthesis facilitates effective lesion control while minimizing the risk of dSINEs and streamlining subsequent surgical procedures, presenting a promising strategy for similar complex cases."

Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) following surgery for TAAD is rare but potentially fatal. A 69-year-old woman presented with sudden chest pain and was diagnosed with acute TAAD. Emergency surgery was performed, during which complications arose, including significant hemodynamic instability. Despite efforts to manage the patient's condition postoperatively, she developed hemodynamic instability and myocardial infarction, leading to cardiogenic shock. MINOCA was diagnosed based on clinical presentation, echocardiographic findings, and coronary angiography ruling out significant stenosis or occlusion. The patient's condition deteriorated despite aggressive treatment, ultimately resulting in death. MINOCA following surgery for TAAD is a rare but serious complication. Vigilant postoperative monitoring and timely intervention are essential for identifying and managing acute cardiac dysfunction in these patients. Further research is required to improve outcomes in this challenging clinical scenario."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a life-threatening cardiovascular emergency. Therefore, identifying modifiable risk factors for AAD is of great public health significance. An association between ambient temperature (AT) and AAD has been reported; however, not all findings have been elucidated. This study examined the association between AAD-related hospitalization and AT using data from the Japanese Registry of All Cardiac and Vascular Diseases Diagnostic Procedure Combination (JROAD-DPC), which is a nationwide claims-based database. This nationwide time-stratified case-crossover study evaluated data of hospitalized patients with AAD from 1119 certified hospitals between 2012 and 2020 using the JROAD-DPC database. Conditional logistic regression and distributed lag non-linear models were used to investigate the association between average daily temperature and AAD-related hospitalization. Among the 96 812 cases analysed, the exposure-response curve between AT and AAD-related hospitalization showed an increase in the odds ratio for lower temperatures, with a peak at time -10°C (odds ratio: 2.28, 95% confidence interval: 1.92-2.71, compared with that at 20°C). The effects of temperature on lag days 0 and 1 were also significant.Stratified analyses showed a greater association between AT and AAD-related hospitalization for the following variables: older age (≥75 years), female sex (44.4%, the mean age ± SD was 76 ± 12 years), low body mass index (<22), winter season, and warmer regions. Low AT is associated with an increased risk of AAD-related hospitalization. Several susceptible groups are affected by cold temperatures and have a higher risk of hospitalization. This study examined the association between hospitalization due to acute aortic dissection (AAD) and ambient temperature using data from the Japanese Registry of All Cardiac and Vascular Diseases Diagnostic Procedure Combination, which is a nationwide claims-based database. Key findings Low ambient temperature is associated with an increased risk of AAD-related hospitalization, with a greater association with older age and female sex. Other predisposing factors for the above association include lower body mass index, winter seasons, and warmer regions."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) is a severe emergency with high morbidity and mortality, necessitating strict monitoring and management. This retrospective study aimed to identify prognostic factors and establish predictive models for in-hospital mortality among AD patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We retrieved ICU admission records of AD patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV critical care data set and the eICU Collaborative Research Database. Functional data analysis was further applied to estimate continuous vital sign processes, and variables associated with in-hospital mortality were identified through univariate analyses. Subsequently, we employed multivariable logistic regression and machine learning techniques, including simple decision tree, random forest (RF), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to develop prognostic models for in-hospital mortality. Given 643 ICU admissions from MIMIC-IV and 501 admissions from eICU, 29 and 28 prognostic factors were identified from each database through univariate analyses, respectively. For prognostic model construction, 507 MIMIC-IV admissions were divided into 406 (80%) for training and 101 (20%) for internal validation, and 87 eICU admissions were included as an external validation group. Of the four models tested, the RF consistently exhibited the best performance among different variable subsets, boasting area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.870 and 0.850. The models highlighted the mean 24-h fluid intake as the most potent prognostic factor. The current prognostic models effectively forecasted in-hospital mortality among AD patients, and they pinpointed noteworthy prognostic factors, including initial blood pressure upon ICU admission and mean 24-h fluid intake."

    "abstract": "Endovascular repair of thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) in elective settings has demonstrated successful clinical outcomes. However, life-threatening conditions such as rupture are more often managed with open surgical repair due to the high complexity of arch endovascular repair, lack of available off-the-shelf devices, and limited long-term data. A 49-year-old female with a recent history of prior ascending aortic repair for Type A10 aortic dissection presented with chest pain and dyspnea. Chest computed tomography angiogram (CTA) revealed acute bilateral pulmonary emboli and a 6.2 cm post dissection aneurysm of the posterior aortic arch with the dissection extending to the right iliac artery. She was treated with thrombolysis and subsequently became hemodynamically unstable. Repeat CTA revealed a massive left hemithorax with concern for aortic arch rupture. Given significant cardiorespiratory compromise and recent open repair, she was considered unfit for redo open repair. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) with a physician-modified endograft (PMEG) was planned. An Alpha Zenith endograft was modified adding an internal branch for the innominate artery and a fenestration for the left common carotid artery. The left subclavian artery was occluded with a microvascular plug and coil embolization up to the level of the vertebral artery. TEVAR PMEG extension to the celiac artery was performed followed by deployment of a Zenith dissection stent to the aortic bifurcation. Completion angiogram demonstrated successful aneurysm exclusion and patency of target vessels. Endovascular treatment of ruptured TAA with PMEGs is feasible. This approach may be an alternative for unfit patients for open repair in emergent settings."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection remains a serious emergency in the field of cardiovascular medicine and a challenge for cardiothoracic surgeons. In the present study, we seek to compare the outcomes of different surgical techniques in the repair of type A acute aortic dissection. Between April 2015 and May 2023, 213 patients (82 women, aged: 63.9 ± 13.3 years) with acute aortic dissection (205 type A and 8 non-A-non-B dissections) underwent surgical treatment in our department. A total of 45 patients were treated with the frozen elephant trunk (FET) technique supported by the Thoraflex™ Hybrid prosthesis, 33 received total aortic arch replacement (TAR)-standard or conventional elephant trunk-treatment, and 135 were treated with hemiarch replacement (HR). Aortic arch surgery was performed in most patients under moderate hypothermic (28°C on average) circulatory arrest, with selective antegrade cerebral perfusion through the right axillary artery. The rates of early mortality were 17.8% (38 perioperative deaths) in the whole population, 8.9% in the FET group of patients, and 33% and 17% in the TAR and HR group of patients, respectively (P-value 0.025). The rate of spinal cord injury was 2.3% (five patients), and a paresis of recurrent laryngeal occurred in 3.7% of patients (seven patients, four were treated with FET). Permanent neurological dysfunction occurred in 27 patients (12.7%). After a mean follow-up of 3 years, the rate of mid-term mortality of discharged patients was 19.4% (34 deaths: 7 FET, 4 TAR, and 23 HR) and the overall mortality rate was 33.8% [72 deaths: 11 FET (24.4%); 15 TAR (45.4%); 46 HR (34.1%)]. A total of 8 patients (17.8%) in whom FET was applied received additional endovascular treatment in the descending aorta. In our institutional experience, we found that the frozen elephant trunk technique with a high-end Thoraflex Hybrid prosthesis proved its surgical suitability in the treatment of acute aortic dissection with favorable outcomes. The FET technique and our perioperative management led to comparable neurological outcomes and reduced mortality rates in these emergency cases."

    "abstract": "Stroke remains a serious complication after total arch replacement (TAR). To prevent this, deep hypothermia is commonly employed during TAR. We evaluated the effectiveness of cerebral protection using deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) during TAR with the arch-first technique, focusing particularly on patients with acute aortic dissection (AAD). This retrospective study included 109 consecutive patients with AAD who underwent emergency TAR using the arch-first technique under DHCA, and 147 patients with non-ruptured aneurysm who underwent scheduled TAR using the same technique between October 2009 and July 2022. We reviewed these patients for major adverse events, including stroke and 30-day mortality after surgery. We also analyzed the impact of clinical variables and anatomical features on the occurrence of newly developed stroke after TAR in patients with AAD. A newly developed stroke after TAR occurred in 11 (10.1%) patients with AAD. These were attributed to embolism in eight patients, malperfusion in two patients (including one who had been comatose), and low output syndrome in one patient. A stroke occurred in 3 (2.0%) patients with aneurysm, all due to embolism (P = 0.005). The DHCA time was 37 ± 7 minutes for patients with AAD and 36 ± 6 minutes for patients with aneurysm (P = 0.122). The 30-day mortality rate was 10 (9.2%) for patients with AAD and 2 (1.4%) for patients with aneurysm (P = 0.003). In our multivariable analysis, arch vessel dissection with a patent false lumen (double-barreled dissection) was the only significant predictor of newly developed stroke after TAR for AAD (odds ratio, 33.02; P < 0.001). Patients with aneurysm undergoing TAR using the arch-first technique under DHCA experienced significantly better outcomes, in terms of newly developed stroke and 30-day mortality, than those with AAD. Cerebral protection with DHCA during TAR using the arch-first technique continues to be a viable option. Newly developed stroke in patients undergoing TAR for AAD appears to be associated with air emboli deriving from the residual dissection with a patent false lumen in the repaired arch vessels."

All cases of NANB AAD (B 1-2 D) treated at our institution between January 2016 and December 2022 were reviewed. Morbidity, mortality, aortic-related reintervention, and remodeling were analyzed. Among 519 cases of acute aortic syndrome, n = 22 (4.2%) patients presented with NANB AAD (B 1-2 D) (n = 16,72.7% men, mean age 61.5 years+/14.7). Eleven cases were managed with best medical treatment (BMT) alone. Among them, one patient (9.1%) died suddenly 2 days after diagnosis for aortic rupture. Frozen elephant trunk procedure (FET) was required in the remaining 11 patients: 7 (31.8%) needed emergent operation for risks of impending aortic rupture or retrograde aortic dissection extension, and 4 (26.7%) underwent delayed surgery within a month from initial presentation. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 9.1% with both FET and BMT. At a median follow-up of 40 months (range 2 days-200 months) no other deaths occurred. A statistically significant differences in the rate of false lumen thrombosis (100% vs 55.5%, P = 0.033), and a significant positive aortic remodeling in zone 3 (P < 0.001) and 4 (P = 0.038) were reported in operated versus medically managed patients. The best treatment for NANB is not established. We advocate for medical stabilization with an operative approach that favors open surgery in the acute post dissection period, promotes aortic remodeling, and carries acceptable risk in centers where FET is performed routinely."

A 34-year-old healthy woman was performed cesarean section. After 2 weeks, she presented with chest pain and fever, followed by mild dysphagia and hoarseness. Laboratory findings showed C-reactive protein (CRP) 21.61 mg/dl and computed tomography (CT) demonstrated thickening of the vessel wall of mainly ascending aorta. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-position emission tomography (PET)/CT revealed high FDG uptake in the same areas. We diagnosed with TA and steroid pulse therapy was started. However, five days after treatment, the patient developed worsening symptoms of hoarseness. A contrast-enhanced CT showed Stanford A type dissection, and emergency artificial vessel replacement was performed. The specimen from surgical resection of the ascending aorta suggested active TA associated with dissection. The prednisolone dosage was gradually tapered with tocilizumab. Then, her symptoms and laboratory findings improved. It is important to recall the onset of TA and/or arterial dissection, when patients develop chest pain and hoarseness in the postpartum period."

    "abstract": "Reoperation following aortic root replacement is associated with significantly high operative mortality. Etiologies related to infection are known to increase the operative mortality rate more than other etiologies. In such a clinical setting, a sutureless valve could lower the operative mortality by shortening the cardiac arrest and the operative time. A 61-year-old male underwent emergent aortic root and total arch replacement with an open stent graft for acute type-A aortic dissection. A bioprosthetic valve was employed for aortic root replacement using the double-sewing ring technique. A fungal infection by Candida parapsilosis was postoperatively detected and improved with intravenous antifungal drug administration. However, he developed congestive heart failure one year later, and the blood cultures turned positive repeatedly for Candida parapsilosis. The prosthetic valve infection was suspected upon identifying vegetation on the bioprosthetic valve through transthoracic echocardiography. The computed tomography scan and operative findings confirmed that the infection was localized on the prosthetic valve. Consequently, the infected valve was removed without a vascular conduit, and a sutureless valve was implanted. The postoperative course was uneventful, without any evidence of recurrent fungal infection, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 28. Deploying a sutureless valve can facilitate a more straightforward and minimally invasive redo procedure. Preoperative computed tomography can predict the valve size, which is the key to implanting a sutureless valve successfully after the modified Bentall procedure."

This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 547 consecutive TBAD patients who underwent TEVAR treatment at our hospital. Feature variables were selected through LASSO regression and logistic regression analysis to construct a nomogram predictive model, and the model's performance was evaluated. The optimal cutoff value for the PIS risk nomogram score was calculated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, further dividing patients into high-risk group (HRG) and low-risk group (LRG), and comparing the short to midterm postoperative outcomes between the two groups. In the end, a total of 158 cases (28.9%) experienced PIS. Through LASSO regression analysis and multivariable logistic regression analysis, variables including age, emergency surgery, operative time, contrast medium volume, and number of main prosthesis stents were selected to construct the nomogram predictive model. The model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86 in the training set and 0.82 in the test set. Results from calibration curve, decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curve (CIC) demonstrated that the predictive model exhibited good performance and clinical utility. Furthermore, after comparing the postoperative outcomes of HRG and LRG patients, we found that the incidence of postoperative PIS significantly increased in HRG patients. The duration of ICU stay and mechanical assistance time was prolonged, and the incidence of postoperative type II entry flow and acute kidney injury (AKI) was higher. The risk of aortic-related adverse events (ARAEs) and major adverse events (MAEs) at the first and twelfth months of follow-up also significantly increased. However, there was no significant difference in the mortality rate during hospitalization. This study established a nomogram model for predicting the risk of PIS in patients with TBAD undergoing TEVAR.

    "abstract": "Gastric malabsorptive conditions may prevent patients from deriving benefit from orally administered medications intended for enteric absorption. While malabsorption is an increasingly common issue, current data on alternative oral options for agitation in these patients are very sparse. Sublingual (SL) asenapine is absorbed transmucosally, bypassing gut absorption, making it a viable consideration. We report on three patients, one with short bowel syndrome, one with viral gastritis, and one with aortic dissection who were trialed on SL asenapine for agitation after failing alternative antipsychotics. Two of these patients had an extensive history of psychiatric admissions for bipolar disorder and substance-induced psychosis. All three patients had significant reductions in agitation within 1-5 days, with no reported adverse effects. However, benefit of SL asenapine was hindered in two of these patients as they began inappropriately swallowing the medication, reducing bioavailability to nil. Clinicians should consider the use of SL asenapine for medically complex agitated patients where gastric absorption is questionable. There is an urgent need for guidelines on this matter, as well as more, alternative dosage forms for various medications that may help with agitation in this population."

    "abstract": "This case study presents an innovative endovascular approach using percutaneous gluteal artery access for embolizing the false lumen of a type B aortic dissection in a patient with Marfan syndrome. Following multiple complex surgeries, the patient developed an enlarging thoraco-abdominal aneurysm, necessitating an urgent intervention branched endoprosthesis despite persisting false lumen perfusion. Doppler ultrasound-guided percutaneous gluteal access was utilized for spiral-coil embolization of the false lumen. Successful embolization and exclusion of the aneurism, confirmed by follow-up angiography and computed tomography scans, demonstrated the technique's efficacy and safety. This approach underscores the need for innovative solutions addressing complex vascular pathologies in patients with Marfan."

    "title": "Acute Aortic Dissection Presenting as Rectal Tenesmus.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a life-threatening medical emergency that requires a high index of clinical suspicion to be diagnosed promptly. The variability in the clinical presentation of AAD has historically made it difficult to identify in the acute setting. There remains significant inter-physician variability in the use of imaging. The median time to diagnosis in the Emergency Department is over 4 h and AAD has a mortality rate of 68% when diagnosis is delayed by over 48 h after onset of symptoms. CASE REPORT We discuss a case of a 69-year-old woman presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms in the Emergency Department who ultimately was found to have AAD. The patient had delayed presentation by 12 h due to misattribution of her rectal tenesmus to irritable bowel syndrome. However, after a thorough history and physical exam, the Emergency Medicine physician appropriately risk-stratified the patient and correctly diagnosed her with a Stanford Type A aortic dissection using a computed tomography study of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with intravenous contrast. CONCLUSIONS AAD is an uncommon disease often requiring emergency intervention. We summarize the research and scoring systems and discuss the physical exam findings, comorbidities, imaging modalities, and risk stratification tools. Although imperfect, the Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score with the addition of a D-dimer test is currently the best-validated tool and should be an important part of clinical decision making prior to performing computed tomography imaging."

    "abstract": "This case report describes the perioperative course of a patient undergoing emergency repair of acute type A thoracic aortic dissection. Andexanet alfa was administered intraoperatively to obtain a dry operative field for right axillary artery exposure and cannulation. Andexanet alfa-induced heparin resistance resulted in cardiopulmonary bypass circuit and pericardial thrombosis requiring more than 400,000 units of unfractionated heparin and antithrombin III to overcome. Postoperatively, excessive chest tube output was observed secondary to protracted heparin rebound requiring continuous dosing of protamine. This case demonstrates the significant challenging perioperative, not just intraoperative, hazards associated with intraoperative andexanet alfa use during emergency cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass."

    "abstract": "BackgroundType A aortic dissection (TAAD) is an emergent condition that warrants immediate intervention. Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a prevalent disease associated with worse outcomes in various cardiovascular procedures. However, it remains unclear whether PAD influences outcomes of TAAD repair. This study aimed to undertake a population-based analysis to assess impact of PAD on in-hospital outcomes following TAAD repair.MethodsPatients underwent TAAD repair were identified in National Inpatient Sample from Q4 2015 to 2020. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to compare in-hospital outcomes between patients with and without PAD, adjusted for demographics, socioeconomic status, primary payer status, hospital characteristics, comorbidities, and transfer/admission status.Results1525 patients with PAD and 2757 non-PAD patients underwent TAAD. PAD patients had higher mortality (18.62% vs 13.17%, aOR = 1.287, p = .01), AKI (51.41% vs 47.48%, aOR = 1.222, p < .01), infection (10.69% vs 8.02%, aOR = 1.269, p = .03), and vascular complication (7.28% vs 3.77%, aOR = 1.846, p < .01) but lower risks of pericardial complications (15.21% vs 19.95%, aOR = 0.696, p < .01). In addition, patients with PAD had longer time from admission to operation (1.29 ± 3.95 vs 0.70 ± 2.09 days, p < .01), longer LOS (14.92 ± 13.98 vs 13.41 ± 11.66 days, p = .01), and higher hospital charge (499,064 ± 519,405 vs 409,754 ± 405,663 US dollars, p < .01).ConclusionPAD was independently associated with worse outcome after TAAD repair. The elevated mortality rate could be attributed to the delay in surgery, which may be related to preoperative peripheral malperfusion syndrome that is common in PAD patients. A balance between preoperative management and immediate TAAD repair might be essential to prevent the increased mortality risk from treatment delays among PAD patients."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the impact of urgency on early and midterm outcomes of the Candy-Plug (CP) technique for distal false lumen (FL) occlusion in thoracic endovascular aortic repair for aortic dissection. The CP registry was reviewed, and patients were categorized into elective and urgent/emergent groups for analysis. End points included technical success, clinical success, early (30-day) computed tomography angiography findings, early (30-day) mortality, adverse events, and aortic remodeling in patients with available computed tomography angiography follow-up and reintervention. A total of 155 patients received a custom-made CP, of whom 32 patients (44% male, mean age 61 ± 9 years) were treated urgently and 123 patients (63% male, mean age 62 ± 11 years) electively. The primary CP rate was higher in the urgent group (28/32, 88%, in the urgent group vs 96/123, 78%, in the elective group, P = .051). The mean contrast volume was higher in the urgent group (157 ± 56 mL in the urgent group vs 130 ± 71 mL in the elective group, P = .017). Technical success was achieved in all patients in both groups. Clinical success was achieved in 25 of 32 (78%) patients in the urgent group vs 113 and 123 (92%) in the elective group (P = .159). The early mortality rate was 13% (4 of 32 patients) in the urgent group vs 1% (1 of 123 patients) in the elective group (P = .120). There was no statistically significant difference regarding the early adverse events between the urgent and elective CP groups. Early aortic-related reinterventions were required in 6 of 32 (19%) patients in the urgent group vs 6 of 123 (5%) in the elective group (P = .094). Thoracic aortic aneurysm sac regression was lower in the urgent group (5/28, 18%, in the urgent group vs 63/114, 55%, in the elective group, P = .001). Stable thoracic aortic aneurysm sac was higher in the urgent group (22/28, 79%, in the urgent group vs 47/114, 41%, in the elective group, P = .000). An increase in thoracic aortic aneurysm sac occurred in 1 of 28 (4%) patients in the urgent group vs 4 of 114 (4%) patients in the elective group (P = .096). The urgent use of the CP technique for distal FL occlusion in aortic dissection was feasible and effective. The decrease in aortic FL sac diameter may be affected by the urgent use of CP due to limited sizing availability. However, it achieved a high rate of aortic remodeling."

A quality improvement report. A total of 142 patients with acute aortic dissection treated before and after the optimization of the chest pain center process in our hospital were included. According to their admission time: the group before the optimization process was designated as the control group (66 cases) and the group after the optimization process was the intervention group (76 cases). The control group received conventional emergency treatment, while the intervention group received treatment through a multidisciplinary cooperative first aid model. The treatment times for both groups were compared: the time from first medical contact(FMC) to completion of an electrocardiogram (ECG), the diagnosis time, and the time spent in the emergency department. The research findings revealed that the intervention group had significantly shorter times for FMC-to-ECG, diagnosis time, and emergency stay compared to the control group (P < 0.001). Our findings indicate that by optimizing the multidisciplinary cooperative first aid model and procedures, the treatment of patients has indeed been effectively ensured, achieving safety outcomes. For chest pain centers, we suggest that to use multidisciplinary cooperative first aid model to get repaid and definite diagnosis of various causes of chest pain. A bedside transthoracic echocardiography is recommended to use in order to identify AD before proceeding with further treatment."

The objective of this study is to describe the prevalence of POCUS findings and ADRS in this population. This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with acute type A AD as confirmed on computed tomography scan over a 12-year period from 2008 to 2020, with a subgroup analysis of patients who received POCUS in the emergency department. ADRS was calculated and POCUS findings were reviewed. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the distribution of POCUS findings. Ninety-one patients met inclusion criteria. POCUS was performed in 41 but only 35 had images of adequate quality for inclusion. Of the POCUS images available, 30/35 (86%) patients had a POCUS finding consistent with dissection and 5/35 (14%) had no findings on POCUS. Twelve percent (11/91) of patients had ADRS = 0. Two patients with ADRS = 0 received POCUS, and one patient had no findings on POCUS. Although POCUS provides rapid information in the diagnosis of type A AD, 14% of patients with images available for review had no findings on POCUS. Of the whole cohort, 12% had an ADRS = 0.

    "abstract": "The objective of the present study is to clarify safety and efficacy of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), excluding the primary entry in the descending aorta, for type-B0,D acute aortic dissection (TB0,DAAD) (so-called retrograde type-A acute aortic dissection). Forty-six patients with hyperacute-phase (within 2 days after the onset) type-A acute aortic dissection (TAAAD) and TB0,DAAD underwent urgent (on the admission or next day) intervention (TEVAR or conventional surgical aortic repair [CSAR]) for 2 years. Results of TEVAR for TB0,DAAD were compared with those of CSAR for TAAAD. Outcomes included 30-day mortality, aortic reintervention, and major complications (stroke and paraplegia/paraparesis). Details of TEVAR were also analyzed. Seven patients with TB0,DAAD and 39 patients with TAAAD underwent respectively urgent TEVAR and CSAR. Aortic reintervention was significantly more frequent in the TEVAR than CSAR group (28.6% vs. 0%, P < 0.01). There was no difference in incidence of death and stroke between the TEVAR and CSAR group. All the 7 patients survived and 5 of the 7 (71.4%) patients were relieved of aortic reintervention for 30 days following TEVAR. One patient, however, underwent aortic arch replacement on postoperative day (POD) 1 owing to the patent and nonshrinking ascending false lumen (FL). The entry existed in the aortic arch. Another patient underwent ascending and transverse aortic replacement with frozen elephant trunk on POD13 due to proximal stent graft-induced new entry irrespective of the thrombosed and shrinking ascending FL. Because of the patent and nonshrinking ascending FL, 1 patient underwent additional TEVAR for the residual entry in the distal descending thoracic aorta on POD33 and subsequently ascending aortic replacement 4 months later. No entry was detected in the ascending or transverse aorta. The ascending FL in the other 4 patients was thrombosed early, shrinking gradually, and disappeared at last following TEVAR. Urgent TEVAR for TB0,DAAD may be alternative to CSAR in selected cases. Accurate diagnosis of the primary entry location on preinterventional computed tomography scans for exclusion of the entry and cautious selection and delivery of a stent graft to prevent stent graft-induced new entry or endoleak are requisite for success of the procedure, remodeling of the FL, and satisfactory prognosis."

    "abstract": "The surgical outcomes of aortic root replacement for Stanford type A acute aortic dissection( AAAD) remain unacceptable with a 30-day mortality rate of 20%. Additionally, in young patients requiring aortic root replacement for AAAD, the preservation of native valve is desirable, yet challenging to achieve in emergent surgery with poor preoperative status. Ideally, we aim to avoid aortic root replacement whenever possible, opting instead for partial remodeling even in cases necessitating incision into the aortic root. We present our surgical outcomes in the strategy for aortic root pathology due to AAAD. We conducted an analysis of 517 cases of AAAD surgery from 2002 to 2023, wherein 499 cases( 96%) underwent aortic root preservation, 10 cases( 1.9%) underwent partial remodeling, and 8 cases( 1.5%)necessitated emergent aortic root replacement. Of these, 13 cases underwent aortic root replacement after AAAD repair( 8 David procedures and 5 Bentall procedures), all demonstrating favorable surgical outcomes, including long-term results. We believe that this strategy for aortic root pathology holds significant merit, particularly in AAAD in young patients with enlarged aortic root."

A narrative overview was performed, providing an updated review of renal and genitourinary ultrasound for emergency and critical care healthcare providers, emphasizing its advantages and the latest advances in the field. A thorough summary that can be utilized as a guide for emergency and critical care healthcare providers is presented. The daily hemodynamic management of critically ill patients involves the implementation of new protocols, such as VexUS or the evaluation of the renal resistance index. The role of ultrasound in managing acute nephropathy and genitourinary issues is increasingly crucial given its bedside availability, thus this imaging modality not only facilitates the initiation of therapeutic interventions but also provides swift prognostic insights that are vital to provide tailored patient care. As further advances in ultrasound will arise, it is important for healthcare providers to foster the use of these technologies capable of improving patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "A 60-year-old man with hypertension and dyslipidemia complained of chest pain upon ascending from a maximum depth of 27 meters while diving. After reaching the shore, his chest pain persisted, and he called an ambulance. When a physician checked him on the doctor's helicopter, his electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal, and there were no bubbles in his inferior vena cava or heart on a portable ultrasound examination. The physician still suspected that he had acute coronary syndrome instead of decompression illness; therefore, he was transported to our hospital. After arrival at the hospital, standard cardiac echography showed a flap in the ascending aorta. Immediate enhanced computed tomography revealed Stanford type A aortic dissection. The patient obtained a survival outcome after emergency surgery. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of aortic dissection potentially associated with scuba diving. It highlights the importance of considering aortic dissection in patients with sudden-onset chest pain during physical activity. In addition, this serves as a reminder that symptoms during scuba diving are not always related to decompression. This report also suggests the usefulness of on-site ultrasound for the differential diagnosis of decompression sickness from endogenous diseases that induce chest pain. Further clinical studies of this management approach are warranted."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) remains a difficult diagnosis in the emergency setting. Despite its rare occurrence, it is a life-threatening pathology that, if missed, is typically fatal. Previous studies have documented minimal improvement in timely and accurate diagnoses despite the advancement of computed tomography. Previous literature has highlighted aortic dissections as a major cause of serious misdiagnosis-related harm. The aim of this article is to review the available literature on AD, discussing the diversity in presentations and the prevalence of historical and exam features to better aid in the diagnosis of AD. AD remains a difficult diagnosis, even with the widespread prevalence of computed tomography angiography usage. No single feature of the history or physical examination is enough to raise suspicion. The diagnosis should be strongly considered in any patient with chest pain that is severe and unexplained by other findings or testing. Those who do not present with acute pain are often complicated by neurologic deficits, hypotension, or syncope. These patients suffer from a change in mental status limiting their ability to participate in the history and physical examination and have a higher rate of complications and mortality. An educated understanding of the atypical presentations of aortic dissection helps the clinician to realistically rank it on the differential diagnosis, culminating in judicious use of definitive imaging."

In this case report, we emphasize the diagnostic importance of multimodality imaging and the need for additional procedures, such as tissue biopsy, in a case with a primary cardiac lymphoma presenting with cardiac tamponade. An 80-year-old male was admitted to the emergency department with a life-threatening tamponade demanding immediate sternotomy. Pre-operative echocardiography unveiled pericardial effusion and a thickened apex. While computed tomography ruled out an aortic dissection, surgery revealed an unexpected vascular-rich mass at the right ventricle and apex, too perilous for biopsy. Post-operative imaging misinterpreted this mass as a benign haematoma. Subsequently, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit, but after a conservative treatment strategy, the patient died. An autopsy revealed a primary CDLBCL. This case demonstrates the deceptive nature of primary CDLBCL, often complicated by cardiac tamponade. It underscores the pivotal role of pathologic assessment, even amidst the perils of sternotomy, to determine the origin of abnormal cardiac masses. A heightened awareness among physicians is imperative, for such elusive diagnoses may slip by, with potentially fatal outcomes."

Atypical presentations can lead to significant delays in diagnosis and increased mortality rates. Our case illustrates that isolated painless syncope can be a rare presenting symptom of acute aortic dissection type A. What is unique about our case is the limited extension of the dissection tear and the availability of Holter monitoring during the syncopal episode. This constellation provides insight into the pathophysiological mechanism of the syncope in this patient. Mechanisms of syncope related to acute aortic dissection are diverse. We show that vasovagal activation not related to pain can be the underlying mechanism of syncope in acute aortic dissection type A. Although excessive vasovagal tone in the setting of aortic dissection has been hypothesized in the past, it has never been as clearly illustrated as in the present case. This also highlights the challenge in risk stratification of syncope in the emergency department."

The main objective was to identify potential improvements in managing this life-threatening cardiovascular condition and to provide evidence-based recommendations to optimise outcomes. We developed a predictive model along patient pathways to estimate the burden of ATAAD through the years of life lost (YLLs) metric. The model was created based on a systematic review of the literature and was parameterised using demographic data from the German healthcare environment. The model was designed to allow interactive simulation of different scenarios resulting from changes in key impact factors. The study was conducted using data from the German healthcare environment and results from the literature review. The study included a comprehensive modelling of ATAAD cases in Germany but did not directly involve participants. There were no specific interventions applied in this study based on the modelling design. The single outcome measure was the estimation of YLL due to ATAAD in Germany. Our model estimated 102 791 YLL per year for ATAAD in Germany, with 62 432 and 40 359 YLL for men and women, respectively. Modelling an improved care setting yielded 93 191 YLL or 9.3% less YLL compared with the current standard while a worst-case scenario resulted in 113 023 or 10.0% more YLL. The model is accessible at https://acuteaorticdissection.com/ to estimate custom scenarios. Our study provides an evidence-based approach to estimating the burden of ATAAD and identifying potential improvements in the management of pathways. This approach can be used by healthcare decision-makers to inform policy changes aimed at optimising patient outcomes. By considering patient-centred approaches in any healthcare environment, the model has the potential to improve efficient care for patients suffering from ATAAD."

Indication for invasive treatment: In addition to the conventional complicated cases (rupture or malperfusion case), the indication for invasive treatment now includes cases with refractory hypertension, persistent or recurrent pain, large aortic diameter, and other conditions that are considered to have a poor prognosis with conservative treatment. Treatment methods: TEVAR is the first choice for acute, subacute, and early chronic-stage treatment, and when this is not possible, other techniques (fenestration and graft replacement) are chosen.

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) is a catastrophic life-threatening cardiovascular emergency with a 1-2% per hour mortality rate post-diagnosis, characterized physiologically by the separation of aortic wall layers. AD initially presents as intense pain that can then radiate to the back, arms, neck, or jaw along with neurological deficits like difficulty in speaking, and unilateral weakness in some patients. This spectrum of clinical features associated with AD is often confused with acute myocardial infarction, hence leading to a delay in AD diagnosis. Cardiac and vascular biomarkers are structural proteins and microRNAs circulating in the bloodstream that correlate to tissue damage and their levels become detectable even before symptom onset. Timely diagnosis of AD using biomarkers, in combination with advanced imaging diagnostics, will significantly improve prognosis by allowing earlier vascular interventions. This comprehensive review aims to investigate emerging biomarkers in the diagnosis of AD, as well as provide future directives for creating advanced diagnostic tools and imaging techniques."

    "title": "Intestinal Fatty Acid Binding Protein as a Predictor of Early Mesenteric Injury Preceding Clinical Presentation: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Diagnosing non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia (NOMI) in patients is complicated, due to poor signs and symptoms and non-specific laboratory tests, leading to a high mortality rate. This case study presents the rare case of a patient who developed mesenteric ischaemia after an emergency thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) for a type B aortic dissection (TBAD) and peri-operative cardiogenic shock. Study outcomes revealed that intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) identified early mucosal damage two days before the clinical presentation. A 43 year old male patient was admitted to the emergency department with an acute TBAD and a dissection of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), for which TEVAR was performed with additional stent placement in the SMA. Peri-operatively, the patient went into cardiogenic shock with a sustained period of hypotension. Post-operatively, the plasma I-FABP levels were measured prospectively, revealing an initial increase on post-operative day five (551.1 pg/mL), which continued beyond day six (610.3 pg/mL). On post-operative day seven, the patient developed a fever and demonstrated signs of peritonitis and bowel perforation. He underwent an emergency laparotomy, followed by an ileocaecal resection (<100 cm) with a transverse ileostomy. Pathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of mesenteric ischaemia. The diagnosis of NOMI in critically ill patients is often complicated, and the currently available diagnostic markers lack the specificity and sensitivity to detect early intestinal injury. This case report highlights that elevated I-FABP in plasma levels may indicate the presence of early mesenteric injury. Further research needs to be conducted before I-FABP can be applied in daily practice."

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) continue to be a significant contributor to global mortality, imposing a substantial burden and emphasizing the urgent need for disease control to save lives and prevent disability. With advancements in technology and scientific research, novel mechanisms underlying CVDs have been uncovered, leading to the exploration of promising treatment targets aimed at reducing the global burden of the disease. One of the most intriguing findings is the relationship between CVDs and gut microbiota, challenging the traditional understanding of CVDs mechanisms and introducing the concept of the gut-heart axis. The gut microbiota, through changes in microbial compositions and functions, plays a crucial role in influencing local and systemic effects on host physiology and disease development, with its metabolites acting as key regulators. In previous studies, we have emphasized the importance of specific metabolites such as betaine, putrescine, trimethylamine oxide, and N,N,N-trimethyl-5-aminovaleric acid in the potential treatment of CVDs. Particularly noteworthy is the gut microbiota-associated metabolite succinate, which has garnered significant attention due to its involvement in various pathophysiological pathways closely related to CVDs pathogenesis, including immunoinflammatory responses, oxidative stress, and energy metabolism. Furthermore, we have identified succinate as a potential biomarker, highlighting its therapeutic feasibility in managing aortic dissection and aneurysm. This review aims to comprehensively outline the characteristics of succinate, including its biosynthetic process, summarize the current evidence linking it to CVDs causation, and emphasize the host-microbial crosstalk involved in modulating CVDs. The insights presented here offer a novel paradigm for future management and control of CVDs."

    "abstract": "Stanford Type A Aortic Dissection (TAAD) is characterized by a high in-hospital mortality rate and necessitates urgent surgical intervention. While socioeconomic status is known to influence health-care outcomes, its specific association with TAAD remains underexplored. This study aimed to investigate the population-based association between socioeconomic status with TAAD repair outcomes using a national registry. Patients who had TAAD repair were identified in National Inpatient Sample from Q4 2015-2020. National Inpatient Sample stratified estimated median household income of residents within a patient's ZIP code. Patients residing in neighborhoods of incomes in the lowest and highest quartiles were selected as the study cohorts. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to compare in-hospital outcomes, adjusted for demographics, comorbid conditions, hospital characteristics, primary payer status, and transfer status. Compared to patients from high-income neighborhoods, patients in low-income communities had higher risks of mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.45, P = 0.01), acute kidney injury (aOR 1.225, P = 0.03), and infection (aOR 1.474, P = 0.02), as well as longer wait from admission to operation (24.96 ± 2.64 versus 18.00 ± 1.92 h, P = 0.03) and longer length of stay (15.06 ± 0.38 versus 13.80 ± 0.36 d, P = 0.01). In contrast, patients from low-income communities had less risk of hemorrhage/hematoma (aOR 0.691, P < 0.01) and lower total hospital charge (428,746 ± 10,658 versus 487,017 ± 16,770 US dollars, P < 0.01). Evidence suggests patients from lower-income communities may have limited access to health care and treatment delays, leading to higher mortality and complications. The underlying reasons for these disparities in economically disadvantaged communities warrant further investigation, which could focus on health-care accessibility, timely detection of TAAD, and prompt transfers to specialized centers."

    "abstract": "Marfan Syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease caused by pathogenetic variants in the FBN1 gene. The progressive dilatation of the aorta and the potential risk of acute aortic syndromes influence the prognosis of these patients. We aim to describe population characteristics, long-term survival, and re-intervention patterns in patients who underwent aortic surgery with a previously confirmed clinical diagnosis of Marfan Syndrome in a middle-income country. A retrospective single-center case series study was conducted. All Marfan Syndrome patients who underwent aortic procedures from 2004 until 2021 were included. Qualitative variables were frequency-presented, while quantitative ones adopted mean ± standard deviation. A subgroup analysis between elective and emergent procedures was conducted. Kaplan-Meier plots depicted cumulative survival and re-intervention-free. Control appointments and government data tracked out-of-hospital mortality. Fifty patients were identified. The mean age was 38.79 ± 14.41 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 2:1. Common comorbidities included aortic valve regurgitation (66%) and hypertension (50%). Aortic aneurysms were observed in 64% without dissection and 36% with dissection. Surgical procedures comprised elective (52%) and emergent cases (48%). The most common surgery performed was the David procedure (64%), and the Bentall procedure (14%). The in-hospital mortality rate was 4%. Complications included stroke (10%), and acute kidney injury (6%). The average follow-up was 8.88 ± 5.78 years. Survival rates at 5, 10, and 15 years were 89%, 73%, and 68%, respectively. Reintervention rates at 1, 2.5, and 5 years were 10%, 14%, and 17%, respectively. The emergent subgroup was younger (37.58 ± 14.49 years), had the largest number of Stanford A aortic dissections, presented hemodynamic instability (41.67%), and had a higher requirement of reinterventions in the first 5 years of follow-up (p = 0.030). In our study, surveillance programs played a pivotal role in sustaining high survival rates and identifying re-intervention requirements. However, challenges persist, as 48% of the patients required emergent surgery. Despite not affecting survival rates, a greater requirement for reinterventions was observed, emphasizing the necessity of timely diagnosis. Enhanced educational initiatives for healthcare providers and increased patient involvement in follow-up programs are imperative to address these concerns."

    "abstract": "Stanford Type A Aortic Dissection (TAAD) is an emergent condition with high in-hospital mortality. Gender disparity in TAAD has been a topic of ongoing debate. This study aimed to conduct a population-based examination of gender disparities in short-term TAAD outcomes using the National/Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database, the largest all-payer database in the US. Patients undergoing TAAD repair were identified in NIS from the last quarter of 2015-2020. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to compare in-hospital outcomes between male and female patients, adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, hospital characteristics, primary payer status, and transfer status. There were 1454 female and 2828 male patients identified who underwent TAAD repair. Female patients presented with TAAD were at a more advanced mean age (64.03 ± 13.81 vs. 58.28 ± 13.43 years, p < 0.01) and had greater comorbid burden. Compared to male patients, female patients had higher risks of in-hospital mortality (17.88% vs. 13.68%, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.266, p = 0.01). In addition, female patients had higher pericardial complications (20.29% vs. 17.22%, aOR = 1.227, p = 0.02), but lower acute kidney injury (AKI; 39.96% vs. 53.47%, aOR = 0.476, p < 0.01) and venous thromboembolism (VTE; 1.38% vs. 2.65%, aOR = 0.517, p = 0.01). Female patients had comparable time from admission to operation and transfer-in status, longer hospital stays, but fewer total hospital expenses. Female patients were 1.27 times as likely to die in-hospital after TAAD repair but had less AKI and VTE. While there is no evidence suggesting delay in TAAD repair for female patients, the disparities might stem from other differences such as in care provided or intrinsic physiological variations."

This study aims to investigate the relationship between SIRI and short-term and long-term prognosis in patients with acute type A aortic dissection (AAAD) underwent surgical treatment. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with AAAD who underwent emergency surgical treatment at our center. Through multifactorial logistics regression analysis and cox proportional hazards regression analysis, we identified SIRI as an independent risk factor for major adverse events (MAEs) and long-term aorta-related adverse events (ARAEs) post-surgery. The optimal cutoff value of preoperative SIRI was determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and patients were divided into low SIRI group and high SIRI group. The prognostic outcomes at different time points post-surgery for the two groups of patients were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and the significance was determined by log-rank test. A total of 691 AAAD patients were included in this study. Among them, 50 patients (7.2%) died within 30 days post-surgery, and 175 patients (25.3%) experienced MAEs. A total of 641 patients were followed up, with an average follow-up time of 33.5 ± 17.5 months, during which 113 patients (17.6%) experienced ARAEs. The results of multifactorial logistics regression analysis and cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that SIRI was an independent risk factor for postoperative MAEs (OR=3.148, 95%CI[1.650-6.006], p<0.001) and ARAEs (HR=2.248, 95%CI[1.050-4.809], p<0.037). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that the MAEs-free survival in the high SIRI group was significantly lower than that in the low SIRI group, and a similar trend was observed in the ARAEs-free survival during follow-up (log-rank test, p<0.001). Preoperative SIRI is significantly associated with the short-term and long-term prognosis of AAAD patients underwent emergency open surgery, demonstrating its valuable prognostic value. Therefore, preoperative SIRI is a reliable biological marker that can serve as a valuable tool for preoperative risk stratification and decision management."

    "abstract": "Objectives: The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the results of complementary TEVAR following the frozen elephant trunk (FET) procedure for patients with residual type A aortic dissection (rTAAD) in terms of technical feasibility, safety and mid-term outcomes. Methods: This was a retrospective single-centre analysis of patients who received TEVAR after FET for rTAAD from January 2012 up to December 2021. The primary endpoint was technical success. Safety parameters included 30-day/in-hospital morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, mid-term clinical and morphological outcomes were evaluated. Results: Among 587 TEVAR procedures, 60 patients (11 with connective tissue disorders) who received TEVAR after FET for rTAAD were identified. The median interval between FET and TEVAR was 28.5 months. Indications for TEVAR after FET were true lumen collapse distal to FET prosthesis (n = 7), dSINE (n = 2), planned completion (n = 13) and aortic diameter progression (n = 38). In forty-seven patients, TEVAR was performed in an elective setting; eight and six patients were operated on in an urgent or emergency setting, respectively. All TEVAR procedures were successfully completed. The 30-day mortality and spinal cord ischemia rates were 1.7%. During a median follow-up of 37 months, two further patients died. Nine patients had to undergo a further aortic intervention: fenestrated stent-graft (n = 3) or open repair of the infrarenal abdominal aorta (n = 6). Conclusions: Complementary TEVAR following FET for rTAAD showed excellent technical success and low perioperative risk, supporting the feasibility and safety of this strategy. Despite the favourable mid-term survival, certain patients might require a further aortic procedure."

    "title": "Exploring Acute Kidney Injury Following Aortic Dissection: A Comprehensive Review of Machine Learning Models for Predicting Risk, Management Strategies, Complications, and Racial and Gender Disparities.",
    "abstract": "Both types of aortic dissection (AD), Stanford type A and type B, can result in complications such as acute kidney injury (AKI) and aortic rupture. Renal complications in AD arise from compromised renal perfusion affecting the renal arteries. Understanding the intricate connection between AD and AKI is crucial for navigating the complexities of tailored treatment and formulating specific management plans. Concerning machine learning models, in patients with type A aortic dissection, factors such as decreased platelet count on admission, increased D-dimer level, longer cardiopulmonary bypass duration, elevated white blood cell levels, the need for blood transfusion, longer aortic clamp time, extended surgery duration, advanced age, and an elevated body mass index were positively associated with the development of AKI. For the risk of AKI after type B aortic dissection, elevated Nt-pro brain natriuretic peptide, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, elevated admission systolic blood pressure, and a higher contrast agent requirement during operative repair were found to predict the risk. Male gender was associated with a higher risk of AKI, and nonwhite race was linked to a higher risk of AKI, a greater likelihood of requiring more urgent procedures, and lower levels of insurance coverage. The treatment of AKI following AD requires a multifaceted approach. Identifying and addressing the underlying cause, such as low blood pressure, renal artery involvement, or medication-induced injury, is crucial for effective management and preventing further kidney damage. Maintaining proper fluid balance is essential for improving renal perfusion, but careful monitoring is necessary to avoid complications. The evolving landscape of research, particularly in biomarkers and AI programs, reveals a promising role in predicting the risk for and managing AKI post-AD."

We present our experience of using MANTA closure device with a retrospective evaluation of its safety and efficacy, in the elective setting, and in the emergent setting for ruptured aortic aneurysm.Design and methodsBetween Feb 2021 and May 2023 a total of 75 EVAR procedures were closed with a Manta device. Data was collected prospectively and analysed retrospectively. In 75 patients, 128 CFAs were closed with a Manta closure device including 4 emergent ruptured aneurysms.Results67 male and 8 female patients with a median age of 77 years had percutaneous EVAR using Manta as a closure device. 128 CFAs were closed with Manta closure device. 3% (4/128) had deployment failures, with three requiring surgical cut down and closure. In one patient, a second Manta device deployment achieved satisfactory haemostasis. Three deployments were complicated by pseudoaneurysms of the CFA, all requiring no further interventions/treatment. No death related to severe haemorrhage from device failure. The pre- and post-procedure CFA puncture site AP diameter was recorded in a total of 106 cases with appropriate follow-up. 66% of these (70/106) had no reduction in CFA diameter post Manta closure. 34% (36/106) had some reduction of vessel AP size CFA post EVAR. No adverse features or further treatment was required due to reduction of vessel diameter in these cases (ongoing yearly surveillance).ConclusionsManta closure device is safe and easy to deploy with an overall success rate of 97%. There is a short learning curve. Ultrasound assessment and precise puncture at the healthy section of femoral artery are the key to achieve successful haemostasis with Manta closure device. Our findings suggest there is an association of non-clinically significant mild reduction in CFA vessel AP diameter post Manta closure device, which does not require further intervention."

Patients who were diagnosed with ATAAD and underwent emergency surgery within 48 hours of onset at our hospital between January 2015 and December 2021 were included in this study. The primary endpoint of this study was postoperative in-hospital mortality (POIM). The data of the survivors and non-survivors were retrospectively compared analyses. A total of 557 ATAAD patients were included, with 505 survivors and 52 non-survivors. The preoperative BA-R of the non-survivor group was significantly higher than that of the survivor group (P < 0.001). Univariate regression analysis showed that preoperative BA-R, serum creatinine level, SA level, D-dimer level, age, myocardial ischemia, cerebral ischemia, and aortic clamp time were risk factors for POIM. In addition, multivariable regression analysis showed that preoperative BA-R ≥ 0.155 mmol/g was a risk factor for POIM (odds ratio, 6.815 [3.582-12.964]; P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that the cut-off point for preoperative BA-R was ≥0.155 mmol/g (area under the curve =0.874). The sensitivity and specificity of preoperative BA-R in predicting the POIM of patients who underwent emergency surgery for ATAAD were 84.6% and 71.3%, respectively (95% confidence interval, 0.829-0.919; P < 0.001). In conclusion, Preoperative BA-R is a simple, rapid, and potentially useful prognostic indicator of POIM in patients with ATAAD.

    "abstract": "Aggressive resection/exclusion of the primary entry in the descending aorta remains controversial in older patients with acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD). We investigated the effect of residual primary entry in the descending aorta in younger and older groups. Patients with ATAAD who underwent emergency operation (n = 1103) were divided into younger (<70 years; n = 681) and older (≥70 years; n = 422) cohorts. Each cohort was further divided into groups with or without residual primary entry in the descending aorta. After propensity score matching, 179 and 71 matched pairs were obtained in the younger and older cohorts, respectively. Surgical outcomes were compared between the residual and nonresidual groups in each age cohort. In the younger cohort, the cumulative incidence rate of distal aortic events was significantly higher in the residual than in the nonresidual group at 10 years (35% [95% CI, 27%-44%] vs 22% [95% CI, 15%-31%], P = .001). However, in the older group, residual or nonresidual primary entry did not affect the rates at 10 years (11% [95% CI, 5%-20%] vs 9% [95% CI, 4%-17%], P = .75). Multivariate analysis identified age <70 years (hazard ratio, 2.188; 95% CI, 1.493-3.205; P < .001) and residual primary entry at the descending aorta (hazard ratio, 2.142; 95% CI, 1.559-2.943; P < .001) as significant predictors for distal aortic events. Aggressive resection/exclusion of the primary entry in the descending aorta should be considered for patients aged <70 years to avoid distal aortic events; however, it might not always be appropriate for the older patients ≥70 years."

We report the case of a 53-year-old male with a history of ascending aortic replacement for acute aortic dissection, who presented to our institution in shock. The initial electrocardiogram revealed the aVR sign, consisting of ST-segment elevation in lead aVR and ST-segment depression in leads II, III, aVF, and V3-6, leading to the initiation of salvage veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) due to deteriorating hemodynamics. The aVR sign resolved shortly after ECMO initiation, and hemodynamics stabilized even with reduced ECMO flow. Subsequent coronary angiography showed no impaired coronary perfusion, whereas contrast-enhanced CT revealed severe supra-valvular stenosis due to pseudoaneurysm-induced graft kinking. The patient was then managed with emergency surgery for the pseudoaneurysm. In this report, we encountered a salvaged case of critical circulatory failure presenting with the aVR sign due to severe graft kinking caused by pseudoaneurysm formation."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection is a severe cardiovascular disease characterized by rapid onset and high mortality. Traditionally, urgent open aortic repair is performed after admission to prevent aortic rupture and death. However, when combined with malperfusion syndrome, the low perfusion of the superior mesenteric artery can further lead to intestinal necrosis, significantly impacting the surgery's prognosis and potentially resulting in adverse consequences, bringing. This presents great significant challenges in treatment. Based on recent domestic and international research literature, this paper reviews the mechanism, current treatment approaches, and selection of surgical methods for poor organ perfusion caused by acute type A aortic dissection. The literature review findings suggest that central aortic repair can be employed for the treatment of acute type A aortic dissection with inadequate perfusion of the superior mesenteric artery. The superior mesenteric artery can be windowed and (/or) stented, followed by delayed aortic repair. Priority should be given to revascularization of the superior mesenteric artery, followed by central aortic repair. During central aortic repair, direct blood perfusion should be performed on the distal true lumen of the superior mesenteric artery, leading to resulting in favorable therapeutic outcomes. The research results indicate that even after surgical aortic repair, intestinal ischemic necrosis may still occur. In such cases, prompt laparotomy and necessary necrotic bowel resection are crucial for saving the patient's life."

    "abstract": "A type A aortic dissection (TAAD) is a dangerous condition requiring emergency surgery. Due to the similarity of the symptoms of cerebral malperfusion in TAAD and the signs of ischemic stroke, a differential diagnosis of these diseases is not always available. Patients with TAAD after cerebral malperfusion can have a neurological deficit. Thrombolysis is performed in this case. It can worsen the patient's condition and increase the risk of mortality and disability. The aim of the study is to evaluate the new approach to restoring cerebral perfusion during aortic dissection. This approach includes endovascular recanalization and carotid stenting. Two clinical cases of TAAD complicated by cerebral malperfusion are described. The first patient is 73 years old and was admitted as planned to perform transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for grade III aortic stenosis. The patient underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) on the second day after admission. The second patient is 60 years old and was hospitalized by an ambulance with strong hypertension and ischemia. The surgical correction of aortic dissection was postponed until the neurological status assessment in both patients. The surgery to correct the aorta dissection was deemed inappropriate. The carotid arteries have been reanalyzed, and cerebral perfusion has been restored in a short time in both patients. Acute bilateral internal carotid occlusion is a potentially fatal TAAD outcome. Emergency endovascular recanalization and carotid stenting may be considered one of the few ways to restore cerebral perfusion."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) presents a critical medical emergency characterized by a tear in the aortic wall, necessitating prompt recognition and management to mitigate catastrophic complications. Despite advancements in medical technology and therapeutic interventions, AD remains a formidable challenge, often resulting in severe morbidity and mortality. This narrative review provides a comprehensive overview of AD, encompassing its clinical presentation, diagnostic modalities, and management strategies, while also exploring emerging trends and innovations in its management. Genetic predispositions significantly influence AD pathogenesis, with over 30 contributory genes identified, emphasizing the importance of genetic screening and counseling. Classification systems such as Stanford and DeBakey, alongside their revised counterparts, aid in categorizing AD and guiding treatment decisions. Advancements in diagnostic imaging, including transesophageal echocardiography and computed tomography angiography, have enhanced diagnostic precision, augmented by artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. Pharmacological innovations focus on optimizing medical therapy, while surgical and endovascular approaches offer minimally invasive treatment options. Hybrid procedures and aortic valve-sparing techniques broaden treatment avenues, while bioresorbable stent grafts hold promise for tissue regeneration. Collaborative efforts and ongoing research are essential to address remaining challenges and improve outcomes in managing AD. This review contributes to the understanding of AD's complexity and facilitates informed decision-making in clinical practice, underscoring the imperative for continued innovation and research in AD management."

    "abstract": "We discuss a rare case of Stanford type A aortic dissection (TAAD) occurring several months after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) of the abdominal aortic and the common iliac artery (CIA) aneurysms. The patient underwent urgent surgery for TAAD treatment but died on the table due to intractable bleeding. We conclude that TAAD was likely unrelated to the initial EVAR procedure but rather to atherosclerosis, hypertension, and prior aortic valve replacement. Only a few cases in the literature report TAAD and total collapse of the abdominal aortic stent graft."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection is often misdiagnosed as a result of its atypical presentations. It affects 4000 patients a year in the UK of all ages, not just older patients, with increasing numbers of cases expected in the future because of the ageing population. Dissection of the aortic wall leads to sudden, severe pain, and commonly end-organ symptoms which must be recognised. Acute aortic dissection can be challenging to diagnose in the emergency department because of the multitude of possible presentations and the need for selective testing with Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA). Clinicians often miss acute aortic dissection because it is not considered in the differential diagnosis, and the challenge lies in identifying acute aortic dissection in a sea of complaints of chest, back and abdominal pain. There are several ways to improve diagnosis, including awareness campaigns, better education about patients in which to consider acute aortic dissection, and improved detection strategies including which patients should receive CTA. Clinical decision tools and biomarkers could help, but further research is required and is a research focus in emergency medicine. Once diagnosed, blood pressure control, analgesia and urgent surgery or transfer to enable this to occur with minimal delay is required."

    "title": "Hypertensive Emergency Team-Based Learning.",
    "abstract": "The target audiences for this team-based learning (TBL) activity are resident physicians and medical students. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly half of the adults in the United States have hypertension,1 which is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and premature death.2 In extreme cases, patients may present in hypertensive emergencies, defined as an acute, marked elevation of systolic blood pressure >180mmHg or diastolic blood pressure >120mmHg with evidence of organ dysfunction.3,4 Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with symptoms of hypertensive emergencies must be promptly diagnosed and treated to prevent further morbidity and mortality. This TBL utilizes four clinical cases to educate resident physicians and medical students not only on the recognition of hypertensive emergencies, but also on the workup, management, and disposition of patients who present to the ED with hypertension. By the end of this TBL session, learners should be able to: 1) define features of asymptomatic hypertension versus hypertensive emergency, 2) discuss which patients with elevated blood pressure may require further diagnostic workup and intervention, 3) identify a differential diagnosis for patients presenting with elevated blood pressures, 4) recognize the features of different types of end-organ damage, 5) review an algorithm for the pharmacologic management of hypertensive emergencies, 6) indicate dosing and routes of various anti-hypertensive medications, 7) choose the appropriate treatment for a patient who is hypertensive and presenting with flash pulmonary edema, 8) identify an aortic dissection on computed tomography (CT), 9) choose the appropriate treatment for a patient who is hypertensive and presenting with an aortic dissection, 10) identify intracranial hemorrhage on CT, 11) choose the appropriate treatment for a patient who is hypertensive and presenting with an intracranial hemorrhage, and 12) describe the intervention for warfarin reversal. This is a classic TBL that includes an individual readiness assessment test (iRAT), a multiple-choice group readiness assessment test (gRAT), and a group application exercise (GAE). Learners and instructors were given the opportunity to provide verbal feedback after completion of the TBL. Learners included senior medical students and first-, second-, and third-year emergency-medicine residents. Learners were specifically asked if they felt the cases were educational, relevant, and useful to their training. Six resident physicians and three medical students volunteered their verbal feedback, and agreed when they were specifically asked if the cases were educational, relevant, and useful to their training. The same learners also agreed when asked if they felt the TBL was a more enjoyable activity than a direct lecture to refresh their knowledge and skills. One instructor observed that interns and medical students were generally able to reach a correct diagnosis; however, they seemed to struggle more with describing appropriate pharmacologic interventions when compared to more senior learners. Hypertension is a common complaint and incidental finding in patients presenting to the ED. Given its non-specific value, it can be a difficult topic for the novice healthcare provider to master. The differential diagnosis for a patient presenting with hypertension is vast, ranging from benign to emergent, and can sometimes necessitate minimal to substantial workups. Thus, this TBL is a useful, relevant, and effective exercise for residents-in-training to review and understand the management of hypertension.

Among them, mycotic pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm, which occurs in relatively central areas, has rarely been reported. We report an extremely rare case of a late complication with a mycotic pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm, presumably due to infective endocarditis, in a 68-year-old woman 4 months after total arch replacement. A 68-year-old woman was referred to our department for 2 weeks with fever of unknown origin. She had a history of emergency total arch replacement for an acute type A aortic dissection 4 months earlier and chronic rheumatoid arthritis on monthly subcutaneous tocilizumab treatment for several years. Blood culture was positive for Enterococcus faecalis. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 58%, severe mitral regurgitation with a 15-mm diameter vegetation on the anterior mitral leaflet, and severe aortic insufficiency with string-like structures. Contrast computed tomography showed a focal saccular outpouching from the right pulmonary artery. On 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography, focal uptake of FDGs was observed along the same lesion of the pulmonary artery and ascending-arch graft. The patient eventually recovered after the surgical intervention of mitral and aortic valve replacement, re-total arch replacement, pulmonary artery repair, application of omental flap, and antibiotics without any evidence of re-infection after 1 year. We report a successful surgical repair of mycotic pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm 4 months after total arch replacement for acute type A aortic dissection.

    "abstract": "The frozen elephant trunk (FET) technique as a hybrid combining surgical and endovascular repair is an emerging concept to treat complex aortic dissection. Early experience showed technical feasibility and promising clinical outcomes. However, unsuspected complications still arise. A 25-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a 2-day history of chest pain. After exclusion of acute coronary syndrome, a computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed Type A (DeBakey Type I) aortic dissection. The patient underwent median stenotomy for complete replacement of the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, and FET. Early after rewarming, the patient became unstable due to severe left ventricular dysfunction. Soon veno-arterial extracorporal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) was required for circulatory support. The cause of deterioration remained unclear until repeated CTA showed acute obstruction of the FET. Invasive exploration confirmed a trans-FET gradient of 100 mmHg, successfully managed by repeated balloon inflation with resolution of both obstruction and gradient. The patient recovered completely without any sequela. While the mechanism of acute obstruction after FET remains subject to speculation, the rescue intervention of ballooning the obliteration on VA-ECMO was life-saving. Intraoperative ultrasound and videoscopic inspection may be instrumental before chest closure to avoid such critical events."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a critical cardiovascular emergency that requires prompt surgical intervention for preserving life, particularly in patients with critical preoperative status. This retrospective study aimed to investigate the clinical features, early and late outcomes, and prognostic factors in patients undergoing aortic repair surgery for ATAAD complicated with preoperative shock. Between April 2007 and July 2020, 694 consecutive patients underwent emergency ATAAD repair at our institution, including 162 (23.3%) presenting with preoperative shock (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg), who were classified into the survivor (n = 125) and non-survivor (n = 37) groups according to whether they survived to hospital discharge. The clinical demographics, surgical information, and postoperative complications were compared. Five-year survival and freedom from reoperation rates of survivors were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier actuarial method. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality. The in-hospital surgical mortality rate in patients with ATAAD and shock was 22.8%. The non-survivor group showed higher rates of preoperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation, acute myocardial infarction, and cerebral infarction, and was associated with longer cardiopulmonary bypass time, higher rates of total arch replacement and intraoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation implementation. The non-survivor group had higher blood transfusion volumes and rates of malperfusion-related complications. Multivariate analysis revealed that preoperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time, and total arch replacement were risk factors for in-hospital mortality. For patients who survived to discharge, the 5-year cumulative survival and freedom from aortic reoperation rates were 75.6% (95% confidence interval, 67.6%-83.6%) and 82.6% (95% confidence interval, 74.2%-91.1%), respectively. Preoperative shock in ATAAD is associated with a high risk of in-hospital mortality, particularly in patients who undergo cardiopulmonary resuscitation and complex aortic repair procedures with extended cardiopulmonary bypass. However, late outcomes are acceptable for patients who were stabilized through surgical treatment and survived to discharge."

    "abstract": "Background and objectives: The relationship between cerebral perfusion and new postoperative ischemic stroke in obese patients is not well defined. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between selective bilateral anterograde cerebral perfusion and new postoperative ischemic stroke in obese patients with emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection. Materials and methods: A total of 292 patients with emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection were included in this study. Patients with hemorrhagic stroke or ischemic stroke with severe neurological dysfunction at admission that were not candidates for surgery; patients who died in the first 48 h after intensive care admission and patients with incomplete medical records were excluded. Results: The mean age was 59.42 ± 10.68 years and the mean Euroscore was 9.12 ± 1.63. Obesity was present in 76.4%, the incidence of new postoperative ischemic stroke was 27.5%, and the postoperative mortality rate was 26.7%. The mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 206.81 ± 75.48 min, the aortic cross-clamp time was 118.2 ± 46.42 min, and 90% of cases required cerebral perfusion. The mean cerebral perfusion time was 30.8 ± 24.41 min. Obese patients had a higher frequency of in-hospital death (p = 0.009), smoking (p = 0.036), hypertension (p = 0.023), left common carotid artery dissection (p < 0.001), right common carotid artery dissection (p = 0.029), femoral artery cannulation (p = 0.026), aortic root replacement (p = 0.009), aortic valve replacement (p = 0.005) and early reintervention for bleeding (p = 0.004). Using logistic regression, selective bilateral anterograde cerebral perfusion over 40 min in obese patients was independently associated with new postoperative ischemic stroke (OR = 2.35; 95%CI = 1.36-4.86; p = 0.021). Conclusions: A patient-tailored strategy for cerebral perfusion should be considered in obese patients, considering the high atheromatous burden of the supra-aortic vessels in these patients and the potential risk of atheromatous embolization associated with this technique."

    "abstract": "Objectives: Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a life-threatening cardiovascular emergency, of which the long-term impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and male-female-specific insights remain inadequately clarified. Methods: Consecutive adult ATAAD patients who underwent surgery were retrospectively included between 2007 and 2017 in four referral centers in the Netherlands, and baseline data were collected. The 36-Item Short-Form (SF-36) Health Survey was sent to all survivors between 2019 and 2021 and compared to validated SF-36 scores of the Dutch general population stratified by age group and sex. Results: In total, 324/555 surviving patients returned the SF-36 questionnaire (response rate 58%), of which 40.0% were female; the median follow-up was 6.5 years (range: 1.7-13.9, IQR: 4.0-9.4) after surgery for ATAAD. In comparison to the general population, ATAAD patients scored significantly lower on 6/8 SF-36 subdomains and higher on bodily pain. Differences in HRQoL domains compared to the sex-matched data were largely comparable between sexes, apart from bodily pain. In the age-matched subgroups impaired HRQoL was most pronounced in younger patients aged 41-60 (5/8 impaired domains). Female ATAAD patients scored significantly worse on 5/8 SF-36 subdomains and the physical component summary (PCS) scores than male patients. Age at ATAAD, female sex, hypertension, COPD, and prior thoracic aortic aneurysm were associated with worse PCS scores. Conclusions: Long-term HRQoL was impaired in both male and female ATAAD patients when compared to the general population. Further studies on the nature of this impairment and on interventions to improve HRQoL after ATAAD are clearly warranted, with special attention to females and younger patients."

    "abstract": "Type A aortic dissection (AD) and intramural hematoma (IMH) are critical medical conditions. Emergency surgery is typically performed under cardiopulmonary bypass immediately after diagnosis, which involves lowering the body temperature to induce total circulatory arrest. Selection of the arterial cannulation site is a critical consideration in cardiac surgery and becomes more challenging in patients with AD. This study explored the strengths and weaknesses of different cannulation methods by comparing each cannulation strategy and analyzing the reasons for patients' outcomes, especially mortality and cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs). This retrospective study reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent surgery for type A AD or IMH between 2008 and 2023, using the moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest approach at a single center. Among the 146 patients reviewed, 32 underwent antegrade cannulation via axillary, innominate artery, aortic, or transapical cannulation, while 114 underwent retrograde cannulation via the femoral artery. The analysis of surgical outcomes revealed a significant difference in the total surgical time, with 356 minutes for antegrade and 443 minutes for retrograde cannulation (p<0.001). The mean length of stay in the intensive care unit was significantly longer in the retrograde group (5±16 days) than in the antegrade group (3±5 days, p=0.013). Nevertheless, no significant difference was found between the groups in the 30-day mortality or postoperative CVA rates (p=0.2 and p=0.7, respectively). Surgeons should consider an appropriate cannulation strategy for each patient instead of adhering strictly to a specific approach in AD surgery."

    "abstract": "Non-A non-B aortic dissection (AD) is a rare and life-threatening medical emergency, and it has been controversial whether it should be managed as type B aortic dissection (TBAD). The study aims to compare in-hospital and follow-up outcomes between patients with non-A non-B AD and those with TBAD treated by endovascular based treatment (EBT). From January 2017 to December 2021, 96 consecutive patients with non-A non-B AD met the inclusion criteria and underwent EBT. Patients with TBAD were matched to patients with non-A non-B AD at a 1:1 ratio using propensity score matching analysis to correct for baseline confounding factors. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Aortic-related events were defined as dissection-related death, aortic rupture, retrograde type A aortic dissection, reintervention, and type Ia endoleak. Patients with non-A non-B AD required more TEVAR-related adjunctive procedures compared to TBAD patients during EBT and they required a longer ICU length of stay (36.0 vs 24.0 hours, P < .05) as well as a longer hospitalization (8.0 vs 7.0 days, P < .05) after EBT. There was no statistical difference in overall survival after EBT for patients with TBAD and non-A non-B AD. However, compared to patients with TBAD, non-A non-B AD patients had a higher rate of reintervention and experienced more aortic-related late events during follow-up. Patients with non-A non-B acute AD who are treated with EBT do not have higher in-hospital or follow-up mortality rates compared to patients with type B AD. However, there is an increased risk of reintervention and aortic-related late events after the intervention during follow-up."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a life-threatening emergency that is associated with a high morbidity and mortality rate. One of the complications is end-organ ischemia, a known predictor of mortality. The primary aims of this meta-analysis were to summarize the findings of observational studies investigating the utility of the Penn classification system and to analyze the incidence rates and mortality patterns within each class. The electronic databases PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase were searched through to April 2023. These were filtered by multiple reviewers to give 10 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The extracted data included patient characteristics, and primary outcomes were the incidence rates of different Penn classes, along with the corresponding mortality for each class. Out of 1,512 studies identified during the initial search, 10 studies, including 4,494 patients, met the inclusion criteria. The pooled incidence of Penn A was highest at 0.55 (95% CI 0.52, 0.58), followed by Penn B at 0.21 (95% CI 0.17, 0.25), and finally Penn C at 0.14 (95% CI 0.11, 0.17). Patients with Penn BC were found to be at the highest risk of death, as their early mortality rates were 0.36 (95% CI 0.31, 0.41). Within those populations, the subtype with the highest individual mortality was Penn C at 0.21 (95% CI 0.15, 0.27), followed by Penn B at 0.19 (95% CI 0.15, 0.23) and Penn A at 0.07 (95% CI 0.05, 0.10). Among patients presenting with ATAAD, class A was most frequently observed, followed by classes B, C, and BC. These findings indicate an incremental increase in mortality rates with the progression of Penn classification."

    "abstract": "During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, medical resources have often been limited to emergency surgeries. This study aimed to evaluate our experience with delayed surgery for acute type A aortic dissections (ATAADs). A retrospective study was conducted on 33 patients who underwent surgery for ATAADs between January 2020 and December 2021. The patients were divided into two groups: patients treated within 12 h of arrival (E group; N = 21) and those treated > 12 h after arrival (D group; N = 12) with strict antihypertensive therapy until surgery. The plasma fibrinogen levels on arrival were lower in the D group than in the E group (174.3 ± 109.1 vs 293.4 ± 165.4, p = 0.038). The time to surgery from symptom onset was longer in the D group than in the E group (4 ± 1 h vs. 86 ± 108 h, p < 0.001). There was one case (3%) of mortality and seven cases (21%) of cerebral infarctions in the E group. There was no significant difference in the intraoperative data and quantity of blood transfused between the two groups. Thus, delayed surgery for ATAAD with appropriate preoperative management may be an alternative surgical strategy in the COVID-19 era."

    "abstract": "It is rare for two critical diseases, namely a giant abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and acute type A aortic dissection (TAAD), to be detected simultaneously, and in such instances, management is extremely difficult. A 64-year-old man who presented to our hospital with a chief complaint of sudden back pain and vomiting was diagnosed with acute retrograde TAAD and a giant AAA with chronic contained rupture (CCR) via computed tomography. We initially managed the acute TAAD conservatively and subsequently performed laparotomy for the AAA 3 months later. During open surgery, we performed vascular reconstruction using a tailor-made tapering graft. Emergency surgery is recommended for AAA with CCR or retrograde TAAD with a patent false lumen, and the prognosis of conservative treatments for these cases is currently unknown. However, concurrent surgery for this condition is extremely invasive. Fortunately, the patient in this case survived the acute phase, and laparotomy for the AAA could be safely performed during the chronic phase of the TAAD. We successfully treated a giant AAA with CCR by selecting the appropriate surgical timing and method. In cases of combined CCR of a giant AAA and retrograde TAAD, conservative management may be attempted to convert the acute dissection to a chronic one, thereby allowing elective repair of the AAA."

Here we report two cases of LVFWR with different clinical presentation and notable outcome. A 53-year-old male presenting emergently with signs of myocardial infarction received immediate coronary angiography and thoracic CT-scan showing occlusion of the first marginal coronary branch without possibility of revascularization and minimal pericardial extravasation. Under ICU surveillance, LVFWR occurred 24 h later and was treated by pericardiocentesis and ECMO support followed by immediate uncomplicated surgical repair. Postoperative therapy-refractory vasoplegia and electromechanical dissociation caused fulminant deterioration and the early death of the patient. The second case is a 76-year old male brought to the emergency room after sudden syncope, clinical sings of pericardial tamponade and suspicion of a type A acute aortic dissection. Immediate CT-angiography excluded aortic dissection and revealed massive pericardial effusion and a hypoperfused myocardial area on the territory of the first marginal branch. Immediate sternotomy under mechanical resuscitation enabled removal of the massive intrapericardial clot and revealed LVFWR. After an uncomplicated surgical repair, an uneventful postoperative course, the patient was discharged with sinus rhythm and good biventricular function. One year after the operation, he is living at home, symptom free. Whereas the younger patient, who was clinically stable at hospital admission received delayed surgery and did not survive treatment, the older patient, clinically unstable at presentation, went into immediate surgery and had a flawless postoperative course. Thus, early surgical repair of LVFWR leads to best outcome and treating LVFWR as a high emergency regardless of the symptoms improve survival."

    "title": "Effective Apixaban removal using hemoadsorption during emergent open-heart surgery: a case report and narrative literature review.",
    "abstract": "The management of hemostasis in patients medicated with apixaban (Eliquis) undergoing emergency cardiac surgery is exceedingly difficult. The body's natural elimination pathways for apixaban prove ineffective in emergency situations, and the impact of hemodialysis is limited. The application of Cytosorb® may attenuate the concentration of apixaban, thereby facilitating the stabilization of these patients. An 84-year-old man treated with apixaban, underwent emergency ascending aorta replacement surgery due to an acute type A aortic dissection. To address the challenges induced by apixaban, we integrated Cytosorb® cartridge into the Cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. There was a 63.7% decrease in perioperative apixaban-specific anti-factor Xa activity. The patient's postoperative course was favourable. Hemoadsorption with Cytosorb® may offers a safe and feasible approach for reducing apixaban concentration in emergency cardiac surgery, thereby mitigating the risk of hemorrhagic complications."

    "title": "A visceral organ function-focused therapeutic strategy using a 6-hour time window for patients with acute type a aortic dissection complicated by mesenteric malperfusion.",
    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) complicated by mesenteric malperfusion is a critical and complicated condition. The optimal treatment strategy remains controversial, debate exists as to whether aortic dissection or mesenteric malperfusion should be addressed first, and the exact time window for mesenteric ischemia intervention is still unclear. To solve this problem, we developed a new concept based on the pathophysiological mechanism of mesenteric ischemia, using a 6-hour time window to divide newly admitted patients by the time from onset to admission, applying different treatment protocols to improve the clinical outcomes of patients with ATAAD complicated by mesenteric malperfusion. This was a retrospective study that covered a five-year period. From July 2018 to December 2020(phase I), all patients underwent emergency open surgery. From January 2021 to June 2023(phase II), patients with an onset within 6 h all underwent open surgical repair, followed by immediately postoperative examination if the malperfusion is suspected, while the restoration of mesenteric perfusion and visceral organ function was performed first, followed by open repair, in patients with an onset beyond 6 h. There were no significant differences in baseline and surgical data. In phase I, eleven patients with mesenteric malperfusion underwent open surgery, while in phase II, our novel strategy was applied, with sixteen patients with an onset greater than 6 h and eleven patients with an onset less than 6 h. During the waiting period, none died of aortic rupture, but four patients died of organ failure, twelve patients had organ function improvement and underwent surgery successfully survived. The overall mortality rate decreased with the use of this novel strategy (54.55% vs. 18.52%, p = 0.047). Furthermore, the surgical mortality rate between the two periods showed even stronger statistical significance (54.55% vs. 4.35%, p = 0.022). Moreover, the proportions of patients with sepsis and multiorgan failure also showed differences. Our novel strategy for patients with ATAAD complicated by mesenteric malperfusion not only improves the surgical success rate but also reduces the overall mortality rate."

    "abstract": "The incidence of type A aortic dissection (TAAD) has increased in several countries in recent decades, but epidemiological data for Switzerland are lacking. Furthermore, there are conflicting data regarding a gender-disparity with higher type A aortic dissection mortality in women. This study analysed sex-specific hospital incidence and in-hospital mortality rates of TAAD in Switzerland. This study is a secondary data analysis of case-related hospital discharge data from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office for 2009-2018. Cases that were hospitalised and surgically treated for type A aortic dissection were included in this analysis. Standardised incidence rates were calculated using the European standard population in 2013. All-cause in-hospital mortality rates were calculated as raw values and standardised for age, sex, and the van Walraven comorbidity score. A total of 2117 participants were included in this study, of whom 67.1% were male. The age-standardised cumulative hospital incidence for type A aortic dissection treatment was 3.5 per 100,000 (95% CI: 3.3-3.7) for men and 1.7 (1.6-1.8) per 100,000 for women (p <0.001). The incidence rates increased in both sexes during the observed decade. The adjusted mortality rates for treatment of TAAD decreased from 27.6% (26.7-28.5%) in 2009 to 18.5% (17.9-19.1%) in 2018 in women, and they decreased from 19.0% (18.4-19.6%) to 12.3% (11.9-12.7%) in the same period in men. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that female sex was significantly associated with higher mortality, with an odds ratio of 1.39 (1.07-1.79) (p = 0.012). Hospital incidence rates for the treatment of type A aortic dissection increased in both sexes over the observed decade. The mortality rate was significantly higher in women than it was in men, but it decreased in both sexes. TAAD remains a cardiovascular emergency with a high mortality rate even after emergency surgery."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) is a rare but often lethal condition if not properly and urgently treated. Most often, patients arrive with acute hemodynamic instability and ripping chest agony. The patient's life depends critically on a correct diagnosis made as soon as possible. We describe a 60-year-old man who arrived at the emergency room with symptoms of a brain stroke, including poor consciousness, left-sided weakness, and speech disturbance associated with hemodynamic instability, and chest pain. Thoracic aortic arch dissection was observed on CT angiography (CTA). In addition, CTA revealed that the dissection extends proximally into the left common carotid artery, left subclavian artery, brachiocephalic trunk, and right common carotid artery and distally to the left common iliac artery, coupled with significant stenosis of the left common iliac artery. Proper management of blood pressure (BP) parameters is life-saving for the patient. Since our hospital did not offer cardiothoracic surgery services, the patient was transferred to a different institution, where he received medical care immediately from an expert team and had surgery."

    "abstract": "Acute Type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a life-threatening cardiovascular disease associated with high mortality rates, where surgical intervention remains the primary life-saving treatment. However, the mortality rate for ATAAD operations continues to be alarmingly high. To address this critical issue, our study aimed to assess the correlation between preoperative laboratory examination, clinical imaging data, and postoperative mortality in ATAAD patients. Additionally, we sought to establish a reliable prediction model for evaluating the risk of postoperative death. In this study, a total of 384 patients with acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) who were admitted to the emergency department for surgical treatment were included. Based on preoperative laboratory examination and clinical imaging data of ATAAD patients, logistic analysis was used to obtain independent risk factors for postoperative in-hospital death. The survival prediction model was based on cox regression analysis and displayed as a nomogram. Logistic analysis identified several independent risk factors for postoperative in-hospital death, including Marfan syndrome, previous cardiac surgery history, previous renal dialysis history, direct bilirubin, serum phosphorus, D-dimer, white blood cell, multiple aortic ruptures and age. A survival prediction model based on cox regression analysis was established and presented as a nomogram. The model exhibited good discrimination and significantly improved the prediction of death risk in ATAAD patients. In this study, we developed a novel survival prediction model for acute type A aortic dissection based on preoperative clinical features. The model demonstrated good discriminatory power and improved accuracy in predicting the risk of death in ATAAD patients undergoing open surgery."

    "abstract": "D-dimer is a marker of coagulation and fibrinolysis widely used in clinical practice for assessing thrombotic activity. While it is commonly ordered in the Emergency Department (ED) for suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE), elevated D-dimer levels can occur due to various other disorders. The aim of this study was to find out the causes of elevated D-dimer in patients presenting to a large ED in Saudi Arabia and evaluate the accuracy of D-dimer in diagnosing these conditions. Data was collected from an electronic hospital information system of patients who visited the ED from January 2016 to December 2022. Demographic information, comorbidities, D-dimer levels, and diagnoses were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS software. The different diagnoses associated with D-dimer levels were analyzed by plotting the median D-dimer levels for each diagnosis category and their interquartile ranges (IQR). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated and their area under the curve (AUC) values were demonstrated. The optimal cut-off points for specific diseases were determined based on the ROC analysis, along with their corresponding sensitivities and specificities. A total of 19,258 patients with D-dimer results were included in the study. The mean age of the participants was 50 years with a standard deviation of ± 18. Of the patients, 66% were female and 21.2% were aged 65 or above. Additionally, 21% had diabetes mellitus, 20.4% were hypertensive, and 15.1% had been diagnosed with dyslipidemia. The median D-dimer levels varied across different diagnoses, with the highest level observed in aortic aneurysm 5.46 g/L. Pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were found in 729 patients (3.8%) of our study population and their median D-dimer levels 3.07 g/L (IQR: 1.35-7.05 g/L) and 3.36 g/L (IQR: 1.06-8.38 g/L) respectively. On the other hand, 1767 patients (9.2%) were diagnosed with respiratory infections and 936 patients (4.9%) were diagnosed with shortness of breath (not specified) with median D-dimer levels of 0.76 g/L (IQR: 0.40-1.47 g/L) and 0.51 g/L (IQR: 0.29-1.06 g/L), respectively. D-dimer levels showed superior or excellent discrimination for PE (AUC = 0.844), leukemia (AUC = 0.848), and aortic aneurysm (AUC = 0.963). DVT and aortic dissection demonstrated acceptable discrimination, with AUC values of 0.795 and 0.737, respectively. D-dimer levels in respiratory infections and shortness of breath (not specified) exhibited poor to discriminatory performance. This is the first paper to identify multiple causes of elevated D-dimer levels in Saudi Arabia population within the ED and it clearly highlights their accurate and diagnostic values. These findings draw attention to the importance of considering the specific clinical context and utilizing additional diagnostic tools when evaluating patients with elevated D-dimer levels."

    "abstract": "The extent of surgery and the role of the frozen elephant trunk (FET) for surgical repair of acute aortic dissection type I are still subjects of debate. The aim of the study is to evaluate the short- and long-term results of acute surgical repair of aortic dissection type I using the FET compared to standard proximal aortic repair. Between October 2009 and December 2016, 172 patients underwent emergent surgery for acute type I aortic dissection at our center. Of these, n = 72 received a FET procedure, while the other 100 patients received a conventional proximal aortic repair. Results were compared between the two surgery groups. The primary endpoints included 30-day rates of mortality and neurologic deficit and follow-up rates of mortality and aortic-related reintervention. Demographic data were comparable between the groups, except for a higher proportion of men in the FET group (76.4% vs. 60.0%, p = 0.03). The median age was 62 years [IQR (20), p = 0.17], and the median log EuroSCORE was 38.6% [IQR (31.4), p = 0.21]. The mean follow-up time was 68.3 ± 33.8 months. Neither early (FET group 15.3% vs. proximal group 23.0%, p = 0.25) nor late (FET group 26.2% vs. proximal group 23.0%, p = 0.69) mortality showed significant differences between the groups. There were fewer strokes in the FET patients (FET group 2.8% vs. proximal group 11.0%, p = 0.04), and the rates of spinal cord injury were similar between the groups (FET group 4.2% vs. proximal group 2.0%, p = 0.41). Aortic-related reintervention rates did not differ between the groups (FET group 12.1% vs. proximal group 9.8%, p = 0.77). Emergent FET repair for acute aortic dissection type I is safe and feasible when performed by experienced surgeons. The benefits of the FET procedure in the long term remain unclear. Prolonged follow-up data are needed."

    "abstract": "Repair of aortic arch pathologies such as degenerative aneurysms and dissections still represents a significant challenge for vascular and cardiac surgeons. We focused on the design, evolution, implementation, and prospects of endovascular dual branch technology for treatment of pathologies in the aortic arch. The literature search was conducted in a non-systematic fashion through the PubMed and Scopus databases; articles deemed relevant to the scope of the work and fully published in English language from January 12,000 until December 2023 were considered for inclusion. Two companies so far have developed and launched in market a dedicated arch dual branch platform: Terumo Aortic and Cook Medical. A common limitation to the available technology is represented by the fact that urgent cases (i.e. large or rapidly growing aneurysms, symptomatic patients) cannot be treated because the customization process generally takes between 6 and 8 weeks, and there is an inherent risk for aorta-related adverse events to happen during the waiting time. While the future holds much promise, several technical hurdles still exist and further developments (in device design, operators' skills, patients' selection, and outcomes assessment) are needed to establish the safety and effectiveness of treatment particularly over the long-run."

The clinical manifestations of these disorders can be varied and non-specific, ranging from acute presentations in the emergency department to chronic incidental findings in an outpatient setting. Given the non-specific nature of their clinical presentations, the reliance on non-invasive imaging for screening, definitive diagnosis, therapeutic strategy planning, and post-intervention surveillance has become paramount. Commonly used imaging modalities include ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and MR imaging. Among these modalities, computed tomography angiography (CTA) has emerged as a first-line imaging modality owing to its excellent anatomic detail, widespread availability, established imaging protocols, evidence-proven indications, and rapid acquisition time."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is common in patients undergoing open surgical repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs). Most often, dissection is chronic and is associated with progressive aortic dilatation. Because contemporary outcomes in chronic dissection are not clearly understood, we compared patient characteristics and outcomes after open TAAA repair between patients with chronic dissection and those with non-dissection aneurysm. We retrospectively analyzed data from 3470 open TAAA repairs performed in a single practice. Operations were for non-dissection aneurysm in 2351 (67.8%) and chronic dissection in 1119 (32.2%). Outcomes included operative mortality and adverse events, a composite variable comprising operative death and persistent (present at discharge) stroke, paraplegia, paraparesis, and renal failure necessitating dialysis. Logistic regression identified predictors of operative mortality and adverse events. Time-to-event analyses examined survival, death, repair failure, subsequent progressive repair, and survival free of failure or subsequent repair. Compared with patients with non-dissection aneurysm, those with chronic dissection were younger, had fewer atherosclerotic risk factors, and were more likely to have heritable thoracic aortic disease and undergo extent II repair. The operative mortality rate was 8.5% (n = 296) overall and was higher in non-dissection aneurysm patients (n = 217; 9.2%) than in chronic dissection patients (n = 79; 7.1%; P = .03). Adverse events were less frequent (P = .01) in patients with chronic dissection (n = 145; 13.0%), 22 (2.0%) of whom had persistent paraplegia. Chronic dissection was not predictive of operative mortality (P = .5) or adverse events (P = .6). Operative mortality and adverse events, respectively, were independently predicted by emergency repair (odds ratio [OR], 3.46 and 2.87), chronic kidney disease (OR, 1.74 and 1.81), extent II TAAA repair (OR, 1.44 and 1.73), increasing age (OR, 1.04/year and 1.04/year), and increasing aortic cross-clamp time (OR, 1.02/minutes and 1.02/minutes). Patients with chronic dissection had lower 10-year unadjusted mortality (42% vs 69%) but more frequent repair failure (5% vs 3%) and subsequent repair for progressive aortic disease (11% vs 5%) than patients with non-dissection aneurysm (P < .001); these differences were no longer statistically significant after adjustment. Outcomes of open TAAA repair vary by aortic disease type. Emergency repairs and atherosclerotic diseases most commonly occur in patients with non-dissection aneurysm and independently predict operative mortality. Repair of chronic dissection is associated with low rates of adverse events, including operative mortality and persistent paraplegia, along with reasonable late survival and good durability. However, patients with chronic dissection tend to more commonly undergo subsequent repair to treat progressive aortic disease, which emphasizes the need for robust long-term imaging surveillance protocols."

    "abstract": "The clinical characteristics and early outcomes of surgical repair in octogenarians with acute type A aortic dissection were compared with those in nonoctogenarians. All patients who underwent emergency surgical repair for acute type A aortic dissection in our institution between 2003 and 2022 were included in this study. The patients were divided into an octogenarian group and a nonoctogenarian group. The patients in the 2 groups were propensity score matched at a ratio of 1:1. Before matching, the baseline characteristics were compared between 2 groups. The major complication and 30-day mortality rates were compared in the matched population. A total of 495 patients were screened, and 471 were included in the analysis, with 48 in the octogenarian group and 423 in the nonoctogenarian group. Before matching, DeBakey type II dissection was significantly more prevalent in the octogenarians (42% vs 14% in the octogenarians and nonoctogenarians, respectively, P < 0.001). Additionally, intramural haematomas (39.6% vs 14.4%, P < 0.001) were more prevalent in the octogenarians. However, severe aortic regurgitation (4.2% vs 15.4%, P = 0.046) and root enlargement (0% vs 13.7%, P = 0.009) were less prevalent in the octogenarians. After matching (36 pairs), the incidence of postoperative delirium was higher in the octogenarians (56% vs 25%, P = 0.027). However, there were no significant differences in 30-day and in-hospital mortality rates, intensive care unit stay or major complications, including stroke, paraplegia, respiratory complications, mediastinitis and haemodialysis. The octogenarians with acute type A aortic dissection had higher incidences of DeBakey type II dissection and intramural haematomas and lower incidences of severe aortic regurgitation and aortic root enlargement than the nonoctogenarians. Being an octogenarian was not associated with an increased risk of early major complications or mortality after surgery for acute type A aortic dissection."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) still challenges physicians and warrants emergent surgical management. Two main methods to reduce cerebrovascular events in ATAAD surgeries are antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP) and retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the outcomes of ACP and RCP methods during the ATAAD surgery. In this study, we searched the databases until March 29th, 2023. Studies that reported the data for comparison of different types of brain perfusion protection during aortic surgery in patients with ATAAD were included. Twenty-six studies met the eligibility criteria. All studies had a low risk of bias as they were evaluated by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool. Eventually, we included 26 studies in the current meta-analysis, and a total of 13,039 patients were evaluated. The calculated risk ratio (RR) for permanent neurologic dysfunction (PND) in ACP and RCP comparison was RR =1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI): (0.84, 1.80) (P value =0.2662), and in unilateral ACP (uACP) and bilateral ACP (bACP) was RR =1.2786, 95% CI: (0.7931, 2.0615) (P value =0.3132). When comparing the ACP-RCP and uACP-bACP groups, significant differences were found between ACP-RCP the groups in terms of circulatory arrest time (P value =0.0017 and P value =0.1995, respectively), cardiopulmonary bypass time (P value =0.5312 and P value =0.7460, respectively), intensive care unit (ICU)-stay time (P value =0.2654 and P value =0.0099), crossclamp time (P value =0.6228 and P value =0.2625), and operative mortality (P value =0.9368 and P value =0.2398, respectively), and when comparing the u-ACP and b-ACP groups for transient neurologic deficit (TND), an RR of 1.32, 95% CI: (1.05, 1.67) (P value =0.0199). The results showed high heterogeneity and no publication bias. This study demonstrated that the ACP and RCP are both safe and acceptable techniques to use in emergent settings. The uACP technique is equivalent to bACP in terms of PND and mortality, however, uACP is preferred over bACP in terms of TND."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) is a life-threatening medical emergency with a high mortality rate if misdiagnosed; therefore, an urgent and precise diagnosis is crucial for prompt treatment. This article presents a rare case report of AD with an atypical clinical presentation that led to delayed diagnosis and a complicated clinical course. Herein, we aim to contribute to the existing literature by providing insights into the varied presentations of AD and offering valuable lessons for clinicians faced with similar diagnostic scenarios. A 64-year-old female with an extended history of hypertension and other comorbidities presented to the emergency department with a one-day duration of right-sided loin pain and fever. Her blood investigations demonstrated evidence of leukocytosis and high c-reactive protein (CRP) levels. She was preliminarily treated as a case of acute pyelonephritis since, initially, clinical and radiographic evidence did not yield an alternative diagnosis. Despite antibiotics, her condition deteriorated, and her urine output became less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour for six consecutive hours. Additionally, the obtained urine culture was negative on the third day of admission, which made the medical team repeat her history taking and clinical examination, revealing a previously overlooked weight loss. This red flag prompted the medical team to conduct thorough chest and abdominal imaging studies in search of any hidden malignancy, especially when her thyroid function test returned normal. Surprisingly, a contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan demonstrated an infarcted right kidney by thromboembolism that originated from the partially obstructive thrombus in the proximal abdominal aorta, which was later confirmed to be a type B AD by a CT angiogram. A multidisciplinary team guided her treatment, which included carefully controlling her blood pressure, using anticoagulants, and closely monitoring the patient. The take-home messages of this case report underscore the critical importance of recognizing atypical clinical presentations of AD, overcoming diagnostic challenges through comprehensive approaches, tailoring treatments to individual patient needs, and advocating for a multidisciplinary and patient-centered approach to enhance overall clinical outcomes."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic intramural hematoma (ATAIMH) is a variant of acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD), exhibiting an increased risk of hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade. It can be life-threatening without emergency treatment. However, comprehensive studies of the clinical features and surgical outcomes of preoperative hemopericardium in patients with ATAIMH remain scarce. This retrospective study aims to investigate the clinical features and early and late outcomes of patients who underwent aortic repair surgery for ATAIMH complicated with preoperative hemopericardium. We investigated 132 consecutive patients who underwent emergency ATAIMH repair at this institution between February 2007 and August 2020. These patients were dichotomized into the hemopericardium (n = 58; 43.9%) and non-hemopericardium groups (n = 74; 56.1%). We compared the clinical demographics, surgical information, postoperative complications, 5-year cumulative survival rates, and freedom from reoperation rates. Furthermore, multivariable logistic regression analysis was utilized to identify independent risk factors for patients who underwent re-exploration for bleeding. In the hemopericardium group, 36.2% of patients presented with cardiac tamponade before surgery. Moreover, the hemopericardium group showed higher rates of preoperative shock and endotracheal intubation and was associated with an elevated incidence of intractable perioperative bleeding, necessitating delayed sternal closure for hemostasis. The hemopericardium group exhibited higher blood transfusion volumes and rates of re-exploration for bleeding following surgery. However, the 5-year survival (59.5% vs. 75.0%; P = 0.077) and freedom from reoperation rates (93.3% vs. 85.5%; P = 0.416) were comparable between both groups. Multivariable analysis revealed that hemopericardium, cardiopulmonary bypass time, and delayed sternal closure were the risk factors for bleeding re-exploration. The presence of hemopericardium in patients with ATAIMH is associated with an elevated incidence of cardiac tamponade and unstable preoperative hemodynamics, which could lead to perioperative bleeding tendencies and high complication rates. However, patients of ATAIMH complicated with hemopericardium undergoing aggressive surgical intervention exhibited long-term surgical outcomes comparable to those without hemopericardium."

    "abstract": "Aortic rupture is a rare and catastrophic emergency. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are the primary determinants of mortality. During follow-up, the majority of patients who have been effectively treated die from hypovolemic shock and multiorgan failure. This article describes the clinical and procedural details of sixteen patients with ruptured aortic aneurysms treated endovascularly. In addition, it discusses the main factors contributing to the mortality of these patients. Patients who underwent endovascular treatment for acute aortic rupture at our center from October 2016 to March 2023 were included in this retrospective study. A total of 16 patients underwent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) or thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) for acute aortic rupture. The patients' mean age was 73.06 years (range: 52-92), and 15 of them were male. The ruptures occurred in the abdominal aortic aneurysm in ten patients, in thoracic aortic aneurysm in three patients, in the isolated iliac artery aneurysm in two patients, and there was one case of non-aneurysmal aortic rupture. In our series, patients who presented with an impending, self-limited rupture and stable hemodynamic status had good prognostic outcomes. However, eight patients died due to multiorgan failure, hemorrhagic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, renal failure, or abdominal compartment syndrome. These patients generally had poor admission vital signs and low hemoglobin values. The most critical determinants for the success of the procedure are promptly stopping the bleeding, avoiding general anesthesia, and opting for blood product replacement instead of fluid replacement. Each patient with ruptured aortic aneurysm should be managed according to the patient's hemodynamics at presentation, the size of the aneurysm, the suitability for percutaneous procedure, logistical factors, and the operator-center's experience."

    "abstract": "Peripheral platelet-white blood cell ratio (PWR) integrating systemic inflammatory and coagulopathic pathways is a key residual inflammatory measurement in the management of acute DeBakey type I aortic dissection (AAD); however, trajectories of PWR in AAD is poorly defined. Two AAD cohorts were included in two cardiovascular centers (2020-2022) if patients underwent emergency total arch replacement with frozen elephant trunk implantation. PWR data were collected over time at baseline and five consecutive days after surgery. Trajectory patterns of PWR were determined using the latent class mixed modelling (LCMM). Cox regression was used to determine independent risk factors. By adding PWR Trajectory, a user-friendly nomogram was developed for predicting mortality after surgery. Two hundred forty-six patients with AAD were included with a median follow-up of 26 (IRQ 20-37) months. Three trajectories of PWR were identified [cluster α 45(18.3%), β105 (42.7%), and γ 96 (39.0%)]. Cluster γ was associated with higher risk of mortality at follow-up (crude HR, 3.763; 95% CI: 1.126-12.574; P =0.031) than cluster α. By the addition of PWR trajectories, an inflammatory nomogram, composed of age, hemoglobin, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and cardiopulmonary time was developed and internally validated, with adequate discrimination [the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve 0.765, 95% CI: 0.660-0.869)], calibration, and clinical utility. Based on PWR trajectories, three distinct clusters were identified with short-term outcomes, and longitudinal residual inflammatory shed some light to individualize treatment strategies for AAD."

    "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor pathway inhibitors (VPIs) pose a concern for aortic aneurysm (AA) and aortic dissection (AD), signaling potential vascular disease development. To investigate VPI-associated AA and AD. This case-control study with a nested design used full population data from a national claims database in Taiwan between 2011 and 2019. Eligible participants were aged 20 years or older with kidney, hepatic, gastrointestinal, or pancreatic cancer diagnosed between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2019. The first cancer diagnosis date was defined as the cohort entry date. Cases were patients who received a diagnosis of AA or AD in hospitalizations or emergency visits between the cohort entry date and December 31, 2019. Controls were matched by ratio (up to 1:5) based on age, sex, cancer type, cohort entry date, and the index date (ie, the first AA or AD event date). Data analysis was performed between January 2022 and December 2023. Use of the oral VPIs sorafenib, sunitinib, and pazopanib between cohort entry date and index date. In the primary analysis, AA and AD were evaluated compositely, while in the secondary analyses, they were evaluated separately. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were calculated using conditional logistic regression to assess the association with VPI use (sorafenib, sunitinib, and pazopanib) considering various VPI exposure windows and cumulative use. A total of 1461 cases were included (mean [SD] age, 73.0 [12.3] years; 1118 male patients [76.5%]), matched to 7198 controls. AA or AD risk increased with a VPI exposure of 100 days or less before the index date (aOR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.40-3.15), mainly from VPI-associated AD (aOR, 3.09; 95% CI, 1.77-5.39). Longer VPI duration (68 days or more: aOR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.66-4.19) and higher cumulative dose (61 or more defined daily doses: aOR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.66-4.23) increased the risk. The use of the 3 study VPIs (sorafenib, sunitinib, and pazopanib) was associated with an increased risk of AA and AD in patients with cancer, essentially all of the risk from VPI-associated AD. Future studies are needed to determine the risk factors of VPI-associated AA and AD, as well as to establish a class effect."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to report on mid-term outcomes after endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) in patients with Marfan (MFS) or Loeys-Dietz (LDS) syndrome. We analysed data from 2 European centres of patients with MFS and LDS undergoing EVAR. Patients were analysed based on (i) timing of the procedure (planned versus emergency procedure) and (ii) the nature of the landing zone (safe versus non-safe). The primary end-point was freedom from reintervention. Secondary end-points were freedom from stroke, bleeding and death. A population of 419 patients with MFS (n = 352) or LDS (n = 67) was analysed for the purpose of this study. Thirty-nine patients (9%) underwent EVAR. Indications for thoracic endovascular aortic repair or EVAR were aortic dissection in 13 (33%) patients, aortic aneurysm in 22 (57%) patients and others (intercostal patch aneurysm, penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer, pseudoaneurysm, kinking of frozen elephant trunk (FET)) in 4 (10%) patients. Thoracic endovascular repair was performed in 34 patients, and abdominal endovascular aortic repair was performed in 5 patients. Mean age at 1st thoracic endovascular aortic repair/EVAR was 48.5 ± 15.4 years. Mean follow-up after 1st thoracic endovascular aortic repair/EVAR was 5.9 ± 4.4 years. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of reinterventions between patients with non-safe landing zone and the patients with safe proximal landing zone (P = 0.609). Furthermore, there was no increased probability for reintervention after planned endovascular intervention compared to emergency procedures (P = 0.916). Mean time to reintervention, either open surgical or endovascular, after planned endovascular intervention was in median 3.9 years (95% confidence interval 2.0-5.9 years) and 2.0 years (95% confidence interval -1.1 to 5.1 years) (P = 0.23) after emergency procedures. EVAR in patients with MFS and LDS and a safe landing zone is feasible and safe. Endovascular treatment is a viable option when employed by a multi-disciplinary aortic team even if the landing zone is in native tissue."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection type A (AADA) is a life-threatening medical emergency. Emergent surgical repair is the gold standard but mortality remains high. Mortality is even higher in patients who arrive at the hospital in poor condition, especially after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). This study was designed to analyse the outcome of patients who underwent surgery for AADA and who require preoperative CPR. Between 2000 and 2023, 810 patients underwent emergent surgery for AADA at our centre. Of these, 63 had preoperative CPR. We performed a retrospective analysis with follow-up. Mean age was 64 ± 13 years and 37 (59%) patients were male. Further, 50 (79%) patients had preoperative intubation, and 54 (86%) had pericardial effusion. Twenty-four (38%) patients had out-of-hospital CPR, 19 (30%) required CPR in hospital and 20 (32%) needed CPR in the operating room. Successful CPR with return of spontaneous circulation was achieved in 41 (65%) patients, and 22 (35%) underwent emergent surgery under ongoing CPR. The median time of CPR was 10 (interquartile range 12) min, and the median time from onset of symptoms to start of the operation was 5.5 (interquartile range 4.8) h. The majority of patients underwent ascending aortic replacement with hemiarch repair (n = 37, 59%). Further, 26 (41%) patients underwent full root replacement. Another 15 (24%) patients underwent total arch repair with or without (frozen) elephant trunk repair. Postoperative stroke was present in 8 (13%) patients. The 30-day mortality was 29 (46%). The 30-day mortality of patients with preoperative intubation was not significantly higher (n = 15/28, 54%, P = 0.446). The 1-, 5- and 10-year survival rates of the entire group were 42, 39 and 36%. Early mortality for patients undergoing surgery for AADA with preoperative CPR is extremely high (almost 50%). However, this means that also ∼50% of patients benefit from surgery despite poor preoperative prognosis. Patients with preoperative intubation after CPR and unknown neurological condition should also undergo surgery. Patients who survive the initial operation for AADA have acceptable long-term survival. Emergent surgery should be offered for all patients with AADA regardless of the preoperative condition, even after CPR."

    "abstract": "Epidemiological data on ruptured aortic aneurysms from large-scale studies are scarce. The aims of this study were to: clarify the clinical course of ruptured aortic aneurysms; identify aneurysm site-specific therapies and outcomes; and determine the clinical course of patients receiving conservative therapy. Using the Tokyo Acute Aortic Super Network database, we retrospectively analyzed 544 patients (mean [±SD] age 78±10 years; 70% male) with ruptured non-dissecting aortic aneurysms (AAs) after excluding those with impending rupture. Patient characteristics, status on admission, therapeutic strategy, and outcomes were evaluated. Shock or pulselessness on admission were observed in 45% of all patients. Conservative therapy, endovascular therapy (EVT), and open surgery (OS) accounted for 32%, 23%, and 42% of cases, respectively, with corresponding mortality rates of 93%, 30%, and 29%. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 50%. The prevalence of pulselessness was highest (48%) in the ruptured ascending AA group, and in-hospital mortality was the highest (70%) in the ruptured thoracoabdominal AA group. Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated in-hospital mortality was positively associated with pulselessness (odds ratio [OR] 10.12; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.09-25.07), and negatively associated with invasive therapy (EVT and OS; OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.06-0.20). The outcomes of ruptured AAs remain poor; emergency invasive therapy is essential to save lives, although it remains challenging to reduce the risk of death."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the midterm efficacy and safety of a single-branch Castor stent graft in the treatment of thoracic aortic disease. Clinical data of 106 patients with thoracic aortic disease treated with Castor single-branch stent graft at 3 centers were collected between May 2018 and June 2023. The indicators included technical success, stent-related complication, reintervention, retrograde dissection, endoleak, distal stent graft-induced entry (dSINE), branch patency, and mortality. The outcomes of the Castor stent graft for multibranch reconstruction above the arch was also analyzed. The technical success was 98.1% (104/106), while the surgical success was 93.4% (99/106). The reintervention was 2.8% (3/106), consisting of a case of retrograde type A dissection, an endoleak, and a dSINE. The retrograde dissection was 1.9% (2/106), while type I endoleak was 1.9% (2/106). The new dSINE was 2.8% (3/106), and the branch patency rate was 100%. The mortality was 1.9% (2/106). The mean follow-up time was 29.1±17.7 months. The 2-year post-surgery cumulative survival rate was 91.0%±3.1%, while the cumulative branch patency rate was 96.2%±2.2%. In addition, the cumulative freedom from stent-related reintervention rate was 93.2%±2.8%. A comparison showed no significant difference in the stent-related complication, branch patency, endoleak, reintervention, and mortality when the proximal end of the Castor stent graft was anchored to zones 1 or 2 of the aorta. Castor single-branch stent graft showed favorable early and midterm outcomes in the treatment of thoracic aortic disease. In addition, it was feasible to combine Castor stent graft with other advanced techniques for multibranch aortic arch reconstruction.Clinical ImpactThe Castor single-branch stent graft was approval by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration in 2017. However, there were few studies on the mid-term outcomes for thoracic aortic disease after launching, which mainly focused on small single-center retrospective study. In the study, we assessed the mid-term outcomes of Castor stent graft through multi-center cases, Castor stent graft combined with other advanced techniques (such as fenestration and hybrid) for multi-branch reconstruction of aortic arch were also conducted. We found Castor single-branch stent graft showed favorable early and mid-term outcomes in the treatment of thoracic aortic disease. Additionally, it was feasible to combine Castor stent graft with other advanced technique for multi-branch aortic arch reconstruction. As an off-the-shelf branched stent graft with a wide range of models, it could be also used in most emergent situation. The Castor stent graft was expected to become more widely used in the future."

    "abstract": "Surgery for type A aortic dissection (TAAD) is associated with a high risk of early mortality. The prognostic impact of a new classification of the urgency of the procedure was evaluated in this multicenter cohort study. Data on consecutive patients who underwent surgery for acute TAAD were retrospectively collected in the multicenter, retrospective European Registry of TAAD (ERTAAD). The rates of in-hospital mortality of 3,902 consecutive patients increased along with the ERTAAD procedure urgency grades: urgent procedure 10.0%, emergency procedure grade 1 13.3%, emergency procedure grade 2 22.1%, salvage procedure grade 1 45.6%, and salvage procedure grade 2 57.1% (p <0.0001). Preoperative arterial lactate correlated with the urgency grades. Inclusion of the ERTAAD procedure urgency classification significantly improved the area under the receiver operating characteristics curves of the regression model and the integrated discrimination indexes and the net reclassification indexes. The risk of postoperative stroke/global brain ischemia, mesenteric ischemia, lower limb ischemia, dialysis, and acute heart failure increased along with the urgency grades. In conclusion, the urgency of surgical repair of acute TAAD, which seems to have a significant impact on the risk of in-hospital mortality, may be useful to improve the stratification of the operative risk of these critically ill patients. This study showed that salvage surgery for TAAD is justified because half of the patients may survive to discharge."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection type A (AADA) is a surgical emergency with relevant mortality and morbidity despite improvements in current management protocols. Identifying patients at risk of a fatal outcome and controlling the factors associated with mortality remain of paramount importance. In this retrospective observational study, we reviewed the medical records of 117 patients with AADA, who were referred to our centre and operated on between 2005 and 2021. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were analysed and tested for their correlation with in-hospital mortality. The overall survival rate was 83%. Preoperatively, factors associated with mortality were age (p = 0.02), chronic hypertension (p = 0.02), any grade of aortic valve stenosis in the patient's medical history (p = 0.03), atrial fibrillation (p = 0.04), and oral anticoagulation (p = 0.04). Non-survivors had significantly longer operative times (p = 0.002). During the postoperative phase, mortality was strongly associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) (p < 0.001), acute heart failure (p < 0.001), stroke (p = 0.02), focal neurological deficits (p = 0.02), and sepsis (p = 0.001). In the multivariate regression analysis, the onset of postoperative focal neurological deficits was the best predictor of a fatal outcome after adjusting for ARDS (odds ratio: 5.8, 95%-CI: 1.2-41.7, p = 0.04). In this retrospective analysis, atrial fibrillation, oral anticoagulation, hypertension, and age were significantly correlated with mortality. Postoperatively, acute kidney injury, acute heart failure, sepsis, and focal neurological deficits were correlated with in-hospital mortality, and focal neurological deficit has been identified as a significant predictor of fatal outcomes. Early detection and interdisciplinary management of at-risk patients remain crucial throughout the postoperative phase."

    "title": "Mechanical Thrombectomy via Transbrachial Approach in the Emergency Management of Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients with Aortic Pathologies: Our Experience and Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) via the transbrachial approach (TBA) is a very rare option used in cases of patients with aortic pathologies and acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to the insufficient evidence in the literature, the difficulty from a technical point of view and the result of this technique influenced by the complications that frequently accompany it. Only a few cases of patients with aortic pathologies and acute ischemic stroke where MT via TBA were reported in the literature, and its application in the emergency management of AIS has still not been dealt with in detail. Out of a need to clarify and clearly emphasize the effectiveness of this approach in emergency MT via TBA in patients with AIS and aortic pathologies, this literature review and case report has the following objectives: the first one is the presentation of an emergency MT via transbrachial approach performed in a 44-year-old patient with AIS and diagnosed aortic coarctation during transfemural approach (TFA), with successful reperfusion in our department and the second one is to review the cases reports of patients with different aortic pathologies and AIS reperfusion therapy performed by MT via TBA from the literature. A total of nine cases (one personal case and eight published cases) were revised in terms of aortic pathologies type, reperfusion therapy type, and the complication of both mechanical thrombectomy and local transbrachial approach. Mechanical thrombectomy through the transbrachial approach was the first choice in more than half of these cases (55.55%, n = 5 cases) in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke in the presence of previously diagnosed aortic pathologies. In one-third of all cases (33.33%, n = 3, our case and 2 case reports from the literature), the transbrachial approach was chosen after attempting to advance the guiding catheter through the transfemoral approach and intraprocedural diagnosis of aortic pathology. In only one case, after an ultrasound evaluation of the radial artery that showed a monophasic flow, MT was performed via TBA. Local transbrachial complication was reported in one case, and in two other cases, it was not stated if there were such complications. Hemorrhagic transformation of AIS was reported in two cases that underwent MT-only cerebral reperfusion via TBA, one with acute aortic dissection type A and our case of previously undiagnosed aortic coarctation. In the cases in whom short and long-term follow-up was reported, the outcome of treatment, which was not exclusively endovascular (77.77% cases with only MT and 33.33% with association of first thrombolysis and after MT), was good (six from nine patients). In two case reports, the outcomes were not stated, and one patient died after a long hospitalization in the intensive care unit from respiratory complications (our patient). Being a clinical emergency, acute ischemic stroke requires urgent medical intervention. In patients with aortic pathologies, where acute ischemic stroke emergency care is a challenge, mechanical thrombectomy via the transbrachial approach is a safe alternative method for cerebral reperfusion."

    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) are an increasingly prevalent pathology with significant associated morbidity and mortality. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is the primary line of treatment. The purpose of this study was to analyse a single center's experience in the treatment of TAAs and identify possible risk factors for worse outcomes. A retrospective review of our institutional database was done to identify all patients treated for TAAs in a 10-year period, from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2022. Data were extracted from patients' medical records. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality and secondary outcomes were procedure related morbidity (vascular access complications, medullary ischaemia, stroke, endoleaks, migration, aneurysm sac enlargement >5 mm) and need for reintervention at 1-, 6- and 12-month follow-up. A descriptive and inferential analysis of the data was performed. Statistical analyses were conducted using the IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software. We identified 34 patients treated for TAAs in this period. Mean age was 68 years [47-87] and 79.4% of patients were male. Mean aneurysm diameter was 63 mm [35-100], 55.9% fusiform and 44.1% saccular. The majority (91.2%) were located at the descending thoracic aorta and 3 (8.8%) of them extended to the aortic arch. The most common aetiology was degenerative in 22 patients (64.7%), followed by aortic dissection in 8 patients (23.5%). Elective surgery was performed in 19 (61.3%) patients and 12 (38.7%) had urgent repair. TEVAR was the treatment of choice in 24 (77.4%) patients, and the remaining 7 (22.6%) were treated with hybrid surgery. Mean length of hospital stay was 10 days [2-80] (6 days for elective repair versus 16 days for urgent repair, p = .016). Follow-up period ranged from 1 month to 10 years. At 1 year follow-up, all-cause mortality was 15%, morbidity was 30% (with 6 (22%) patients having a type Ia endoleak) and need for reintervention was 22%. Aneurysm diameter was a significant risk factor for procedure related morbidity (median diameter of 73.5 mm versus 56.0 mm in patients with no morbidity; p = .027). The presence of type Ia endoleak was significantly associated with higher reintervention rates (p = .001), but not with higher mortality rates (p = .515). Age, female sex, aetiology and urgent repair weren't associated with any significant differences in the outcomes. TEVAR proved to be effective in the treatment of TAAs, with good outcomes at short and mid-term follow-up. TAAs should be diagnosed earlier and be promptly treated when meeting criteria to prevent worse outcomes."

    "abstract": "Clinical outcomes following various surgical intervention strategies for aortic root and valve pathology during repair of acute type A aortic syndromes were studied and compared. From 2004 to 2019, 634 patients underwent acute type A aortic repair. Patients were divided into 4 groups: Valve Resuspension (n = 456), Isolated Valve Replacement (AVR) (n = 24), Valve and Root Replacement (ROOT) (n = 97), and Valve Sparing Root Replacement (VSRR) (n = 57). The primary endpoint was midterm survival and multivariable risk factor analysis was performed. The mean age was 55.4 ± 13 years, 424 (67%) were male, and overall early mortality was 12%. Early mortality was 13%, 8%, 11%, and 7% for the Valve Resuspension, AVR, ROOT, and VSRR groups respectively, p = 0.43. Five-year survival was 74%, 86%, 73%, and 84% for the Valve Resuspension, AVR, ROOT, and VSRR groups respectively, p = 0.46. There was no difference in late stroke, renal failure, heart block, and late bleeding (p > 0.05 for all). At late follow-up, AVR and ROOT patients had a higher mean gradient versus Valve Resuspension and VSRR patients, p < 0.0001. For the total cohort, risk factors for late mortality included preoperative peripheral vascular disease (hazard ratio (HR) 2.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-4.4, p = 0.009) and preoperative dialysis (HR 2.8, 95% CI 1.3-6.1, p = 0.01). Mid-term survival following repair of acute type A aortic dissection is not independently associated with a specific type of aortic valve intervention. Native valve preservation leads to acceptable mid-term valve hemodynamics and should be the preferred therapy in this emergent clinical setting.

Emergent open surgical repair of the ascending aorta is a life-saving operation and remains the standard of care for aTAAD with MMP, but is associated with a high rate of mortality. In recent years, reperfusion of superior mesenteric artery (SMA) by endovascular repair as the first treatment strategy in the treatment of aTAAD with MMP has been concerned and reported. Only endovascular repair and conservative medical treatment are also introduced in few cases with poor outcomes. There are many urgent issues that need to be addressed in current strategies.

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) progresses rapidly and is associated with high mortality; therefore, there remains an urgent need for pharmacological agents that can protect against AAD. Herein, we examined the therapeutic effects of cannabidiol (CBD) in AAD by establishing a suitable mouse model. In addition, we performed human AAD single-cell RNA sequencing and mouse AAD bulk RNA sequencing to elucidate the potential underlying mechanism of CBD. Pathological assays and in vitro studies were performed to verify the results of the bioinformatic analysis and explore the pharmacological function of CBD. In a β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN)-induced AAD mouse model, CBD reduced AAD-associated morbidity and mortality, alleviated abnormal enlargement of the ascending aorta and aortic arch, and suppressed macrophage infiltration and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) apoptosis. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the pro-apoptotic gene PMAIP1 was highly expressed in human and mouse AAD samples, and CBD could inhibit Pmaip1 expression in AAD mice. Using human aortic VSMCs (HAVSMCs) co-cultured with M1 macrophages, we revealed that CBD alleviated HAVSMCs mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis by suppressing the BAPN-induced overexpression of PMAIP1 in M1 macrophages. PMAIP1 potentially mediates HAVSMCs apoptosis by regulating Bax and Bcl2 expression. Accordingly, CBD reduced AAD-associated morbidity and mortality and mitigated the progression of AAD in a mouse model. The CBD-induced effects were potentially mediated by suppressing macrophage infiltration and PMAIP1 (primarily expressed in macrophages)-induced VSMC apoptosis. Our findings offer novel insights into M1 macrophages and HAVSMCs interaction during AAD progression, highlighting the potential of CBD as a therapeutic candidate for AAD treatment."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a pressing cardiovascular emergency necessitating prompt surgical intervention. Obesity, a pervasive health concern, has been identified as a significant risk factor for ATAAD, introducing unique surgical challenges that can influence postoperative outcomes. This study aimed to investigate the outcomes of ATAAD surgery across various body mass index (BMI) categories, focusing on the implications of the upper hemisternotomy (UHS) approach. Between April 2017 and October 2023, 229 patients diagnosed with ATAAD underwent aortic arch intervention via UHS at the General Hospital of Northern Theater Command. Based on BMI (WS/T 428-2013), patients were categorized into normal weight, overweight, and obese. The primary outcomes included perioperative parameters, intraoperative details, and postoperative complications, with specific emphasis on hypoxemia, defined by the Berlin criteria as a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of ≤300 mmHg. The average age of the cohort was 50.1 ± 11.2 years with a male predominance (174 males). Preoperatively, 49.0% presented with hypoxemia, with the Obese group exhibiting a significantly elevated rate (77.9%, P < 0.001). Postoperatively, while the Normal group demonstrated a lower thoracic drainage volume 24 h post-surgery [180.0 (140.0) ml; P < 0.001], the Obese group indicated prolonged durations for mechanical ventilation and ICU stay, without statistical significance. Unlike the Normal and Overweight groups, the Obese group showed no notable changes in pre- and postoperative PaO2/FiO2 ratio. No significant difference was observed in severe postoperative complications among the groups. Further ROC curve analysis identifies a BMI cutoff of 25.5 for predicting postoperative hypoxemia, with 76.3% sensitivity and 84.4% specificity. And multivariate analysis reveals BMI and preoperative hypoxemia as independent predictors of postoperative hypoxemia. Obesity, although presenting unique challenges in ATAAD interventions, does not necessarily portend adverse outcomes when managed with meticulous surgical planning and postoperative care. The study emphasizes the significance of individualized patient assessment and tailoring surgical strategies, suggesting the potential of UHS in addressing the surgical intricacies posed by obesity in ATAAD patients. Further research is warranted to consolidate these findings."

In an elderly patient with a history of hypertension, ischemic changes on electrocardiogram, and nonspecific pain, AAS should be on the emergency physician's differential even in the setting of a benign or limited history and exam."

    "abstract": "Acute Stanford type A aortic dissection (STAAD) is a fatal condition requiring urgent surgical intervention. Owing to the complexity of the surgical process, various complications, such as neurological disorders, are common. In this study, we prioritized the reconstruction of aortic arch branches during surgery and investigated the association between prioritizing the branches and the postoperative outcomes of patients with STAAD. Ninety-seven patients were included in the observational study and underwent total arch replacement and frozen elephant trunk technique between January 2018 and June 2021. Of these, 35 patients underwent the branch-priority technique, and 62 patients underwent the classic technique. By analyzing the perioperative outcomes, we compared the differences between the two techniques. The branch priority group had significantly shorter cardiopulmonary bypass and ventilator times and earlier postoperative wake-up times than the classic group. Additionally, the ICU stay time was shorter, with a significant decrease in neurological complications and 24 h drainage in the branch priority group compared to the classic group. The branch priority technique can effectively provide better brain protection, resulting in earlier awakening of patients after surgery, reduced neurological complications, shorter ventilation time and decreased ICU hospitalization time. Therefore, it is recommended for use in aortic dissection surgeries."

    "title": "Chest Pain Risk Stratification in the Emergency Department: Current Perspectives.",
    "abstract": "Chest pain is the second leading cause of all emergency department (ED) visits in adults in the United States, with nearly 11 million encounters yearly. While identifying low-risk patients is crucial for early discharge, identifying high-risk patients in ED is vital in timely and appropriate acute coronary syndrome (ACS) management. Traditional methods such as physical examination, cardiac markers, or imaging tests cannot reliably confirm or rule out ACS; they cannot be singularly incorporated to risk stratify patients. Various clinical risk scores have been proposed to address this challenge for risk stratification in patients being evaluated for suspected ACS. The ideal risk score should demonstrate high sensitivity and specificity to accurately differentiate between patients with varying levels of risk, particularly in identifying those at high risk for major adverse cardiovascular events. Simultaneously, an ideal scoring system should also be able to compute information for other non-coronary etiologies of chest pain that require time-sensitive interventions and workups (eg, aortic dissection and pulmonary embolism). In this review, we have assembled major risk scores used for risk stratification in patients with acute chest pain in ED. We have abbreviated their salient features to assist readers in their clinical decision-making."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (AAAD) has a high probability of postoperative adverse outcomes (PAO) after emergency surgery, so exploring the risk factors for PAO during hospitalization is key to reducing postoperative mortality and improving prognosis. An artificial intelligence approach was used to build a predictive model of PAO by clinical data-driven machine learning to predict the incidence of PAO after total arch repair for AAAD. This study included 380 patients with AAAD. The clinical features that are associated with PAO were selected using the LASSO regression analysis. Six different machine learning algorithms were tried for modeling, and the performance of each model was analyzed comprehensively using receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration curve, precision recall curve, and decision analysis curves. Explain the optimal model through Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) and perform an individualized risk assessment. After comprehensive analysis, the authors believe that the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model is the optimal model, with better performance than other models. The authors successfully built a prediction model for PAO in AAAD patients based on the XGBoost algorithm and interpreted the model with the SHAP method, which helps to identify high-risk AAAD patients at an early stage and to adjust individual patient-related clinical treatment plans in a timely manner."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection in pregnant patients results in an inpatient mortality rate of 8.6%. Owing to the pronounced mortality rate and speed at which aortic dissections progress, efficient early detection methods are crucial. Here, we highlight the importance of early chest computed tomography (CT) for differentiating aortic dissection from pulmonary embolism in pregnant patients with dyspnea. We present the unique case of a 38-year-old pregnant woman with elevated D-dimer and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels, initially suspected of having a pulmonary embolism. Initial transthoracic echocardiography did not indicate aortic dissection. Surprisingly, after an emergency cesarean section, a chest CT scan revealed a DeBakey type I aortic dissection, indicating a diagnostic error. Our findings emphasize the need for early chest CT in pregnant patients with dyspnea and elevated D-dimer and NT-proBNP levels. This case report highlights the critical importance of considering both aortic dissection and pulmonary embolism in the differential diagnosis of such cases, which will inform future clinical practice."

The data to support this statement rely solely on patients who have been denied surgical treatment after reaching surgical centres. The objective was to perform a total review of non-surgically treated (NST) ATAAD and provide contemporary mortality data. This was a regional, retrospective, observational study. All patients receiving one of the following diagnoses: International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 4410, 4411, 4415, 4416 or ICD-10 I710, I711, I715, I718 in an area of 1.9 million inhabitants in Southern Sweden during a period of 23 years (January 1998 to November 2021) were retrospectively screened. The search was conducted using all available medical registries so that every patient diagnosed with ATAAD in our region was identified. The charts and imaging of each screened patient were subsequently reviewed to confirm or discard the diagnosis of ATAAD. Screening identified 2325 patients, of whom 184 NST ATAAD patients were included. The mortality of NST ATAAD was 47.3 ± 4.4%, 55.0 ± 4.4%, 76.7 ± 3.7% and 83.9 ± 4.3% at 24 h, 48 h, 14 days and 1 year, respectively. The hourly mortality rate during the 1st 24 h after symptom onset was 2.6%. This study observed higher mortality than has previously been reported.

    "abstract": "To investigate the independent risk factors for postoperative prolonged ICU stay in patients with Stanford type A aortic dissection (TAAD) and assess the clinical outcomes of prolonged ICU stay. The clinical data of 100 patients with TAAD admitted to the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University from December 2018 to September 2022 were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups, based on the postoperative ICU stay (7 days as the threshold), regular ICU stay group (< 7 days) and prolonged ICU stay group (≥ 7 days). First, preoperative and intraoperative materials were collected for univariate analysis. Then, the significant variables after univariate analysis were analyzed using logistic regression, and the final independent risk factors for prolonged ICU stay were determined. Meanwhile, the postoperative clinical outcomes were analyzed with the aim of assessing the clinical outcomes due to prolonged ICU stay. There were 65 and 35 patients in the regular ICU stay group and the prolonged ICU stay group, respectively. In accordance with the result of univariate analysis in the two groups, emergency surgery (χ2 = 13.598; P < 0.001), preoperative urea nitrogen (t = 3.006; P = 0.004), cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time (t = 2.671; P = 0.001) and surgery time (t = 2.630; P = 0.010) were significant. All significant variates were analyzed through logistic regression, and it was found that emergency surgery (OR = 0.192; 95% CI: 0.065-0.561), preoperative urea nitrogen (OR = 0.775; 95% CI: 0.634-0.947) and cardiopulmonary time (OR = 0.988; 95% CI: 0.979-0.998) were independent risk factors for prolonged postoperative ICU stay. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves of these three factors were also effective in predicting postoperative prolonged ICU stay (Emergency surgery, AUC = 0.308, 95% CI: 0.201-0.415; Preoperative urea nitrogen, AUC = 0.288, 95% CI: 0.185-0.392; cardiopulmonary time, AUC = 0.340, 95% CI: 0.223-0.457). Moreover, compared with a single factor, the predictive value of combined factors was more significant (AUC = 0.810, 95% CI: 0.722-0.897). For the comparison of postoperative data in the two groups,, compared with the regular ICU stay group, the incidence of adverse events in the prolonged ICU stay group increased significantly, including limb disability of limbs (χ2 = 22.182; P < 0.001), severe organ injury (χ2 = 23.077; P < 0.001), tracheotomy (χ2 = 17.582; P < 0.001), reintubation (χ2 = 28.020; P < 0.001), 72 h tracheal extubation after surgery (χ2 = 29.335; P < 0.001), 12 h consciousness recovery after surgery (χ2 = 18.445; P < 0.001), ICU re-entering (χ2 = 9.496; P = 0.002) and irregular discharging (χ2 = 24.969; P < 0.001). Emergency surgery, preoperative urea nitrogen, and CPB time are risk factors for postoperative prolonged ICU stay after TAAD surgery. Furthermore, prolonged ICU stay is associated with worse clinical outcomes. Hence, a reasonable strategy should be adopted proactively focusing on the risk factors to shorten ICU stays and improve clinical outcomes."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic syndrome (AAS) is an emergency associated with high peri-hospital mortality rates. Variable clinical presentation makes timely diagnosis challenging and such delays in diagnosis directly impact patient outcomes. The aims of the Collaborative Acute Aortic Syndrome Project (CAASP) are to characterise and evaluate the current AAS pathways of a cohort of hospitals in the UK, USA and New Zealand to determine if patient outcomes are influenced by the AAS pathway (time to hospital admission, diagnosis and management plan) and demographic, social, geographic and patient-specific factors (clinical presentation and comorbidities). The objectives are to describe different AAS pathways and time duration between hospital admission to diagnosis and management plan instigation, and to compare patient outcomes between pathways. The study is a multicentre, retrospective service evaluation project of adult patients diagnosed on imaging with AAS. It will be coordinated by the UK National Interventional Radiology Trainee Research (UNITE) network and Vascular and Endovascular Research Network (VERN) in conjunction with The Aortic Dissection Charitable Trust (TADCT). All AAS cases diagnosed on imaging between 1st January 2018 to 1st June 2021 will be included and followed-up for 6 months. Eligibility criteria include aortic dissection (AD) Type A, Type B, non A/B, penetrating aortic ulcer, and intramural haematoma. Exclusion criteria are non-AAS pathology, acute on chronic AAS, and age<18. This project will evaluate patient demographics, timing of presentation, patient symptoms, risk factors for AD, physical examination findings, timing to imaging and treatment, hospital stay, and mortality. Univariate and multivariate analysis will be used to identify predictors associated with prolonged time to diagnosis or treatment and mortality at 30 days."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a life-threatening emergency that is associated with major morbidity and mortality. Arterial dissections, particularly the brachiocephalic artery, can remain as a residual dissection after type A aortic dissection repair. We present a rare case of brachiocephalic artery dissection due to the clamping effect and the management of ATAAD patients. A 47-year-old male known for aortic aneurysm and uncontrolled hypertension presented with high blood pressure, unequal pulses, and a history of chest pain. A thoracic and abdominal aorta angiogram showed aneurysmal dilatation of the aortic root and ascending aorta with a peripheral linear filling defect shortly distal to the aortic root. The patient underwent the Bentall procedure, hemi-arch replacement, and patent ductus arteriosus closure. The brachiocephalic artery was clamped. The angiogram showed right common carotid occlusion. Endovascular intervention was made by balloon-mounted covered stent graft and kissing technique. The patient had a smooth post-procedure period without major events. Iatrogenic brachiocephalic artery dissection can occur during type A aortic dissection repair and is frequently affected by residual dissection. The decision of intervention versus conservative management is based on a patient's general condition."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between post-implantation syndrome (PIS) and long-term prognosis in patients with Stanford type B aortic dissection (TBAD) undergoing thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). This retrospective study included 547 consecutive patients diagnosed with TBAD who underwent TEVAR at our institution between January 2014 and December 2019. Patients were categorized into two groups: the PIS group (patients with post-TEVAR PIS) and the non-PIS group (patients without post-TEVAR PIS). In-hospital and follow-up data were analyzed. The incidence of PIS was 28.9% (158/547 patients). No baseline differences were observed between the PIS (n = 158) and the non-PIS (n = 389) groups. The proportion of emergency surgery in the PIS group was higher than that in the non-PIS group (44.9% vs 26.0%; P < .001), the operation time was longer (median, 65.0; interquartile range [IQR], 56.0-75.0 minutes vs 56.0; IQR, 45.0-66.0 minutes; P < .001), the volume of contrast medium used (median, 65.0; IQR, 56.0-75.0 mL vs 56.0; IQR, 45.0-66.0 mL; P < .001), and the average number of trunk stents (1.85 ± 0.4 vs 1.34 ± 0.5 pieces; P < .001) and branch stents (0.7 ± 0.7 vs 0.2 ± 0.5 pieces; P < .001) used were more in the PIS group than in the non-PIS group. The incidence of supra-aortic branch procedures was higher in the PIS group than in the non-PIS group. There was no significant difference in device-related complications (DRCs) or 30-day mortality between the two groups (2.5% vs 4.4%; P = .442 and 1.3% vs 1.3%; P = .688, respectively). Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that emergency surgery, number of trunk stents >1, operation time >58.5 minutes, and contrast medium volume >75 mL were risk factors for PIS, and the odds ratios of emergency operation, number of trunk stents >1 piece, operation time >58.5 minutes, and contrast medium volume >75 mL were 2.526 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.530-4.173), 4.651 (95% CI, 2.838-7.624), 3.577 (95% CI, 2.201-5.815), and 7.356 (95% CI, 4.111-13.160), respectively. Follow-up was completed in 98.5% (532/540) of the patients, with a median follow-up of 67 months (IQR, 50-86 months). There was no significant difference in survival between the PIS and non-PIS groups (12.4% vs 10.3%; P = .476) during follow-up. The incidences of DRCs (7.8% vs 11.6%; P = .200) and aortic false lumen thrombosis (75.8% vs 79.2%; P = .399) were comparable between the PIS and non-PIS groups. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that PIS had no effect on long-term follow-up mortality, DRCs, entry flow, or aortic false lumen thrombosis rate. PIS is relatively common after TEVAR and emergency surgery; number of trunk stents >1, operation time >58.5 minutes, and contrast medium volume >75 mL are of high predictive value for the assessment of PIS after TEVAR. However, PIS had little effect on early and late postoperative mortality or DRCs."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) with impaired perfusion of the left coronary artery has a poor prognosis, even after urgent radical aortic surgery, due to extensive myocardial damage. Although Impella, a microaxial-flow catheter pump, is useful in managing acute myocardial infarction, it is generally contraindicated in patients with AAD because it is an intra-aortic device and the aortic structure is compromised in these cases. Here, we introduce a novel intervention that allowed a planned aortic repair after managing circulation using Impella and venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in a case of AAD with left main trunk malperfusion. A 40-year-old man presented with cardiogenic shock. Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed to address left main trunk obstruction using an intra-aortic balloon pump; however, circulatory instability persisted. The patient was transferred to our hospital after venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Impella CP™ was used to improve his circulatory status. However, a subsequent CT scan confirmed an AAD diagnosis. After 5 days of stable circulatory support, the patient underwent aortic root replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting. In patients with AAD and coronary malperfusion, adjunctive circulatory management with Impella may be a valuable therapeutic option."

He did not successfully transfer his concern to the physicians and the patient was sent home. The next day, she was transferred to another hospital with a recurrence of the symptom, and the diagnosis of TAAAD was made with a CT scan there. Case 2 was an 87-year-old female who was transferred to our hospital because of a loss of consciousness and bruises on the forehead. CT scan was taken and the displaced intimal flap in her aortic arch was overlooked by the part-time physician almost at the end of his shift. The diagnosis of TAAAD was made by the radiologist. Case 3 was the 44-year-old male who did not have health insurance and experienced severe back pain a few days before the visit to our clinic. On that day, he went to the nearby hospital's emergency room, and only pain medication was prescribed. A few days later, a CT scan was taken at our hospital to investigate the cause of pyuria and the diagnosis of TAAAD was made. DD may be common and multifactorial in our practice.

From 1996 to February 2023, a total of 106 patients with acute type A IMH and 795 patients with classic ATAAD presented for open aortic repair at our institution. Data were obtained from the local Society of Thoracic Surgeons' Data Warehouse and medical chart review. Compared with the classic ATAAD group, the IMH group was older (65 vs 59 years, P < .001) and more likely to be female (45% vs 32%, P = .005), with fewer comorbidities such as severe aortic insufficiency (5.0% vs 25%, P < .001), acute stroke (2.8% vs 8.3%, P = .05), acute renal failure (5.7% vs 13%, P = .04), and malperfusion syndrome (8.5% vs 26%, P < .001) but more cardiac tamponade (18% vs 11%, P = .03).

    "abstract": "With ongoing advances in both medical and surgical management, the population of adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) continues to grow each year and has surpassed the number of pediatric cases. These adult patients will present to adult emergency departments with increasing frequency. Adults with CHD are at increased risk of developing not only cardiovascular complications, such as aortic dissection and thromboemboli, but also abdominopelvic and neurologic processes at younger ages. These individuals are also more likely to develop less urgent but clinically significant complications including end-organ dysfunction, baffle leaks, or bleeding collateral vessels. Ultimately, imaging can play a critical role in determining the triage, diagnosis, and management of adult CHD patients. To accomplish this goal, radiologists must be able to distinguish acute and chronic complications of treated CHD from benign processes, including expected post-surgical changes or imaging artifacts. Radiologists also need to be familiar with the various long-term risks and complications associated with both treated and untreated forms of CHD, particularly those in adults with complex lesions."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a life-threatening medical condition with high early fatality. Therefore, a prompt and precise diagnosis, which can be achieved through invasive and non-invasive techniques is vital. Echocardiography, unlike MRI and CT, is accessible in emergency units and bedside-compatible. The recommended echocardiographic techniques for AAD are transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography (TTE and TOE). Therefore, our review compares their diagnostic roles in AAD. Studies relevant to our topic were attained through a database search and manual scrutiny of references lists of articles obtained from the electronic databases. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool (QUADAS-2) has been used for quality assessment. All quantitative analyses were performed using either STATA 16 or Comprehensive Meta-Analyst software. The search strategy yielded 1,798 articles, of which only 11 were eligible for inclusion. Our subgroup analysis showed that conventional TTE had a sensitivity and specificity of 85.35% and 84.51% for the diagnosis of Stanford type A AAD and was 45.89% sensitive and 87.05% specific for the diagnosis of type B AAD. However, the subgroup analysis shows that contrast-enhancement of TTE results in a sensitivity and specificity of 93.30% and 97.60% for diagnosis of type A AAD, and 83.60% and 94.50% for diagnosis of type B AAD, respectively. On the other hand, conventional TOE was 93.64% sensitive and 95.50% specific for the diagnosis of type A AAD, 99.80% sensitive and 99.87% specific for the diagnosis of type B AAD. Moreover, our analyses show that TTE has pooled false negative and positive rates of 28.6% and 18.6%, while TOE has shown false negative and positive rates of 2.4% and 4.3%, respectively. TOE is the more favorable diagnostic tool for AAD diagnosis than TTE. However, it cannot be used as a stand-alone diagnostic tool since misdiagnosis cases are being reported. Contrast-enhanced TTE can also diagnose AAD since it provides similar results to conventional TOE."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a dramatic emergency exhibiting a mortality of 50% within the first 48 hours if not operated. This study found an absolute value of cosine-like seasonal variation pattern for Germany with significantly fewer ATAAD events (Wilcoxon test) for the warm months of June, July, and August from 2005 to 2015. Many studies suspect a connection between ATAAD events and weather conditions. Using ERA5 reanalysis data and an objective weather type classification in a contingency table approach showed that for Germany, significantly more ATAAD events occurred during lower temperatures (by about 4.8 K), lower water vapor pressure (by about 2.6 hPa), and prevailing wind patterns from the northeast. In addition, we used data from a classification scheme for human-biometeorological weather conditions which was not used before in ATAAD studies. For the German region of Berlin and Brandenburg, for 2006 to 2019, the proportion of days with ATAAD events during weather conditions favoring hypertension (cold air advection, in the center of a cyclone, conditions with cold stress or thermal comfort) was significantly increased by 13% (Chi-squared test for difference of proportions). In contrast, the proportion was decreased by 19% for conditions associated with a higher risk for patients with hypotension and therefore a lower risk for patients with hypertension (warm air advection ahead of warm fronts, conditions with no thermal stress or heat stress, in the center of a cyclone with thermal stress). As many studies have shown that hypertension is a risk factor for ATAAD, our findings support the hypothesized relation between ATAAD and hypertension-favoring weather conditions."

    "abstract": "Surgery for acute type A aortic dissection is highly challenging, even in expert hands. The goal in such emergency circumstances is primarily to save the patient's life. To minimize the perioperative risk, surgeons often choose surgery involving only supracoronary ascending aortic and hemiarch replacement. However, to achieve a successful repair, the extremely fragile dissected aortic layers must be reconstructed proximally and distally. Most of the surgical procedures for patients with acute type A aortic dissection are supracoronary ascending aortic replacements. Thereby, the Florida sleeve procedure is an attractive alternative for reimplanting the entire aortic root into a Dacron graft. This approach has overcome most of the technical problems associated with composite valve graft or valve-sparing procedures. The frozen elephant trunk procedure is particularly appealing for treating acute type A aortic dissection because of its ability to treat malperfusion by encouraging true lumen expansion and potentially reducing longer-term adverse remodelling within the descending aorta."

    "abstract": "We sought to examine midterm results and remodeling effect of false-lumen occlusion treatment using AFX VELA in case of chronic dissection repair. From June 2019 to May 2022, we performed false lumen occlusion treatment using a modified Candy-Plug technique with AFX VELA on 8 chronic aortic dissection patients with a patent false lumen. We collected operative data, short-term clinical outcomes, mid-term clinical outcomes and imaging test results. We conducted follow-up examinations at postoperative, 6-month and 1-, 2- and 3-year intervals, including contrast-enhanced computed tomography to evaluate the diameter, false lumen thrombosis and any events. The average time from the symptom onset to the thoracic endovascular repair was 81.5 (35-155) months. The aorta showed aneurysmal dilation with an average maximum short-axis diameter of 58.9 (41-91) mm. Two cases needed emergency surgery due to rupture and impending rupture. There were no postoperative deaths. Complete thrombosis within the false lumen was achieved in 6 cases (75%), but 2 cases had incomplete thrombosis, requiring additional treatment. The mean maximum diameter showed a significant decrease at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years postoperatively compared to preoperative measurements (P < .05). We showed the results of false lumen occlusion treatment using the AFX VELA cuff. We observed favorable clinical outcomes and remodeling effects. While the long-term durability and efficacy of this technique in aortic remodeling will need to be monitored with further observation, the use of this cuff is considered a reliable approach to false lumen occlusion treatment."

    "title": "Factors Associated with Newly Developed Postoperative Neurological Complications in Patients with Emergency Surgery for Acute Type A Aortic Dissection.",
    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Postoperative neurological complications (NCs) are an important cause of mortality in patients with acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD). The aim of the study was to determine the association between intraoperative risk factors and newly developed postoperative NCs in patients after emergency surgery for ATAAD. Materials and Methods: A total of 203 patients requiring emergency surgery were included in the study. Patients with preoperative neurological dysfunction, deceased on the operating table or within the first 48 h after intensive care admission, with uncertain postoperative neurologic status or with incomplete records were excluded. Results: Mean age was 57.61 ± 12.27 years. Hyperlipidemia was the most frequent comorbidity (69%). A bicuspid aortic valve was present in 12.8% of cases, severe acute aortic regurgitation was present in 29.1% of patients, and cardiac tamponade was present in 27.1% of cases. The innominate artery was the most frequently dissected supra-aortic artery in 27.1% of cases. In 65% of cases, the primary entry tear was at the level of the ascending aorta. The incidence of newly developed postoperative NCs was 39.4%. The most common surgical technique performed was supra-coronary ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement, in 53.2% of patients. Using logistic regression, cardiopulmonary bypass time (OR = 1.01; 95% CI = 1.01-1.02; p < 0.001), aortic cross-clamp time over 3 h (OR = 2.71, 95% CI = 1.43-5.14, p = 0.002) and cerebral perfusion time (OR = 1.02; 95% CI = 1.002-1.03; p = 0.027) were independently associated with newly developed postoperative NCs. Conclusions: Based on the results of the study, all efforts should be made to reduce operative times. Using a simple surgical technique, like the supra-coronary ascending aorta and hemiarch technique, whenever possible, and using a simpler technique for cerebral perfusion like unilateral cerebral perfusion via the right axillary artery, could reduce operating times."

    "title": "Mortality and risk factors associated with misdiagnosis of acute aortic syndrome in Ontario, Canada: a population-based study.",
    "abstract": "Acute aortic syndrome (AAS) is a life-threatening aortic emergency. It describes three diagnoses: acute aortic dissection, acute intramural haematoma and penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer. Unfortunately, there are no accurate estimates of the miss rate for AAS, risk factors for missed diagnosis or its effect on outcomes. A population-based retrospective cohort study of anonymously linked data for residents of Ontario, Canada, was carried out. Incident cases of AAS were identified between 2003 and 2018 using a validated algorithm based on ICD codes and death. Before multivariate modelling, all categorical variables were analysed for an association with missed AAS diagnosis using χ2 tests. These preliminary analyses were unadjusted for clustering or any covariates. Finally, we performed multilevel logistic regression analysis using a generalised linear mixed model approach to model the probability of a missed case occurring. There were 1299 cases of AAS (age mean (SD) 68.03±14.70, woman 500 (38.5%), rural areas (n=111, 8.55%)) over the study period. Missed cases accounted for 163 (12.5%) of the cohort. Mortality (non-missed AAS 59.7% vs missed AAS 54.6%) and surgical intervention (non-missed AAS 31% vs missed AAS 30.7%) were similar in missed and non-missed cases. However, lower acuity (Canadian triage acuity scale >2 (OR 2.45 95% CI 1.71 to 3.52) (the scale is from 1 to 5, with 1 indicating high acuity) had a higher odds of being a missed case and non-ambulatory presentation (OR 0.47 95% CI 0.33 to 0.67) and presenting to a teaching (OR 0.60 95% CI 0.40 to 0.90)) or cardiac centre (OR 0.41 95% CI 0.27 to 0.62) were associated with a lower odds of being a missed case. The high rate of misdiagnosis has remained stable for over a decade. Non-teaching and non-cardiac hospitals had a higher incidence of missed cases. Mortality and rates of surgery were not associated with a missed diagnosis of AAS. Educational interventions should be prioritised in non-teaching hospitals and non-cardiac centres."

    "abstract": "Andexanet alfa (AnAl) is utilized for the urgent reversal of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in cases of severe bleeding. While the guidelines from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons recommend AnAl for urgent cardiac surgery in patients treated with DOACs, concerns persist regarding the potential of AnAl to induce heparin resistance. This report details the case of an 85-year-old woman diagnosed with acute type A aortic dissection, who received AnAl due to prior edoxaban use. During the emergent aortic surgery, she exhibited heparin resistance following the administration of unfractionated heparin (UFH). The administration of antithrombin III (ATIII) significantly influenced activated clotting times, facilitating successful surgery while maintaining adequate anticoagulation. This case underscores the importance of cautious management of AnAl-induced heparin resistance during critical surgeries, emphasizing the role of ATIII supplementation for effective anticoagulation."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection is treated with an emergency procedure that uses ascending aortic replacement (AAR). However, to avoid a residual dissected aorta with a false lumen, total arch replacement (TAR) is required. The frozen elephant trunk (FET) technique is a promising surgical approach that promotes false lumen obliteration in a single step. Therefore, this retrospective single-center study aimed to evaluate the operative outcomes of AAR and TAR with FET. Between 2007 and 2021, 143 patients with acute DeBakey type I aortic dissection underwent a central repair using AAR (n = 95) or TAR with FET (n = 43). All perioperative variables, the duration of all-cause mortality, and aortic events defined as dilatation of the distal aorta > 5 cm, new occurrences of aortic dissection, distal aortic surgery, and distal aortic rupture were recorded. We compared these perioperative variables and mid-term results with an additional focus on distal aortic events. Patient background data did not differ between the two groups. Perioperative results for the TAR with FET group vs the AAR group showed similar operative times (306 vs 298 min, P = 0.862), but the TAR group had longer cardiopulmonary bypass times (154 vs 179 min, P < 0.001). The freedom from all-cause death for the TAR vs AAR groups using the Kaplan-Meier method was 81.9% vs 85.4% and 78.0% vs 85.4% (P = 0.407) at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Freedom from aorta-related events was 90.6% vs 97.6% and 69.3% vs 87.0% (P = 0.034) at 1 and 3 years, respectively. TAR with FET had comparable perioperative results to AAR in acute DeBakey type I aortic dissection and was considered a valuable method to avoid aorta-related events in the midterm."

    "abstract": "Background There have so far been no reports regarding whether or not the jugular veins remain distended even in cases of cardiac arrest, which is the worst form of shock. We focused on the diameter of the jugular vein in neck computed tomography (CT) in cases of thoracic aortic disease resulting in cardiac arrest to determine whether or not cardiac tamponade increased the diameter. Methodology From January 2014 to December 2021, patients were eligible for inclusion when they were transported to our hospital, judged to be in cardiac arrest at the emergency department, and then diagnosed with thoracic aortic disease as the cause of cardiac arrest according to CT. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence (tamponade (+)) or absence (tamponade (-)) of cardiac tamponade. Comparisons between the two groups were also conducted after excluding cases in which relief of cardiac tamponade was obtained before CT or that had hemothorax. Results There were 52 cases in the cardiac tamponade (+) group and 16 in the cardiac tamponade (-) group. The diameters of both the right and left internal jugular veins were significantly larger in the cardiac tamponade (+) group than in the cardiac tamponade (-) group. After excluding cases with relief of cardiac tamponade before CT and hemothorax complications, the right and left internal and external jugular vein diameters in the cardiac tamponade (+) group were still significantly greater than those in the cardiac tamponade (-) group. Conclusions The present study showed that the cardiac tamponade induced by thoracic aortic cases tended to display larger internal jugular vein diameters compared to cases without cardiac tamponade, even in patients experiencing cardiac arrest. Additionally, cardiac tamponade consistently presented with larger diameters in the right-sided jugular vein."

    "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is the main cause of morbidity and mortality globally. This occurs due to occlusion of the coronary artery resulting in ischemia of the cardiac muscles. Typical symptoms include chest pain and discomfort. However, there are atypical symptoms including, but not limited to epigastric pain, nausea, and syncope. Such atypical symptoms upon presentation to the emergency department make it rather easy to overlook a potential MI. We present a case of a 70-year-old woman who had a delayed presentation to the emergency department with epigastric pain, nausea, and syncope. A nongated CT scan of the chest was utilized to rule out an aortic dissection. Interestingly, an unsuspected finding of a right coronary artery occlusion was detected instead. The patient underwent coronary artery stenting and was discharged a week later with a beta-blocker, dual antiplatelet therapy, a diuretic, and an anti-reflux medication. Overall, this case report emphasizes the importance of recognizing other atypical presentations in relation to MI. Additionally, this highlights the importance of the clinician's role in assessing the heart and coronary arteries when evaluating CT scans."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to develop a model for predicting the risk of prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) following surgical repair of acute type A aortic dissection (AAAD). We retrospectively collected clinical data from 381 patients with AAAD who underwent emergency surgery. Clinical features variables for predicting postoperative PMV were selected through univariate analysis, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis, and multivariate logistic regression analysis. A risk prediction model was established using a nomogram. The model's accuracy and reliability were evaluated using the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve and the calibration curve. Internal validation of the model was performed using bootstrap resampling. The clinical applicability of the model was assessed using decision curve analysis and clinical impact curve. Among the 381 patients, 199 patients (52.2%) experienced postoperative PMV. The predictive model exhibited good discriminative ability (area under the curve = 0.827, 95% confidence interval: 0.786-0.868, P < 0.05). The calibration curve confirmed that the predicted outcomes of the model closely approximated the ideal curve, indicating agreement between the predicted and actual results (with an average absolute error of 0.01 based on 1000 bootstrap resampling). The decision curve analysis curve demonstrated that the model has significant clinical value. The nomogram model established in this study can be used to predict the risk of postoperative PMV in patients with AAAD. It serves as a practical tool to assist clinicians in adjusting treatment strategies promptly and implementing targeted therapeutic measures."

    "abstract": "The risk of aortic dissection (AoD) is increased in Turner syndrome (TS) but predicting those at risk is difficult. Based on scarce evidence, preventive aortic surgery is recommended when aortic diameter increases >5 mm/year. To investigate the aortic growth rate in TS and TS-related conditions associated with aortic growth. We also reported our experience of women who suffered aortic dissection (AoD), and who had preventive aortic replacement. 151 adult TS were retrospectively identified. Women who had more than one transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) after age 16 years were included in the aortic growth study. Aortic diameters at sinuses of Valsalva (SoV) and ascending aorta (AA) were analysed by two experts. 70/151 women had more than one TTE (interscan interval 4.7 years). Mean aortic growth was 0.13 ± 0.59 mm/year at SoV and 0.23 ± 0.82 mm/year at AA. Known risk factors for aortic dilatation and TS-related conditions were not associated with aortic growth. 4/151 women experienced AoD (age 25±8 years): two had paired scans for aortic growth, which was 0.67 mm/year at both SoV and AA in the first woman, and 11 mm/year (SoV) and 4 mm/year (AA) in the second. Only 1/4 of women with AoD survived; she used a TS cardiac-alert card to inform emergency personnel about her risk of AoD. 5/151 had a preventive aortic replacement, but one died post-operatively. Mean aortic growth in our TS population was increased compared to non-TS women and was not associated with currently known risk factors for AoD, suggesting that aortic growth rate itself could be a useful variable to stratify who is at risk for AoD."

    "abstract": "Outcomes of Marfan syndrome (MFS) patients after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are poorly documented in the literature. The purpose of this study was to evaluate MFS as a potential risk factor for complications after TKA. Using a national private payer insurance database from 2010 to 2022, MFS patients undergoing primary TKA were identified and compared to 10:1 matched controls based on age, sex, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and a comorbidity index. A total of 4,092 patients undergoing primary TKA were analyzed, of which 372 had MFS. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were done for medical complications up to 90 days and surgical complications up to 2 years. 90-day emergency department-visits and inpatient readmissions were also documented. Compared to the matched controls, patients who have MFS displayed elevated rates of surgical complications, including prosthetic instability (1-year, odds ratio (OR) 3.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.58 to 8.66]; 2-year, OR 4.39, 95% CI [2.16 to 8.44]), and revision surgery (2 year, OR 1.79, 95% CI [1.05 to 2.91]). Additionally, patients who have MFS demonstrated significant higher rates of medical complications, including aortic dissection (2.15 versus 0%) and transfusion (OR 2.63, 95% CI [1.31 to 4.90]). Patients who have MFS are at higher risks of postoperative complications after TKA, encompassing both medical and surgical complications. Specifically, patients who have MFS have a significantly higher likelihood of experiencing prosthetic instability and requiring revision surgery. Given these results, it is crucial for orthopedic surgeons and patients alike to consider these risks when determining a course of TKA for patients who have MFS."

    "abstract": "Introduction Acute aortic dissection (AAD) represents a significant diagnostic challenge with a high mortality rate if not treated promptly. This challenge arises from the diverse clinical presentations of AAD, and its symptom overlap with other medical conditions. Although both helical CT and transesophageal echocardiography are reliable diagnostic tools for AAD, they are not feasible for every suspected case. Furthermore, limited research on D-dimer's utility in ruling out AAD has been conducted due to the condition's rarity. Methods This study utilizes the TriNetX database (https://trinetx.com/), encompassing data from 54 healthcare organizations across the United States over the past two decades from 85 million patients. The objective is to evaluate the sensitivity of an elevated D-dimer level in diagnosing AAD across a much larger patient cohort than previously studied. Results Retrospectively analyzing this dataset, there were 1,319 patients identified with a confirmed AAD who had undergone D-dimer testing within a day of diagnosis. Of these, 1,252 patients exhibited D-dimer levels exceeding 400 ng/ml while 1,227 had levels surpassing 500 ng/ml. Notably, a D-dimer cutoff of 400 ng/ml demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.949 while a 500 ng/ml cutoff yielded a sensitivity of 0.930. Conclusion This large retrospective cohort study demonstrates that a blood D-dimer level is highly sensitive in assaying for AAD. The D-dimer levels analyzed showed a remarkable sensitivity in ruling out AAD, avoiding the need for more invasive testing in low-risk patients."

There are various strategies for dissection involving the left subclavian artery, but limited by the variety and cost of stents, the treatment brings certain obstacles. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the wire-guided prefenestration technique for treating left subclavian artery involvement in patients with arterial dissection. A 48-year-old man was transferred to our hospital due to persistent chest and back pain that had lasted for 6 hours. Preoperative computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the thoracic and abdominal aorta diagnosed with ABAD that affected his left subclavian artery, who needed emergency endovascular treatment due to malperfusion of the lower limb arteries. To perform the procedure, a guide wire was inserted through the left brachial artery, exited through the right femoral artery, and then entered the pre-fenestrated hole leading to the main stent. The stent was released while the guide wire was in position, and the left subclavian artery was reconstructed using viabahn. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair was successfully completed for ABAD. A follow-up CT angiogram of the thoracic and abdominal aorta revealed positive vascular remodeling and no signs of significant internal leakage after one month. This innovative approach offers a secure and efficient treatment option for aortic dissection in individuals who have undergone left subclavian artery reconstruction."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) is a critical emergency in cardiovascular disease. AD occurs only in specific sites of the aorta, and the variation of shear stress in different aortic segments is a possible cause not reported. This study investigated the key molecules involved in shear stress-induced AD through quantitative bioinformatic analysis of a public RNA sequencing database and clinical tissue sample validation. Gene expression data from the GSE153434, GSE147026, and GSE52093 datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Next, differently expressed genes (DEGs) in each dataset were identified and integrated to identify common AD DEGs. STRING, Cytoscape, and MCODE were used to identify hub genes and crucial clustering modules, and Connectivity Map (CMap) was used to identify positive and negative agents. The same procedure was performed for the GSE160611 dataset to obtain shear stress-induced human aortic endothelial cell (HAEC) DEGs. After the integration of these two DEGs sets to identify shear stress-associated hub DEGs in AD, Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis was performed. The common chemokine receptors and ligands in AD were identified by analyzing AD's three RNA sequencing datasets. Their origin was verified by analyzing AD single-cell sequencing data and validated by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. We identified 100 down-regulated and 50 up-regulated AD common DEGs. Enrichment results showed that common DEGs were closely related to blood vessel morphogenesis, muscle structure development, muscle tissue development, and chemotaxis. Among those DEGs, MYC, CCL2, and SPP1 are the three molecules with the highest degree. A crucial cluster of 15 genes was identified using MCODE, which contained inflammation-related genes with elevated expression and muscle cell-related genes with decreased expression, and CCL2 is central to immune-related genes. CMap confirmed MEK inhibitors and ALK inhibitors as possible therapeutic agents for AD. Moreover, 366 shear stress-associated DEGs in HAEC were identified in the GSE160611 dataset. After taking the intersection, we identified five shear stress-associated hub DEGs in AD (ANGPTL4, SNAI2, CCL2, GADD45B, and PROM1), and the enrichment analysis indicated they were related to the endothelial cell apoptotic process. Chemokine CCL2 was the molecule with a high degree in both DEG sets. Besides CCL2, CXCL5 was the only chemokine ligand differentially expressed in the three datasets. Additionally, immunoblotting confirmed the increased expression of CCL2 and CXCL5 in clinical tissue samples. Further research at the single-cell level revealed that CCL2 has multiple origins, and CXCL5 is macrophage-derived. Through integrative analysis, we identified core common AD DEGs and possible therapeutic agents based on these DEGs. We elucidated that the chemokine CCL2 and CXCL5-mediated \"Endothelial-Monocyte-Neutrophil\" axis may contribute to the development of shear stress-induced AD. These findings provide possible therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of AD."

Male-female differences have been observed in cardiovascular disease; however, literature on type B aortic dissection is scarce. A retrospective cohort study was conducted including all consecutive patients with acute type B aortic dissection between 2007 and 2017 in 4 tertiary hospitals using patient files and questionnaires for late morbidity. In total, 384 patients were included with a follow-up of 6.1 (range, 0.02-14.8) years, of which 41% (n=156) were female. Women presented at an older age than men (67 [interquartile range (IQR), 57-73] versus 62 [IQR, 52-71]; P=0.015). Prior abdominal aortic aneurysm (6% versus 15%; P=0.009), distally extending dissections (71 versus 85%; P=0.001), and clinical malperfusion (18% versus 32%; P=0.002) were less frequently observed in women. Absolute maximal descending aortic diameters were smaller in women (36 [IQR: 33-40] mm versus 39 [IQR, 36-43] mm; P<0.001), while indexed for body surface area diameters were larger in women (20 [IQR, 18-23] mm/m2 versus 19 [IQR, 17-21] mm/m2). No male-female differences were found in treatment choice; however, indications for invasive treatment were different (P<0.001). Early mortality rate was 9.6% in women and 11.8% in men (P=0.60). The 5-year survival was 83% (95% CI, 77-89) for women and 84% (95% CI, 79-89) for men (P=0.90). No male-female differences were observed in late (re)interventions. No male-female differences were found in management, early or late death, and morbidity in patients presenting with acute type B aortic dissection, despite distinct clinical profiles at presentation. More details on the impact of age and type of intervention are warranted in future studies."

    "abstract": "A 34-year-old uncontrolled hypertensive male presented with chest pain radiating to the back. Despite severe pain, he was persistently bradycardic at 38 beats per minute. The workup at the emergency department confirmed the presence of an acute Stanford B aortic dissection. Stanford B dissections are not usually associated with bradycardia. It is Stanford A dissections that are mostly linked with bradycardia because Stanford A dissections can cause concomitant coronary artery extension and involvement of the atrioventricular node. This case demonstrates that sinus bradycardia can exist in the acute setting of any painful aortic dissection, even though it might not necessarily involve the coronary arteries."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate cardiovascular function in a patient with high-flow arteriovenous fistula (AVF) who underwent aortic dissection (AD) using four-dimensional (4D) flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as analyze the effect of flow reduction surgery on AD. On March 12, 2017, a 60-year-old woman underwent emergency surgery for AD. After that, she experienced acute kidney injury, and hemodialysis was initiated. On April 24, 2017, a left brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) was created to facilitate her dialysis. However, after 5 years, the patient presented with a high-flow AVF, and a flow reduction surgery was performed on March 11, 2022. To evaluate the procedure's effectiveness, we measured the changes in left ventricular (LV) function and blood flow in the aorta and vascular access before and after surgery using 4D flow MRI. Notable changes were observed in LV function, blood flow in the aorta before and after the surgery, and maximum velocity and flow volume after surgery. During the 6-month follow-up after the surgery, the maximum velocity and flow volume in the aorta and vascular access were reduced; also, indicators such as LV volume, cardiac output, cardiac index, and LV mass were improved. In patients with high-flow AVF, flow reduction surgery should be considered as it may improve LV function and reduce the risk of AD recurrence by lowering the flow volume of the aorta."

    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic aneurysm dissection (TAAD) represents a cardiac surgery emergency characterized by the disrupted integrity of the aortic wall and is associated with poor prognosis. In this context, the identification of biomarkers implicated in the pathobiology of TAAD is crucial. Our aim in the present original in silico study is to assess the differential gene expression profile of the tight junction proteins (TJPs) in patients with TAAD and to propose novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of this disease. We implemented bioinformatics methodology in order to construct the gene network of the TJPs family, identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in pathologic aortic tissue excised from patients with TAAD as compared to healthy aortic tissue, and assess the related biological functions and the associated miRNA families. Data regarding the transcriptomic profile of selected genes were retrieved and incorporated from three microarray datasets, including 23 TAAD and 20 healthy control samples. A total of 32 TJPs were assessed. The zona occludens 2 (ZO-2) protein encoded by the gene TJP2 was significantly under-expressed in patients with TAAD compared to the control group (p = 0.009). ZO-2 was associated with fair discrimination and calibration traits in predicting the TAAD presentation. CpG islands of ZO-2 were demonstrated. No important difference was found regarding ZO-2 expression between aneurysmal non-dissected and healthy control aortic tissue. Finally, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and uncovered the major biological functions and miRNA families (hsa-miR-155-5p, hsa-miR-1-3p, hsa-miR-2118-5p, hsa-miR-4691-3p, and hsa-miR-1229-3p) relevant to ZO-2. These outcomes demonstrated the important role of ZO-2 in the pathobiology of TAAD."

    "abstract": "The introduction of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has undeniably changed the landscape of valvular heart disease management over the last two decades. A reduction in complications through improvements in techniques, experience, and technology has established TAVR as a safe and effective alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement. However, it is important to consider the potential risks associated with TAVR and ways in which life-threatening complications can be identified and managed in a timely fashion. In this article, we review some catastrophic iatrogenic aortic injuries that are described in the literature and present a case of an acute iatrogenic type A aortic dissection that occurred during a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). After valve deployment, a routine neurologic examination noted the new onset of a left-sided facial droop and upper extremity weakness. Urgent imaging revealed an extensive type A aortic dissection, and the patient was taken to the operating room for surgical repair. The coordination of our multidisciplinary team allowed for prompt recognition of her neurologic symptoms, urgent imaging, and timely transport to the operating room, all of which contributed to the successful management of this life-threatening procedural complication."

Extension of an aortic dissection can cause destabilization of the previously implanted stent graft, thrombosis of the stent graft, and rupture of the aneurysmal sac, with high mortality without therapy. This report describes the case of a 66-year-old patient complaining of sudden abdominal pain radiating to both flanks. Computed tomography angiography of the aorta revealed acute type B aortic dissection with infrarenal rupture of the false lumen after endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair 5 years prior. The patient underwent infrarenal open surgical conversion with suprarenal aortic clamping and implantation of a bifurcated Dacron graft. Postoperatively, no serious complications resulted from the treatment, except for fascial dehiscence. In such cases, the patients can be treated in an emergency situation with open repair, despite the high risk of complications and mortality."

Whole-body computed tomography (CT) revealed grade II aortic injury with disrupted blood flow to the left kidney. Sudden paralysis of the left lower extremity and distal progression of the aortic dissection occurred. However, TEVAR could not be performed immediately. Therefore, an external shunt from the right common femoral artery to the left lower extremity was created with angioplasty, superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenting, and celiac artery (CA) balloon dilatation. The patient's condition stabilized, and he was transferred to a hospital where TEVAR was performed. Selective arterial catheterization (SAC) for treating intraperitoneal organ malperfusion caused by BTAI may be an effective bridging therapy for TEVAR."

Especially in Japan, the number of surgeries for acute type A aortic dissection has been gradually increasing recently, and the overall mortality rate has stabilized at less than 10%. One of the keys to further improvement in outcomes will be to improve the results of aortic root replacement. In addition, strategies need to be established for very elderly patients, comatose patients, and patients with malperfusion as preoperative conditions. The use of a relatively new device, the frozen elephant trunk, is also increasing and might be changing the surgical outcome.

This review is based on the current literature and includes the results from the Aortic Registry of National Heart Institute of Malaysia (NHIM) database. It covers different aspects of ATAAD and concentrates on the outcome of surgical repair. The diagnosis is often delayed leading to variable outcomes. High index of suspicion and urgent treatment is required to tackle this dynamic disease which include the variation in presentation and clinical course. Different surgical techniques and perfusion strategies have been described to save patients. Complex techniques such as total arch replacement (TAR) with frozen elephant trunk and valve sparing root surgery may provide long-term benefit in selected patients, but require significant surgical expertise and experience."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition that requires urgent surgical treatment. The frozen elephant trunk (FET) technique, including the Thoraflex hybrid prosthesis, has emerged as an effective strategy for treating complex aortic pathologies. With the widespread application of the FET technique, it continues to evolve, aiming to simplify procedures and reduce complications. These advancements provide improved outcomes and help save lives in patients with acute aortic dissection. For this review, PubMed databases were utilized from inception to March 2023. A descriptive approach was employed to identify and present the evidence regarding the application of the FET technique in acute settings and its clinical implications on the postoperative course. In the reviewed studies, FET was a commonly used treatment approach for acute type A aortic dissection. A comprehensive analysis of 12 studies, comprising over 4056 FET procedures, revealed varying rates of early mortality (up to 21.1%), perioperative stroke (ranging from 2.7 to 18.0%), and spinal cord ischemia (ranging from 0 to 8.2%). During the follow-up period, which ranged from 6 to 108 months, the mortality rate was reported to be as high as 38%. The surgical management of acute aortic dissection remains challenging, but FET has shown promising results. Experienced teams have achieved acceptable in-hospital mortality and stroke rates, along with a lower risk of spinal cord injury compared to conventional repair. Furthermore, the FET technique has demonstrated positive alterations in the structure of the distal aorta, potentially improving long-term survival and reducing the necessity for future procedures."

Though the entity is associated with high mortality and morbidity, with well-executed and timely surgical intervention, mortality and morbidity could be reduced to a reasonable extent. Information about demographics, clinical pattern, and results of management of acute TAAD from the Indian subcontinent largely remains unpublished. There are only a few specialized centers performing aortic operations. Very often, the patients with acute TAAD are operated on by surgeons with limited experience and resources. The surgeon is operating like a \"lone warrior\" without the support of a specialized radiologist, interventionalist, and specialized anesthetist. In most of the hospitals, facilities for sophisticated monitoring, sealants, specialized grafts, and stent graft are not available. We follow a simple algorithm of diagnosis and surgical management. The goal of treatment is to save the life. We follow a conservative approach best suited to our circumstances. Mild hypothermia, carotid cannulation, and antegrade cerebral perfusion as cerebral protection strategies have yielded satisfactory results. In case of organ malperfusion, with some exceptions, we perform aortic repair first. Our policy, towards arch management is less aggressive. In high-risk cases, we perform an endovascular-compliant hemiarch or arch replacement, followed by stent grafting in the post-operative period."

Over time, as surgical techniques and strategies have improved, these improvements have benefitted female patients. Using a multicenter national aortic registry from the Canadian Thoracic Aortic Collaborative (CTAC), we aimed to determine the relationship between sex and outcomes following aortic arch repair and to examine how these have changed over time. The multicenter prospective CTAC database of all aortic procedures performed under circulatory arrest from participating centers across Canada (n=9) was used. Patients were included who underwent elective or urgent/emergency arch reconstruction under circulatory arrest from 2002 to 2021. The primary composite endpoint was defined as the occurrence of one of the following endpoints: in-hospital mortality, stroke, dialysis-dependent renal failure, deep sternal wound infection, reoperation, or prolonged ventilation of >40 hours. Secondary endpoints included in-hospital mortality, in-hospital stroke, and a modified version of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons-defined composite endpoint for mortality and major morbidity (MMOM). A total of 2,592 patients who underwent aortic arch repair between 2002 and 2021 (31.4% female and 68.6% male patients). Operative mortality decreased through the study period for female patients. No change in operative mortality was observed in male patients or following elective repair. The composite endpoint improved for female patients over time in both elective and urgent surgery, while for male patients, rates improved for elective surgery and remained stable for urgent. Ultimately, female sex was not an independent predictor of adverse outcomes following aortic arch repair. Our results are congruent with existing data and are highly encouraging. It shows that multilevel improvements in our approach to aortic arch surgery have helped to serve female patients who were previously disadvantaged."

IMH represents 5-30% of all AAS and 60-70% of cases are located in the descending aorta. The diagnosis relies on a high index of clinical suspicion and on the use of complementary images. Management is conservative, but patients with some high-risk characteristics have a higher risk of mortality in the acute phase, so initial endovascular management should be considered. We present the case of a 69-year-old patient, in whom IMH was diagnosed in the course of a hypertensive emergency and who required hybrid management due to high-risk anatomical characteristics for endovascular management only.

A 53-year-old man presented to the emergency department with forgetfulness. Based on the concept that \"time is brain,\" stroke was initially considered in the differential diagnosis. The patient underwent emergency coronary angiography and was diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction. After contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography, the patient was finally diagnosed with AAD. Because valuable time was lost in diagnosis rather than treatment, optimal timing for surgery missed. The patient died following an aortic dissection rupture while waiting for emergency surgery. When forgetfulness cannot be completely accounted for in patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction, AAD should be considered.

Consensus on the key aspects of interhospital transfer of patients with AAS was established using the Delphi method, in line with Conducting and Reporting of Delphi Studies guidelines. A national patient charity for aortic dissection was involved in the design of the Delphi study. Vascular and cardiothoracic surgeons, emergency physicians, interventional radiologists, cardiologists, intensivists and anaesthetists in the United Kingdom were invited to participate via their respective professional societies. Three consecutive rounds of an electronic Delphi survey were completed by 212, 101 and 58 respondents, respectively. Using predefined consensus criteria, 60 out of 117 (51%) statements from the survey were included in the consensus statement. The study concluded that patients can be taken directly to a specialist aortic centre if they have typical symptoms of AAS on the background of known aortic disease or previous aortic intervention. Accepted patients should be transferred in a category 2 ambulance (response time <18 min), ideally accompanied by transfer-trained personnel or Adult Critical Care Transfer Services. A clear plan should be agreed in case of a cardiac arrest occurring during the transfer. Patients should reach the aortic centre within 4 hours of the initial referral from their local hospital. This consensus statement is the first set of national interdisciplinary recommendations on the interhospital transfer of patients with AAS. Its implementation is likely to contribute to safer and more standardised emergency referral pathways to regional high-volume specialist aortic units."

All consecutive patients with a pathological aortic arch who underwent aortic repair combined with homemade single-fenestrated stent-graft from 2015 to 2020 were reviewed. The patients with a target vessel different from the left subclavian artery (LSA) were excluded. A total of 63 patients were treated for a pathological arch in zone 2 with a single-fenestrated PMEG. 73% were male, and the mean age was 65 years old. 25% were treated for a degenerative aneurysm, 19% for a post dissection aneurysm and 24% for an acute type B dissection. 52% of the patients were treated as an emergency and half of those for an aortic rupture. The LSA fenestration was stented in 70%. During 30 days of follow-up, 2 strokes (3%) were reported, 6 patients (10%) died with 4 of those treated for aortic rupture and 1 had a retrograde aortic dissection. During at least 3 years of follow-up (median 49 months), no reintervention was needed for endoleaks, there was no stent fracture or stent migration. No patient died from an aortic cause. Subgroup analysis comparing the endovascular treatment for various aortic pathologies did not find significant differences in death rate or comorbidity including stroke. When comparing emergent and elective aortic repair, operating time was similar (64 vs 65 minutes), and the LSA fenestration was less frequently stented (52%) in the emergency group. There was no difference in stroke frequency. There was a higher rate of death in the emergency group at 30 days of follow-up, but no patient died from aortic cause in the long-term follow-up. Aortic arch repair with single-fenestrated PMEGs for zone 2 pathological arch disease is associated with acceptable early and midterm major morbidity and mortality. It is suitable for emergency situations.Clinical ImpactSingle-fenestrated PMEG for the left subclavian artery is a safe and efficient option in the short and medium term for the treatment of the aortic arch in zone 2 with 98% technical success. It allows for aortic repair and subclavian artery revascularization in a single step for all patients. It is suitable for a range of main pathologies, including degenerative, dissection-related, isthmus rupture, and embolic pathologies. Additionally, it is always available and easily utilized in emergency cases."

The study objective was to determine the test characteristics of this protocol. This was an institutional review board-approved, multicenter, prospective, observational, cohort study of a convenience sample of adult patients. Patients suspected of having an AoD received a TTE and abdominal aorta POCUS. Three sonographic signs suggested AoD: a pericardial effusion, an intimal flap, or an aortic outflow track diameter measuring more than 35 mm. Investigators present continuous and categorical data as medians with interquartile ranges or proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and utilized standard 2 × 2 tables on MedCalc (Version 19.1.6) to calculate test characteristics with 95% CI. Investigators performed 1314 POCUS examinations, diagnosing 21 Stanford type A and 23 Stanford type B AoD. Forty-one of the 44 cases had at least one of the aforementioned sonographic findings.

Our aim was to create a new tool for distinguishing UAAS by using multiple modalities to select patients for CT aortography. This study included 75 patients with UAAS, 77 with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and 81 with heart failure (HF) who received urgent treatment after propensity matching. Specific symptoms, past medical history, mediastinal width, region of interest (ROI) ratio in the lung base/apex, D-dimers, and troponin I were investigated to differentiate UAAS from ACS and HF. The most significant variables were selected to create a new scoring system. The UAAS score exhibited a performance AUC of 0.982. A simple UAAS score >1, excluding ROI ratios in lung base/apex, showed an AUC of 0.977, a sensitivity of 96%, and specificity of 92.41%. The results were validated using an external data set of 292 patients (simple UAAS score > 1: AUC of 0.966, sensitivity 93.33%, and specificity 95.36%). The simple UAAS score may be a valuable tool for suspecting UAAS and may reduce the likelihood of misdiagnosis or performing unnecessary CT aortography."

    "title": "Operative Repair of Type A Aortic Dissection in Jehovah's Witnesses: Insights From a Case Series.",
    "abstract": "Jehovah's Witnesses are known to refuse allogeneic blood products. Consequently, many surgeons will decline to perform aortic surgery on this patient group, given their higher risk. We present here a case series describing operative repair of type A aortic dissection without the use of allogeneic blood products. From 2018 to 2021, 6 Jehovah's Witness patients underwent open repair of type A aortic dissection. We reviewed preoperative characteristics, diagnostic workup, operative technique, and postoperative outcomes. We also looked specifically at use of autologous whole blood, Cell Saver (Haemonetics) transfusion, synthetic clotting factors (recombinant factor VIIa), and albumin and prothrombin complex concentrate when allowed. Modified hemiarch replacement was performed with the branched single-anastomosis frozen elephant trunk repair (B-SAFER) technique in 4 patients; 2 patients received a standard hemiarch replacement. Aortic valve replacement was performed in 2 patients; root replacement was performed in 1 patient. There were no immediate postoperative coronary complications, strokes, or instances of renal failure. Average decrease in hemoglobin concentration after surgery was 2.3 ± 1.5 g/dL (mean ± SD). Thirty-day mortality was 0. Five of 6 patients survived to discharge, and all survivors to discharge were still alive at the time of submission. Bloodless aortic dissection repair in these rare patients can be performed safely in specialized centers using the techniques described. Furthermore, we believe that these techniques can be applied to the general population of patients undergoing emergent cardiac operation to avoid allogeneic transfusions."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection is associated with high perioperative morbidity and mortality. Ascyrus Medical Dissection Stent (Cryolife, Kennesaw, USA) is a novel uncovered hybrid stent graft developed to be used as an adjunct to standard surgical approach to promote true lumen expansion and enhance aortic remodeling. From March 2021 to March 2022, four consecutive patients presented with acute Debakey type I aortic dissection and underwent emergent surgical repair with Tirone David procedure and implantation of Ascyrus Medical Dissection Stent. We reviewed patient's files retrospectively and described the perioperative outcomes. All four device implantations were successful. Overall 30-day mortality was 0%. Malperfusion that was present in two patients pre-operatively improved after Ascyrus Medical Dissection Stent implantation. No aortic reinterventions were needed. No aortic injury related to the device was noted. Favourable changes in aortic true lumen and false lumen dimensions were found in most of our patients but the stent was compressed at the isthmus in one patient. Ascyrus Medical Dissection Stent is a reliable and secure device. However, its benefits remain unclear when it comes to a positive remodeling and seems less likelihood comparable to a frozen elephant trunk. The main reason seems to be an insufficient radial force of the stent."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the relationship between false lumen morphology and the size, aortic segment and position of the entry tear for acute type A aortic dissection. The records of patients who underwent emergency operation for acute type A aortic dissection in our institution between April 2011 and May 2022 were examined. Data regarding size, location and position of the entry tear and preoperative computed tomography findings were reviewed. The relationship of these variables with false lumen morphology was examined and retrospectively compared according to tear size. Of 243 cases, characteristics of the entry tear, visualized during surgery, were confirmed in 134 cases (age = 70.9 ± 12.6 years, male = 45.5%). Tear sizes at different aortic segments were not significantly different (P = 0.376). Tears posterior to the lesser curvature were significantly smaller than those anterior to the greater curvature (P = 0.004). A thrombosed false lumen was associated with a significantly smaller tear size and position on the posterior to the lesser curvature side in aortic cross-section (all P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that tear size, the presence of re-entry and tear position anterior to the greater curvature were independent predictors of a patent false lumen. In acute type A aortic dissection, larger tear size, the presence of re-entry and tear position anterior to the greater curvature are risk factors for a patent false lumen. Although the results of this study are valid only for patients in whom intimal tears were detected during aortic surgery, this trend may provide information for pathophysiology of the disease."

    "abstract": "Aortoesophageal fistula (AEF) is a rare but typically life-threatening condition. Although several treatment strategies exist, including conservative treatment with intraluminal stent graft and open thoracic aortic replacement, the overall outcome remains poor, ranging from 16 to 39%. Furthermore, esophageal reconstruction methods vary between hospitals. Herein, we report a case of aortoesophageal fistula treated using one-stage total reconstruction. This case involved a 58-year-old woman who developed acute type A aortic dissection and underwent successful total arch replacement at the other hospital. However, she developed AEF 1 year later and underwent urgent thoracic endovascular aortic repair, which eventually failed. We performed thoracic aortic replacement, total esophagectomy, gastric tube reconstruction, and omental flap in a one-stage operation. The patient was extubated the next day and transferred to the general ward on postoperative day 3. Computed tomography revealed favorable results. For postoperative AEF, dedicated debridement with reconstruction is more effective than conservative treatment. In an experienced center, post-procedure-related AEF can be easily treated using one-stage reconstruction."

However, multiple candidate pathways were reported though which PKD1 regulates AD in previous study, a comprehensive insight is still absent. In this study, we compared the AD and normal samples in transcriptome scale, and detected 717 PKD1-related differential expressed genes, which enriched in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction (AD tissue preference) and VSMC contraction pathway (normal tissue preference). Furthermore, we also found two important functional hub genes in PKD1 regulation, JUN and ACTN2, and established a carnal-miRNA-mRNA network. Our study demonstrated the co-regulation of muscle development and signal transduction in AD's progression, and also provided the genetic basis for the following mechanism research with AD."

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of acute aortic syndrome (AAS) is commonly delayed or missed in the ED. We describe characteristics of ED attendances with symptoms potentially associated with AAS, diagnostic performance of clinical decision tools (CDTs) and physicians and yield of CT aorta angiogram (CTA). This was a multicentre observational cohort study of adults attending 27 UK EDs between 26 September 2022 and 30 November 2022, with potential AAS symptoms: chest, back or abdominal pain, syncope or symptoms related to malperfusion. Patients were preferably identified prospectively, but retrospective recruitment was also permitted. Anonymised, routinely collected patient data including components of CDTs, was abstracted. Clinicians treating prospectively identified patients were asked to record their perceived likelihood of AAS, prior to any confirmatory testing. Reference standard was radiological or operative confirmation of AAS. 30-day electronic patient record follow-up evaluated whether a subsequent diagnosis of AAS had been made and mortality. 5548 patients presented, with a median age of 55 years (IQR 37-72; n=5539). 14 (0.3%; n=5353) had confirmed AAS. 10/1046 (1.0%) patients in whom the ED clinician thought AAS was possible had AAS. 5/147 (3.4%) patients in whom AAS was considered the most likely diagnosis had AAS. 2/3319 (0.06%) patients in whom AAS was considered not possible did have AAS. 540 (10%; n=5446) patients underwent CT, of which 407 were CTA (7%). 30-day follow-up did not reveal any missed AAS diagnoses. AUROC (area under the receiver operating characteristic) curve for ED clinician AAS likelihood rating was 0.958 (95% CI 0.933 to 0.983, n=4006) and for individual CDTs were: Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score (ADD-RS) 0.674 (95% CI 0.508 to 0.839, n=4989), AORTAs 0.689 (95% CI 0.527 to 0.852, n=5132), Canadian 0.818 (95% CI 0.686 to 0.951, n=5180) and Sheffield 0.628 (95% CI 0.467 to 0.788, n=5092). Only 0.3% of patients presenting with potential AAS symptoms had AAS but 7% underwent CTA. CDTs incorporating clinician gestalt appear to be most promising, but further prospective work is needed, including evaluation of the role of D-dimer. NCT05582967; NCT05582967."

    "title": "Acute Aortic Dissection Type A in Younger Patients (< 60 Years Old) - Does Full Arch Replacement Provide Benefits Compared to Limited Approach?",
    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection Stanford type A (AADA) is a surgical emergency associated with high morbidity and mortality. Although surgical management has improved, the optimal therapy is a matter of debate. Different surgical strategies have been proposed for patients under 60 years old. This paper evaluates the postoperative outcome and the need for secondary aortic operation after a limited surgical approach (proximal arch replacement) vs. extended arch repair. Between January 2000 and January 2018, 530 patients received surgical treatment for AADA at our hospital; 182 were under 60 years old and were enrolled in this study - Group A (n=68), limited arch repair (proximal arch replacement), and group B (n=114), extended arch repair (> proximal arch replacement). More pericardial tamponade (P=0.005) and preoperative mechanical resuscitation (P=0.014) were seen in Group A. More need for renal replacement therapy (P=0.047) was seen in the full arch group. Mechanical ventilation time (P=0.022) and intensive care unit stay (P<0.001) were shorter in the limited repair group. Thirty-day mortality was comparable (P=0.117). New onset of postoperative stroke was comparable (Group A four patients [5.9%] vs. Group B 15 patients [13.2%]; P=0.120). Long-term follow-up did not differ significantly for secondary aortic surgery. Even though young patients received only limited arch repair, the outcome was comparable. Full-arch replacement was not beneficial in the long-time follow-up. A limited approach is justified in the cohort of young AADA patients. Exemptions, like known Marfan syndrome and the presence of an intimal tear in the arch, should be considered."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection causes major morbidities and mortalities. The treatment of choice for type A aortic dissection (TAAD) is emergent surgical intervention. However, surgery per se may be associated with significant risk, in part due to the general surgical challenges, and the inherent hemodynamic- and organ malperfusion effects. In particular, surgery correlates with marked perioperative mortality in octo- and nonagenarians and those with severe comorbidities. Conservative medical treatment represents an alternative approach to patients for whom surgery is deemed high-risk, but case literature in this field remains sparse. We present a case of an 86-year-old female admitted with TAAD and deemed inoperable by the cardiothoracic surgical team due to excessive risks. The patient was treated conservatively with an extensive and aggressive antihypertensive regimen, leading to an uneventful recovery. Most cases of TAADs require emergent surgery. However, surgery is often contraindicated in comorbid and older patients due to excessive risks. The patient in this report is unique due to the long follow-up after conservative treatment and the close adherence to treatment protocol due to continuous therapeutic monitoring. It is important to consider factors for and against conservative therapeutic strategies, and, importantly, adherence to such should be carefully monitored to optimize patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) has an unfavorable prognosis. It requires early diagnosis, appropriate treatment strategies, and suspicion to recognize symptoms; thus, it is commonly described as an acute aortic emergency. The clinical manifestations of painless AD are complex and variable. However, there is no effective treatment to prevent the progression of AD. Therefore, study of the molecular targets and mechanisms of AD to enable prevention or early intervention is particularly important. Although multiple gene mutations have been proposed as linked to AD development, evidence that multiple epigenetic elements are strongly associated is steadily increasing. These epigenetic processes include DNA methylation, N6-methyladenosine, histone modification, non-histone posttranslational modification, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Among these processes, resveratrol targeting Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), 5-azacytidine (5azaC) targeting DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), and vitamin C targeting ten-eleven translocation 2 (Tet2) showed unique advantages in improving AD and vascular dysfunction. Finally, we explored potential epigenetic drugs and diagnostic methods for AD, which might provide options for the future."

Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), infrequently used for the ascending aorta, may be considered an alternative in this setting. We describe early results for emergency and compassionate (E&C) use of a novel endograft, specifically designed for use to treat pathology of the ascending aorta. This case series evaluated 19 patients (mean age, 68.84±13.12 years; 57.9% female) treated with ascending TEVAR for acute and chronic acute (4), subacute (1), or chronic (1) aortic dissection or pseudoaneurysm (13). Six of the 19 patients (31.5%) were treated under compassionate use and 13 patients (68.4%) were treated under the emergency use exemption. Ten patients (52.6%) received additional devices to extend treatment into the arch and descending aorta. Device delivery was achieved in all patients (100%). Thirty-day mortality and stroke occurred in 3 patients (15.8%) and in 1 patient (5.3%), respectively. In 1 patient (5.3%), with an Unanticipated Adverse Device Event, the aorta ruptured when the endograft eroded into the adventitial portion of dissection site at the posterior aspect of the ascending wall. Devices were explanted in 2 patients (10.5%), 353 and 610 days after the index procedure, respectively. Six patients had endoleaks (31.6%), including type I (n=2, 10.5%), type II endoleaks (n=3, 15.8%), and indeterminate endoleak (n=1, 5.3%). Delivery and deployment of a novel ascending thoracic stent graft with or without an additional branched arch extension is feasible in patients with complex anatomy and pathology, including acute aortic dissection and pseudoaneurysm. Additional experience with this novel device will further refine the patient population most suitable for endovascular ascending aortic repair for these pathologies.Clinical ImpactThis study describes a novel stent graft specifically designed for treatment of ascending aortic pathology, including acute type A dissection. The patients described in this series constituted a group outside the formal US FDA sponsored clinical trial, and were those accepted as part of an emergency and compassionate use basis."

This study sought to describe the incidence and characteristics of the triple-lumen aortic dissection and its impact on survival. From 2010 to 2021, a query of a single-institution aortic database identified 1149 patients with chronic distal aortic dissection. Thirty-three (2.9%) patients with at least 3 distinct lumens and 2 separate \"primary\" intimal tears were identified by analysis of contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging. Triple-lumen patients were exactly matched with a cohort of double-lumen patients on a 1:1 ratio using 5 preoperative variables, and outcomes between the groups were assessed. The median age at time of initial dissection in patients with a triple-lumen dissection was 46 years. Initial dissection was a type A in 33% and a type B in 67% of patients. The median time from initial dissection to triple-lumen diagnosis was 4.2 years. On diagnosis of the triple-lumen aorta, 85% of patients required urgent aortic repair for rapid growth (36%), aortic diameter ≥55 mm (30%), malperfusion (6%), intractable pain (6%), and rupture/type A (6%). Thirty-day mortality after triple lumen dissection was 12%. Acute-on-chronic distal dissection resulting in a triple-lumen aorta should be classified as a \"complicated\" type B dissection as these patients typically have large aneurysms and a high incidence of rapid false lumen expansion requiring urgent surgical repair."

    "abstract": "Nicardipine is commonly used in the management of hypertensive crises, except those involving cardiac contractility defects despite its ability to reduce afterload and pulmonary congestion. Consequently, there is limited literature evaluating nicardipine's role for this indication. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nicardipine in adults with reduced ejection fractions presenting with acute heart failure with hypertension (AHF-H). This was a retrospective study conducted at an academic Level 1 trauma center with an annual Emergency Department (ED) volume surpassing 100,000. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of nicardipine in adults with reduced ejection fractions presenting to the ED with AHF-H. Efficacy was determined by achievement of the physician prescribed blood pressure target range. The primary safety endpoints included the number of individuals who experienced bradycardia (< 60 beats per minute, bpm) or hypotension (systolic blood pressure, SBP, < 90 mmHg) while receiving nicardipine and for up to 15 min after its discontinuation. Patients were included if they were ≥ 18 years of age, received a continuous intravenous nicardipine infusion within six hours of presenting to the ED, and had an ejection fraction ≤ 40% per an echocardiogram obtained within three months of the study visit. Pregnant and incarcerated patients were excluded. Of the 500 patient charts reviewed, 38 met inclusion criteria. The median (interquartile, IQR) ejection fraction and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were 35% (25-40) and 731 pg/nL (418-3277), respectively. The median baseline heart rate and SBP were 90 bpm and 193 mmHg, respectively. The median physician specified SBP goal was 160 mmHg and all patients met this endpoint in a median time of 18 min. One (2.6%) patient in the total population developed both hypotension and bradycardia. This patient had an ejection fraction of 20%, was intubated, and received nicardipine in addition to esmolol for an aortic dissection without experiencing an adverse event until 30 min after dexmedetomidine was initiated. In this non-interventional study evaluating the use of nicardipine in patients with reduced ejection fractions presenting to the ED with AHF-H, nicardipine was found to be safe and effective. To our knowledge this is the largest study to date evaluating nicardipine in this patient population and positively contributes to the existing literature."

We collected patients who underwent hybrid total arch replacement (HTAR) via ministernotomy (96) and total arch replacement with frozen elephant trunk (TAR + FET) procedures (99), between 2018 and 2021. The baseline information, intraoperative and postoperative characteristics have been compared. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used for survival evaluation. Cox regression were applied to identify the independent predictor of mortality. The baseline characteristics between the two patient groups were compared and found similar, except that RBC counts were higher (p = 0.038) and the ascending aorta diameter was smaller (P = 0.019) in the \"HTAR\" group relative to the \"TAR + FET\" group. The cardiopulmonary bypass time (P < 0.001), the aortic cross clamp time (P < 0.001), the operation duration (P = .029), ICU (P = 0.037) and postoperative hospital stay (P = 0.002) were shorter in the \"HTAR\" group. The \"HTAR\" group exhibited also significantly lower levels of intraoperative transfusion (all <0.001) characteristics than the \"TAR + FET\" group.

This study aimed to evaluate the early outcomes of the TBSG technique in older patients with ATAAD. From February 2015 to December 2020, 640 patients who simultaneously underwent an emergent open aortic surgery and TBSG implantation for ATAAD were enrolled in this study. They were categorized into the younger (age ≤ 70 years old, n = 573) and older groups (age > 70 years, n = 67). Clinical data of all patients were retrospectively reviewed. The mean ages of the patients in the younger and older groups were 45.3 ± 9.6 years old and 73.5 ± 3.0 years old, respectively. Preoperative characteristics were similar between the two groups, except for weight and incidence of moderate or greater aortic regurgitation, which were lower in the older group than those in the younger group. Surgical procedure and duration (i.e., duration for cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic cross-clamp, selected cerebral perfusion, and total circulation arrest) were comparable between the two groups (p > 0.05). Patients in the older group had higher incidence of dialysis for acute kidney injury and longer ICU stay compared with those in the younger group. However, the incidences of 30-day mortality (5.1% in younger group vs. 7.5% in older group, p = 0.407) and other major complications (i.e., neurological adverse events) were similar between the two groups. TBSG implantation for ATAAD resulted in an acceptable mortality rate in patients above 70 years old, thus, it could be a feasible surgical procedure to perform in older patients with ATAAD when a TAR is required."

A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted between March 1, 2021, and February 28, 2022. Patients with ATAAD undergoing emergent total arch replacement surgery were divided into the control (CON) and HA groups on the basis of the addition of the HA-380 cartridge in the CPB circuit. Overall, 121 patients met the eligibility criteria; 2 patients in each group who died within the first postoperative week were excluded. Further, 57 and 60 patients in the CON and HA groups, respectively, were included in the pooled analysis. The major perioperative data, baseline values of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein, and therapeutic interventions were similar in the two groups (all, p &gt; 0.05). The serum IL-6 levels increased more rapidly in the CON group than those in the HA group postoperatively (205.73 ± 174.72 vs. 146.13 ± 64.15 pg/mL, p = 0.020). The HA group had a lower incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome than the CON group (25.4 vs. 44.6%, p = 0.032 and 18.3 vs. 35.1%, p = 0.040, respectively). Logistic regression analyses showed that HA may be a protective factor against postoperative AKI. The incidence of bleeding, delirium, and stroke as well as the lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stay in both groups were similar (all, p &gt; 0.05). The use of HA-380 in the CPB circuit may attenuate inflammatory response and reduce major complications following ATAAD surgery. HA may be associated with lower rate of postoperative AKI."

A short custom-made device (CMD) fenestrated graft was predesigned with a single preloaded 8 mm strut-free fenestration at 12 o'clock position. A modified preloaded system was used to allow unilateral access from the distal port if necessary. After bilateral percutaneous femoral access, the graft was deployed under fusion guidance with the CMD fenestration matching the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) origin and immediately bridged as per standard technique. The aneurysm was then excluded with a bifurcated device. A large steerable sheath was used to allow for sequential antegrade laser in situ fenestration and stenting of the renal arteries. Single-vessel customized short fenestrated grafts for the SMA and antegrade in situ laser renal fenestrations are technically feasible for repair of acute complex AAAs even after previous infrarenal reconstruction. It could become an off-the-shelf solution to limit aortic coverage and reno-visceral ischemia, even in patients with a narrow aortic diameter at the renal level.Clinical ImpactSingle-vessel precustomized short fenestrated grafts for the SMA combined with renal artery antegrade ISLF can be a feasible option for the acute repair of patients with complex aneurysms and a narrow aortic diameter at the reno-visceral segment.

(2) Methods: An anonymized, Dutch language, web-based survey was sent out to all of the participants of the 2022 Annual Meeting of the Dutch National Aortic Dissection (DNAD) advocacy group via their own representatives. The survey was divided into five sections: patient information, global satisfaction, surgery, including complications, and the recovery period. (3) Results: Ninety members of the DNAD group attended the meeting. Seventy-five (83%) participated in the survey, and the responses from 61 (81%) were available for analysis. Despite hindrances in their daily life (complications, changes in physical, cognitive, and social functioning), patients were satisfied with their treatment, and all would undergo the procedure again. In addition they requested better post-discharge guidance and communication (4) Conclusion: The emphasis lies in equipping patients with knowledge about potential outcomes and effective coping strategies. This underscores the importance of communication and expectation management, in line with established literature."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) with persistent coma is a life-threatening condition associated with high mortality and poor neurological outcomes. The optimal timing for surgical intervention in these patients remains uncertain, and many patients are not eligible for surgery due to their poor prognosis. In this case, a 53-year-old man with hypertension presented to the emergency department in a coma that had lasted for 9 hours. The patient was diagnosed with ATAAD and underwent the \"Drum Tower Hospital\" strategy, which involved preoperative assessments, including computed tomography angiography (CTA) and quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) monitoring. Surgical interventions, such as emergency stenting and aortic replacement, were performed to restore blood flow and repair the aorta. Postoperative monitoring, including qEEG, showed improvements in brain function. Despite the patient experiencing hemiplegia and a neurological deficit, the \"Drum Tower Hospital\" strategy, guided by comprehensive brain assessments, showed promise in managing ATAAD with coma. However, further research is needed to establish effective treatment strategies for these patients. Overall, ATAAD with persistent coma is a critical condition with limited treatment options. The \"Drum Tower Hospital\" strategy, supported by multimodal brain assessment, offers a potential approach to improve outcomes in these patients."

We highlight the potential utility of non-contrast CT for detection of aortic dissection in a case of a young, immunocompromised man presenting with acute abdominal pain and renal injury. Given elevated creatinine, an initial non-contrast chest CT demonstrated subtle findings suggestive of aortic dissection (aneurysmal dilation of the proximal ascending aorta as well as displaced calcified intimal flap/intraluminal high linear density in the thoracic descending and distal abdominal aorta). Subsequent CT angiography confirmed the presence of an extensive type A aortic dissection. He underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy and hemiarch repair. Displaced calcified intimal flaps, intraluminal high-densities, intramural hematoma, and aneurysmal aortic dilation are common non-contrast computed tomography imaging findings that suggest aortic dissection."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to identify the predictive factors for adverse clinical events after surgery in patients with acute type A aortic dissection (AAAD), and to explore the predictive value of preoperative prognostic nutritional index (PNI) combined with D-dimer for these events. This study was a retrospective analysis of clinical data of 153 patients with AAAD who underwent emergency surgery at our center from January 2019 to January 2022. Patients were divided into adverse event group and non-adverse event group based on whether they experienced adverse clinical events after surgery. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for adverse events, and the predictive efficacy was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). A total of 153 AAAD patients were included in the study, and were divided into the adverse event group (n = 46) and the non-adverse events group (n = 107) based on whether or not they experienced clinical adverse events after surgery. The optimal cutoff value was determined using ROC curves, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. Ultimately, it was found that preoperative PNI < 42.45 and D-dimer > 15.05 were independent predictors of postoperative clinical adverse events in AAAD patients. The odd ratios (OR) value for preoperative PNI < 42.45 is 3.596 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.508-8.923, p = 0.004], while the OR value for D-dimer > 15.05 is 7.572 [95% CI: 3.094-20.220, p < 0.001]. The combination of these two indicators has a high predictive value (AUC = 0.843, 95% CI: 0.774-0.912, p < 0.001) and is superior to using either variable alone. Preoperative PNI < 42.45 and D-dimer > 15.05 are independent predictive factors for postoperative adverse events during hospitalization in patients with AAAD. The combination of these two indicators can improve the predictive accuracy, which is superior to using either variable alone."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the impact of nursing interventions targeting vital signs and complication risk on perioperative outcomes and complications in patients diagnosed with aortic dissection. This retrospective study included patients presenting to our emergency department with acute chest pain as the primary complaint. Inclusion criteria encompassed identifiable chest pain symptoms, documented occurrence time and a time from symptom onset to blood collection of ≤ 24 hours. The cases of aortic dissection were selected from April 2018 to April 2022 and were diagnosed as major arterial dissection based on the Chinese Expert Consensus on the Criteria for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Aortic Dissection. The control group received conventional nursing care for aortic dissection, while the observation group received a nursing plan incorporating vital signs monitoring and addressing complication risk in addition to standard care. All 120 enrolled patients successfully recovered and were discharged from the hospital. Age, body weight, operation time, anesthesia time, preoperative albumin levels, hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) showed no statistically significant differences between the two groups (P > .05). However, 24 hours post-operation, the observation group exhibited significantly lower IL-6 levels compared to the control group (P < .001), with no significant differences in hs-CRP levels (P > .05). Postoperative albumin levels in both aortic dissection groups significantly decreased compared to pre-surgery levels (P < .001) without statistical group differences (P > .05). Compared to controls, the observation group had reduced intraoperative sufentanil dosage, postoperative tracheal catheter extubation time, hospital stay, and costs (P < .001). No anastomotic complications occurred, and edema incidence was lower in the observation group (P = .021), with no significant differences in other complications (P > .05). Nursing interventions improve aortic dissection patient outcomes, reduce complications, and warrant broader clinical use."

    "abstract": "Background Contradictions between management modalities of type A acute aortic dissection (TAAAD) and ST-elevation-myocardial infarction (STEMI) may result in clinical catastrophe. Therefore, we aimed to explore which 2-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) findings are optimal for differentiating TAAAD from STEMI. Methods and Results This study included 340 patients with STEMI and 340 patients with TAAAD who underwent 2DE in the emergency department between 2012 and 2021. The proximal ascending aorta (PAA) diameter and other echocardiographic parameters were analyzed. PAA diameters were measured at 4 levels in the parasternal view: Valsalva, the sinotubular junction (STJ), the PAA at 1 cm above the STJ, and the PAA at 2 cm above the STJ. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis showed that Valsalva, STJ, PAA at 1 cm above the STJ, and PAA at 2 cm above the STJ were significant predictors of TAAAD (areas under the curve: 0.777, 0.924, 0.965, and 0.975, respectively; P<0.001) with the respective cutoff values of 39.4, 38.5, 39.8, and 41.2 mm. Multivariable analysis suggested that all 2DE parameters were significant predictors of TAAAD. Among the 2DE parameters examined, the incorporation of PAA at 2 cm above the STJ to clinical indicators exhibited the most significant diagnostic capability (C-statistics, 0.97; net reclassification improvement, 1.81; integrated discrimination improvement, 0.61). When only TAAAD with coronary malperfusion and STEMI were analyzed, the diagnostic utility of PAA at 1 cm above the STJ was evident (C-statistics, 0.99; net reclassification improvement, 1.79; integrated discrimination improvement, 0.67), with PAA at 2 cm above the STJ ranking second in diagnostic significance (C-statistics, 0.99; net reclassification improvement, 1.12; integrated discrimination improvement, 0.66). Conclusions PAA measurements were the most beneficial for diagnosing TAAAD in all 2DE findings and TAAAD from STEMI."

    "abstract": "The objective is to describe the initial Canadian experience using novel aortic arch branched endograft technologies. We performed a retrospective consecutive case series of all patients undergoing aortic arch branched repair with newly available endograft technology since 2020 at our site. We describe the patient characteristics, treatment characteristics, and postoperative outcomes. Eleven patients received arch branched endografts, indicated for penetrating aortic ulcer in seven patients (64%), arch degeneration after prior aortic dissection repair in three (27%), and acute aortobronchial fistula in one patient (9%). Their average age was 72 ± 7 years. Complete arch repair from zone 0 to 4 was performed in six cases (55%); the remaining repairs landed proximally in zones 1 or 2. Seven repairs used a single retrograde facing inner branch (thoracic branch endoprosthesis; W.L. Gore & Associates), three used double antegrade inner branch (Bolton Relay; Terumo Interventional Systems), and one emergent case used double in situ fenestrations. Seven repairs (64%) used an adjunctive extra-anatomic bypass to complete great vessel perfusion, two of which were created during a prior aortic repair. Inferior vena cava balloon inflow occlusion during deployment was used in all cases. No mortalities, transient or permanent spinal cord paralysis, myocardial infarction, dialysis dependence, venous thromboembolism, or bleeding requiring reintervention occurred. No patient undergoing elective arch branch repair experienced a stroke. The one patient undergoing emergent repair did suffer a stroke. The median length of stay was 5 days (interquartile range, 2-8 days). Two endoleaks developed: a type Ia endoleak successfully treated with a Palmaz stent (Cordis) during the index admission, and a type II endoleak with ongoing sac regression on postoperative follow-up. Postoperatively, one patient suffered a suspected aortic graft infection that was treated with lifelong antibiotics. During a mean radiographic follow-up of 7.2 months, no cases of branch vessel instability (ie, no migration, reintervention, arterial rupture, intraluminal thrombus, occlusion, stenosis, or kinking of the branch grafts) developed. Three patients experienced sac regression of >5 mm, and no patient experienced continued postoperative dilation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest reported Canadian volume of aortic arch repair using novel branched or fenestrated technology. The series demonstrates that a multidisciplinary program and properly selected patients can yield excellent results using endovascular repair for complex aortic arch pathology."

Rituximab and plasmapheresis are treatments for cold agglutinin disease. However, its use in patients with Stanford type A dissection has not been reported. Therefore, after consultation with hematologists, we used rituximab and plasmapheresis before mild hypothermic aortic arch surgery to maintain the body temperature above the thermal altitude. This report describes an 86-year-old male patient with acute type A aortic dissection who received outpatient treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and a 55-mm thoracic aortic aneurysm. The patient was scheduled to undergo urgent surgery for a type A intramural hematoma and progressive aortic aneurysm; however, laboratory test results indicated blood clotting and cold agglutinin. Consequently, urgent surgery was rescheduled. After consulting with hematologists, rituximab was initiated 3 months before surgery, and plasmapheresis was performed 2 days before surgery for cold agglutinin disease. Under mild hypothermia conditions, total arch replacement using the frozen elephant trunk technique was performed while maintaining cerebral and lower body perfusion. The postoperative course was uneventful. On postoperative day 42, the patient was discharged without any neurological deficits. This case involving total arch replacement with mild hypothermia for an aortic arch aneurysm with cold agglutinin disease after rituximab treatment and plasmapheresis resulted in a successful outcome."

We herein describe a case of Stanford type A aortic dissection due to proximal SINE after TEVAR for Stanford type B dissection. This case involved a 58-year-old man with type A aortic dissection due to SINE. Six years previously, he had developed severe back pain and was diagnosed with type B aortic dissection after computed tomography examination. Because the primary entry was positioned at the descending aorta, we conducted TEVAR for exclusion of the entry with a GORE TAG conformable thoracic aortic graft. He was thereafter followed by our hospital. Six years later, he developed jaw pain and was examined at another hospital. He was transferred to our hospital because of the possibility of type A dissection. Computed tomography revealed type A aortic dissection with proximal site SINE. Emergency partial arch replacement was conducted, and he was discharged on postoperative day 27. Because the entry was at the lesser curve of the arch, we excluded the entry and conducted partial arch replacement. In this case, proximal SINE occurred 6 years after TEVAR. Because SINE may occur even in the long term after TEVAR, careful follow-up is necessary."

There were screening failures in previous studies, suggesting the need for a more accurate tool. This study investigated the effect of combining ADD-RS and age adjusted D-dimer (DDage-adj) with abnormal findings on chest radiographs on the diagnosis of AAS in patients admitted to emergency department (ED). This single-center retrospective case-control study included 93 patients with AAS and 465 with chest pain (CP), diagnosis other than AAS. We attempted to compare the initial clinical presentation and laboratory examination findings. Age-adjusted DD (DDage-adj), defined as age x 0.01 mg/L in patients ≥50 years, showed sensitivity of 92.5% and specificity of 76.3% for patients with AAS (p < 0.001). Positive chest radiography findings were significant with AAS group; sensitivity was 89.2% with a specificity of 80.9% (p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used; widened mediastinum, widening of aortic contour and aortic kinking indicates the probability of AAS in patients with CP (p < 0.05).ADD-RS was used to evaluate the risk of AAS. For low risk group, ADD-RS ≤1, combined use of chest radiography and DDage-adj showed meaningful result. Sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 67.1% with failure rate of 0% (p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis were made; widening of the mediastinum (p = 0.035), widening of the aortic contour (p < 0.001) and aortic kinking (p < 0.001) showed significant p-value. Combining DDage-adj and these three chest radiography findings in ADD-RS≤1 patients resulted 0% failure rate with 67.8% specificity (p < 0.001). The combination of ADD-RS, DDage-adj and chest radiography could lower the failure rate of AAS exclusion strategy. This combination strategy satisfies low failure rate (<3%) and yields relatively high specificity of 67.8%."

    "abstract": "Ascending aortic dissection is typically characterized by severe chest or back pain. However, its presentation can be atypical, leading to diagnostic challenges, especially in settings where classic symptomatology may not be evident. In this report, we described the case of a 74-year-old woman who presented to the emergency room of a rural community hospital with chief complaints of vertigo, nausea, and vomiting, without the classic symptoms of chest or back pain associated with aortic dissection. Despite initial treatment for autonomic dysregulation, the patient's symptoms persisted. Subsequent comprehensive assessments, including computed tomography angiography, revealed an ascending aortic dissection extending to the bilateral common carotid arteries. This atypical presentation, characterized by cerebral hypoperfusion and systemic hypotension without tachycardia, emphasizes the need to maintain a high suspicion index, even in the absence of hallmark symptoms. This case underscores the importance of considering the possibility of ascending aortic dissection in patients with nontraditional symptoms. Recognizing these atypical presentations is crucial for timely intervention, especially in rural settings with limited advanced diagnostic tools. This case also highlights potential sex disparities in symptom presentation, emphasizing the need for clinicians to recognize nontraditional symptoms in women. Rapid identification, evaluation, and management are imperative to prevent severe outcomes, and a multidisciplinary approach has proven to be the most effective in such cases."

However, because of limited time window available for clinical research, there is an urgent need for an ideal animal research model. In recent years, the incidence of AD complicated by atherosclerosis has increased with improvements of living standards and changes of eating habits. Accordingly, considering multiple risk factors, we successfully and efficiently established a novel AD model through a high-fat diet combined with chronic angiotensin II (AngII) infusion. Compared with traditional chemical induction model using AngII and β-aminopropionitrile, our model is more clinically relevant for atherosclerosis-related AD. Moreover, infiltration of neutrophils and apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells in AD tissues were more significant. In addition to enriching the existing models, the novel model may be a long-term useful tool for more in-depth investigation of AD mechanisms and preclinical therapeutic developments."

Computed tomography angiography was categorized as high quality (HQ), if all three main coronary arteries were analysable and low quality (LQ) otherwise. Curvilinear coronary images were rated by a DLM using the same system. Per-patient and per-vessel analyses were conducted. One hundred and twenty-one patients had HQ and 96 LQ CTA. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of the DLM in patients with high-quality image for detecting ≥50% stenoses were 100, 62, 59, 100, and 75% at the patient level and 98, 79, 57, 99, and 84% at the vessel level, respectively.

This report is of a 37-year-old woman presenting at 39 weeks of pregnancy with acute thoracic aortic dissection due to previously undiagnosed FBN1-related Marfan syndrome. This case report aims to illustrate the challenges in the diagnosis and in the peri-operative management of acute aortic dissection during pregnancy. CASE REPORT A healthy 37-year-old woman at 39 weeks of gestation presented to our hospital with dyspnea and chest pain. Initial evaluation for pulmonary embolism with chest computed tomography was unrevealing. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for further management. Overnight, her clinical conditions deteriorated, and a transthoracic echocardiography was obtained, demonstrating an acute ascending aortic dissection. She emergently underwent a successful combined cesarean section and ascending aortic dissection repair, with no immediate complications. On postoperative day 4 she developed cardiac tamponade, for which she underwent emergent mediastinal exploration. She was discharged home on postoperative day 10. A month later she completed genetic testing, which revealed a pathogenic mutation in the FBN1 gene, consistent with a molecular diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. CONCLUSIONS This report has shown that FBN1-related Marfan's syndrome has a variable clinical presentation that can include life-threatening aortic dissection during pregnancy. Successful diagnosis and management of these patients is challenging and requires multidisciplinary expertise, including confirmation of the diagnosis by a clinical geneticist."

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography( CT) revealed the presence of Stanford type A acute aortic dissection with critically narrow true lumen in the ascending aorta. Then, emergency surgery was performed. One umbilical tape tourniquet was placed around the ascending aorta. A vent tube was inserted into the main pulmonary artery. A venous drainage cannula was inserted into the right atrium. In the head-down position, pulmonary artery venting and venous drainage were initiated. As the blood puressure fell down around 40 mmHg, the ascending aorta was incised. A cannula (DLP 24 Fr) was placed in the true lumen and the aorta was snared. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established followed by selective antegrade cardioplegia, and systemic cooling. An entry was found in the ascending aorta, so ascending aorta graft replacement was performed under selective antegrade cerebral perfusion. There were no perioperative complications, and he was discharged home on 24th postoperative day. There is still remain controversies as to the optimal arterial cannulation site for cardiopulmonary bypass in patients with Stanford type A aortic dissection. We think the ascending aorta is most simply, rapidly and reliably available. In this case, direct true lumen cannulation in the ascending aorta was useful."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a serious cardiovascular emergency with high risk and mortality after surgery. Recent studies have shown that serum glucose-potassium ratio (GPR) is associated with the prognosis of cerebrovascular diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between GPR and in-hospital mortality in patients with ATAAD. From June 2019 to August 2021, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 272 patients who underwent ATAAD surgery. According to the median value of GPR (1.74), the patients were divided into two groups. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to determine the risk factors of in-hospital mortality after ATAAD. In-hospital death was significantly more common in the high GPR group (> 1.74) (24.4% vs 13.9%; P = 0.027). The incidence of renal dysfunction in the low GPR group was significantly higher than that in the high GPR group (26.3% vs 14.8%: P = 0.019). After controlling for potential confounding variables and adjusting for multivariate logistic regression analysis, the results showed a high GPR (> 1.74) (AOR 4.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.13-10.40; P =  < 0.001), lactic acid (AOR 1.14, 95% CI 1.03-1.26; P = 0.009), smokers (AOR 2.45, 95% CI 1.18-15.07; P = 0.039), mechanical ventilation (AOR 9.47, 95% CI 4.00-22.38; P =  < 0.001) was independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality in ATAAD patients, albumin (AOR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83-0.98; P = 0.014) was a protective factor for in-hospital prognosis. High GPR is a good predictor of in-hospital mortality after ATAAD surgery."

    "abstract": "The management of anastomosis and hemostasis of the dissected aorta remains challenging. This study aims to establish an optimal surgical strategy for type A acute aortic dissection by reviewing single-center data using the turn-up anastomosis technique. Between 2003 and 2015, 264 consecutive patients with type A acute aortic dissection who underwent emergency surgery within 14 days of symptom onset were enrolled. The mean age of the patients was 67.7 ± 13.4 years, and 129 were males. The operative time and surgical bleeding were 390.9 ± 144.5 min and 2983.8 ± 3026.5 mL, respectively. In-hospital mortality was observed in 25 patients (9.4%), and 3 (1.1%) experienced uncontrolled bleeding (from the aortic root in two patients and coagulopathy due to dabigatran in one patient). Immediate reopening for bleeding was performed in 20 patients, and bleeding from the aortic anastomosis was observed at three proximal and two distal sites. Proximal re-dissection was observed in 18 patients; in all of which, glue was used, although two re-ruptures of the aortic root were observed among those without glue use. The rates of freedom from all-cause death, aortic death, and aortic events at postoperative 5 years were 78.5 ± 2.7%, 86.8 ± 2.1%, and 74.4 ± 2.9%, respectively. When these values were stratified according to the operative extent, no significant differences were observed. Turn-up anastomosis facilitates short circulatory arrest, short operative time, and stable hemostasis, with few anastomotic complications during surgery for type A acute aortic dissection."

    "abstract": "Thermal therapy is expected to have an antihypertensive effect associated with increased blood flow and vasodilation. Here, we report a case of postoperative aortic dissection in which leg bathing was effective for treating hypertension. A 50-year-old female (body mass index: 25.3 kg/m2) underwent emergency surgery for Stanford type A aortic dissection and started early mobilization the following day. Even on postoperative day (POD) 28, the patient had repeated deviations from the blood pressure limit (systolic pressure 90-140 mmHg) during a 200-m walk. Therefore, leg bathing (42°C for 20 minutes) before walking for three days was started on POD 38. No changes in medications or other medical interventions from POD 28 until discharge from the hospital were made. Mean blood pressure values during the seven days before leg bathing were 151/94 mmHg at rest and 168/107 mmHg after walking, with a maximum value of 180/113 mmHg. After leg bathing, blood pressure after walking was 147/96 mmHg on day 1, 149/96 mmHg on day 2, and 127/82 mmHg on day 3. The mean blood pressure values during the seven days after three days of leg bathing were 137/81 mmHg at rest, 147/89 mmHg after walking, and 167/97 mmHg at maximum, with no more deviations from the blood pressure limit at rest and a slight increase with exercise. Three days of leg bathing produced sufficient antihypertensive effects for this patient. The findings in this case indicate the need for comparative studies with a control group in the future."

    "title": "Cardiac Tamponade Secondary to Hemorrhagic Pericardial Effusion: A Complication of STEMI.",
    "abstract": "Background: Most pericardial effusions that occur in the setting of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are small, simple, and without symptomology. However, in its most severe form, pericardial effusion can precipitate cardiac tamponade, and when untreated, can cause abrupt hemodynamic instability. Pericardial effusion may be a manifestation of left ventricular free-wall rupture, hemorrhagic pericarditis, or aortic dissection involving a coronary artery. Case Report: We describe the case of a 65-year-old male who experienced chest pain for several days prior to admission but delayed seeking care because he wished to avoid coronavirus disease 2019 exposure. Upon arrival, he was hemodynamically unstable. Electrocardiogram was consistent with anterior STEMI. Bedside echocardiogram demonstrated a hypertrophic left ventricle with preserved function and a large, complex pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade physiology. Computed tomography of the chest identified hemopericardium but was unable to delineate etiology. The patient underwent emergent thoracotomy because of persistent shock, and during the surgery, left ventricular free-wall rupture was identified and repaired. Coronary artery bypass grafting to the patient's left anterior descending artery was also performed. The patient remained asymptomatic at 2-year follow-up. Conclusion: The differential for hemodynamic compromise in a patient with STEMI is broad, but quickly distinguishing pump failure from other life-threatening causes of shock is imperative to dictate time-sensitive management decisions. The presence of a hemorrhagic pericardial effusion in the setting of STEMI is a surrogate marker for a severe infarct and can help the bedside physician determine whether a patient will be better served in the catheterization lab for revascularization or in the operating room for surgical repair."

    "abstract": "The early survival rate of patients with acute type A aortic dissection (TAAD) has improved remarkably over the past two decades. However, a false lumen may remain after proximal aortic repair and is a potential risk factor for aortic diameter enlargement, aortic rupture, and death in the chronic phase. In the stent-assisted balloon-induced intimal disruption and relamination of aortic dissection (STABILISE) technique, a stent graft is implanted at the proximal part of the aortic dissection, followed by bare-metal aortic stent placement over the distal aortic dissection. Next, an aortic balloon catheter is dilated inside the stent graft and the bare stent to disrupt the intima and collapse the false lumen, immediately restoring uniluminal thoracoabdominal aortic flow. This report describes our experience with the STABILISE technique for a residual aortic dissection after an ascending aorta, and partial aortic arch replacement for acute TAAD resulted in complications. A 60-year-old man presented to our hospital with chest pain, paresthesia, and left lower-limb paralysis. He was diagnosed with acute type A aortic dissection (TAAD) and malperfusion of the left lower limb by computed tomography (CT), and an emergent ascending aorta and partial aortic arch replacement were performed. Immediately after surgery, the left femoral arterial pulse improved, and left lower limb revascularization was deferred. The postoperative course was good; however, back pain and intermittent claudication recurred on the 9th day after surgery. A CT examination revealed persistent antegrade false lumen flow in the descending thoracic aorta through the left subclavian artery dissection and retrograde false lumen flow from the thoracoabdominal segment, resulting in aortic diameter enlargement and narrowing of the true lumen. The symptoms did not improve, and the STABILISE technique was performed on the 12th day after the initial aortic surgery. The patient's subsequent course was good; the back pain and intermittent claudication resolved. The patient was discharged on the 8th day after the STABILISE technique. The STABILISE technique can obliterate the false lumen and resolve symptoms associated with a residual false lumen after proximal aortic repair for acute TAAD."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the clinical effectiveness of the SilverFlow branch stent through endovascular isolation and in situ fenestration (ISF) for the treatment of aortic dissection (AD) involving the aortic arch. A total of 21 patients with AD involving the aortic arch, admitted to our hospital between September 2021 and January 2023, were selected for this prospective study. All patients underwent treatment with an endoluminal isolated ISF-covered stent, with the branch stent being the SilverFlow, developed by Shenzhen Xianjian Company. We assessed the success rate of the ISF procedure stent-related complications and compared the volumes of the true and false cavities before and after treatment. Follow-up evaluations were conducted 1, 3, and 6 months post-operation, focusing on neurological complications, mortality, and the need for secondary interventional treatment. Among the 21 AD patients with aortic arch involvement, 20 (95.23%) underwent non-emergency surgery, while 1 (4.76%) required emergency surgery due to cardiac ischemia and signs of dissection rupture. All surgeries were successfully completed. After treatment, the average volume of the true lumen significantly decreased compared to pre-treatment levels, while the volume of the false lumen significantly increased (P < .05). The success rate was 100%, with only one case (4.76%) experiencing type I internal leakage. There were no cases of stent displacement, distortion, or fenestration vessel occlusion. One patient (4.76%) succumbed to acute pericardial tamponade, resulting in a mortality rate of 4.76%. Another patient (4.76%) suffered from upper limb ischemia, significantly improving with antithrombotic drug treatment. No occurrences of stroke, visceral ischemia, or other complications were reported, and no secondary interventional treatments were required. The application of the SilverFlow branch stent for endovascular isolation of ISF in AD cases involving the aortic arch demonstrates a high success rate, low complication and mortality rates, and significant clinical feasibility and value."

Although the rule-out strategy does show exciting potential, it remains to be validated, especially for Australasian patients. Patients with suspected AAS should continue to be investigated with timely advanced imaging such as contrast-enhanced computed tomographic aortography."

    "abstract": "Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue 1 (MALT1) regulates inflammation and T helper (Th) cell differentiation, which may participate in the progression of Stanford type A aortic dissection (TAAD). This study intended to assess the association of MALT1 expression with prognosis in TAAD patients. In this prospective study, MALT1 expression was measured by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay from peripheral blood samples in 100 TAAD patients and 100 non-AD controls (non-AD patients with chest pain) before treatment. Besides, Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells of TAAD patients before treatment were measured by flow cytometry assay, and their 30-day mortality was recorded. MALT1 expression was ascended in TAAD patients vs. non-AD controls (P < 0.001). In TAAD patients, elevated MALT1 expression was linked with hypertension complication (P = 0.009), increased systolic blood pressure (r = 0.291, P = 0.003), C-reactive protein (CRP) (r = 0.286, P = 0.004), and D-dimer (r = 0.359, P < 0.001). Additionally, MALT1 expression was positively correlated with Th1 cells (r = 0.312, P = 0.002) and Th17 cells (r = 0.397, P < 0.001), but not linked with Th2 cells (r = -0.166, P = 0.098). Notably, the 30-day mortality of TAAD patients was 28.0%. MALT1 expression [odds ratio (OR) = 1.936, P = 0.004], CRP (OR = 1.108, P = 0.002), D-dimer (OR = 1.094, P = 0.003), and surgery timing (emergency vs. selective) (OR = 8.721, P = 0.024) independently predicted increased risk of death within 30 days in TAAD patients. Furthermore, the combination of the above-mentioned independent factors had an excellent ability in predicting 30-day mortality with the area under curve of 0.949 (95% confidence interval: 0.909-0.989). MALT1 expression relates to increased Th1 cells, Th17 cells, and 30-day mortality risk in TAAD patients."

The accuracies of detecting IT and ULP were compared among only diastolic-phase, only systolic-phase, and both diastolic-phase and systolic-phase methods of retrospective ECG-gated CT; surgical or angiographical findings were used as the reference standard. The detection accuracy for IT and ULP using only diastolic-phase, only systolic-phase, and both diastolic-phase and systolic-phase methods of ECG-gated CT was 93% [95% CI: 87-97], 94% [95% CI: 88-97], and 95% [95% CI: 90-97], respectively. There were no significant differences in detection accuracy among the 3 acquisition methods (P = 0.55). Similarly, there were no significant differences in the accuracy of detecting IT in AD (P = 0.55) and ULP in IMH (P > 0.99) among only diastolic-phase, only systolic-phase, and both diastolic- and systolic-phase ECG-gated CT.Retrospective ECG-gated CT for detecting IT in AD and ULP in IMH yields highly accurate findings.

    "abstract": "Chest pain is one of the major causes for admission in the Emergency Room in most countries and one of the principal reasons for urgent consultation with a cardiologist or a general practitioner. After clinical examination and initial biological measurements, substantial patients require further explorations. CT scan allows the search for pulmonary embolism in the early stage of pulmonary arteries iodine contrast exploration. During the same exam at the systemic arterial phase, the search for aortic dissection or coronary artery disease is possible while exploring the later contrast in the aortic artery. This triple rule-out exam allows correct diagnosis in case of acute chest pain with suspected pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection and other acute aortic syndromes or acute coronary syndrome. But X-rays are substantially increased as well as iodine contrast agent quantity while exam quality is globally decreased. Artificial intelligence may play an important role in the development of this protocol."

A 65-year-old man presented with pyrexia and nausea. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) performed on admission revealed a hematoma between the lower esophagus and descending aorta due to a contained rupture of a PAU, which was undiagnosed at that time. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) performed on the fifth day of admission revealed a subepithelial lesion in the lower esophagus, further complicated by ulcer formation. Biopsy did not reveal any malignant findings. On the eighth day of admission, the patient experienced substantial hematemesis with vital signs indicative of shock. Emergency EGD was performed, which revealed life-threatening bleeding in the lower esophagus. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed an aortoesophageal fistula with massive hematemesis, after which the patient died. An autopsy revealed perforation of the PAU into the esophagus without aortic dissection or a true aneurysm.Patients with atherosclerosis who develop recent-onset gastrointestinal symptoms, progressive anemia, and/or periaortic lesions should be carefully evaluated using contrast-enhanced CT, and PAU should be considered in the differential diagnosis."

This study aims to report the characteristics and treatments of 31 patients with SIAAD in the past 12 years. A total of 31 consecutive patients with SIAAD between 2010 and 2022 were included. The clinical manifestations, treatment strategies, and outcomes were reviewed. Following the SVS/STS reporting standard, we compared the clinical characteristics with different locations of primary entry, or different numbers of dissected zones. Furthermore, we compared the effects of surgical and conservative therapies on the outcome during the follow-up. Among the 31 patients with SIAAD, 16 (51.6%) were in the acute phase on admission. The primary entry of SIAAD was mainly located in Zone 9 (67.7%). Most patient presented with dissection involving 1 or 2 aortic zones (61.3%). In addition, 35.5% and 64.5% of SIAADs involved the visceral and iliac arteries, respectively. Compared with asymptomatic SIAADs, the symptomatic ones had longer dissection lengths (P = 0.008) and tended to involve iliac artery more frequently (P = 0.098). There were differences in the number of dissected aortic zones (P = 0.005) among patients with primary entry located in Zone 5 (Supraceliac aorta), Zone 6-8 (Paravisceral aorta) and Zone 9 (Infrarenal aorta). The involvement of visceral artery (P = 0.039) and iliac artery (P = 0.006) was significantly different between the subgroups of SIAAD involving one, two, and three or more aortic zones. The cumulative incidence of adverse false lumen progression events was significantly lower (P = 0.000) and the rate of false lumen thrombogenesis or disappearance was higher in patients receiving surgery (P = 0.001). The cumulative all-cause mortality was 9.7% at 1-year, and 19.7% at 5-year, with no significant difference between surgical and conservative therapies. Clinical features of SIAAD vary depending on the location of the primary entry and the number of dissected aortic zones. Although surgery was not associated with a lower all-cause mortality compared with conservative therapy, it was associated with a lower incidence of adverse false lumen progression and a higher rate of aortic remodeling."

Transvenous access to the aorta is described as an alternative access method to deliver aortic endografts in emergency situations. A 68-year-old female patient with severely compromised iliac and subclavian artery access was treated for a ruptured extent V thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm with a t-Branch (Cook Medical, Bjaeverskov, Denmark) delivered through a transcaval access. To avoid severe aortocaval shunting a balloon-expandable covered stent was deployed through a carotid access due to severe bilateral subclavian ostial stenosis. A 71-year-old man with an acute type B aortic dissection and bilateral narrow long-segment stenting of the iliac arteries was treated with a physician-modified thoracic endovascular aortic repair using an arteriovenous fenestration created at the level of the common iliac artery. We describe the access creation by fenestration using a transseptal needle. Transvenous access for thoracic and thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm repair is safe and feasible in selected emergent cases.Clinical ImpactA transvenous approach may be helpful in selected patients when an endovascular repair needs to be performed but no arterial femoral access is available.

    "abstract": "Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in children and adolescents after blunt traumatic aortic injury (BTAI) is being performed increasingly despite no endovascular graft being approved for TEVAR in this population. The smaller diameter of the aorta and access vessels and steeper angle of the aortic arch pose specific challenges for TEVAR in this population. Moreover, data are lacking regarding medium to long term complications. This case presents an adolescent patient who underwent TEVAR for BTAI and suffered a focal aortic dissection several months later. The patient initially presented after a motor vehicle accident and underwent an uncomplicated TEVAR procedure with a 28 mm diameter stent graft (the smallest device available at the time) for Grade III traumatic aortic dissection; the native aortic diameter was 15 mm. The diameter mismatch was accepted due to the lifesaving nature of the procedure. More than 7 months later the patient presented to the emergency department after not being able to urinate for several days and experiencing pain, tingling, and weakness in both legs. Blood samples showed a severe acute kidney injury and computed tomography angiography showed significant aortic stenosis in the distal part of the stent graft, probably caused by a focal dissection. The stenosis and dissection were successfully treated using a Palmaz stent, after which his renal function and extremity complaints recovered. The focal dissection was probably caused by stress on the aortic wall due to the aorta-stent graft diameter mismatch. This case demonstrates that complications after TEVAR in adolescents can arise months after the initial procedure and underscores the need for continued vigilance, especially in cases with an aorta-stent graft mismatch. The threshold for additional imaging and consultation by a vascular surgeon should be low."

Overall, 51.0% of patients were nondirect admissions. On arrival, 23.1% of patients were in shock, 10.0% in cardiopulmonary arrest, and 11.8% in deep coma or coma. Overall, 9.8% of patients were assessed as untreatable. Of 2979 treatable patients, 18.3% underwent medical treatment, whereas 80.7% underwent surgery (open [78.8%], endovascular [1.9%], and peripheral [1.1%] repair). The early mortality rate was 20.5%, including untreatable cases. Among treatable patients, in-hospital mortality rates were 8.6% for open repair, 10.7% for endovascular repair, and 25.3% for medical treatment. Advanced age, preoperative comorbidities, classical dissection, and medical treatment were risk factors for in-hospital mortality. Nondirect admission did not cause increased deaths. The mortality rates were high during the superacute phase following symptom onset. This study demonstrated current practices in the emergency care of type A acute aortic dissection via the Tokyo Acute Aortic Super Network system, specifically a high rate of untreatable or inoperable cases and favorable outcomes in patients undergoing surgical treatment.

We report a case of spinal cord ischemia occurred in a young woman treated with endovascular scissor technique in urgent setting. The patient had an uneventful post-procedural course. After 4 months, computed tomography angiography confirmed false lumen reperfusion and major symptoms were regressed. In selected cases, this procedure is a tool to improve false lumen perfusion in type B dissections, and demonstrated to be helpful in our case of spinal cord ischaemia."

    "abstract": "Intramural esophageal dissection (IED), characterized by bleeding into the submucosal space, leads to mucosal separation and dissection. The most prevalent symptoms are sudden chest or retrosternal pain, hematemesis, and dysphagia. Therefore, acute coronary syndrome and aortic dissection are among its most notable differential diagnoses. A 31-year-old pregnant woman presented with acute chest pain, laryngeal discomfort, and hematemesis. Emergency esophagogastroscopy revealed longitudinal mucosal dissection (upper esophagus to esophagogastric junction). The patient was successfully treated by avoiding the ingestion of solid foods. Clinicians should consider a diagnosis of IED for pregnant patients with acute chest pain, especially if hematemesis is present."

    "title": "Association between Bilateral Selective Antegrade Cerebral Perfusion and Postoperative Ischemic Stroke in Patients with Emergency Surgery for Acute Type A Aortic Dissection-Single Centre Experience.",
    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a surgical emergency with a mortality of 1-2% per hour. Since its discovery over 200 years ago, surgical techniques for repairing a dissected aorta have evolved, and with the introduction of hypothermic circulatory arrest and cerebral perfusion, complex techniques for replacing the entire aortic arch were possible. However, postoperative neurological complications contribute significantly to mortality in this group of patients. The aim of this study was to determine the association between different bilateral selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP) times and the incidence of postoperative ischemic stroke in patients with emergency surgery for ATAAD. Patients with documented hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, clinical signs of stroke or neurological dysfunction prior to surgery, that died on the operating table or within 48 h after surgery, from whom the postoperative neurological status could not be assessed, and with incomplete medical records were excluded from this study. The diagnosis of postoperative stroke was made using head computed tomography imaging (CT) when clinical suspicion was raised by a neurologist in the immediate postoperative period. For selective bilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion, we used two balloon-tipped cannulas inserted under direct vision into the innominate artery and the left common carotid artery. Each cannula is connected to a separate pump with an independent pressure line. Near-infrared spectroscopy was used in all cases for cerebral oxygenation monitoring. The circulatory arrest was initiated after reaching a target core temperature of 25-28 °C. In total, 129 patients were included in this study. The incidence of postoperative ischemic stroke documented on a head CT was 24.8% (31 patients), and postoperative death was 20.9% (27 patients). The most common surgical technique performed was supravalvular ascending aorta and Hemiarch replacement with a Dacron graft in 69.8% (90 patients). The mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 210 +/- 56.874 min, the mean aortic cross-clamp time was 114.775 +/- 34.602 min, and the mean cerebral perfusion time was 37.837 +/- 18.243 min. Using logistic regression, selective ACP of more than 40 min was independently associated with postoperative ischemic stroke (OR = 3.589; 95%CI = 1.418-9.085; p = 0.007). Considering the high incidence of postoperative stroke in our study population, we concluded that bilateral selective ACP should be used with caution, especially in patients with severely calcified ascending aorta and/or aortic arch and supra-aortic vessels. All efforts should be made to minimize the duration of circulatory arrest when using bilateral selective ACP with a target of less than 30 min, in hypothermia, at a body temperature of 25-28 °C."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is a life-threatening acute condition characterized by the separation of the aortic wall's layers. It is caused by a tear in the internal vascular wall (intimal layer and middle layer), which results in bleeding between the layers and causes abrupt and excruciating pain. The appropriate consideration must be given to the condition's dynamic nature, and variations in clinical presentation, without neglecting the urgency for intervention. In this case study, a 65-year-old male engaged in a car accident is admitted to urgent care with a traumatic aortic dissection diagnosis that included the aortic arch, a segmental exposed fracture of 1/3 distal of the right femur AO 32C3k, and an intertrochanteric fracture AO 31A1.3. The patient developed transient paraplegia as the initial manifestation of acute aortic dissection, which represents a high mortality and morbidity entity without adequate and prompt treatment, and prompt diagnosis and management were critical. A patient with severe thoracic and abdominal trauma caused by high-energy injury should be properly evaluated for the possibility of traumatic aortic dissection. The endovascular aortic repair was performed, resulting in a positive clinical evolution due to the important participation of the multidisciplinary trauma team involved in patient management and prompted decision-making."

    "abstract": "Whether in patients with acute type A aortic dissection reduction of intervals between onset of symptoms and diagnosis influences patient outcomes is still not completely defined. In 199 patients with acute type A aortic dissection, the efficacy of a systematic multidisciplinary approach and institution of a regional network were evaluated; 90 patients operated before 2016 (Group1) were compared with 109 repaired after 2016 (Group2) for early and late outcomes. Mortality was reduced from 13% in Group1 to 4% in Group2 (p = 0.013). In Group2 a more patients (46%) had arch replacement compared to Group1 (29%)(p = 0.06). In Group2 axillary artery cannulation was almost routinely used (91% vs 67%, p < 0.001) with shorter circulatory arrest time (37 vs 44 min, p < 0.001). The interval from diagnosis to surgery dropped from 210 min in Group1 to 160 min in Group2 (p < 0.001); this reduction was evident both in patients admitted to the emergency department of a spoke and/or a hub center. Patients presenting with or developing shock were reduced from Group1 to Group2 and in particular those reaching the hub center from spoke centers. Survival at 1 and 5 years was 82 ± 4% and 70 ± 5% in Group1 vs 92 ± 3% and 87 ± 8% in Group2 (p = 0.007). Outcomes of patients with acute type A aortic dissection improved using a systematic multidisciplinary approach while a network between spoke and hub centers reduced intervals between diagnosis, transportation to hub center and repair, limiting the incidence of tamponade and shock."

Initial watch-and-wait strategy was indicated if the maximum aortic diameter was < 50 mm, pain score was < 3/10 on the numerical rating scale, and no ulcer-like projection was observed in the ascending aorta. The primary endpoints of this study were all-cause and aorta-related deaths, and the secondary endpoint was aortic events. Initial watch-and-wait strategy was indicated in 52 patients. Emergency aortic repair was indicated in the remaining 48 patients; 2, 31, and 15 patients died before surgery, underwent emergency surgery, and declined emergency surgery, respectively. Among the watch-and-wait group, 11 (21%) patients underwent aortic repair during hospitalization. In-hospital mortality rates, 5-year survival rates, and 5-year freedom from aorta-related death were not significantly different between the initial watch-and-wait strategy and emergency surgery (2% vs. 6%, 92% vs. 82%, and 100% vs. 94%, respectively). In the initial watch-and-wait strategy group, 5-year freedom from aortic events and freedom from aortic events involving the ascending aorta were 60% and 66%, respectively. The early and midterm outcomes with the initial watch-and-wait strategy in patients with type A intramural hematoma with a maximum aortic diameter of ≤ 50 mm, pain score of ≤ 3/10, and no ulcer-like projection in the ascending aorta were favorable with no aorta-related death."

    "title": "Analysing debranching techniques in Frozen Elephant Trunk procedures: a narrative literature review.",
    "abstract": "Since 2003, the Frozen Elephant Trunk (FET) technique has attained rising popularity for treating extensive aortic arch pathologies such as acute and chronic aortic dissection, as well as thoracic aortic aneurysm. Conventionally, the FET procedure included a complete resection of the aortic arch and, subsequently, a distal aortic anastomosis of the prosthetic part of the hybrid graft in arch zone 3. Simultaneous to the introduction of the FET technique, the traditional Elephant Trunk technique was simplified by adding debranching techniques which allows for proximalization of the distal aortic anastomosis. Nowadays, modern concepts of aortic arch surgery combine the FET technique with proximalization of the distal anastomosis in arch zone 2 or further proximal, achieved by using different debranching techniques. This review describes different debranching techniques to facilitate arch reconstruction, and aims to critically assess the outcomes and potential clinical advantages of proximalization using debranching in FET surgery. We conducted a search using the PubMed and Google Scholar electronic databases to evaluate published outcomes of different debranching techniques. An overview of the data synthesis of 21 included studies is reported. Most studies report numeric, but not statistically significant improved outcomes after debranching in FET surgery for mortality, neurological complications, spinal cord injury, kidney failure, bowel ischemia and recurrent nerve palsy. Some studies report statistically significant improved results in isolated endpoints such as neurological, bowel ischemia, and recurrent nerve palsy. Most studies report debranching to be technically easier, but this is difficult to objectively assess and measure. There is an improved numeric outcome of different debranching techniques with proximalization of the distal anastomosis, but without reaching statistical significance. This review shows marked heterogeneity across included studies and highlights the scarce use of existing guidelines in clinical research of open aortic arch surgery as proposed by the International Aortic Arch Surgery Study Group. Furthermore, this review demonstrates the urgent need for multicenter registries or studies to be able to compare the outcome of different surgical techniques for various aortic arch pathologies."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is exceedingly rare in the pediatric population. However, it is much more common among children and adolescents with certain underlying syndromes, including Turner syndrome. Furthermore, aortic dissection carries significant mortality without prompt diagnosis and management. Therefore, pediatric emergency providers should know how to recognize and treat pediatric aortic dissection in a patient with Turner syndrome. We designed this simulation for pediatric emergency medicine fellows. A simulated adolescent female patient with a known history of Turner syndrome presents with chest pain, tachycardia, and hypertension. Participants must order and interpret the appropriate diagnostics, diagnose aortic dissection, and manage aortic dissection adequately. This simulation was completed by six pediatric emergency medicine fellows and one pediatric resident. After completing the simulation, six participants (85.7%) provided anonymous feedback on a five-point Likert scale (one = strongly disagree, five = strongly agree). Feedback was positive, and participants agreed that the case content was relevant to their clinical practice and that the event will improve their clinical practice. This simulation encourages participants to recognize and manage pediatric aortic dissection in patients with Turner syndrome. Participants felt that the simulation was relevant and will improve their clinical practice."

Coronary angiography (CA) is a widely utilized diagnostic procedure used to evaluate blood flow through the coronary arteries and detect coronary artery disease (CAD). Despite its widespread use, it has complications including non-life-threatening, while there are some rare complications that can occur. We present a case of an elderly woman who presented with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent CA without evidence of CAD. However, the patient later developed type A aortic dissection (AD) as a complication of the procedure. Surgery is considered emergent treatment for type A-AD, but the patient was asymptomatic without any complaint, shared decision making was conducted and the patient decided to pursue conservative treatment without surgical intervention. Therefore, managing AD should be tailored to each patient individually through shared-decision making."

A 50-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department with an acute type B aortic dissection. Conservative medical treatment did control blood pressure but did not alleviate her dissection symptoms. She was treated endovascularly with multilayer stents extensively covering the whole dissected area. HThe aortic arch side branches, visceral arteries and renal arteries remained patent after treatment. The recovery was uneventful, and she was discharged the day after the intervention. At 6- and 12-month follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic, the true lumen volume increased and all side branches remained patent. We present a case of the use of a multilayer stent for acute type B aortic dissection. This technique allows to treat the whole dissection with low risk of paraplegia or side branch occlusion. Long-term results of ongoing clinical studies should confirm the place of the multilayer stent as a treatment option for type B aortic dissection."

    "abstract": "Although unexpected cardiac arrest is a very rare intraoperative complication, strategies regarding preoperative screening and procedures to be taken in the event of an emergency need to be well established. A man in his late 70 s diagnosed with thoracic esophageal cancer, cT3N1M0, and cStage III was admitted. His metabolic equivalents were 4 or more. Electrocardiogram (ECG), ultrasound cardiography, and hematological examinations revealed no severe abnormalities. Computed tomography (CT) showed highly calcified coronary arteries. We performed mediastinoscope-assisted transhiatal esophagectomy. Procedures in the mediastinum involving access from the neck and abdomen were completed uneventfully. Middle mediastinal lymph node dissection and gastrointestinal reconstruction with the patient in the prone position were scheduled for later. However, before the change in position, pulseless nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) suddenly occurred and caused blood pressure to drop sharply to below 30 mmHg. The VT disappeared in approximately 20 s, and there was a return to sinus rhythm after cardiac resuscitation; however, the ECG showed a decrease in the ST segments of leads II, III, and aVF. Immediately thereafter, the patient was transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for percutaneous coronary intervention. Cardiac catheterization revealed diffuse stenosis of 90% in the left anterior descending branch of the coronary artery (segment no. 6). Plain old balloon angioplasty and stent placement were performed. Dual antiplatelet therapy was needed. On the next day, thoracoscopic esophagectomy was performed in the left lateral decubitus position, followed by cervical esophagostomy in the supine position. He developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and thoracic aortic dissection on the 5th postoperative day (POD) and intraperitoneal bleeding on the 16th POD. On the 105th POD, laparoscopic-assisted cervical esophagogastric anastomosis was performed. Parkinson's disease was diagnosed on the 126th POD. On the 313th POD, the patient was discharged. Surgeons should be familiar with the guidelines for patient screening and management of intraoperative cardiac arrest. In patients with severe coronary artery calcification, further investigation such as coronary angiography CT may be necessary before esophagectomy. Furthermore, highly invasive surgery should be performed in well-equipped hospitals."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a serious and life-threatening cardiovascular emergency. This study aim to investigate whether MicroRNAs (miRNAs)in circulating exosomes could serve as novel diagnostic biomarkers for AAD. Using miRNA microarray sequencing, the differentially expressed exosomal miRNAs between AAD patients and control subjects were found. In this study, we investigated 8 miRNAs (miR-499a-5p/miR-543/miR-143-3p/miR-4433b-3p/miR-744-5p/miR-4488/miR-202-3p/miR-206), 4 Proteins (Matrix Metalloprotein-9/12)/transforming growth factor-β/D-Dimer) in AAD (n = 75) and Control (n = 86) expression levels between the 2 groups. The combined diagnostic of exosomal miRNAs and Proteins was performed (area under curve [AUC] > 0.8, R > 0.5 and P < .01). The Receiver Operating Characteristic curve was drawn to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy. Predict the gene targets of differentially expressed miRNAs and analyze the functions and signaling pathways of these targets using online databases. The exosomes isolated from the 2 groups of serum were bilayer membranes with a diameter of about 100 nm. Stably expressed in CD9, CD63 and TSG101. Compared with the control subjects, 8 exosomal miRNAs (miR-499a-5p, miR-543, miR-206, miR-143-3p, miR-4433b-3p, miR-744-5p, miR- 4488, and miR-202-3p) were regulated to varying degrees (P < .05). miR-499a-5p, miR-202-3p, and D-Dimer had higher diagnostic efficacy (AUC > 0.90). Among them, miR-499a-5p had the highest diagnostic accuracy, reaching 95%, AUC = 0.99. Co-diagnosis of positively correlated miRNAs and Proteins improves the diagnostic performance. The combined diagnostic accuracy of miR-499a-5p and miR-202-3p was 98% (AUC = 0.998), and the sensitivity and specificity were 98%. The combined diagnostic accuracy of miR-499a-5p and matrix metalloprotein-9 was 98% (AUC = 0.996), and the sensitivity and specificity were 98%. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes signaling pathway analysis, some predicted targets of these miRNAs are involved in the pathophysiological process of AAD. Serum exosomal miR-499a-5p, miR-143-3p, and miR-202-3p can be used as potential diagnostic biomarkers for AAD, and the combination of various markers can coordinate and complement each other, and can significantly improve the diagnosis of aortic dissection sensitivity and specificity."

Careful inspection of contrast- enhanced computed tomography revealed Kommerell's diverticulum with the aberrant right subclavian artery running behind the esophagus. The artery connected to the right axillary artery. The left vertebral artery was separately branched from the aortic arch. Primary entry was not detected on the preoperative computed tomography( CT). Left ventricular function was preserved by transthoracic echocardiography. At emergency surgery, total aortic arch replacement with reconstruction of the right axillary artery, both carotid arteries, and the left subclavian artery along with the left vertebral artery was successfully performed. The aberrant right subclavian artery was ligated at the origin. Kommerell' s diverticulum was completely excluded. Postoperative contrast-enhanced CT showed the patency of all reconstructed arteries.

    "abstract": "An analysis was conducted to demonstrate early and midterm outcomes of using adjustable puncture needle-based in situ fenestration (ISF) technique for Ankura aortic stent graft to reconstruct the supra-arch branch in thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). A retrospective analysis of 68 cases of aortic lesions with insufficient proximal anchoring area admitted to our department from March 2017 to December 2021 was performed. In situ fenestration thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) was performed at the same time during the operation. Among them, there were fifty-eight cases of thoracic aortic dissection, seven cases of thoracic aortic aneurysm, and three cases of thoracic aortic ulcer. Intraoperative adjustable puncture with needle was used for the Ankura aorta stent graft to perform ISF and reconstruction of the supra-arch branch. The success rate of ISF was 94.1% (64/68). Only in four cases, attempts were made to create ISF in the left subclavian artery (LSA), and all the four were unsuccessful because of sharp and tortuosity angle. Among them, forty-four cases were only LSA fenestration, and one case was left common carotid artery (LCCA) fenestration + LSA embolism. LSA + left vertebral artery (LVA) fenestration was performed in two cases, LSA fenestration +LCCA chimney was performed in fourteen cases, LCCA + LSA fenestration + innominate artery (INA) chimney was performed in one case, and LCCA fenestration + INA chimney + LSA embolism was performed in two cases. The overall neurologic event rate was 3.1% (spinal cord ischemia 0, with stroke observed in two cases). Postoperatively, one patient (1.6%) died on the third day after TEVAR due to the retrograde dissections. There were four cases of endoleak (6.3%; three type I and one type II). The average follow-up was 29.2 ± 14.4 months, and no patient died during the follow-up period. Three cases of endoleak disappeared, and one case did not increase further. In addition, other two cases of retrograde dissections were observed at 3 and 5 months after TEVAR. Fortunately, they were scheduled for emergency surgery with ascending aorta replacement and improved well. There was only one case of LSA occlusion after ISF which was reconstructed by endovascular treatment. Two patients were found with distal stent graft-induced new entries (dSINE), and TEVAR was performed again during the follow-up period. Early and midterm outcomes demonstrated that ISF via the adjustable puncture needle device for the Ankura aorta stent graft is a feasible and effective treatment method, which can achieve high technical success and satisfactory short-term results."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) is a severe cardiovascular disease characterized by aortic rupture, aortic valve insufficiency, aortic branch lumen stenosis, and occlusion. Acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction may be the primary manifestation when aortic dissection affects the coronary artery, leading to delayed or missed diagnosis of aortic dissection, and preventing patients from receiving timely and comprehensive treatment. Simultaneous aortic repair and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery are controversial because of their high mortality rates. Personalized and optimal treatment plans for patients should be taken seriously based on their different conditions and treatment options. A 42-year-old man who experienced 1 h of persistent precordialgia was admitted to a local second-level hospital for emergency treatment. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed evidence of ST-segment elevation, and myocardial enzyme levels were CK-MB 18.35 ng/ml and troponin 0.42 ng/ml. The patient was treated for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and urgently sent to the interventional catheter room. Coronary angiography showed stenosis of the starting part of the right coronary artery trunk. Thus, stent implantation was performed, and the stenosis section recovered patency; however, postoperative precordialgia was not alleviated. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed a type A AD. The patient was immediately transferred to a higher-level hospital, underwent emergency surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) ascending aorta replacement, SUN's procedure (total arch replacement and stented elephant trunk implantation), and simultaneous implantation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and regained consciousness within intensive care unit care. ECMO was discontinued when hemodynamics stabilized. The patient ultimately recovered well and was discharged. This case demonstrated that precordialgia is not limited to myocardial infarction but may also be accompanied by aortic dissection. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can timely and effectively restore coronary artery perfusion, strive for the opportunity of aortic repair surgery, and can overcome pump failure caused by myocardial infarction, cardiopulmonary bypass, heart block time, and myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Personalized treatment is crucial for patients with complex type A aortic dissection."

    "title": "Cardiac tamponade.",
    "abstract": "Cardiac tamponade is a medical emergency caused by the progressive accumulation of pericardial fluid (effusion), blood, pus or air in the pericardium, compressing the heart chambers and leading to haemodynamic compromise, circulatory shock, cardiac arrest and death. Pericardial diseases of any aetiology as well as complications of interventional and surgical procedures or chest trauma can cause cardiac tamponade. Tamponade can be precipitated in patients with pericardial effusion by dehydration or exposure to certain medications, particularly vasodilators or intravenous diuretics. Key clinical findings in patients with cardiac tamponade are hypotension, increased jugular venous pressure and distant heart sounds (Beck triad). Dyspnoea can progress to orthopnoea (with no rales on lung auscultation) accompanied by weakness, fatigue, tachycardia and oliguria. In tamponade caused by acute pericarditis, the patient can experience fever and typical chest pain increasing on inspiration and radiating to the trapezius ridge. Generally, cardiac tamponade is a clinical diagnosis that can be confirmed using various imaging modalities, principally echocardiography. Cardiac tamponade is preferably resolved by echocardiography-guided pericardiocentesis. In patients who have recently undergone cardiac surgery and in those with neoplastic infiltration, effusive-constrictive pericarditis, or loculated effusions, fluoroscopic guidance can increase the feasibility and safety of the procedure. Surgical management is indicated in patients with aortic dissection, chest trauma, bleeding or purulent infection that cannot be controlled percutaneously. After pericardiocentesis or pericardiotomy, NSAIDs and colchicine can be considered to prevent recurrence and effusive-constrictive pericarditis."

    "title": "Aortic Dissection Presenting as a STEMI.",
    "abstract": "This scenario was developed to educate emergency medicine residents on the presentation and management of a patient with a Stanford type A aortic dissection. Chest pain is one of the most common chief complaints seen in the emergency department with a deadly differential diagnosis list. A \"can't miss\" diagnosis, aortic dissection occurs when an intimal tear creates a false lumen in the aorta, with a variably reported incidence of approximately 2.5-5 per 100,000 person-years.1 This amounts to an estimated 8,000-16,000 cases per year in the United States with a mortality likely underestimated due to prehospital death ranging from 20-40% within 24 hours and 30-50% at 5 years.2,3,4 There is a reported increase in mortality by 1% for every hour the diagnosis is delayed, and half of diagnoses are made greater than 24 hours after presentation.5 The symptoms can range from chest pain to back pain, abdominal pain or extremity pain, to syncope or isolated neurologic deficits, even to shock or cardiac arrest.6 Aortic dissection is most commonly categorized into two groups: Stanford type A, involving the ascending aorta, and Stanford type B, involving only the descending aorta, and are generally managed surgically vs. medically respectively based on this paradigm.7,8 Stanford type A can be complicated by severe aortic regurgitation, pericardial tamponade or coronary artery occlusion mimicking ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). These potentials make it important to switch from heuristic to analytical thinking when developing a differential diagnosis.9 A high index of suspicion with early recognition and management is critical in this catastrophic disease state, especially given the propensity for complications and a wide variety of presentations. At the conclusion of the simulation session or during the debriefing session, learners will be able to: 1) Verbalize the anatomical differences and management of Stanford type A and type B aortic dissections, 2) Describe physical exam findings that may be found with ascending aortic dissections, 3) Describe the various clinical manifestations of the propagation of aortic dissections, 4) Discuss the management of aortic dissection, including treatment and disposition. This session was conducted using a simulation scenario with a high-fidelity manikin as the patient and confederate/actor in the nursing role, followed by a post-scenario debriefing session on the presentation, differential diagnosis, potential physical exam findings, and management of patients with aortic dissection. Debriefing methods may be left to the discretion of the educators, but the authors have utilized advocacy-inquiry techniques.10 This scenario may also be run as an oral board examination case. The residents are provided an electronic survey at the completion of the debriefing session to anonymously rate different aspects of the simulation, as well as provide qualitative feedback on the scenario. This survey is specific to the local institution's simulation center. Twenty learners completed a feedback form. This session received all 6 and 7 scores (consistently effective/very good and extremely effective/outstanding, respectively) other than one isolated 5 score. The lowest average score was 6.5 for, \"Before the simulation, the instructor set the stage for an engaging learning experience,\" and the highest average score was 6.84 for, \"The instructor identified what I did well or poorly - and why.\" Feedback from the residents was overwhelmingly positive (available upon request). All groups initially gave aspirin upon identification of the STEMI and several gave heparin. Debriefing topics included STEMI mimics, physical exam findings for aortic dissection, imaging and laboratory workup for aortic dissection, blood pressure and heart rate goals and pharmacologic management, uncomplicated STEMI management, and Type I versus Type II decision-making. This is an easily reproducible method for reviewing management of patients with aortic dissection. There are multiple potential presentations and complications of aortic dissections to further customize the experience for learners' needs. While it was discussed during debriefing that heparin administration was unlikely to cause immediate cardiopulmonary arrest, this state was included to reflect downstream hemorrhagic complications that may occur in the setting of antiplatelet administration for acute aortic dissection. Facilitators may choose to omit the arrest at their discretion.

    "title": "Acute Chest Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Emergency medicine residents and medical students on emergency medicine rotations. Acute chest syndrome is a life-threatening, potentially catastrophic complication of sickle cell disease.1,2 It occurs in approximately 50% of patients with sickle cell disease, with up to 13% all-cause mortality.1 Most common in children aged 2-4, up to 80% of patients with a prior diagnosis of acute chest syndrome will have recurrence of this syndrome.4 Diagnostic criteria include a new infiltrate on pulmonary imaging combined with any of the following: fever > 38.5°C (101.3°F), cough, wheezing, hypoxemia (PaO2 < 60 mm Hg), tachypnea, or chest pain.4,5 The pathophysiology of acute chest syndrome involves vaso-occlusion in pulmonary vessels resulting in hypoxia, release of inflammatory mediators, acidosis, and infarction of lung tissue. The most common precipitants are infections (viral or bacterial), rib infarction, and fat emboli.1,2,4 Patients commonly present with fever, dyspnea, cough, chills, chest pain, or hemoptysis. Diagnosis is made through physical exam, blood work, and chest imaging.1,2 Chest radiograph is considered the gold standard for imaging modality.3 Management of acute chest syndrome includes hydration with IV crystalloid solutions, antibiotics, judicious analgesia, oxygen, and, in severe cases, transfusion.6 Emergency medicine practitioners should keep acute chest syndrome as a cannot miss, high consequence differential diagnosis for all patients with sickle cell disease presenting to the Emergency Department. At the end of this oral board session, examinees will: 1) demonstrate the ability to obtain a complete medical history; 2) demonstrate the ability to perform a detailed physical examination in a patient with respiratory distress; 3) identify a patient with respiratory distress and hypoxia and manage appropriately (administer oxygen, place patient on monitor); 4) investigate the broad differential diagnoses which include acute chest syndrome, pneumonia, acute coronary syndrome, acute congestive heart failure, acute aortic dissection and acute pulmonary embolism; 5) list the appropriate laboratory and imaging studies to differentiate acute chest syndrome from other diagnoses (complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), lactic acid, procalcitonin, EKG, troponin level, d-dimer, chest radiograph); 6) identify a patient with acute chest syndrome and manage appropriately (administer intravenous pain medications, administer antibiotics after obtaining blood cultures, emergent consultation with hematology) and 7) provide appropriate disposition to the intensive care unit after consultation with hematology. This case is used as a method to assess learners' ability to rapidly assess a patient in respiratory distress. The learner needs to address a limited differential diagnosis list while simultaneously stabilizing and treating the patient. The \"patient\" becomes an active participant in the case, with repeated requests for pain medication, and appropriate analgesic administration is required as a critical action. For faculty, this case is used to assist with periodic assessment of resident performance while in the emergency department (ED).We use oral board testing as one additional tool to assess residents' critical thinking, while still applying the pressure that is needed to pass the oral certification examination. Large groups of residents can be assessed in short periods of time without needing to \"wait\" for this particular patient presentation to be seen in the ED.In this case, learners were assessed using a free online evaluation tool, Google forms. Multiple questions were written for each critical action, and the Google form served as the online evaluation and repository of this information. The critical actions of the case were then tied to Emergency Medicine Milestones, and the results were compiled for use during resident clinical competency evaluations. Residents were provided with immediate feedback of their performance and were also given their electronic evaluations when requested. To assess the strengths and weaknesses of the case, learners and instructors were given the opportunity to provide electronic feedback after the case was completed. Subsequent modifications were made based on the feedback provided. Additionally, learners answered written multiple-choice questions after the case to assess for retention of the material. Senior and junior residents alike enjoyed the process of an oral board simulation as an alternative to a more formal lecture. Seniors also stated that they felt more confident with their ability to pass the oral certification examination after having gone through oral board testing while in residency. Overall, the case was rated relatively highly, with residents scoring the case as 4.3 ± 0.186, 95% confidence interval (1-5 Likert scale, 5 being excellent, n=53) after their assessment was completed. Students and residents who participated in the oral board exam formatting found this to be preferable to a traditional lecture and enjoyed the learning environment. Faculty also found this type of participation to be more engaging and were pleased with the ability to perform high-stress assessments with low stakes. The content contained in the case is relevant to all emergency medicine trainees, and this formatting forces the learner to be an active participant in the learning session. The case is a good model for the high-stakes testing of the oral certification exam and is an effective way to test a resident's ability to rapidly assess and manage a life-threatening condition in the ED.

    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic dissection (TAD) is an uncommon but potentially fatal complication of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). Most patients present to the emergency room with severe chest pain, shortness of breath, or after a syncopal episode. Asymptomatic patients pose a challenge to diagnosis. The authors present a case of an 82-year-old male, who was found to have an incidental finding of a 5-cm ascending aortic aneurysm with an intimal dissection flap four months after CABG. Extensive workup on possible risk factors such as underlying aortic diseases, genetic conditions, and hypertensive crisis proved noncontributory. Aggressive blood pressure control was achieved, and the patient was observed in the intensive care unit before discharge with follow-up. The purpose of this case report is to alert clinicians of TAD after CABG and highlight the importance of developing a protocol for follow-up and monitoring of patients who have undergone CABG, as complications can be asymptomatic. Early and accurate diagnosis of TAD as a complication of CABG is essential to improving survival rates."

Salmonella aortitis can result in extensive tissue damage in the aorta leading to complications including dissection, abscess formation, pseudoaneurysms, and rupture, which require early diagnosis and treatment with both surgery and antibiotic therapy. We report a case of Salmonella aortitis complicated by Stanford type A aortic dissection. A 62-year-old man with a history of heroin use presented with chest pain, epigastric pain and vomiting. The computed tomography scan showed Stanford type A aortic dissection without malperfusion. At the time of surgery, an aortic dissection with purulent fluid and contained rupture was noted in the ascending aorta. Fluid culture was consistent with Salmonella. A composite valve-graft conduit aortic root replacement with ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement was performed. The patient recovered well and was discharged on long-term antibiotics. This rare case of a Stanford type A aortic dissection with contained rupture due to Salmonella aortitis was successfully treated with emergent surgery and antibiotic therapy."

    "title": "An Uncommon Presentation of Acute Thoracic Aortic Dissection.",
    "abstract": "We present a case of a 40-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of polysubstance abuse (cocaine and methamphetamine), who presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of intermittent cough with associated chest discomfort and shortness of breath for 2 weeks. Initial vital signs demonstrated borderline tachycardia (98 beats per minute), tachypnea (37 times per minutes), and hypoxia (oxygen saturation 89% on room air), and his physical exam was grossly unremarkable. A preliminary workup including a computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed a type A aortic dissection with both thoracic and abdominal involvement for which the patient was admitted. This patient had resection of the ascending aorta with graft placement, cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic root replacement using composite prosthesis and left and right coronary reconstruction and reimplantation and survived a complicated hospital course. This case demonstrates the classic association known to exist between recreational drug use, specifically stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines, and acute aortic dissection (AAD). However, such a presentation of borderline subacute, painless dissection in the setting of polysubstance use raises further questions, since uncommon AAD is typically found in higher-risk populations such as those with connective tissue disorders (Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome), bicuspid aortic valve, chronic hypertension, or previous aortic pathology. We therefore suggest clinicians strongly consider uncommon AAD as part of their differential diagnosis in patients with known or highly suspected polysubstance abuse."

    "abstract": "COVID-19 created a challenging situation for cardiac surgery and associated acute care programs around the world. While non-urgent cases might be postponed, operating on life-threatening conditions, including type A aortic dissection (TAAD), must be sustained despite the ongoing pandemic. Therefore, the authors investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their urgent aortic program. The authors included consecutive patients presenting with TAAD (n=36) in the years 2019 and 2020 [pre-pandemic period (2019; n=16) and the pandemic era (2020; n=20)] at a tertiary care centre. Patient characteristics, TAAD presenting symptoms, operative techniques, postoperative outcomes, and length of stay were determined retrospectively using chart review and were compared between both years. An increase occurred in the absolute number of TAAD referrals during the pandemic era. Patients were featured by younger age of presentation (pre-pandemic group: 47.6±18.7, and the pandemic group: 50.6±16.2 years, P=0.6) in contrast to Western data but showed similar male predominance (4:1) in both groups. There was no statistical difference in baseline comorbidities between the groups. Length of hospital stay [20 (10.8-56) vs. 14.5 (8.5-53.3) days, P=0.5] and intensive care unit stay [5 (2.3-14.5) vs. 5 (3.3-9.3) days, P=0.4] were comparable between both groups. Low rates of postoperative complications were registered in both groups with no significant between-group difference. There was no significant difference in the rates of in-hospital mortality between both groups [12.5% (2) vs. 10% (2), P=0.93]. Compared with the pre-pandemic era (2019), there was no difference in resource utilisation and clinical outcomes of patients presenting with TAAD during the first year of COVID-19 pandemic (2020). Structural departmental re-configuration and optimal personal protective equipment utilisation warrant maintained satisfactory outcomes in critical healthcare scenarios. Future studies are required to further investigate aortic care delivery during such challenging pandemics."

    "abstract": "The study objective was to evaluate the progression of dissected distal aorta in patients with acute type A aortic dissection with malperfusion syndrome treated with endovascular fenestration/stenting and delayed open aortic repair. From 1996 to 2021, 927 patients presented with acute type A aortic dissection. Of these, 534 had DeBakey I dissection with no malperfusion syndrome and underwent emergency open aortic repair (no malperfusion syndrome group), whereas 97 patients with malperfusion syndrome underwent fenestration/stenting and delayed open aortic repair (malperfusion syndrome group). Sixty-three patients with malperfusion syndrome treated with fenestration/stenting were excluded due to no open aortic repair, including death from organ failure (n = 31), death from aortic rupture (n = 16), and discharged alive (n = 16). Compared with the no malperfusion syndrome group, the malperfusion syndrome group had more patients with acute renal failure (60% vs 4.3%, P < .001). Both groups had similar aortic root and arch procedures. Postoperatively, the malperfusion syndrome group had similar operative mortality (5.2% vs 7.9%, P = .35) and permanent dialysis (4.7% vs 2.9%, P = .50), but more new-onset dialysis (22% vs 7.7%, P < .001) and prolonged ventilation (72% vs 49%, P < .001). The growth rate of the aortic arch (0.38 vs 0.35 mm/year, P = .81) was similar between the malperfusion syndrome and no malperfusion syndrome groups. The descending thoracic aorta growth rate (1.03 vs 0.68 mm/year, P = .001) and abdominal aorta growth rate (0.76 vs 0.59 mm/year, P = .02) were significantly higher in the malperfusion syndrome group. The cumulative incidence of reoperation over 10 years (18% vs 18%, P = .81) and 15-year survival outcome (50% vs 48%, P = .43) were similar between the malperfusion syndrome and no malperfusion syndrome groups. Endovascular fenestration/stenting followed by delayed open aortic repair was a valid approach for patients with malperfusion syndrome."

    "abstract": "Background To study the prevalence and types of hypertension-mediated organ damage and the prognosis of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with hypertensive emergencies. Methods and Results PubMed was queried from inception through November 30, 2021. Studies were included if they reported the prevalence or prognosis of hypertensive emergencies in patients presenting to the ED. Studies reporting data on hypertensive emergencies in other departments were excluded. The extracted data were arcsine transformed and pooled using a random-effects model. Fifteen studies (n=4370 patients) were included. Pooled analysis demonstrates that the prevalence of hypertensive emergencies was 0.5% (95% CI, 0.40%-0.70%) in all patients presenting to ED and 35.9% (95% CI, 26.7%-45.5%) among patients presenting in ED with hypertensive crisis. Ischemic stroke (28.1% [95% CI, 18.7%-38.6%]) was the most prevalent hypertension-mediated organ damage, followed by pulmonary edema/acute heart failure (24.1% [95% CI, 19.0%-29.7%]), hemorrhagic stroke (14.6% [95% CI, 9.9%-20.0%]), acute coronary syndrome (10.8% [95% CI, 7.3%-14.8%]), renal failure (8.0% [95% CI, 2.9%-15.5%]), subarachnoid hemorrhage (6.9% [95% CI, 3.9%-10.7%]), encephalopathy (6.1% [95% CI, 1.9%-12.4%]), and the least prevalent was aortic dissection (1.8% [95% CI, 1.1%-2.8%]). Prevalence of in-hospital mortality among patients with hypertensive emergency was 9.9% (95% CI, 1.4%-24.6%). Conclusions Our findings demonstrate a pattern of hypertension-mediated organ damage primarily affecting the brain and heart, substantial cardiovascular renal morbidity and mortality, as well as subsequent hospitalization in patients with hypertensive emergencies presenting to the ED."

    "abstract": "The development of the frozen elephant trunk (FET) prosthesis has revolutionised how we treat some of the most complex aortic pathology, including in the emergency setting of acute type A aortic dissection. The design of the prosthesis is fundamental to the success of the procedure in combination with the surgeon's skill in interpreting the pre-operative scan and procedural planning to juggling the technical aspects of the deployment and reimplantation of the supra-aortic vessels. Furthermore, organ protection strategies and techniques to reduce the complications of neurological and renal impairment are paramount. This article focuses on the Thoraflex Hybrid prosthesis including the evolution of the concept, design features unique to the device and surgical technique including fundamentals of sizing and implantation steps with illustrations. The Thoraflex Hybrid prosthesis provides an ergonomic and neat delivery system with a trusted gelatin coated surgical graft material making implantation and use as straightforward as possible. These features have meant that the device is a market leader in the field of FETs with outcome data and implant figures to support its efficacy globally. The success of the device is also reflected in the literature. For example, in the UK study from Mariscalco et al., the mortality of FET implantation in acute type A dissection, of which most were using the Thoraflex device, was only 12%. This is comparable to leading centres in Europe with the inherent advantage of improving long-term outcomes in addition. Of course, this strategy is not appropriate in all cases and precise judgement of when to deploy a FET in both the emergency and elective setting is key to achieving good outcomes."

A retrospective cohort of all patients who underwent emergency CT aortography from January 2007 through January 2012 for suspected AAS was assembled. A medical record survey tool was used to evaluate subsequent clinical events over 10 years of follow-up. Events included death, aortic dissection, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and pulmonary embolism. Coronary calcium scores were computed from original images using a validated simple 12-point ordinal method and categorized into none, low (1-3), moderate (4-6), or high (7-12) groupings. Survival analysis with Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard modeling was performed. The study cohort comprised 1658 patients (mean age, 60 years ± 16 [SD]; 944 women), with 595 (35.9%) developing a clinical event over a median follow-up of 6.9 years. Patients with high coronary calcium demonstrated the highest mortality rate (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.36; 95% CI: 1.65, 3.37). Patients with low coronary calcium demonstrated lower mortality, but rates were still almost twice as high compared with patients with no detectable calcium (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.89; 95% CI: 1.41, 2.53). Coronary calcium was a strong predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events (P < .001), which persisted after adjustment for common significant comorbidities. Patients with suspected AAS had a high rate of subsequent clinical events, including death. CT aortography-based coronary calcium scores strongly and independently predicted all-cause mortality.Keywords: Acute Aortic Syndrome, Coronary Artery Calcium, CT Aortography, Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events, Mortality Supplemental material is available for this article. © RSNA, 2023See also commentary by Weir-McCall and Shambrook in this issue."

We are presenting a case of pneumopericardium due to gastro-pericardial fistula secondary to gastric cancer presented with an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)-like picture. Our case is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history of metastatic gastric cancer status post chemotherapy and radiotherapy who presented to the emergency with acute onset severe burning chest pain with radiation to his back. He was diaphoretic, saturating 96% on room air, and hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/50 mmHg, and his EKG showed sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 60 BPM and ST elevation in inferior leads meeting STEMI criteria. The patient was transferred for an emergency coronary angiogram with possible percutaneous intervention. Surprisingly, no significant lesions in his epicardial vessels would corroborate his clinical presentation and EKG changes. The decision was to obtain CT angiography to exclude aortic dissection and pulmonary embolism. His CT chest revealed a large pneumopericardium with a gastric-pericardial fistula. A nasogastric tube was placed with suctioning of gastric contents. Given his tamponade physiology, it was decided to do emergent pericardiocentesis draining only 20 cc of gastric contents and a significant amount of air. After the procedure, the patient was transferred to the ICU with stable hemodynamics. The case was discussed with surgery, but given his inoperable cancer, a palliative team was involved. Acknowledging his very poor prognosis, the patient requested discharge to home with home hospice. As reported in the literature, pneumopericardium is rare, and gastro-pericardial fistula associated with gastric cancer is even rarer. Clinical presentation is variable and can be confusing. Providers should be aware of how a patient with gastric cancer can be complicated with pneumopericardium, and they should have a lower threshold of suspicion in patients having risk factors. CT scan is the most sensitive tool for diagnosis."

Retrospective review of a cohort of patients treated at a single tertiary referral center from 2015 to 2021. The primary end point was postoperative in-hospital mortality. Secondary end points were the duration of the procedure, duration of postoperative intensive care treatment, length of hospital stay, and the nature and severity of postoperative complications according to the Dindo-Clavien classification. A total of 34 patients underwent TEVAR for emergency indications. Twenty-two patients were treated for primary and twelve patients for secondary aortic pathologies. Concerning in-hospital mortality, no statistically significant difference could be observed between the primary and secondary aortic groups (27.3% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.711). Patients with an aortoesophageal fistula had a mortality rate of 66.7%. Postoperative morbidity (Dindo-Clavien > 3) was also not statistically significantly different between the primary and secondary aortic groups (36.4% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.86). Preoperative hemoglobin level (p < 0.001 for mortality, p = 0.002 for morbidity), hemoglobin level difference (p = 0.022, p = 0.032), postoperative creatinine level (p = 0.009, p = 0.035), and pre- and postoperative lactate levels (p < 0.001 for both mortality and morbidity) were found to be independent factors associated with postoperative mortality and morbidity (Dindo-Clavien > 3), respectively. The preoperative creatinine level was found to be associated with mortality (p = 0.024) but not morbidity. Morbidity and in-hospital mortality are still considerable after emergency TEVAR for both primary and secondary aortic indications. Pre- and postoperative levels of hemoglobin, creatinine, and lactate may be valuable to predict patient outcomes."

The aim of this study was to compare the early- and medium-term outcomes of patients undergoing a conservative approach extended only to the ascending aorta and the hemiarch to those of patients subjected to extensive surgery (total arch reconstruction and root replacement) across three European referral centers. A retrospective study was conducted across three sites between January 2008 and December 2021. In total, 601 patients were included within the study, of which 30% were female, and the median age was 64.4 years. The most common operation was ascending aorta replacement (n = 246, 40.9%). The aortic repair was extended proximally (i.e., root n = 105; 17.5%) and distally (i.e., arch n = 250; 41.6%). A more extensive approach, extending from the root to the arch, was employed in 24 patients (4.0%). Operative mortality occurred in 146 patients (24.3%), and the most common morbidity was stroke (75, 12.6%). An increased length of ICU admission was noted in the extensive surgery group, which comprised younger and more frequently male patients. No significant differences were noted in surgical mortality between patients managed with extensive surgery and those managed conservatively. However, age, arterial lactate levels, \"intubated/sedated\" status on arrival, and \"emergency or salvage\" status at presentation were independent predictors of mortality both within the index hospitalization and during the follow-up. The overall survival was similar between the groups."

    "abstract": "Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is becoming ubiquitous in emergency medicine. POCUS for abdominal aortic aneurysm is well established in practice. The thoracic aorta can also be assessed by POCUS for dissection and aneurysm and transthoracic echocardiography is endorsed by international guidelines as an initial test for thoracic aortic pathologies. A systematic search of Ovid Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS and Web of Science from January 2000 to August 2022 identified four studies evaluating diagnostic accuracy of emergency physician POCUS for thoracic aortic dissection (TAD) and five studies for thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA). Study designs were heterogeneous including differing diagnostic criteria for aortic pathology. Convenience recruitment was frequent in prospective studies. Sensitivity and specificity ranges for studies of TAD were 41-91% and 94-100%, respectively when an intimal flap was seen. Sensitivity and specificity ranges for studies of thoracic aorta dilation >40 mm were 50-100% and 93-100%, respectively; for >45 mm ranges were 64-65% and 95-99%. Literature review identified that POCUS is specific for TAD and TAA. POCUS reduces the time to diagnosis of thoracic aortic pathology; however, it remains insensitive and cannot be recommended as a stand-alone rule-out test. We suggest that detection of thoracic aorta dilation >40 mm by POCUS at any site increases the suspicion of serious aortic pathology. Studies incorporating algorithmic use of POCUS, Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score and D-dimer as decision tools are promising and may improve current ED practices. Further research is warranted in this rapidly evolving field."

    "title": "Urgent endovascular aorta repair for a rupture of a traumatic infrarenal aortic dissection: Case report and review of literature.",
    "abstract": "Traumatic aortic injury is a life-threatening condition usually followed by blunt trauma with damage at the thoracic aorta. Abdominal aortic injuries are rare and usually seen with seatbelt trauma. Timing and approach of treatment are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This case concerns a 66-year-old man with a high impact trauma after a fall from height. Upon presentation in our level two trauma center, he was conscious but hemodynamically unstable. Computer Tomography scan revealed multiple rib, spine and pelvic fractures with bilateral lung contusions warranting a transfer to a level one trauma center. However, an infrarenal aortic dissection with a retroperitoneal rupture and active bleeding necessitated acute surgical intervention. He was treated endovascularly with an off-the-shelf aortic stent graft which is meant for aortic aneurysm repair. Surgery was performed percutaneously under local anesthetic. Other fractures were treated conservatively. Postoperatively, the patient made a swift recovery without any complications in follow-up. As this case demonstrates, urgent endovascular repair of a traumatic infrarenal aortic injury can be done quickly with a minimally invasive approach with conventional stent graft systems thereby reducing the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with this life-threatening condition."

    "abstract": "Plain film abdomens (PFA) are frequently used in the emergency department to help guide the management of patients presenting with abdominal symptoms. A plain film abdomen contributes minimally to clinical scenarios due to low sensitivity and specificity. Is a PFA useful in the emergency setting or does it serve to further complicate decision making? We hypothesise that PFAs in the emergency department are over utilised to falsely reassure clinicians and patients alike. A search of the National Integrated Medical Imaging System (NIMIS) database in an Irish tertiary referral hospital was conducted. All plain film abdominal radiographs requested by the emergency department between 01/01/2022 and 31/08/2022 were identified. Requests where there was suspicion of foreign body were excluded. A retrospective search of the NIMIS database identified subjects who underwent subsequent imaging. A total of 619 abdominal films were deemed suitable for inclusion. These comprised of 338 male and 282 female subjects. Subjects had an average age of 64 years. Fifty-seven per cent of PFAs detected no abnormality. Forty-two per cent of subjects had subsequent imaging. The plain film findings correlated with further imaging in only 15% of cases. One case of ruptured aortic aneurysm and 11 perforations were detected on computerised tomography, none of these cases were evident on abdominal X-ray. Plain film abdomen requests are over utilised in the emergency department. PFAs are not sensitive for detecting acute pathology and should not be used to decide if a patient requires further imaging or a full clinical assessment."

    "abstract": "Patients with aortic emergencies, such as aortic dissection and rupture, are at risk of rapid deterioration, necessitating prompt diagnosis. This study introduces a novel automated screening model for computed tomography angiography (CTA) of patients with aortic emergencies, utilizing deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) algorithms. Our model (Model A) initially predicted the positions of the aorta in the original axial CTA images and extracted the sections containing the aorta from these images. Subsequently, it predicted whether the cropped images showed aortic lesions. To compare the predictive performance of Model A in identifying aortic emergencies, we also developed Model B, which directly predicted the presence or absence of aortic lesions in the original images. Ultimately, these models categorized patients based on the presence or absence of aortic emergencies, as determined by the number of consecutive images expected to show the lesion. The models were trained with 216 CTA scans and tested with 220 CTA scans. Model A demonstrated a higher area under the curve (AUC) for patient-level classification of aortic emergencies than Model B (0.995; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.990-1.000 vs. 0.972; 95% CI, 0.950-0.994, respectively; p = 0.013). Among patients with aortic emergencies, the AUC of Model A for patient-level classification of aortic emergencies involving the ascending aorta was 0.971 (95% CI, 0.931-1.000). The model utilizing DCNNs and cropped CTA images of the aorta effectively screened CTA scans of patients with aortic emergencies. This study would help develop a computer-aided triage system for CT scans, prioritizing the reading for patients requiring urgent care and ultimately promoting rapid responses to patients with aortic emergencies."

    "abstract": "Retrograde false lumen perfusion has limited the utility of aortic stent grafting for chronic aortic dissection. It is unknown whether balloon septal rupture can improve the outcomes for endovascular management of chronic aortic dissection. Included patients underwent false lumen obliteration and creation of a single-lumen aortic landing zone using balloon aortoplasty during thoracic endovascular aortic repair. The distal thoracic stent graft was sized to the total aortic lumen diameter, and septal rupture was performed within the stent graft with a compliant balloon in the region 5 cm proximal to the distal fabric edge. Clinical and radiographic outcomes are reported. Forty patients, with an average age 56 years, underwent thoracic endovascular aortic repair with septal rupture. Seventeen patients (43%) had chronic type B dissections, 17 of 40 patients (43%) had residual type A dissections, and 6 of 40 patients (15%) had acute type B dissections. Nine cases were emergency, complicated by rupture or malperfusion. Perioperative complications included 1 death (2.5%) due to rupture of the descending thoracic aorta and 2 (5%) instances each of stroke (neither permanent) and spinal cord ischemia (1 permanent). Two (5%) stent graft-induced new injuries were seen. Average postoperative computed tomography follow-up was 1.4 years. Thirteen patients (33%) had a decrease in aortic size, 25 of 39 patients (64%) were stable, and 1 of 39 patients (2.6%) had an increased aortic size. Partial and complete false lumen thrombosis were achieved in 10 of 39 patients (26%) and 29 of 39 patients (74%), respectively. Midterm aortic-related survival was 97.5% at an average of 1.6 years. Controlled balloon septal rupture offers an effective endovascular method to treat aortic dissection in the distal thoracic aorta."

We retrospectively analyzed patients who were diagnosed with AD and admitted to the emergency department from May 1, 2017 to May 1, 2022. Data was collected for variables including age, sex, clinical manifestation, past medical history, and laboratory test results. Twenty-five patients (2.61%, 22 type A and 3 type B) showed cerebral infarction as the primary presentation for acute AD, while another 933 AD patients (471 type A and 462 type B) who presented with other symptoms served as the control group. Eighteen of the 25 patients (72%) were initially diagnosed with stroke, and the diagnosis of AD was missed. However, patients with a missed diagnosis of AD did not have significantly different mortality to those in whom AD was diagnosed (chi-square test, p > 0.9999). Patients with cerebral infarction as the first presentation had a higher incidence of type A AD than the control patients (p = 0.0002), while their mortality rate was also higher than the control group of AD patients (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, patients with cerebral infarction as the first presentation were more likely to have multiple organ dysfunction. AD with an initial presentation of cerebral infarction is a rare condition with high mortality. However, the initial failure to diagnose AD does not further increase patient mortality."

Stanford type A aortic dissection is an emergent and serious cardiovascular disease characterized with an acute onset, poor prognosis, and high mortality. However, the incidences of postoperative complications are relatively higher due to the complexity of the disease and its intricate procedure. It has been considered that hypoxemia, one of the most common postoperative complications, plays an important role in having a worse clinical prognosis. Therefore, the effective intervention of postoperative hypoxemia is significant for the improved prognosis of patients with Stanford type A aortic dissection."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AD) involves the tearing of the aortic intima by shearing forces, resulting in a false lumen, which, depending on its location and extent, may lead to hemodynamic compromise, hypoperfusion of vital organs, or even rupture of the aorta. The classical presentation is a sudden chest or back pain described as sharp or ripping in quality. We present a 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension, Liddle's syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic cannabis use for insomnia who arrived at a non-PCI hospital complaining of severe retrosternal chest pain lasting several hours in evolution that started upon masturbation. The pain was ripping in character, starting retrosternally and radiating to his neck and back. After evidence of rising troponin values, he was initially diagnosed with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), managed with dual antiplatelet therapy with full anticoagulation, and subsequently transferred to our institution for further care. Shortly after his arrival at our hospital, he suddenly deteriorated with recurrent chest pain and hypotension, which triggered an emergent bedside echocardiogram evaluation. This revealed a hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion, moderate to severe aortic valve regurgitation (AR), and an intimal flap visualized on the ascending and descending aorta, suggestive of an extensive AD. A computerized tomographic angiogram confirmed the diagnosis of a Stanford type A AD that required an emergent surgical pericardiotomy, ascending aorta with partial arch replacement, and aortic valve repair. Often, AD may mimic an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or even present with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The appropriate diagnostic imaging evaluation prior to the initiation of anticoagulation therapy should be done in patients with higher-risk clinical criteria for AD to reduce adverse treatment outcomes. The use of a simple three-step diagnostic algorithm for acute aortic syndromes (AAS) may decrease diagnostic delays, misdiagnosis, and inappropriate therapies."

We hypothesized that a direct-to-operating room (DOR) transfer program for patients with TAAD would reduce time to intervention. A DOR program was started at an urban tertiary care hospital in February 2020. We performed a retrospective study of adult patients undergoing treatment for TAAD before (n = 42) and after (n = 84) implementation of DOR. Expected mortality was calculated using the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection risk prediction model. Median time from acceptance of transfer from emergency physician to operating room arrival was 1.37 h (82 min) faster in DOR compared to pre-DOR (1.93 h vs 3.30 h, p < 0.001). Median time from arrival to operating room was 1.14 h (72 min) faster after DOR compared to pre-DOR (0.17 h vs 1.31 h, p < 0.001). In-hospital mortality was 16.2% in pre-DOR, with an observed-to-expected (O/E) ratio of 1.03 (p = 0.24) and 12.0% in the DOR group, with an O/E ratio of 0.59 (p < 0.001). Creation of a DOR program resulted in decreased time to intervention. This was associated with a decrease in observed-to-expected operative mortality. The transfer of patients with acute type A aortic dissection to centers with direct-to-OR programs may result in decreased time from diagnosis to surgery."

Detection and urgent fixation or lung resection are critical to avoid catastrophic sequelae of lung necrosis, bronchopleural fistulae, and death. A case of lobar torsion following open repair of a type B aortic dissection and thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm in a patient with Marfan syndrome is presented. After a non-specific constellation of symptoms, the diagnosis was confirmed with computed tomography and bronchoscopic findings and the patient underwent detorsion and plication of a torted, yet viable, left upper lobe on post-operative day 6. The patient is currently being followed with serial imaging to follow a necrotic consolidation of the left upper lobe. This was a case of lobar torsion in a patient with Marfan syndrome and the degree of connective tissue disease may have predisposed the patient to this rare surgical complication. The case presents a challenging dilemma due to the risks associated with exposing a synthetic aortic graft to a potentially infected space if lobar resection or a pneumonectomy was performed."

This study aimed at discovering plasma metabolic markers with the potential to diagnose AD and clarifying the metabolic differences between two subtypes of AD. To facilitate the diagnosis of AD, we investigated the plasma metabolic profile by metabolomic approach. A total 482 human subjects were enrolled in the study: 80 patients with AD (50 with Stanford type A and 30 with Stanford type B), 198 coronary artery disease (CAD) patients, and 204 healthy individuals. Plasma samples were submitted to targeted metabolomic analysis. The partial least-squares discriminant analysis models were constructed to illustrate clear discrimination of AD patients with CAD patients and healthy control. Subsequently, the metabolites that were clinically relevant to the disturbances in AD were identified. Twenty metabolites induced the separation of AD patients and healthy control, 9 of which caused the separation of CAD patients and healthy control. There are 11 metabolites specifically down-regulated in AD group. Subgroup analysis showed that the levels of glycerol and uridine were dramatically lower in the plasma of patients with Stanford type A AD than those in the healthy control or Stanford type B AD groups. This study characterized metabolomic profiles specifically associated with the pathogenesis and development of AD. The findings of this research may potentially lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment of AD."

After arriving at the ED, she was hypoxic on her baseline supplemental O2 requirement and tachycardic and tachypneic. Computed tomography (CT) angiogram of the chest showed evidence of possible thoracic aortic dissection and bilateral PE. The patient was ultimately transported to a tertiary center for operative aortic repair and bilateral embolectomy and, fortunately, survived the procedures. Interestingly, during operative repair of the aorta, no obvious dissection flap was noted, but rather evidence of a limited tear in the intimal layer of the aorta. This is an interesting case as acute aortic injuries in the setting of COVID-19 infection have not been as widely documented as PE in the setting of COVID and highlight the need for further research on the possible association between them."

We analyze our experience with this high-risk cohort compared with the standard cohort. We identified consecutive patients undergoing descending thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair from 1997 to 2021. Patients with ACTBAD were compared with those having surgery for other reasons. Logistic regression was used to identify associations with major adverse events (MAEs). Five-year survival and competing risk of reintervention were calculated. Of 926 patients, 75 (8.1%) had ACTBAD. Indications included rupture (25/75), malperfusion (11/75), rapid expansion (26/75), recurrent pain (12/75), large aneurysm (5/75), and uncontrolled hypertension (1/75). The incidence of MAEs was similar (13.3% [10/75] vs 13.7% [117/851], P = .99). Operative mortality was 5.3% (4/75) vs 4.8% (41/851) (P = .99). Complications included tracheostomy (8%, 6/75), spinal cord ischemia (4%, 3/75), and new dialysis (2.7%, 2/75). Renal impairment, urgent/emergent operation, forced expiratory volume in 1 second ≤50%, and malperfusion were associated with MAEs, but not ACTBAD (odds ratio: 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.20-1.16], P = .1). At 5 and 10 years, there was no difference in survival (65.8% [95% CI: 54.6-79.2] vs 71.3% [95% CI: 67.9-74.9], P = .42, and 47.3% [95% CI: 34.5-64.7] vs 53.7% [95% CI: 49.3-58.4], P = .29, respectively) or 10-year reintervention (12.5% [95% CI: 4.3-25.3] vs 7.1% [95% CI: 4.7-10.1], P = .17, respectively). In an experienced center, open repair of ACTBAD can be performed with low rates of operative mortality and morbidity. Outcomes similar to elective repair are achievable even in high-risk patients with ACTBAD. In patients unsuitable for endovascular repair, transfer to a high-volume center experienced in open repair should be considered."

The purpose of the present study was to explore, firstly, whether TLR4-regulated immune signalling molecules were activated in TAAD patients and, secondly, whether TLR4-regulated inflammatory products interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and CC chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) could be a promising biomarker for diagnosis in patients with TAAD. Full-thickness ascending aortic wall specimens from TAAD patients (n = 12) and control donors (n = 12) were examined for the expression of TLR4 and its major signalling molecules, in terms of immunity and inflammation. Blood samples from TAAD (n = 49) and control patients (n = 53) were collected to detect the circulating plasma cytokine levels of IL-1β and CCL5. We demonstrated that expression levels of TLR4 and its downstream signalling cascade molecules were significantly elevated. Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic curve analyses showed that elevated IL-1β levels and decreased plasma CCL5 may have diagnostic value for TAAD. In summary, this current study suggests a more generalized pattern of inflammation in TAAD. In addition, TLR4-mediated inflammatory product, such as IL-1β and CCL5, could be novel and promising biomarkers with important diagnostic and predictive value in the identification of sporadic TAAD diseases."

    "title": "Framework Development for Patient-Specific Compliant Aortic Dissection Phantom Model Fabrication: Magnetic Resonance Imaging Validation and Deep-Learning Segmentation.",
    "abstract": "Type B aortic dissection is a life-threatening medical emergency that can result in rupture of the aorta. Due to the complexity of patient-specific characteristics, only limited information on flow patterns in dissected aortas has been reported in the literature. Leveraging the medical imaging data for patient-specific in vitro modeling can complement the hemodynamic understanding of aortic dissections. We propose a new approach toward fully automated patient-specific type B aortic dissection model fabrication. Our framework uses a novel deep-learning-based segmentation for negative mold manufacturing. Deep-learning architectures were trained on a dataset of 15 unique computed tomography scans of dissection subjects and were blind-tested on 4 sets of scans, which were targeted for fabrication. Following segmentation, the three-dimensional models were created and printed using polyvinyl alcohol. These models were then coated with latex to create compliant patient-specific phantom models. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) structural images demonstrate the ability of the introduced manufacturing technique for creating intimal septum walls and tears based on patient-specific anatomy. The in vitro experiments show the fabricated phantoms generate physiologically-accurate pressure results. The deep-learning models also show high similarity metrics between manual segmentation and autosegmentation where Dice metric is as high as 0.86. The proposed deep-learning-based negative mold manufacturing method facilitates an inexpensive, reproducible, and physiologically-accurate patient-specific phantom model fabrication suitable for aortic dissection flow modeling."

    "title": "Onset of pain to surgery time in acute aortic dissections type A: a mandatory factor for evaluating surgical results?",
    "abstract": "An acute aortic dissection type A (AADA) is a rare but life-threatening event. The mortality rate ranges between 18% to 28% and mortality is often within the first 24 h and up to 1%-2% per hour. Although the onset of pain to surgery time has not been a relevant factor in terms of research in the field of AADA, we hypothesize that a patient's preoperative conditions depend on the length of this time. Between January 2000 and January 2018, 430 patients received surgical treatment for acute aortic dissection DeBakey type I at our tertiary referral hospital. In 11 patients, the exact time point of initial onset of pain was retrospectively not detectable. Accordingly, a total of 419 patients were included in the study. The cohort was categorized into two groups: Group A with an onset of pain to surgery time < 6 h (n = 211) and Group B > 6 h (n = 208), respectively. Median age was 63.5 years (y) ((IQR: 53.3-71.4 y); (67.5% male)). Preoperative conditions differed significantly between the cohorts. Differences were detected in terms of malperfusion (A: 39.3%; B: 23.6%; P: 0.001), neurological symptoms (A: 24.2%; B: 15.4%; P: 0.024), and the dissection of supra-aortic arteries (A: 25.1%; B: 16.8%; P: 0.037). In particular, cerebral malperfusion (A 15.2%: B: 8.2%; P: 0.026) and limb malperfusion (A: 18%, B: 10.1%; P: 0.020) were significantly increased in Group A. Furthermore, Group A showed a decreased median survival time (A: 1,359.0 d; B: 2,247.5 d; P: 0.001), extended ventilation time (A: 53.0 h; B: 44.0 h; P: 0.249) and higher 30-day mortality rate (A: 25.1%; B: 17.3%; P: 0.051). Patients with a short onset of pain to surgery time in cases of AADA present themselves not only with more severe preoperative symptoms but are also the more compromised cohort. Despite early presentation and emergency aortic repair, these patients show increased chances of early mortality. The \"onset of pain to surgery time\" should become a mandatory factor when making comparable surgical evaluations in the field of AADA."

    "abstract": "To compare operative and long-term outcomes between patients with and without Marfan syndrome undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair. We identified all consecutive patients undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair between 1997 and 2022. Primary outcome was composite of major adverse events. Secondary outcomes were individual complications and long-term survival. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was performed. Weighted Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate long-term survival. Multivariable analysis identified factors associated with major adverse events. Six hundred eighty-four patients underwent open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Ninety (13.1%) had Marfan syndrome, whereas 594 (86.9%) did not. Marfan patients were younger (46 years [range, 36-56 years] vs 69 years [range, 61-76 years]; P < .001). Extent II or III aneurysms (57 out of 90 [63.3%] vs 211 out of 594 [35.6%]; P < .001) and type I or III chronic dissection (77 out of 90 [85.3%] vs 242 out of 594 [40.8%]; P < .001) were more common. Cardiovascular risk factors were less frequent in Marfan patients. There was no difference in major adverse events between groups (12 out of 90 [13.3%] vs 100 out of 594 [16.8%]; P = .49). Operative mortality was similar between groups (3 out of 90 [3.3%] vs 28 out of 594 [4.7%]; P = .75). Unweighted survival at 10 years was 78.7% vs 46.8% (P = .001). Weighted Kaplan-Meier curves showed no difference in long-term survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.32-1.99; P = .62; Log-rank P = .12). At multivariable analysis, renal insufficiency (odds ratio, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.43-3.68; P < .01) and urgent/emergency procedure (odds ratio, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.35-3.48; P < .01) were associated with major adverse events, whereas Marfan syndrome was not (odds ratio, 1.56; 95% CI, 0.69-3.49; P = .28). Open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair can be performed with similar operative outcomes in patients with and without Marfan syndrome despite differing risk profiles. Operative/perioperative strategies must be tailored to specific needs of each patient to optimize outcomes."

    "title": "Outcomes of Secondary Endovascular Aortic Repair After Frozen Elephant Trunk.",
    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the midterm outcomes of secondary extension of frozen elephant trunk (FET) by means of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). This single-center prospective study was conducted in a tertiary aortic center on consecutive patients having undergone TEVAR with an endograft covering most of the 10 cm FET module with 2 to 4 mm oversizing. All patients were monitored by computerized tomography angiography (CTA) at sixth month and yearly thereafter. From January 2015 to July 2022, among 159 patients who received FET, 30 patients (18.8%) underwent a TEVAR procedure (13 for a thoracoabdominal aneurysm, 11 for a chronic aortic dissection and 6 for an emergency procedure). All connections were successfully achieved with 2 postoperative deaths (6.6%) and 1 paraplegia (3.3%). At a median follow-up of 21 months (interquartile range [IQR], 4.2-34.7), 5 patients (25%) required a fenestrated-branched endovascular aortic repair (F-BEVAR) extension followed by 4 patients with 5 reinterventions, 3 for a Type 3 endoleak due to disconnection between FET and TEVAR endograft, and 2 unrelated to the FET for a secondary Type 1C endoleak. All reinterventions were successful, without mortality or morbidity. In this series, FET connection with a TEVAR endograft was effective with low postoperative morbidity but with a risk of aortic reintervention related to disconnection between the FET and TEVAR endograft. These results suggest the need for annual CTA monitoring with no time limit in patients following connection of the FET with a TEVAR endograft. In this series of 30 patients, midterm outcomes of secondary extension of frozen elephant trunk (FET) by thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) showed 3 disconnections (10%) with a Type 3 endoleak between FET and TEVAR. These findings suggest the need for annual CTA monitoring with no time limit. But so far, only a few studies provide some information after one year while the risk of disconnection increases over time and becomes a concern after 3 years. This is the new message brought by our study."

    "abstract": "The emergency room is a very potent environment in the hospital. With the growing demands of the population, improved accessibility to health resources, and the onslaught of the triple pandemic, it is extremely crucial to triage patients at presentation. In the spectrum of complaints, chest pain is the commonest. Despite it being a daily ailment, chest pain brings concern to every physician at first. Chest pain could span from acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, and aortic dissection (all potentially fatal) to reflux, zoster, or musculoskeletal causes that do not need rapid interventions. We often employ scoring systems such as GRACE/PURSUIT/TIMI to assist in clinical decision-making. Over the years, the HEART score became a popular and effective tool for predicting the risk of 30-d major adverse cardiovascular events. Recently, a new scoring system called SVEAT was developed and compared to the HEART score. We have attempted to summarize how these scoring systems differ and their generalizability. With an increasing number of scoring systems being introduced, one must also prevent anchorage bias; i.e., tools such as these are only diagnosis-specific and not organ-specific, and other emergent differential diagnoses must also be kept in mind before discharging the patient home without additional workup."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the predictive effect of preoperative and postoperative interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels on the duration of mechanical ventilation in patients with acute DeBakey Type I aortic dissection (I-AAD) after emergency surgery. We retrospectively enrolled 381 patients with I-AAD who underwent surgery in our hospital, between June 2018 and June 2022. Patients were divided into two groups according to whether prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) occurred after surgery. The baseline data, biochemical indicators at admission, surgical data, biochemical indicators at postoperative 6 h, and the postoperative data of the two groups were recorded and analyzed. The PMV group comprised 199 patients, and the non-PMV group 182. The postoperative in-hospital mortality was different between the two groups (11.1% vs. 3.3%, p = 0.004). The length of intensive care unit and hospitalization time in the PMV group were significantly longer than those in the non-PMV group. Multiple regression analysis showed postoperative IL-6 (post-IL-6) ≥67.1 pg/mL and summation of preoperative and postoperative IL-6 (total IL-6) ≥83.4 pg/mL were associated risk factors for PMV [odds ratio (OR) 3.259, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.922-5.524, p < 0.001], [(OR) 4.515, 95% CI 2.241-9.098, p < 0.001]. Furthermore, determined by the receiver operating characteristics(ROC) curve, the cut-off point was total IL-6 ≥83.4 pg/mL (area under curve(AUC) = 0.825). The sensitivity and specificity of predicting postoperative PMV of patients with I-AAD were 91.5% and 78.2%, respectively (95% CI 0.782-0.868, p < 0.001). For predicting postoperative PMV in patients with I-AAD, post IL-6 ≥67.1 pg/mL is potentially valuable and summation of preoperative and postoperative IL-6 (total IL-6) ≥83.4 pg/mL has a more pronounced predictive value."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection occurs following a tear in the tunica intima of the aortic wall resulting in blood entering between the intima and media. Type A aortic dissection can rarely manifest as upper limb malperfusion. This is regarding a patient who presented with intermittent malperfusion of the bilateral upper limbs and was initially managed as acute limb ischemia. An attempt of embolectomy didn't yield any clots. Urgent imaging with computed tomography angiogram of bilateral upper limbs revealed type A aortic dissection (TAAD). TAAD is a surgical emergency which can rarely manifest as intermittent malperfusion of upper limbs. This could be explained by the dissection flap's dynamic obstruction of the right brachiocephalic trunk and left subclavian artery. In patients with a discrepancy in pulse between both limbs or intermittent ischemia of limbs, aortic dissection should be considered a differential diagnosis."

Failure to make a timely diagnosis may result in unscheduled ED revisits and severe outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the risk factors associated with potentially missed acute CV emergencies. This retrospective study enrolled adult patients who presented with chest pain and returned to the ED within 72 h. Demographic information, pre-existing medical conditions, chief complaints, triage level and vital signs, electrocardiography (ECG) reports, and laboratory data were collected from medical charts by independent physicians. The primary outcome was the diagnosis of acute CV diseases, including ACS, pulmonary embolism, unstable arrhythmia, acute decompensated heart failure, and aortic dissection. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the association between variables and acute CV emergencies. A total of 453 eligible patients were included, with 60 (13.2%) patients diagnosed as acute CV emergencies at the ED revisit. Risk factors for acute CV emergencies included male gender (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.17-6.25), abnormal ECG rhythm (aOR = 10.33, 95% CI = 4.68-22.83), and abnormal changes in high sensitivity Troponin-T (hs-cTnT) during sequential follow-up (aOR = 6.52, 95% CI = 2.19-19.45). Male gender, abnormal ECG rhythm, and a significant increase in sequential follow-up hs-cTnT levels were identified as significant risk factors for acute CV emergencies.

    "abstract": "Thyroid storm is a rare but serious condition that carries a high rate of morbidity and even mortality. This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of thyroid storm, including presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence. Thyroid storm is a challenging condition to diagnose and manage in the ED. It is characterized by exaggerated signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis and evidence of multiorgan decompensation, usually occurring in the presence of an inciting trigger. Clinical features of thyroid storm may include fever, tachycardia, signs of congestive heart failure, vomiting/diarrhea, hepatic dysfunction, and central nervous system disturbance. There are several mimics including sympathomimetic overdose, substance use disorders, alcohol withdrawal, acute pulmonary edema, aortic dissection, heat stroke, serotonin syndrome, and sepsis/septic shock. Ultimately, the key to diagnosis is considering the disease. While laboratory assessment can assist, there is no single laboratory value that will establish a diagnosis of thyroid storm. Clinical criteria include the Burch-Wartofsky point scale and Japan Thyroid Association diagnostic criteria. ED treatment focuses on diagnosing and managing the trigger; resuscitation; administration of steroids, thionamides, iodine, and cholestyramine; and treatment of hyperthermia and agitation. Beta blockers should be administered in the absence of severe heart failure. The emergency clinician should be prepared for rapid clinical deterioration and employ a multidisciplinary approach to treatment that involves critical care and endocrinology specialists. An understanding of thyroid storm can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this potentially deadly disease."

Registry data have noted several sex-specific differences in presentation with TAAAD which may account for the differences in men and women undergoing surgery for this condition. A retrospective review of data from three departments of cardiac surgery (Centre Cardiologique du Nord, Henri-Mondor University Hospital, San Martino University Hospital, Genoa) between January 2005 and 31 December 2021 was conducted. Confounders were adjusted using doubly robust regression models, a combination of regression models with inverse probability treatment weighting by propensity score. 633 patients were included in the study, of which 192 (30.3%) were women. Women were significantly older with reduced haemoglobin levels and pre-operative estimated glomerular filtration rate compared to men. Male patients were more likely to undergo aortic root replacement and partial or total arch repair. Operative mortality (OR 0.745, 95% CI: 0.491-1.130) and early postoperative neurological complication results were comparable between the groups. The adjusted survival curves using IPTW by propensity score confirmed the absence of a significant impact of gender on long-term survival (HR 0.883, 95% CI 0.561-1.198). In a subgroup analysis of women, preoperative levels of arterial lactate (OR 1.468, 95% CI: 1.133-1.901) and mesenteric ischemia after surgery (OR 32.742, 95% CI: 3.361-319.017) were significantly associated with increased operative mortality. The advancing age of female patients alongside raised preoperative level of arterial lactate may account for the increasing preponderance among surgeons to perform more conservative surgery compared to their younger male counterparts although postoperative survival was similar between the groups."

The diagnostic and prognostic role of CCT has been demonstrated by various randomized trials to such an extent that it has been included as a Class I, level of evidence B recommendation in the latest European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the diagnosis of chronic coronary syndrome in patients at intermediate-low cardiovascular risk. In addition to the anatomical evaluation, the CCT allows to evaluate the presence of high-risk characteristics of the atherosclerotic plaque (napkin-ring sign, positive remodelling, spotty calcification, and low-attenuation plaque), thus discriminating the stability of the atheromatous pathology. Furthermore, among the potential of cardiac CT in the emergency department, the possibility of making a triple rule-out must be underlined, excluding three potential big killers as the cause of acute chest pain: acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, and aortic dissection. Various randomized clinical studies have demonstrated that the prognosis of the patient with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) improves only if a haemodynamically significant stenosis is treated, generally investigated with invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR); CCT technological advances have made it possible to create an algorithm for calculating the FFR-CT, an index of haemodynamic significance of coronary stenosis, whose correlation with the invasive FFR data and, consequently, with the prognosis has been demonstrated of patients with CAD."

According to the start time of surgery, patients were divided into daytime group (06:01 a.m. to 06:00 p.m.) and night-time group (06:01 p.m. to 06:00 a.m.), and retrospective analyses were performed between them. The operative mortality of night-time group (12.2%, 43/352) was dramatically higher than daytime group (6.9%, 115/1663; p = 0.001). There was significant difference between night-time and daytime groups in terms of 30-days mortality (5.8% vs 10.8%; p = 0.001) and in-hospital mortality (3.5% vs 6.0%; p = 0.03). The night-time group had a longer duration of intensive care unit stay (4 vs two; days; p < 0.001) and ventilation support (34 vs 19; hours; p < 0.001), compared with daytime group. The risk factors for operative mortality were night-time surgery (odds ratio [OR], 1.545; p = 0.027), age (odds ratio, 1.152; p < 0.001), total arch replacement (OR, 2.265; p < 0.001) and previous aortic surgery (OR, 2.376; p = 0.003). Night-time surgical repair may be associated with higher operative mortality of patients with TAAD. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to offer emergency surgery at night-time for such patients who were more likely to present disastrous complications with delayed surgical intervention, as outcomes indicate acceptable operative mortality."

    "abstract": "Left subclavian artery (LSA) revascularization during thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is necessary to reduce postoperative complications in patients with Stanford type B aortic dissection and an insufficient proximal anchoring area. However, the efficacy and safety of different LSA revascularization strategies remain unclear. Here, we compared these strategies to provide a clinical basis for selecting an appropriate LSA revascularization method. In this study, we included 105 patients with type B aortic dissection who were treated using TEVAR combined with LSA reconstruction in the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University from March 2013 to 2020. They were divided into four groups according to the method used for LSA reconstruction, namely, carotid subclavian bypass (CSB; n = 41), chimney graft (CG; n = 29), single-branched stent graft (SBSG; n = 21), and physician-made fenestration (PMF; n = 14) groups. Finally, we collected and analyzed the baseline, perioperative, operative, postoperative, and follow-up data of the patients. The treatment success rate was 100% in all the groups, and CSB + TEVAR was the most commonly used procedure in emergency settings compared with the other three procedures (P < 0.05). The estimated blood loss, contrast agent volume, fluoroscopic time, operation time, and limb ischemia symptoms during the follow-up were significantly different in the four groups (P < 0.05). Pairwise comparison among groups indicated that the estimated blood loss and operation time in the CSB group were the highest (adjusted P < 0.0083; P < 0.05). The contrast agent volume and fluoroscopy duration were the highest in the SBSG groups, followed by PMF, CG, and CSB groups. The incidence of limb ischemia symptoms was the highest in the PMF group (28.6%) during the follow-up. The incidence of complications (except limb ischemia symptoms) during the perioperative and follow-up periods was similar among the four groups (P > 0.05) The median follow-up time of CSB, CG, SBSG, and PMF groups was significantly different (P < 0.05), and the CSB group had the longest follow-up. Our single-center experience suggested that the PMF technique increased the risk of limb ischemia symptoms. The other three strategies effectively and safely restored LSA perfusion in patients with type B aortic dissection and had comparable complications. Overall, different LSA revascularization techniques have their advantages and disadvantages."

    "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the treatment and maternal and fetal outcomes of pregnant women with aortic dissection (AD). Methods: The clinical data of 11 pregnant women with AD treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Air Force Military Medical University from January 1st, 2011 to August 1st, 2022 were collected, and their clinical characteristics, treatment plans and maternal and fetal outcomes were analyzed retrospectively. Results: (1) Clinical characteristics: the age of onset of 11 pregnant women with AD was (30±5) years old, and the week of pregnancy of onset was (31.4±8.0) weeks. Clinical manifestations: the main symptoms were sudden onset of chest and back pain or low back pain. Type of AD: 8 cases of Stanford type A, and 3 cases of type B. The aortic width was (42±11) mm. Diagnostic methods: the diagnosis of AD was confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), computed tomography angiography (CTA) or enhanced CT examination, among which 4 cases were confirmed by CTA examination, 4 cases by TTE examination, and 3 cases by enhanced CT examination. Laboratory results: white blood cell count was (15.4±8.7) ×109/L, neutrophil count was (13.5±8.5) ×109/L, the median D-dimer level was 2.7 mg/L (2.1-9.2 mg/L), and the median fibrin degradation products level was 12.0 mg/L (5.4-36.1 mg/L). (2) Treatments: all 11 patients were admitted to hospital in emergency. Before operation, the departments of cardiac surgery, obstetrics, pediatrics and anesthesiology cooperated to develop individualized treatment plan. Aortic surgery was performed in 11 pregnant women with AD. In 6 of them, pregnancy termination was performed at the same time as aortic surgery, and aortic surgery was performed after cesarean section. Four cases of pregnancy termination and aortic operation were performed by stages, including aortic operation after cesarean section in 2 cases, and cesarean section after aortic operation in 2 cases. One case (12+6 weeks of gestation) had spontaneous abortion on the day after aortic surgery. The gestational age of the 11 patients on pregnancy termination was (32.9±7.4) weeks. Aorta surgical methods: 7 patients received under extracorporeal circulation ascending aorta replacement ± aortic valve replacement ± coronary artery transplantation (or coronary artery bypass transplantation)± left and right coronary Cabrol + total arch replacement (or aortic arch replacement)± stent implantation, 1 patient received under extracorporeal circulation aortic root replacement, and 3 patients underwent aortic endoluminal isolation. (3) Maternal and fetal outcomes: among the 11 pregnant women with AD, 9 (9/11) survived, 2 (2/11) died with lower limb ischemia before the onset of the disease. A total of 10 newborns were born in 9 pregnant women after delivery (1 of them was twins), and the 2 cases were spontaneous abortion after aortic surgery in the first trimester (12+6 weeks) and fetal death after hysterotomy in the second trimester (26+3 weeks), respectively. Among the 10 surviving neonates, 3 were full-term infants and 7 were premature infants. The birth weight of newborn was (2 651±784) g. Respiratory distress syndrome was found in 6 cases. The newborns were followed up for (5.6±3.6) years after birth, and the infants developed well during the follow-up period. Conclusions: Pregnancy complicated with AD is dangerous, and chest and back pain is the main clinical manifestation of this disease. With early identification and selection of appropriate diagnostic methods, multidisciplinary diagnosis and treatment, mother and children could obtain good outcomes. 目的： 探讨妊娠合并主动脉夹层（AD）孕妇的治疗及母儿结局。 方法： 收集2011年1月1日至2022年8月1日空军军医大学第一附属医院收治的11例妊娠合并AD孕妇的临床资料及随访资料，回顾性分析其临床特点、治疗方案及母儿结局。 结果： （1）临床特点：11例妊娠合并AD孕妇的发病年龄为（30±5）岁，发病孕周为孕（31.4±8.0）周；临床表现：主要症状为突发胸背部疼痛或腰背部疼痛；AD分型：Stanford A型8例，B型3例；主动脉宽度为（42±11）mm。诊断方法：均通过经胸壁超声心动图（TTE）、计算机断层扫描血管造影（CTA）或增强CT检查明确AD的诊断，其中4例CTA检查、4例TTE检查、3例增强CT检查确诊。实验室检查结果：白细胞计数为（15.4±8.7）×109/L，中性粒细胞计数为（13.5±8.5）×109/L；中位D-二聚体水平为2.7 mg/L（2.1~9.2 mg/L），中位纤维蛋白降解产物水平为12.0 mg/L（5.4~36.1 mg/L）。（2）治疗：11例妊娠合并AD孕妇均急诊入院，术前心外科、产科、儿科、麻醉科协作制定个体化治疗方案。11例妊娠合并AD孕妇均行主动脉手术，其中6例终止妊娠与主动脉手术同期进行，且均先行剖宫产术再行主动脉手术；4例终止妊娠与主动脉手术分期进行，其中2例剖宫产术后行主动脉手术、2例主动脉手术后行剖宫产术；1例（孕12+6周）主动脉手术后当天自然流产。11例妊娠合并AD孕妇的终止妊娠孕周为孕（32.9±7.4）周。主动脉手术方式：7例行体外循环下升主动脉置换±主动脉瓣置换±冠状动脉移植（或冠状动脉旁路移植）±左右冠状动脉Cabrol分流+全弓置换（或主动脉弓置换）±支架置入术，1例行体外循环下主动脉根部置换术，3例行主动脉腔内隔绝术。（3）母儿结局：11例妊娠合并AD孕妇中，9例（9/11）孕妇存活，2例（2/11）死亡，死亡的2例孕妇发病前均有双下肢缺血表现；9例孕妇分娩后共获新生儿10例（其中1例为双胎），2例分别为孕早期（孕12+6周）主动脉手术后自然流产、孕中期（孕26+3周）剖宫取胎术后胎儿死亡。10例新生儿中，3例为足月儿，7例为早产儿；新生儿出生体重为（2 651±784）g；其中6例出现呼吸窘迫综合征。新生儿出生后随访（5.6±3.6）年，随访期内婴幼儿发育良好。 结论： 妊娠合并AD发病凶险，胸背部疼痛为其主要临床表现，尽早识别并选择合适的诊断方法，多学科协作诊治，母儿可获得良好结局。."

    "abstract": "Thoracoabdominal acute aortic syndrome is associated with high morbidity and mortality. We aim to scrutinize our evolving strategies for acute aortic syndrome (AAS) management using minimally invasive and adaptive surgical techniques over two decades. This is a longitudinal observational study at our tertiary vascular centre from 2002 to 2021. Out of 22,349 aortic referrals, we performed 1,555 aortic interventions over twenty years. Amongst 96 presented with symptomatic aortic thoracic pathology, 71 patients had AAS. Our primary endpoint is combined aneurysm-related and cardiovascular-related mortality. There were 43 males and 28 females (5 Traumatic Aortic Transection (TAT), 8 Acute Aortic Intramural Hematoma (IMH), 27 Symptomatic Aortic Dissection (SAD) and 31 Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm (TAA) post-SAD) with a mean age of 69. All the patients with AAS received optimal medical therapy (OMT), but TAT patients underwent emergency thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). Fifty-eight patients had an aortic dissection, of which 31 developed TAA. These 31 patients with SAD and TAA received OMT initially and interval surgical intervention with TEVAR or sTaged hybrId sinGle lumEn Reconstruction (TIGER). To increase our landing area, we performed a left subclavian chimney graft with TEVAR in twelve patients. The average follow-up duration was 78.2 months, and eleven patients (15.5%) had combined aneurysm and cardiovascular-related mortality. Twenty-six percentage of the patients developed endoleaks (EL), of which 15% required re-intervention for type II and III. Four patients who had paraplegia (5.7%) and developed renal failure died. None of our patients had a stroke or bowel ischaemia. Twenty patients had OMT, eight of these were patients with acute aortic hematoma, and all eight died within 30 days of presentation. Acute aortic hematoma is a sinister finding, which must be closely monitored, and consideration is given to early intervention. Paraplegia and renal failure result in an increased mortality rate. TIGER technique with interval TEVAR has salvaged complex situations in young patients. Left subclavian chimney increases our landing area and abolishes SINE. Our experience shows that minimally invasive techniques could be a viable option for AAS."

    "abstract": "Type-A acute aortic dissection (AAD) with acute coronary involvement can be instantly fatal. The patient's haemodynamics can easily collapse, so rapid decisions regarding treatment strategy are essential. A 76-year-old man requested an ambulance because of sudden back pain and paraplegia. He was admitted to the emergency room with cardiogenic shock due to acute myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation. Computed tomography angiography revealed a thrombosed AAD from the ascending to the distal aorta after the renal artery bifurcation, suggesting a retrograde DeBakey type IIIb (DeBakey IIIb + r, Stanford type-A) dissection. He suddenly developed ventricular fibrillation with cardiac arrest and haemodynamic collapse. We thus performed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and thoracic endovascular aortic repair under percutaneous cardiopulmonary support (PCPS). Percutaneous cardiopulmonary support and respiratory support were withdrawn 5 and 12 days after admission, respectively. The patient was transferred to the general ward on Day 28; he was eventually discharged to a rehabilitation hospital on Day 60, having recovered completely. Immediate decisions regarding treatment strategy are essential. Non-invasive emergent treatment strategies (such as PCI and TEVAR under PCPS) may be options for critically ill patients with type-A AAD."

The data of 114 TB-AD patients without PACI were collected as the control group retrospectively. The medical history, surgery-related indicators, general data, imaging data and laboratory test results (D-dimer (D-D), preoperative serum creatinine and preoperative white blood cell count) were compared. Then, logistic regression was applied to analyze risk factors for PACI in TB-AD patients. The surgery time, blood loss and hospital stay of patients in the PACI group were determined to be obviously higher/longer when comparing to those in the control group. Aortic arch radius of curvature and length of proximal anchoring zone showed no significant difference between the two groups. Pearson correlation analysis indicated that D-D level after surgery was positively related to white blood cell count and serum creatinine level in TB-AD patients. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that operation time, emergency surgery, preoperative D-D and preoperative serum creatinine level were independent risk factors for PACI after EVAR in the patients with TB-AD (P < 0.05). There are many independent risk factors for PACI after EVAR in patients with TB-AD, and preoperative D-D level and serum creatinine level should be given attention."

A systematic literature search of major databases was conducted on human studies investigating the diagnostic accuracy of TTE for proximal aortic dissection. The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. The quality of studies was evaluated using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool. Data were gathered for the following sonographic findings: intimal flap, tear, or intramural hematoma; enlargement of aortic root or widening of aortic walls; aortic valve regurgitation; or pericardial effusion. Sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio, number needed to diagnose values, and likelihood ratios were determined. Fourteen studies were included in our final analysis. More than half of the included studies demonstrated low risk of bias. The identification of intimal flap, tear, or intramural hematoma was shown to have an exceptional ability as a diagnostic tool to rule in proximal aortic dissections. TTE should be considered during the initial evaluation of patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected proximal aortic dissection. Positive sonographic findings on TTE may aid in rapid assessment, coordination of care, and treatment of individuals awaiting advanced imaging."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a life-threatening pathological change of the aorta. Patients who have undergone aortic surgery are usually at high risk of mortality. We investigated the predictive value of serum Mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 (MST1) as a biomarker for the risk of mortality of ATAAD patients. In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed 160 consecutive ATAAD patients who had undergone emergency surgery from July 2016 to April 2017. Medical records and blood samples were collected and analyzed. ELISA assays were performed to detect the concentrations of several proteins including MST1. The relationship between these potential biomarkers and the primary endpoint of death was evaluated using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. Compared with a low level (< 1330.8 ng/L), high serum MST1 level (≥ 1330.8 ng/L) was positively associated with the 30-day mortality (OR = 5.233, 95%CI, 1.843-14.862, P < 0.01) and retained predictive after adjustment for sex, age, BMI, nasopharyngeal temperature and deep hypothermia circulatory arrest time (OR = 4.628 95% CI, 1.572-13.625, P < 0.01). A pre-existing basic clinical prediction model was improved with the inclusion of preoperative serum MST1. Specifically, the area under the ROC curve for base model (history of cerebrovascular disease, creatinine, time of operation) was 0.708 (95%CI, 0.546-0.836) and markedly increased to 0.823 when taking MST1 into consideration (95%CI, 0.700-0.912, P = 0.02). Our study suggests that high preoperative circulating MST1, with a concentration greater than 1330.8 ng/L, was correlated with the 30-day mortality of ATAAD patients who underwent emergency surgery."

Although there are robust data for revascularization and valve procedures, the effect of race and socioeconomic status on proximal aortic surgery is not well studied. This study analyzed the impact of race and socioeconomic status on in-hospital outcomes after proximal aortic surgery. All adult patients who underwent proximal aortic surgery for aortic dissection or thoracic aneurysm from the 2016 to 2018 National Inpatient Sample were included. Primary outcomes included in-hospital mortality and in-hospital composite morbidity (stroke, pulmonary embolus, major bleeding, acute kidney injury, or permanent pacemaker insertion). Adjusted outcomes were assessed with multivariable analysis. A weighted total of 32,895 patients were included; 25,461 (77.4%) classified as White, 3224 (9.8%) Black, 2039 (6.2%) Hispanic, and 2171 (6.6%) other. Black and Hispanic patients had significantly lower median household income, higher proportion of self-pay insurance status, younger age, higher comorbidity burden, and a higher proportion of urgent or emergency procedures compared with White patients. There was no significant difference in observed in-hospital mortality by patient race, but non-White patients had significantly higher composite morbidity. On adjusted analysis, there was no difference in in-hospital mortality, but non-White race was an independent predictor of in-hospital morbidity (adjusted odds ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.4-1.8; P < .001). Patients of non-White race who undergo proximal aortic surgery have less insurance coverage, more urgent procedures, and a higher comorbidity burden than White patients, disparities that translate to significantly higher morbidity in non-White. A greater focus on nonfatal outcome differentials and improving access to care likely will improve aortic surgery disparities."

    "abstract": "Delayed sternal closure (DSC) is a useful option for patients with intractable bleeding and hemodynamic instability due to prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass and a preoperative bleeding tendency. Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) has been widely used for sternal wound problems, but only rarely for DSC, and its efficacy for mediastinal drainage immediately after cardiac surgery has not been well established. Therefore, we evaluated the usefulness of DSC using VAC in adult cardiac surgery. We analyzed 33 patients who underwent DSC using VAC from January 2017 to July 2022. After packing sterile gauze around the heart surface and great vessels, VAC was applied directly without sternal self-retaining retractors and mediastinal drain tubes. Twenty-one patients (63.6%) underwent emergency surgery for conditions including type A acute aortic dissection (n=13), and 8 patients (24.2%) received postoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Intractable bleeding (n=25) was the most common reason for an open sternum. The median duration of open sternum was 2 days (interquartile range [25th-75th pertentiles], 2-3.25 days) and 9 patients underwent VAC application more than once. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 27.3%. Superficial wound problems occurred in 10 patients (30.3%), and there were no deep sternal wound infections. For patients with an open sternum, VAC alone, which is effective for mediastinal drainage and cardiac decompression, had an acceptable superficial wound infection rate and no deep sternal wound infections. In adult cardiac surgery, DSC using VAC may be useful in patients with intractable bleeding or unstable hemodynamics with myocardial edema."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous isolated mesenteric arterial dissection (SIMAD) is an uncommon subset of non-traumatic dissection of the mesenteric arteries without concurrent aortic dissection. Due to the widespread use of computer tomography angiography, SIMAD cases have been increasingly reported in the past 20 years. Common risk factors associated with SIMAD include male gender, age 50-60 years, hypertension and smoking. This review summarises the diagnostic pathway and management of SIMAD based on contemporary literature and proposes a treatment algorithm for SIMAD. The presentation of SIMAD can be divided into symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. Symptomatic patients should be carefully assessed to detect the development of complications, particularly bowel ischemia or vessel rupture. Although these complications are rare, they necessitate urgent surgical management. The vast majority of symptomatic SIMAD cases are uncomplicated and can be managed safely with conservative treatment that includes antihypertensive therapy, bowel rest, with or without antithrombotic therapy. For asymptomatic SIMAD cases, expectant management with outpatient surveillance imaging appears to be a safe strategy."

We enrolled 72 octogenarians who had undergone type A aortic dissection surgery between April 2013 and March 2019. The psoas muscle index, an indexed area of the psoas muscle at the L3 level on preoperative computed tomography, was obtained as an indicator of sarcopenia. The study participants were divided into sarcopenia and non-sarcopenia groups based on the mean psoas muscle index. The postoperative outcomes were compared between the groups. The median age was 84 years (interquartile range 82-87 years), and 13 patients were male. The mean psoas muscle index was 3.53 ± 0.97 cm2/m2. Except for sex, no significant differences were observed in patients' baseline characteristics and operative data between the two groups. The 30-day mortality rates in the sarcopenia and non-sarcopenia groups were 14% and 8%, respectively (P = 0.71), and postoperative morbidity was similar in both groups. Postoperative all-cause mortality was significantly higher in the sarcopenia group (log-rank P = 0.038), especially in patients aged 85 years or older (log-rank P < 0.01). The sarcopenia group had a lower home discharge rate than the non-sarcopenia group (21% vs. 54%, P < 0.01), and home discharge was associated with longer survival (log-rank P = 0.015). All-cause mortality after emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection was significantly higher in octogenarians with sarcopenia than in those without, especially in patients aged 85 years or older."

We describe the case of a 62-year-old female with a clinical history of Marfan syndrome where the low sensitivity of the transthorac approach in the detection of descending aortic dissection was overcomed by the posterior thoracic approach with the posterior paraspinal window (PPW). In the literature, are described just few reports where echocardiography via the PPW makes it possible to diagnose acute descending aortic syndrome."

Guideline-recommended diagnostic workup is based on pre-test probability assessment (PPA) and d-dimer testing. However, the performance of PPA and d-dimer has never been studied in individuals with previous AAS (pAAS), which represent a challenging population. Materials and Methods. We analyzed a registry of patients with pAAS evaluated in two Emergency Departments (EDs) for suspected novel AAS (nAAS). Enrolment criteria were history of pAAS and the presence of truncal pain, syncope or perfusion deficit. All patients underwent advanced imaging. Clinical data were registered prospectively and PPA was performed by applying the aortic dissection detection (ADD) and an aorta simplified (AORTAs) score. Results. A total of 128 patients were enrolled, including 77 patients with previous Stanford type A aortic dissection and 45 patients with previous Stanford type B aortic dissection. The final diagnosis was nAAS in 40 (31%) patients. Clinical variables associated with nAAS were: aortic valve disease, thoracic aortic aneurysm, severe pain, sudden pain, ripping/tearing pain and hypotension/shock. ADD score ≥ 2 had a sensitivity of 65% and a specificity of 83% for nAAS; AORTAs score ≥ 2 had a sensitivity of 48% and a specificity of 88%. d-dimer (cutoff ≥ 500 ng/mL or age-adjusted cutoff) had a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 13%/14.7%, for diagnosis of nAAS. Patients that were candidates for guideline-compliant PPA/d-dimer integrated rule-out were: 5 (4.9%) with ADD ≤ 1/d-dimer and 8 (7.8%) with AORTAs ≤ 1/d-dimer < age-adjusted cutoff. None of them had a nAAS. Conclusions. Patients with pAAS evaluated in the ED for red-flag symptoms showed intermediate-to-high pre-test probability of nAAS. The ADD score had lower sensitivity and specificity than in unselected patients. d-dimer, alone and integrated with PPA, was highly sensitive for nAAS, but very unspecific. PPA/d-dimer integrated strategies are unlikely to significantly reduce the number of patients with pAAS undergoing advanced imaging."

In experienced centers it offers excellent short- and long-term results, making the procedure an attractive alternative for aortic root replacement especially in young patients. The aim of this study was to analyze long-term results of AVSRR using the David operation in our institution over the last 25 years. This is a single-center retrospective analysis of outcomes of David operations performed in a teaching institution not running a large AVSRR-program. Pre-, intra- and postoperative data were collected from the institutional electronic medical record system. Follow-up data were collected through direct contact of the patients and their cardiologists/primary care physicians. Between 02/1996 and 11/2019, 131 patients underwent David operation in our institution by a total of 17 different surgeons. Median age was 48 (33-59), 18% were female. Elective surgery was performed in 89% of the cases, 11% were operated as emergency in the setting of an acute aortic dissection. Connective tissue disease was present in 24% and 26% had a bicuspid aortic valve. At hospital admission 61% had aortic regurgitation grade ≥3, 12% were in functional NYHA-class ≥III. 30-day mortality was 2%, 97% of the patients were discharged with aortic regurgitation ≤2. In 10-year follow-up, 15 (12%) patients had to be re-operated because of root-related complications. Seven patients (47%) received a transcatheter aortic valve implantation, 8 (53%) required surgical replacement of the aortic valve or a Bentall-De Bono operation. Estimated reoperation-free survival at 5 and 10 years was 93.5% ± 2.4% and 87.0% ± 3.5%, respectively. Subgroup analysis showed no differences in reoperation-free survival for patients presenting with a bicuspid valve or preoperative aortic regurgitation ≥3. However a preoperative left ventricular end diastolic diameter of ≥5.5 cm was associated with worse outcome. David operations can be performed with excellent perioperative and 10-year follow-up outcomes in centers not running large AVSRR-programs."

The goal of this study was to evaluate clinical outcomes of initial medical treatment (IMT) and the effectiveness of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for AAAD with T-FL. We retrospectively analysed 60 patients with AAAD with T-FL. Emergency aortic repair was performed in 33 patients, and IMT was selected in 27 uncomplicated patients with ascending aortic diameter < 50 mm and ascending T-FL thickness ≤ 10 mm. Among the 27 patients who received IMT, 14 had intramural haematomas at admission; however, new ulcer-like projections appeared in 7 (50%) during hospitalization. Before discharge, 12 (44%) were given medical treatment only, and 15 (56%) required delayed aortic repair including TEVAR in 8 and open repair in 7. The median interval from onset to delayed repair was 9 days, and significantly more patients received TEVAR compared to those receiving emergency repair (53% vs 21%; P = 0.043). Between the TEVAR (n = 15) and the open repair (n = 33) groups, 1 (7%) 30-day death occurred in the TEVAR group, whereas no in-hospital deaths occurred in the open repair group. During the median follow-up time of 24.8 months, no aorta-related death was observed, and there were no statistically significant differences in the rate of freedom from aortic events (TEVAR: 92.8%/3 years vs open repair: 88.4%/3 years; P = 0.871). Our management, using a combination of emergency aortic repair, IMT and delayed aortic repair for AAAD with T-FL, achieved favourable clinical outcomes. Among the selected Japanese patients, IMT with repeated multidetector computed tomography could detect a new intimal tear that could be closed by TEVAR in some cases. Using EVAR for this pathology resulted in acceptable early and midterm outcomes. Further investigations are required to validate the safety and efficacy of this management procedure."

This retrospective analysis included 721 extent IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repairs performed in our institution from 1986 to 2021. Indications for repair were aneurysm without dissection in 627 cases (87.0%) and aortic dissection in 94 cases (13.0%). Overall, 466 patients (64.6%) were symptomatic preoperatively; 124 (17.2%) procedures were performed in patients with acute presentation, including 58 (8.0%) ruptured aneurysms. Operative death occurred after 49 (6.8%) repairs. Persistent renal failure necessitating dialysis occurred after 43 (6.0%) repairs. Binary logistic regression modeling revealed that previous extent II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair, chronic kidney disease, previous myocardial infarction, urgent or emergency repair, and longer crossclamp times during surgery were independently associated with operative mortality. Among early survivors (n = 672), competing risk analysis revealed that cumulative incidence of mortality and reintervention rates at 10 years were 74.8% (95% confidence interval, 71.4%-78.5%) and 3.3% (95% confidence interval, 2.2%-5.1%), respectively. Although patient comorbidities contributed to operative mortality, factors associated with the repair, such as urgent or emergency status, the duration of aortic crossclamping, and certain types of complex reoperation, also played prominent roles. Patients who survive the operation can expect a durable repair that usually is free from late reintervention. Expanding our collective knowledge regarding patients who undergo open repair of extent IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms will enable clinicians to establish best practices and improve patient outcomes."

The goal of the present study was to identify potential protein biomarkers associated with TAAs, using proteomic analysis of aortic tissue and plasma samples. Extracted proteins from 14 aneurysmal and 12 non-aneurysmal thoracic aortic tissue specimens as well as plasma samples from six TAA patients collected pre-and postoperatively and six healthy controls (HC), were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Proteomic data were further processed and following filtering criteria, one protein was selected for verification and validation in a larger cohort of patients and controls using a targeted quantitative proteomic approach and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. A total of 1593 and 363 differentially expressed proteins were identified in tissue and plasma samples, respectively. Pathway enrichment analysis on the differentially expressed proteins revealed a number of dysregulated molecular pathways that might be implicated in aneurysm pathology including complement and coagulation cascades, focal adhesion, and extracellular matrix receptor interaction pathways. Alpha-2-HS glycoprotein (AHSG) was selected for further verification in 36 TAA and 21 HC plasma samples using targeted quantitative proteomic approach. The results showed a significantly decreased concentration of AHSG (p = 0.0002) in the preoperative plasma samples compared with HC samples. Further analyses using a larger validation dataset revealed that AHSG protein levels were significantly lower (p = 0.03) compared with HC. Logistic regression analysis on the validation dataset revealed males, advanced age, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia as significant risk factors for TAA. AHSG concentrations distinguish plasma samples derived from TAA patients and controls. The findings of this study suggest that AHSG may be a potential biomarker for TAA that could lead to better diagnostic capabilities."

    "abstract": "Distal stent graft induced new entry (dSINE) is an emerging complication after frozen elephant trunk (FET) procedure. The aim of this computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study was to investigate the role of wall shear stress (WSS) after the development of dSINE based on hemodynamic changes. Aortic diameter and WSS of five patients who developed a dSINE after FET procedure were retrospectively analyzed before and after the occurrence of dSINE. Patient-specific 3-dimentional surface models of the aortic lumen were reconstructed from computed tomography angiographic datasets (pre dSINE: n=5, dSINE: n=5) to perform steady-state CFD simulations with laminar blood flow and zero pressure outlet conditions. WSS was calculated at the level of the stent graft (SG), the landing zone of the SG and at a location further distal to the SG, as well as on the outer and inner curvature of the aorta from SG center to its distal end. Post dSINE occurrence, median WSS increased significantly from 0.87 [interquartile range (IQR): 0.83-1.03] to 1.55 (IQR: 1.09-2.70) Pa, (P=0.043) within the SG and from 1.22 (IQR: 0.81-1.44) to 1.76 (IQR: 1.55-3.60) Pa, (P=0.043) at the landing zone of the SG. A non-significant increase from 1.22 (IQR: 0.59-3.50) to 2.58 (IQR: 1.16-3.78) Pa, (P=0.686) further downstream was observed. WSS at the outer curvature of the SG was significantly higher compared to WSS at the inner curvature for dSINE. Adverse hemodynamic conditions in the form of elevated WSS consist inside and at the distal end of the SG as well as at the outer curvature of the aorta, which may contribute to weakening of the aortic wall. These new findings emphasize the relevance and potential of WSS in dSINE for additional adverse events, such as aortic rupture. Further prospective studies are warranted to explore if the combination of clinical parameters with WSS might be useful to decide which patients require an urgent reintervention in terms of a SG extension."

    "abstract": "Acute Type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is an emergency cardiovascular condition. In this current study, we aimed to investigate the prognostic importance of preoperative neutrophil-lymphocyte platelet ratio (NLPR) value in predicting in-hospital mortality, after surgical treatment of ATAAD. Consecutive patients who underwent an emergency operation as a result of ATAAD between August 2012 and August 2021 in our hospital, were retrospectively included in this study. Patients who survived the operation and were released were recorded as Group 1 and those who died in the hospital, as Group 2. Mortality (in-hospital) occurred in 44 (22.5%) patients (Group 2). The median age of the 151 patients included in Group 1 and 44 patients in Group 2 were 55 (37 to 81) and 59 (33 to 72) years, respectively (p = 0.191). In multivariate analysis Model 1, malperfusion (OR: 3.764, 95% CI: 2.140-4.152, p < 0.001), total perfusion time (OR: 1.156, 95% CI: 1.040-1.469, p = 0.012), low platelet counts (OR: 0.894, 95% CI: 0.685-0.954, p = 0.035) and NLR (OR: 1.944, 95% CI: 1.230-2.390, p < 0.001) were determined as independent predictors for mortality. In Model 2, malperfusion (OR: 3.391, 95% CI: 2.426-3.965, p < 0.001) and NLPR (OR: 2.371, 95% CI: 1.892-3.519, p < 0.001) were determined as independent predictors for mortality. According to our study, the NLPR value obtained preoperatively can be used to predict the risk of in-hospital mortality, after ATAAD surgery."

    "title": "Quiet & deadly: Painless aortic dissection.",
    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition that classically presents as a sudden, sharp pain with a ripping sensation. This disease is caused by a weakened area within the aortic arterial wall, which can be classified using the Stanford classifications into type A or type B dissections, depending on the location of the tear. It is described that 17.6% of patients died before arriving at the hospital, and 45.2% of patients died within 30 days of diagnosis (Melvinsdottir et al., 2016). However, 10% of patients present without pain, leading to delayed diagnosis. In this case, a 53-year-old male with prior history of hypertension, sleep apnea, and diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain earlier that day. However, he was asymptomatic on presentation. He had no cardiac history. He was admitted, and a subsequent workup was performed to rule out myocardial infarction. The following morning a slight bump in troponin consistent with a Non-ST Elevated Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) was noted. An echocardiogram was ordered and showed aortic regurgitation. This was followed by computed tomography angiography (CTA), which revealed acute type A ascending aortic dissection. He was transferred to our facility and underwent an emergent Bentall procedure. Ultimately, the patient tolerated the surgery well and is recovering. This case is essential because it emphasizes the painless presentation of type A aortic dissection. Mis- or undiagnosed, this condition often leads to death."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the early outcomes of a novel off the shelf pre-loaded inner branched thoraco-abdominal endograft (E-nside) in the treatment of aortic pathologies. Data from a physician initiated national multicentre registry on patients treated with the E-nside endograft, were prospectively collected and analysed. Pre-operative clinical and anatomical characteristics, procedural data, and early outcomes (90 days) were recorded in a dedicated electronic data capture system. The primary endpoint was technical success. Secondary endpoints were early mortality (90 days), procedural metrics, target vessel patency, endoleak rate, and major adverse events (MAEs) at 90 days. In total, 116 patients from 31 Italian centres were included. Mean ± standard deviation (SD) patient age was 73 ± 8 years and 76 (65.5%) were male. Aortic pathologies included degenerative aneurysm in 98 (84.5%), post-dissection aneurysm in five (4.3%), pseudoaneurysm in six (5.2%), penetrating aortic ulcer or intramural haematoma in four (3.4%), and subacute dissection in three (2.6%). Mean ± SD aneurysm diameter was 66 ± 17 mm; aneurysm extent was Crawford I - III in 55 (50.4%), IV in 21 (19.2%), pararenal in 29 (26.7%), and juxtarenal in four (3.7%). The procedure setting was urgent in 25 (21.5%) patients. Median procedural time was 240 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] 195, 303), with a median contrast volume of 175 mL (IQR 120, 235). The endograft's technical success rate was 98.2% and the 90 day mortality rate was 5.2% (n = 6; 2.1% for elective repair and 16% for urgent repair). The 90-days cumulative MAE rate was 24.1% (n = 28). At 90 days, there were 10 (2.3%) target vessel related events (nine occlusions and one type IC endoleak) and one type 1A endoleak requiring re-intervention. In this real life, non-sponsored registry, the E-nside endograft was used for the treatment of a broad spectrum of aortic pathologies, including urgent cases and different anatomies. The results showed excellent technical implantation safety and efficacy, as well as early outcomes. Longer term follow up is needed to better define the clinical role of this novel endograft."

    "abstract": "The long-term prognosis of patients with acute type A aortic dissection (AAD) is poor, despite emergency surgical treatment. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate patient risk factors to improve the prognosis. The aim of this study was to analyze the ability of the uric acid-to-albumin ratio (UAR) to predict the long-term mortality of patients with type A AAD after surgery. A total of 289 patients with type A AAD who had received surgical treatment was enrolled in this study. Peripheral blood samples were collected before anesthesia induction. All patients were divided into the UAR < 9.875 group and the UAR ≥ 9.875 group, and mortality significantly differed between the two groups. The patients were further divided into survival and non-survival groups, according to whether death occurred after the procedure based on a one-year follow up. Factors, including age, hypertension, albumin, UAR, and D-dimer, differed significantly between the survival and non-survival groups. The independent risk factors for long-term death in patients with type A AAD were analyzed by univariable and multivariable COX regression analyses, and the predictive value of these indices for postoperative mortality was assessed based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Preoperative UAR (HR 1.904, 95% CI, 1.097 to 3.305; P < 0.05), D-dimer (HR, 1.991,95% CI, 1.116 to 3.554; P < 0.05 ), and age (HR 2.216, 95% CI, 1.287 to 3.815; P < 0.05) were identified as independent risk factors for one-year mortality in patients with Type A AAD. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of UAR was 0.618 [95% (0.544, 0.693)], and the sensitivity and specificity were 69.6% and 51.8%, respectively (P = 0.003). The AUC for albumin was 0.349 [95% (0.274, 0.425)], and the sensitivity and specificity were 26.1% and 51.8%, respectively (P = 0.000), The AUC for uric acid was 0.544 [95% (0.470, 0.619)], and the sensitivity and specificity were 78.3% and 34.5%, respectively (P = 0.265). The AUC for UAR + age + D-dimer was 0.751 [95% (0.681, 0.821)], and the sensitivity and specificity were 76.8% and 68.2%, respectively. UAR in patients with type A AAD may be used as a new independent risk factor for long-term mortality. Its predictive value is superior to that of albumin or uric acid alone. The combination of UAR, age, and D-dimer provide good prognostic value."

After evaluation and based on electrocardiographic and laboratory findings, the patient was diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction with st elevation. Additionally, aortic dissection and hypertensive emergency with end-organ damage to the heart were suspected due to intense precordial pain and blood pressure readings of 230/120 mmHg. As part of the therapeutic approach, 3 mg of intravenous morphine diluted in 10 ml of 0.9 % saline solution were administered. Following administration, the patient exhibited suspected hypersensitivity. Therefore, a suspected adverse event assessment was performed using the Naranjo algorithm, and it was established that the effects of morphine were plausible (category probable). Se presenta el caso de un paciente masculino de 46 años. Este ingresó al servicio de urgencias con un cuadro clínico de una hora de evolución caracterizado por dolor torácico opresivo de intensidad 10/10 según la escala análoga del dolor.

This 66-year-old male presented to a local emergency department with non-radiating epigastric and mid-sternal chest pain and was found to have a non-traumatic peri-aortic hematoma of unknown etiology that developed over a period of 12 hours. Imaging revealed a newly formed left atrial thrombus causing mass effect on the pulmonary veins and a newly formed left-sided pleural effusion. The patient was subsequently transferred to an outside facility for higher level of care where additional pathological etiologies of hematoma were further excluded. Before discharge, the hematoma spontaneously dissipated and the patient was discharged on oral anticoagulants for treatment of the atrial thrombus and advised to follow-up on an outpatient basis with hematology and cardiology specialists."

    "abstract": "An aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA) is the most common congenital variant of the aortic arch. Usually, this variation is largely asymptomatic, but sometimes it may be involved in aortic dissection (AD). Surgical management of this condition is challenging. The therapeutic options have been enriched in recent decades by establishing individualized endovascular or hybrid procedures. Whether these less invasive approaches bear advantages, and how they have changed the treatment of this rare pathology, is still unclear. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review. We performed a review of literature from the past 20 years (from January 2000 until February 2021) complying with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. All reported patients treated for Type B AD in the presence of an ARSA were identified and classified into three groups according to the received therapy (open, hybrid, and total endovascular). Patient characteristics, as well as in-hospital mortality, and major and minor complications were determined and statistically analyzed. We identified 32 relevant publications comprising 85 patients. Open arch repair has been offered to younger patients, but significantly less often in symptomatic patients needing urgent repair. Therefore, the maximum aortic diameter was also significantly larger in the open repair group compared with that in the hybrid or total endovascular repair group. Regarding the endpoints, we did not find significant differences. The literature review revealed that open surgical therapies are preferred in patients presenting with chronic dissections and larger aortic diameters, most likely because they are unsuitable for endovascular aortic repair. Hybrid and total endovascular approaches are more often applied in emergency situations, where aortic diameters remain smaller. All therapies demonstrated good, early, and midterm outcomes. But, these therapies carry potential risks in the long term. Therefore, long-term follow-up data are urgently needed to validate that these therapies are sustainable."

The goal of this study was to determine the outcomes of thoracic endovascular aortic repair for R-AAAD at our institution and to discuss optimal indications. The medical records of 359 patients admitted to our institution for R-AAAD between December 2016 and December 2022 were reviewed, and 83 patients were finally diagnosed with R-AAAD. We selected thoracic endovascular aortic repair as an alternative, considering the anatomy of aortic dissection and the risk to patients undergoing open surgery. Nineteen patients underwent thoracic endovascular aortic repair for R-AAAD. No in-hospital deaths or neurologic complications occurred. A type Ia endoleak was detected in 1 patient. All other primary entries were successfully closed. All dissection-related complications, such as cardiac tamponade, malperfusion distal to the primary entry and abdominal aortic rupture, were resolved. One patient required open conversion for intimal injury at the proximal edge of the stent graft; all other ascending false lumens were completely thrombosed and contracted at discharge. During the follow-up period, no aortic-related deaths or aortic events proximal to the stent graft occurred. The indications for thoracic endovascular aortic repair were expanded to low-risk and emergency cases at our institution. The early- and midterm outcomes of thoracic endovascular aortic repair for R-AAAD were acceptable. Further long-term follow-up is required."

    "abstract": "Perioperative blood transfusions and postoperative drainage volume not only are the commonly recognized risk factors for acute kidney injury (AKI) but also are indirect indicators of coagulopathy in patients with acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD). However, standard laboratory tests fail to accurately reflect and assess the overall coagulopathy profile in patients with ATAAD. Thus, this study aimed to explore the association between the hemostatic system and severe postoperative AKI (stage 3) in patients with ATAAD using thromboelastography (TEG). We selected 106 consecutive patients with ATAAD who underwent emergency aortic surgery at Beijing Anzhen Hospital. All participants were categorized into the stage 3 and non-stage 3 groups. The hemostatic system was evaluated using routine laboratory tests and TEG preoperatively. We undertook univariate and multivariate stepwise logistic regression analyses to determine the potential risk factors for severe postoperative AKI (stage 3), with a special investigation on the association between hemostatic system biomarkers and severe postoperative AKI (stage 3). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to assess the predictive ability of hemostatic system biomarkers for severe postoperative AKI (stage 3). A total of 25 (23.6%) patients developed severe postoperative AKI (stage 3), including 21 patients (19.8%) who required continuous renal replacement therapy (RRT). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the preoperative fibrinogen level (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.03 to 3.00; p = 0.04), platelet function (MA level) (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.39; p = 0.001), and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.02; p = 0.02) were independently associated with severe postoperative AKI (stage 3). The cutoff values of preoperative fibrinogen and platelet function (MA level) for predicting severe postoperative AKI (stage 3) were determined to be 2.56 g/L and 60.7 mm in the ROC curve [area under the curve (AUC): 0.824 and 0.829; p < 0.001]. The preoperative fibrinogen level and platelet function (measured by the MA level) were identified as potential predictive factors for developing severe postoperative AKI (stage 3) in patients with ATAAD. Thromboelastography could be considered a potentially valuable tool for real-time monitoring and rapid assessment of the hemostatic system to improve postoperative outcomes in patients."

The Viabahn Open Revascularization TEChnique has been used for supra-aortic reconstruction during total arch replacement. This Cleveland Clinic technique is called \"branched stented anastomosis frozen elephant trunk repair.\" Our total arch replacement with reconstructed extended branched stented anastomosis frozen elephant trunk repair requires no unnecessary cervical artery exposure. We compared the outcomes of extended branched stented anastomosis frozen elephant trunk repair and conventional total arch replacement in acute aortic dissection type A. We compared the clinical course of patients undergoing total arch replacement using sutureless direct branch vessel stent grafting with frozen elephant trunk (extended branched stented anastomosis frozen elephant trunk repair) for acute aortic dissection type A with patients undergoing conventional total arch replacement. For the procedure, the aortic arch was transected circumferentially distal to the brachiocephalic artery origin. Frozen elephant trunk was fenestrated by heating with a cautery, and the self-expandable stent graft was delivered into the branch vessels through the fenestration. Of 58 cases, 21 and 37 were classified in the extended branched stented anastomosis frozen elephant trunk repair and conventional total arch replacement groups, respectively. The times (minutes) of selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (75 ± 24, 118 ± 47), total operation (313 ± 83, 470 ± 151), and cardiopulmonary bypass (195 ± 46, 277 ± 96) were significantly better in the extended branched stented anastomosis frozen elephant trunk repair group (P < .001). Six surgical deaths occurred: 2 (9%) in the extended branched stented anastomosis frozen elephant trunk repair group and 4 (10%) in the conventional total arch replacement group. In all cases, only 1 patient (2%) in the conventional total arch replacement group had a branch artery-related complication during the postoperative follow-up period. In the extended branched stented anastomosis frozen elephant trunk repair group, blood product use significantly decreased (P < .05). Extended branched stented anastomosis frozen elephant trunk repair has shown comparable safety and efficacy to conventional total arch replacement and can be used for acute aortic dissection type A emergency repair. It optimizes true lumen perfusion and facilitates supra-aortic artery remodeling."

We evaluated patient care provided by 110 fifth-year medical students during an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), using two clinical cases with standardized patients (SPs): generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and ascending aortic dissection (AAD). Half of the students encountered male and half female SPs. Except for gender, the cases were identical. We compared diagnosis and treatment of male vs female SPs. Students diagnosed GAD more often in female SPs than in male SPs (diagnosis completed, partially completed, and not completed in 47%, 16% and 36% respectively vs. 22%, 20%, and 58% for male SPs, p = 0.02). The nature of symptoms was better described for male SPs. For AAD, the emergency was more frequently identified and the examination of femoral pulses better performed in female SPs. Medical students have a gender bias when evaluating patients with GAD and AAD. The observed gender bias in the evaluation of patients, likely leads to differences in treatment between male and female patients (i.e. under-recognition of anxiety in men). Medical schools should implement gender-sensitive medical education initiatives to improve inclusive patient care."

    "abstract": "Acute dissection involving the ascending aorta and extending beyond the innominate artery (DeBakey type I) may be associated with acute ischemic complications owing to branch artery malperfusion. The purpose of this study was to document the prevalence of noncardiac ischemic complications associated with type I aortic dissections that persisted after initial ascending aortic and hemiarch repair, necessitating vascular surgery intervention. Consecutive patients presenting with acute type I aortic dissections between 2007 and 2022 were studied. Patients who underwent initial ascending aortic and hemiarch repair were included in the analysis. Study end points included the need for additional interventions after ascending aortic repair and death. There were 120 patients (70% men; mean age, 58 ± 13 years) who underwent emergent repair for acute type I aortic dissections during the study period. Forty-one patients (34%) presented with acute ischemic complications. These included 22 (18%) with leg ischemia, 9 (8%) with acute strokes, 5 (4%) with mesenteric ischemia, and 5 (4%) with arm ischemia. After proximal aortic repair, 12 patients (10%) had persistent ischemia. Nine patients (8%) required additional interventions for persistent leg ischemia (n = 7), intestinal gangrene (n = 1), or cerebral edema (craniotomy, n = 1). Three other patients with acute stroke had permanent neurologic deficits. All other ischemic complications resolved after the proximal aortic repair despite mean operative times exceeding 6 hours. Comparing patients with persistent ischemia with those whose symptoms resolved after central aortic repair, there were no differences in demographics, distal extent of dissection, mean operative time for aortic repair, or need for venous-arterial extracorporeal bypass support. Overall, 6 of the 120 patients (5%) suffered perioperative deaths. Hospital deaths occurred in 3 of the 12 patients (25%) with persistent ischemia vs none of 29 patients who had resolution of the ischemia after aortic repair (P = .02). Over a mean follow-up of 51 ± 39 months, no patient required an additional intervention for persistent branch artery occlusion. One-third of patients with acute type I aortic dissections had associated noncardiac ischemia, prompting a vascular surgery consultation. Limb and mesenteric ischemia most often resolved after the proximal aortic repair and did not require further intervention. No vascular interventions were performed in patients with stroke. Although the presence of acute ischemia at presentation did not increase hospital or 5-year mortality rates, persistent ischemia after central aortic repair seems to be a marker for increased hospital mortality after type I dissections."

Currently, no relevant studies have analyzed the difference in clinical benefits of endovascular repair in patients with TBAD in acute and non-acute stages. To investigate the clinical characteristics and prognosis of endovascular repair in patients with TBAD at different surgical timing. The medical records of 110 patients with TBAD from June 2014 to June 2022 were retrospectively selected as the study subjects. The patients were divided into an acute group (onset time ≤14 days) and a non-acute group (onset time >14 days) according to the time to surgery, and the two groups were compared in terms of surgery and hospitalization, aortic remodeling, and follow-up results. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze the factors affecting the prognosis of TBAD treated with endoluminal repair. The proportion of pleural effusion, heart rate, the rate of complete thrombosis of the false lumen and the difference in the maximum diameter of the false lumen in the acute group were higher than those in the non-acute group (P=0.015, <0.001, 0.029, <0.001). The length of hospital stay and the maximum postoperative diameter of the false lumen was lower than in the non-acute group (P=0.001, 0.004). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the technical success rate, overlapping stent length, overlapping stent diameter, immediate postoperative contrast type I endoleak, incidence of renal failure, ischemic disease, endoleaks, aortic dilatation, retrograde type A aortic coarctation, and death (P=0.386, 0.551, 0.093, 0.176, 0.223, 0.739, 0.085, 0.098, 0.395, 0.386); coronary artery disease [odds ratio (OR) =6.630, P=0.012], pleural effusion (OR =5.026, P=0.009), non-acute surgery (OR =2.899, P=0.037), and involvement of the abdominal aorta (OR =11.362, P=0.001) were all independent risk factors affecting the prognosis of TBAD treated with endoluminal repair. Acute phase endoluminal repair of TBAD may contribute to aortic remodeling, and the prognosis of TBAD patients can be assessed clinically in combination with coronary artery disease, pleural effusion, and involvement of the abdominal aorta for early intervention to reduce the associated mortality."

    "abstract": "An acute type A aortic dissection (AAAD) is a critical emergency and remains one of the most challenging diseases in cardiothoracic surgery. The existence of a pericardial hematoma caused by an aortic rupture can dramatically reduce the chances of survival (Jerzewski and Kulik in J Card Surg 29(4):529-530, 2014; Mehta et al. in Circulation 105(2):200-206, 2002; Gilon et al. in Am J Cardiol 103(7):1029-1031, 2009; Isselbacher et al. in Circulation 90(5):2375-2378, 1994). We assessed the surgical outcome of a high-risk group of patients with AAAD and a pericardial hematoma. In this study we included 430 Patients (67% male; median age: 64 years) who received surgical treatment between January 2000 and January 2018 at our facility for acute aortic dissection DeBakey type I. We divided the cohort in two groups: Group A consisted of high-risk patients with a pericardial hematoma (n = 162) and Group B of patients without pericardial hematoma (n = 268). Patients with a preoperative pericardial hematoma had a significantly higher requirement for preoperative mechanical resuscitation (A: 21%; B: 1.5%; P: < 0.001) and were relevantly more frequently admitted to the operation theater with an intubated status (A: 19.8%; B: 8.6%; P: < 0.001). The incidence of visceral malperfusion differed significantly between both groups (A. 11.7%, B. 6:0%; P: 0.034). Limited aortic arch repair (proximal aortic arch replacement) was preferred in the high-risk group (A: 51.9%; B: 40.3%; P: 0.020). However, survival time was generally reduced in these patients (A: 7.5 y; B: 9.9 y). AAAD patients with preoperative pericardial hematoma present themselves in potentially lethal conditions, with a significantly higher rate of visceral malperfusion. Despite the existence of this risk factor, a limited arch repair was favored. We have proven that cardiac compression is associated with preoperative intubation and mechanical resuscitation. Patients with pericardial hematoma must be further evaluated for preoperative pericardial drainage. In the event of long transfer times to an aortic center a slow drainage should be discussed to prevent early mortality."

    "abstract": "This study explored if long-distance transfer was safe for patients suffering from acute aortic dissection type A (AADA) and also analyzed the effectiveness of helicopter transfer and cloud-type imaging transfer systems for such patients in northern Hokkaido, Japan. The study included 112 consecutive patients who underwent emergency surgical treatment for AADA from April 2014 to September 2020. The patients were divided into two groups according to the location of referral source hospitals: the Asahikawa city group (group A, n = 49) and the out-of-the-city group (group O, n = 63). Use of helicopter transfer (n = 13) and cloud-type telemedicine (n = 20) in group O were reviewed as subanalyses.Transfer distance differed between groups (4.2 ± 3.5 km in group A vs 107.3 ± 69.2 km in group O; p = 0.0001), but 30-day mortality (10.2% in group A vs 7.9% in group O; p = 0.676) and hospital mortality (12.2% in group A vs 9.5% in group O; p = 0.687) did not differ. Operative outcomes did not differ with or without helicopter and cloud-type telemedicine, but diagnosis-to-operation time was shorter with helicopter (240.0 ± 70.8 vs 320.0 ± 78.5 minutes; p = 0.031) and telemedicine (242.0 ± 75.2 vs 319.0 ± 83.8 minutes; p = 0.007). We found that long-distance transfer did not impair surgical outcomes in AADA patients, and both helicopter transfer and cloud-type telemedicine system could contribute to the reduction of diagnosis-to-operation time in the large Hokkaido area. Further studies are mandatory to investigate if both the systems will improve clinical outcomes."

    "abstract": "An anatomic association between ductus diverticulum and the primary entry tear in type B aortic dissection was observed. The aim was to reveal the association between ductus diverticulum and acute type B aortic dissection. A matched case-control study was conducted. Case subjects were extracted from consecutive patients with aortic dissection in the emergency department during 2019; the control subjects were extracted from consecutive patients without major aortic disease during 2019. 1:1 matching was performed for age, sex, and comorbidity, the prevalence of ductus diverticulum was compared, and conditional logistic regression was performed to reveal the association of ductus diverticulum and acute type B aortic dissection. In addition, the anatomic association between the ductus diverticulum and the primary entry tear was assessed in extracted cases, and baseline parameters were compared between dissection patients with or without ductus diverticulum. 128 cases and 402 control subjects were extracted. 86 pairs were formed after matching, and the proportion of ductus diverticulum (19.8% vs 1.2%, p < 0.001) was higher in the case group. Conditional logistic regression revealed ductus diverticulum(OR = 22.04, 95%CI: 2.81-172.76, p = 0.003) as an independent predictor for acute type B aortic dissection. Besides, the ductus diverticulum has an anatomic association with the primary entry tear (OR = 4.22, 95%CI: 1.46-12.25, p = 0.008), and dissection patients with ductus diverticulum were younger (47.9 vs 54.4, p = 0.015) than dissection patients without ductus diverticulum. Ductus diverticulum is common in acute type B aortic dissection and is independently associated with acute type B aortic dissection."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is the most common acute aortic syndrome. It is a life-threatening condition and surgical emergency associated with high mortality if not treated promptly. While it is well established that cardiovascular disease recognises different pathophysiological pathways between men and women, there is limited evidence of sex differences in AAS, especially in type A AAD. According to a recent synthesis of clinical studies on gender differences in type A AAD, women were found to have different baseline characteristics, presentation and outcomes, and thus sex should be considered relevant for diagnosis, risk-stratification and management of type A AAD."

    "abstract": "Interest in simulation has grown substantially, as has enthusiasm for team-based approaches to surgical training. In cardiothoracic surgery, the dynamic ability of the entire team is critical to emergent events. We developed innovative, interprofessional simulation events to improve team confidence. Two separate simulations event replicating critical steps and potential crises of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were attended by members of the multidisciplinary cardiothoracic team. Standard CPB equipment, echocardiography, an app to control vital signs, and typical operating room tools for cannulation were all used. Participant started at their typical roles, then rotated into unfamiliar roles for subsequent simulations. Survey and Likert scale self-assessment tools were used to determine outcomes. Statistical analysis compared results. Two separate events were attended by a total of 37 team members (17 facilitators and 20 participants). Participants rotated roles through 12 routine and high-risk scenarios for instituting and separating from CPB. Participant evaluation results were highly favorable, with requests for further similar events. Objectively, the mean score for self-assessment rose significantly comparing the pre- and post-simulation assessments. Despite a small sample size, these differences did reach statistical significance in two categories: iatrogenic dissection (p 0.008), and emergent return to CPB (p 0.016). In our experience, high-fidelity interprofessional simulation promoted team communication and confidence for key scenarios related to institution of and separation from CPB."

    "abstract": "The Bentall procedure is a surgical technique used in the management of aortic root abnormalities with ascending aorta and aortic valve issues. The present study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of 18 patients treated with the Bentall procedure in a single center. The present study was a single-center retrospective case series conducted over a period of 3 years. The patients had either acute ascending dissection and/or dilated ascending aorta with aortic valve dysfunction. The Bentall procedure was performed via standard median sternotomy. St. Jude Medical composite grafts with a valve were applied in all cases. A total number of 18 patients with either acute ascending dissection and/or dilated ascending aorta with aortic valve dysfunction were included in the study. The age of the participants ranged from 27-60 years. The ratio of males to females was 16:2 (males, 88.8%). The symptoms developed 3-4 days prior to hospital admission. Chest pain was the most common presenting symptom (n=10, 55.5%). Hypertension was the most common risk factor (n=12, 66.6%). In total, 14 cases underwent emergency surgery (77.7%). The emergency surgery was performed in 9 patients within 24 h of arrival owing to the association of aortic root dissection with tamponade. For the other cases, the surgery was performed within 2 and 7 days (n=5, 27.7% and n=4, 22.2%) respectively. Early post-operative complications occurred in 5 patients (27.7%). On the whole, as demonstrated herein, the modifications of the Bentall procedure have a notable impact on decreasing the overall mortality rates. Raising the awareness of clinicians and the general population as regards aortic dissection may aid in the early referral of patients to specialized centers and may thus decrease the overall mortality rate."

    "abstract": "Aortic endografting and antegrade in situ laser fenestration of visceral arteries (LFEVAR) may be considered as an alternative to open surgery for the emergency repair of complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) in fragile patients. The aim of this article was to evaluate the midterm results of LFEVAR performed with polyester endografts. From August 2015 to December 2020, all consecutive LFEVAR performed for non-deferrable treatment of complex AAA were analysed. Polyester endografts were deployed and subsequently fenestrated using an atherectomy laser probe; the fenestrations were enlarged using cutting and semicompliant balloons before implantation of balloon expandable bridging stents into the target vessels. Prospectively collected midterm survival, patency, and re-intervention rates were analysed. Forty four procedures were performed for 11 type 1a endoleaks, five thoraco-abdominal aneurysms, 20 pararenal aneurysms, four segmental renal artery (RA) preservations, three anastomotic aneurysms, and one aortic dissection. One hundred and eight laser fenestrations were performed (26 for the superior mesenteric artery [SMA], 13 for the coeliac trunk, 33 and 31 for the right and left RA, respectively). The median ischaemia duration was 7, 48, 48, and 45 minutes, respectively. The technical success rate was 97%, with no open surgical conversions. The 30 day mortality was 4.5% (n = 2). No spinal cord ischaemia events were observed nor early stent related complications. Kaplan-Meier overall survival at two years was 73%, the aortic related re-intervention free survival was 70%, and the stent related re-intervention free survival was 90.6%. Four target vessel thromboses were detected, of which three were rescued. Three type IIIc endoleaks, one RA false aneurysm, and one SMA stenosis, required re-intervention during a median follow up of 24.7 months. Antegrade LFEVAR is feasible, safe, and provides satisfactory early and midterm outcomes for non-deferrable treatment of aortic pathologies involving the visceral segment. Long term data are mandatory to confirm the usefulness of this promising off label technique."

The aims of this study were to report actual preoperative management, surgery type, and early outcomes of surgical treatment for ATAAD in China. This cohort study uses data from the China Registry of Type A Aortic Dissection, a national clinical registry to investigate management of patients with Stanford type A aortic dissection. The data, including surgical management and outcomes of patients with ATAAD, were analyzed from January 2018 to December 2021. A total of 1,058 patients with ATAAD were enrolled in this study between January 2018 and December 2021. The mean age of all patients was 51.6 ±11.7 years. The median interval from onset to hospital was 10.65 hours (IQR: 6-24 hours), and the median interval from entering the emergency room to starting operation was 13 hours (IQR: 4.08-28.7 hours). Total arch repair was performed in 938 patients (88.7%), and frozen elephant trunk repair was performed in 800 patients (75.6%). The incidence of early mortality was 7.6%. The population of patients with ATAAD in China experienced a longer interval from onset to arrival at the hospital, received more extensive aortic arch repair, and showed a relatively lower early mortality. These findings suggest that there may be a huge survivor bias in patients with ATAAD in China, more efforts should be made to promote prehospital emergency care and preoperative management of Chinese ATAAD patients.

    "abstract": "Aortic intramural hematoma (AIH) is a life-threatening emergency that involves aortic wall integrity and is characterized by either a direct rupture of the vasa vasorum or spontaneous bleeding of an arterial plaque located in the tunica media of the aortic wall. A notable difference between AIH and acute aortic dissection is the absence of an intimal flap, a finding discernable on computed tomography angiography (CTA). Follow-up imaging allows for the monitoring of disease progression or early findings of impending complications. While some patients may require surgical intervention, medical management with blood pressure control remains the mainstay in treatment. Our case describes a patient who was found to be in cardiac arrest secondary to ventricular fibrillation and was then found to have presumed Stanford Type A aortic dissection on CTA. After reviewing the scans, the diagnosis was reclassified to AIH due to the absence of an intimal flap, the patient was then managed medically for AIH with antihypertensive medications."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a life-threatening cardiovascular emergency. Both neutrophil granzyme and interleukin (IL)-33/ST2 systems have proven to be effective diagnostic markers for AAD. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between plasma IL-33, soluble suppression of tumorigenesis-2 (sST2), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 levels at admission and all-cause mortality in patients with AAD. A total of 155 patients with AAD were enrolled from the Prospective Evaluation of Acute Chest Pain (PEACP) study. Plasma concentrations of IL-33, sST2, and MMP-9 were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and MPO was detected using a chemiluminescence immunoassay. Aortic anatomical parameters were measured using CT radiography. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality rate. The median age of the patients was 55 years, and 96 (61.9%) were diagnosed with type A-AAD. After adjusting for confounding factors, the highest tertiles of IL-33, sST2, MPO, and MMP-9 had hazard risks of 0.870 (95% CI: 0.412-1.836, P = 0.714), 3.769 (95% CI: 1.504-9.446, P = 0.005), 4.689 (95% CI: 1.985-11.076, P < 0.001), and 4.748 (95% CI: 1.763-12.784, P = 0.002), respectively, compared to the lowest tertile. Pearson's correlation analysis revealed a significant correlation between these markers (P < 0.001). Moreover, sST2, MPO, and MMP-9 levels had a significant positive correlation with aortic diameter and pseudolumen area (P < 0.001). The biomarkers sST2, MPO, and MMP-9 were independently associated with mortality in patients with AAD. The significant correlation between these biomarkers suggests a pathogenic role for the IL-33/ST2/neutrophil granzyme system in patients with AAD."

We compared the number of admissions and in-hospital mortality for emergency CVD during the pandemic (from January to December 2020) with those of pre-pandemic periods (from January 2018 to December 2019), using quarterly data from the Tokyo Cardiovascular Care Unit Network. The incidence rate in 2020 is compared with the average incidence rate observed in the same quarter of 2018 and 2019 and is presented as an incidence rate ratio (IRR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI). The number of admissions for acute myocardial infarction during the pandemic was significantly lower than before the pandemic, with an IRR of 0.93 (95 % CI; 0.88-0.98). Similarly, the IRR for unstable angina was 0.78 (95 % CI; 0.72-0.83), for acute heart failure was 0.84 (95 % CI; 0.76-0.91), for acute aortic dissection was 0.88 (95 % CI; 0.78-0.98), and for ruptured aortic aneurysm was 0.75 (95 % CI; 0.62-0.88). In quarterly comparisons, the numbers of acute aortic diseases and emergency arrhythmia significantly decreased from July to September 2020, while those of other emergency CVDs significantly declined in the 2020 April-June period, which includes the first wave period in Japan. In-hospital mortality of emergency CVDs was unchanged from the pre-pandemic period, except for acute aortic dissection, which increased in odds ratio of 1.31 (95 % CI 1.10-1.57). The COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced the number of admissions for all emergency CVDs in all or part of the year.

    "abstract": "Background Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute chest pain (ACP) syndrome undergo additional testing to exclude acute coronary syndrome (ACS), pulmonary embolism (PE), or aortic dissection (AD), often yielding negative results. Purpose To assess whether deep learning (DL) analysis of the initial chest radiograph may help triage patients with ACP syndrome more efficiently. Materials and Methods This retrospective study used electronic health records of patients with ACP syndrome at presentation who underwent a combination of chest radiography and additional cardiovascular or pulmonary imaging or stress tests at two hospitals (Massachusetts General Hospital [MGH], Brigham and Women's Hospital [BWH]) between January 2005 and December 2015. A DL model was trained on 23 005 patients from MGH to predict a 30-day composite end point of ACS, PE, AD, and all-cause mortality based on chest radiographs. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to compare performance between models (model 1: age + sex; model 2: model 1 + conventional troponin or d-dimer positivity; model 3: model 2 + DL predictions) in internal and external test sets from MGH and BWH, respectively. Results At MGH, 5750 patients (mean age, 59 years ± 17 [SD]; 3329 men, 2421 women) were evaluated. Model 3, which included DL predictions, significantly improved discrimination of those with the composite outcome compared with models 2 and 1 (AUC, 0.85 [95% CI: 0.84, 0.86] vs 0.76 [95% CI: 0.74, 0.77] vs 0.62 [95% CI: 0.60 0.64], respectively; P < .001 for all). When using a sensitivity threshold of 99%, 14% (813 of 5750) of patients could be deferred from cardiovascular or pulmonary testing for differential diagnosis of ACP syndrome using model 3 compared with 2% (98 of 5750) of patients using model 2 (P < .001). Model 3 maintained its diagnostic performance in different age, sex, race, and ethnicity groups. In external validation at BWH (22 764 patients; mean age, 57 years ± 17; 11 470 women), trends were similar and improved after fine tuning. Conclusion Deep learning analysis of chest radiographs may facilitate more efficient triage of patients with acute chest pain syndrome in the emergency department. © RSNA, 2023 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the demographic and anatomic characteristics, as well as perioperative and follow-up results of fenestration and parallel techniques for the endovascular repair of complex aortic diseases. A retrospective study was conducted on 67 consecutive patients underwent endovascular treatment for complex aortic diseases including abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), thoracoabdominal aneurysm (TAAA), aortic dissection, or prior endovascular repair with either fenestrated and parallel endovascular aortic repair (f-EVAR or ch-EVAR) at a single institute from 2013 to 2021. Choices of intervention were made by the disease' emergency, patients' general condition, the anatomic characteristics, as well as following the recommendation from the devices' guidelines. Patients' clinical demographics, aortic disease characteristics, perioperative details, and disease courses were discussed. Short- and mid-term follow-up results were obtained and analyzed. Endpoints were aneurysm-related and unrelated mortality, branch instability, and renal function deterioration. Totally, 34 and 27 patients received f-EVAR and ch-EVAR, while 6 patients received a combination of both. Fenestrated endovascular aortic repair was conducted mainly in AAA affecting visceral branches and TAAA, whereas ch-EVAR was normally utilized for infrarenal AAA. Regarding the average number of reconstructed arteries per patient, there was a significant difference among f-EVAR, ch-EVAR, and the combination group (mean = 2.3 ± 0.9, 1.4 ± 0.6, 3.5 ± 0.5, p<0.001). Primary technical success was achieved in 28 (82.4%), 22 (81.5%), and 3 (50.0%) patients for each group. Besides operational time (5.77 ± 2.58, 4.47 ± 1.44, p=0.033), no significant difference was observed for blood transfusion, intensive care unit (ICU) or hospital stay, blood creatinine level, 30-day complications, or follow-up complications between patients undergoing f-EVAR or ch-EVAR. Patients receiving combination of both techniques had a higher rate of blood transfusion (p=0.044), longer operational time (p=0.008) or hospital stay (p=0.017), as well as more stent occlusion (p=0.001), endoleak (p=0.004) at short-term and a higher rate of endoleak (p=0.023) at mid-term follow-up. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that f-EVAR and ch-EVAR techniques had acceptable perioperative and follow-up results and should be considered viable alternatives when encountering complex aortic diseases. This study sought to investigate the baseline and pathological characteristics, as well as perioperative and follow-up results of f-EVAR and ch-EVAR at a single Chinese institution. F-EVAR (mostly physician-modified f-EVAR) was applied in patients with a wide range of etiologies and disease types, while ch-EVAR was preferred for AAA in older patients with an average higher ASA grade. Our experience suggested acceptable safety and efficacy both for techniques, and no significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding any short or mid-term adverse events."

    "abstract": "In situ laser fenestrated endovascular aortic repair (L-FEVAR) is a novel and creative solution for complex aortic pathologies in the urgent and emergency setting. Outcomes of this technique, however, are poorly reported. We sought to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and outcomes of L-FEVAR in aortic arch pathologies. A systematic literature review and analysis were conducted in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses and Cochrane guidelines. A search was conducted using Google, PubMed, and Scopus to identify studies evaluating L-FEVAR. Two independent reviewers determined study inclusion. Case reports and series including < 10 patients were excluded. Reviewers also assessed the methodological quality and extracted data regarding outcomes. A meta-analysis of endoleak event rates was conducted using a fixed-effect model due to small sample size. Eight studies met inclusion criteria between 2013 and 2021. Most studies were retrospective (87.5%) with median follow-up duration of 12.5 months (range 10-42). There were 440 patients included (range 15-148), mostly men (64%). Mean age was 61 years (range 53-68). Included patients were all symptomatic with L-FEVAR being technically successful in 93.3% of cases. The main indication for aortic arch intervention was aortic dissection. Single fenestrations occurred most frequently (68%), followed by triple (22%) then double fenestrations (9%). Meta-analysis of 8 studies (n = 440) demonstrated an endoleak event rate of 0.06 (95% confidence interval 0.04-0.09, P < 0.001) with no observed statistically significant heterogeneity of effects (Q = 7.91, P = 0.34). The median operative time was 162 min (range 53-252) with median length of stay of 10 days (range 7-17). Primary branch patency was 96.6%. Secondary patency rate was 97%. Pooled complication rates such as endoleak occurred in 4.8%, stroke in 2.0%, spinal cord ischemia in 0.2%, retrograde dissection in 0.9%, and 30-day death in 2.0%. Access complications occurred in 0.4%. Antiplatelet regimen was poorly reported in the study cohort. In situ laser fenestration is a feasible, safe, and effective approach to treat aortic arch disease in patients who are unsuitable for open or custom-made endovascular means. High technical success and excellent short-term branch patency can be achieved. These single-institution series exhibit promising short-term outcomes. In a similar paradigm to investigational device exemptions studies for custom-made and physician modified endografts, these preliminary data make a persuasive argument for larger long-term multi-institutional prospective study of this promising technique."

    "title": "Acute aortic dissection.",
    "abstract": "Although substantial progress has been made in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of acute aortic dissection, it remains a complex cardiovascular event, with a high immediate mortality and substantial morbidity in individuals surviving the acute period. The past decade has allowed a leap forward in understanding the pathophysiology of this disease; the existing classifications have been challenged, and the scientific community moves towards a nomenclature that is likely to unify the current definitions according to morphology and function. The most important pathophysiological pathway, namely the location and extension of the initial intimal tear, which causes a disruption of the media layer of the aortic wall, together with the size of the affected aortic segments, determines whether the patient should undergo emergency surgery, an endovascular intervention, or receive optimal medical treatment. The scientific evidence for the management and follow-up of acute aortic dissection continues to evolve. This Seminar provides a clinically relevant overview of potential prevention, diagnosis, and management of acute aortic dissection, which is the most severe acute aortic syndrome."

    "title": "Epidemiology, mortality and miss rate of acute aortic syndrome in Ontario, Canada: a population-based study.",
    "abstract": "Acute aortic syndrome (AAS) is a life-threatening emergency. It describes three distinct diagnoses: acute aortic dissection, acute intramural hematoma and penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer. There are currently no accurate estimates for incidence, mortality or misdiagnosis. Our objectives were to determine the incidence, mortality and miss rate of acute aortic syndrome in the emergency department (ED). A population-based retrospective cohort study of anonymously linked data for residents of Ontario, Canada, was carried out. Incident cases of acute aortic syndrome were identified between 2003 and 2018 using a validated algorithm based on ICD-10 codes and death. Incidence (number of cases/population of Ontario), mortality, and miss rate were calculated. Miss rate was defined as when a patient was seen in the ED within 14 days prior to an acute aortic syndrome diagnosis with a presenting complaint consistent with acute aortic syndrome. There were 1299 cases of acute aortic syndrome over the study period [age mean (SD) 68.03 ± 14.70; female (n = 500, 38.5%); rural areas (n = 111, 8.6%)]. The overall annual incidence for acute aortic syndrome was 0.61 per 100,000. One year mortality decreased from 47.4 to 29.1%. ED mortality was 14.9%. In the 14 days prior to diagnosis 12.5% of patients were seen in the ED with a presentation consistent with acute aortic syndrome. Annual incidence of acute aortic syndrome was found to be lower than other population-based studies. Also, the burden of mortality is seen in the ED. Education initiatives should focus on the identification of acute aortic syndrome in the ED to address mortality and miss rate. RéSUMé: INTRODUCTION: Le syndrome aortique aigu (SAA) est une urgence qui met la vie en danger. Il décrit trois diagnostics distincts: dissection aortique aiguë, hématome intramural aigu et ulcère athéroscléreux pénétrant. Il n'existe actuellement aucune estimation précise de l'incidence, de la mortalité ou des diagnostics erronés. Nos objectifs étaient de déterminer l'incidence, la mortalité et le taux d'échec du syndrome aortique aigu dans le service des urgences (SU). MéTHODES: Une étude de cohorte rétrospective basée sur la population a été réalisée à partir de données liées anonymement pour les résidents de l'Ontario, Canada. Les cas incidents de syndrome aortique aigu ont été identifiés entre 2003-2018 à l'aide d'un algorithme validé basé sur les codes CIM-10 et les décès. L'incidence (nombre de cas/population de l'Ontario), la mortalité et le taux d'absence ont été calculés. Le taux d’omission a été défini comme le cas où un patient a été vu à l’urgence dans les 14 jours précédant un diagnostic de syndrome aortique aigu et que la plainte était conforme au syndrome aortique aigu. RéSULTATS: Il y a eu 1 299 cas de syndrome aortique aigu pendant la période d'étude (âge moyen (ET) 68,03 ±14,70 ; femmes (n = 500, 38,5 %) ; zones rurales (n = 111, 8,6%)). L'incidence annuelle globale du syndrome aortique aigu était de 0,61 pour 100 000. La mortalité à un an a diminué de 47,4 % à 29,1 %. La mortalité aux urgences était de 14,9 %. Au cours des 14 jours précédant le diagnostic, 12,5 % des patients ont été vus aux urgences avec une présentation compatible avec le syndrome aortique aigu. CONCLUSIONS: L'incidence annuelle de syndrome aortique aigu s'est avérée inférieure à celle d'autres études basées sur la population. En outre, le poids de la mortalité est observé aux urgences. Les initiatives de formation devraient se concentrer sur l'identification des syndrome aortique aigu aux urgences afin de réduire la mortalité et le taux d'échec."

    "abstract": "Logistic regression (LR) and artificial intelligence algorithms were used to analyze the risk factors for the early rupture of acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD). Data from electronic medical records of 200 patients diagnosed with ATAAD from the Department of Emergency of Guangdong Provincial People’s Hospital from April 2012 to March 2017 were collected. Logistic regression and artificial intelligence algorithms were used to establish prediction models, and the prediction effects of four models were analyzed. According to the LR models, we elucidated independent risk factors for ATAAD rupture, which included age > 63 years (odds ratio (OR) = 1.69), female sex (OR = 1.77), ventilator assisted ventilation (OR = 3.05), AST > 80 U/L (OR = 1.59), no distortion of the inner membrane (OR = 1.57), the diameter of the aortic sinus > 41 mm (OR = 0.92), maximum aortic diameter > 48 mm (OR = 1.32), the ratio of false lumen area to true lumen area > 2.12 (OR = 1.94), lactates > 1.9 mmol/L (OR = 2.28), and white blood cell > 14.2 × 109 /L (OR = 1.23). The highest sensitivity and accuracy were found with the convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Its sensitivity was 0.93, specificity was 0.90, and accuracy was 0.90. In this present study, we found that age, sex, select biomarkers, and select morphological parameters of the aorta are independent predictors for the rupture of ATAAD. In terms of predicting the risk of ATAAD, the performance of random forests and CNN is significantly better than LR, but the performance of the support vector machine (SVM) is worse than LR."

    "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery is associated with serious complication and high risk of mortality. The relationship between hemostatic system and the prognosis of patients with acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) has not been evaluated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between preoperative serum fibrinogen level and risk of postoperative AKI in patients with ATAAD. A total of 172 consecutive patients undergoing urgent aortic arch surgery for ATAAD between April 2020 and December 2021 were identified from Beijing Anzhen Hospital aortic surgery database. The primary outcome was postoperative AKI as defined by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. The univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were done to assess the independent predictors of risk for postoperative AKI. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated to evaluate the predictive probabilities of risk factors for AKI. In our study, 51.2% (88/172) patients developed postoperative AKI. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified low preoperative serum fibrinogen level (OR, 1.492; 95% CI, 1.023 to 2.476; p = 0.021) and increased body mass index (BMI) (OR, 1.153; 95% CI, 1.003 to 1.327; p = 0.046) as independent predictors of postoperative AKI in patients with ATAAD. A mixed effect analysis of variance modeling revealed that obese patients with low preoperative serum fibrinogen level had higher incidence of postoperative AKI (p = 0.04). The ROC curve indicated that low preoperative serum fibrinogen level was a significant predictor of AKI [area under the curve (AUC), 0.771; p < 0.001]. Low preoperative serum fibrinogen level and obesity were associated with the risk of postoperative AKI in patients with ATAAD. These data suggested that low preoperative serum fibrinogen level was preferred marker for predicting the postoperative AKI, especially in obese patients with ATAAD."

    "abstract": "The timing of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) after the onset of uncomplicated acute type B aortic dissection (uTBAD) remains controversial. The objective of this study was to evaluate the Society for Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) postapproval study (VQI PAS) data for the impact of TEVAR timing for uTBAD on early and late outcomes, including mortality, procedural complications, and long-term reintervention. The VQI PAS used for this analysis includes a total of 606 patients. Patients with uTBAD (defined as those without rupture or malperfusion) exclusive of cases categorized as emergent (N = 206) were divided into groups defined by the Society for Vascular Surgery/Society of Thoracic Surgeons reporting guidelines based on the timing of treatment after the onset of dissection: within 24 hours (N = 8), 1 to 14 days (N = 121), and 15 to 90 days (N = 77). Univariate and multivariable analysis were used to determine differences between timing groups for postoperative mortality, in-hospital complications, and reintervention. Demographics and comorbid conditions were very similar across the 3 TEVAR timing groups. Notable differences included a higher prevalence of baseline elevated creatinine (>1.8 mg/dL)/chronic end-stage renal disease and designation as \"urgent\" in the <24-hour group, as well as a higher rate of preoperative β-blocker therapy in the 1- to 14-day group. Postoperative stroke, congestive heart failure, and renal ischemia were more common in the <24-hour group without an increase in mortality. Unadjusted 30-day mortality across groups was lowest in the early TEVAR group (0%, 3.3%, and 5.2%; P = .68), as was 1-year mortality (0%, 8.3%, and 18.2%; P = .06), although not statistically different at any time point. Reintervention out to 3 years was not different between the groups. Multivariable analysis demonstrated the need for a postoperative therapeutic lumbar drain to be the only a predictive risk factor for mortality (hazard ratio = 7.595, 95% confidence interval: 1.730-33.337, P = .007). When further subdivided into patients treated 1 to 7 days or 8 to 14 days after dissection, findings were similar. Patients with uTBAD treated within 24 hours were unusual (N = 8), too small for valid statistical comparison, and likely represent a high-risk subgroup, which is manifested in a higher risk of complications. Although there was a trend toward improved survival in the acute (1- to 14-day) phase, outcomes did not differ compared with the subacute (15- to 90-day) phase with relation to early mortality, postoperative complications, or 1-year survival. These data suggest that the proper selection of patients for early TEVAR can result in equivalent survival and early outcomes."

    "abstract": "Aortic coarctation (CoAo) may be discovered only when complicated by acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD). We present a case with a one-stage repair of this pathologic association and review the relevant literature focusing on the surgical choices. A 43-year-old man presented with acute thoracic pain. Computed tomography and echocardiography demonstrated CoAo, ATAAD type II, an ascending aorta aneurysm, and moderate regurgitation of a bicuspid aortic valve. Emergency surgery was performed. A clamshell incision, cardiopulmonary bypass with dual arterial cannulation (axillo-femoral), CoAo repair (by resection-interposition), and supracoronary aorta replacement were performed. Four years later, the patient was healthy and asymptomatic. Thirty surgical cases of ATAAD with CoAo repair after the dissection onset were included. Iatrogenic dissections and formerly repaired CoAo without surgical indication were excluded. The mean patient age was 27.8 ± 12 years; there was a male predominance (76.7%). The patients frequently presented with ascending aorta aneurysm (86.2%), bicuspid aortic valve (69%), and type II dissection (79.3%); dissection never extended below the CoAo. The one-stage treatment (15 patients; 55.5%) included 12 surgical repairs of CoAo (mostly by ascending-to-descending aorta extra-anatomic bypass; 58.3%) and three balloon angioplasties. In patients with uncorrected CoAo at the onset of cardiopulmonary bypass, double arterial perfusion was used in 55.5%. One-stage repair (hybrid or surgical), double arterial perfusion, and extra-anatomic ascending-to-descending aorta bypass are the most common options for treating ATAAD-CoAo. The clamshell incision provides excellent access for an extended arch procedure and facilitates anatomic isthmus repair."

    "abstract": "To determine whether CT aortography was performed in proportion to patient risk for acute aortic syndrome (AAS) and incidence of AAS for different ethnic groups. All atraumatic thoracic aorta CT aortographic examinations performed in adults (age > 15 years) suspected of having AAS between January 2009 and December 2019 at Auckland City Hospital (New Zealand) were included. Patients were risk stratified using the aortic dissection detection risk score (ADD-RS). The primary outcomes were the ratio of CT aortography rates to rates of positive CT aortographic examinations and the incidence of AAS. Population census data were used to determine age-standardized incidence of AAS in the emergency department (ED). In total, 1646 CT aortographic examinations were performed in 1543 patients (mean age, 62 years ± 16 [SD]; 877 male patients). Māori (34% [68 of 203]) and Pacific Islanders (35% [80 of 229]) were more likely to be at high risk of AAS (ADD-RS > 1) compared with patients from other ethnic groups (25% [308 of 1214]); in the ED catchment population, age-standardized AAS incidence was significantly higher in Māori (6.9 per 100 000 person-years [95% CI: 4.3, 10.4]) and Pacific Islanders (5.3 [95% CI: 3.4, 7.8]) than in other ethnic groups (2.3 [95% CI: 1.8, 2.8]). Despite this higher incidence, disproportionately fewer CT aortographic examinations were requested in the ED for Māori (9.2 CT aortographic examinations per AAS diagnosis) and Pacific Islanders (9.2 CT aortographic examinations per AAS diagnosis) compared with other ethnic groups (13.8 CT aortographic examinations per AAS diagnosis). Māori and Pacific Islanders were at disproportionately higher risk of AAS but had fewer requested CT aortographic examinations compared with other ethnic groups. This increased risk of AAS in Pacific Islander and indigenous Māori patients should be considered by clinicians when investigating AAS.Keywords: Ethnicity, Māori, Pacific Islander, Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score, Acute Aortic Syndrome, Aortic Dissection, CT Angiography Supplemental material is available for this article. © RSNA, 2022."

Our aim was to evaluate the correlation of inter arm systolic blood pressure difference (IASBPD), inter leg systolic blood pressure difference (ILSBPD), and ABI with acute aortic dissection (AAD) and their role in predicting AAD. In this prospective case-control study, 180 patients with AAD admitted to the emergency department were prospectively and consecutively collected in Tongji Hospital from October 2019 to December 2020. 180 healthy people matched by sex, age and BMI served as control group. All participants were adults over 18 years of age who underwent four-limb blood pressure measurements. IASBPD, ILSBPD and ABI were compared between the two groups and their associations with AAD were analyzed. A total of 360 patients (180 cases and 180 controls) were analyzed. In case group IASBPD was larger [(15.23 ± 16.15) mm Hg vs. (4.19 ± 3.63) mm Hg] and ILSBPD was larger (13.00 mm Hg vs. 5.70 mm Hg). ABI was smaller [(0.98 ± 0.24) vs. (1.12 ± 0.09)], and the difference was statistically significant (all p < 0.05). According to the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), IASBPD ≥ 10 mm Hg (Sen 61.7%, Spe 88.9%), ILSBPD ≥ 13 mm Hg (Sen 50.6%, Spe 80.6%) and ABI ≤ 0.9 (Sen 53.3%, Spe 87.2%), showed significant correlation with AAD (all p < 0.001). Compared with healthy people, IASBPD and ILSBPD levels were higher and ABI levels were lower in patients with AAD. IASBPD ≥ 10 mm Hg and ILSBPD ≥ 13 mm Hg can be used as indicators for early screening of AAD, and IASBPD ≥ 10 mm Hg has better predictive value for the occurrence of AAD. In patients with typical chest pain, attention needs to be paid to measuring blood pressure in the extremities."

Between 2003 and 2020, 208 consecutive patients with acute type A aortic dissection underwent emergency surgical repair. Cardiopulmonary bypass was attempted to establish direct bilateral axillary arterial cannulation and bicaval drainage. Antegrade selective cerebral perfusion was established by axillary perfusion and direct cannulation of the left common carotid artery. Ascending aortic, partial arch, and extended total aortic arch replacement were performed in 50 (24.0%), 7 (3.4%), and 151 (72.6%) patients, respectively. Aortic root surgery and coronary artery bypass grafting were performed concomitantly in 23 and seven patients, respectively. Cardiopulmonary bypass was attempted only through bilateral axillary cannulation in all patients but was successful in 13 (6.3%) patients without bilateral axillary cannulation. No postoperative complications occurred related to this technique. There were seven hospital deaths (early mortality rate, 3.4%). Five patients had postoperative reoperation for bleeding, and nine (4.3%) were transferred to other hospitals due to postoperative permanent cerebral infarction, particularly two with arm ischemia. The 10-year survival rate of patients who underwent emergency surgical repair with this technique was 71.4%. Direct bilateral axillary arterial cannulation followed by selective cerebral perfusion was successful in 93.7% of patients and this may be an optimal solution for providing stable outcomes after emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection. However, we experienced two complications of arm ischemia, attention should be paid to potential arm ischemia."

Standard adult resuscitation guidelines need to be followed with some modifications, taking into account the maternal-fetal physiology, which clinicians should be familiar with. During cardiac arrest, the emphasis is on advanced airway management, manual uterine displacement to relieve aortocaval compression and performing a resuscitative hysterotomy (peri-mortem caesarean delivery) swiftly in patients who are more than 20 weeks gestation to improve maternal survival. Annual multidisciplinary simulation training is recommended for all professionals involved in maternity care; this can improve teamwork, communication and emergency preparedness during maternal collapse."

    "abstract": "Stanford type A aortic dissection (TAAD) is the most common and fatal type of dissection. An easier-to-use risk stratification may help eliminate bias in patients at high risk of dissection. The age, serum creatinine, and ejection fraction (ACEF) score is a simple risk model developed to predict the mortality risk of elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between preoperative ACEF score and operative mortality in patients with TAAD undergoing emergency surgery. In this retrospective cohort study, 113 patients diagnosed with TAAD between January 2017 and September 2021 were evaluated. The primary endpoint was operative mortality. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed for the ACEF score, ACEF II score, and European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II. Univariate and multivariate analyses of operative mortality were performed using the logistic regression model. Operative mortality occurred in 23 (20.4%) patients. The cutoff ACEF score was calculated as 1.1 for predicting operative mortality (area under the curve = 0.712, P value = 0.002, sensitivity = 74.0%, specificity = 67.8%, likelihood ratio = 2.3). Based on the cutoff value, 46 (40.7%) patients had a high ACEF score (ACEF ≥ 1.1) and 67 (59.3%) patients had a low ACEF score (ACEF < 1.1). The high ACEF score was associated with an increased incidence of operative mortality compared with the low ACEF score (37.0% vs. 9.0%; P = 0.001). The ACEF score can be used as a useful and relatively simple tool for risk stratification before TAAD surgery. However, the ACEF score is only indicated for risk assessment and should not affect treatment."

PFFLs were measured in patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm (n = 27) or dissection (n = 28). For comparison, patients without aortic pathology who had presented to the emergency department with acute chest pain (n = 281) were categorized into three groups according to the cause of the chest pain: ischemic cardiac chest pain; nonischemic cardiac chest pain; and noncardiac chest pain. The PFFLs were measured using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fibrillin-1 fragments were detectable in all patients and were lowest in the ischemic cardiac chest pain group. Age, sex, and the presence of hypertension were associated with differences in fibrillin-1 fragment levels. Fibrillin-2 fragments were detected more often in the thoracic aneurysm and dissection groups than in the emergency department chest pain group (P < .0001). Patients with aortic dissection demonstrated a trend toward increased detectability (P = .051) and concentrations (P = .06) of fibrillin-2 fragments compared with patients with aortic aneurysms. Analysis of specific antibody pairs identified fibrillin-1 B15-HRP26 and fibrillin-2 B205-HRP143 as the most informative in distinguishing between the emergency department and aortic pathology groups. Patients with thoracic aortic dissections demonstrated elevated plasma fibrillin-2 fragment levels (B205-HRP143) compared with patients presenting with ischemic or nonischemic cardiac chest pain and increased fibrillin-1 levels (B15-HRP26) compared with patients with ischemic cardiac chest pain. Investigation of fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 fragment generation might lead to diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic advances for patients with thoracic aortic dissection."

    "title": "Thoraflex Hybrid vs. AMDS: To replace the arch or to stent it in type A aortic dissection?",
    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a life-threatening medical emergency that requires urgent surgical intervention. The mainstay surgical approach to treating ATAAD with aortic arch involvement is total arch replacement (TAR). The frozen elephant trunk (FET) procedure involves TAR with hybrid endovascular stenting of the DTA in a single step using a hybrid prosthesis (HP). The prime example of a FET HP is Thoraflex Hybrid Prosthesis (THP). Another treatment option is the novel Ascyrus Medical Dissection Stent (AMDS) that is deployed as a non-covered stent along with the aortic arch as an adjunct to prior hemi-arch replacement. This comparative review highlights the clinical applications and outcomes of THP and AMDS in the treatment of ATAAD and discusses the main differences between both approaches. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using multiple electronic databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, Ovid, Scopus and Embase. TAR with FET can be considered the superior approach to managing ATAAD with arch involvement relative to AMDS with hemi-arch replacement due to more optimal clinical outcomes. Upon comprehensively searching the literature, early mortality was substantially lower with FET ranging from 0-11% compared to 12.5-18.7% using AMDS, with more favourable long-term survival. The incidence of kidney injury and new stroke post-FET ranged from 3-20% and 5-16%, and 11-37.5% and 0-18.8% following AMDS implantation. However, evidence supporting the use of AMDS is extremely limited. Meanwhile, TAR with FET is a well-established and well-described procedure for ATAAD repair. Despite the novel nature of AMDS, its clinical safety and effectiveness are yet to be proven. In conclusion, THP remains the best evidenced-based approach to treat ATAAD in this era."

His neurological deficit gradually recovered, and he was eventually able to walk without support. The combination of CSFD and permissive hypertension could be a first-line emergent treatment for postoperative paraplegia after AADA surgery."

    "title": "Non-prompt surgery for patients with acute type A aortic dissection without pre-operative shock and malperfusion.",
    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) requires urgent surgical treatment. However, during daily practice, there were some patients with ATAAD sought for medical attention several days after symptoms occurred and some other patients hesitated to receive aortic surgery after the diagnosis of ATAAD was made. This study aims to investigate the surgical outcomes of non-prompt aortic surgery (delayed diagnosis caused by the patient or delayed surgery despite immediate diagnosis) for ATAAD patients. From November 2004 to June 2020, of more than 200 patients with ATAAD patients who underwent aortic surgery at our hospital, there were 30 patients without pre-operative shock and malperfusion who sought for medical attention with symptoms for several days or delayed aortic surgery several days later despite ATAAD was diagnosed. Of the 30 patients (median age 60.9, range 33.4~82.5 years) in the study group, there were 18 patients undergoing surgery when they arrived at our hospital (delayed diagnosis by the patient) and 12 patients receiving surgery days later (delayed surgery despite immediate diagnosis). Patients with prompt surgery after symptom onset (control group) were matched from our database by propensity score matching. The surgical mortality rate and post-operative morbidities were compared between the study group and control group. The in-hospital mortality was 3.3% for the study group and 6.7% for the control group (p = non-significant). The incidence of post-operative cerebral permanent neurological defect was 0% for the study group and 13.3% for the control group (p = 0.112). There were three patients receiving aortic re-intervention or re-do aortic surgery during follow-up for the study group and two patients for the control group. Prompt surgery for ATAAD is usually a good choice if everything is well prepared. Besides, urgent but non-prompt aortic surgery could also provide acceptable surgical results for ATAAD patients without pre-operative shock and malperfusion who did not seek medical attention or who could not make their minds to undergo surgery immediately after symptom onset. Hospitalization with intensive care is very important for pre-operative preparation and monitoring for the patients who decline prompt aortic surgery."

    "title": "Type A Aortic Dissection Presenting as Acute Coronary Syndrome in a Young Male Patient: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Type A aortic dissection (AD) is a devastating cardiovascular emergency requiring emergent surgical intervention. Most patients with AD have several risk factors for the disease including longstanding hypertension, smoking history, atherosclerosis, and old age. Younger patients may also present with AD if a genetic disorder affecting the integrity of the aorta is present. This case presents an otherwise healthy 36-year-old male with no known significant family history who presented with an atypical presentation of aortic dissection. He described a five-day history of chest pressure made worse with exertion followed by progressive dyspnea which prompted him to seek medical attention. His initial laboratory workup revealed an elevated troponin I level which prompted a cardiology consultation in the emergency department. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed dilatation of the aortic root and aortic regurgitation. CT angiography of the chest was performed revealing a type A dissection beginning at the aortic root and terminating proximal to the right brachiocephalic artery. Involvement of the coronary arteries was suspected due to the elevated troponin I. He was taken to the operating room and underwent aortic grafting, right coronary artery bypass, and repair of the left main artery. Unfortunately, at the end of the operation, the patient went into refractory ventricular fibrillation, which progressed to asystole. He was unable to be revived."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a rare condition but represents a time-sensitive disease for which a wrong and untimely identification in the triage phase could compromise the subsequent diagnostic, therapeutic path and patient's prognosis. The emergency nurse plays a crucial role in identifying and managing patients with possible AAD. The aim of this paper is to describe the emergency department nursing approach to critical patients with suspected hyperacute/acute AAD. It is crucial to examine the emergency departments nursing approach to patients with suspected AAD. It is fundamental to have a rapid and standardized approach related to life-saving procedures, practices, and management of critical patients during the triage phase, with the assessment of the most common presentation of clinical signs and symptoms and patient management during each step in the emergency department. Early identification and diagnosis in ED allow prompt treatment that improves prognosis. The emergency nurse plays a crucial role in correctly identifying and managing patients with acute aortic dissection. High clinical suspicion from the triage stages, early diagnosis, monitoring, and initial clinical stabilization in the emergency department plays a key role while awaiting definitive treatment."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is one of the causes of acute ischemic stroke. Endovascular recanalization therapy (EVT) has emerged as an essential treatment for acute ischemic stroke due to large artery occlusion. However, it is rarely performed in the situation of hidden aortic dissection (AD). Two patients presented to the emergency room with focal neurologic deficits. The first patient was diagnosed with right internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion. Angiography revealed that the ICA was occluded by the dissection flap. After a stent deployment in the proximal ICA, the antegrade flow was restored. The patient was diagnosed with AD on chest computed tomography (CT) after EVT. For the second patient, intraarterial thrombectomy was performed to treat left middle cerebral artery occlusion. AD was first detected on echocardiography, which was performed after EVT. Herein, we report successful endovascular recanalization therapy performed in two patients with acute ischemic stroke in the situation of undiagnosed aortic dissection. We also reviewed previous case reports and relevant literature."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection can be fatal if overlooked, and the absence of D-dimer elevation can be used to exclude acute aortic dissection. However, we report a case of acute aortic dissection without D-dimer elevation. A man in his 70s presented to the emergency department with lumbar back pain. D-dimer was <1.0 µg/mL; however, acute aortic dissection was strongly suspected because of the sudden onset of lumbar back pain with a shifting location. Because of a difference in systolic blood pressure in both upper extremities, we performed a thorough examination using contrast-enhanced CT, leading to a diagnosis of acute aortic dissection. The patient was immediately referred to cardiovascular surgery and treated conservatively with antihypertensive management. The aortic dissection detection risk score (ADD-RS) classified the patient as high risk. This suggests the importance of using the D-dimer with the ADD-RS rather than solely relying on the D-dimer results to diagnose acute aortic dissection."

The evidence regarding left subclavian artery revascularization in patients undergoing elective or emergent TEVAR with left subclavian artery coverage is weak, and there is ongoing debate whether revascularization should be performed routinely of selectively. Beyond this debate, there is a lack of data about left subclavian artery coverage during TEVAR in end-stage renal disease patients with a functional left upper limb atreriovenous fistula. We present the case of a patient with a left distal radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula who underwent emergent TEVAR with left subclavian artery coverage for ruptured type B aortic dissection. The arteriovenous fistula remains functional on a 3-month follow-up, and the patient did not develop symptoms related to posterior stroke, spinal cord ischemia, limb ischemia, or vertebrobasilar insufficiency."

Targeted treatment of new SCI symptoms after TEVAR (rescue therapy [RT]) might improve/resolve neurologic symptoms but few data characterize the association of specific interventions with SCI outcomes. We evaluated the effectiveness of post-TEVAR RT at our tertiary aortic center. Our institutional TEVAR database was reviewed for SCI incidence and details of RT. This included cerebrospinal fluid drainage (CSFD), medical therapy, and optimization of spinal cord oxygen delivery. SCI outcomes were categorized at discharge as paralysis/paraparesis and temporary/permanent. Nine hundred forty-three TEVAR procedures were performed in 869 patients from 2011 to 2020. Post-TEVAR SCI occurred in 7.8% (n = 74) with permanent paraplegia in 1.5%. Older patient age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and previous abdominal aortic surgery were predictive of SCI. Half (n = 37) of SCI episodes resulted in only temporary paralysis/paraparesis. Rescue postoperative cerebrospinal fluid drains were implanted in 3.7% (n = 35) of procedures and was predicted by higher American Society of Anesthesiologists class, lower serum hemoglobin level, elevated international normalized ratio, bilateral iliac artery occlusion, nonelective procedures, and penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer/intramural hematoma indication. The most commonly used RTs were emergent placement of or increased drainage from an existing cerebrospinal fluid drain (87.8%), induced/permissive hypertension (77.0%), corticosteroid bolus (36.5%), and naloxone infusion (33.8%). Neurologic improvement occurred in 68.9% (n = 51/74). New/increased drainage was associated with improved SCI outcome. Permanent paraplegia from post-TEVAR SCI is rare (1.5%). Older patients with comorbidities carry greater post-TEVAR SCI risk. SCI symptoms improved/resolved with CSFD and multimodal RT in 68.9% of patients, but no intervention was independently associated with improvement. TEVAR centers should have robust protocols for timely and safe CSFD placement to augment RT strategies for SCI."

This meta-analysis aimed to compare clinical outcomes using MiHACP or MoHACP. Studies comparing outcomes of MiHACP or MoHACP in adult aortic arch surgery were searched from four databases from inception through April 2022. Primary outcomes were postoperative permanent neurological deficit (PND), temporary neurological deficit (TND), and mortality. Secondary outcomes included other common complications. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model in all cases. Eleven comparative studies were included, with 1555 patients in MiHACP group and 1499 patients in MoHACP group, and the mean HCA temperature were 29.4°C and 24.8°C, respectively. Postoperative PND, TND, mortality, paraplegia, dialysis, tracheotomy, reexploration for bleeding, and chest tube drainage volume were comparable in the two groups (p > 0.05). Ventilator time, intensive care unit and in-hospital length of stay were shorter in MiHACP group (p < 0.05). Outcomes were also comparable or had some benefits in MiHACP group when subgroup analyses were conducted according to hemiarch or total arch replacement, unilateral or bilateral SACP, HCA time, emergency aortic dissection surgery, and concomitant procedure. The present meta-analysis showed acceptability of MiHACP in adult aortic arch surgery. Results need to be taken with caution as moderate risk of bias and very low quality of evidence were observed in this meta-analysis. Randomized controlled trials are needed for further analysis."

We retrospectively compared the effects on outcomes of single arterial cannulation via axillary artery (AAC) with double arterial cannulation via axillary and femoral artery (DAC) in patients who underwent cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for ATAAD.Methods: Between January 2017 and May 2021, four hundred 29 patients who underwent aortic arch repair with circulatory arrest for ATAAD were divided into AAC group (n = 283) and DAC group (n = 146). The propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis were performed to compare the characteristics and outcomes of the groups.Results: After PSM (n = 137 in each), the DAC group had a longer duration of CPB (229 vs 244, p = 0.011), aortic cross-clamp time (121 vs 149, p < 0.001), durations of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay (7 vs 8, p = 0.014) and hospital stay (19 vs 25, p < 0.001) compared with AAC group.

    "abstract": "This article describes the author's experience using Swanson Care Theory in the provision of nursing care to a 20-year-old man, an exchange student from Hong Kong, following his initial diagnosis with Marfan's syndrome. This patient required emergency aortic root replacement surgery due to type A aortic dissection. Immediately after learning of his illness, the patient was faced with making a major surgical decision. The absence of relatives and friends close by to assist him made him unable to decide whether to agree to the operation. Because of the importance of evaluating the physical and mental needs of the case, which would affect his prognosis, the author conducted a four-facet physical, psychological, social, and spiritual assessment of the patient from April 13-18, 2020. The results confirmed the presence of significant health problems, including \"body image disturbance\" and \"anxiety\". The author applied the five processes of Swanson's caring theory in caring for this patient. The process of \"Knowing\" and \"Being with\" helped, through active companionship and care, establish a trusting relationship, elucidate the client's inner thoughts on the disease, evaluate the client's needs, and accept the negative emotions. The process of \"Doing for\" and \"Enabling\" were employed to serve as a bridge for family communication to help both parties achieve consensus and to encourage effective problem-facing, provide timely assistance, promote self-adjustment, and reduce psychological shock, unease, and anxiety. Health education was implemented to increase the patient's disease and postoperative-care knowledge and promote self-care abilities to facilitate his acceptance of the current situation and active participation in treatment. Finally, the process of \"Maintaining belief\" was used to elicit positive feedback through actual situations. Patients with conditions similar to this patient were introduced to share their experiences and provide empathy to provide our patient with the motivation necessary to maintain positive progress. Based on this experience, it is recommended that critical caregivers strengthen their caring ability to improve their quality of care.

We hypothesize that the SCI index has prognostic implication in predicting operative mortality for patients with acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD). This study aims to investigate the prognostic value of the SCI index and to establish an SCI-adding nomogram for mortality prediction in ATAAD patients. A total of 1,967 ATAAD patients surgically repaired were collected from 12 Chinese cardiovascular centers by the 5A (Additive Anti-inflammatory Action for Aortopathy & Arteriopathy [Multicenter Retrospective Study]) study III (2016-2020). SCI index was calculated as platelet count × fibrinogen/white blood cell count on admission. By adding SCI index, a nomogram was developed and evaluated for 90-day mortality prediction with conventional predictors via the Cox model with 10-fold cross-validation. Patients were stratified with low SCI (<40), middle SCI (40-100), or high SCI (>100). The 90-day survival rates increased with SCI index (low 86.9%; [95% CI: 84.9%-89.0%], middle 92.7% [95% CI: 90.9%-94.9%], and high 96.4% [95% CI: 94.2%-98.6%]; log-rank P < 0.001). SCI index is independently associated with 90-day mortality (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.549; 95% CI: 0.424-0.710; P < 0.001). The addition of SCI index provided significantly incremental prognostic value to base model including age, serum creatinine, DeBakey class, and location of intimal entry (area under the curve: 0.677; 95% CI: 0.641-0.716 vs 0.724; 95% CI: 0.685-0.760; P = 0.002), which was confirmed by net reclassification improvement index (0.158; 95% CI: 0.065-0.235; P < 0.001) and integrated discrimination improvement index (0.070; 95% CI: 0.007-0.036; P < 0.001). SCI index is easily obtainable, performs moderately well as a predictor of short-term mortality in ATAAD patients, and may be useful for risk stratification in emergency settings.

Young patients with AD usually have heritable connective tissue diseases such as Marfan syndrome and Loeys-Dietz syndrome. However, young AD patients without heritable connective tissue disease are relatively rare. Herein, we report a case of a 25-year-old female diagnosed with ATAAD accompanied by undeveloped secondary sexual characteristics. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed that her AD involved the ascending and abdominal aorta. She had undergone thoracic endovascular aortic stent graft implantation in a local hospital due to acute Stanford type B aortic dissection at age 19. No uterus or ovaries were found on CTA and transabdominal ultrasonography. Sex hormone detection revealed a low estrogen level. G-banded karyotyping analyses revealed a normal 46,XX karyotype. Finally, her abnormalities in the reproductive system were diagnosed as MRKH syndrome and 46,XX gonadal dysgenesis. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) in the patient found an SNP variant of ACTA2 c.773G>A and MYH11 c.5081A>G. MYH11 c.5081A>G was also found in her mother and younger brother. Copy number variations sequencing (CNV-seq) found an approximately 109.30 Kb duplication at chromosome 6p22.3 (Chr 6: g.24920238-25029535) with a copy number of 3. We performed emergent total aortic arch replacement with frozen elephant trunk surgery, and the patient recovered well after surgery. However, her abdominal AD was stilling progression during 6 months of follow-up. To our knowledge, we report the world's first case of early-onset recurrent AD combined with MRKH syndrome and 46,XX gonadal dysgenesis."

This case report describes a 30-year-old female at 38 weeks of gestation who presented with acute onset chest pain and hypotension responsive to intravenous fluid therapy. Transthoracic echocardiogram and chest computed tomography angiography confirmed a type A aortic dissection. The patient was transported urgently to the operating room for a Cesarean section and aortic dissection repair. Following induction of general anesthesia, the baby was delivered, oxytocin infusion was started, and a Bakri balloon was placed in the uterus. On cardiopulmonary bypass with circulatory arrest, the ascending aorta and aortic valve were repaired. Multiple uterotonic agents were required intraoperatively to manage persistent uterine bleeding in the setting of full heparinization. Both mother and baby survived without major complications. Preoperative management should focus on maternal hemodynamic control while completing a diagnostic evaluation. Intraoperative considerations include minimizing fetal exposure to medication, maintaining hemodynamic stability, and managing intraoperative blood loss in the setting of full anticoagulation."

Cardiac surgery (37.8%) and percutaneous coronary intervention (36.9%) were the most frequent causes leading to iatrogenic TAAD, followed by diagnostic coronary angiography (13.6%), transcatheter aortic valve replacement (10.7%) and peripheral endovascular procedure (1.0%). In hospital mortality was 20.5% after cardiac surgery, 31.6% after percutaneous coronary intervention, 42.9% after diagnostic coronary angiography, 45.5% after transcatheter aortic valve replacement and nihil after peripheral endovascular procedure (p = 0.092), with similar 5-year mortality between different subgroups of iatrogenic TAAD (p = 0.710). Among 102 propensity score matched pairs, in-hospital mortality was significantly higher among patients with iatrogenic TAAD (30.4% vs. 15.7%, p = 0.013) compared to those with spontaneous TAAD. This finding was likely related to higher risk of postoperative heart failure (35.3% vs. 10.8%, p < 0.0001) among iatrogenic TAAD patients. Five-year mortality was comparable between patients with iatrogenic and spontaneous TAAD (46.2% vs. 39.4%, p = 0.163). (4) Conclusions: Iatrogenic origin of acute TAAD is quite uncommon but carries a significantly increased risk of in-hospital mortality compared to spontaneous TAAD."

    "abstract": "Most patients with acute aortic dissection (AAD) have a history of hypertension. Diagnosis of AAD in patients with hypertension at an early stage is complicated and challenging. This study aimed to explore the distinctive metabolic changes in plasma samples of AAD patients with hypertension and patients with hypertension only and provide early identification and diagnosis of AAD in patients with hypertension. We collected blood samples from 20 patients with type A AAD and hypertension admitted to the emergency department and physically examined other 20 patients with hypertension as controls. The plasma metabolomic profiles of these patients were determined using untargeted metabolomics with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A total of 38 metabolites that differed between the AAD and hypertension groups were screened. In the positive ion mode, 12 metabolites were different between the two groups, and in the negative ion mode, 26 metabolites were different. Among the 26 different metabolites detected by the negative ion mode, 21 were significantly upregulated and five were downregulated in patients with AAD compared to patients with hypertension. Moreover, five metabolites were upregulated and seven were significantly downregulated in patients with AAD compared to those with hypertension, as detected by the positive ion mode. The metabolites differentially expressed in AAD were mainly involved in lipid metabolism (fatty acid biosynthesis, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, and linoleic acid metabolism), carbohydrate metabolism (galactose, fructose, and mannose metabolisms), and membrane transport (ATP-binding cassette transporters). Interestingly, plasma hydrocortisone and dimethylglycine concentrations were significantly increased in patients with type A AAD, with the highest area under the curve value (AUC = 0.9325 or 0.9200, respectively) tested by the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. This study provides possible metabolic markers for the early clinical diagnosis of AAD in patients with hypertension."

From 1996 to 2019, among 760 consecutive acute type A aortic dissection patients 512 patients had no malperfusion syndrome (Non-MPS), whereas 26 patients had LE-MPS with/without renal MPS and underwent endovascular fenestration/stenting, open aortic repair, or both. Patients with coronary, cerebral, mesenteric, and celiac MPS, or managed with thoracic endovascular aortic repair, were excluded (n = 222). All patients with LE-MPS underwent upfront endovascular fenestration/stenting except 1 patient (with signs of rupture) who initially underwent emergency open aortic repair. Among the LE-MPS patients, 17 (65%) had LE pain, 15 (58%) had abnormal motor function with 8 (31%) having paralysis, 10 (38%) had LE pallor, 17 (65%) had LE paresthesia, and 20 (77%) had LE pulselessness. Of the 25 patients undergoing upfront endovascular fenestration/stenting, 16 went on to open aortic repair, 3 survived to discharge without aortic repair, and 6 died before aortic repair (3-aortic rupture and 3-organ failure). In-hospital mortality among all patients was significantly higher in the LE-MPS group (31% vs 6.3%; P = .0003). Among those undergoing open aortic repair, postoperative outcomes were similar between groups, including operative mortality (18% vs 6.5%; P = .10). LE-MPS was a significant risk factor for in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 6.0 [1.9, 19]; P = .002). In acute type A aortic dissection, LE-MPS was associated with high in-hospital mortality. Emergency revascularization with endovascular fenestration/stenting followed by delayed open aortic repair may be a reasonable approach."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a connective tissue disorder involving multiple organs. The most severe complications include aortic root dilatation and dissection. In the present report, we provide an uncommon case of acute aortic Stanford type A dissection (AADA) repair with severe scoliosis in an MFS patient and it is even more rare for such surgical treatment to be successfully completed along with holistic management that enables the patient to recover successfully. We offer a reference for future surgical therapy since the specific surgical treatment methods in this case have not been reported in the literature. A 40-year-old Chinese female with MFS was rushed to our surgical clinic due to the sudden onset of intense chest pain. Physical examination revealed a diastolic murmur at the aortic valve area, increased arm and pectus carinatum deformity, severe scoliosis, acromicria, arachnodactyly, and planovalgus foot. Subsequently, AADA was discovered through computed tomography scan. In addition, echocardiogram revealed moderate aortic regurgitation and hydropericardium in small amount. Based on revised Ghent criteria, the patient was diagnosed with MFS complicated with aortic dissection. Emergency surgery was successfully performed for repair of the patient's aortic dissection and the diseased aortic valve. Postoperatively, the patient presented with a degree of respiratory insufficiency. However, the respiratory function was not greatly impaired, with good early intervention, such as taking deep breaths and coughing fully, active sputum suction, effective analgesia, ambulation and treadmill exercise. The patient finally recovered completely and was discharged 3 weeks later. We reported on a patient with severe scoliosis who successfully underwent surgical repair of AADA. Our report shows that the application of standard median sternotomy for repairing AADA offers the feasibility of implementation, on the basis of effectively solving various practical problems in the surgery brought about by scoliosis. It has been thoroughly assessed and addressed how the postoperative condition of such patients affects subsequent respiratory function and postoperative recovery. This report further provides a successful clinical reference for the implementation of this type of surgery and the postoperative management of respiratory function."

    "abstract": "To investigate the effect of shift work on surgical outcomes at different times in patients with acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD). Patients with ATAAD who underwent total arch replacement at Qilu Hospital of Shandong University from January 2015 to March 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients were managed according to the green channel emergency management strategy, and a professional cardiac team was arranged during off-hours. Based on surgery time and symptom onset to procedure time, the patients were divided into weekday, weekend and holiday groups; daytime and nighttime groups; intervention time ≤48 h and >48 h groups; working hours and off-hours groups. In-hospital mortality between these groups was compared. In total, 499 ATAAD patients underwent surgery within 7 days of symptom onset, and the in-hospital mortality rate was 10% (n = 50/499). Among the 499 patients, 320 (64.13%), 128 (25.65%) and 51 (10.22%) underwent surgery on weekdays, weekends and holidays, respectively. In-hospital mortality and 7-day mortality showed no significant difference among the three groups. Two hundred twenty-seven (45.5%) underwent daytime surgery, and 272 (54.5%) underwent nighttime surgery. Durations of ICU stay and hospital stay were significantly different between the two groups (P < 0.05). There was no significant differences in in-hospital mortality (9.2% vs. 10.7%) and 7-day mortality (4.4% vs. 6.6%). 221 patients (44.3%) and 278 patients (55.7%) were included in the intervention time ≤48 h and >48 h groups, respectively. Acute renal injury, ICU stay and hospital stay were significantly different (P < 0.05) whereas 7-day mortality (5.0% vs. 6.1%) and in-hospital mortality (8.6% vs. 11.1%) were not. Furthermore, 7-day (1.9% vs. 6.6%) and in-hospital mortality (11.1% vs. 9.8%) showed no difference between working hours group (n = 108) and off-hours group (n = 391). Cox regression analysis showed that postoperative acute renal injury (HR = 2.423; 95% CI, 1.214-4.834; P = 0.012), pneumonia (HR = 2.542; 95% CI, 1.186-5450; P = 0.016) and multiple organ dysfunction (HR = 11.200; 95% CI, 5.549-22.605; P = 0.001) were the main factors affecting hospital death in ATAAD patients. Under the management of a professional cardiac surgery team with dedicated off-hours shifts, surgery time was not related to in-hospital mortality in ATAAD patients."

Mounting evidence indicates obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as an independent risk factor for AD development with unknown mechanisms. This study aims to establish a stable murine model of OSA-related AD (OSA-AD) and uncover the potential changes in gene transcripts in OSA-AD. ApoE-/- mice were exposed to the chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) system combined with Ang II administration to establish the OSA-AD model. Pathological staining was performed to exhibit the physiological structure of the mouse aorta. The SBC mouse ceRNA microarray was used to identify significantly differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs, DE long-non-coding RNAs (DElncRNAs), and DE circular RNAs (DEcircRNAs) in OSA-AD tissues. Subsequently, bioinformatics analysis, including Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG), and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses, were performed to evaluate the function of the significantly differentially expressed transcripts (DETs). The hub genes were confirmed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). ApoE-/- mice exposed to CIH and Ang II showed a high ratio of aortic accident (73.33%) and significant aortic diameter dilatation (1.96 ± 0.175 mm). A total of 1,742 mRNAs, 2,625 lncRNAs, and 537 circRNAs were identified as DETs (LogFC ≥ 1.5 or ≤ -1.5, P < 0.05). GO and KEGG analyses demonstrated that the differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) were most enriched in cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, inflammation, and hypoxia-related terms, which are closely related to aortic structural homeostasis. The PPI network contained 609 nodes and 934 connections, the hub genes were highlighted with the CytoHubba plugin and confirmed by qRT-PCR in AD tissues. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the cis-regulated genes of DElncRNAs and circRNAs-host genes were enriched in aortic structural homeostasis-related pathways. Our findings help establish a de novo OSA-AD animal model using ApoE-/- mice. Many DEmRNAs, DElncRNAs, and DEcircRNAs were screened for the first time in OSA-AD tissues. Our findings provide useful bioinformatics data for understanding the molecular mechanism of OSA-AD and developing potential therapeutic strategies for OSA-AD."

A multicenter retrospective cohort study from January 2007 to December 2021. A total of 399 patients underwent emergency acute aortic dissection repair. Propensity score matching was used to adjust for the type of surgery and other patient characteristics. A total of 387 of the eligible 399 patients were included in this study and propensity score matching yielded 94 patients for whom characteristics were not significantly different between the two groups. The type of surgery was exactly matched (ascending aorta replacement: 19 [40%]; partial arch replacement: 13 [28%]; total arch replacement: 15 [32%] in each group). Within the matched cohort, there was a statistically significant difference in the volume of intraoperative blood transfusion. (AQUABRID vs. control: 34 [26-38] vs. 50 [38-60] U in Japan, p = .03). Operating time was significantly shorter in the AQUABRID group (total operation: mean ± SD, 343 ± 92 vs. 402 ± 161 min, p = .03; reconstruction for arch vessels: 29 ± 17 vs. 56 ± 22, p < .01). The rate of postoperative complications was comparable in the two groups. Failure to use AQUABRID was a significant predictor of the need for massive transfusion (>40 U) (odds ratio: 7.20; 95% confidence interval: 2.56-20.23; p < .01). The use of AQUABRID during emergency acute aortic dissection repair significantly decreased the volume of intraoperative blood transfusion and the duration of surgery."

Between 01/2011 and 12/2020 our centre performed 4043 TAVI procedures. Twenty-seven patients (including patients in whom TAVI was performed in other centres) underwent subsequent open-heart surgery via cardiopulmonary bypass. Demographic, intraprocedural data, indications for, and outcomes after surgery were evaluated. Indications for cardiac surgery (aged 79 [IQR 76-84]; 59.3% male) were endocarditis (n = 11; 40.7%), annular rupture, severe paravalvular leak and severe stenosis in three (11.1%) patients, respectively as well as in one patient each (3.7%) severe tricuspid valve regurgitation, valve thrombosis, valve malposition, valve migration, ostial right coronary artery obstruction, left ventricular rupture and type A aortic dissection. The interval between the index TAVI procedure to open surgery was 3 months (IQR 0-26 months). Eight patients underwent emergent surgical conversions. Immediate procedural and procedural mortality was 25.9% and 40.7%, respectively and all-cause mortality was 51.9% (11/12 died for cardiovascular reasons). No disabling stroke was observed postoperatively. New permanent pacemaker implantation was required in three patients (11.1%). Subsequent open-cardiac surgery after TAVI is rare, but may urgently become necessary due to TAVI related complications or progressing other cardiac pathologies. Despite a substantial early attrition rate clinical outcome is acceptable and a relevant number of these high-risk patients can be discharged even after emergency conversions. The option of subsequent surgical conversion remains."

This was an observational study of consecutive aortic surgeries from 2007 to 2021. Kaplan-Meier survival estimation and multivariable Cox regression analysis were performed to assess the impact of reoperative versus first-time sternotomy upon survival after ATAAD repair. A total of 601 patients with ATAAD were identified, of which 72 (12%) underwent reoperative sternotomy. The reoperative group had a higher prevalence of baseline comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. Central cannulation of the aorta was achieved at a similar rate across each group (81.9% vs. 81.5%, p = .923), and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time was similar across each group (204 ± 84.8 vs. 203 ± 72.4 min, p = .923). Postoperative outcomes were similar across both groups, including in-hospital mortality, stroke, pulmonary complications, renal failure, and reexploration for excessive bleeding. Five-year survival was 74.5% (70.5, 78.3) for the first-time group and was 71.6% (60.0, 81.9) for the reoperative group. After multivariable Cox regression, reoperative sternotomy was not significantly associated with an increased hazard of death compared to first-time sternotomy (hazards ratio: 0.90, 95% confidence interval: 0.56, 1.43, p = .642). These findings suggest that re-sternotomy can be safely performed with similar outcomes as first-time sternotomy. Central initiation of CPB after sternal reentry limits CPB time and may therefore represent a protective strategy that enhances outcomes for patients presenting with ATAAD and prior cardiac surgery."

    "abstract": "In the last two decades, a more aggressive approach has been encouraged to treat patients with acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD), extending the repair to the aortic arch and proximal descending thoracic aorta with the frozen elephant trunk (FET) implantation. Here, we report our single-centre experience with the FET technique for the systematic treatment of emergency type A aortic dissection. Between December 2017 and January 2022, 69 consecutive patients were admitted with ATAAD; of those, 66 patients (62.9 ± 10.2 years of age, 81.8% men) underwent emergency hybrid aortic arch and FET repair with the multibranched Thoraflex hybrid graft and were enrolled in the study. Primary endpoints were 30 days- and in-hospital mortality. Secondary endpoints were postoperative morbidity and follow-up survival. To better clarify the impact of age on surgical outcomes, we have divided the study population into two groups: group A for patients <70 years of age (47 patients), and group B for patients ≥70 years (19 patients). Time-to-event analysis has been conducted using the Log-rank test and is displayed with Kaplan-Meier curves. A multiple Cox proportional Hazard model was developed to identify predictors of long-term survival with a stepwise backward/forward selection process. 30-days- and in-hospital mortality were 10.6 and 13.6%, respectively. Stroke occurred in three (4.5%) patients. Two (3.0%) patients experienced spinal cord ischemia. We did not find any statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of main post-operative outcomes. The multivariable Cox proportional hazard model showed left ventricular ejection fraction (HR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.79-0.92, p < 0.01), peripheral vascular disease (HR: 15.8, 95% CI: 3.9-62.9, p < 0.01), coronary malperfusion (HR: 0.10, 95% CI: 0.01-0.77, p =0.03), lower limbs malperfusion (HR: 5.1, 95% CI: 1.10-23.4, p = 0.04), and cardiopulmonary bypass time (HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1-1.04, p = 0.01) as independent predictors of long term mortality.

The three conditions can occur alone or in combination with overlapping presentation. Medical, open surgical, and endovascular treatment is tailored depending on clinical presentation, timing, and location within the aorta. Among patients who present with acute IMH affecting the ascending aorta (Type A), urgent open surgical repair is considered the primary line of treatment in patients who are suitable candidates and unstable. The management of IMH in the descending aorta and aortic arch (Type B) is similar to that applied to treat acute dissections in the same segment. Medical treatment with sequential imaging is recommended in patients with uncomplicated course, and endovascular repair is indicated in patients with rupture, persistent pain, end-organ ischemia, or rapid aortic enlargement.

    "abstract": "In this state-of-the-art review, we discuss the presenting symptoms and management strategies for vascular emergencies. Although vascular emergencies are best treated at a vascular surgical centre, patients may present to any emergency department and may require both immediate management and safe transport to a vascular centre. We describe the surgical and anaesthetic considerations for management of aortic dissection, aortic rupture, carotid endarterectomy, acute limb ischaemia and mesenteric ischaemia. Important issues to consider in aortic dissection are extent of the dissection and surgical need for bypasses in addition to endovascular repair. From an anaesthetist's perspective, aortic dissection requires infrastructure for massive transfusion, smooth management should an endovascular procedure require conversion to an open procedure, haemodynamic manipulation during stent deployment and prevention of spinal cord ischaemia. Principles in management of aortic rupture, whether open or endovascular treatment is chosen, include immediate transfer to a vascular care centre; minimising haemodynamic changes to reduce aortic shear stress; permissive hypotension in the pre-operative period; and initiation of massive transfusion protocol. Carotid endarterectomy for carotid stenosis is managed with general or regional techniques, and anaesthetists must be prepared to manage haemodynamic, neurological and airway issues peri-operatively. Acute limb ischaemia is a result of embolism, thrombosis, dissection or trauma, and may be treated with open repair or embolectomy, under either general or local anaesthesia. Due to hypercoagulability, there may be higher numbers of acutely ischaemic limbs among patients with COVID-19, which is important to consider in the current pandemic. Mesenteric ischaemia is a rare vascular emergency, but it is challenging to diagnose and associated with high morbidity and mortality. Several peri-operative issues are common to all vascular emergencies: acute renal injury; management of transfusion; need for heparinisation and reversal; and challenging postoperative care. Finally, the important development of endovascular techniques for repair in many vascular emergencies has improved care, and the availability of transoesophageal echocardiography has improved monitoring as well as aids in surgical placement of endovascular grafts and for post-procedural evaluation."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) is a life-threatening medical emergency that affects an estimated 3-4 people per 100,000 annually, with 40% of cases classified as type B AD (TBAD). TBAD can be further classified as being complicated (co-TBAD) or uncomplicated (un-TBAD) based on the presence or absence of certain features such as malperfusion and rupture. TBAD can be managed conservatively with optimal medical therapy (OMT), or invasively with open surgical repair (OSR) or thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), depending on several factors such as type of TBAD and its clinical acuity. The cost-effectiveness, or cost-benefit profile, of these strategies must be given equal consideration. However, TBAD studies featuring cost analyses are limited within the literature. This narrative review aims to address the gap in the literature on cost-effectiveness of TBAD treatments by providing an overview of cost analyses comparing OMT with TEVAR in un-TBAD and TEVAR with OSR in co-TBAD. Another aim is to provide a market analysis of the commercially available TEVAR devices. A comprehensive literature search was performed using several search engines including PubMed, Ovid, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Embase to identify and extract relevant studies. Several TEVAR devices are available commercially on the global market costing $12,000-19,495. Nevertheless, the Terumo Aortic RELAY® stent graft seems to be the most cost-effective, yielding highly favourable clinical outcomes. Despite the higher initial cost of TEVAR, evidence in the literature strongly suggest that it is superior to OMT for un-TBAD on the long-term. In addition, TEVAR is well established in the literature as being gold-standard repair technique for co-TBAD, replacing OSR by offering a more optimal cost-benefit profile through lower costs and improved results. The introduction of TEVAR has revolutionized the field of aortovascular surgery by offering a highly efficacious and long-term cost-effective treatment for TBAD."

    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic dissection (TAD) is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death associated with aortic diseases. The age of TAD victims in forensic studies is significantly younger than hospitalized patients with TAD, while only a few studies have been conducted on autopsy-diagnosed TAD deceased. A retrospective study was conducted at the Medicolegal Center of Sun Yat-sen University from 1999 to 2019 to address the characteristics of TAD victims. A total of 200 deceased from spontaneous rupture of TAD were assessed, with 165 (82.5%) males and 175 (87.5%) Stanford type A deceased. Our main results showed that compared with patients with TAD diagnosed during their lifetime, individuals diagnosed with TAD until an autopsy showed an earlier onset (43.80 years old) and less accompanied hypertension (<50%). Sudden death was the initial symptom of 32 decedents. Instead of chest/back pain (40 decedents), abdominal pain (59 decedents) was the most common initial symptom, and 42 decedents presented with no accompanying pain. A higher proportion of abdominal pain and the painless symptom was associated with a higher risk of misdiagnosis. Women showed a more atypical clinical presentation and rapid progression than men. Younger decedents showed more pronounced left heart changes. The present study implicated the TAD individuals diagnosed until an autopsy as a particular entity, indicating the urgent need for further investigation on early diagnosis and pathogenesis of patients with TAD with atypical pain and painless or with younger age to reduce the burden of TAD-related sudden death."

    "abstract": "Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is becoming a frequently utilized imaging tool in the emergency department (ED) as it can aid in early diagnosis of many pathologies. This is a case report of a 55-year-old male who presented to the emergency department by ambulance for sudden onset chest pain followed by a syncopal episode. Point-of-care echocardiogram revealed a large pericardial effusion with a significantly dilated aortic root, concerning for aortic dissection. Patient was emergently taken for a computed tomography (CT) scan, which was only remarkable for an ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm but failed to show an aortic dissection flap. On repeat POCUS, a dissection intimal flap, large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology, and aortic regurgitation were identified and later confirmed on transesophageal echocardiogram. This case report details a rare pathology that was correctly identified on initial POCUS before it was seen on CT scan."

    "abstract": "The patient was a 60-year-old woman who underwent thoracoabdominal aorta replacement for type B aortic dissection three years ago and aortic root replacement and total aortic arch replacement due to asymptomatic type A aortic dissection two years previously. Her clinical course was uneventful until follow-up computed tomography (CT) disclosed anastomotic insufficiency in the innominate artery and left main coronary artery stenosis owing to hematoma. Emergent percutaneous coronary intervention and stent graft insertion into the innominate artery were performed successfully. Seven months later, however, CT scan revealed a perforation in the posterior wall of the artificial graft damaged by the edge of the implanted stent graft. The patient underwent open surgery and perforation of artificial graft was sutured and redundant stent graft edge was resected. Artificial graft damage by stent graft placement is rare to date, but may increase in the future in accordance with broader application of endovascular treatment."

    "abstract": "Ever since it was first described in 1760, acute type A aortic dissection has created difficulties in its management. The recent COVID-19 pandemic revealed that extrapulmonary manifestations of this condition may occur, and recent reports suggested that aortic dissection may be amongst them since it shares a common physiopathology, that is, hyper-inflammatory syndrome. Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass in the setting of COVID-19-positive patients carries a high risk of postoperative respiratory failure. While the vast majority accept that management of type A aortic dissection requires urgent surgery and central aortic therapy, there are some reports that advocate for delaying surgery. In this situation, the risk of aortic rupture must be balanced with the possible benefits of delaying urgent surgery. We present a case of acute type A dissection with COVID-19-associated bronchopneumonia successfully managed after delaying surgery for 6 days."

    "title": "Chronic Thoracic Aortic Dissection: How to Treat, When to Intervene.",
    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic dissection (AD) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Acute aortic syndrome is the first presentation of the disease in most cases. While acute AD management follows concrete guidelines because of its urgent and life-threatening nature, chronic AD is usually overlooked, although it concerns a wide spectrum of patients surviving an acute event. Acute AD survivors ultimately enter a chronic aortic disease course. Patients with chronic thoracic AD (CTAD) require lifelong surveillance and a proportion of them may present with symptoms and late complications demanding further surgical or endovascular treatment. However, the available data concerning the management of CTAD is sparse in the literature. The management of patients with CTAD is challenging as far as determining the best medical therapy and deciding on intervention are concerned. Until recently, there were no guidelines or recommendations for imaging surveillance in patients with chronic AD. The diagnostic methods for imaging aortic diseases have been improved, while the data on new endovascular and surgical approaches has increased significantly. In this review, we summarize the current evidence in the diagnosis and management of CTAD and the latest recommendations for the surgical/endovascular aortic repair of CTAD."

    "abstract": "Rationale and Objective: Thoracic CT angiography (CTA) for ascending aortic dissection, a life-threatening emergency, is performed routinely without Electrocardiographic (ECG) gating, therefore allowing the apparition of a pulsation artefact. We aimed to evaluate and compare the diagnostic performance, the inter and intra-reporter agreement of ECG gated CTA and non-ECG gated CTA for detecting ascending aortic dissection, considering their training level. Our hypothesis is that ECG gated CTA has superior diagnostic accuracy for ascending aortic dissection compared to non-gated CTA. Materials and Methods: We collected data using 24 questions survey using clinically validated CT examinations. Sixty-six respondents (medical students, radiology residents, and consultants) blinded to the actual diagnosis independently evaluated the images pertaining to the presence of ascending aortic dissection. The reference standard was represented by clinical and imaging diagnosis. Inter-rater and inter-group concordance was evaluated; the agreement with reference tests was calculated and assessed as a function of reporters’ training level. Results: Reporters’ ascending aortic dissection assessment showed a better correlation with the reference standard in the ECG gated CTA. The inter-rater correlation was higher in the ECG gated CTA compared to non-ECG gated CTA. Observers’ confidence for diagnosing ascending aortic dissection was higher in the ECG gated CTA. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were found between different training levels when assessing non-ECG gated examinations. Conclusions: ECG gated CTA shows a higher diagnostic performance for ascending aortic dissection than non-ECG gated CTA, regardless of the reporters’ training level."

It has anatomical differences compared to antegrade type A aortic dissection that impact the management and prognosis. Treatment is not standardized. We report our approach to spontaneous RTAAD in our institution between 2018 and 2022 (n = 15). The mean age was 60.1 years and 93% were male. Aortic valve, coronary arteries and supra-aortic trunks were spared by the dissection in 80% of the cases; distal extension to iliacs was common and lower limb malperfusion was present in 4 cases (27%). The ascending aorta was dilated at presentation in 60% of the cases. Emergency surgery with arch/FET replacement was offered to 11 patients (73%); 3 patients (20%) received a limited proximal aortic repair; 1 patient was treated conservatively. Overall mortality was 47% (100% for limited proximal repair and 22% for those who received arch/FET). We advocate for aggressive treatment of RTAAD excluding the primary entry tear to prevent immediate- and mid-term complications."

MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched through December 2021 to identify studies that investigated outcomes in MFS patients with TBAD who underwent TEVAR. Data regarding patient characteristics, perioperative and late outcomes were extracted. Twelve studies were identified including 120 patients. The mean age was 40.2 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 36.8-43.6). 40.4% (95% CI: 10.8-70.0) of cases were performed emergently. 76.2% (95% CI: 64.6-87.8) of patients had a history of previous aortic surgery. In-hospital mortality was 3.7% (95% CI: 0.6-6.8). Primary endoleak occurred in 15.2% (95% CI: 8.6-21.8), which was comprised of type 1 (9.3% [95% CI: 3.9-14.6]) and type 2 (7.1% [95% CI: 2.3-12.0]) endoleaks. During mean follow-up period of 37.4 months (95% CI: 24.1-50.7), secondary endoleak was reported in 14.1% (95% CI: 7.1-21.1), which was comprised of type 1 (7.4% [95% CI: 2.4-12.5]) and type 2 (4.0% [95% CI: 0.3-7.7]) endoleak. Repeat TEVAR was performed in 15.5% (95% CI: 9.3-21.8) and open aortic surgery in 18.6% (95% CI: 9.6-27.5). Long-term mortality was 11.9% (95% CI: 6.5-17.3). Our analysis showed that TEVAR for TBAD in patients with MFS has low perioperative morbidity and mortality but was associated with a high rate of late reintervention. This treatment option should be limited to emergent cases and to patients deemed unsuitable for open repair. Lifelong follow-up with imaging is mandatory in this population."

Shortly after having the initial type A aortic dissection repair with replacement of the ascending aorta, the patient developed severe visceral malperfusion due to a compressed distal true lumen and underwent emergency endovascular repair with ascending arch and descending thoracic aorta stents and chimney grafts for the aortic arch vessels as well as fenestration of the intimal flap of the abdominal aorta. Unfortunately, the patient developed permanent paraplegia and progressive symptomatic severe aortic regurgitation. The patient underwent a redo sternotomy, aortic root, and arch replacement with explantation of the ascending stent graft and chimney stent grafts. Antegrade cerebral perfusion was maintained throughout the procedure. The aortic arch was replaced using a Terumo Aortic Plexus multibranched graft distally anastomosed to the endovascular stent graft, and the innominate and left common carotid arteries were reimplanted onto the graft. The aortic root was replaced with a Bioconduit graft, using a modified Cabrol technique to reimplant the left coronary artery. A satisfactory postoperative course and computed tomography imaging highlight the feasibility of this highly complex aortic arch repair with careful preoperative planning."

It is associated with widespread familial arterial aneurysm and rupture. We present a case of a 70-year-old male with a family history of heritable thoracic aortic aneurysm disease who presented to the emergency department with chest pain. His presenting electrocardiogram was significant for ST elevation in the inferior leads with complete heart block. Computed tomography-angiography was done to rule out aortic dissection, which was negative for aortic dissection but did reveal 3.9 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm and 2.7 cm bilateral iliac artery aneurysms. He was then taken for invasive angiography and was found to have aneurysmal dilation of the entire right coronary artery measuring up to 6 mm with 100% occlusion secondary to thrombus in the distal segment. He was found to have obstructive disease in the left anterior descending artery and first and second obtuse marginals (OMs). Genetic testing performed confirmed a pathogenic mutation in the TGFBRI gene (TGFBRI c.934G > A p.Gly312Ser) consistent with the diagnosis of LDS. Although LDS is known to cause arterial aneurysms throughout the arterial tree, there have been no other cases of primary coronary aneurysms reported in this patient population. This case represents the first description of a patient with genetically confirmed LDS presenting with coronary artery aneurysm."

However, the relationship between the incidence of hospitalisation-associated disability (HAD) and acute cardiac rehabilitation in patients after surgery for ATAAD has not been reported. Therefore, this study evaluated factors related to HAD in patients after surgery for ATAAD. This single-centre retrospective observational study included 483 patients who required emergency surgery for ATAAD. HAD occurred in 104 (21.5%) patients following cardiovascular surgery. Factors associated with HAD were age (odds ratio [OR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.09; p = 0.001), noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV; OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.10-4.19; p = 0.025), postoperative delirium (OR, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.60-5.37; p = 0.001), and timing of walking onset (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.07-1.56; p = 0.008). Furthermore, a late walking onset was associated with a higher risk of developing HAD and more severe functional decline. Early rehabilitation based on appropriate criteria has possibility of preventing HAD."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition that confers significant early perioperative risk but is also associated with late aortic disease progression and the need for reintervention. Recent efforts to improve patient outcomes have focused on improving quality of care and extending treatment in the aortic root and arch to reduce late aortic events. The hybrid arch frozen elephant trunk technique facilitates a more aggressive distal aortic repair that may help mitigate the early and late deleterious effects of persistent false lumen perfusion. However, in the acute and emergency settings, management of the left subclavian artery remains a challenge. We present a step-by-step instructional guide on performing an emergency hybrid arch frozen elephant trunk procedure with emphasis on management of the difficult left subclavian artery. Our case report demonstrates a transthoracic aortoaxillary extra-anatomic bypass of the left axillary artery. We discuss the most important considerations when managing the left subclavian artery in an acute type A aortic dissection. Finally, we detail the benefits and limitations of the transthoracic aortoaxillary extra-anatomic technique and discuss other approaches to left subclavian artery reconstruction."

The Ascyrus Medical Dissection Stent was used in combination with the standard surgical management of acute DeBakey type I aortic dissection I to treat patients with (56.5%, 26/46) and without (43.5%, 20/46) preoperative clinical and radiographic malperfusion. All patients had a primary entry tear in the ascending aorta, and 97.8% (45/46) were treated with a hemiarch repair. Median follow-up was 3 years. All 47 patients underwent emergency surgical repair with successful Ascyrus Medical Dissection Stent implantation. One patient was excluded from analysis due to use in iatrogenic dissection. Overall mortality at 30 days and 3 years was 13.0% (6/46) and 21.7% (10/46), respectively. Overall new stroke rate at 30 days was 15.2% (7/46). No devices were explanted at any time during the 3-year median follow-up. At 3 years, the total aortic diameter in zones 0, 1, and 2 decreased or remained stable in 91.7%, 72.7%, and 75.0%, respectively. The false lumen was completely or partially thrombosed in 90.5% in zone 0, 60.0% in zone 1, and 68.2% in zone 2 at 3 years. The use of the Ascyrus Medical Dissection Stent in the treatment of acute DeBakey type I aortic dissection I holds promise as a simple technology that enables repair of the aortic arch and proximal descending aorta, while promoting positive aortic remodeling. Ongoing follow-up of the Dissected Aorta Repair Through Stent Implantation trial will provide long-term, prospective, clinical outcomes and radiographic data on positive remodeling of the aortic arch."

However, there is little literature on the relationship between PDW and postoperative pneumonia in patients with type A acute aortic dissection (AAAD). In this retrospective cohort study, we collected consecutive patients who underwent emergency surgery for AAAD at Xiangya Hospital of Central South University from January 1, 2014 and June 30, 2020. Patients were divided into three tertiles on the basis of the PDW. The independent effect of the PDW on postoperative pneumonia was evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis, and smooth curve fitting was performed to visualize the linear relationship between PDW and the risk of postoperative pneumonia in patients with AAAD. A total of 210 patients with AAAD were enrolled and the overall incidence of postoperative pneumonia was 25.24% (n = 53). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that PDW was positively associated with the risk of postoperative pneumonia (OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.02-1.13, P < 0.05) after adjusting the confounders. Compared with the lowest PDW tertile, the risk of postoperative pneumonia increased by 1.21-fold in the medium PDW tertile (OR: 2.21, 95% CI: 0.73-6.72) and by 3.16-fold in the highest PDW tertile (OR: 4.16, 95% CI: 1.40-12.33). A straight-line relationship was observed between PDW and postoperative pneumonia risk in smoothing spline fitting. Our findings indicate that high PDW is an independent risk factor of postoperative pneumonia in patients with AAAD. Preoperative PDW may serve as an available indicator of pneumonia, which helps identify AAAD patients with a high risk of postoperative pneumonia."

    "abstract": "Aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA) is the most common congenital anomaly of the aortic arch. When patients having such anomalies receive transradial intervention (TRI), aortic dissection (AD) may occur. Herein, we discuss a case of iatrogenic type B AD occurring during right TRI in an ARSA patient, that was later salvaged by percutaneous angioplasty. A 73-year-old man presented to our hospital with intermittent chest pain. Coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography revealed significant stenosis in the left anterior descending artery. Diagnostic coronary angiography was performed via the right radial artery without difficulty. However, we were unable to advance the guiding catheter past the ostium of the right subclavian artery to the aortic arch for percutaneous coronary intervention, while the guidewire tended to go down the descending aorta. The patient suddenly complained of chest and back pain. Emergent CT aortography revealed type B AD propagating to the left renal artery (RA) with preserved renal perfusion. However, after 2 d, the patient suddenly complained of right lower limb pain where the femoral pulse was suddenly undetectable. Follow-up CT indicated further progression of dissection to the right external iliac artery (EIA) and left RA with limited flow. We performed percutaneous angioplasty of the right EIA and left RA without complications. Follow-up CT aortography at 8 mo showed optimal results. A caution is required during right TRI in ARSA to avoid AD. Percutaneous angioplasty can be a treatment option."

This single-center retrospective study analysed the long-term performance of the native aortic valve and root following surgery for ATAAD. Between 2009 and 2018 all cases ATAAD treated at Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust were analysed. Patients were divided into two groups: (a) ascending aorta (interposition) graft (AAG) without valve replacement and (b) nonvalve-sparing aortic root replacement (ARR). Preoperative covariates were compared, as well as operative characteristics and postoperative complications. Long-term survival and echocardiographic outcomes were analysed using regression analysis. In total, 116 patients were included: 63 patients in the AAG group and 53 patients in the ARR group. In patients where the native aortic valve was conserved, nine developed severe aortic regurgitation and two patients developed dilation of the aortic root requiring subsequent replacement during the follow-up period. Aortic regurgitation at presentation was not found to be associated with subsequent risk of developing severe aortic regurgitation or reintervention on the aortic valve. Overall mortality was observed to be significantly lower in patients undergoing AAG (17.5% vs. 41.5%, p = .004). With careful patient selection, the native aortic root shows good long-term durability both in terms of valve competence and stable root dimensions after surgery for ATAAD. This study supports the consideration of conservation of the aortic valve during emergency surgery for type-A dissection, in the absence of a definitive indication for root replacement, including in cases where aortic regurgitation complicates the presentation."

    "abstract": "Type A aortic dissection (TAAD) involves a tear in the intimal layer of the thoracic aorta proximal to the left subclavian artery, and hence, carries a high risk of mortality and morbidity and requires urgent intervention. This dissection can extend into the main coronary arteries. Coronary artery involvement in TAAD can either be due to retrograde extension of the dissection flap into the coronaries or compression and/or blockage of these vessels by the dissection flap, possibly causing myocardial ischemia. Due to the emergent nature of TAAD, coronary involvement is often missed during diagnosis, thereby delaying the required intervention. The main scope of this review is to summarize the literature on the incidence, mechanism, diagnosis, and treatment of coronary artery involvement in TAAD. A comprehensive literature search was performed using multiple electronic databases, including PubMed, Ovid, Scopus and Embase, to identify and extract relevant studies. Incidence of coronary artery involvement in TAAD was seldom reported in the literature, however, some studies have described patients diagnosed either preoperatively, intraoperatively following aortic clamping, or even during autopsy. Among the few studies that reported on this matter, the treatment choice for coronary involvement in TAAD was varied, with the majority revascularizing the coronary arteries using coronary artery bypass grafting or direct local repair of the vessels. It is well-established that coronary artery involvement in TAAD adds to the already high mortality and morbidity associated with this disease. Lastly, the right main coronary artery was often more implicated than the left. This review reiterates the significance of an accurate diagnosis and timely and effective interventions to improve prognosis. Finally, further large cohort studies and longer trials are needed to reach a definitive consensus on the best approach for coronary involvement in TAAD."

Our study aims to leverage a nationally representative database to assess contemporary in-hospital outcomes in surgical repair of ATAAD, as well as the association of age and sex with outcomes. The National Inpatient Sample was queried to identify hospital discharge records of patients aged ≥18 years who underwent urgent surgical repair of ATAAD between 2017 and 2018. Patients with a diagnosis of thoracic aortic dissection, who underwent surgical intervention of the ascending aorta, were identified. Patient demographics were assessed, and predictors of in-hospital mortality were identified. We identified 7805 weighted cases of surgically repaired ATAAD nationally, with an overall mortality of 15.3%. Mean age was 60.0 ± 13.6 years. There was a male predominance, although female subjects made up a larger proportion of older age groups-female subjects up 18.4% of patients younger than 40 years with ATAAD but 53.6% of patients older than 80 years. In multivariable analysis controlling for sex, race, comorbidities, and malperfusion, age was a significant predictor of mortality. Patients aged 71 to 80 years had a 5.3-fold increased risk of mortality compared with patients ≤40 years old (P < .001), and patients aged >80 years had a 6.8-fold increased risk of mortality (P < .001). Sex was not significantly associated with mortality. Surgical repair of ATAAD continues to carry high risk of morbidity and mortality, with outcomes impacted significantly by patient age, regardless of patient comorbidity burden."

Fibrinogen concentrate has been increasingly used to treat coagulopathic bleeding in cardiac surgery, although its effectiveness and safety are unknown. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of fibrinogen concentrate in patients with acute type A aortic dissection. From July 2020 to August 2021, 84 patients with acute type A aortic dissection who underwent emergency aortic arch surgery involving MHCA and whose intraoperative fibrinogen level was less than 1.5 g/L were included in this study. Fifty-four patients who were supplemented with fibrinogen concentrate were included in the FC treatment group. Thirty patients were included in the non-FC treatment group. The primary endpoints included the required volumes of individual allogeneic blood products (RBCs, FFP, and PC), volumes of cumulative drainage within 24 and 48 h, and total volumes after infusion of FC, as well as reoperation rates due to bleeding. The secondary endpoint for the study was the incidence of serious adverse events from the infusion of FC to day 45. The serious adverse events defined for the evaluation of the safety of FC were death, pulmonary embolism and other thromboembolic or ischaemic events. The clinical data, routine laboratory tests and plasma fibrinogen levels were obtained at 5 time points. We observed rapid increases in the plasma fibrinogen level and subsequent improvement in haemostasis after the administration of fibrinogen concentrate. The mean fibrinogen level increased from 1.36 ± 0.75 g/L to 2.91 ± 0.76 g/L in the fibrinogen concentrate treatment group. The patients in the fibrinogen concentrate treatment group demonstrated lower volumes of cumulative postoperative drainage and transfused allogeneic blood products than the nonfibrinogen concentrate treatment group. There were no serious adverse events in the fibrinogen concentrate treatment group during hospitalization. Fibrinogen concentrate was effective at increasing the plasma fibrinogen level and significantly reduced the volumes of transfused allogeneic blood products and blood loss in patients with aortic arch surgery. There were no serious adverse events in the patients who received fibrinogen concentrate treatment. The safety and efficacy of fibrinogen concentrate were investigated in acute type A aortic dissection patients with aortic arch surgery. Fibrinogen concentrate was effective at increasing the plasma fibrinogen level and significantly reduced the volumes of transfused allogeneic blood products and blood loss; there were no serious adverse events in the patients who received fibrinogen concentrate treatment."

Therefore, rapid identification and treatment are critical for clinical outcomes. We report the urgent treatment of a complicated subacute aortic dissection treated with a physician-modified-endograft (PMEG) fenestrated-TEVAR (f-TEVAR) for the left common carotid artery (LCCA). A 49-year-old male patient with acute non-A non-B aortic dissection with complete true lumen collapse and associated mesenteric and renal ischemia, was referred to another vascular center for abdominal pain and received exclusively medical treatment. After 15 days of persistent pain, the patient self-referred to our center and was treated with endovascular repair. The proximal entry tear was located at the level of the left subclavian artery: a PMEG f-TEVAR was performed with fenestration for LCCA in conjunction with carotid-subclavian bypass. In addition, spot stenting of the left renal artery was performed to resolve renal malperfusion. The final angiography showed satisfactory result. The patient soon reported significant pain relief. Follow-up at 30-days was satisfactory, with no need for further intervention. A physician-modified fenestrated-TEVAR can be used in emergency setting to treat acute non-A-non-B aortic dissection in conjunction with multiorgan malperfusion, with satisfactory results even after initial delayed treatment."

    "abstract": "Type A aortic dissection is a cardiovascular emergency. Its incidence seems to have increased in the last few years; it is not clear whether this is a consequence of the ageing population or better awareness of the diagnosis (Erbel R, Alfonso F, Boileau C, Dirsch O, Eber B, Haverich A et al.; Task Force on Aortic Dissection, European Society of Cardiology. Diagnosis and management of aortic dissection Task Force on Aortic Dissection, European Society of Cardiology. Eur Heart J 2001;15;22:1642-81). Acute type A aortic dissection is often lethal without urgent surgical treatment with mortality rates of around 17% (Conzelmann LO, Weigang E, Mehlhorn U, Abugameh A, Hoffmann I, Blettner M et al. Mortality in patients with acute aortic dissection type A: analysis of pre- and intraoperative risk factors from the German Registry for Acute Aortic Dissection Type A (GERAADA). Eur J Cardiothorac Surg 2016;49:e44-e52). Pheochromocytomas are rare tumours, though often asymptomatic, they could be lethal if left untreated. The incidence is around 0.6 per 100,000 persons per year. The association of both aortic dissection and pheochromocytoma is rare. Here, we report a case of a 36-year-old patient with pheochromocytoma and hypertension, whose delay of surgery due to the Covid-19 pandemic led to acute type A aortic dissection."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a high mortality disease that can lead to acute ischemic strokes (AIS). Some of the patients with AAD combined with AIS initially present with neurological symptoms, which can easily lead to missed or delayed AAD diagnosis. This is attributed to the lack of physician awareness or the urgency of patient thrombolysis. Intravenous administration of thrombolytic therapy (IVT) for AAD is associated with poor prognostic outcomes. We report a patient with AIS combined with AAD who developed a massive cerebral infarction after receiving IVT for a missed AAD diagnosis. A 49-year-old man was admitted to a local hospital with an acute onset of left-sided limb weakness accompanied by slurred speech. The patient had a history of hypertension that was not regularly treated with medication. Physical examination revealed incomplete mixed aphasia and left limb hemiparesis. Cranial computed tomography (CT) scan showed bilateral basal ganglia and lateral ventricular paraventricular infarct lesions. The patient was diagnosed with AIS and was administered with IVT. After IVT, patient's muscle strength and consciousness deteriorated. From the local hospital, he was referred to our hospital for further treatment. Emergency head and neck CT angiography (CTA) scans were performed. Results showed multiple cerebral infarctions, and aortic dissection in the ascending aorta, innominate artery, as well as in the right common carotid artery. Then, the CTA of thoracoabdominal aorta was performed, which revealed a Stanford type A aortic dissection and aortic dissection extending from the aortic root to the left external iliac artery. Laceration was located in the lesser curvature of the aortic arch. AAD complicated with AIS was considered, and the patient was immediately subjected to cardiovascular surgery for treatment. The next day, the patient underwent aortic arch and ascending aortic replacement and aortic valvuloplasty. Clinical manifestations for AAD combined with AIS are diverse. Some patients may not exhibit typical chest or back pains. Therefore, patients should be carefully evaluated to exclude AAD before administering IVT in order to avoid adverse consequences."

TEVAR is widely accepted as a less invasive treatment than conventional surgery, and is usually recognized as the first-line treatment, especially for complicated type B. On the other hand, there is still little clear evidence for TEVAR for uncomplicated type B without rupture or malperfusion, and careful selection of cases is considered necessary. In this review article, we describe the acute treatment of Stanford type B acute aortic dissection with reference to recent guidelines and literature."

Patients with connective tissue disorders (CTD) are younger and require safe, efficient treatment with long-term durability. This study provides current outcome data to help inform treatment decisions. All OSRs of descending thoracic aortic aneurysm (DTAA) or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) from January 2011 to July 2021 were included in a retrospective cohort study. Primary outcome measures were early and follow-up mortality and reintervention. Secondary outcome measures were major complications. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate reintervention-free survival. A total of 26 OSRs (7 DTAA, 19 TAAA) were performed in 23 patients: 20 (77%) Marfan and 6 (23%) Loeys-Dietz syndrome; median age 43 years. Aortic dissection was present in 100% and 3/26 (12%) were urgent. Early mortality was 1/26 (3.8%). No patient suffered spinal cord ischemia, stroke, vocal cord paralysis, or re-exploration for bleeding. The transient respiratory failure occurred in 19% (5/26) and transient renal replacement therapy in 15% (4/26). Renal function normalized in all patients within 3 months. During follow-up (median 4.6, range 0-11 years) there were no deaths and only one re-intervention on a previously operated aortic segment, resulting in 92% reintervention-free survival at 5 years. In dedicated units, open surgical DTAA and TAAA repair in patients with CTD can be performed with a very low risk of death, severe complications and, late re-intervention. For CTD patients with reasonable risk, OSR should remain the first line of treatment."

Here, we decided to evaluate the outcome of supra coronary aortic repair technique in patients with type A acute aortic dissection for 16 years in Isfahan Chamran hospital that one surgeon performed. This is a retrospective descriptive cross-sectional study performed in 2019 in Isfahan on documents of 54 patients who underwent supra-coronary repair surgery for type A aortic dissection during 2004 to 2019. We collected patient's demographic information, the condition of patient's vital signs at the time of admission to the hospital and before surgery, the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time and other variables. We also collected data regarding patient's mortality and possible surgical complications. Evaluation of surgical complications showed that acute renal failure (ARF) was the most common complication (87%) followed by postoperative bleeding in ICU that required surgical operation (18.5%), neurologic complications (13%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (9.3%) and chronic renal failure (CRF) (1.9%). The mortality rate was 14.8% (8 patients). The most frequent reason for mortality was bleeding (50%), major neurologic complications (37.5%), multiple organ failure (25%), cardiac failure (12.5%) and CRF (12.5%). Patients with mortality had significantly higher age compared to other patients (P = 0.03), significantly higher duration of CPB use (P = 0.03), higher frequency of irregular peripheral pulses (P = 0.01), higher frequency of abnormal carotid pulses (P = 0.04), and higher bleeding volume in the ICU (P = 0.04). Age, disturbed preoperative clinical condition, postoperative bleeding, and organ failure could increase the rates of mortality of AADA."

Retrospective analysis of a cohort of patients included in the France-TAVI registry who had undergone TAVR with the latest generation valves between January 2017 and February 2020. Among the 968 patients undergoing TAVR, 6 patients (0.62%) were identified as candidates for surgery: 3 in the peri-operative context and 3 during hospitalization. Four subjects were managed in a salvage situation, two due to tamponade, one due to aortic dissection, and one due to aortic annulus rupture. One patient died of a delayed aortic annulus rupture and one patient presented a right coronary occlusion which was medically treated. All patients who underwent emergency surgery were discharged alive from the hospital. In TAVR patients initially contraindicated for surgery, emergency bailout surgery could be performed successfully with all patients discharged alive. Access to on-site heart surgery represents a life-saving resource for TAVR centers."

Using a national vascular surgery database, we evaluated the associations between preoperative anemia and 30-day mortality, postoperative complications, and 1-year survival for patients undergoing TEVAR. We retrospectively analyzed all patients in the Vascular Quality Initiative who had undergone TEVAR for aortic dissection, aortic aneurysm, penetrating aortic ulcer, hematoma, or thrombus between January 2011 and December 2019. We excluded patients with a ruptured aneurysm, traumatic dissection, emergent repair, treated aorta distal to zone 5, polycythemia, transfusion of >4 U of packed red blood cells intraoperatively or postoperatively, and missing data on hemoglobin level or surgical indications. The final study cohort was dichotomized into two groups: normal/mild anemia (women, ≥10 g/dL; men, ≥12 g/dL) and moderate/severe anemia (women, <10 g/dL; male, <12 g/dL). Propensity scores by stratification were used to control for confounding in the analysis of the association between the outcomes of 30-day mortality, postoperative complications, and 1-year survival and a binary indicator variable of moderate/severe anemia vs normal/mild anemia. Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank tests were used to compare the 1-year survival between the two groups. A Cox regression model was fitted to assess the associations between anemia and survival outcomes. A total of 3391 patients were analyzed, 958 (28.3%) of whom had had moderate/severe anemia. After adjustment for multiple clinical factors using propensity score stratification, moderate/severe anemia was associated with a 141% increased odds of 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-5.05; P = .019), 58% increased odds of any in-hospital complication (aOR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.17-2.13; P = .003), 281% increased odds of intraoperative transfusion (aOR, 3.81; 95% CI, 2.68-5.53; P < .001). In addition, moderate/severe anemia was associated with significantly worse survival within the first year after TEVAR (log-rank P < .001; 1-year survival rate using Kaplan-Meier estimates, 86.4% ± 1.3% standard error vs 92.5% ± 0.6% standard error) and with an increased risk of mortality in the first postoperative year (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.16-2.82; P = .009). We found that moderate or severe anemia is associated with significantly increased odds of mortality, postoperative complications, and worse 1-year survival after TEVAR. Future studies are needed to evaluate the effect of anemia correction on the outcomes of TEVAR."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a life-threatening medical condition requiring urgent surgical attention. It is estimated that 50% of ATAAD die within 24 h of onset, with the mortality rate is increasing by 1%-2% every additional hour without prompt intervention. A variety of ATAAD surgical repair techniques exist which has sparked controversy within the literature, with the main two strategies being proximal aortic replacement (PAR) and total arch replacement (TAR). Nevertheless, the question of which of these two strategies if the more optimal is still debatable. This commentary aims to discuss the recent study by Sa and colleagues which presents a pooled analysis of Kaplan-Meier-derived individual patient data from studies with follow-up comparing aggressive (TAR) and conservative (PAR) approaches to manage ATAAD patients. A comprehensive literature search was performed using multiple electronic databases including PubMed, Ovid, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and Scopus to collate the relevant research evidence. The more aggressive TAR approach for treating ATAAD seems to yield more favorable results including more optimal long-term survival as well as a lower need for reoperation. The frozen elephant trunk (FET) technique can be considered the mainstay TAR technique. It is valid to conclude that TAR with FET is the superior strategy for managing ATAAD patients."

All patients with symptomatic IMAD referred to the ISC from January 2016 to January 2020 were included prospectively. Patients with aortic dissection and asymptomatic IMAD were not included. The standardised medical protocol included anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy, gastrointestinal resting, and oral antibiotics. Operations were considered for acute mesenteric ischaemia (AMI). Among the 453 patients admitted to an ISC during the study period, 34 (median age, 53 years [41 - 67]; 82% men) with acute symptomatic IMAD were included. According to the classification of Yun et al., IMADs were reported as follows: type I (n = 7, 20%), type IIa (n = 6, 18%), type IIb (n = 15, 44%), and type III (i.e., complete superior mesenteric artery [SMA] occlusion; n = 6, 18%). Overall, nine (26%) patients had AMI (type I/II, n = 3; type III, n = 6). On initial computerised tomography angiogram, nine (26%) patients had an associated visceral arterial dissection or pseudoaneurysm. All patients with types I/II (n = 28, 82%) followed a favourable clinical course with conservative therapy, with no need for any operation. All patients with type III (n = 6, 18%) underwent urgent laparotomy with SMA revascularisation (open, n = 4; stenting, n = 1) and or bowel resection (early, n = 3; late, n = 1). Rates of intestinal resection and short bowel syndrome were 12% and 8.8%, respectively. After a median follow up of 26 months [18 - 42], recurrence of symptoms occurred in four (12%) patients and aneurysmal change in 14 (41%), with no re-intervention. Although IMAD was associated with a high frequency of AMI, a standardised protocol produced a low rate of intestinal resection. Conservative therapy seems appropriate in types I/II patients, whereas urgent SMA revascularisation should aim to avoid intestinal resection or death in type III patients."

This study aimed to explore the prognostic value of LVH in predicting postoperative outcomes in acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) patients. This was a single-central retrospectively designed study. One hundred and ninety-three ATAAD patients who underwent surgical repair at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 2018 to November 2021 were enrolled. Patients were divided based on their left ventricular mass index (LVMI). We compared their baseline characteristics, perioperative data, and in-hospital outcome. Then nomogram models were developed based on logistic regression to predict the postoperative outcomes. LVH presented in 28.5% (55 in 193) patients. LVH group had a higher proportion of female patients compared with the non-LVH group (32.7% vs. 17.4%, P=0.03). Decreased left ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac tamponade were more prevalent in patients with LVH. LVH group had a higher risk of postoperative composite major outcomes (CMO) and operative mortality. Based on multivariable logistic regression, LVH/LVMI, Penn classification, hyperlipidemia, emergency surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass duration were applied to develop nomogram models for predicting postoperative CMO. The area under curve was 0.825 (95% CI: 0.749-0.900) for Model LVH and 0.841 (95% CI: 0.776-0.905) for Model LVMI. Nomogram models for predicting postoperative cardiac were developed based on LVH/LVMI and cardiopulmonary bypass duration. The area under curves for the models involving LVH or LVMI were 0.782 (95% CI: 0.640-0.923) and 0.795 (95% CI: 0.643-0.947), respectively. LVH and increased LVMI was associated with increased risk of postoperative CMO and cardiac events in ATAAD patients. The nomogram models based on LVH or LVMI might help predict postoperative CMO. Future research would be necessary to investigate prognostic value of LVH for long-term outcomes in ATAAD patients."

After 8 days without recovering consciousness, the man died. Antemortem contrast-enhanced computed tomography at the emergency department indicated Stanford type B/DeBakey type IIIb aortic dissection. The autopsy showed a sharp and transverse intimal tear 0.6 cm in length in the aortic isthmus and fractures in the 5th-6th thoracic vertebrae. No structural abnormalities in arterial walls were noted on histopathological examination. The traumatic aortic dissection induced by falling is rare, compared with vehicle crash. Although the verification process was challenging, the cause of death was ultimately concluded as traumatic aortic dissection due to falling into the refuse pit. The following observations were cited as evidence: (1) the location and feature of the intimal tear, (2) the positional relationship between the impact site and the entry tear, and (3) the circumstance of clash impact onto the \"cushion\" of accumulated waste in the refuse pit. Inquiries into the cause of death, such as those made in this report, are required to provide detailed information on the circumstances of the accident, postmortem examinations, and careful consideration."

    "abstract": "Acute Type A Aortic Dissection (ATAAD) is a cardiothoracic emergency that requires urgent intervention. Elderly status, particularly age over 80, is an independent risk factor for mortality and morbidity. The mid-term outcomes of this age group are also unknown. This systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies was therefore performed to analyse short- and mid-term mortality and morbidity in octogenarians following surgery for ATAAD. A systematic review was conducted for studies published since January 2000. The primary endpoint was short-term mortality, either reported as 30-day mortality or in-hospital mortality and medium-term (five year) survival. Secondary endpoints were rates of postoperative complications, namely stroke, acute renal failure (ARF), re-exploration and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS). A total of 16 retrospective studies, with a total of 16, 641 patients were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Pooled analysis demonstrated that octogenarian cohorts are at significantly higher risk of short-term mortality than non-octogenarians (OR 1.93; 95% CI 1.33-2.81; P < 0.001). Actuarial survival was significantly lower in the octogenarian cohort, with a five-year survival in the octogenarian cohort of 54% compared to 76% in the non-octogenarian cohort (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the cohorts in terms of secondary outcomes: stroke, ARF, re-exploration or ICU LOS. Octogenarians are twice as likely to die in the short-term following surgery for ATAAD and demonstrate a significantly lower five-year actuarial survival. Patients and family members should be well informed of the risks of surgery and suitable octogenarians selected for surgery."

The patient's clinical findings, complications, and patient's history are closely related to mortality rates. Cardiac surgery score (CASUS) is a scoring system which is calculated by considering the special pathophysiological conditions of patients undergoing cardiac surgery and predicts post-operative results with high accuracy. Following the ethical approval from institutional ethics committee (ID: 2021/7/496), the data of consecutive 50 ATAAD patients who underwent emergent surgery in our hospital between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020, were evaluated. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and CASUS scores were calculated using the worst values of the daily laboratory and neurological status for both in admission to emergency department and during intensive care unit (ICU) follow-up period. The average and the total values of these scores were recorded for pre-operative, post-operative 1st day, and for the categorical data were defined as frequency and percentage. We used the Mann-Whitney U test for the independent continuous data comparisons and Pearson Chi-Square or Fisher exact test for categorical data comparison whole ICU period. Continuous data were presented as median and interquartile ranges (25-75th). The study comprised 50 patients, the rate of death was 34% (n=17). In total group, there were hypertension 72% (n=36), diabetes mellitus 24% (n=12), initial hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL (10.7-14.1, 25-75th), creatinine 1.09 mg/dL (0.85-1.33, 25-75th), and 72% (n=36) of these patients were male. The CASUSmean and SOFAmean scores were higher in the death-group when compared with the group who survived (12.9 [9.5-13.8, 25-75th], 3 [2-5, 25-75th]; 8 [6.1-9.2, 25-75th], 2.6 (2-4.5, 25-75th], p<0.001, respectively]. CASUSmean was independently associated with the 1-month mortality in model 1 (HR 1.25 [1.14-1.37] (p<0.001). According to our results increase in CASUS mean was the main predictor of 1 month mortality. When CASUS mean exceeds 8.3 the patient should be followed up more carefully for major adverse events including death."

    "abstract": "Actinomycosis is a chronic invasive infection caused by Actinomyces species. Actinomycosis endocarditis has been described, yet considered rare. We present the first reported transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)-related actinomycosis endocarditis. A 70-year-old female patient, presented 4 months after TAVI with malaise and vocal-cord paralysis. She underwent computed tomography angiography which demonstrated a 28 mm pseudoaneurysm of the ascending aorta, which compressed the laryngeal nerves. Her condition rapidly deteriorated with cardiogenic shock and required an emergent surgery, which reviled a tamponade with active bleeding, due to an ascending aortic dissection. She underwent aortic valve and ascending aorta replacement. A 2 cm vegetation was found on the TAVI prosthetic valve and sent for cultures, which later revealed an Actinomyces neuii infection. Long-term intravenous ampicillin treatment was given. This case describes a patient with endocarditis on TAVI prosthetic valve, with an unusual clinical presentation and rapid deterioration to an emergency intervention. This unique presentation of tumour-like tissue invasion is characteristic of actinomycosis, and should be suspected especially following valve replacement."

    "abstract": "To report our experience applying endovascular stent graft repair to treat ascending aortic diseases in high-risk patients and to evaluate the safety and feasibility of this approach. Patients with comorbid conditions or older age are not suitable for open procedures but may be considered suitable for ascending endovascular repair. Eleven high-risk patients received zone 0 thoracic endovascular aortic repair from September 2014 to May 2020. All patients were followed up until death or December 2021. Primary outcomes were in-hospital and long-term all-cause mortality as well as in-hospital and long-term aorta-related mortality. The mean follow-up duration of all patients was 35.78 months. The cohort comprised of three pathology subgroups: penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer (PAU) (n =6), acute dissection (AD) (n = 3), and chronic dissecting aneurysm (CDA) (n = 2). The in-hospital all-cause mortality rates were 0%, 33.33% and 0% for PAU, AD, and CDA groups, respectively. Long-term all-cause mortality were 33.33%, 33.33%, and 50% for PAU, AD, and CDA groups, respectively. There was only one in-hospital death related to acute aortic dissection, and no long-term aorta-related deaths occurred during the study period. During the follow-up time, the majority of patients had good remodeling of ascending aorta, slow progression in cases with endoleak, and no aorta-related mortality. Ascending endovascular aortic repair appears to be a safe and feasible procedure for emergent aortic repair in carefully selected patients with prohibitive surgical risk who are not candidates for open procedures."

    "abstract": "Iatrogenic aortocoronary dissection (IACD) occurs mainly during procedures involving the right coronary artery (RCA) and can result in disabilities, the need for urgent complex surgery, and even death. The risk factors for IACD are ill characterized, and the best management strategy is questionable; thus, there is a need to evaluate the characteristics, treatment options, and outcomes of patients with IACD of the RCA. We searched medical databases for publications on IACD of the RCA to present the characteristics of the procedures, management, and outcomes. We report 142 cases of IACD of the RCA, reported between 1973 and 2021. The mean age of the patients was 63.0 years, 81 (57%) were men, 75 (52.8%) presented with stable angina, and 29 (20.4%) had chronic total occlusion of the RCA. The most used catheter shapes were Judkins right (42%) and Amplatz left (25%), and most (56%) catheters were used during percutaneous coronary interventions. Guiding catheters were used in 38% (19/50) of diagnostic procedures when IACD occurred. A catheter size of ≤5F was used in only 3 cases. The catheter size was 6F in 22% of the cases, >6F in 23%, and not reported in 52%. A high-grade dissection (Dunning class III) occurred in 54% (77/142) of the cases. Stenting of the RCA ostium was performed in 88 (62%) of the cases, conservative treatment in 25 (18%), and surgery in 40 (28%) (aortic root repair [5%], coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic root repair [11%], and coronary artery bypass grafting alone [10%]). The mortality rate was 6.5% (5/77) among patients with class III dissection. Each patient should be considered independently. The most frequent intervention was to seal the dissection with a stent in the ostial RCA. However, in select cases published in the literature, a conservative approach was a feasible and successful option."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess potential predictors of aortic events after an emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection, especially paying attention to the findings of computed tomography (CT) performed immediately after the surgery. Between January 2001 and December 2015, 72 patients, who were diagnosed as having Stanford type A acute aortic dissection with a patent false lumen in the descending thoracic aorta, survived the emergency operation, and had postoperative CT scan data, were included in this study (mean follow-up, 8.2 ± 3.8 years; range 0.8-17.4 years). From the CT scan data, the diameter of the false lumen (FL-D) and true lumen (TL-D) were measured, and the FL-D:TL-D ratio was calculated. Long-term outcomes of the FL-D > TL-D group (n = 30) and the FL-D < TL-D group (n = 42) were compared. In the late follow-up, 17 aortic events in the downstream aorta were observed. The FL-D:TL-D ratio (P = .01) was an adjusted risk of aortic events in multivariable analysis. The rates of freedom from aortic events at 5 and 9 years were superior in the FL-D < TL-D group than in the FL-D > TL-D group (92.0% and 88.6% vs 81% and 60.7%; log rank P < .05). Our results suggest that the false lumen:true lumen ratio predicts long-term prognosis after surgical repair of acute type A aortic dissection."

From October 2016 to April 2019, 129 patients underwent emergency operation for ATAAD in our institution, including 21 patients (16.3%, coronary angiography group) who received preoperative coronary angiography without knowledge of the ATAAD, and the rest 108 did not (Non-coronary angiography group). Preoperative clinical characteristics, 30-day mortality and postoperative complications were compared. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to confirm the independent prognostic factors for short-term and long-term outcomes. Patients undergoing coronary angiography had higher prevalence of preoperative hypotension or shock (61.9% vs 35.2%, P = 0.022), ischemic changes on electrocardiogram (66.7% vs 37.0%, P = 0.012), platelet inhibition (ADP-induced inhibition 92.0% vs 46.0%, P = 0.001), and coronary involvement (66.7% vs 30.6%, P = 0.002). 30-day mortality was 4.8% versus 9.3% (P = 0.84). Coronary angiography group had more intraoperative bleeding (1900 ml vs 1500 ml, P = 0.013) and chest-tube drainage on the first postoperative day (1040 ml vs 595 ml, P = 0.028). However, preoperative coronary angiography was not independent risk factors for 30-day mortality (OR 0.171, 95%CI 0.013-2.174, P = 0.173) and overall survival (HR 0.407; 95%CI 0.080-2.057; P = 0.277). Patients undergoing coronary angiography carried a higher risk of preoperative hemodynamic instability, myocardial ischemia, and perioperative bleeding. However, unintentional coronary angiography did not have a significant impact on short-term and long-term outcomes of emergency surgery in ATAAD."

The retrospective MURUSSIAS registry included spontaneous infrarenal acute aortic dissection (IAAS) managed with the unibody stent-graft system (AFX endovascular AAA system; Endologix Inc., Irvine, California) outside the current instruction for use. IAAS considered aortic dissection (AD), intramural hematoma (IMH), and penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU). Indications to IAAS treatment were symptoms, associated dilated abdominal aorta (>3 cm), rapidly-growing (>0.5 cm/6 months) aorta, IAAS disease progression. Measured results were technical success, early (within 30 days) and midterm outcomes (after 30 days), including mortality, complications, symptoms recurrence, type I/III endoleak occurrence, stent-graft patency, survival, and freedom from reintervention. The mean follow-up was 22.12 ± 17 months. The MURUSSIAS registry included 83 patients from 7 participating centers. IAAS indication to treatment were symptoms in 42 (51%). In 14 (17%) patients, the infrarenal aortic length was <80 mm, and in 28 (34%), the aortic bifurcation diameter was <16 mm. Technical success was 100%. Mortality occurred early in 1 (1%) and at the midterm in 3 (4%) patients. Complications occurred early in 10 (12%) patients (1 severe, 3 moderates, and 6 mild) and at midterm in 2 (2%) (2 moderate). No symptoms' recurrence or type I/III endoleaks were registered. The 36-month estimated survival and freedom from reinterventions were 89% and 92%, respectively. The MURUSSIAS registry is the largest collection of spontaneous IAAS managed endovascularly using the AFX endovascular AAA system. The IAAS peculiar anatomic features were fitted with the used technique with excellent results. This treatment strategy might be considered in IAAS unless specifically-designed endovascular solutions will be available also in the emergent setting. Further studies are required to assess the longer-term performances and the stability of the reported technique. The lack of specifically designed devices for infrarenal acute aortic syndrome (IAAS) disease remains an issue principally for its specific anatomic features. The MURUSSIAS registry retrospectively examined the outcomes of spontaneous IAAS treated using the unibody stent-graft system in a spontaneous national study; and reports the largest available data on this topic. The use of the unibody stent-graft system showed to fit the anatomic peculiarities of IAAS with excellent outcomes. This IAAS treatment strategy should be considered unless specifically designed endovascular solutions will be available."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a life-threatening cardiovascular emergency with high mortality, so identifying modifiable risk factors of AAD is of great public health significance. The associations of non-optimal temperature and temperature variability with AAD onset and the disease burden have not been fully understood. We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover study using a nationwide registry dataset from 1,868 hospitals in 313 Chinese cities. Conditional logistic regression and distributed lag models were used to investigate associations of temperature and temperature changes between neighboring days (TCN) with the hourly AAD onset and calculate the attributable fractions. We also evaluated the heterogeneity of the associations. A total of 40,270 eligible AAD cases were included. The exposure-response curves for temperature and TCN with AAD onset risk were both inverse and approximately linear. The risks were present on the concurrent hour (for temperature) or day (for TCN) and lasted for almost 1 day. The cumulative relative risks of AAD were 1.027 and 1.026 per 1°C lower temperature and temperature decline between neighboring days, respectively. The associations were significant during the non-heating period, but were not present during the heating period in cities with central heating. 23.13% of AAD cases nationwide were attributable to low temperature and 1.58% were attributable to temperature decline from the previous day. This is the largest nationwide study demonstrating robust associations of low temperature and temperature decline with AAD onset. We, for the first time, calculated the corresponding disease burden and further showed that central heating may be a modifier for temperature-related AAD risk and burden.

This was an observational study of aortic surgeries from 2010 to 2018. All patients with acute type A aortic dissection undergoing open aortic arch reconstruction were included. Patients were dichotomized by the presence or absence of malperfusion syndrome and were analyzed for differences in short-term postoperative outcomes, including morbidity and in-hospital mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival estimation and multivariable Cox analysis were performed to identify variables associated with survival. A total of 467 patients undergoing aortic arch reconstruction for acute type A aortic dissection were identified, of whom 332 (71.1%) presented without malperfusion syndrome and 135 (28.9%) presented with malperfusion syndrome. Patients with malperfusion syndrome had higher in-hospital mortality (21.5% vs 5.7%) than patients without malperfusion syndrome. After multivariable adjustment, malperfusion syndrome was associated with worse survival (hazard ratio, 2.43, 95% confidence interval, 1.61-3.66, P < .001) compared with patients without malperfusion syndrome. The predicted risk of mortality increased as the number of malperfused vascular beds increased. Patients with coronary malperfusion syndrome and neuro-malperfusion syndrome had reduced survival compared with the rest of the cohort (P < .05). Malperfusion syndrome is associated with higher in-hospital mortality and reduced survival for patients with acute type A aortic dissection, with the risk of mortality increasing as the number of malperfused vascular beds increases. Coronary malperfusion syndrome and neuro-malperfusion syndrome may represent a high-risk subgroup of patients presenting with acute type A aortic dissection complicated by malperfusion syndrome. Finally, malperfusion syndrome may benefit from immediate surgical intervention to restore true lumen perfusion, as opposed to operative delay."

    "abstract": "The ascending aorta is the most simple and rapid arterial access for the establishment of antegrade systemic perfusion. In acute type A aortic dissection, prompt establishment of antegrade central perfusion, especially in unstable hemodynamic emergency operations, help to diminish organ malperfusion and to prevent retrograde embolism. The effectiveness as well as the safety of antegrade perfusion under ultrasonographic guidance through the dissected ascending aorta was evaluated for the repair of type A aortic dissection utilizing a new echo stabilizer. Ascending aortic cannulation was successfully performed in 64 consecutive patients, using the Seldinger technique, with the hands-free continuous-echo monitoring, utilizing a new stabilizer. Epiaortic 2-Dimensional and color Doppler imaging provided real-time monitoring for the placement and proper perfusion of ascending aorta cannulation. Ascending aorta can routinely provide a rapid and reliable route of antegrade central systemic perfusion in type A acute aortic dissection. The echo-guided stabilizer-assisted cannulation method can safely provide a rapid and reliable route for antegrade central perfusion during in type A dissections repair."

This study aimed to investigate the correlation between NIRS-derived oxygen saturation and risk of postoperative stroke. Methods: This study included 193 patients with acute type A aortic dissection undergoing emergency surgery and elective unilateral cerebral perfusion via the right axillary artery at the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, Nanjing, China, from 2018 to 2020. NIRS was used for intraoperative cerebral oxygen saturation monitoring, and the basal values and the lowest values of cerebral oxygen saturation during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) were recorded. The patients were divided into no-stroke group (n=178, 92.2%) and stroke group (n=15, 7.8%) according to the absence or presence of postoperative stroke. The differences in preoperative, operative and postoperative clinical differences between the two groups were compared, and the relationship between the lowest cerebral oxygen saturation value and the change in cerebral oxygen saturation value ((base-lowest)/basal) and postoperative stroke were analyzed. Results: The proportion of preoperative atrial fibrillation (6.7% vs. 0.6%, P=0.026), and the proportion of preoperative hypotension (26.7% vs. 9.0%, P=0.031) were significantly higher in the stroke group than no-stroke group. There were no differences in the surgical approach between the two groups. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time ((256.1±84.8) h vs.(217.8±58.4) h, P=0.020), postoperative mechanical ventilation time ((139.3±172.8) h vs. (35.6±45.6) h, P<0.001) were significantly longer in stroke group as compared to no-stroke group. Incidence of postoperative tracheotomy (20.0% vs. 1.1%, P<0.001), acute kidney injury (73.3% vs. 30.3%, P=0.001) and continuous renal replacement therapy (46.7% vs. 11.8%, P<0.001) as well as mortality (20.0% vs. 5.1%, P=0.022) were significantly higher in the stroke group than in non-stroke group. There was no significant difference in the basal NIRS value and the lowest NIRS value during DHCA between the two groups. Patients in the stroke group had a significantly greater intraoperative change rate of right NIRS as compared to no-stroke group (15.2%±15.7% vs. 9.2%±7.0%, P=0.006). Conclusions: NIRS is valuable for monitoring cerebral oxygen saturation during acute type A aortic dissection surgery, and the rate change of NIRS during operation correlates significantly with postoperative stroke. 目的： 探讨近红外光谱（NIRS）脑氧饱和度监测与急性A型主动脉夹层患者术后脑卒中的相关性，为术中NIRS监测提供证据。 方法： 纳入2018—2020年在南京鼓楼医院心胸外科接受急诊手术治疗及经右腋动脉选择性单侧脑灌注的急性A型主动脉夹层的患者193例。NIRS用于术中脑灌注的监测，记录基础值和深低温停循环期间的最低值。根据术后有无卒中发生分为无卒中组（n=178，92.2%）和卒中组（n=15，7.8%）。对比分析两组患者术前、术中和术后临床差异，并分析最低NIRS值和NIRS变化值［（基础-最低）/基础］与术后卒中发生的关系。 结果： 与无卒中组相比，卒中组术前合并心房颤动（6.7%比0.6%，P=0.026）和低血压（26.7%比9.0%，P=0.031）发生比例更高。两组患者手术方式无差异，但卒中组手术中体外循环时间长于无卒中组［（256.1±84.8）h比（217.8±58.4）h，P=0.020］。卒中组术后机械通气时间［（139.3±172.8）h比（35.6±45.6）h，P<0.001］，气管切开（20.0%比1.1%，P<0.001）、急性肾损伤（73.3%比30.3%，P=0.001）和连续性肾替代治疗比例（46.7%比11.8%，P<0.001），以及死亡率（20.0%比5.1%，P=0.022）均高于非卒中组。两组患者术中左侧和右侧基础NIRS、深低温停循环期间最低NIRS值差异均无统计学意义，但卒中组右侧NIRS变化值大于无卒中组（15.2%±15.7%比9.2%±7.0%，P=0.006）。 结论： NIRS用于急性A型主动脉夹层术中深低温停循环期间的脑氧饱和度监测对控制脑氧供需平衡具有指导价值，相较于最低NIRS值，NIRS变化值与术后卒中更具有相关性。."

We retrospectively analyzed patients who were diagnosed with AD and admitted to our ED between September 1, 2017-August 31, 2020. Data on age, gender, clinical manifestation, medical history, routine blood tests, liver and kidney function, coagulation, myocardial enzymology, and mortality were collected. We enrolled 535 AD patients (422 men and 113 women) with a mean age of 54.7±14.1 years. Type A AD constituted 40% of the total number of AD cases, while type B AD constituted 60%. The proportion of those who were females, 10-92 years, with type A AD, and hypertension in the Chinese population was lower than that in the Western population (P <0.05 for all). Type A AD patients had a higher proportion of acute AD clinical manifestations than did patients with type B AD (P = 0.0084, P <0.05). The mortality rate of type A AD patients (10.75%) was higher than that of type B AD patients (1.87%) (P <0.0001) in the ED. Higher values of white blood cells, neutrophils, high-density lipoprotein, activated partial thromboplastin time, and D-dimer level with worsened hepatic and renal function were found in the deceased group, and multivariate logistic regression revealed that blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels (P = 0.0031, P <0.05) were significantly associated with death. In South China, patients with AD had a mean age of 54.7 years, with 78.88% prevalence in males and 66.92% hypertension rate. Type A AD accounted for 40% of all AD cases, and 10.70% of patients with type A AD died in the ED. Elevated BUN levels may be a risk predictor for death in patients with type A AD."

However, their natural history is characterized by their propensity to rupture, which is very serious and requires urgent treatment. An emergent giant hepatic aneurysm with an abdominal aortic dissection is less commonly reported. We report the complicated case of a giant hepatic aneurysm with an abdominal aortic dissection. A 66-year-old female presented with the complaint of sudden upper abdominal pain accompanied by vomiting. Physical examination showed that her blood pressure was 214/113 mmHg. Her other vital signs were stable. Computed tomography found a giant hepatic proper aneurysm and dissection of the lower segment of the abdominal aorta. Furthermore, angiography showed a HAA with the maximum diameter of approximately 56 mm originating from the proper hepatic artery and located approximately 15 mm from the involved bifurcation of the left and right hepatic arteries with no collateral circulation. Therefore, we decided to use a stent to isolate the abdominal aortic dissection first, and then performed open repair. After the operation, the patient recovered well without complications, and her 3-month follow-up checkup did not reveal any late complications. Open surgery is a proven method for treating giant hepatic aneurysms. If the patient's condition is complex, staged surgery is an option."

Herein, we compared the pre- and postoperative outcomes of acute type A aortic dissection surgery before and after implementing the RT-PCR screening for all patients. We compared the postoperative results of 105 patients who underwent acute type A aortic dissection emergency surgery from January 2019 to October 2020 (Group I) and 109 patients who underwent the surgery following RT-PCR screening from November 2020 to March 2022 (Group II). The average waiting time from arrival at the hospital to admission to the operating room was 36 and 81 min in Groups I and II, respectively. Ruptured cardiac tamponade was observed preoperatively in 26.6% and 21.1% of Groups I and II patients, respectively. The preoperative waiting time due to RT-PCR screening did not contribute to the cardiac tamponade. Surgical complications such as bleeding (reopened chest), respiratory failure, cerebral neuropathy, or mediastinitis did not increase significantly. The number of deaths 30 days after surgery (Group I = 13 and Group II = 3) showed no significant difference between the groups. There were no cases of nosocomial COVID-19 infections. Preoperative COVID-19 screening is an important method to prevent nosocomial infections.

We included patients with complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath and underwent cardiac ultrasound performed by emergency physician. Then, patients were evaluated by a cardiologist. The diagnoses made by the emergency physician were compared with the diagnoses made by the cardiologist. A total of 303 patients were included. The diagnoses made by the emergency medicine specialist and cardiologist as a result of the evaluation were recorded as 56.7% vs 52.10% for acute coronary syndrome, 29.70% vs 31.60% for congestive heart failure, 3.6% vs 3.30% for pulmonary embolism, 2.1% vs 2.10% for hypertensive pulmonary edema, 1.9% vs 2.10% for pericarditis, and 0.60% vs 1.30% for aortic dissection. It was determined that focused cardiac ultrasound performed by emergency physician was sufficient in terms of accuracy of findings and diagnosis, and played an important role in excluding or including fatal diagnoses and conditions. The success rates of emergency physician can be further increased with long-term and comprehensive training programs."

    "abstract": "Dyspnoea and chest pain are common causes of referral to emergency departments. Both symptoms are non-specific and may be caused by ST elevation myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, or infection. Fibrin D-dimer is often used for ruling out suspicion of acute diseases, but the clinical utility is limited by a modest specificity which lowers with age to approximately ten per cent at the age of 80 years. This review summarises the recommended approaches and highlights potential pitfalls when utilizing and interpreting fibrin D-dimer in the diagnostic work-up of commonly suspected medical conditions."

    "abstract": "Concomitant replacement of the aortic root and aortic valve is a widely used treatment strategy in elective patients with aortic valve stenosis and root aneurysm. It is also a strategy frequently employed in patients with acute aortic dissection type A (AADA), involving the aortic root. Although more patients have undergone valve sparing procedures over the past decades, the classic 'modified Bentall technique' remains a valid option, particularly for patients with a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). We aimed to compare the results of elective and emergency modified Bentall procedures in patients with bicuspid and tricuspid aortic valves (TAVs). We retrospectively reviewed our database for patients undergoing either elective or emergency modified Bentall procedures between 2000 and 2018 and identified 827 elective cases (44% BAV) and 258 emergency cases (15% BAV). Analysis of intra- and postoperative outcomes and early mortality was performed. Due to inequality of the groups, a matching analysis was performed. We found BAV patients to be significantly younger (elective: 58±18 vs. 65±14, P<0.001; emergency: 49±17 vs. 62±19, P<0.001) and healthier at time of surgery. In the AADA cohort, malperfusion rate was not different between bicuspid and tricuspid patients, however bicuspid AADA patients presented more often with an entry in the aortic root. After matching, procedure times and early outcomes did not differ between the groups, except for significantly higher rates of respiratory failure in elective TAV patients (10% vs. 5%, P=0.033). The 30-day mortality was 2% in elective cases and 22% in emergency AADA surgery. A subgroup analysis of elective patients with aortic diameter <55 mm also showed excellent outcomes. After adjustment for preoperative inequalities, no differences in early mortality and outcomes were found between bicuspid and tricuspid patients receiving elective or emergency modified Bentall surgery."

A 39-year-old woman with hypertension and Darier disease suffered an acute type A aortic dissection, requiring emergency operation with a Dacron graft. Twenty-five days post-operatively, she developed pneumonia and staph hominis was isolated in blood cultures and Bronchoalveolar Lavage. Following completion of antibiotics, multiple relapses occurred during a 6-month period, each time treated with appropriate antibiotic therapy. An 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography computerized tomography showed persistent graft uptake and re-operation was performed. At 22 months of follow-up, the patient remains asymptomatic and the 18F-FDG PET/CT shows significant reduction in FDG uptake. Graft infection is a rare but serious complication. Antibiotic therapy is often inadequate and re-operation is needed. As staphylococcal skin infections often occur in patients with Darier disease, adequate preprocedural skin preparation and sterilization are very important in these patients."

A 59-year-old man with TAAD had undergone TEVAR with in situ fenestration 4 months prior to presenting to our emergency room complaining of acute chest and back pain. Computed tomography angiography showed RTAD starting from the proximal endograft and extending to the aortic root. The patient was diagnosed with RTAD. We performed only the Bentall procedure, and the patient did not require total arch replacement. We removed the bare spring of the proximal endograft and anastomosed the prosthetic graft with the endograft and the native ascending aortic wall. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient remained asymptomatic for 3 years after surgery. Computed tomography angiography at the 3-year follow-up showed no perivalvular or anastomotic leakage. RTAD after TEVAR for TAAD was safely and effectively treated by anastomosing the prosthetic graft with the endograft and the native ascending aortic wall instead of total arch replacement."

A 54-year-old man with a history of hypertension presented to the emergency department with mild shortness of breath without chest pain.

WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Acute aortic dissection can present with a wide range of clinical manifestations with a high mortality rate for patients with an untimely diagnosis. Although an intimal flap within the aortic lumen is the characteristic finding on ultrasound, additional POCUS findings of a pericardial effusion, aortic regurgitation, and a dilated aortic root may be seen with proximal dissections. Diffuse B-lines on thoracic POCUS, although commonly associated with pulmonary edema in decompensated heart failure, can be seen in patients with DAH which has a multitude of etiologies, including aortic dissection."

Methods Medical records of 100 patients, who had undergone elective or emergency thoracic aorta reconstructive surgery at the Clinic for Cardiovascular Surgery, University Clinical Center Tuzla, were analysed. Intraoperative data as cross-clamp time (CCT), duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPBT) and hypothermic circulatory arrest time (HCAT) were evaluated. Univariate analysis was used to show risk factors for developing postoperative cardiac, respiratory, surgical and renal complications. Results Between May 2019 and April 2021, 48 Bentall procedures (BP), 23 ascending aortic replacements (AAR), 20 BP and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and 9 aortic valve replacements (AVR) with AAR were performed. Incidence of postoperative complications in the elective and emergency groups was as follows: respiratory 20% vs 38% (p=0.049), cardiac 18% vs 70% (p=0.015), renal 16% vs 48% (p=0.027) and surgical 4% vs 6% (p>0.05). Intrahospital 30 days morbidity was 44% with mortality rate of 13%. The results showed that CPBT>180 minutes was a risk factor for respiratory (p=0.034), cardiac (p=0.020) and renal (p=0.027) postoperative complications after acute type A aortic dissection surgery. Conclusion CPBT > 180 min is a risk factor for postoperative development of respiratory, cardiac and renal complications. Postoperative cardiac and renal complications were associated with longer HCAT."

A total of 1321 consecutive patients who were admitted to the emergency department of Fuwai Hospital from January 2016 to December 2020 were enrolled. Patients had computed tomography-confirmed ATAAD and were measured serum cTnI on admission. Patients were divided into the troponin-positive (cTnI > 0.02 ng/mL) or the troponin-negative group (cTnI ≤ 0.02 ng/mL). Troponin was detected by PATHFAST instrument produced by Medins Co., Ltd., and the reference range of normal value is 0-0.02 ng/mL.

Here, we report our findings regarding risk factors, short-term outcomes, and predicting model for massive bleeding in ATAAD patients who underwent emergent aortic repair. A universal definition of perioperative bleeding (UDPB) class 3 and 4 were used to define massive bleeding and comprehensively evaluate patients. A total of 402 consecutive patients were enrolled in this retrospective study during 2019. Surgical strategies used to perform aortic arch procedures included total arch and hemiarch replacements. In each criterion, patients with massive bleeding were compared with remaining patients. Multivariable regression analyses were used to identify independent risk factors for massive bleeding. Logistic regression was used to build the model, and the model was evaluated with its discrimination and calibration. Independent risk factors for massive bleeding included male sex (OR = 6.493, P < 0.001), elder patients (OR = 1.029, P = 0.05), low body mass index (BMI) (OR = 0.879, P = 0.003), emergent surgery (OR = 3.112, P = 0.016), prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time (OR = 1.012, P = 0.002), lower hemoglobin levels (OR = 0.976, P = 0.002), increased D-dimer levels (OR = 1.000, P = 0.037), increased fibrin degradation products (OR = 1.019, P = 0.008), hemiarch replacement (OR = 5.045, P = 0.037), total arch replacement (OR = 14.405, P = 0.004). The early-stage mortality was higher in massive bleeding group (15.9 vs. 3.9%, P = 0.001). The predicting model showed a well discrimination (AUC = 0.817) and calibration (χ2 = 5.281, P = 0.727 > 0.05). Massive bleeding in ATAAD patients who underwent emergent aortic repair is highly associated with gender, emergent surgery, increased D-dimer levels, longer CPB time, anemia, and use of a complex surgical strategy. Since massive bleeding may lead to worse outcomes, surgeons should choose suitable surgical strategies in patients who are at a high risk of massive bleeding."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Acute aortic syndrome (AAS) is a spectrum of severe life-threatening disease processes that are often initially encountered in the emergency department (ED) setting and require prompt recognition and treatment to prevent significant complications, including death. We describe an atypical presentation of aortic intramural hematoma in a female patient during sexual intercourse, a situation not previously described in the literature. CASE REPORT The patient was a 45-year-old woman who presented to the ED with a chief concern of chest pain. Just prior to the onset of her symptoms, the patient was having sexual intercourse with her husband, and during her orgasm she felt a \"pop\" in her chest with radiation to her back. The patient was diaphoretic and hypertensive on arrival, with a blood pressure of 220/140 mmHg. Computed tomography angiography of the chest was performed and showed an intramural hematoma (or thrombosed dissection) of the distal aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta. In the ED, the patient was started on intravenous antihypertensives, which were eventually switched to oral agents. Cardio-thoracic surgery staff was consulted and recommended medical management. As oral doses were increased, the intravenous antihypertensives were weaned, and the patient was eventually discharged home with scheduled outpatient follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Intramural aortic hematoma is a form of AAS with independent pathogenesis but similar progression, complications, and treatment as aortic dissection and thus demands efficient diagnosis and treatment. A high degree of suspicion, even in atypical situations, is paramount, as efficient recognition and treatment can be lifesaving."

The only urgent endovascular alternative to high-risk open surgery in the treatment of postdissection aneurysms is branched endovascular aortic repair (BEVAR), which is extremely difficult due to the intimal membrane in the aorta lumen and the compressed true lumen. In this case report, we present the first application of BEVAR for aortic dissection in Hungary. Our 76-year-old male patient underwent type B aortic dissection 13 years before, for which supraaortic debranching was followed by thoracic stent graft implantation. The patient was admitted with acute chest pain associated with a con-tained rupture of a ten centimetre dilatation of the thoracoabdominal aorta. Our aortic team recommended endo-vascular surgery due to the extremely high risk of open surgery, which the patient accepted. Following selective embolization of the proximal segment of the left subclavian artery, a complex aortic intervention was performed. A new thoracic stent graft was started from the in situ thoracic graft, followed by a branched thoracoabdominal graft, the four branches of which were connected to the celiac trunk, the superior mesenteric artery and the two renal arter-ies. We also implanted a bifurcation graft under the branched graft and a left iliac bifurcation graft due to the complex dissection of the left iliac artery system.

    "abstract": "The main challenge in diagnosing and managing thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAA/D) is represented by the early detection of a disease that is both deadly and \"elusive\", as it generally grows asymptomatically prior to rupture, leading to death in the majority of cases. Gender differences exist in aortic dissection in terms of incidence and treatment options. Efforts have been made to identify biomarkers that may help in early diagnosis and in detecting those patients at a higher risk of developing life-threatening complications. As soon as the hereditability of the TAA/D was demonstrated, several genetic factors were found to be associated with both the syndromic and non-syndromic forms of the disease, and they currently play a role in patient diagnosis/prognosis and management-guidance purposes. Likewise, circulating biomarker could represent a valuable resource in assisting the diagnosis, and several studies have attempted to identify specific molecules that may help with risk stratification outside the emergency department. Even if promising, those data lack specificity/sensitivity, and, in most cases, they need more testing before entering the \"clinical arena\". This review summarizes the state of the art of the laboratory in TAA/D diagnostics, with particular reference to the current and future role of molecular-genetic testing."

There is heterogeneity in the epidemiology and management of CVD between male and female patients. In the specific case of acute aortic dissection (AAD), women, at the time of diagnosis, are older than men and complain less frequently of an abrupt onset of pain with delayed presentation to the emergency department. Furthermore, a history of hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is more common among women. In type A AAD, women more often experience pleural effusion and coronary artery compromise, but experience less neurological and malperfusion symptoms. They undergo less frequent surgical treatment and have higher overall in-hospital mortality. Conversely, in type B AAD no significant differences were shown for in-hospital mortality between the two genders. However, it should be highlighted that further studies are needed in order to develop AAD gender specific preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."

Early diagnosis and treatment of non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is important because delayed treatment is associated with poor prognosis, especially in older adults. CASE REPORT An 82-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with epigastric and back pain. Despite the symptoms, the electrocardiogram revealed no abnormality, and the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (Hs-cTn) value was below the detection limit. Chest contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) performed to exclude fatal diseases such as aortic dissection revealed no obvious abnormalities. The patient's symptoms improved and she was discharged. On the following day, the radiologist reviewed the CT and noted reduced cardiac uptake of contrast medium, and so suspected a subendocardial infarction. The patient was immediately recalled to the ED. She had no symptoms, but her Hs-cTn level was markedly elevated and asynergy was found on echocardiography. Emergency coronary angiography revealed complete obstruction of the left anterior descending coronary artery. CONCLUSIONS Similar to patients with acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, those with unstable angina or NSTEMI should be treated early. Delayed diagnosis and treatment of acute coronary syndrome is associated with poor prognosis, especially in older adults. Therefore, in patients presenting to the ED with chest pain, careful attention should be paid to myocardial staining in addition to the aorta, pulmonary arteries, and abdominal organs, when performing contrast-enhanced CT."

Considering the risk of dissection rupture and SCD, an emergency surgery of aortic replacement and coronary anomaly correction was performed successfully for the patient. This report illustrated that AAORCA complicated with acute AD (AAD) is lethal and may promote the occurrence of coronary ischemia or sudden death by a new \"double-kill\" mechanism that myocardial ischemia was based on the extent of a fixed and a dynamic component like slit-like ostium, proximal narrowing, acute take-off angle and intramural course with the elliptic vessel shape.

As D-dimer testing has been reported to have high sensitivity to diagnose AAD in a clinical scale, Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score (ADD-RS), a point-of-care D-dimer analyzer capable of measuring in 10 min would be useful to deny AAD with concurrent STEMI. However, an optimal cut-off value of D-dimer in such population remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to elucidate the optimal D-dimer threshold in patients clinically diagnosed with STEMI. This retrospective cohort study was conducted at two tertiary care centers between 2014 and 2019. Patients clinically diagnosed with STEMI who underwent serum D-dimer measurement on hospital arrival were included. The primary outcome was the diagnosis of AAD. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for D-dimer values to diagnose AAD was evaluated, particularly in patients with low to moderate risks of AAD (1 of ADD-RS). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated with several cut-off values. A total of 322 patients were included, and 28 were diagnosed with AAD. The AUROC for D-dimer to diagnose AAD was 0.970 (95% confidence interval: 0.948-0.993) in 262 patients with 1 of ADD-RS. If D-dimer ≥750 ng/mL was used as a cut-off value, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were 100%, 86.4%, 37.7%, and 100%, respectively. AAD could be denied in 209 (79.8%) patients using the cut-off value (D-dimer <750 ng/mL). Serum D-dimer ≥750 ng/mL exhibited high sensitivity and NPV to diagnose AAD with concurrent STEMI, while the ADD-RS originally utilized ≥500 ng/mL as a cut-off for any suspected AAD.

Data of 159 patients with ATAAD who underwent emergency surgical treatment in our hospital from January 2019 to December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups according to whether human fibrinogen was administered before surgery: patients in group A received fibrinogen before surgery, while those in group B did not. The preoperative clinical data, surgical data, postoperative data, complications related to the coagulation function, and mortality of the two groups were compared and analyzed. The in-hospital mortality was similar in the two groups (2.9% vs. 9.3%, p = .122). However, group A had a significantly shorter operation time (279.24 ± 39.03 vs. 298.24 ± 45.90, p = .008), lower intraoperative blood loss (240.48 ± 96.75 vs. 353.70 ± 189.80, p < .001), and reduced intraoperative transfusion requirement of red blood cells (2.61 ± 1.18 vs. 6.05 ± 1.86, p < .001). The postoperative suction drainage within 24 h in group A was significantly decreased (243.24 ± 201.52 vs. 504.22 ± 341.08, p = .002). The incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) in group A was lower than that in group B (3.8% vs. 14.8%, p = .023). Similarly, the incidence of postoperative hepatic insufficiency in group A was lower than that in group B (1.9% vs. 9.3%, p = .045). In group A, the mechanical ventilation time was shorter (47.68 ± 28.61 vs. 118.21 ± 173.16, p = .004) along with reduced intensive care unit stay time (4.06 ± 1.18 vs. 8.09 ± 9.42, p = .003), and postoperative hospitalization days (19.20 ± 14.60 vs. 23.50 ± 7.56, p = .004). Preoperative administration of human fibrinogen in patients undergoing ATAAD surgery can effectively reduce the intraoperative blood loss, amount of blood transfused, operation time, and postoperative complications, and improve the early prognosis of patients.

It is also a treatment option for other disease states such as acute heart failure, pulmonary edema, and aortic dissection. Nitroglycerin is converted to nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator, in the body, leading to venodilation at lower dosages and arteriodilation at higher dosages that results in both preload and afterload reduction, respectively. Although nitroglycerin has historically been administered as a sublingual tablet and/or spray, it is often given intravenously in the emergency department as this enables titration to effect with predictable pharmacokinetics.

Previous studies had shown differences between invasive arterial BP monitoring (ABPM) and non-invasive cuff BP monitoring (CBPM), but not whether ABPM would result in patients' change of clinical management. We hypothesized that ABPM would change BP management in AoD patients. This was a prospective observational study of adult patients with AoD admitted to the Critical Care Resuscitation Unit from January 2019 to February 2021. Patients with AoD and both ABPM and CBPM measurements were included. Clinician's BP management goals were assessed in real time before and after arterial catheter placement according to current guidelines. We defined change of management as change of current antihypertensive infusion rate or adding a new agent. We used multivariable logistic and ordinal regressions to determine relevant predictors. We analyzed 117 patients, and 56 (47%) had type A dissection. ABPM was frequently ≥10 mmHg higher than CBPM values. Among 40 (34%) patients with changes in management, 58% (23/40) had [ABPM-CBPM] differences ≥20 mmHg. ABPM prompted increasing current antihypertensive infusion in 68% (27/40) of patients. Peripheral artery disease (OR 13, 95% CI 1.18-50+) was associated with changes in clinical management, and ordinal regression showed hypertension and serum lactate to be associated with differences between ABPM and CBPM. ABPM was frequently higher than CBPM, resulting in 34% of changes of management, most commonly increasing anti-hypertensive infusion rates."

    "abstract": "Older age and female sex are thought to be risk factors for adverse outcomes after repair of acute type A aortic dissection (AAAD). The aim of this study is to analyze age- and sex-related outcomes in patients undergoing AAAD repair. Retrospective analysis of patients undergoing emergency AAAD repair. Patients were divided in Group A, patients aged ≥75 years and Group B <75. Intraoperative and postoperative data were compared between groups before and after propensity score matching. Sex differences were analyzed by age group. Between January 2006 and December 2018, 638 patients underwent emergency AAAD repair. Group A included 143 patients (22.4%), Group B 495 (77.6%). More patients in Group A presented with circulatory collapse (Penn C 26.6% vs. 9.7%, P=0.001) while Group B presented with circulatory collapse-branch malperfusion (Penn BC 29.3% vs. 15.4% P=0.001). After propensity score matching, Group B patients received more complex aortic root (33.6% vs. 23.2%, P=0.019) and concomitant bypass surgery (12.3% vs. 6.3%, P=0.042). There was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality between age groups (18% vs. 12% P=0.12). In Group B, in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in females (22.2% vs. 8.2%, P=0.028). Differences in mortality disappeared after the age of 75 (18.3% vs. 19.4% P=0.87). Morbidity and mortality are comparable between patients under and over 75 years after AAAD repair. Female patients <75 had higher in-hospital mortality than their male counterparts."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are both life-threatening disorders. Because of their conflicting treatments, treatment becomes difficult when they occur together, and there is no standard treatment protocol. A 67-year-old man fell down the stairs due to syncope and was brought to our hospital as a confused and irritable patient who was uncooperative during the physical examination. Further examination of the head, chest and abdomen by computed tomography revealed a subdural hemorrhage, multiple rib fractures, a hemopneumothorax and a renal hematoma. He was admitted to the Emergency Intensive Care Unit and given a combination of oxygen therapy, external rib fixation, analgesia and enteral nutrition. The patient regained consciousness after 2 wk but complained of abdominal pain and dyspnea with an arterial partial pressure of oxygen of 8.66 kPa. Computed tomography angiograms confirmed that he had both AD and PE. We subsequently performed only nonsurgical treatment, including nasal high-flow oxygen therapy, nonsteroidal analgesia, amlodipine for blood pressure control, beta-blockers for heart rate control. Eight weeks after admission, the patient improved and was discharged from the hospital. Patients with AD should be alerted to the possibility of a combined PE, the development of which may be associated with aortic compression. In patients with type B AD combined with low-risk PE, a nonsurgical, nonanticoagulant treatment regimen may be feasible."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a fatal disease and requires emergency surgery. In particular, it is known that mortality is high when a coronary artery is involved. However, the degree of myocardial damage of the coronary acute artery involvement (ACI) varies and may or may not increase creatine kinase muscle and brain isoenzyme (CK-MB). It is unknown how CK-MB elevation affects the surgical outcome. This study compared the surgical results between the two groups of ACI with or without CK-MB elevation. Among 348 patients who underwent an emergency operation for acute type A aortic dissection, there were 28 (8.0%) patients complicated by ACI and underwent additional coronary artery bypass grafting. We divided 26 of those patients into two groups; the MI group ( with CK-MB elevation) and the NMI group (without CK-MB elevation), and compared both groups. Of the 26, sixteen were in the MI group, and ten were in the NMI group. The average CK-MB in the MI group was 225.5 IU/L, and that in the NMI group was 13.5 IU/L. The mean time from onset to surgery was 248 min in the MI group and 250 min in the NMI group. There was statistical significance in mortality ( 69% vs. 13%, p = 0.03). There was no significance in major complications (ICU days, reintubation, reoperation, pneumonia, sepsis). Acute coronary artery involvement was associated with 8.0% of patients with ATAAD, and 62% had myocardial ischemia with CK-MB elevation. The MI group had significantly higher mortality than the NMI group. It is crucial for cases with suspected ACI to obtain coronary perfusion as soon as possible to prevent CK-MB from elevating."

The study intended to identify the relationship between platelet (PLT) to platelet distribution width (PDW) ratio (PPR) and in-hospital mortality in postoperative patients with type A AAD. A total of 171 type A AAD patients were recruited in this retrospective study from January 2017 to December 2019. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) were exploited to determine the best cut-off value of PPR, and then patients were sub-grouped into the low-PPR group and high-PPR group, according to the optimal value of PPR. Finally, univariate, and multivariate analyses were carried out to examine the prognostic value of PPR. The value of PPR was 9.76, and the mortality was statistically higher in the low-PPR group than in the high-PPR group (29.1% vs. 6.0%, P < 0.01). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of PPR was 0.724 (95% CI, 0.633-0.815; P < 0.001) with a 56.4% sensitivity and 80.6% specificity. Multivariate analysis showed that serum PPR was an independent factor associated with in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio (HR): 1.151; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.035 -1.297; P = 0.010). Serum PPR can be used as an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality in postoperative patients with type A AAD."

A Kommerell's diverticulum (KD), a remnant of the dorsal aortic arch usually refers to an aneurysmal aortic enlargement at the origin of an aberrant left subclavian artery (ALSA) and is associated with an increased risk of aortic dissection. A 59-year-old female smoker with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia presented with a 24-hour history of sudden-onset and severe stabbing chest pain radiating to the interscapular region. Physical examination was normal except for bilateral basal crepitations. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed a type B aortic dissection in a RAArch with an ALSA arising from KD with a peri-aortic haematoma and haemothorax without any active contrast extravasation. After medical stabilization, a semi-urgent hybrid repair was performed with a right carotid-subclavian bypass, thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), a plug in the left subclavian artery, and left carotid-subclavian bypass due to severe ischaemia of the left arm. The postoperative CTA showed patent bypasses, aortic remodelling, and a minimal type IIa endoleak at the level of the ALSA. In patients with a type B dissection and KD, hybrid repair including TEVAR is feasible after careful pre-operative assessment of the patient's unique anatomy and may reduce post-surgical morbidity and mortality compared to open surgery. Prophylactic repair may be considered in patients with an asymptomatic RAArch and KD."

We retrospectively investigated the early outcomes of Sun's procedure in elderly patients with ATAAD in our single center. This study involved 106 patients who underwent Sun's procedure. The patients were divided into the elderly group (≥70 years, n = 17) and younger group (<70 years). Baseline, intraoperative, and postoperative data were compared between the groups. The mean age in the elderly and younger groups was 75.7 and 50.7 years, respectively. The type of aortic root operations were not significantly different between the groups. Concomitant surgeries were more frequently performed in the elderly group, but without statistical significance. All intraoperative cardiopulmonary bypass variables as well as the in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates were similar between the groups. The incidences of most postoperative complications were also similar except for a higher incidence of sepsis in the elderly group. Emergency performance of Sun's procedure for patients with ATAAD characterized by dissection and/or entry tear in the aortic arch should not be denied on the basis of advanced age alone. Comparable early in-hospital outcomes can be achieved in elderly patients."

    "abstract": "Background Acute aortic syndromes may be prone to misdiagnosis by nonreferral aortic centers with less diagnostic experience. We evaluated regional variability in these misdiagnosis trends among patients transferred to different regional quaternary care centers with presumed acute aortic syndromes. Methods and Results Two institutional aortic center databases were retrospectively reviewed for emergency transfers in patients diagnosed with acute aortic dissection, intramural hematoma, penetrating aortic ulcer, thoracic aortic aneurysm, or aortic pseudoaneurysm between 2008 and 2020. Transferring diagnoses versus actual diagnoses were reviewed using physician notes and radiology reports. Misdiagnoses were confirmed by a board-certified cardiothoracic surgeon. A total of 3772 inpatient transfers were identified, of which 1762 patients were classified as emergency transfers. The mean age was 64 years (58% male). Patients were transferred from 203 medical centers by ground (51%) or air (49%). Differences in transfer diagnosis and actual diagnosis were identified in 188 (10.7%) patients. Of those, incorrect classification of Type A versus B dissections was identified among 23%, and 30% of patients with a referring diagnosis of an acute aortic dissection did not have one. In addition, 14% transferred for contained/impending rupture did not have signs of rupture. All misdiagnoses were secondary to misinterpretation of imaging, with motion artifacts (n=32, 17%) and postsurgical changes (n=44, 23%) being common sources of diagnostic error. Conclusions Misdiagnosis of acute aortic syndromes commonly occurred in patients transferred to 2 separate large aortic referral centers. Although diagnostic accuracy may be improving, there are opportunities for improved physician awareness through standardized web-based imaging education."

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms can either be treated by open surgery or endovascular repair. In both cases, prostheses are implanted to prevent potentially lethal aortic ruptures. Studies seeking to identify the optimal treatment came to diverging conclusions. The goal of this article is to shed light on the discussion of which treatment option is to be preferred. This article summarizes the relevant studies on elective and emergency abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. The presented studies are discussed, and results are interpreted and compared. While most studies indicate lower short-term mortality rates in endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), mortality rates converged in multiple trials and even showed a lower mortality rate for open repair in mid-term analyses. Most recent studies indicate long-term equivalence in terms of mortality and a higher rate of secondary interventions in EVAR patients. The current body of literature indicates no real advantage of one therapy over another. The choice of therapy should depend on anatomic, clinical, and logistic criteria. HINTERGRUND: Das Bauchaortenaneurysma ist ein potenziell letales Krankheitsbild, das sowohl offen-chirurgisch als auch endovaskulär mittels Implantation einer Endoprothese behandelt werden kann. ZIEL: Trotz zahlreicher Studien ist die Frage, welche Therapieform zu bevorzugen ist, unübersichtlich. Daher soll eine Übersicht der relevanten Literatur vorgestellt und diskutiert werden. Dieser Beitrag fasst die wichtigsten Publikationen zu den Themen der elektiven und notfallmäßigen Behandlung von Bauchaortenaneurysmen in einer kurzen Übersicht zusammen. Die publizierten Ergebnisse werden einander gegenübergestellt und interpretiert. Die meisten randomisiert-kontrollierten Studien kommen zu dem Schluss, dass die endovaskuläre Aneurysmareparatur (EVAR) mit einer geringeren perioperativen Mortalität verbunden ist. Dieser kurzfristige Vorteil nivelliert sich allerdings nach wenigen Jahren wieder; in einigen Studien war die endovaskuläre Therapie sogar hinsichtlich der Mortalität nach 2–5 Jahren unterlegen. Neueste Daten zeigen allerdings keine signifikanten Überlebensunterschiede in der Langzeitbetrachtung. In allen Studien war die höhere Rate an sekundären Interventionen die Hauptlimitation der EVAR. Da die Ergebnisse beider Verfahren langfristig vergleichbar sind, können beide auch weiterhin Anwendung finden. Die Wahl des Verfahrens hängt von klinischen, anatomischen und nicht zuletzt auch logistischen Kriterien ab."

    "abstract": "The adventitial inversion technique is used widely for aortic reconstruction for acute type A aortic dissection, as it easily controls the bleeding at anastomotic sites and closes the patent false lumen. However, this technique for arch vessel reconstruction has not been previously reported. Therefore, we applied the adventitial inversion technique for dissected arch vessel reconstruction to close the patent false lumen. Among 57 consecutive patients who underwent emergency surgical treatment for acute type A aortic dissection from July 2006 to July 2012, the adventitial inversion technique for the dissected arch vessels was performed in 26 patients (42 arch vessel stumps). The patency and morphologic change of the false lumen of the arch vessels were evaluated using contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Overall, 2 hospital deaths were recorded, and the hospital mortality rate was 4%. No postoperative cerebral strokes and reoperations due to bleeding occurred. Follow-up by contrast-enhanced computed tomography was completed in 24 patients (37 stumps) with a mean duration of 99 ± 35 months. The postoperative closure rate of the false lumen after adventitial inversion was 86%, which was higher than when adventitial inversion was not used. No adverse events including stroke occurred during follow-up period. This technique facilitates the closure of the false lumen of dissected arch vessels and might improve clinical outcomes."

Electrocardiogram, laboratory tests, and computed tomography (CT) angiography of aorta were performed and ruled out aortic dissection and cardiovascular events. However, new complaint of odynophagia, dysphagia, and incidental findings in CT angiography proposed esophageal pathologies. After initial workup including upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, intramural esophageal hematoma was diagnosed. Laboratory tests revealed significant reduction in the hemoglobin level. Management of warfarin-induced major bleeding in a patient whom anticoagulation was necessary for the prevention of mechanical heart valve thrombosis was challenging. The patient recovered fully with conservative treatment and was discharged on hospital day 14 with low molecular weight heparin. We described a case of intramural esophageal hematoma as a rare condition that could be misdiagnosed as a cardiovascular emergent disease and would be worsened by antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy. Accordingly, it is important to differentiate intramural esophageal hematoma from cardiac ischemic events. Another challenge was correction of coagulation in the presence of mechanical mitral valve. Fortunately, we had a favorable outcome following conservative management."

We aimed to evaluate trends and clinical predictors of hospital readmissions in patients undergoing medical management and TEVAR for acute TBADs. The Nationwide Readmissions Database was queried for all 30-day and 90-day index readmissions (30D-IR and 90D-IR, respectively) after a diagnosis of a TBAD from January 2012 to September 2015. Data on readmission diagnosis, patient demographics, and hospital characteristics were collected from readmitted patients and analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify the predictors of readmission after TEVAR or medical medical management of TBAD. We identified 53,117 patients with acute TBAD. Medical management was the initial treatment modality in 46,985 (88.4%) patients, while 6,132 (11.5%) underwent TEVAR. Factors including older patient age, lower household income, severity of comorbidities, initial hospital length of stay, and urgent procedure demonstrated an increased likelihood of experiencing 30D-IR and 90D-IR (P<0.05). The rate of unplanned readmission for patients undergoing medical management remained stable (11.3% vs. 10.0% for 30D-IR; 19.1% vs. 15.5% for 90D-IR). Reasons for unplanned readmission in the TEVAR cohort were largely related to technical complications. There was no significant difference in readmission costs between medical management and TEVAR. Number of unplanned readmissions in the TEVAR arm decreased significantly over time, whereas the number of readmissions for medical management remained stable."

The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of physician-modified TEVAR (pmTEVAR) vs. hybrid repair of the thoracic aorta in terms of TEVAR with carotid-subclavian bypass (hdTEVAR). This was a single-centre, retrospective comparative study of all patients who underwent pmTEVAR and hybrid repair of the proximal descending aorta from January 2018 to June 2021. Primary outcomes were technical success, 30-day mortality, perioperative stroke, 30-day reinterventions and supraaortic access related complications. Secondary outcomes were patient survival, late complications, late reinterventions, and bypass/bridging stent patency. A total of 181 patients underwent TEVAR within the period of 42 months. In our study, only patients with proximal landing in zone 2 (n = 39) were included. A total of 5 of 15 pmTEVAR and 8 of 24 hybrid repair operations (33% vs. 33%, respectively) were performed due to aneurysms. Among the rest of the patients, 10 of 15 pmTEVAR and 16 of 24 hybrid operations (67% vs. 67%) were performed due to aortic dissection. Technical success was achieved in 100% of the patients. No significant difference in terms of postoperative complications could be detected in the early and midterm follow up period. The 30-day mortality was 12.5% in the hybrid repair group (n = 3) vs. 6.66% (n = 1) in the pmTEVAR group (p = 0.498). These patients underwent the operation in an emergency setting. No patient died after an elective operation. The causes of early mortality were major stroke (n = 2), haemorrhagic shock (n = 1) in the hybrid group and progredient spinal cord ischemia with tetraplegia and acute respiratory insufficiency (n = 1) in the pmTEVAR group. In conclusion, both therapies are robust techniques, with comparable patency rate and perioperative complications. pmTEVAR appears to be advantageous in terms of operation time and tendency to lower mortality rates."

From April 2015 to July 2021, 72 patients (25 women, 60.4 ± 10.3 years) underwent Thoraflex™ Hybrid implantation at our institution. The indications were thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) (n = 16, 22.2%), post-dissection aneurysm (n = 21, 29.2%), and acute aortic dissection (AAD) (n = 35, 48.6%). Antegrade cerebral perfusion under moderate hypothermia (28°C) was employed in all cases. Eighteen patients (25%) have already been operated due to heart or aortic disease. Overall in-hospital mortality was 12.5% (9 patients). Rates of permanent neurological dysfunction and spinal cord injury were 9.7 and 5.5%, respectively. The in-hospital mortality rate among patients operated on AAD, TAA, and post-dissection aneurysm were 8.6, 6.2, and 23.8%, respectively. At a mean follow-up of 26 ± 20 months, mortality was 9.7%. Furthermore, 23 patients (31.9%) required a subsequent procedure in distal aorta: endovascular stentgraft extension in 19 patients (26.4%) and open aortic surgery in 4 patients (5.5%). The mid-term survival of patients with type A aortic dissection was 97%. Our experience with the Thoraflex Hybrid prosthesis demonstrates its surgical applicability for different types of aortic pathologies with promising outcomes during early and midterm follow-up. Our technique and perioperative management lead to comparable or even superior neurological outcomes and mortality in urgent cases considering other high-volume centers."

    "abstract": "Despite the increasing availability of clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) and rising expectation for CDSSs based on artificial intelligence (AI), little is known about the acceptance of AI-based CDSS by physicians and its barriers and facilitators in emergency care settings. We aimed to evaluate the acceptance, barriers, and facilitators to implementing AI-based CDSSs in the emergency care setting through the opinions of physicians on our newly developed, real-time AI-based CDSS, which alerts ED physicians by predicting aortic dissection based on numeric and text information from medical charts, by using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT; for quantitative evaluation) and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR; for qualitative evaluation) frameworks. This mixed methods study was performed from March to April 2021. Transitional year residents (n=6), emergency medicine residents (n=5), and emergency physicians (n=3) from two community, tertiary care hospitals in Japan were included. We first developed a real-time CDSS for predicting aortic dissection based on numeric and text information from medical charts (eg, chief complaints, medical history, vital signs) with natural language processing. This system was deployed on the internet, and the participants used the system with clinical vignettes of model cases. Participants were then involved in a mixed methods evaluation consisting of a UTAUT-based questionnaire with a 5-point Likert scale (quantitative) and a CFIR-based semistructured interview (qualitative). Cronbach α was calculated as a reliability estimate for UTAUT subconstructs. Interviews were sampled, transcribed, and analyzed using the MaxQDA software. The framework analysis approach was used during the study to determine the relevance of the CFIR constructs. All 14 participants completed the questionnaires and interviews. Quantitative analysis revealed generally positive responses for user acceptance with all scores above the neutral score of 3.0. In addition, the mixed methods analysis identified two significant barriers (System Performance, Compatibility) and two major facilitators (Evidence Strength, Design Quality) for implementation of AI-based CDSSs in emergency care settings. Our mixed methods evaluation based on theoretically grounded frameworks revealed the acceptance, barriers, and facilitators of implementation of AI-based CDSS. Although the concern of system failure and overtrusting of the system could be barriers to implementation, the locality of the system and designing an intuitive user interface could likely facilitate the use of optimal AI-based CDSS. Alleviating and resolving these factors should be key to achieving good user acceptance of AI-based CDSS."

    "abstract": "Pericardial tamponade requires timely diagnosis and management. It carries a high mortality rate. This review incorporates available evidence to clarify misconceptions regarding the clinical presentation, while providing an in-depth expert guide on bedside echocardiography. It also details the decision-making strategy for emergency management including pericardiocentesis, along with pre- and peri-procedural pearls and pitfalls. Pericardial effusions causing tamponade arise from diverse etiologies across acute and sub-acute time courses. The most frequently reported symptom is dyspnea. The classically taught Beck's triad (which includes hypotension) does not appear commonly. Echocardiographic findings include: a pericardial effusion (larger size associated with tamponade), diastolic right ventricular collapse (specific), systolic right atrial collapse (sensitive), a plethoric non-collapsible inferior vena cava (sensitive), and sonographic pulsus paradoxus. Emergent pericardiocentesis is warranted by hemodynamic instability, impending deterioration, or cardiac arrest. Emergent surgical indications include type A aortic dissection causing hemopericardium, ventricular free wall rupture after acute myocardial infarction, severe chest trauma, and iatrogenic hemopericardium when bleeding cannot be controlled percutaneously. Pre-procedure management includes blood products for patients with traumatic hemopericardium; gentle intravenous fluids to hypotensive, hypovolemic patients with consideration for vasoactive medications; treatment of anticoagulation, coagulopathies, and anemia. Positive-pressure ventilation and intravenous sedation can lower cardiac output and should be avoided if possible. Optimal location for echocardiography-guided pericardiocentesis is the largest, shallowest fluid pocket with no intervening vital structures. Patient positioning to prevent hypoxia and liberal amounts of local anesthesia can facilitate patients remaining still. Safe needle guidance and confirmation of catheter placement is achieved using low-depth sonographic views, injection of agitated saline, and evaluation of initial aspirate for hemorrhage. Pericardial fluid should be drained slowly to avoid pericardial decompression syndrome. An understanding of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, echocardiographic findings, and time-sensitive management of pericardial tamponade is essential for emergency physicians."

    "abstract": "In individuals with heritable thoracic aortic disease (HTAD), endovascular repair for treatment of aortic aneurysm and dissection may be lifesaving, but is associated with increased risk of failure of endovascular repair and adverse outcomes. This study reports our experience with early and late outcomes of endovascular aortic and branch vessel repair in patients with HTAD. A retrospective case series was performed by chart review of individuals with HTAD followed at Washington University School of Medicine/Barnes-Jewish Hospital who underwent endovascular aortic and/or branch vessel repair. Clinical features, imaging characteristics, and short- and long-term outcomes were collected. Twenty-nine patients with HTAD (20 male; mean age 45 ± 13 years) underwent 37 endovascular procedures between 2006 and 2020 with mean follow up of 54 ± 41 months. Seven patients underwent two or more separate endovascular procedures. Each procedure was considered separate for data collection and analysis. Underlying conditions included Marfan syndrome (n = 16 procedures), Loeys-Dietz syndrome (n = 14 procedures), vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (n = 3 procedures), and nonsyndromic HTAD (n = 4 procedures). Twenty patients (69%) had prior open surgical aortic repair. Indications for endovascular aortic repair (n = 31) included urgent repairs of acute complications of aortic dissection (n = 10) or aneurysm rupture (n = 3), and elective aortic repair (n = 18; 10 chronic dissections and eight chronic aneurysms). Six patients underwent elective endovascular repair of six branch vessel aneurysms or dissections. Six patients underwent hybrid open surgical and endovascular repair. Of the 37 procedures, 25 (68%) proximal landing zones were in the native aorta or branch vessel, 11 (30%) were in a surgical graft or elephant trunk and one was in a previously placed endograft. Thirty-six (97%) procedures were technically successful, and none required emergency surgical conversion. Two patients died: one from sepsis and one from presumed late pseudoaneurysm rupture, for a 5% per-procedure mortality rate. Two procedures were complicated by stroke and one patient developed paraparesis. Of the 31 aortic procedures, seven aortic endografts (23%) developed a stent-induced new entry (SINE) discovered with imaging at 20 ± 15 days post-procedure. Seven endografts (23%) developed a Type I endoleak and eight (26%) developed a Type II endoleak. No Type III endoleaks were seen. Within 30 days, two endografts (of 37, 5%) required reintervention. After 30 days, fifteen additional endografts (of 37, 41%) required reintervention. Two patients (of 6, 33%) who underwent hybrid repair required reintervention. This study is the largest single-center case series examining outcomes of HTAD patients following endovascular repair. Urgent and elective endovascular repairs in patients with HTAD can manage acute and chronic complications of aortic aneurysm and dissection with relatively low risk. However, risk of early and late endoleaks and SINE is high. Close post-procedural surveillance is required, and many individuals will require additional interventions. Hybrid repair shows promise and requires further investigation."

    "title": "Type A Aortic Dissection Repair in Patients With Prior Cardiac Surgery.",
    "abstract": "Emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection in patients with previous cardiac surgery is controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the association between previous cardiac surgery and outcomes after surgery for acute type A aortic dissection, to appreciate whether emergency surgery can be offered with acceptable risks. All patients operated on for acute type A aortic dissection between 2005 and 2014 from the Nordic Consortium for Acute Type A Aortic Dissection database were eligible. Patients with previous cardiac surgery were compared with patients without previous cardiac surgery. Univariable and multivariable statistical analyses were performed to identify predictors of 30-day mortality and early major adverse events (a secondary composite endpoint comprising 30-day mortality, perioperative stroke, postoperative cardiac arrest, or de novo dialysis). In all, 1159 patients were included, 40 (3.5%) with previous cardiac surgery. Patients with previous cardiac surgery had higher 30-day mortality (30% vs 17.8%, P = .049), worse medium-term survival (51.7% vs 71.2% at 5 years, log rank P = .020), and higher unadjusted prevalence of major adverse events (52.5% vs 35.7%, P = .030). In multivariable analysis, previous cardiac surgery was not associated with 30-day mortality (odds ratio 0.78; 95% CI, 0.30-2.07; P = .624) or major adverse events (odds ratio 1.07; 95% CI, 0.45-2.55, P = .879). Major adverse events after surgery for acute type A aortic dissection were more frequent in patients with previous cardiac surgery. Previous cardiac surgery itself was not an independent predictor for adverse events, although the small sample size precludes definite conclusions. Previous cardiac surgery should not deter from emergency surgery."

    "abstract": "We present a case of Brown-Séquard syndrome (BSS) after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) to treat Stanford type B aortic dissection. A 49-year-old male presented to the emergency department with acute tearing pain between the scapulae, connected to respiratory movements. Computed tomography showed Stanford type B aortic dissection from the left subclavian artery to the level of the 11th thoracic vertebra. Conservative treatment was initiated with intravenous antihypertensives. However, due to persistent pain and an increase in the aortic diameter with an intramural hematoma, TEVAR was performed. The patient developed symptoms suspicious of spinal cord ischemia postoperatively. A lesion limited to the left-sided spinal cord was observed on magnetic resonance imaging at the level of the 4th to 5th thoracic vertebra. BSS after TEVAR is a rare phenomenon with a fairly good prognosis, depending on the initial injury severity."

    "title": "Simple Death Risk Models to Predict In-hospital Outcomes in Acute Aortic Dissection in Emergency Department.",
    "abstract": "We sought to find a bedside prognosis prediction model based on clinical and image parameters to determine the in-hospital outcomes of acute aortic dissection (AAD) in the emergency department. Patients who presented with AAD from January 2010 to December 2019 were retrospectively recruited in our derivation cohort. Then we prospectively collected patients with AAD from January 2020 to December 2021 as the validation cohort. We collected the demographics, medical history, treatment options, and in-hospital outcomes. All enrolled patients underwent computed tomography angiography. The image data were systematically reviewed for anatomic criteria in a retrospective fashion by three professional radiologists. A series of radiological parameters, including the extent of dissection, the site of the intimal tear, entry tear diameter, aortic diameter at each level, maximum false lumen diameter, and presence of pericardial effusion were collected. Of the 449 patients in the derivation cohort, 345 (76.8%) were male, the mean age was 61 years, and 298 (66.4%) had a history of hypertension. Surgical repair was performed in 327 (72.8%) cases in the derivation cohort, and the overall crude in-hospital mortality of AAD was 10.9%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that predictors of in-hospital mortality in AAD included age, Marfan syndrome, type A aortic dissection, surgical repair, and maximum false lumen diameter. A final prognostic model incorporating these five predictors showed good calibration and discrimination in the derivation and validation cohorts. As for type A aortic dissection, 3-level type A aortic dissection clinical prognosis score (3ADPS) including 5 clinical and image variables scored from -2 to 5 was established: (1) moderate risk of death if 3ADPS is <0; (2) high risk of death if 3ADPS is 1-2; (3) very high risk of death if 3ADPS is more than 3. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curves in the validation cohorts was 0.833 (95% CI, 0.700-0.967). Age, Marfan syndrome, type A aortic dissection, surgical repair, and maximum false lumen diameter can significantly affect the in-hospital outcomes of AAD. And 3ADPS contributes to the prediction of in-hospital prognosis of type A aortic dissection rapidly and effectively. As multivariable risk prediction tools, the risk models were readily available for emergency doctors to predict in-hospital mortality of patients with AAD in extreme clinical risk."

    "abstract": "Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) is defined as acute intestinal ischemia because of decreased blood flow in mesenteric vessels. Only a few cases of NOMI that occur secondary to aortic dissection (AD) have been reported, resulting in the lack of sufficient knowledge of diagnosis and treatment. We aimed to report a case of NOMI caused by type B Aortic Dissection. A 26-year-old male patient was transferred to our hospital with the diagnose of NOMI and aortic dissection in April 2018. The abdominal computed tomography (CT) assists the diagnosis of paralytic intestinal obstruction, intestinal wall pneumatosis, and perforation. Emergency laparotomy revealed that the bowel wall supplied by the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was pale with the palpable but weak pulsation of the parietal artery. The small intestine was extremely dilated with a paper-thin, fragile wall that was ruptured easily and could not be sutured. In this case, extensive resection and segmental drainage were done. Postoperatively, the digestive tract was reconstructed. However, the patient suffered from iron deficiency anemia and short bowel syndrome eight months later, and unfortunately died from long-term complications. Aortic dissection leads to continuous decrease in blood pressure and blood flow to the SMA, considering as a predisposing factor for NOMI. During the treatment, extensive resection and segmental drainage are the optimal surgical strategy, which can make benefit in emergencies especially."

    "abstract": "Whether extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is indicated for patients with pulseless electrical activity (PEA) remains unclear. Pulmonary embolism with PEA is a good candidate for ECPR; however, PEA can sometimes include an aortic disease and intracranial haemorrhage, with extremely poor neurological outcomes, and can thus not be used as a suitable candidate. We began employing an ECPR strategy that utilised a hybrid emergency room (ER) to perform computed tomography (CT) before extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) induction from January 2020. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of this ECPR strategy. Medical records of patients who transferred to our hybrid ER and required ECPR for PEA between January 2020 and November 2021 were reviewed. Twelve consecutive patients (median age, 67 [range, 57-73] years) with PEA requiring ECPR were identified in our hybrid ER. Among these patients, nine were diagnosed using an initial CT scan (intracranial haemorrhage (3); cardiac tamponade due to aortic dissection (3); aortic rupture (2); and cardiac rupture (1)), and unnecessary ECMO was avoided. The remaining three patients underwent ECPR, and two of them survived with favourable neurological outcomes. Patients not indicated for ECPR were excluded before ECMO induction. Our ECPR strategy that involved the utilisation of a hybrid ER may be useful for the exclusion of patients with PEA not indicated for ECPR and decision making."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a rare, life-threatening condition for which the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD) remains the most detailed clinical resource. The present study compared the characteristics, clinical findings and outcomes of patients presenting to Liverpool Hospital, NSW, Australia (LPOOL) with AAD to those in IRAD. Secondary aims were to identify LPOOL patient variables associated with 30-day mortality and to assess the impact of transfer times in the ED on 30-day mortality. Retrospective observational study of patients presenting to LPOOL with AAD between 2011 and 2019. Clinical records were examined and compared with IRAD data. Variables in LPOOL associated (P < 0.10) with 30-day mortality by univariable analysis were subsequently entered in a multivariable logistic regression to identify independent predictors. Mediation analysis was performed to assess the impact of ED transfer times on 30-day mortality. The characteristics, clinical findings and outcomes of 156 LPOOL patients were overall similar to those in IRAD. Syncope, weakness or paralysis, raised lactate and chest X-ray abnormalities were identified as independent predictors of 30-day mortality. Time from ED to ICU explained 28% of the variance in survival at 30 days. The characteristics, clinical features and outcomes of patients with AAD presenting to LPOOL appeared similar to those reported by IRAD. The identification of independent mortality predictors serves to improve the understanding of local AAD presentations. Reducing ED to ICU transfer times may increase 30-day survival and further interdisciplinary research should be considered."

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to clarify the impact of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic on emergency management of acute type A aortic dissection. We consecutively enrolled 337 acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) patients at emergency room in Fuwai Hospital (Beijing, China) from January to June during the 2020 COVID-19 epidemic (n = 148) and the same period in 2019 as the historical control (n = 189). The primary outcome was defined as in-hospital death. Other outcomes included automatic discharge during emergency admission. The factors with significant differences before and after the epidemic were compared and analyzed by stages with the study endpoint to clarify their changes in different stages of the epidemic. There was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality (35 (20.5%) vs. 23 (17.4%), p = 0.472). Compared with year 2019, proportion of patients receiving surgical treatment decreased significantly (74 (50.0%) vs. 129 (68.25%), p < 0.001). The surgery time of ATAAD patients in 2020 was significantly shorter (6.46 [5.52, 7.51] vs. 7.33 [6.00, 8.85] hours, p = 0.01). The length of stay in the emergency department significantly differed at each stage. Our study demonstrated a significant reduction in the number of ATAAD patients and surgical treatment during COVID-19 outbreak. The surgical strategy of patients changed, but the overall mortality was largely the same. Patients undergoing surgery had a trend toward longer interval from the onset to the operating room, but they tended to be normal at the end of the epidemic. Proper epidemic prevention policies may avoid COVID-19 hitting patients who are not infected with the virus to the greatest extent."

    "abstract": "Rare diseases are serious and chronic diseases that affect no more than 1 person in 2000 (in European Union criteria). Patients suffering from RDs may come to the emergency department for life-threatening symptoms, such as acute aortic dissection, intracranial haemorrhage, and severe respiratory distress. Diagnostic delay of rare disease patients is common and often caused by low rare disease awareness among physicians. The main aim of this study was to investigate Chinese emergency physicians' basic knowledge, information access and educational needs regarding rare diseases. An online questionnaire was completed by Chinese emergency physicians during January and March 2021. A total of 539 emergency physicians, including 200 females and 339 males, responded to the questionnaire-based study. More than half of the respondents were from Tertiary A hospitals and had engaged in medical clinical work for more than 10 years. Only 4.27% of respondents correctly estimated the prevalence of rare diseases. A few respondents knew the exact number of RDs in the first official list of rare diseases in 2018. A total of 98.5% of respondents rated their knowledge about rare diseases as minimal or insufficient. Most emergency physicians preferred to obtain information through search engines instead of specialized websites on rare diseases. A lack of practice guidelines or consensus was considered the most important reason for the diagnostic delay of RD. Practice guidelines or consensus and professional websites on rare diseases are urgently needed for emergency physicians. The investigation shows poor knowledge of rare diseases among emergency physicians. Practice guidelines and professional websites on rare diseases were the primary urgent needs for emergency physicians. Specialized RD courses should also be added to medical education."

Antegrade perfusion to diminish further organ malperfusion and ischemia is preferable. We retrospectively analyzed a total of 420 patients who underwent AAD surgery from January 2001 to December 2020. Group A included 229 patients with a transatrial cannulation; group B included 191 patients with all other additionally used cannulation sites. A retrospective analysis was conducted at 30 days and according to clinical outcome and midterm mortality. Risk factors for probability of death were analyzed by multifactorial logistic regression. The calculated risk scores and demographic preoperative variables were comparable except for hyperlipoproteinemia (P = .011) and redo operation in group B (P < .001) and more pericardial tamponade in group A (P = .006). In addition, fewer patients with postoperative new onset of renal failure were observed in group A (P = .039), although new onset of dialysis was not different between the groups (P = .878). Patients in group A were discharged from the hospital significantly earlier (P = .004). Nevertheless, although significantly more total arch surgery was performed in group A, shorter operation times (P < .001) and lower transfusion rates were observed in group A. Patients' follow-up after a median time of 3.6 (0.6-7.6) years showed no difference in 30-day, 1-year, and long-term mortality. Multivariate logistic regression revealed aortic valve stenosis (P = .041), coronary artery bypass graft surgical procedures (P = .014), preoperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation (P < .001), and length of surgery (P = .032) as the strongest risk factors for mortality. Transatrial cannulation for AAD operation was safe and successfully performed under emergent conditions. Although no benefit in mortality was achieved, clinical benefits of shorter operation times, less transfusion, better kidney preservation, and earlier discharge of the patient were observed."

The purpose of this study is to assess early feasibility of using these investigational devices to treat ascending aortic dissection. This a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, single-arm study that enrolls patients at high surgical risk with appropriate anatomical requirements based on computed tomography imaging at 7 of 9 US sites. Devices are delivered transfemorally under fluoroscopic guidance. Primary endpoint is all-cause mortality at 30 days. Secondary endpoints include major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) at 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months. Nineteen patients were enrolled with a mean age of 75.7 years (range 47-91) and 11 (57.9%) were female. Ten (52.6%) had DeBakey type I disease, and the rest were type II. Sixteen (84.2%) of the patients were acute. Patients were treated with safe access, (7/19 (36.8%) percutaneous, 10/19 (52.6%) transfemoral, 2/19 (10.5%) iliac conduit), delivery, and deployment completed in all cases. Median procedure time was 154 mins (range 52-392) and median contrast used was 111 mL (range 75-200). MACCE at 30 days occurred in 5 patients including mortality 3/19 (15.8%), disabling stroke in 1/19 (5.3%), and myocardial infarction in 1/19 (5.3%). Results from the ARISE early feasibility study of a specific ascending stent graft device to treat ascending aortic dissection are promising."

    "abstract": "From its first use in medicine, ultrasonography has been an excellent non-invasive diagnostic tool. The use of ultrasound increased dramatically especially in the last decade, as it is a painless, safe, and widely accessible, especially with the development of pocket ultrasound machines. In addition, it is crucial in promptly diagnosing unstable patients in emergency settings. Currently, emergency physicians are leaning more towards ultrasound, fellowships and university courses are created around the globe to teach this essential skill. This article highlights the importance of ultrasound in the hands of emergency physicians while presenting a life-threatening diagnosis that could have been easily missed if it wasn't for the use of ultrasound. Cases like these are frequently seen in the emergency departments, and it is when blinded by a tunnel vision, and anchoring bias, that these serious diagnoses can be left undiagnosed. Many individuals in the medical community are against the use of ultrasound by untrained physicians, but it remains highly recommended that emergency physicians get a proper training on the use of this tool for it is of great value in the emergency department."

A total of 108 patients diagnosed with ATAAD who underwent emergency operation under hypothermic circulatory arrest were enrolled in this study. Demographic characteristics and perioperative data were recorded. In all patients, preoperative chest and abdomen computed tomography (CT) scans were performed. Median age of the patients was 61.5 (52.5-70.5) years and median body mass index (BMI) was 28.2 (25.1-32.6) cm2. The number of female patients was 37 (25%). Median diameter of the ascending aorta was 5.0 (4.5-6) cm and 53.8% of the patients had an aortic diameter < 5.0 cm, while 32.3% of the patients had an aortic diameter of 4.5cm and 72.0% had an ascending aorta diameter < 5.5 cm. The diameter of the ascending aorta did not differ in patients with vs without preoperative adverse events: Preoperative neurological dysfunction (P = 0.53) and hemodynamic instability (P = 0.43). Median age of patients with preoperative hemodynamic instability was 65 (57.5-74) years, while it was 60 (51-68) years in patients without (P = 0.04). Although current guidelines suggest replacing the ascending aorta with a diameter > 5.5 cm, most of the patients with ATAAD had an aortic diameter of less than 5.5 cm.

    "abstract": "A hypothermic circulatory arrest is usually used to correct thoracic aorta pathologies. The emergency treatment of acute type A aortic dissection and elective repair of aortic arch pathologies are the most common indications for using hypothermic circulatory arrest. A hypothermic circulatory arrest can also be used for surgical pulmonary thromboendarterectomy in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Intervals with total circulatory arrest offer a clear surgical field for thrombus and emboli removal from the pulmonary artery branches. The price to pay for intermittent circulatory arrest during pulmonary thromboendarterectomy is postoperative neurological dysfunction due to brain hypothermia and hypoperfusion. A noninvasive method for cerebral monitoring during cardiac surgery is real-time regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2 ). Liu et al. report that continuous monitoring of rSO2 during surgical pulmonary thromboendarterectomy may reduce the long cerebral hypoperfusion time and prevent postoperative neurological dysfunction."

In patients with cardiac tamponade, hemodynamic collapse may lead to acute renal and hepatic failure. We report the successful treatment of a 55-year-old woman with SLE since the age of 21. She suddenly felt chest pain approximately 2 weeks before developing fever and vomiting and was admitted to our hospital. Initially, she had severe liver dysfunction and was admitted to the hepatology department, where treatment for fulminant hepatitis was initiated. However, computed tomography (CT) showed an acute aortic dissection (DeBakey type II) and severe bloody pericardial effusion. Therefore, we performed emergency pericardial drainage. Plasma exchange therapy was initiated as emergency aortic surgery was deemed impossible due to impaired liver function tests and coagulation. Ten days later, the patient developed peritonitis due to small bowel perforation, and laparotomy was performed for abscess drainage and perforation closure. She had received steroid pulse therapy at the age of 21. At 40 years of age, she developed deep vein thrombosis due to antiphospholipid antibodies and was prescribed prednisolone. She was ambulatory at 3 months after the onset of acute aortic dissection, and CT revealed a rapidly enlarging true aneurysm in the distal arch. We performed elective aortic surgery. Although there were no antiphospholipid antibodies, surgery could have led to a devastating antiphospholipid syndrome. Therefore, we decided to treat the patient with triple therapy. Methylprednisolone was intravenously administered intraoperatively and at 1 day postoperatively. The patient was discharged without complications after returning to her usual oral prednisolone regimen. The patient described herein had a systemic circulatory failure due to cardiac tamponade, accompanied by liver failure. This condition is a significant cause of death in patients with aortic dissection-associated SLE and is extremely dangerous. However, multi-specialty intervention helped the patient recover, and she has been attending the outpatient clinic. Aortic surgery requiring hypothermia in SLE patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and a history of thrombocytopenia or thrombosis requires a multi-disciplinary treatment team, including cardiac surgeons and medical experts."

    "abstract": "Although hemodilution during hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) had been thought to improve microcirculation and reduce blood viscosity, there has been no report investigating the effect of low nadir hematocrit (Hct) values caused by severe hemodilution on the surgical outcomes of patients with acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD). We retrospectively reviewed 112 consecutive patients who emergently underwent emergency surgical repair of ATAAD at our institution. The patients were classified into the high Hct (nadir Hct ≥ 21% during CPB; n = 51) and low Hct (nadir Hct < 21% during CPB; n = 61) groups. After propensity score matching of preoperative characteristics, surgical outcomes were compared between the groups. Although there was no difference in the surgical procedure, longer CPB time and more blood transfusion during surgery were needed in the low Hct group than in the high Hct group. After surgery, estimated glomerular filtration rate was significantly lower (p = .015), lactaic acid was higher (p = .045), and intubation time was longer (p = .018) in the low Hct group than in the high Hct group, although there was no difference in hospital mortality between the groups. The AUC of the nadir Hct during CPB as a prognostic indicator of prolonged postoperative ventilator support was 0.8, with the highest accuracy at 16.7% (sensitivity 88%, specificity 76.9%). In all cohorts, female sex was an independent risk factor for a lower nadir Hct value of <21% during CPB. A lower nadir Hct value of <21% during CPB may be associated with postoperative renal dysfunction and prolonged ventilator support in patients with ATAAD."

    "abstract": "Although the surgical technique for acute type A aortic dissection dramatically improved in recent years, the postoperative mortality and morbidity rates remain high. After the emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection, a small tear in the aorta may result in dilation of the false lumen in the future. Some tears originate from the suture line on the anastomosis. This report introduces the novel \"plaster technique\" that involves using a single interrupted suture with felt and plastering a minimum dose of BioGlue into the suture hole. Similar to patients with acute aortic dissection, we found that the plaster technique using a felt pledget and minimum dose of BioGlue is effective for fragile aortic walls. Moreover, it is a simple, safe, and durable technique to strengthen the suture line. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12055-022-01351-0."

Hemodilution is inevitable in cardiac operations performed with cardiopulmonary bypass, which leads to nadir hematocrit levels. Studies have shown that nadir hematocrit levels are associated with poor postoperative outcomes. The management strategy of intraoperative anemia in these operations is still controversial. Should we follow the patients with intraoperative low hematocrit values or should we transfuse them? In addition to intraoperative nadir hematocrit, cannulation strategies play an important role in early postoperative outcomes after aortic dissection surgery."

A retrospective chart review was performed for all patients belonging to a geographically isolated health maintenance organization who underwent CTA evaluation for possible acute AoD in the emergency department between 2016 and 2020. We evaluated for the regions included in the CTA, the presence of an acute AoD, and clinical outcomes. For those who were ruled-out of an AoD with a CTA limited to the chest, we investigated clinical follow-up up to 6 months after their initial presentation. Over the study period, there were 1143 CT scans ordered by ED physicians to evaluate for AoD in patients without a history of AoD. Only 23.0% of screening studies were of the chest only. There were 29 acute AoDs diagnosed (14 type A and 15 type B) making for a prevalence of 2.5%. Only one patient with an acute AoD detected on a chest-only CTA required farther imaging, which did not delay clinical care. No patients ruled-out for acute AoD with a chest-only CTA had a return ED visit or repeat CTA within 6 months diagnosing a missed AoD. There were no AoDs limited to the abdominal aorta that would have been missed on a chest-only study. In patients in the ED with suspected new acute AoD, a CTA limited to the chest can effectively evaluate the condition without delaying care in this integrated healthcare system with 24/7 CT availability."

    "abstract": "Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) became the standard of care for treating Type B aortic dissections and descending thoracic aortic aneurysms. We aimed to describe the racial/ethnic differences in TEVAR utilization and outcomes. The National Inpatient Sample was reviewed for all TEVARs performed between 2010 and 2017 for Type B aortic dissection and descending thoracic aortic aneurysm (DTAA). We compared groups stratifying by their racial/ethnicity background in White, Black, Hispanic, and others. Mixed-effects logistic regression was performed to assess the relationship between race/ethnicity and the primary outcome, in-hospital mortality. A total of 25,260 admissions for TEVAR during 2010-2017 were identified. Of those, 52.74% (n = 13,322) were performed for aneurysm and 47.2% (n = 11,938) were performed for Type B dissection. 68.1% were White, 19.6% were Black, 5.7% Hispanic, and 6.5% were classified as others. White patients were the oldest (median age 71 years; p < .001), with TEVAR being performed electively more often for aortic aneurysm (58.8% vs. 34% vs. 48.3% vs. 48.2%; p < .001). In contrast, TEVAR was more likely urgent or emergent for Type B dissection in Black patients (65.6% vs. 41.1% vs. 51.6% vs. 51.7%; p < .001). Finally, the Black population showed a relative increase in the incidence rate of TEVAR over time. The adjusted multivariable model showed that race/ethnicity was not associated with in-hospital mortality. Although there is a differential distribution of thoracic indication and comorbidities between race/ethnicity in TEVAR, racial disparities do not appear to be associated with in-hospital mortality after adjusting for covariates."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection is rare but life-threatening. The symptoms depend on the localization and reduced perfusion of the downstream organs or limbs and are therefore variable. Neurological symptoms may occur that do not immediately lead to a diagnosis and thus delay the necessary therapy. Knowing the early symptoms and warning signs of aortic dissection is therefore also crucial in neurological emergency care for quickly identifying the affected patients and for providing acute therapy. A misdiagnosis with delayed initiation of therapy can significantly worsen the patient's outcome. This study aims to establish a standardized diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for suspected acute aortic dissection in neurological emergency care. Close interdisciplinary cooperation is mandatory. Eine akute Aortendissektion ist selten, aber lebensbedrohlich. Die Symptome hängen von der Lokalisation und Minderperfusion der nachgeschalteten Organe oder Extremitäten ab und sind dementsprechend variabel. Es können neurologische Symptome auftreten, die nicht unmittelbar zur Diagnosestellung führen und so die notwendige Therapie verzögern. Die Kenntnis der Frühsymptome und Warnsignale einer Aortendissektion sind deswegen auch in der neurologischen Notfallversorgung wichtig, um die Betroffenen schnell zu identifizieren und der Akuttherapie zuzuführen. Eine Fehldiagnose mit verzögerter Therapieeinleitung kann die Prognose der Patienten deutlich verschlechtern. Ziel dieser Arbeit ist es, einen standardisierten Diagnostik- und Therapiealgorithmus bei Verdacht auf eine akute Aortendissektion in der neurologischen Notfallversorgung zu etablieren.

    "abstract": "Pulmonary hemorrhage is a life-threatening complication of cardiovascular surgery. Bronchial artery hypertrophy, a rare pathology associated with inflammatory and ischemic respiratory diseases, increases the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage; however, its involvement in cardiovascular surgery is not well known. We present two cardiovascular surgical cases in which embolization of the hypertrophied bronchial artery was effective in controlling perioperative pulmonary hemorrhage. The first case was a 51-year-old man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who developed acute type A aortic dissection. After emergent surgery, his blood pressure suddenly dropped in the intensive care unit; computed tomography revealed a right hemothorax. Because a 4-mm dilated bronchial artery was identified on preoperative computed tomography, the hemothorax was suspected to be associated with bronchial artery hypertrophy. Selective bronchial arteriography was emergently performed and revealed a right pulmonary parenchymal blush. After subsequent coil embolization of the bronchial artery, the parenchymal blush disappeared, and his hemodynamic condition stabilized. The second case was a 66-year-old man with bronchiectasis who was referred for redo aortic valve replacement due to structural valve deterioration. A bioprosthesis was previously implanted to avoid permanent anticoagulation because the patient had repeated episodes of hemoptysis; however, he still had persistent hemosputum during admission for the redo aortic valve replacement. A dilated bronchial artery 3.7 mm in size was incidentally identified on preoperative computed tomography, and hence, the repeated hemosputum was suspected to be associated with bronchial artery hypertrophy. Bronchial arteriography revealed a right pulmonary parenchymal blush, and prophylactic embolization of the bronchial artery was performed. The hemosputum disappeared after the procedure, and redo aortic valve replacement was performed uneventfully 8 days later. In cardiovascular surgery, the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage associated with bronchial artery hypertrophy should be considered, especially in patients with inflammatory and ischemic respiratory diseases."

Herein, we report a case of a 74-year-old man with end-stage renal disease who was presented with high-concentration pleural effusion owing to residual contrast medium. The case required differentiation from hemothorax owing to an aortic dissection and its rupture. In patients with end-stage renal disease, noncontrast-enhanced computed tomography after contrast-enhanced computed tomography may result in high-concentration pleural effusion owing to the existence of residual contrast medium. This realization is important to determine whether high-concentration pleural effusion symptoms reflect an urgent hemothorax case possibly related to an imminent rupture of an aortic aneurysm or intrathoracic penetration of aortic dissection, and whether invasive procedures, such as thoracentesis, ought to be avoided."

    "abstract": "Pseudoaneurysm with a shunt to the right ventricle after aortic repair for acute aortic dissection is an extremely rare and life-threatening condition. Surgical treatment is unavoidable, but surgery is complicated, and there are some pitfalls. This study describes the reoperation performed in a patient at a high surgical risk by clarifying the shunt site using multimodality imaging before surgery. A 69-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjogren's syndrome presented with a pseudoaneurysm 1 year after emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection. Eight years after the first surgery, she experienced sudden chest pain and presented to the emergency department. Her dyspnea worsened; therefore, echocardiography and three-dimensional computed tomography (3DCT) were performed, and a pseudoaneurysm and shunt to the right ventricle were identified. The medical team attempted to close the shunt with a percutaneous catheter but was unsuccessful, and she was referred to our department for surgical treatment. The pseudoaneurysm originating from the proximal side of the aorta was large (diameter = 55 mm), and echocardiography-gated 3DCT identified the shunt from the pseudoaneurysm to the right ventricle. First, extracorporeal circulation was initiated, and resternotomy was performed. We could not insert the left ventricular venting tube from the right side because of the pseudoaneurysm size. Instead, the tube was inserted from the left atrial appendage. We found a half-circumferential disengaged anastomosis around the proximal anastomosis, which formed the large pseudoaneurysm leading to a fistula in the right ventricle. We closed the fistula and performed a Bentall operation. The patient had a good postoperative course and was discharged on postoperative day 21. She continued treatment for SLE and Sjogren's syndrome, and her inflammatory reaction improved. We performed a Bentall operation and fistula closure with resternotomy in a patient with type A aortic dissection with SLE and Sjogren's syndrome. Multimodal imaging is essential in defining the pseudoaneurysm and the fistula surrounding the anatomy while ensuring their resolution and guiding the approach for operation."

    "title": "Theoretical Feasibility of Using Arch Branched Endograft Devices for Repair of Post Type A Aortic Dissection in Patients With Prior Ascending Aortic Replacement.",
    "abstract": "Ascending aortic replacement is a common emergency procedure for treating acute type A aortic dissection. Secondary open or endovascular interventions for residual arch pathologies is difficult because of adhesions, short prosthetic grafts, and distorted anatomies. Aortic arch branched stent grafts have emerged as a potential solution for these patients if they have suitable anatomical conditions. This study aimed to evaluate the theoretical anatomical and technical feasibility of 2 currently used aortic arch branch endografts in patients who had prior replacement of the ascending aorta. All patients who had a prosthetic ascending aortic or hemiarch replacement for acute type A dissection in a single institution between January 2013 and December 2018 were included. Contrast computed tomography images on the most recent follow-up were analyzed on a 3-dimensional workstation. Morphological parameters were measured individually for the ascending aorta, aortic arch, supra-aortic branches, and access iliac arteries. The computed tomography scan of each patient was individually evaluated for anatomical suitability for the arch branched and double-branch devices according to set selection criteria. Computed tomography images of 56 patients (median age of 57 years, 45 males) were reviewed. Based on our evaluation, 26 patients (46.4%) were good candidates for an endovascular arch branched device. It would be feasible for 13 patients (23.2%), but prudent preoperative planning was required due to complicated anatomy. The other 17 patients (30.4%) were unsuitable because they met at least 1 exclusion criterion. Short prosthetic grafts, extreme graft angulations, and extensive dissections in the supra-aortic branches were the main reasons for exclusion. Endovascular repair using arch branched endografts is feasible in patients with prior ascending aortic arch or hemiarch replacement for acute type A aortic dissection. The most common anatomical conditions that may influence the feasibility of the arch branched endograft procedure include insufficient proximal seal length, severe angulation of the graft, and extensive aortic dissection within the supra-aortic vessels."

These most commonly include Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection. Open surgical repair represents the standard approach in this specific group of patients. Extensive aortic replacements are generally performed in order to reduce long-term complications caused by the progressive dilatation of the remnant aortic segments. In the last decades, endovascular interventions have emerged as a valid alternative in patients affected by degenerative TAAA. However, in patients with CTD, this approach presents higher rates of reinterventions and postoperative complications with a disputable long-term durability, and it is nowadays performed for very selective indications such as severe comorbidities and urgent/emergent settings. Despite a deeper knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in CTD, improvements in medical therapy, and a multidisciplinary approach fully involved in the management of these usually frailer patients, this specific group still represents a challenge.

Acute cannabis smoking has been associated with increased risk for myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke in otherwise healthy young people. However, it remains uncertain if people who exclusively smoke cannabis have increased risk for accelerated atherosclerosis similar to that found in people who exclusively smoke tobacco cigarettes. Cocaine and methamphetamines, both stimulants, increase risk for stroke, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, and accelerated atherosclerosis, but only methamphetamine use is strongly linked to pulmonary hypertension. Chronic alcohol use is strongly associated with chronic hypertension and hemorrhagic stroke, but perhaps confers a lower risk for myocardial infarction. Finally, anabolic steroid use, presumably through adverse effects on circulating lipids and the hematopoietic system, is associated with increased risk for accelerated atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. Physicians, especially cardiologists, emergency medicine, and internal medicine physicians, should be familiar with the short- and long-term vascular consequences of use of these substances, thereby ensuring appropriate, specific, and informed counselling and treatment."

Patients undergoing TEVAR were consecutively included from 1999 to 2019. Thoracic aortic disease includes thoracic aortic aneurysms, aortic dissection, traumatic rupture, penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU), and intramural hematoma (IMH). Our prospective database recorded baseline characteristics, endoleak or aneurysm growth, and death. Patients were included at the time of treatment and censored at death or first reintervention depending on the analysis. Primary end point was all-cause death; secondary end point was reintervention. Survival and failure analyses were done using STATA IC 16.0 and truncated at 15 years of follow-up. Two hundred and fifty six patients were included and 63% were men. Their mean age at intervention was 66.2 ± 14.5 years and they were followed for a mean of 5.2 ± 4.5 years. Indications for TEVAR were acute aortic syndrome in 40.6%, chronic aortic disease in 44.5%, and traumatic rupture in 14.8%. Technical success was seen in 94.1% of the operations, and the left subclavian artery was covered in 27.7%. A 30-day mortality rate was 21.2% (22/104) and 1.75% (2/114) (P < 0.001) for urgent and elective patients, respectively. Twelve patients (4.7%) died within 24 hr of treatment. Overall, long-term mortality recorded 112 (43.8%) deaths, 29 patients had reinterventions (11.3 %, 95% confidence interval: 7.7-15.9), and aneurysms accounted for 62.1% of all reinterventions. Twenty four (82.8%) reinterventions occurred within the first 5 years. This long-term follow-up study shows excess mortality in patients treated for acute aortic syndrome compared to chronic aortic disease, within the first 30 days; this difference diminishes at the end of follow-up. Most endoleaks occur within the first 5 years, although new endoleaks continue to develop decades after in previous endoleak-free patients calling for lifelong surveillance."

    "abstract": "This oral boards case is appropriate for emergency medicine residents and medical students on emergency medicine rotations. Third-degree heart block (also known as complete heart block) is a cardiovascular emergency that requires prompt recognition. Complete heart block is a type of atrioventricular (AV) block whereby no atrial impulses reach the ventricular conduction system. The most common etiology of AV block is ischemic heart disease, with up to 1 in 5 patients developing some type of conduction disturbance after an MI.1 Complete heart block is seen in 8% of patients post-MI.2 Other causes include myocarditis, infectious endocarditis, infiltrative cardiac disease, congenital AV blocks, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, electrolyte disturbances, and drug side effects.3 In complete heart block, the heart rate is dependent on the location of the block and a functioning secondary pacemaker within the conduction system. Analysis of the EKG will determine the location of this escape rhythm. For escape rhythms originating at the AV node or high in the His-Purkinje system, the QRS complex will typically be narrow, and the ventricular rate typically in the 40-60 bpm range. For blocks with ventricular escape rhythms, the QRS will appear wide, with rates of 20-40 bpm. Patients presenting with 3rd-degree AVB with ventricular escape rhythms can destabilize. If no escape rhythm generates, patients develop asystole and cardiac arrest. Since 1 in 600 adults over the age of 65 will develop a form of supraventricular conduction abnormality each year, this disease process is important to identify and treat.4 Effective management includes accurate interpretation of a 12-lead EKG, assessment of hemodynamic stability and systemic perfusion, and time-sensitive pharmacologic or procedural intervention. At the end of this oral board session, examinees will: 1) demonstrate ability to obtain a complete medical history including detailed cardiac history, 2) demonstrate the ability to perform a detailed physical examination in a patient with cardiac complaints, 3) investigate the broad differential diagnoses which include acute coronary syndrome (ACS), electrolyte imbalances, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident, aortic dissection and arrhythmias, 4) obtain and interpret the cardiac monitor rhythm strip to identify complete heart block, 5) list the appropriate laboratory and imaging studies to differentiate arrhythmia from other diagnoses (complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, magnesium level, EKG, troponin level, chest radiograph), 6) identify a patient with complete heart block and manage appropriately (administer IV atropine, attempt transcutaneous pacing, place a transvenous pacemaker, emergent consultation with interventional cardiology), 7) provide appropriate disposition to intensive care after consultation with interventional cardiologist. This is a straight-forward case which was written to assess learners' ability to rapidly recognize an unstable cardiac rhythm and to subsequently treat and stabilize the patient. Oral board testing is used as a proxy for the emergency department (ED) and can assist with periodic assessment of resident performance while in the ED.We have found that oral board testing is a useful tool to assess residents' critical thinking while still applying pressure that is needed to pass the examination itself. Large groups of residents can be assessed in a short time period without needing to \"wait\" for a particular clinical condition to present to the ED.In this case, learners were assessed using a free online evaluation tool, ie, Google forms. Multiple questions were written for each critical action, and the Google form served as the online evaluation and repository. The critical actions of the case were then tied to Emergency Medicine Milestones, and the results were compiled for use during residency clinical competency evaluations. Residents were provided with immediate verbal feedback of their performance and were also given their electronic evaluations when requested. Learners and instructors were given the opportunity to provide electronic feedback after the case was completed to assess strengths and weaknesses, and subsequent modifications were made. Additionally, learners answered written multiple-choice questions after the case to assess for retention of the material. Senior learners found this to be a more enjoyable way to refresh their skills than direct lecture. Junior residents and students who encountered this clinical entity first in the oral board rather than in the ED, stated that they enjoyed the ability to \"trial run\" the case before being faced with an emergent and uncontrolled setting of the ED. Overall, the learners rated the case as 4.7 (1-5 Likert scale, 5 being excellent) after the mock oral board examination was completed. Students and residents who were assessed with a mock oral board session found this to be an improvement over traditional \"lecture\" and were pleased to have participated. The content is highly relevant to emergency medicine and the format forces learners to be actively engaged in review of the material. The case is a good model for the high stakes testing of written and oral board examinations, and is an effective way to assess a resident's ability to rapidly assess and manage a life-threatening condition in the ED.

    "abstract": "Acute aortic syndrome (AAS) comprises a triad of life-threatening aortic conditions that are difficult to diagnose because of their non-specific clinical presentations. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography aortography (CTA) has a high sensitivity and specificity for these conditions. However, under- and over-investigation of patients with suspected AAS using CTA carries significant risk. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic imaging practices of CTA use for patients presenting to an ED with suspected AAS. All atraumatic thoracic CTAs performed on patients aged ≥15 years old with suspected AAS who presented to Auckland City Hospital between 2009 and 2019 were included. Outcomes of interest were the annual ED and population incidences of AAS, and the rate of CTAs performed. A total of 1646 CTAs were included. There were 135 (8.2%) cases of at least one AAS diagnosis and 220 (13.4%) cases where an alternative diagnosis was made. The population-adjusted number of AAS diagnoses remained relatively stable over the study period, with a mean annual AAS incidence of 19.6 (95% confidence interval 9.9-33.7) per 100 000 patients, and 3.2 (95% confidence interval 1.6-5.4) per 100 000 population. The number of ED presentations increased during the study period, along with the population-adjusted rate of CTAs performed, from approximately 150 per 100 000 patients (2009) to 350 per 100 000 patients (2019). Thoracic CTA use for investigating suspected AAS in our ED has recently increased. However, the annual incidence of AAS did not increase over the same period, but was higher than reported in overseas institutions."

Most cases occur during the third trimester of pregnancy, Herein, we describe a case of a pregnant woman with acute type A aortic dissection at 28 weeks of gestation. A previously healthy, 24-year-old gravida 2 para 1 woman was brought to the emergency department during at the 28 weeks of gestation and diagnosed with acute type A aortic dissection. Cesarean section was performed with the cardiac surgical team on standby for cardiopulmonary bypass and the patient delivered a baby weighing 1000 g. After the operation, we performed the Beatall procedure and total arch replacement with FET using the deep hypothermic circulatory arrest technique. Both the mother and child survived and recovered well. A review of the literature on antepartum acute aortic dissection during pregnancy is also presented. Women should have a comprehensive, systematic physical examination before getting pregnant. Women at high risks of aortic dissection must undergo multidisciplinary evaluation and be counseled before pregnancy, once they become pregnant, their consistent aortic root diameter should be consistently monitored, and their blood pressure strictly controlled."

    "abstract": "The present study evaluated the efficacy of C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer and the combination of them as prognostic indicators for patients with acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD). This is a retrospective cohort study. From January 2019 to December 2021, patients with ATAAD admitted to the emergency medicine center of our hospital within 24 h after symptoms (chest pain, back pain, abdominal pain and so on) onset were enrolled in our study. Serum concentration of CRP and D-dimer were measured during hospitalization. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between these two biomarkers and in-hospital adverse outcomes (IAO) by adjusting confounding factors. Predictive efficacy was assessed by area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic curve. A total of 199 patients with ATAAD were finally enrolled. They were categorized as Non-IAO group (n = 146) and IAO group (n = 53) according to postoperative outcomes. After controlling for potentially confounding variables, we found categorized variables that admission CRP > 54.28 mg/L, admission D-dimer > 8.45 mg/L and peak D-dimer > 24.89 mg/L were independent predictors of in-hospital adverse outcomes. Multiple Logistic regression analysis revealed that the odd ratios were 2.9 for admission D-dimer > 8.45 [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.11-7.5, p = 0.03], 4.9 for admission CRP > 54.28 (95% CI 1.6-14.9, p = 0.005) and 5.7 for peak D-dimer > 24.89 (95% CI 2.49-13, p < 0.001). The predictive accuracy of the combination of three categorized variables (AUC: 0.867, 95% CI 0.813-0.921, p < 0.001) was superior to that of any other one alone. Admission D-dimer > 8.45 mg/L, peak D-dimer > 24.89 mg/L and admission CRP > 54.28 mg/L are independent predictors of in-hospital adverse outcomes in patients with ATAAD. Combination of these three markers will improve the predictive efficacy."

Emergency total arch graft replacement (TAR) was performed through a median sternotomy on the same day. Immediately following TAR, the patient experienced hypoxemia. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was diagnosed following TAR for acute aortic dissection with pneumonia. Nitric oxide inhalation (NOI) therapy was commenced at 20 ppm from the fourth day post-surgery. However, 6 d following TAR, he developed bilateral pneumothorax due to ruptured bullae requiring chest tube management and thoracoscopic left upper lobe bullectomy. Eight days following TAR, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO) was initiated and NOI therapy was completed. V-V ECMO was withdrawn 18 d after TAR.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on global surgery. In particular, deleterious effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the heart and cardiovascular system have been described. To inform surgical patients, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis aiming to characterize outcomes of COVID-19 positive patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021228533) and conformed with PRISMA 2020 and MOOSE guidelines. PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE and Web of Science were searched between 1 January 2019 to 24 February 2022 for studies reporting outcomes on COVID-19 positive patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Study screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted in duplicate. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model where at least two studies had sufficient data for that variable. Searches identified 4223 articles of which 18 studies were included with a total 44 patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Within these studies, 12 (66.7%) reported populations undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, three (16.7%) aortic valve replacements (AVR) and three (16.7%) aortic dissection repairs. Overall mean postoperative length of ICU stay was 3.39 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.38, 6.39) and mean postoperative length of hospital stay was 17.88 (95% CI: 14.57, 21.19). This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated studies of limited quality which characterized cardiac surgery in COVID-19 positive patients and demonstrates that these patients have poor outcomes. Further issues to be explored are effects of COVID-19 on decision-making in cardiac surgery, and effects of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system at a cellular level."

We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of Impella (Abiomed, Danvers, MA, USA) as a bridge to cardiac surgery in patients with cardiogenic shock. We reviewed 7 patients with cardiogenic shock who underwent Impella support as a bridge to cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass at our institution between April 2018 and August 2021. Cardiogenic shock was caused by ventricular septal rupture in 3 patients, papillary muscle rupture in 1 and acute myocardial infarction in 3. Cardiac surgery was delayed by 1-7 (3.9 ± 2.5) days with Impella support after the diagnosis of cardiogenic shock, during which the hepatic and renal function of the patients improved significantly. Device-related or operation-related adverse events included re-exploration for bleeding in 3 patients, acute limb ischaemia due to thromboembolism in 1 and intraoperative aortic dissection in 1. Thirty-day mortality was 14.3%, and the cumulative survival was 71.4% at 1 year. The survival tended to be better than that in historical control group in which extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used as a bridge to surgery (P = 0.0992). Impella is an effective tool for bridging patients with cardiogenic shock to surgery. This strategy may improve surgical outcomes in patients with cardiogenic shock. However, prolonged Impella support may increase significant adverse events, and further investigation is required to determine the optimal duration of support before surgery."

    "abstract": "A left ventricular pseudoaneurysm is a rare but life-threatening complication after myocardial infarction. Because untreated pseudoaneurysms have a 30%-45% risk of rupture, surgery is the preferred therapeutic option. However, its diagnosis is sometimes challenging, as a pseudoaneurysm presents with non-specific symptoms that can mimic myocardial infarction or heart failure. We report a male patient with a history of aortic dissection surgery who presented with recurrent chest pain probably due to acute coronary syndrome. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a cavity at the apex of the left ventricle, indicating a mechanical complication after myocardial infarction. As the coronary angiography was considered difficult because of the patient's anatomical problem, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) was performed. CT angiography revealed multiple nodular cavities continued from within the left ventricle. It seemed that the pseudoaneurysm was formed in stages in the adherent pericardium after myocardial infarction, resulting in a bead-like appearance. Emergent pseudoaneurysmectomy and left ventricular wall repair were performed, and the patient was discharged without any complications. This case illustrates the utility of cardiac CT to establish the diagnosis of left ventricular pseudoaneurysm and coronary artery atherosclerosis."

ATAAD patients diagnosed and treated with emergency surgery in our hospital from June 2017 to December 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with postoperative hypoxemia were divided into the iNO group and control group. Propensity score matching was used to analyze clinical characteristics and results of the two groups. A total of 218 ATAAD patients with BMI ≥ 25 were treated with surgery. Among them, 115 patients developed refractory hypoxemia (64 in the control group and 51 in the iNO group). Patients in the iNO group had significantly shorter invasive mechanical ventilation time, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and hospital stay. After 6 h of iNO treatment, the PaO2/FiO2 ratio in the iNO group increased significantly, and this ratio was higher than that in the control group at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment. Low-dose iNO could improve oxygenation and shorten mechanical ventilation and ICU stay in patients with hypoxemia after ATAAD surgery, but without significant side effects or increase in postoperative mortality or morbidity. These findings provide a basis for a randomized multicenter controlled trial to assess the efficacy of iNO in the treatment of hypoxemia after ATAAD surgery."

Forty-five double-chimney for the left subclavian artery (LSA) and left common carotid artery LCCA and 165 single-chimney for the LSA were performed in chimney-TEVAR (c-TEVAR) and 69 branched-TEVAR (b-TEVAR) with 36 single-branched stent-grafts and 33 branched stent-grafts combined with fenestration technique. The c-TEVAR group experienced more in-hospital complications than the b-TEVAR group (19.5 vs. 7.2%, p = 0.017), primarily because the c-TEVAR group experienced more in-hospital cerebral ischemia events (6.2 vs. 0%, p = 0.043) and intra-operative type I endoleaks (31.9 vs. 5.8%, p < 0.01). There were significantly more follow-up type I endoleaks (21.9 vs. 4.3%, p = 0.002), cerebral ischemia events (11.0 vs. 2.9%, p = 0.042), and re-interventions (12.9 vs. 4.3%, p = 0.048) in the c-TEVAR group than in the b-TEVAR group. However, follow-up mortality was not significantly different between the c-TEVAR and b-TEVAR groups (5.2 vs. 2.9%, p = 0.638). In patients with aortic pathologies involving the arch branches, customized b-TEVAR may result in fewer cerebral ischemia events and endoleaks than c-TEVAR.

No significant difference of age, preoperative hemodynamics, organ ischemia conditions, operative variables as well as the 30-Day mortality and in-hospital complications was discovered between two groups. However, the survival rates and the proportion of late aortic event (sudden death and reoperation) free population at 1 and 3 years after surgery were significantly decreased in dialysis patients compared to non-dialysis patients. Our study indicated that the short-term surgical outcomes of ATAAD in dialysis patients were comparable to non-dialysis patient.

Although the definite treatment for an acute-type AD is considered to be open-heart surgery, the decision to perform such a surgery during pregnancy requires a multidisciplinary approach and carries significant risks. In the present review of the literature, we have discussed various challenges in the management of acute-type AD during pregnancy, including therapeutic approaches, choosing the preferred imaging modalities, surgical techniques, and medication challenges. We have also reported an 8-week pregnant woman with Marfan syndrome who presented with chest pain and was diagnosed with acute AD. The patient underwent a Bentall operation and was discharged in good condition with her fetus alive. The medical team's various decisions during preoperative, operative, and postoperative treatments were discussed. Type A AD is considered infrequent in the second and third trimester of pregnancy and rare in the first trimester. Performing a CMR study without contrast in stable patients can help evaluate the extension of the flap. Urgent surgery in the hands of a skilled surgeon may prove lifesaving for the mother while maximizing the likelihood of preserving the fetus."

Emergency surgery was performed by one of a few teams of experienced surgeons, regardless of the time of day. Patients were divided into two groups based on the surgery start time: during working hours (n = 65) and after hours (n = 122). A propensity score-matched analysis was performed for 58 pairs of patients. The overall in-hospital mortality was 6.9% for the working-hours group and 13.8% for the after-hours group. There were no significant differences between the groups in the relatively limited study population (n = 187). Surgeon experience and aortic interventions did not differ remarkably between the groups. After-hours repair was not associated with postoperative complications. There were no significant differences in the long-term survival or aortic event-free rates between the groups. After-hours surgery did not affect the short- or long-term outcomes of ATAAD repair under our backup system, which supports the recommendation of immediate surgical repair. Efforts to minimize the discrepancies between working hours and after hours could help to improve the surgical outcomes of patients undergoing ATAAD repair."

However, the efficiency of PUS for extensive arch repair of acute type A aortic dissection (AAAD) in older adult patients has not been well investigated. Between January 2014 and December 2019, 222 older adult patients (≥ 65 years) diagnosed with AAAD went through extensive arch repair, among which 127 received PUS, and 95 underwent full sternotomy (FS). Logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for early death, and negative binomial regression analysis was applied to explore risk factors related to post-operative ventilator-supporting time and intensive care unit stay time. Total early mortality was 8.1% (18/222 patients). The PUS group had shorter Cardiopulmonary bypass time (133.0 vs.155.0 min, P < 0.001), cross-clamp time (44.0 vs. 61.0 min, P < 0.001) and shorter selective cerebral perfusion time (11.0 vs. 21.0 min, P < 0.001) than the FS group. Left ventricle ejection fraction  < 50% (odds ratio [OR] 17.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.87-155.63; P = 0.012) and malperfusion syndromes (OR 65.83; 95% CI 11.53-375.86; P < 0.001) were related to early death. In the multivariate model, the PUS approach contributed to shorter ventilator-supporting time (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.76; 95% CI 0.64-0.91; P = 0.003), when compared with the FS group.

Although most resolve spontaneously or with conservative therapy, several cases of AIH may complicate into classic aortic dissection with subsequent risk of aortic rupture and visceral malperfusion, thus needing urgent or preemptive thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR). Despite the long-term aorta-related survival, TEVAR might lead to graft obstruction, migration, infection, stroke/paraplegia, visceral ischemia, endoleak and, last but not least, retrograde aortic dissection (AD), frequent in the acute phase and associated with a high mortality risk. In order to highlight such a close relationship between AIH and AD and the possibility to perform endovascular treatment, we report the experience of an adult female patient with an aortic intramural haematoma evolving into a classic aortic dissection. Despite successful thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR), our patient developed an aortic dissection type A at one month with subsequent indication for cardiac surgery still representing the elective approach in case of pathologies including the ascending aorta. Thus, the aim of our discussion is to create a debate on the most appropriate management for the treatment of descending AIH."

This study included nine patients suffering from severe multiple injuries accompanied by Stanford type B TAD, with injury severity scores ranging from 35 to 43 points. Six patients underwent EVGE while receiving emergency treatment, whereas two patients who also had intracranial haemorrhage underwent selective EVGE. One case of TAD missed in the emergency department was detected 13 days after hospitalisation; therefore, the patient promptly underwent EVGE. Emergency procedures performed included exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy (n = 2), thoracic closed drainage (n = 5), haemothoracotomy (n = 3), second-stage fracture surgery (n = 4), and tracheotomy (n = 1). Postinjury complications included haemorrhagic shock, coagulation disorders, hyoxaemia, pulmonary infection, renal insufficiency, and hypoproteinaemia; however, all patients recovered after intensive care treatment. Aortic CTA after EVGE revealed the disappearance of the dissection and the resorption of the intermural haematoma. However, varying degrees of stenosis or occlusion were observed in the left subclavian artery. Nine patients with severe multiple injuries were treated satisfactorily by the MDT, without fatalities, and all patients were discharged for rehabilitation. In this study, procedures including resuscitation, urgent aortic CTA for definitive diagnosis, prompt EVGE, emergency injury control surgery, second-stage definitive surgery, intensive care treatment, and rehabilitation were rationally performed by the emergency MDT trauma team. Overall, this continuous and seamless process is a key factor for the successful treatment of patients with severe multiple injuries accompanied by TAD."

    "abstract": "The clinical data on postoperative mortality and central nervous system (CNS) complications in older adults who underwent acute type A aortic dissection are limited. Thus, in this study we aimed to evaluate the association between age and early postoperative mortality and occurrence of CNS complications. This multicentric retrospective cohort study included 5 tertiary hospitals in Japan. All patients who underwent emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection between October 1998 and December 2019 were enrolled. The multilevel Cox proportional hazards model, which considered years as level 1, institutions as level 2, and surgeons as level 3, was used to evaluate the association between age and early postoperative hospital mortality and occurrence of CNS complications. Of the 1037 patients, 227 (21.9%) were ≥80 years old and 810 (78.1%) were <80 years old. Overall, 134 patients (12.9%) died within 30 days postoperatively; among them, 42/227 (18.5%) and 92/810 (11.4%) were aged ≥80 and <80 years, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 1.63; P = .0046). CNS complications within 30 days postoperatively occurred in 140/1037 (13.5%) patients; among them, 42/227 (18.5%) and 98/810 (12.1%) were aged ≥80 and <80 years, respectively (HR, 1.63; P = .011). In multivariate analysis, age ≥80 years was associated with mortality within 30 days postoperatively (adjusted HR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.23-4.57; P = .01) but not with CNS complications (adjusted HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 0.93-2.69; P = .091). The early postoperative mortality in older patients was approximately 50% higher than in the younger population. A thorough discussion regarding the surgical indications should be done."

    "abstract": "Oral anticoagulation prior to emergency surgery is associated with an increased risk of perioperative bleeding, especially when this therapy cannot be discontinued or reversed in time. The goal of this study was to analyse the impact of different oral anticoagulants on the outcome of patients who underwent emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD). This was a single-centre retrospective study of patients treated with oral anticoagulation at the time of surgery for ATAAD. Outcomes of patients on new oral anticoagulant (NOAC) therapy were compared to respective outcomes of patients on Coumadin. Additionally, a survival analysis was performed comparing these 2 groups with patients who were operated on with no prior anticoagulation. Between January 2013 and April 2020, a total of 437 patients (63.8 ± 11.8 years, 68.4% male) received emergency surgery for ATAAD; 35 (8%) were taking oral anticoagulation at the time of hospital admission: 20 received phenprocoumon; 14, rivaroxaban; and 1, dabigatran. Compared to Coumadin, NOAC was associated with a greater need for blood-product transfusions and haemodynamic compromise. Operative mortality was 53% in the NOAC group and 30% in the Coumadin group. A 5-year survival analysis showed no significant difference between the NOAC and the Coumadin group (P = 0.059). Compared to 402 patients treated during the study period without anticoagulation, patients taking NOAC had significantly worse survival (P = 0.001), whereas that effect was not observed in patients undergoing surgery who were taking Coumadin (P = 0.99). Emergency surgery for ATAAD in patients taking NOAC is associated with high morbidity and mortality. NOAC are a major risk factor for uncontrollable bleeding and haemodynamic compromise. New treatment strategies must be defined to improve surgical outcomes in these high-risk patients."

    "title": "The David Operation Offers Shorter Hemostasis Time Than the Bentall in Case of Acute Aortic Dissection Type A.",
    "abstract": "Background The aim of the present study was to compare the clinical outcome of the David operation and the Bentall operation in patients with Stanford type A acute aortic dissection (AADA) from the viewpoint of hemostasis. Methods Between April 2016 and April 2020, 235 patients underwent emergent surgery for AADA. Of them, 38 patients required aortic root replacement (ARR: The David operation 17, the Bentall operation 21). The mean age was 59.3±12.6 years. In the present series, the David operation was the first choice for relatively young people, and the Bentall operation was performed for relatively elderly patients and cases in which valve-sparing seemed impossible. Results Between the David and the Bentall group, the 30-day mortality rate did not differ significantly. However, hemostasis time (144.6±50.3 vs. 212.5±138.1 min, p=0.047), defined as the interval from the cessation of cardio-pulmonary bypass (CPB) to the end of the operation, and total operation time (477.8±85.7 vs. 578.3±173.6 min, p=0.027) were significantly shorter in the David group than in the Bentall group, and the amount of blood transfusion was less in the David group than in the Bentall group (red blood cells: 3.5±3.6 vs. 9.2±5.9 units, p=0.013; fresh frozen plasma: 4.1±4.7 vs 9.4±5.1 units, p=0.002; platelet concentrate: 33.2±11.3 vs 42.2±12.0 units, p=0.025). Conclusion David operation offers a shorter hemostasis time and consequently shorter operation time than the Bentall operation in the setting of AADA, probably due to double suture lines, despite its surgical complexity."

    "abstract": "Masquerade presentation of acute type B aortic dissections (TBAD) as acute limb ischaemia (ALI) is rare. Holistic clinical assessment, preferably with the help of scoring systems and timely computer tomographic angiogram (CTA), is needed for early diagnosis. Acute TBAD and its complications are increasingly treated with endovascular therapies. A 21-year-old male with poorly controlled essential hypertension was admitted with prominent clinical features of ALI. No clinical pointers of a TBAD were present. Doppler ultrasound revealed an arterial occlusive pattern, and an urgent surgical embolectomy was performed. On failure to retrieve any thrombi, a CTA was performed, and diagnosis of TBAD complicated with ALI was made. The limb was revascularised with guidewire directed aortic fenestration with angioplasty. TBAD was managed conservatively. We report a case of acute TBAD presented as isolated ALI, which was initially diagnosed and treated as an ALI unrelated to aortic dissection. TBAD with typical or atypical clinical features presented with ALI as a malperfusion syndrome is not uncommon. However, masquerade presentations of TBAD as ALI are rare in the literature. Endovascular fenestration with or without stenting has fewer neurological complications and long-term mortality than thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). Moreover, they become convenient in resource-poor settings without dedicated aortic centres. Masquerade presentation of TBAD should be recognised in the differential diagnosis of ALI. Timely CTA would prevent unnecessary interventions and help diagnose TBAD complicated with ALI. Despite their availability, outcomes will depend on proper patient selection for endovascular, surgical, and TEVAR options."

    "abstract": "The ever-changing landscape of aortic arch surgery necessitates a constant update on the available devices and technologies for the contemporary management of complex aortic diseases. The E-Vita OPEN NEO hybrid stent graft system offers a unique approach for aortic arch replacement with the frozen elephant trunk technique. In contrast to its predecessors and other commercially available devices, it fits to each individual patient's needs by allowing for more proximal graft anastomosis. We sought to present our initial experience with the novel E-Vita OPEN NEO hybrid stent graft system focusing on its description, optimal graft selection, operative technique, and results in a clinical setting. We prospectively collected data on all patients in whom the E-Vita OPEN NEO device was used between October 2020 and May 2021. The primary outcome was perioperative or with 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were the incidence of neurologic complications (stroke and spinal cord ischemia) and endoleak on a postoperative computed tomography angiography. During the study period, six patients received the novel hybrid stent device. The mean patient age was 59.3 ± 13.3 years and 83% were male. Two patients were operated on an emergent setting due to acute Stanford type A aortic dissection and there were two reoperations in patients with a history of previous repaired type A dissection. There was no perioperative or 30-day mortality and none of the patients exhibited adverse neurologic events. Two patients required completion thoracic endovascular repair due to type Ib endoleak. One patient died after a prolonged stay in the intensive care unit due to pneumonia and multiorgan failure. This novel device adapts to each patient's characteristics and offers a curative option for acute and chronic aortic arch and descending aortic conditions such as aneurysmal disease and aortic dissection. In addition, it offers an excellent landing station for potential endovascular therapies and allows for complete aortic remodeling."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a fatal disease demanding prompt diagnosis and proper treatment. There is a lack of serum markers that can effectively assist diagnosis and predict prognosis of AAD patients. Ninety-six AAD patients were enrolled in this study, and 249 patients with chest pain due to acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, intramural hematoma, angina or other causes and 80 healthy controls were included as control group and healthy control group. Demographics, biochemical and hematological data and risk factors were recorded as baseline characteristics. The 1-year follow-up data were collected and analyzed. The diagnostic performance and ability to predict disease severity and prognosis of NET components in serum and aortic tissue were evaluated. Circulating NET markers, citH3 (citrullination of histone 3), cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and nucleosomes, had good diagnostic value for AAD, with superior diagnostic performance to D-dimer in discriminating patients with chest pain due to other reasons in the emergency department. Circulating NET marker levels (i.e., citH3, cfDNA and nucleosomes) of AAD patients were significantly higher than that of control group and healthy control group. In addition, circulating NET markers levels were closely associated with the disease severity, in-hospital death and 1-year survival of AAD patients. Systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg and serum citH3 levels were identified as independent risk factors for 1-year survival of AAD patients. Excessive NET components (i.e., neutrophil elastase and citH3) in the aortic tissue of AAD patient were significantly higher than that of healthy donor aortic tissue. The expression levels of granules and nuclear NET components were significantly higher in aortic tissue from AAD patients than controls. Circulating NET markers, citH3, cfDNA and nucleosomes, have significant diagnostic value and predictive value of disease severity and prognosis of AAD patients. The NETs components may constitute a useful diagnostic and prognostic marker in AAD patients."

    "abstract": "Aortic arch repair has undergone constant evolution since its inception with improving outcomes. A sizeable number of competing techniques and strategies have been described, with no single optimal method endorsed by the surgical community. We describe our experience with open aortic arch repair in a high-volume center. We queried our aortic database for consecutive patients undergoing aortic arch repair from 1997-2021. Those undergoing hemiarch repair were compared to those undergoing total arch repair. Outcomes were compared using multivariate analysis. Of 1308 patients undergoing aortic arch repair, 953 underwent hemiarch repair and 355 underwent total arch repair. The median age was 69 (interquartile ratio 58-76) and 61.7% were men. Hemiarch patients more frequently hade aortic dissection (28.5 vs. 11.8%, P<0.001) and urgent or emergent procedure status (45.1 vs. 30.4%, P<0.001). Overall operative mortality was 2.7% and significantly higher in the hemiarch group (3.5 vs. 0.6%, P=0.007). No difference in the incidence of major adverse events (MAE) including myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, new need for dialysis, re-exploration for bleeding, and tracheostomy was found between the two groups. Multivariate analysis found diabetes, urgent or emergent procedure status, preoperative renal dysfunction, New York Heart Association class III/IV symptoms, and connective tissue disease to be independent predictors of MAE. Retrograde cerebral perfusion with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest is safe and effective, with no appreciable difference in neurologic outcomes when comparing hemiarch to total arch strategies. Rates of mortality and MAE compare favorably with strategies utilizing antegrade cerebral perfusion."

    "title": "Learning Curve of Aortic Arch Replacement Surgery in Chinese Mainland with Stanford Type A Aortic Dissection.",
    "abstract": "Stanford type A aortic dissection (TAAD) is the most common cause of death caused by aortic disease in the Chinese mainland. Patients suffering TAAD need immediate surgical treatment [Pompilio 2001; Di Eusanio 2003; Ueda 2003; Li 2013; Afifi 2016; Zhou 2019; Zhou 2021]. Emergency aortic arch replacement is difficult and risky. The prognosis following surgery varies depending on the different surgical approaches [Pompilio 2001; Kazui 2002; Di Eusanio 2003; Ueda 2003; Moon 2009; Li 2013; Afifi 2016; Zhou 2019; Zhou 2021]. Aortic arch replacement includes total-arch replacement (Sun's operation) and hemi-arch replacement. The comparative analysis of learning curves between the two procedures has not been systematically studied. In this study, we studied and analyzed the learning curves of total-arch replacement and hemi-arch replacement using cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis. From January 2013 to December 2019, a total of 139 Stanford TAAD operations were performed by the same surgeon and two assistants, including 61 cases of hemi-arch replacement and 78 cases of total-arch replacement. Baseline information, including preoperative conditions, intraoperative related data and postoperative prognosis, were collected. Descriptive statistics and CUSUM were used to analyze the total operation time, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time, aortic clamping (AC) time, operative mortality, incidence of postoperative complications, postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) time, hospital stay, and postoperative drainage volume. A total of 139 patients with TAAD (age 48.8 ± 12.3, male, 107, female, 32) underwent emergency aortic arch replacement. A total of 61 patients (43.9%) underwent hemi-arch replacement, and 78 patients (56.1%) underwent total-arch replacement. The total time, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time, and aortic clamping (AC) time of hemi-arch operation were 434.2 ± 137.0 minutes, 243.3 ± 87.2 minutes, and 157.0 ± 60.2 minutes. The total, CPB, and AC times of total-arch operation were 747.8 ± 164.3 minutes, 476.4 ± 121.6 minutes, and 238.5 ± 67.6 minutes. The mortality of hemi-arch operation was 3.3%, and that of total-arch operation was 6.4%. The incidence of complications after hemi-arch operation was 11.3%, and that after total-arch operation was 46.2%. The ICU time and hospital stay after hemi-arch surgery were 7.3 ± 4.4 days and 27.2 ± 16.2 days, respectively, and the ICU time and total hospital stay after total-arch surgery were 7.2 ± 5.9 days and 24.0 ± 10.3 days, respectively. The total drainage volume after hemi-arch operation was 2182.4 ± 1236.4 ml, and that after total-arch operation was 2467.3 ± 1385.7 ml. According to CUSUM analysis, the same cardiovascular surgery team seems to have different learning curves in the time of two operations. CUSUM analysis of intraoperative and postoperative indicators shows that after a certain period of professional and systematic cardiovascular surgery training, aortic hemi-arch replacement has the characteristics of short learning cycle and easy to master for surgeons, while total-arch replacement requires a longer learning cycle. Although the emergency operation of TAAD is difficult and risky, according to results the of CUSUM analysis, cardiovascular surgeons can achieve better learning results in hemi-arch replacement than total-arch replacement."

The overall 30-day mortality rate was 8.5% in septuagenarians and 9.4% in octogenarians (p = 1.0). The hospital mortality rate was 10.2% in septuagenarians and 12.5% in octogenarians (p = 0.74). Multivariate analysis identified prolonged ventilation (≥ 72 h) as a significant risk factor for hospital mortality. Being an octogenarian was not significantly associated with hospital mortality.

    "abstract": "Stanford type A acute aortic dissection is an inherently lethal condition that is regarded as a surgical emergency. The Bentall procedure is considered the gold standard for patients requiring aortic root replacement. However, this method can be technically difficult for less-experienced surgeons. Complications encountered after composite graft replacement include distortion of the proximal part of the coronary artery, bleeding from the conduit implant site, and reattached coronary artery origins caused in general by a consumption coagulopathy. In cases for which aortic valve preservation is not applicable and the root is not dissected or dilated, surgeons often opt for less complicated techniques like aortic valve and supracoronary ascending aortic replacement. Nevertheless, these patients carry a high risk of late aortic root dilatation and subsequent reoperation. The goal of aortic root reinforcement by the Florida sleeve technique is to encase the aortic root to prevent any further dilatation and perioperative bleeding."

To evaluate preoperative condition, symptoms might be subjective and objective evaluation of cerebral artery has not yet been established. For quantitative evaluation, this study focused on brain computed tomography perfusion (CTP), which has been recommended by several guidelines of acute ischaemic stroke. In the last 2 years, 147 patients hospitalized due to acute type A aortic dissection were retrospectively reviewed. Among the 23 (16%) patients with cerebral malperfusion, 14 who underwent brain CTP (6 preoperative and 8 postoperative) were enrolled. CTP parameters, including regional blood flow and time to maximum, were automatically computed using RApid processing of Perfusion and Diffusion software. The median duration from the onset to hospital arrival was 129 (31-659) min. Among the 6 patients who underwent preoperative CTP, 4 with salvageable ischaemic lesion (penumbra: 8-735 ml) without massive irreversible ischaemic lesion (ischaemic core: 0-31 ml) achieved acceptable neurological outcomes after emergency aortic replacement regardless of preoperative neurological severity. In contrast, 2 patients with an ischaemic core of >50 ml (73, 51 ml) fell into a vegetative state or neurological death due to intracranial haemorrhage. CTP parameters guided postoperative blood pressure augmentation without additional supra-aortic vessel intervention in the 8 patients who underwent postoperative CTP, among whom 6 achieved normal neurological function regardless of common carotid true lumen stenosis severity. CTP was able to detect irreversible ischaemic core, guide critical decisions in preoperative patients and aid in determining the blood pressure augmentation for postoperative management focusing on residual brain ischaemia."

    "abstract": "Various kinds of surgical strategies and prostheses have been advocated to improve short-term and long-term outcomes in type A aortic dissection (TAAD). Large-scale repair of the pathological aorta is hard to generalize due to complex procedures. We aimed to investigate the performance, effectiveness and safety of a novel Sutureless Integrated Stented (SIS) graft prosthesis in TAAD patients undergoing total arch replacement (TAR) and frozen elephant trunk (FET) implantation surgery. All patients admitted to Fuwai Hospital were prospectively screened. Urgent or scheduled surgery was arranged for eligible patients. The primary endpoint was operative mortality. Key secondary endpoints included stroke, spinal cord injury, unexpected aortic reoperation, and 1-year survival. Discharged patients were followed up with computed tomography angiography and transthoracic echocardiography at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery. Performance, effectiveness and safety analyses were performed in those patients. Between August 1 and September 3, 2020, ten TAAD patients were enrolled in this study and successfully implanted with the SIS graft prosthesis. The median (IQR) age was 56.50 (43.75, 66.75) years (range from 31 to 75), and seven patients were male (70.0%). All patients underwent ascending aorta replacement + TAR + FET and additional procedures when necessary. The median (IQR) operation time, cardiopulmonary bypass time and cross clamp time were 270.50 (218.50, 312.50), 110.00 (88.00, 125.75), 69.50 (51.25, 82.75) min, respectively. Of note, the median (IQR) circulatory arrest time was 9.00 (8.00, 9.00) min (range from 4 to 12). The median (IQR) lowest nasopharyngeal temperature was 26.75 (25.98, 27.67) °C. Follow-up was 100% completed. During the 1-year follow-up, no patients died, no severe adverse events occurred, and rate of freedom from aortic reintervention was 100%. The SIS graft prosthesis was implanted in a novel sutureless way, which simplified the surgical procedure, shortened the circulatory arrest time and avoided deep hypothermia. The preliminary clinical outcomes and follow-up outcomes demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of this prosthesis. A large-scale trial is being conducted to further assess these findings."

The proximal landing zones were: zone 1 (n = 1, 1%), zone 2 (n = 23, 27%), zone 3 (n = 52, 61%) and zone 4 (n = 9, 11%). Temporary spinal cord injury occurred in 1 patient (1%), permanent spinal cord injury in 7 patients (8%). Two patients (2%) experienced a postoperative stroke. Seventeen patients (20%) expired in-hospital. Aortic dissection (odds ratio: 16.246, p = 0.001), aneurysm (odds ratio: 9.090, P = 0.003) and preoperative shock (odds ratio: 4.646, P < 0.001) were predictive for mortality. Eighteen patients (21%) required a stent-graft-related aortic reintervention for symptomatic supra-aortic malperfusion (n = 3, 4%), endoleaks (n = 6, 7%), a second aortic rupture (n = 4, 5%), retrograde type A aortic dissection (n = 2, 2%), aortic-oesophageal fistulation (n = 2, 2%) and stent-graft kinking (n = 1, 1%). Thoracic endovascular aortic repair in patients with aortic rupture has become a valuable treatment modality to stabilize patients. However, a significant risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality remains, particularly in patients with aortic dissections, aneurysms or shock. Patients require thorough follow-up ideally in an aortic clinic with a staff having the entire spectrum of cardiovascular and thoracic surgical expertise."

    "abstract": "A 10-year-old girl presented with a chief complaint of cyclic vomiting since the last 12 h and chest pain since the last 6 h. She was diagnosed with Stanford type A aortic dissection. Intraoperatively, the aortic valve was found to be bi-lobed, and infective endocarditis associated with aortic valve perforation and rupture of the aortic sinus aneurysm, was also observed. Therefore, she underwent aortic valve replacement due to an enlarged aortic root and aortic sinus repair. The perioperative recovery was good. A large amount of bloody pericardial effusion was found in this child pre-operatively. Therefore, early surgical intervention was necessary. Acute aortic dissection rarely occurs in children. There are no clinical guidelines for the management of pediatric aortic dissection. However, if a large pericardial effusion exists, emergency surgery is necessary and effective. The treatment of the valve should be based on the actual situation. It is best to give priority to valve molding, although valve replacement is required in the majority of cases for infective endocarditis."

An 82-year-old man was taken to another hospital with severe intermittent dizziness. Head magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple right-hemispheric cerebral infarctions. Computed tomography also showed a \"missing flap,\" indicating that the intimal flap was observed in the aortic root and arch but not in the ascending aorta. The patient was referred to our hospital for emergent surgery. Intraoperatively, the intimal tear was found to be circumferential, and the transected intima was folded and superimposed from the origin of the brachiocephalic artery to the aortic arch.

    "abstract": "Type A aortic dissection (TAAD) is a life-threatening clinical emergency requiring timely surgical intervention. If untreated, 50% of TAAD die within the first 24 h, with mortality increasing by 1%-2% every passing hour within the first 48 h of presentation. Surgical repair of TAAD is a major procedure associated with relatively high mortality and morbidity postoperatively. Several inflammatory biomarker have been linked to aortic dissection (AD) as diagnostic and/or prognostic tools, one example is the monocyte count to high-density lipoprotein ratio (MHR). This commentary aims to discuss the recent study by Savas et al. which investigated the use of MHR as a predictive biomarker for in-hospital mortality following surgery for TAAD. We carried out a literature search on multiple electronic databases including PUBMED and Scopus to collate research evidence to assess the value of MHR as a prognostic biomarker in AD. Savas et al. proved that MHR is an effective predictive biomarker for in-hospital mortality following surgical repair of TAAD by demonstrating that MHR was independently associated with in-hospital mortality in this subset of patients. Despite the advancement in surgical and perfusion techniques, surgical management of TAAD remains associated with relatively high risk of mortality and morbidity. Using prognostic biomarkers such as MHR can provide a means of reducing in-hospital mortality by identifying those at risk. Yet, further research into this area is encouraged."

Included were patients who presented between January 2001 and February 2020 with a non-A non-B aortic dissection involving the aortic arch but not the ascending aorta and with the most proximal entry tear located within the aortic arch between the innominate and left subclavian artery. Clinical data and operative details were retrieved from medical histories and surgical protocols. Preoperative, postoperative and follow-up computed tomography angiography scans were analysed. We analysed a total of 39 patients [median age 62 (52; 67) years, men 76.9%] with non-A non-B arch entry aortic dissections type. They underwent 15 thoracic endovascular aortic repairs, 20 frozen elephant trunk implantations, 1 hybrid arch replacement, or 1 conventional arch replacement. Two patients were managed conservatively. Twelve (31%) patients underwent emergent intervention, 12 (31%) were treated invasively within 2 weeks. Another 2 (5%) and 9 (23%) patients were treated 2 and 4 weeks after dissection occurred, respectively. Six (15%) patients presented with an impending aortic rupture, while 19 (49%) had at least one malperfused organ. Four patients (27%) died after thoracic endovascular aortic repair; the 30-day mortality following frozen elephant trunk was 0%. Non-A non-B acute aortic dissection reveals a frequently complicated course requiring emergency intervention. The majority of patients required aortic arch repair within the first 2 weeks. Total arch replacement with the frozen elephant trunk technique seems to be low procedural mortality, and may become the treatment of choice in arch entry non-A non-B aortic dissection."

Between March 2013 and December 2019, 115 patients underwent emergency frozen elephant trunk for acute dissection. Patients without root replacement were assigned to group A, while patients with concomitant full root replacement to group B. Mean age was 50.8 (12.5) years and 85 (73.9%) patients were male. Preoperative malperfusion was present in 49 (42.6%) patients. In group B, 27 (41.5%) patients received composite root replacement and 38 (33.0%) aortic valve-sparing David procedure. Cardiopulmonary-bypass and cross-clamp times were 252.5 (208.5-293.0) and 96.0 (40.5-148.0) min in group A, and 310.0 (274.0-346.5) and 121.0 (89.0-182.0) in group B (P < 0.001). Continuous myocardial perfusion was used in 40 (80.0%) patients of group A and 59 (90.8%) of group B (P = 0.098). Disabling stroke was present in 10 (20.0%) patients in group A and 12 (18.5%) in group B (P = 0.835). Thirty-day mortality was 12.0% (n = 6) in group A and 9.2% (n = 6) in group B (P = 0.630). The 1- and 5-year survival rates were 80% and 62% in group A, and 81% and 79% in group B.

Full root replacement does not increase the perioperative risk in patients who undergo frozen elephant trunk for acute dissection. Careful patient selection is important for such complex procedures. Continuous myocardial perfusion can help reducing the risk for intraoperative complications during such complex operations."

Various ultrasonographic techniques have been evaluated as ways to determine the cause of stroke; among them, carotid artery ultrasonography is particularly useful since it provides considerable information within a short time period when used to evaluate a specific site. In the emergency room, carotid artery ultrasonography can be used to diagnose internal carotid artery stenosis, predict an occluded vessel, and infer the cause of ischemic stroke. Additionally, carotid artery ultrasonography can diagnose different conditions including subclavian artery steal syndrome, bow hunter's stroke, Takayasu's arteritis, moyamoya disease, and dural arteriovenous fistula. Furthermore, patients with ischemic stroke with a pulse deficit or hypotension must be differentiated from acute type A aortic dissection, which requires emergency surgery; carotid artery ultrasonography can immediately differentiate between the two conditions by identifying the intimal flap of the common carotid artery. The following article provides an overview of carotid artery ultrasonography performed as point-of-care ultrasound in the emergency room in patients with suspected stroke."

A total of 54 patients were retrospectively analyzed between 23 March and 22 May 2020, who were diagnosed to have aortic dissection, coronary artery disease, and heart valve diseases. Thirty-two CABG, 12 valve surgery, 6 aortic surgery, 4 CABG + valve surgeries were performed. During the postoperative follow-up of 11 patients, who were suspicious of COVID-19, 8 of them displayed respiratory problems and partial oxygen depletion and required continuous positive airway pressure. The hospitalization duration of COVID-19-suspicious patients were approximately 5 days longer than that of normal patients. In one of the patient, who was treated positive for COVID-19, acute coronary syndrome developed and CABG was performed following the treatment. During the pandemic period, acute cardiac diseases needing urgent surgery could be misdiagnosed because of similar symptoms with COVID-19 and the health care practitioners concentrated with the COVID-19 primarily. On the other hand, pandemic fear could cause delayed admission to the hospital and increased postoperative mortality and morbidity. When a COVID-19-positive or -suspicious patient undergo open-heart surgery, problems resulting from both COVID-19 infection and cardiopulmonary bypass-associated systemic effects could arise. The combination of these two cases could worsen the complications."

Thus, rapid diagnosis of TAD in the emergency department would get patients to the right treatments to save their lives. Methods: We profiled the proteome of aortic tissues from TAD patients using a label-free quantification proteomics method. The differentially expressed proteins were screened and subjected to bioinformatics analysis. Candidate biomarkers were selected and validated in independent serum samples using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The diagnostic values were further predicted via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: A total of 1,141 differentially expressed proteins were identified in aortic tissues from 17 TAD patients and eight myocardial infarction (MI) patients. Six proteins were selected as candidate biomarkers for ELISAs in an independent training set of 20 serum samples (TAD = 10, MI = 10). Of these proteins, four with a P-value < 0.01 were further validated in another independent set of 64 serum samples (TAD = 32, MI = 32) via ELISAs. ITGA2, COL2A1, and MIF had P-values < 0.0001, and their areas under the curve (AUCs) were 0.801 (95% CI: 0.691-0.911), 0.773 (95% CI: 0.660-0.887), and 0.701 (95% CI: 0.574-0.828), respectively. Conclusion: ITGA2, COL2A1, and MIF were identified as promising biomarkers for discriminating TAD from emergency patients with severe chest pain. Biomarker-guided emergency triage could further shorten the time for patients to get more effective treatments."

Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a biomarker related to coagulation cascade and cardiovascular-injury. The extent of LPA elevation in AAD and whether it can discriminate sudden-onset of acute chest pain are currently unclear. Methods: We measured the plasma concentration of LPA in a cohort of 174 patients with suspected AAD chest pain and 30 healthy participants. Measures to discriminate AAD from other acute-onset thoracalgia were compared and calculated. Results: LPA was significantly higher in AAD than in the AMI, PE, and the healthy (344.69 ± 59.99 vs. 286.79 ± 43.01 vs. 286.61 ± 43.32 vs. 96.08 ± 11.93, P < 0.01) within 48 h of symptom onset. LPA level peaked at 12 h after symptom onset, then gradually decreased from 12 to 48 h in AAD. LPA had an AUC of 0.85 (0.80-0.90), diagnosis threshold of 298.98 mg/dl, a sensitivity of 0.81, specificity of 0.77, and the negative predictive value of 0.85. The ROC curve of LPA is better than D-dimer (P = 0.041, Delong test). The decision curve showed that LPA had excellent standardized net benefits. Conclusion: LPA showed superior overall diagnostic performance to D-dimer in early AAD diagnosis may be a potential biomarker, but additional studies are needed to determine the rapid and cost-effective diagnostic tests in the emergency department."

The left internal thoracic artery (LITA) graft anastomosed to the left descending artery was not affected by the aortic dissection, and during the ascending aortic replacement, the artery was not identified for clamping. Although fully sufficient cardioplegia was not achieved due to the patent LITA graft, the patient's postoperative cardiac function was good. The two anastomotic sites of the vein grafts to the ascending aorta were excised along with a remnant of the aortic wall in an island fashion and were reimplanted onto the artificial graft. Based on the site of intimal tear, we speculated that partial clamping during the previous surgery had caused the dissection."

Diseases of the intimomedial layers (aortic dissection and variants) have been grouped under the common term of acute aortic syndrome because they are life-threatening conditions clinically indistinguishable on presentation. Patients with aortic dissection may present with a wide variety of symptoms secondary to the pattern of dissection and end organ malperfusion. Other conditions may be seen in patients with acute symptoms, including ruptured and unstable thoracic aortic aneurysm, iatrogenic or infective pseudoaneurysms, aortic fistula, acute aortic thrombus/occlusive disease, and vasculitis. Imaging plays a pivotal role in the patient's management and care. In the emergency room, chest X-ray is the initial imaging test offering a screening evaluation for alternative common differential diagnoses and a preliminary assessment of the mediastinal dimensions. State-of-the-art multidetector computed tomography angiography (CTA) provides a widely available, rapid, replicable, noninvasive diagnostic imaging with sensitivity approaching 100%. It is an impressive tool in decision-making process with a deep impact on treatment including endovascular or open surgical or conservative treatment. Radiologists must be familiar with the spectrum of these entities to help triage patients appropriately and efficiently.

The COVID-19 vaccination frequently leads to minor adverse reactions, which may be more intense after the second dose. The number of case reports of myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination have been recently increased. We report a case of a 26-year-old healthy man who presented to our hospital with chest pain on 24 May 2021, 4 days after his second COVID-19 vaccination. The electrocardiogram showed ST elevation with upward concavity in I, II, aVL, aVF, V4 to V6, and small Q wave in II, III, aVF. Laboratory studies revealed elevation of troponin I, creatine kinase, C-reactive protein, and negative viral serologies. Acute aortic dissection and pulmonary thromboembolism were ruled out by contrast-enhanced thoracoabdominal computed tomography. An urgent coronary angiogram was performed because an acute coronary syndrome was suspected, but no significant stenosis was found. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated oedema and late gadolinium enhancement of the left ventricle in a mid-myocardial and epicardial distribution. Although the temporal association does not prove causation, the very short span between the second vaccination and the onset of myocarditis suggests that this acute myocarditis seemed to be an adverse reaction to COVID-19 vaccine. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published case of acute myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccine in Asia."

A knowledge gap exists regarding the role that health maintenance plays in the development and outcomes of type B aortic dissection (TBAD). In the present study, we evaluated the comparative presentation and short-term outcomes of patients with TBAD across race. In the present single-center, retrospective study, TBAD patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit from 2015 to 2020 were identified. Patients who had self-identified as Black (n = 57) or White (n = 123) were included. The demographics, socioeconomic status, and pre-event health maintenance were compared between the two groups. Socioeconomic disadvantage was quantified using the area deprivation index (ADI). Management strategies included nonoperative and surgical repair. The outcomes assessed included 30-day mortality, hospital length of stay, and the APACHE II (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) score. The present study included 180 consecutive patients with TBAD. TBAD included complicated (n = 42) and uncomplicated (n = 138) cases, of which 79 had had high-risk features. Black patients were younger than were White patients (58.9 vs 67.6 years; P < .01) and were more likely to have end-stage renal disease (8.8% vs 0.8%; P = .01) and to present with anemia (10.5% vs 2.4%; P = .03). The TBAD anatomic features and management were similar in both groups. The rate of surgical intervention during hospitalization was 40% and 46% for the Black and White patients, respectively (P = .4). Black patients were more likely to be taking three or more hypertension agents (42.2% vs 16.4%; P = .005) and were less likely to be adherent to taking the prescribed agents (27.1% vs 6.7%; P < .001). Also, Black patients had fewer primary care physician visits before TBAD (P = .03) and more emergency department usage before TBAD (57.9% vs 26.9%; P < .001). Black patients had also had higher ADI scores (86.0 ± 14.6 vs 64.4 ± 21.3; P < .001). The median APACHE II score was the same for both Black and White patients (9 [interquartile range (IQR), 6-12] and 9 [IQR, 7-13], respectively; P = .7). The median hospital length of stay was identical for both groups (7 days; IQR, 5-13 days). The readmission rate was 24.5% for Black patients vs 15.5% for White patients (P = .16), with the 30-day mortality similar between the two groups (Black, 7.0%; White, 5.7%; P = .7). Black patients had presented at a younger age but with similar dissection morphology, rate of anatomic high-risk features, and APACHE II scores. The fewer primary care physician visits, greater emergency department usage, and higher ADI scores suggested lower health maintenance for the Black patients. White patients with TBAD were also highly deprived of health maintenance compared with the national percentile, indicating that TBAD is a disease that affects vulnerable populations, regardless of race."

Medical records of patients who underwent open, total arch replacement surgery at Siriraj Hospital from 2006 to December 2019 were reviewed. Demographic data, clinical factors, preoperative status, intraoperative data, and postoperative data were analyzed. A total of 330 patients were included and 36 (10.9%) died in the hospital. More than one concomitant operation (odds ratio (OR) 5.16, p < 0.001) and emergency operation (OR 3.45, p = 0.003) were risk factors for in-hospital mortality.

Participants with TAA or aortic dissection (TAD) and trileaflet aortic valve were enrolled from 2016 to 2019 in the setting of cardiothoracic surgical care. Data were ascertained by structured interviews with participants. The mean age among 241 cases was 61 ± 13 years. Eighty (33%) had history of TAD. While most participants lacked a formal syndromic diagnosis clinically, connective tissue abnormalities were identified in 113 (47%). This included 20% with abdominal hernia and 13% with skin striae in atypical location. In multivariate analysis, striae and hypertension were significantly associated with TAD. Striae were associated with younger age of TAD or prophylactic aortic surgery. Striae were more frequent in TAD cases than age- and sex-matched controls. Thus, systemic features of connective tissue dysfunction were prevalent in adults with aortopathy. The emerging nexus between striae and aortopathy severity creates opportunities for clinical stratification and basic research."

    "abstract": "To analyze the results of hemoadsorption in patients with cardiac surgery to thoracic aortic surgery, who had been loaded beforehand with either Factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban or P2Y12 receptor antagonist ticagrelor. We investigated 21 of 171 consecutive patients (median age 71 [interquartile range 62, 76] years) who underwent emergency cardiac operations for acute type A aortic dissection between 2014 and 2020. These patients were pretreated with rivaroxaban (n = 9) or ticagrelor (n = 12). In ten of 21 cases (since 2017), we installed a hemoadsorber into the heart-lung machine and compared the results to eleven patients done without hemoadsorber before that time. The operation time was significantly shorter in the adsorber group (286 ± 40 min vs. 348 ± 79 min; p = 0.045). The postoperative 24-hour drainage volume was significantly lower after adsorption (p <0.001; 482 ± 122 ml vs. 907 ± 427 ml) and no rethoracotomy had to be performed (compared to two rethoracotomies [18.9%] among patients without adsorber use). Also, patients without hemoadsorption required significantly more platelet transfusions (p = 0.049). In patients with acute type A aortic dissection who were pretreated with rivaroxaban and ticagrelor, the intraoperative use of CytoSorb hemoadsorption during cardiopulmonary bypass is reported for the first time. The method was found to be effective to prevent from bleeding and to improve the outcome in aortic dissection."

A 55-year-old woman developed hemolytic anemia after emergency ascending aortic replacement for acute type A aortic dissection. Although computed tomographic angiography or doppler echocardiography could not identify the culprit stenotic legion, 4D flow MRI revealed jet flow and highly elevated TKE at the highly stenosed proximal anastomosis of a replaced ascending aorta. Our findings suggest that 4D flow MRI evaluation and TKE estimation enable more accurate and detailed assessment of abnormal flow dynamics than conventional imaging modalities."

Although the development of ulcer-like projection (ULP) is associated with an increase in adverse aorta-related events, the false-lumen enlargement caused by the ULP progression is uncommon. A 72-year-old female with chronic TBAD was admitted to our unit with back and chest pain. Computed tomography revealed acute type A aortic dissection and a hematoma caused by rupturing of the descending aorta due to chronic TBAD. After endovascular intervention, the false lumen thrombosed and shrunk. After 9 months, a developing ULP, which projected into a dilating false lumen, was found. An impending ruptured descending aortic aneurysm was confirmed. Emergency Total arch replacement and thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) was performed. The procedure was successful. One year later, regular follow-up showed that the false lumen had completely shrunk. ULP can arise and cause progressive dilation of false lumen after TEVAR. Careful and regular computed tomography examinations are required for early diagnosis of false lumen becoming thrombosed after TEVAR. Close follow-up and timely intervention, including TEVAR, should be considered in cases of aortic enlargement due to a newly developed ULP."

We seek to evaluate the impact of DAPT on bleeding-related events and early- and mid-term mortality after total arch replacement and frozen elephant trunk in such patients. This study comprised 48 ATAAD patients on preoperative DAPT and 418 without DAPT (the whole series, i.e. unmatched cohort), from which 45 matched pairs were selected by propensity score (matched cohort). Bleeding-related events (reoperation for bleeding, bleeding of ≥1500 ml within the first 12 h postoperatively or transfusion of ≥10 units of red blood cell or use of recombinant activated factor VII), operative mortality and mid-term survival were compared in the unmatched and matched cohorts. The impact of preoperative DAPT was evaluated with multivariable analysis. In the unmatched cohort, bleeding of ≥1500 ml/12 h postoperatively was more common in the DAPT group (18.8% vs 8.4%, P = 0.020); operative mortality was 9.7%, which did not differ with DAPT (12.5% vs 9.3%, P = 0.48). Nor did bleeding-related events (54.2% vs 43.5%, P = 0.16) differ significantly between 2 groups. In the matched cohort, neither were drainage of ≥1500 ml/12 h (20% vs 6.7%, P = 0.063) and bleeding-related events (53.3% vs 42.2%, P = 0.30), nor operative mortality (13.8 vs 8.9%, P = 0.50) and mid-term survival (79.3% vs 76.4%, P = 0.93) significantly different between 2 groups. DAPT was not identified as a predictor for operative mortality [odd ratio (OR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31-3.08; P = 0.96; adjusted OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.22-7.20; P = 0.78] and bleeding-related events (OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.76-2.95; P = 0.24; adjusted OR 2.03, 95% CI 0.80-3.66; P = 0.14). In patients with ATAAD undergoing total arch replacement and frozen elephant trunk, although preoperative DAPT led to more postoperative bleeding, it did not increase bleeding-related events nor operative mortality nor mid-term death. The results of this study imply that for patients with ATAAD, emergency surgical repair, even if as extensive as total arch repair, should not be contraindicated or delayed simply because of ongoing DAPT."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a rare but severe condition, routinely treated with emergent cardiac surgery. Many surgeons have the notion that patients with ATAAD tend to come in clusters, but no studies have examined these observations. This investigation was undertaken to study the potential association between the lunar cycle and the incidence of ATAAD. We collected information on 2995 patients who underwent ATAAD surgery at centres from the Nordic Consortium for Acute Type A Aortic Dissection collaboration. We cross-referenced the time of surgery with lunar phase using a case-crossover design with 2 different definitions of full moon (>99% illumination and the 7-day full moon period). The period when the moon was illuminated the most (99% definition) did not show any significant increase in incidence for ATAAD surgery. However, when the full moon period was compared with all other moon phases, it yielded a relative risk of 1.08 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.17, P = 0.057] and, compared to waxing moon, only the relative risk was 1.11 (95% CI 1.01-1.23, P = 0.027). The peak incidence came 4-6 days after the moon was fully illuminated. This study found an overrepresentation of surgery for ATAAD during the full moon phase. The explanation for this is not known, but we speculate that sleep deprivation during full moon leads to a temporary increase in blood pressure, which in turn could trigger rupture of the aortic wall. While this finding is interesting, it needs to be corroborated and the clinical implications are debateable."

    "abstract": "Emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection (AAAD) was usually avoided or denied in octogenarians because of high surgical mortality. Refined surgical techniques and improved postoperative care have led to an improved in-hospital outcome. However, a significant number of operative survivors suffered from postoperative complications and had compromised quality of life. We sought to assess the clinical outcome of emergency surgery using a standard conservative approach in octogenarians with AAAD. From 2004 to 2021, 123 patients underwent emergency surgery for AAAD by one surgeon using a standard conservative approach with right subclavian artery cannulation, no aortic cross-clamp, selective antegrade cerebral perfusion, moderate systemic hypothermia, reinforced sandwich technique, and a strategy of limited aortic resection. Hospital and late outcomes were assessed in patients with age >80 years. Eighteen patients (15%) were octogenarians with seven males (39%) and median age of 82 years (range, 80-89). Hypertension was present in six patients (33%). None had diabetes mellitus, Marfan, or bicuspid aortic valve. Dissection was intramural hematoma in six (33%) and DeBakey type I in 15 patients (83%). Cardiac tamponade with shock was present in seven patients (39%). Ascending aortic grafting was performed in 17 patients, and additional hemiarch replacement in one patient. The hospital mortality rate was 17% (3/18). Fourteen patients (82%) were alive and well at discharge.

The effect of corticosteroids on aortic annular complications has not been directly assessed in this population. A retrospective analysis of 1095 patients undergoing transfemoral TAVR was performed. Patients treated with chronic steroids at the time of the procedure (n = 99) were compared with those who received no steroids (n = 992). The primary outcome included a composite of aortic annular complications, defined as a combination of aortic annular rupture, aortic dissection/perforation, and left ventricular perforation. The primary outcome was significantly higher in the steroid group (4.0% vs 0.5%; P<.01). This finding was primarily driven by higher rates of acute annular rupture in the steroid group (2.0% vs 0.2%; P=.04). Steroid use was associated with higher rates of intraoperative cardiac arrest (5.1% vs 1.5%; P=.03), device capture/retrieval (4.0% vs 0.8%; P=.01), and emergent conversion to open heart surgery (4.0% vs 0.6%; P<.01). There were no differences with respect to in-hospital mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, need for permanent pacemaker, bleeding complications, minor vascular complications, hospital length of stay, hospital 30-day readmission, or 30-day echocardiographic findings. Additionally, within the steroid group, there were no significant differences between balloon-expandable vs self-expanding TAVR prostheses with respect to composite aortic annular complications. Chronic steroid therapy increases the risk of aortic annular complications in patients undergoing TAVR, with detrimental consequences including intraoperative cardiac arrest and conversion to open heart surgery. Steroid use should be considered in patient selection and determination of procedural technique for TAVR."

A 63-year-old man was referred for sudden right-side weakness accompanied by a decreased level of consciousness for almost 1 hour and 37 minutes. He had a history of hypertension. His skin was clammy, and on physical examination, there was involuntary chest thumping in the left upper limb. Hyperacute cerebral infarction was considered after no bleeding was observed on emergency head computed tomography, and intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase was administered immediately after. The patient was then taken to the catheter room, ready for endovascular thrombectomy. Stanford type A AD was found by cerebral angiography before endovascular thrombectomy. The infusion of alteplase was stopped immediately during cerebral angiography, but the patient's blood pressure, heart rate, and blood oxygen were still declining progressively, and the degree of consciousness disturbance deepened. The patient died after the combined but failed rescue attempts of multiple departments. Hyperacute ischemic stroke caused by AD often hides some telltale signs. Clinicians should master basic clinical skills to exclude AD by looking for these telltale signs hidden in hyperacute ischemic stroke to avoid the fatal consequences of intravenous thrombolysis and/or cerebral angiography within the narrow window of time."

In this prospective study conducted from January 2000 to December 2013, participants with an aortic dissection with a patent false lumen and no comorbidities underwent CTA during the subacute phase. Participants were followed up for a survival analysis to assess the time to an adverse aortic event (AAE). The maximum aortic diameter (MAD), proximal and distal tear areas and difference between these areas, and partial false-lumen thrombosis were assessed by using Cox regression for adverse events. Seventy-two participants (mean age, 55 years ± 12 [standard deviation]; 55 men) were evaluated: 47 were surgically treated (type A aortic dissection) and 25 were medically treated (type B aortic dissection). Twenty-two participants had an AAE manifest during follow-up (9.22 years ± 5.78): There were 18 elective surgeries for aneurysmal degeneration, two emergent surgeries for acute aortic syndrome, and two aortic condition-related deaths. A categorical model composed of genetic aortic disease (GAD) (hazard ratio [HR], 3.4 [95% CI: 1.2, 9.9]; P = .02), MAD greater than 45 mm (HR, 6.1 [95% CI: 2.4, 15.8]; P < .001), and tear dominance (HR, 5.2 [95% CI: 2.1, 13]; P < .001), defined as an absolute tear area difference of greater than 1.2 cm2, was used to stratify participants into three risk groups: low, without any risk factors (57% [41 of 72] and 7% [three of 41] had events); intermediate, with one risk factor (31% [22 of 72] and 50% [11 of 22] had events); and high, with two or more risk factors (13% [nine of 72] and 89% [eight of nine] had events; log rank P < .001).

The majority of aneurysm cases remains asymptomatic until a sudden rupture which is usually fatal and of extremely high mortality (~ 50-60%). Therefore, early diagnosis, prevention and management of aneurysm are in urgent need. Unfortunately, current understanding of disease driver genes of various aneurysm subtypes is still limited, and without appropriate biomarkers and drug targets no specialized drug has been developed for aneurysm treatment. In this research, aneurysm subtypes were analyzed based on protein-protein interaction network to better understand aneurysm pathogenesis. By measuring network-based proximity of aneurysm subtypes, we identified a relevant closest relationship between aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection. An improved random walk method was performed to prioritize candidate driver genes of each aneurysm subtype. Thereafter, transcriptomes of 6 human aneurysm subtypes were collected and differential expression genes were identified to further filter potential driver genes. Functional enrichment of above driver genes indicated a general role of ubiquitination and programmed cell death in aneurysm pathogenesis. Especially, we further observed participation of BCL-2-mediated apoptosis pathway and caspase-1 related pyroptosis in the development of cerebral aneurysm and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in corresponding transcriptomes."

The subjects were divided into two groups: the Intervention (+) group, which included subjects who underwent pericardiocentesis or pericardiotomy, and the Intervention (-) group, which included subjects who did not undergo pericardiocentesis or pericardiotomy. Variables were then compared between the two groups. There were 68 patients with non-traumatic cardiac tamponade.

    "abstract": "Although a tear-oriented strategy has contributed to improving short-term surgical outcomes of acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD), long-term clinical influences of residual entry tear in the downstream aorta have not been fully investigated. The goal of this study was to assess the long-term surgical outcomes of ATAAD with or without a residual entry tear in the downstream aorta. Medical records of 1107 patients with ATAAD who underwent emergency surgery between 1990 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. A tear-oriented paradigm was adopted for the baseline strategy. The 837 patients in whom the entry tears were resected comprised the resected group, and the 270 patients with a residual entry tear comprised the residual group. Of these patients, 252 in each group were analysed using propensity score matching, and long-term outcomes were compared with or without residual entry. Hospital deaths were lower in the resected group (3.2% vs 8.3%; P = 0.020). The survival rate was not significantly different between the groups: It was 83.8% and 68.5% in the resected group and 80.2% and 66.5% in the residual group at 5 and 10 years, respectively (P = 0.600). However, residual entry in the downstream aorta affected the distal aortic event-free survival rate (90.4% and 80.6% in the resected group and 82.3% and 67.4% in the residual group at 5 and 10 years, respectively; P = 0.003). Furthermore, multivariable risk analysis of 1107 patients confirmed that a residual entry in the downstream aorta was a risk factor for distal aortic events. The tear-oriented strategy remains the gold standard for high-risk patients; however, the extensive operation might be considered for stable patients to reduce long-term aortic events."

    "abstract": "The platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), a novel inflammatory marker, is generally associated with increased in-hospital mortality risk. We aimed to investigate the association between PLR and postoperative in-hospital mortality risk in patients with type A acute aortic dissection (AAAD). Patients (n = 270) who underwent emergency surgery for AAAD at Xiangya Hospital of Central South University between January 2014 and May 2019 were divided into three PLR-based tertiles. We used multiple regression analyses to evaluate the independent effect of PLR on in-hospital mortality, and smooth curve fitting and a segmented regression model with adjustment of confounding factors to analyze the threshold effect between PLR and in-hospital mortality risk. The overall postoperative in-hospital mortality was 13.33%. After adjusting for confounders, in-hospital mortality risk in the medium PLR tertile was the lowest (Odds ratio [OR] = 0.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.06-0.66). We observed a U-shaped relationship between PLR and in-hospital mortality risk after smoothing spline fitting was applied. When PLR < 108, the in-hospital mortality risk increased by 10% per unit decrease in PLR (OR = 0.90, P = 0.001). When the PLR was between 108 and 188, the mortality risk was the lowest (OR = 1.02, P = 0.288). When PLR > 188, the in-hospital mortality risk increased by 6% per unit increase in PLR (OR = 1.06, P = 0.045). There was a U-shaped relationship between PLR and in-hospital mortality in patients with AAAD, with an optimal PLR range for the lowest in-hospital mortality risk of 108-188. PLR may be a useful preoperative prognostic tool for predicting in-hospital mortality risk in patients with AAAD and can ensure risk stratification and early treatment initiation."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic syndromes (AASs) are prone to misdiagnosis by facilities with limited diagnostic experience. We assessed long-term trends in misdiagnosis among patients transferred to a tertiary care facility with presumed AASs. Our institutional transfer center database was queried for emergency transfers in patients with a diagnosis of AASs or thoracic aortic aneurysm between January 2008 and May 2018. There were 784 patients classified as emergency transfer for presumed AAS. Transferring diagnosis and actual diagnosis were compared through a review of physician notes and radiology reports from referring facilities and our center. Mean age was 62 years, with 478 (61%) men. Differences in transferring diagnosis and actual diagnosis were identified in 89 patients (11.4%). Among misdiagnosed patients, the wrong classification of Stanford type A or type B dissections was identified among 24 patients (27%). No dissection was found in 23 patients (26%) with a referring diagnosis of aortic dissection. No signs of rupture were found in 18 patients (20%) transferred for contained/impending rupture. All misdiagnoses were secondary to misinterpretation of radiographic imaging, with motion artifacts in 14 (16%) and postsurgical changes in 22 (25%) being common sources of diagnostic error. Repeat scans were performed in 64 patients (72%) at our facility due to limited access to or suboptimal quality of outside imaging. Although AASs misdiagnosis rates appear to be improving from the prior decade, there are opportunities for improved physician awareness through campaigns such as \"Think Aorta.\" Centralized web-based imaging may prevent the costly hazards of unnecessary emergency transfer."

    "abstract": "There are still gaps regarding the impact of the nationwide lockdown on non-COVID-19 emergency hospitalizations. This study aims to describe the trends in hospitalizations for cardiovascular surgical emergencies in France, before, during and after the first lockdown. All adults admitted for mechanical complications of myocardial infarction (MI), aortic dissection, aortic aneurysm rupture, acute and critical limb ischemia, circulatory assistance, heart transplantation and major amputation were included. This retrospective cohort study used the French National Hospital Discharge database. The numbers of hospitalizations per month in 2020 were compared to the previous three years. From January to September 2020, 94,408 cases of the studied conditions were reported versus 103,126 in the same period in 2019 (-8.5%). There was a deep drop in most conditions during the lockdown, except for circulatory assistance, which increased. After the lockdown, mechanical complications of MI and aortic aneurysm rupture increased, and cardiac transplantations declined compared with previous years. We confirmed a deep drop in most cardiovascular surgical emergencies during the lockdown. The post-lockdown period was characterized by a small over-recovery for mechanical complications of MI and aortic aneurysm rupture, suggesting that many patients were able to access surgery after the lockdown."

Improvements in surgical technique have lowered mortality but postoperative functional status and decreased quality of life due to debilitating deficits remain of concern. Our study aims to identify preoperative conditions predictive of undesirable outcome to help guide perioperative management. We performed retrospective analysis of 394 cases of AAAD who underwent repair in our institution between 2001 and 2018. A combined endpoint of parameters was defined as (1) 30-day versus hospital mortality, (2) new neurological deficit, (3) new acute renal insufficiency requiring postoperative renal replacement, and (4) prolonged mechanical ventilation with need for tracheostomy. Total survival/ follow-up time averaged 3.2 years with follow-up completeness of 94%. Endpoint was reached by 52.8%. Those had higher EuroSCORE II (7.5 versus 5.5), higher incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) (9.2% versus 3.2%), neurological deficit (ND) upon presentation (26.4% versus 11.8%), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (14.4% versus 1.6%) and intubation (RF) before surgery (16.9% versus 4.8%). 7-day mortality was 21.6% versus 0%. Hospital mortality 30.8% versus 0%. This 15-year follow up shows, that unfavorable postoperative clinical outcome is related to ND, CAD, CPR and RF on arrival."

    "abstract": "Coarctation of the aorta represents a narrowing of the thoracic aorta. Hypertensive patients with blood pressure differences ≥20 millimetres of mercury have an indication for surgical or interventional treatment. Implantation of a covered stent became the preferred therapy for the management of this pathology in adolescents/adults. We report the case of a 14-year-old male sportsman, who presented in the emergency room with headache, dizziness, and tinnitus. The clinical exam revealed blood pressure differences between the upper and lower limbs of up to 50 mmHg. Based on the clinical and paraclinical data, we established the diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta and severe secondary arterial hypertension. The case was discussed by a multidisciplinary team and accepted for covered stent implantation. The 24 h blood pressure Holter monitoring after the procedure indicated the persistence of stage I arterial hypertension. Coarctation of the aorta is a congenital cardiovascular anomaly with high morbidity and mortality rates. Arterial hypertension, heart failure, and aortic dissection are complications of this pathology, some of them being sometimes direct consequences of secondary hypertension. Periodic cardiology follow up after the procedure is mandatory to assess the hemodynamic response, to identify potential complications, and to stratify the cardiovascular risk."

A 9-year old boy with Loeys-Dietz Syndrome type 2 and acute type B aortic dissection received an urgent complete thoracic and thoraco-abdominal aortic repair within three days. First, the ascending aorta and aortic root were replaced in a Tirone David and Frozen Elephant Trunk procedure. Then, the descending and supramesenteric aorta was replaced by a Dacron interposition graft with direct implantation of the celiac trunk. During the 15 months follow-up, the patient required three more surgical interventions for rapid expanding aneurysms of both subclavian arteries and the infrarenal aorta. No major adverse event nor secondary interventions occurred. Ultrasonographic and magnetic resonance imaging follow-up is continued at 6-months intervals. Children with Loeys-Dietz Syndrome may require extensive aortic repair for aortic dissection and show rapidly expanding aneurysms.

    "abstract": "Objective: Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a fatal condition that requires emergency surgery. The aim of the present study was to determine pre- and intra-operative risk factors for in-hospital mortality in patients with ATAAD. Methods: Consecutive 313 patients with ATAAD who underwent emergency surgery at our hospital from February 2012 to February 2017 were enrolled in our study. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to identify the pre-operative and intra-operative risk factors for in-hospital mortality. Results: Of the 313 patients, 32 patients (10.2%) died. Compared with survivors, non-survivors had higher heart rate, serum potassium level and EuroSCORE II, and higher incidence of moderate to severe pericardial effusion, supra-aortic vessels involvement, myocardial ischemia and lower-extremity ischemia. As for surgery-related factors, the duration of surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass time were longer in non-survivors than survivors. In addition, non-survivors were more likely to undergo coronary-artery bypass graft compared with survivors. On multivariate analysis, elevated plasma potassium level (OR: 43.0, 95% CI: 3.8-51.5, p < 0.001), high incidence of supra-aortic vessels involvement (OR: 4.4, 95% CI: 1.5-7.0, p = 0.008) and lower-extremity ischemia (OR: 4.9, 95% CI: 1.6-6.9; p = 0.009), and longer duration of surgery (OR 6.0, 95% CI: 1.8-18.7, p = 0.000) and cardiopulmonary bypass time (OR: 3.7, 95% CI: 1.3-9.3, p = 0.001) were independently predictive of higher mortality in patients with ATAAD. Conclusions: Supra-aortic vessels involvement, lower-extremity ischemia and elevated plasma potassium level are independent predictors of mortality in patients with ATAAD. A significant decrease in duration of surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass time is helpful to improve survival of patients."

    "abstract": "a 77-year-old man presented to our Emergency Department for worsening dyspnea. A chest CT scan showed a type A aortic dissection with a dilatation of the ascending and descending aorta. After evaluating the case with cardiac surgeons, it was decided to perform an aortic arch replacement through the frozen elephant trunk technique. Three months after cardiac surgery, a TC scan showed a residual 58 mm dissecting aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta and a collapse of the true lumen so we decided to perform an endovascular treatment of the thoracoabdominal aorta according to the STABILISE technique. Due to the impossibility of cannulating the left renal artery (originating from the false lumen), a partial dilation of the dissecting stent was performed at the origin of the renal arteries, maintaining the communication between true and false lumen at the level of the aortic bifurcation. the STABILISE technique can be applied safely and effectively even in selected cases of residual chronic aortic dissection, constituting a safe and effective alternative to open thoracoabdominal surgery. the presence of a proximal artificial neck without proximal tears in the aortic arch can be a great advantage for subsequent endovascular interventions. It is therefore desirable to design a common surgical strategy within an aortic team to achieve a more favorable preoperative anatomy. Chronic dissection, Frozen elephant trunk, STABILISE. Un uomo di 77 anni affetto da diabete mellito, fibrillazione atriale e broncopneumopatia cronica ostruttiva si è presentato a giugno del 2019 presso il pronto soccorso del nostro Istituto per peggioramento della nota dispnea. Una TC del torace ha mostrato una dissezione aortica di tipo A estesa sino alle arterie iliache comuni bilateralmente, con dilatazione aneurismatica dell’aorta ascendente e discendente (rispettivamente di 52 mm e 62 mm di diametro). Non sono stati riportati altri sintomi di rilievo. Dopo una attenta valutazione collegiale con i colleghi cardiochirurghi, si è deciso di eseguire una sostituzione dell’arco aortico secondo tecnica frozen elephant trunk. La TC di controllo dopo 3 mesi dall’intervento cardiochirurgico ha mostrato la presenza di un aneurisma dissecante residuo dell’aorta toracica discendente di 58 mm di diametro e un collasso del vero lume (diametro minimo 4,5 mm). Previo posizionamento di catetere per deliquorazione, in anestesia generale e tramite accesso chirurgico femorale bilaterale, il trattamento della dissezione aortica è stato quindi completato posizionando due moduli endoprotesici retti in aorta toracica discendente (atterrando a circa 3 cm dal tripode celiaco) e uno stent da dissezione in corrispondenza dell’aorta viscerale. Sotto guida fluoroscopica ed ecografica trans-esofagea è stata eseguita la dilatazione dei dispositivi secondo tecnica STABILISE con corretto risultato angiografico finale. Per l’impossibilità di cannulare l’arteria renale di sinistra (con origine dal falso lume), è stata eseguita una dilatazione parziale dello stent da dissezione in corrispondenza dell’origine delle arterie renali, mantenendo la comunicazione tra vero e falso lume a livello della biforcazione aortica. Le TC di controllo a 1 e 6 mesi hanno dimostrato una diminuzione del diametro totale dell’aorta toracica e un rimodellamento aortico (aumento del diametro del vero lume e cicatrizzazione del falso) in corrispondenza del tratto viscerale, in assenza di dilatazioni di quello sottorenale ed iliaco. La tecnica STABILISE può essere applicata in modo sicuro ed efficace anche in casi selezionati di dissezioni aortiche croniche residue, costituendo una alternativa notevolmente meno invasiva rispetto all’approccio chirurgico toraco-addominale open; un pregresso trattamento con frozen elephant trunk fornisce un’eccellente piattaforma per i successivi interventi endovascolari, garantendo un colletto prossimale senza tear nell’arco aortico."

    "abstract": "Choosing the optimal arterial cannulation site in type A aortic dissection may be challenging. Aortic dissection is a dynamic condition that can change at any time. Thus all the alternatives available should be known by surgeons in order to adapt to the possible problems that may arise. In this video tutorial, we present a patient with acute type A aortic dissection who, after cardiopulmonary bypass with axillary arterial cannulation, developed a major complication: intraoperative malperfusion due to pressurization of the false lumen. The patient developed occlusion of the right coronary artery with electrocardiogram changes, inferior akinesia, and ventricular arrhythmias. Cerebral saturation was also significantly decreased. This scenario of acute malperfusion calls for immediate action.  We proceeded to switch the cardiopulmonary bypass configuration from axillary to direct true lumen cannulation. This technique, also known as the Samurai technique, is feasible in most cases and advantageous in this emergency situation, allowing prompt reestablishment of adequate perfusion of the true lumen . Some authors even advocate more widespread use of this technique because it may ensure antegrade perfusion while avoiding progression of the dissection flap and reduce the rate of the most common complications of other cannulation sites such as plexus injury during axillary cannulation or cerebral embolization through mobilization of thrombi or calcification from femoral retrograde perfusion. This technique is useful in cases of circumferential dissection and in patients with relative contraindications for peripheral cannulation such as morbid obesity or peripheral arterial occlusion by atherosclerosis or by the dissection itself."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) is a catastrophic cardiovascular emergency with a poor prognosis, and little preceding symptoms. Abnormal lipid metabolism is closely related to the pathogenesis of AD. However, comprehensive lipid alterations related to AD pathogenesis remain unclear. Moreover, there is an urgent need for new or better biomarkers for improved risk assessment and surveillance of AD. Therefore, an untargeted lipidomic approach based on ultra-high-performance liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry was employed to unveil plasma lipidomic alterations and potential biomarkers for AD patients in this study. We found that 278 of 439 identified lipid species were significantly altered in AD patients (n = 35) compared to normal controls (n = 32). Notably, most lipid species, including fatty acids, acylcarnitines, cholesteryl ester, ceramides, hexosylceramides, sphingomyelins, lysophosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylinositols, diacylglycerols, and triacylglycerols with total acyl chain carbon number ≥54 and/or total double bond number ≥4 were decreased, whereas phosphatidylethanolamines and triacylglycerols with total double bond number <4 accumulated in AD patients. Besides, the length and unsaturation of acyl chains in triacylglycerols and unsaturation of 1-acyl chain in phosphatidylethanolamines were decreased in AD patients. Moreover, lysophosphatidylcholines were the lipids with the largest alterations, at the center of correlation networks of lipid alterations, and had excellent performances in identifying AD patients. The area under the curve of 1.0 and accuracy rate of 100% could be easily obtained by lysophosphatidylcholine (20:0/0:0) or its combination with lysophosphatidylcholine (17:0/0:0) or lysophosphatidylcholine (20:1/0:0). This study provides novel and comprehensive plasma lipidomic signatures of AD patients, identifies lysophosphatidylcholines as excellent potential biomarkers, and would be beneficial to the pathogenetic study, risk assessment and timely diagnosis and treatment of AD."

The mortality rate of patients with postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) combined with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is remarkable higher than that of patients without AKI. However, incidence of AKI and risk factors for CRRT following TAAR isn't entirely understood. From October 2018 to March 2021, all patients with Stanford type A dissection who underwent total arch replacement surgery under MHCA were enrolled. According to whether CRRT treatment was performed, participants were divided into a CRRT group (n=49) and control group (n=72). Both groups incorporated the brain protection strategy of moderate hypothermia, and the left common carotid artery and the innominate artery were perfused anteriorly. Relevant medical data was collected. Age, gender, and a history of smoking and drinking were not significantly different between the 2 groups (P>0.1). There were statistical differences between the 2 groups in aortic sinus diameter and Bentall procedure (P≤0.05). Univariate analysis revealed that fresh frozen plasma was a protective factor (P<0.05) and the intraoperative transfusion volume of red blood cells, platelets, fresh frozen plasma, autologous blood used for intraoperative bleeding, aortic sinus diameter, and Bentall procedure were risk factors (P<0.1). Multivariate analysis showed that the Bentall procedure and intraoperative bleeding were risk factors for CRRT (P<0.05), and the aortic sinus diameter and intraoperative transfusion score were also risk factors for CRRT (P<0.05). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated that the model of aortic sinus diameter and intraoperative transfusion score had more significantly different discriminatory powers. The Bentall procedure, intraoperative bleeding, aortic sinus diameter, and intraoperative transfusion score were risk factors for postoperative CRRT. The model of aortic sinus diameter and intraoperative transfusion score had more significantly different discriminatory powers."

Population-based administrative health databases for Ontario, Canada, were linked to identify patients who underwent ATAAD repair and survived at least 90 days. Guideline-directed imaging surveillance (GDIS) was defined as undergoing a computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging scan at 6 and 12 months postoperatively and then annually thereafter. Multivariable time-to-event analysis explored the associations between GDIS and all-cause mortality and reintervention. A total of 888 patients who survived urgent ATAAD repair between April 1, 2005, and March 31, 2018, were included. Median follow-up after ATAAD repair was 5.2 years (interquartile range: 2.4-7.9 years). A total of 14% patients received GDIS throughout follow-up. At 6 years, 3.9% of patients had received GDIS. The mortality rate was 4% at 1 year, 14% at 5 years, and 29% at 10 years. Incidence of aortic reintervention was 3% at 1 year, 9% at 5 years, and 17% at 10 years; the majority of these were urgent (68%), and they carried a 9% 30-day mortality rate.

The patient underwent emergent endovascular aortic repair and intra-aortic balloon pump removal with return of lower extremity perfusion. She recovered well and underwent heart and kidney transplant less than 2 months postoperatively."

    "abstract": "The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association define hypertensive emergency (HTN-E) as a systolic blood pressure greater than 180 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure greater than 120 mmHg with evidence of end-organ damage (EOD). Based on expert opinion, current guidelines recommend antihypertensive therapy to reduce blood pressure (BP) at specific hourly rates to reduce progression of EOD, outlined by four criteria. Our goal was to describe compliance with guideline recommendations for early management of HTN-E and to analyze safety outcomes related to pharmacologic intervention. This was a retrospective chart review including patients presenting to the emergency department with HTN-E between September 2016 and August 2020. We excluded patients with a compelling indication for altered therapeutic goals (e.g. acute aortic dissection, hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, and pheochromocytoma). The primary outcome was complete adherence with guideline recommendations in the first 24 h. Of 758 screened records, 402 were included. Mean age was 54 years and majority Black race (72%). Overall, total adherence was poor (<1%): 30% received intravenous therapy within 1 h, 64% achieved 1-h BP goals, 44% achieved 6-h goals, and 9% had appropriate 24-h maintenance BP. Hypotensive events (N = 67) were common and antihypertensive-associated EOD (N = 21) did occur. Predictors of hypotension include treatment within 1 h and management with continuous infusion medication. Current practice is poorly compliant with guideline criteria and there are risks associated with recommended treatments. Our results favor relaxing the expert opinion-based recommendations."

    "abstract": "To report early clinical outcomes of the frozen elephant trunk (FET) technique for the treatment of complex aortic diseases after transition from conventional elephant trunk. A single-center, retrospective study of patients who underwent hybrid aortic arch and FET repair for aortic arch and/or proximal descending aortic aneurysms, acute and chronic Stanford type A aortic dissection with arch and/or proximal descending involvement, Stanford type B acute and chronic aortic dissections with retrograde aortic arch involvement. Between December 2017 and May 2020, 70 consecutive patients (62.7 ± 10.6 years, 59 male) were treated: 41 (58.6%) for emergent conditions and 29 (41.4%) for elective. Technical success was 100%. In-hospital mortality was 14.2% (n = 12, 17.1% emergent vs. 10.3% elective, P = NS); 2 (2.9%) major strokes; 1 (1.4%) spinal cord injury. Mean follow-up was 12.5 months (interquartile range, 3.7-22.3). Overall survival at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months was 90% (95% confidence interval [CI], 83.2-97.3), 85.6% (95% CI, 77.7-94.3), 79.1% (95% CI, 69.9-89.5), 75.6% (95% CI, 65.8-86.9) and 73.5% (95% CI, 63.3-85.3). There were no aortic re-interventions and no distal stent graft-induced new entry (dSINE); 5 patients with residual type B dissection underwent TEVAR completion. In a real-world setting, FET with Thoraflex Hybrid demonstrated feasibility and good clinical outcomes, even in emergent setting. Our implant technique optimize cerebral perfusion reporting good results in terms of neurological complications. Techniques to perfect the procedure and to reduce remaining risks, and consensus on considerations such as standardized cerebral protection need to be reported."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) is a cardiovascular emergency that seriously endangers human health. It has acute onset, dangerous condition and many complications. The mortality without treatment is very high, and the mortality within 24 hours is 25%. AD combined with mesenteric artery malperfusion has an incidence of only 5%, but a hospital mortality rate of up to 33-100%. Mesenteric artery malperfusion increases the mortality of acute AD by 3-4 times. Even after complete revascularization, ischemia/reperfusion injury still leads to frequent postoperative deaths. In this paper, we describe the case of a 60-year-old man with type A aortic dissection and mesenteric artery malperfusion who developed refractory gastrointestinal bleeding postoperatively. He was cured after conservative, interventional, and surgical hemostasis, finally recovered and discharged. This case provides a certain reference value for clinical treatment of such diseases. Aortic dissection combined with mesenteric artery malperfusion is a significant surgical challenge. Ischemia/reperfusion injury may still occur after thoracotomy, even when the blood supply is normalized. Immediate surgery is recommended for preventing death from acute AD, but the strategy should be modified according to the specific symptoms and ischemic severity. In addition, interventional/surgical treatment should be performed more actively in patients with refractory gastrointestinal bleeding after cardiac surgery and a poor response to conservative treatment."

    "abstract": "Type A aortic dissection is a challenging surgical emergency associated with high morbidity and mortality. Many techniques have evolved to repair the dissected sinus segments and restore aortic valve dynamics. Herein, we evaluate the early outcome of a novel technique for reconstruction of dissected aortic root. A prospective study was conducted on 300 patients to evaluate the early results of repair of dissected root in type A aortic dissection. The mean age was 59.65±8.52 years, and 76% of patients were males. All patients had four standard steps for aortic reconstruction: 1) commissural resuspension; 2) right coronary sinus reinforcement with pericardial and Dacron bands; 3) non-coronary sinus reinforcement using external Dacron patch; 4) circumferential inversion of adventitial layer of the root. Patients were followed up clinically, echocardiographically, and by CT scan. The in-hospital mortality was 8%. The mean cross-clamp time was 120±30 minutes, and circulatory arrest time was 25+10 minutes. Twenty-seven patients (9%) experienced postoperative complications, including bleeding and acute kidney injury. During a mean follow-up time of 48±12 months, there were no recurrent aortic dissection, aortic dilatation, pseudoaneurysm, or progression of aortic regurgitation during the entire study period. This reconstructive technique technically is undemanding, feasible, safe, and durable with good early results. A larger cohort of patients with longer period of follow up should generate a more powerful evaluation of this technique."

We aimed to develop deep-learning models (DLMs) with electrocardiography (ECG) and chest x-ray (CXR) features to detect AD and evaluate their performance. This study included 43,473 patients in the emergency department (ED) between July 2012 and December 2019 for retrospective DLM development. A development cohort including 49,071 ED records (120 AD type A and 64 AD type B) was used to train DLMs for ECG and CXR, and 9904 independent ED records (40 AD type A and 34 AD type B) were used to validate DLM performance. Human-machine competitions of ECG and CXR were conducted. Patient characteristics and laboratory results were used to enhance the diagnostic accuracy. The DLM-enabled AD diagnostic process was prospectively evaluated in 25,885 ED visits. The area under the curves (AUCs) of the ECG and CXR models were 0.918 and 0.857 for detecting AD in a human-machine competition, respectively, which were better than those of the participating physicians. In the validation cohort, the AUCs of the integrated model were 0.882, 0.960, and 0.813 in all AD, AD type A, and AD type B patients, respectively, with a sensitivity of 100.0% and a specificity of 81.7% for AD type A. In patients with chest pain and D-dimer tests, the DLM could predict more precisely, achieving a positive predictive value of 62.5% in the prospective evaluation. DLMs may serve as decision-supporting tools for identification of AD and facilitate differential diagnosis in patients with acute chest pain."

We report a case of TAAD complicated by coronary malperfusion successfully treated with PPCI followed by elective corrective surgery. A 48-year-old man was referred to emergency department with acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent PPCI. During the procedure, we realized that the cause of STEMI was TAAD. We decided to continue because the patient experienced seizures and bradycardia. Subsequently, echocardiography and computed tomography confirmed the dissection. The patient was discharged and referred to the National Cardiovascular Center where he underwent successful elective surgery.

    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Aortic arch disease is still a high-risk surgical challenge despite major advances both in surgical and anesthesiological management. A combined surgical and endovascular approach has been proposed for aortic arch disease treatment to avoid hypothermia and circulatory arrest in high-risk patients. Materials and Methods: Between June 2004 and June 2021, 112 patients were referred to our department for aortic arch surgery; 38 (33.9%) patients underwent supra-aortic debranching and endovascular treatment. Of these, 21 (55%) patients underwent type I aortic arch hybrid debranching procedure and in 17 (45%) patients a type II aortic arch hybrid debranching procedure was performed. None of the patients were emergent. Results: No intra-operative deaths were recorded. In the type I aortic arch hybrid debranching patients' group, one patient died at home waiting the endovascular step, one developed ascending aortic dissection and another one developed a pseudoaneurysm at the site of the debranching at follow-up. In the type II aortic arch hybrid debranching patients' group, left carotid artery branch closure was detected at follow-up in one patient. Thirty day/in-hospital rates of adverse neurological events for both the surgical and endovascular procedures were 3% for minor stroke, with no permanent neurological deficit and 0% for permanent paraplegia/paraparesis. In 100% of the cases, the endovascular step succeeded and the type Ia endoleak rate was 0%. Conclusions: Hybrid arch surgery is a valuable option for aortic arch aneurysm treatment in patients with high surgical risk. The choice of aortic arch debranching between type I or type II is crucial and depends on anatomic and clinical patient characteristics. Further larger scale studies are needed to better define the advantages of these techniques."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is an indisputable emergency with very poor outcomes without surgical treatment. Although the aortic arch is often involved in the aortic dissection, its optimal management during surgical therapy remains uncertain. A conservative tear-oriented approach has traditionally been adopted, limiting the procedure to the ascending aorta (or hemiarch) replacement. However, dilation of the residual dissected aorta and subsequent rupture may occur, requiring further intervention in the future. In the last two decades, the frozen elephant trunk (FET) technique has become a valid and attractive option to treat aortic disease when the arch and the thoracic aorta are involved, both in elective and in emergency settings. Here, we report a review of the contemporary literature regarding the short- and long-term outcomes of the FET technique in ATAAD repair."

While type A dissection involving ascending aorta is best managed surgically due to high early mortality, Type B Aortic Dissection (TBAD) involving descending aorta generally has better outcomes with conservative management and medical therapy as a primary strategy is favored. However, there has been a recent paradigm shift in the management of TBAD due to late aneurysmal degeneration of TBAD, increasing morbidity and mortality in the long term. Late surgical intervention can be prevented by early endovascular intervention when combined with optimal medical therapy. In this narrative review, we explore available literature on different endovascular therapies for TBAD in different populations of patients."

Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of EVAR for TAD and report our experience based on patients from our medical center with a relatively long follow-up. A total of 25 consecutive patients with TAD underwent EVAR from October 2015 to October 2020. The demographics, imaging characteristics, clinical features, treatment details, and follow-up results were reviewed. Urgent EVAR was performed in 3 patients (12%), while the remaining 22 patients (88%) underwent delayed EVAR. Systematic heparinization was used in all patients during the endovascular procedure. The EVAR was technically successful in all patients, with no cases converted into open surgery. No death occurred during the perioperative period. One patient presented with a type II endoleak on postoperative 1-month CT images during a mean follow-up of 42.3 ± 17.7 months (5-67.5 months) and showed spontaneous regression of the endoleak without any intervention during the subsequent follow-up. All the patients survived until the time of writing, and none of them showed late endoleak, stent migration, paraplegia, and reintervention. The patients with left subclavian artery covered (n = 8) had no obvious ischemia of the arm and brain. The study results demonstrated that EVAR for TAD proved to be safe and effective, and most patients could undergo delayed EVAR.

Evaluation of the effect of extension of aortic dissection (AAD) according to DeBakey classification, type I and II AAD, and the relationship with preoperative peripheral and myocardial malperfusion on early outcome and the mid-term follow-up period. A total of 135 patients who underwent AAD surgery between January 2015 and October 2019 were analysed. In total 103 patients were affected by DeBakey type I AAD and 32 by DeBakey type II; 56 patients preoperatively showed peripheral, cardiac malperfusion, or both. Intra-operative mortality was 11%. Postoperative peripheral, cardiac malperfusion, and intraoperative and postoperative mortality were lower for type II AAD. The protective factor for intra- and postoperative 60-day mortality was type II AAD (RR = 0.03, p = 0.001); independent predictors were hypertension, and preoperative cardiac and renal-visceral malperfusion. At 5 years the overall survival was 74 ±6.9%. Independent predictors of reduced survival were major extension of type I AAD (RR = 5.37, p < 0.05) and preoperative cardiac malperfusion (RR = 5.78, p < 0.05). Five-year freedom from cardiac death, redo surgical operation, and new vascular procedures on the thoracic and abdominal aorta was 92 ±5.7%, 99 ±1.2%, and 81 ±7.2%, respectively. Extension of DeBakey type I AAD into the thoracic-abdominal aorta segment was also a predictor of the need for new vascular procedures (RR = 1.66, p = 0.05). A more favourable anatomy of DeBakey type II AAD is associated with better early and late outcomes after aortic repair. This is due to a lower incidence of peripheral and cardiac malperfusion."

    "abstract": "Total left-sided haemothorax is a rare and severe complication of acute DeBakey type III aortic dissection. The primary aim of treatment is immediate arrest of haemorrhage and stabilization of the haemodynamic status of the patient. Endovascular isolation of the ruptured thoracic portion of the aorta using a stent graft (TEVAR) has recently become the 'gold standard' in treatment of acute, rupture-complicated aortic dissections of this localization. Described in the article is a clinical case report concerning successful endovascular treatment of a seriously ill patient with dissection of the thoracoabdominal portion of the aorta, rupture and massive haemorrhage into the left pleural cavity. The patient underwent endoprosthetic repair of the descending aorta in the setting of a hybrid operating room under local anaesthesia, followed by drainage of the left pleural cavity. The postoperative period was uneventful with no complications. The patient was discharged in a satisfactory condition on day 10 after the emergency surgical intervention. An important advantage of TEVAR for aortic ruptures is a minimally invasive nature of the procedure, consisting in no need to perform either sternothoracotomy or to connect a heart-lung machine, thus decreasing surgical wound, reducing the risk of perioperative life-threatening haemorrhage, and contributing to early activation of the patient. Тотальный левосторонний гемоторакс – редкое и тяжелое осложнение острой диссекции аорты III типа по DeBakey.

A 77-year-old man with a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented after an outpatient nuclear stress test demonstrated a reversible inferior wall defect. He was subsequently referred to a cardio-thoracic surgeon and underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Three weeks later, the patient presented to the emergency department complaining of a productive cough, nausea, vomiting, and fever. He was diagnosed with sepsis secondary to pneumonia. A CT chest demonstrated a new 3.9 cm long segment of dissection in the ascending thoracic aorta. Due to postoperative recovery from recent CABG, a decision was made to treat the ascending thoracic aortic dissection (Stanford type A) medically. He was advised to continue intensive antihypertensive medications and close follow-up with a cardiologist and cardiothoracic surgeon on an outpatient basis. Subsequent follow-up CT chest angiography at one month, four months, and 12 months later did not demonstrate the progression of the ascending aortic dissection. Decisions to deviate from the usual care should best be taken in a multidisciplinary team approach. Patients should clearly be informed about the rationale behind these complex decisions."

    "abstract": "Aortic aneurysm and dissection are important causes of morbimortality in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) and other connective tissue diseases that affect the cardiovascular tissues. Timely intervention through different surgical techniques improves the prognosis. Both sparing and replacement-type interventions of the aortic valve are used, but selection depends on the condition of the patient at the time of diagnosis, the patient's emergency condition, surgeon preference and hospital resources. Previous meta-analyses have suggested an advantage with the use of sparing-type interventions, but this finding must be updated and extended to patients with other connective tissue disorders. The objetive of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of valve-sparing root replacement versus aortic root replacement procedures in patients with MFS and similar connective tissue diseases that present with aortic aneurysm or dissection. A systematic review of cohort studies that evaluated sparing-type (preserving, remodeling, reimplantation, Yacoub, David or Florida Sleeve) or replacement-type (repair, Bentall, Button-Bentall, composite valve graft or Cabrol) procedures in patients with Marfan, Loeys-Dietz, Beals-Hecht or Ehlers-Danlos syndromes was done. Studies were retrieved from the SCOPUS, MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and LILACS electronic databases up to January 2020 without language restrictions. Only studies that directly compared sparing- versus replacement-type procedures were included in the meta-analysis. A total of 33 studies (n=1,807 subjects) reported sparing-type surgical interventions and 26 studies (n=2,218 subjects) reported replacement-type surgical interventions. Pooled rates of endocarditis, thromboembolism and aneurysm were higher in replacement-type surgical intervention studies. Sixteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. Sparing-type interventions were associated with a reduced risk of endocarditis (RR =0.13, 95% CI: 0.03-0.61); however, replacement-type interventions favored freedom from valve reoperation (RR =2.39, 95% CI: 1.24-4.60). All studies were at low risk of bias. The choice of the best surgical technique is dependent on the type of disease (MFS or other connective tissue diseases) as well as the accompanying aortic and cardiovascular damage, since these key factors are heterogeneous. Although the results of this meta-analysis tend to show some advantages for one type of surgical intervention over the other and viceversa, the surgeon can only make the best decision during the surgical act."

D-dimer, both alone and in combination with the Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score (ADD-RS), has been studied as a tool to evaluate for AD. Can a negative D-dimer in low-risk patients exclude AD in the emergency department? Retrieved studies included three systematic review and meta-analyses and two prospective cohort studies. D-dimer was found to be highly sensitive for acute AD, with a sensitivity of 98.0%. The ADD-RS was also highly sensitive (95.7%) for AD. Two meta-analyses reported a combination of a negative D-dimer and ADD-RS < 1 to have a pooled sensitivity of 99.9% and 100% for acute aortic syndrome. Neither D-dimer nor the ADD-RS alone provides adequate sensitivity to exclude acute AD. However, a negative D-dimer combined with an ADD-RS < 1 is likely sufficient to rule out AD. Even with these findings, physicians must place clinical judgment above laboratory testing or scoring systems when deciding whether to pursue a diagnosis of acute AD."

    "abstract": "Despite decades of study into aortic dissection (AD), a lethal cardiovascular emergency due to a tear in the aorta intima or bleeding within the aortic wall, leading to the separation of the different layers of it, the factors that influence its progression and the deeper regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. Nowadays, with the maturity of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) sequence technology, m6A modification, one type of RNA epigenesis, has gradually become a new research hotspot for epigenetic molecular regulation. Especially recently, increasing evidence has revealed that m6A modification functions as a pivotal post-transcriptional modification to influence the progression of multiple diseases. Based on these findings, it is reasonable to speculate that m6A modification may affect the onset and progression of AD. To explore the validity of our conjecture and to elucidate its underlying molecular mechanism of action, we conducted the present study. In this study, we found that KIAA1429 is downregulated while ALKBH5 is upregulated in aortic tissues from AD patients. Furthermore, gain- and loss-of-function studies showed that KIAA1429 and ALKBH5 can oppositely regulate HASMC proliferation, HAEC apoptosis, and AD progression in AngII-infused mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that KIAA1429/ALKBH5-mediated m6A modifications can regulate the processing of pri-miR-143-3p through interacting with the microprocessor protein DGCR8, thus indirectly regulating the downstream target gene of mature miR-143-3p, DDX6, to perform their biological functions in vitro and in vivo. Our findings have revealed a novel connection between m6A modification and AD progression and may provide a novel molecular basis for subsequent researchers to search for novel therapeutic approaches to improve the health of patients struggling with AD."

    "abstract": "Ascending aorta mycotic aneurysm is a rare entity. It is a life-threatening condition because of the possibility of aortic dissection, or rupture. Escherichia coli is recognised as an uncommon cause of aortic mycotic aneurysm. An 81-year-old woman with a history of Escherichia coli pyelonephritis 4 months previously, was admitted to our centre for a mycotic aneurysm of the ascending aorta caused by Escherichia coli. She was successfully treated by urgent in situ replacement of the ascending aorta with a cryopreserved homograft, combined with antibiotics. Although infrequent, Escherichia coli mycotic aneurysm should be suspected in older patients with atherosclerosis and who developed septicaemia. Prompt treatment with a combination of appropriate antibiotics and surgery is required."

CCTA provided accurate diagnosis and guided therapy without delay. A 51-year-old man with mechanical aortic valve replacement was admitted for severe chest pain. CCTA showed type A aortic dissection with an entry tear at the ostial left main coronary artery. Given the high surgical risk, he underwent fenestration of the false lumen. Twelve days postoperatively, he had chest pain with anterior STEMI. Urgent CCTA showed two left coronary thrombi with transmural extensive ischemia. Urgent thrombus aspiration and percutaneous coronary intervention were performed. A drug-eluting stent was placed on the proximal LAD. CCTA was crucial prior to PCI in order to define the etiology of STEMI and evaluate the vascular access."

This study attempts to explore the significance of the national early warning score (NEWS) in monitoring the condition of patients with acute aortic dissection during emergency observation and to provide evidence for emergency nurses in optimal and scientific monitoring of patients. The case-control method was used to continuously enrol patients with acute aortic dissection who had been in the emergency department; the STROBE checklist was used in this process. Based on patients' clinical deterioration, they were divided into two groups: clinical deterioration and non-clinical deterioration. The NEWS at each time point was compared by independent-samples t-test, and the predictive power of NEWS was evaluated according to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. A total of 290 patients with acute aortic dissection were included: 46 patients showed clinical deterioration and 244 did not. There were significant differences in the NEW scores of the two groups at admission time and at 12, 8, 4 and 0.5 h before clinical deterioration. The NEW scores of the clinical deterioration group showed an upward trend, while the non-clinical deterioration group showed a relatively stable trend. The NEWS can be used to predict the occurrence of clinical deterioration earlier at 4 h before clinical deterioration. Simultaneously, the patient's respiration rate and SpO2 had better predictive performance than other vital signs. The NEWS can be used to triage patients with acute aortic dissection admitted to the emergency department. Continuous use of the NEWS for monitoring can play a vital role in early warning of clinical deterioration in patients with acute aortic dissection. In clinical care, attention should also be paid when patients with acute aortic dissection have abnormal respiration rate and SpO2 ."

The thoracic endograft was modified on a back table while anesthesia was given, and arterial accesses were acquired. FTEVAR was performed smoothly without any complication. Completion angiogram showed no evidence of endoleak or active bleeding. Chest tube was then placed, and the left lung gradually expanded. Postoperative hospital courses were uneventful. Follow-up CTA showed the thoracic endograft and the LSA stent were in good position, and the rupture thoracic aorta was completely sealed. Chest tube was removed on postoperative day (POD) 7.

    "abstract": "Body packing is defined as the ingestion of drug packets, to conceal them during transportation. We report the case of a 63-year-old cocaine body packer, who died from an aortic dissection. He was arrested in Paris as he disembarked from a flight from Cayenne (French Guinea) and custom officers found cocaine in his suitcase. The patient admitted the ingestion of cocaine packets. He was transferred to the hospital where an initial computerized tomography scan showed hyperdense, uniformly shaped packets located in the colon. On admission, his blood pressure was elevated but he did not exhibit any other signs of adrenergic syndrome. The diagnosis of chronic hypertension unrelated to the cocaine body packing was retained. During hospitalization, 40 h after the ingestion of the cocaine packets, the patient showed acute agitation, sweat and a high blood pressure. Given the context, an emergency thoraco-abdominal-pelvic CT-scan was carried out to rule out a cocaine leakage. None of the packets showed evidence of leakage but the CT-scan assessed an aortic dissection extending to the entire descending aorta. Despite intensive care, the patient passed away on the fifth day. This aortic dissection could have appeared spontaneously in a patient with significant atherosclerosis lesions of the aortic network. Nevertheless, we believe that cocaine impregnation causing high blood pressure might have played a role in the aortic dissection, even without a cocaine leakage from the packets. This case highlights the need to achieve an effective control of the blood pressure in cocaine body packers."

    "abstract": "Our objective was to examine intermediate-term survival and reinterventions in unselected patients, stratified according to indication, who received a Freestyle (Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, Minn) bioprosthesis as a full aortic root replacement. Data from medical records were retrospectively collected for patients who had aortic root replacement using Freestyle bioprostheses between 1999 and 2018 at 6 North-Atlantic centers. Survival status was extracted from national registries and results stratified according to indication for surgery. We included 1030 implantations in 1008 patients with elective indications for surgery: aneurysm (39.8%), small root (8.3%), and other (13.8%), and urgent/emergent indications: endocarditis (26.7%) and Stanford type A aortic dissection (11.4%). Across indications, 46.3% were nonelective cases and 34.0% were reoperations. Median age was 66.0 (interquartile range, 58.0-71.8) years and median follow-up was 5.0 (interquartile range, 2.6-7.9) years. Thirty-day mortality varied from 2.9% to 27.4% depending on indication. Intermediate survival for 90-day survivors with elective indications were not different from the general population standardized for age and sex (P = .95, .83, and .16 for aneurysms, small roots, and other, respectively). In contrast, patients with endocarditis and type A dissection had excess mortality (P &lt; .001). Freedom from valve reinterventions was 95.0% and 94.4% at 5 and 8 years, respectively. In all, 52 patients (5.2%) underwent reinterventions, most because of endocarditis. At intermediate term follow-up this retrospective study provides further support for the use of the Freestyle bioprosthesis in the real-world setting of diverse, complex, and often high-risk aortic root replacement and suggests that outcome is determined by patient and disease, rather than by prosthesis, characteristics."

Acute aortic dissection is a rare condition, such that many patients will not survive without reconstructive surgery. We present a case 24-year-old male who came with symptoms of shortness of breath and cough. The patient underwent ECG, chest radiology, and ultrasound, where the patient was found to have right pleural effusion while his ECG was normal. In the history taken from the patient, he had no underlying disease, no history of heart diseases in his family. For a better diagnosis, ETT and aortic CT angiography was performed on the patient which confirmed the evidence of dissection. Immediately after the diagnosis, necessary arrangements were made for open heart surgery and the patient was prepared for surgery. The patient was admitted in the cardiac surgery ICU for 5 days and his medication was carefully administered. After the conditions were stabilized, the patient was transferred to the post-cardiac surgery ICU ward. The patient was discharged from the hospital one week after the surgery and returned to the office as an OPD one week after his discharge. Various risk factors can play a role in creating aortic dissection. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to patients' history for achieving a quick and definitive diagnosis. Therefore, to control the complications of placing the cannula as well as the duration of the surgery, it is very important to reduce the duration of pumping on the patient and to be very careful during the cannula placement."

    "abstract": "Open total arch replacement remains the gold standard treatment for aneurysms and dissections involving the aortic arch. However, high-risk surgical candidates may benefit from endovascular techniques to reduce the risk of perioperative mortality and morbidity, especially neurologic complications. Numerous endografts are available for investigational use in the aortic arch as part of investigational device exemption (IDE) programs. Some devices are fenestrated or scalloped, while others are branched, ranging from single branch to triple branch stent-grafts. Furthermore, chimney techniques and in situ fenestration may be utilized in bailout or emergent situations. Initial results describing outcomes of complete endovascular repair of the aortic arch are encouraging, with current data estimating that technical success ranges from 84.2% to 100%. Moreover, operative mortality may be as high as 13.2%, while neurologic complications also remain common, with stroke rates being as high as 20% and spinal cord ischemia being as high as 3.1%. However, more data are necessary to determine the comparative treatment effect of endovascular stent-grafting of the aortic arch, compared with conventional open and hybrid repairs. Longitudinal follow-up is also lacking, which will determine the long-term durability of endografts in the aortic arch. Nevertheless, endovascular repair represents an important opportunity for improving outcomes in patients with complex and potentially devastating pathologies of the aortic arch."

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be used to provide circulatory support, termed venoarterial (VA) ECMO; or respiratory support termed venovenous (VV) ECMO. The clinical utility of ECMO in poisoned patients remains unclear and guidelines on its use in this setting are lacking. To perform a literature search and narrative review on the use of ECMO in poisonings. Additionally, to provide recommendations on the use of ECMO in poisonings from physicians with expertise in ECMO, medical toxicology, critical care, and emergency medicine. A literature search in Ovid MEDLINE from 1946 to October 14, 2020, was performed to identify relevant articles with a strategy utilizing both MeSH terms and adjacency searching that encompassed both extracorporeal life support/ECMO/Membrane Oxygenation concepts and chemically-induced disorders/toxicity/poisoning concepts, which identified 318 unique records. Twelve additional manuscripts were identified by the authors for a total of 330 articles for screening, of which 156 were included for this report. The use of ECMO in poisoned patients is significantly increasing over time. Available retrospective data suggest that patients receiving VA ECMO for refractory shock or cardiac arrest due to poisoning have lower mortality as compared to those who receive VA ECMO for non-poisoning-related indications. Poisoned patients treated with ECMO have reduced mortality as compared to those treated without ECMO with similar severity of illness and after adjusted analyses, regardless of the type of ingestion. This is especially evident for poisoned patients with refractory cardiac arrest placed on VA ECMO (termed extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation [ECPR]). We suggest VA ECMO be considered for poisoned patients with refractory cardiogenic shock (continued shock with myocardial dysfunction despite fluid resuscitation, vasoactive support, and indicated toxicologic therapies such as glucagon, intravenous lipid emulsion, hyperinsulinemia euglycemia therapy, or others), and strongly considered for patients with cardiac arrest in institutions which are structured to deliver effective ECPR. VV ECMO should be considered in poisoned patients with ARDS or severe respiratory failure according to traditional indications for ECMO in this setting. Patients with pre-existing comorbidities with low expected survival or recovery. Relative contraindications vary based on each center's experience but often include: severe brain injury; advanced age; unrepaired aortic dissection or severe aortic regurgitation in VA ECMO; irreversible organ injury; contraindication to systemic anticoagulation, such as severe hemorrhage. ECMO may provide hemodynamic or respiratory support to poisoned patients while they recover from the toxic exposure and metabolize or eliminate the toxic agent. Available literature suggests a potential benefit for ECMO use in selected poisoned patients with refractory shock, cardiac arrest, or respiratory failure. Future studies may help to further our understanding of the use and complications of ECMO in poisoned patients."

A single-stage hybrid procedure was planned in an urgent setting. Initially, a left common carotid-to-left subclavian artery (LCCA-LSA) bypass was performed to gain a suitable proximal landing zone, the procedure was then completed with 3 thoracic endografts and 1 aortic dissection stent through a percutaneous femoral approach. The patient was discharged in postoperative day 8th without complications; the CTA performed at 1 month demonstrated patency of supra-aortic and visceral vessels, dilation of CoA site and exclusion of the false lumen. CoA is a congenital malformation rarely found in adults that may represent a challenge for the surgeon, especially when combined with a complication like an acute aortic dissection.

We conceived two different modifications of the original technique to perform an arch replacement with a branched graft, while arranging an adequate landing zone for a subsequent thoracic endovascular aortic repair, without the need of dedicated material. Eight consecutive patients underwent arch replacement with one of our techniques. Five were emergency patients with acute aortic dissection, and 3 suffered chronic expansive disease. The \"modified elephant trunk\" includes a separate anastomosis of an endo-luminal prosthetic segment in the descending aorta. Subsequently, the branched arch prosthesis is anastomosed to the distal aortic stump with the attached trunk. In the \"prophylactic debranching\", a tail is left on the distal end of the arch prosthesis, so that the branches for the supra-aortic vessels will remain displaced proximally, allowing a \"zone 1\" available for landing. Three patients experienced transient cerebral deficits (1 transient ischemic attack and post-operative delirium in 2 cases), 1 required re-operation for bleeding and 2 needed prolonged intubation. One died of multi-organ failure. Both techniques proved to be easily reproducible, and allow an adequate landing zone for a subsequent endovascular procedure, while retaining the advantages of using a tetra-furcated prosthesis. They are a viable alternative when a hybrid prosthesis cannot be implanted."

One hundred sixteen patients who received Stanford type A aortic dissection from January 2012 to December 2019 were recruited. All patients received surgery under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) and general anesthesia. They were grouped by degree of postoperative cerebral neurological complication. The related factors of cerebral neurological complications were analyzed by single-factor analysis and multi-factor logistic regression. Postoperative neurological complications were observed in 31 cases (26.72 %). Two groups were identified: permanent neurological dysfunction (PND) was observed in seven cases, and temporary neurological dysfunction (TND) was observed in 24 cases. In-hospital mortality was 9.48 % (11/116), with six in the cerebral complication groups and five in the non-complication group. Single-factor analysis showed the associated factors were age, stroke history, carotid plaque or stenosis, emergency surgery, renal dysfunction, hypotension, aortic clamping time, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest time, postoperative hypoxemia, postoperative low cardiac output and plasma transfusion >800 ml, and erythrocyte suspension transfusion >6 U. Multi-factor logistic analysis showed the independent predictive factors were DHCA time >40 min, plasma transfusion >800 ml, erythrocyte suspension transfusion >6 U, history of stroke, and carotid plaque or stenosis. The factors independently associated with neurological complications are DHCA time >40 min, plasma transfusion >800 ml, erythrocyte suspension transfusion >6 U, history of stroke, and carotid plaque or stenosis. Our findings suggest that patients with these risk factors should receive intervention during treatment to reduce cerebral neurological complications."

Patients undergoing thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) with the device between 2017 and 2020 were identified from a prospectively maintained single-centre database and retrospectively analysed. Predominant indications were aortic dissection (n = 46), thoracic/thoraco-abdominal aneurysm (n = 20/n = 7), penetrating ulcer (n = 14) and intramural haematoma (n = 12). Emergency procedures were performed in 47% (54/115). The primary outcome was technical success. Secondary outcomes were clinical success, serious adverse events and procedure-related reintervention. ACS was assessed regarding angulation, accuracy and apposition. The median follow-up was 8.46 months (interquartile range: 3.18-16.89 months). A total of 115 consecutive patients (82 males, median age 63; interquartile range: 53-74 years) have been included. Technical success was achieved in 95.7% (110/115). Clinical success rate was 80.9% (93/115); mostly due to procedure-related death (n = 14). Overall mortality was 19.1% (22/115), with significant differences between elective/emergency procedures (log-rank: P < 0.001). Procedure-related serious adverse event rate was 44.3% (51/115). Procedure-related reintervention was performed in 20.9% (24/115). The cumulative incidence for reintervention differed significantly between elective/emergency cases (Gray's test: P = 0.0033). Angulation was used in 40.9% of patients (47/115), mostly in type II arches (52.7%). Deployment accuracy was 87.8% (101/115). Sufficient apposition was present in 93.0% (107/115). This single-centre study shows encouraging performance of the CTAG with ACS in an array of aortic pathologies. Although longer-term data must be awaited, ACS leads to overall favourable device placement. Despite ongoing advances in device technology, TEVAR remains challenging and is associated with significant burden inherent to the underlying disease."

    "title": "Expression and role of lumican in acute aortic dissection: A human and mouse study.",
    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) is a life-threatening emergency, and lumican (LUM) is a potential Biomarker for AD diagnosis. We investigated LUM expression patterns in patients with AD and explored the molecular functions of Lum in AD mice model. LUM expression patterns were analyzed using aortic tissues of AD patients, and serum soluble LUM (s-LUM) levels were compared between patients with acute AD (AAD) and chronic AD (CAD). Lum-knockout (Lum-/-) mice were challenged with β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) and angiotensin II (Ang II) to induce AD. The survival rate, AD incidence, and aortic aneurysm (AA) in these mice were compared with those in BAPN-Ang II-challenged wildtype (WT) mice. Tgf-β/Smad2, Mmps, Lum, and Nox expression patterns were examined. LUM expression was detected in the intima and media of the ascending aorta in patients with AAD. Serum s-LUM levels were significantly higher in patients with AAD than CAD. Furthermore, AD-associated mortality and thoracic aortic rupture incidence were significantly higher in the Lum-/- AD mice than in the WT AD mice. However, no significant pathologic changes in AA were observed in the Lum-/- AD mice compared with the WT AD mice. The BAPN-Ang II-challenged WT and Lum-/- AD mice had higher Tgf-β, p-Smad2, Mmp2, Mmp9, and Nox4 levels than those of non-AD mice. We also found that Lum expression was significantly higher in the BAPN-Ang II-challenged WT in comparison to the unchallenged WT mice. LUM expression was altered in patients with AD display increased s-LUM in blood, and Lum-/- mice exhibited augmented AD pathogenesis. These findings support the notion that LUM is a biomarker signifying the pathogenesis of injured aorta seen in AAD. The presence of LUM is essential for maintenance of connective tissue integrity. Future studies should elucidate the mechanisms underlying LUM association in aortic changes."

    "title": "AT1R Regulates Macrophage Polarization Through YAP and Regulates Aortic Dissection Incidence.",
    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) is one of the most fatal cardiovascular emergency. At the anatomical level, AD occurs due to the formation of intimal tears. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unknown. Angiotensin II (Ang II) is a important effector in the development of cardiovascular disease that acts through binding to angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R). Yes-associated protein (YAP) was recently recognized as a key protein in macrophage activation. To determine whether AT1R and YAP are involved in macrophage-induced endothelial cell (EC) inflammation and AD incidence, we co-cultured THP-1 cells and HAECs in transwell chambers under different culture conditions and apply different conditions to the AD mice model. The results showed that Ang II promoted macrophage M1 polarization and adhesion, upregulated YAP phosphorylation, and induced EC injury that was related to increased levels of multiple pro-inflammatory chemokines. Blocking AT1R function pharmacologically or by transfection with AT1R siRNA can reduce the pro-inflammatory effect induced by Ang II. In addition, siRNA knock down of YAP expression further aggravated the pro-inflammatory effects of Ang II. Treatment with ARB effectively alleviated these pro-inflammatory effects. In the mice AD model, ARB effectively reduced the incidence of AD in mice, decreased M1 macrophages infiltration and AT1R content in the aortic wall and increased the tissue content of YAP. We found that AT1R induces YAP phosphorylation through binding to Ang II, and further promotes macrophage M1 polarization and adhesion to ECs. ARB reduces the incidence of AD in mice and affect macrophage polarization in mice aorta."

    "abstract": "Blunt abdominal aortic injury (BAAI) resulting from blunt abdominal trauma is rare; therefore, there are no standard guidelines for its treatment. Herein, we report the successful treatment of BAAI via endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) performed immediately after emergency laparotomy to repair a bowel injury. A 78-year-old man was injured after being caught between a shovel car and the bumper of his own car for approximately 15 s. Upon arrival at the hospital, the patient was conscious and had stable vital signs, abdominal and low back pain, and numbness in the right lower limb. Computed tomography revealed contrast medium leakage into the mesentery, as well as aortic dissection and rupture. Hemostasis and intestinal resection were completed, and EVAR was performed immediately after abdominal closure. The patient was discharged from the hospital at 35 days after surgery. In this case, there existed a risk of artificial blood vessel infection if reconstruction was simultaneously performed with intestinal resection. Symptoms of lower limb ischemia that were observed prior to surgery resolved. After open surgery, bleeding was controlled, and the patient's vital signs were stable. EVAR was performed as treatment for aortic injury, thereby reducing the risk of direct implant infection and enabling minimally invasive treatment. EVAR may be useful for the treatment of BAAI in the presence of intestinal injuries, reduce the risk of implant infection, and allow for a one-time, minimally invasive treatment."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (AAAD) is a pathological process that implicates the ascending aorta and represents a surgical emergency burdened by high mortality if not promptly treated in the first hours of onset. Despite best efforts, the annual incidence rates of aortic dissection has remained stable over the past decades. We measured aortic dimensions (aortic diameters, area, length and volume) using 3D multiplanar reconstruction imaging with the purpose of refining the risk- morphology for AAAD. Computerized tomography angiography studies of three groups were compared retrospectively: patients affected by AAAD (AAAD group; n=71), patients affected by aortic aneurysm and subsequently subjected to ascending aorta replacement (Aneurysm, n=77) and a healthy aorta's group (Control, n=75). Mean diameters of AAAD (4.9 cm) and Aneurysm (5.1 cm) aortas were significantly larger than those of the control group (3.4 cm). In AAAD patients, an ascending aorta diameter greater than 5.5 cm was observed in 18% of patients. Multiple comparisons showed statistically significant differences among mean of the ratio of aortic root area to height between the three groups (P<0.001). In frontal and sagittal planes, the length of the ascending aorta was significantly greater in patients affected by aortic pathology (AAAD and aneurysm) than in the control group (P<0.001). Significant differences were confirmed when indexing the aortic length to patient's height and BSA, and the aortic volume to patient's BSA. Maximum transverse diameter, considered separately, is not the best predictor of aortic dissection. In our opinion, the introduction into clinical practice of measurements of the area, length, and volume of the aorta, as absolute or indexed values, could improve the selection of patients who would benefit from preventive surgical aortic replacement."

The first patient was an 81-year-old female with a history of abdominal pain and a ruptured aortic aneurysm diagnosed by AngioCT-scan. The second patient was a 63-year-old male with a history of oral digestive bleeding and an AngioCT-scan showing an aortoenteric fistula. The third patient was a 77-year-old female with sudden-onset abdominal pain and ruptured right common iliac aneurysm. The fourth patient presented with abdominal pain and an AngioCT-scan showed aortic rupture. All four patients were discharged with no major complications or surgical mortality. These case series show that despite the Covid-19 pandemic situation, since elective surgeries decreased, vascular emergencies have increased. Relatamos uma série de casos de quatro pacientes consecutivos, admitidos com emergências relacionadas a aneurismas aortoilíacos em um período de 3 dias e submetidos a tratamento endovascular. A primeira paciente, do sexo feminino, com 81 anos e com histórico de aneurisma da aorta, apresentou dor abdominal iniciada nos últimos 12 dias. O segundo paciente era do sexo masculino, com 63 anos e foi admitido com hematêmese 3 dias antes da admissão, com angiotomografia demonstrando fistula aortoentérica. A terceira paciente, do sexo feminino e com 77 anos, foi admitida com quadro de ruptura de aneurisma da artéria ilíaca comum direita. O quarto paciente consecutivo apresentou dor abdominal iniciada 2 semanas antes da internação e aneurisma roto da aorta. Todos os quatro pacientes apresentaram emergências aortoilíacas e receberam alta sem complicações maiores ou mortalidade cirúrgica. O relato desta série de casos demonstra que, apesar da situação pandêmica da COVID-19, uma vez que as cirurgias eletivas diminuíram, as urgências vasculares aumentaram."

    "abstract": "There has been a growing interest in antegrade cannulation techniques in type A aortic dissection surgery. Axillary cannulation has previously been reported to provide better outcomes in terms of short-term mortality and neurological event. Consensus regarding the best cannulation strategy still remains controversial. The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were conducted up until October 3, 2020. Data regarding mortality, stroke, reoperation for bleeding and length of hospital stay, wound infection and cardiopulmonary bypass time were extracted and submitted to a meta-analysis using random-effects modelling and the I2 -test for heterogeneity. Fourteen retrospective observational studies were included, enrolling a total of 2621 patients. There were a total of 2621 patients (1327 axillary cannulation and 874 femoral cannulation). Axillary cannulation was associated with reduced short term mortality (pooled odds ratio [OR] = +0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] = +0.25 to +0.70; p = .0009) compared to femoral cannulation. Axillary cannulation was also associated with a lower incidence of neurological events (pooled OR = +0.63, 95% CI = +0.42 to +0.94; p = .02). Our meta-analyses suggests that axillary cannulation has superior outcomes in terms of mortality and stroke following emergency surgery for type A aortic dissection. However, the lack of high quality randomized controlled trials does not make this recommendation generalisable to all units."

The classic presenting symptom of abrupt-onset, severe \"tearing\" or \"ripping\" chest pain may be an unreliable finding. We present the case of a 30-year-old previously healthy male with no known risk factors who turned around to sanitize after having a bowel movement when he began feeling tight, severe back pain. After ruling out common etiologies of acute back pain with a negative computed tomography (CT) scan, point-of-care ultrasonography was performed which revealed a crescent-shaped flap within the abdominal aorta. Follow-up computed tomography angiogram (CTA) confirmed an extensive Stanford type A aortic dissection. Remarkably, the patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout his emergency department (ED) visit without developing any new pulse deficits or heart murmurs. It is a good reminder to maintain a high index of suspicion for aortic dissection in patients presenting with acute back pain without any classic risk factors. We also review the most recent literature regarding aortic dissection in young adults and ultrasonography for aiding diagnosis in the ED.

To evaluate the multidisciplinary management of MS patients during labor. Nineteen pregnant women (31 pregnancies) with MS were followed by a multi-disciplinary team (cardiologist, obstetrician, anesthesiologist) prior to delivery. Two patients had kyphoscoliosis; none had previous spine surgery nor complaints compatible with DE. In eight pregnancies (7 patients), aortic root diameter (ARd) before pregnancy was 40 to 46 mm. In this high-risk group, one patient underwent elective termination, two underwent an urgent cesarean section (CS) under general anesthesia, and five had elective CS; two under general anesthesia (GA), and three under spinal anesthesia. In 23 pregnancies (12 patients), ARd was < 40 mm. In this non-high-risk group three pregnancies (1 patient) were electively terminated. Of the remaining 20 deliveries (11 patients), 14 were vaginal deliveries, 9 with epidural analgesia and 5 without. Six patients had a CS; four under GA and two2 under spinal anesthesia. There were no epidural placement failures and no failed responses. There were 2 cases of aortic dissection, unrelated to the anesthetic management. The optimal anesthetic strategy during labor in MS patients should be decided by a multi-disciplinary team. Anesthetic complications due to DE were not encountered during neuraxial block."

From November 2016 to December 2017, the data from 35 cases of aortic reoperation at our institution, out of 212 consecutive aortic repairs, were reviewed. We retrospectively summarized and analyzed their surgical indications, operative data, time interval from previous aortic repair, and outcomes. The time intervals until reoperation were analyzed for differences. Patients' mean age was 40.9±14.5 years, and 25 of them were men (71.4%). The indications for reoperation were aortic valvular problem (14.3%), aneurysmal dilatation (25.7%), pseudoaneurysm formation due to anastomotic leakage (43.2%), and aortic dissection (17.1%). For patients who had underwent primarily emergency operations due to aortic dissection, the time interval until reoperation (4.8±3.2 years) was significantly shorter than that of the whole group (5.5±3.6 years, P<0.01). Among the 35 reoperations, Sun's procedure was selected for 16 patients (45.7%) with total aortic arch reconstruction. The average follow-up was 12 months (range 9-15 months). Hospital mortality was 5.7% (two patients). Among the hospital survivors there were no cases of death, rupture of residual dissection, paraplegia, or central nervous system complications during the follow-up period. Patients with acute aortic dissection required repeat surgery significantly earlier compared to other diseases. As to reoperation strategy, we recommend Sun's procedure as the choice for extended arch reconstruction since minimal effect on overall mortality and complication rates were found."

Initially, conservative management was chosen, as indicated for an uncomplicated type B dissection, but the dissection deteriorated. Despite the fact that severe occlusion of the celiac artery was detected on Computed Tomography (CT) angiography, the Arc of Buhler anatomical variation was present, contributing adequate visceral blood supply. After considering this finding, the patient was treated effectively with thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). A presença da síndrome de má perfusão em casos de dissecção aórtica aguda do tipo B complicada é um fator preditor negativo, e uma intervenção urgente é indicada.

We performed a population-based review of all patients with AAD in a well-defined geographical area in Japan between 2016 and 2018. Data of all patients with AAD at Miyazaki Prefectural Nobeoka Hospital (MPNH), which performs medical care for 120 000 residents, were collected retrospectively. The emergency medical service is dedicated to the transfer of all patients in this area to the MPNH. For all patients who were dead on arrival, the diagnosis of AAD was made by autopsy imaging (AI) using computed tomography. The age-adjusted incidence and mortality per 100 000 population were calculated using the Japanese population distribution model in 2015. The total incidence of AAD was 79 (type A: 64.5%, n = 51). Of those, 60.8% (31/51) of patients with type A and 21.4% (6/28) with type B were dead on arrival and diagnosed by AI. The 30-day mortality rates were 74.5% (38/51) in type A and 25.0% (7/28) in type B. The age-adjusted incidence and mortality of AAD per 100 000 inhabitants were 17.6 (type A: 11.3, type B: 6.2) and 9.9 (type A: 8.4, type B: 1.5), respectively. The population-based survey of AAD showed that the age-adjusted incidence of AAD was two-fold higher than in previous reports, and the actual mortality rates were markedly higher due to the high incidence of dead-on-arrival."

This cohort study obtained the data of previously published case reports from searches of PubMed (1990-2020), and adults with STEMI secondary to TAAAD were finally included. Delayed TTE (dTTE) exposure was defined as when the TTE test was made available after antithrombotic management for STEMI due to an initially missed diagnosis of TAAAD. The primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality, comparing individuals with dTTE and those with emergency TTE (eTTE).

Malpractice claims were analyzed to understand common reasons for litigation, medical specialties involved, patient injuries, and outcomes. Litigation cases in the Westlaw database from September 1st, 1987 to October 23 rd, 2019 were analyzed. Search terms included \"aortic aneurysm\" and \"aortic dissection.\" Data on plaintiff, defendant, litigation claims, patient injuries, misdiagnoses, and case outcomes were collected and compared for aortic aneurysms, aortic dissections, and overall cases. A total of 346 cases were identified, 196 involving aortic aneurysms and 150 aortic dissections. Physician defendants were emergency medicine (29%), cardiology (20%), internal medicine (14%), radiology (11%), cardiothoracic (10%) and vascular surgery (10%). Litigation claims included \"failure to diagnose and treat\" (61%), \"delayed diagnosis and treatment\" (21%), \"post-operative complications after open repair\" (10%) and \"negligent post-operative care\" (10%). Patients with aneurysms presented with abdominal (63%) and back pain (37%), while dissections presented with chest pain (78%), abdominal pain (15%), and shortness of breath (14%). Misdiagnoses included gastrointestinal (12%), other cardiovascular (9%), and musculoskeletal conditions (9%), but many were not specified (58%). Overall, 83% of cases were wrongful death suits. Injuries included loss of consortium (23%), emotional distress (19%), and bleeding (17%). In 53% of the cases, the jury ruled in favor of the defendant. 25% of cases ruled for the plaintiff. 22% of cases resulted in a settlement. The mean rewarded for each case was $1,644,590.66 (SD: $5,939,134.58; Range: $17,500-$68,035,462). For aortic pathologies, post-operative complications were not prominent among the reasons why suits were brought forth. This suggests improvements in education across all involved medical specialties may allow for improved diagnostic accuracy and efficient treatment, which could then translate to a decrease in associated litigation cases."

    "abstract": "Here, we describe a case of a 61-year-old male patient with acute type A aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta, aortic arch, descending aorta, and the abdominal aorta down to the iliac bifurcation with evidence of left common iliac artery occlusion. Computed tomography angiography revealed progressive dissection into the superior mesenteric artery and left renal artery with no clinical signs of mesenteric ischemia. Emergent ascending aortic reconstruction of the dissected aorta relieves the leg ischemia. On a postoperative day 9, the evolution was complicated by massive right hemothorax. Although the patient was hemodynamically stable after obtaining hemostasis, the patient developed paralytic ileus with a high elevated lactate level. Visceral malperfusion was not detected by exploratory laparotomy. Emergency abdominal aortic angiography revealed superior mesenteric artery intermittent occlusion, successfully treated by stenting implantation."

    "title": "Modular minimally invasive extracorporeal circulation ensures perfusion safety and technical feasibility in cardiac surgery; a systematic review of the literature.",
    "abstract": "Despite extensive evidence that shows clinical of superiority of MiECC, worldwide penetration remains low due to concerns regarding air handling and volume management in the context of a closed system. The purpose of this study is to thoroughly investigate perfusion safety and technical feasibility of performing all cardiac surgical procedures with modular (hybrid) MiECC, as experienced from the perfusionist's perspective. We retrospectively reviewed perfusion charts of consecutive adult patients undergoing all types of elective, urgent, and emergency cardiac surgery under modular MiECC. The primary outcome measure was perfusion safety and technical feasibility, as evidenced in the need for conversion from a closed to an open circuit. A systematic review of the literature was conducted aiming to ultimately clarify whether there are any safety issues regarding MiECC technology. We challenged modular MiECC use in a series of 403 consecutive patients of whom a significant proportion (111/403; 28%) underwent complex surgery including reoperations (4%), emergency repair of acute type A aortic dissection and composite aortic surgery (1.7%). Technical success rate was 100%. Conversion to an open circuit was required in 18/396 patients (4.5%), excluding procedures performed under circulatory arrest. Open configuration accounted for 40% ± 21% of total procedural perfusion time and was related to significant hemodilution and increase in peak lactate levels. Systematic review revealed that safety of the procedure challenged originated from a single report, while no clinical adverse event related to MiECC was identified. Use of modular MiECC secures safety and ensures technical feasibility in all cardiac surgical procedures. It represents a type III active closed system, while its stand-by component is reserved for a small (<5%) proportion of procedures and for a partial procedural time. Thus, it eliminates any safety concern regarding air handling and volume management, while it overcomes any unexpected intraoperative scenario."

    "abstract": "The incidence of pericardial effusion (PE) during radiofrequency catheter ablation (CA) for atrial fibrillation is approximately 1%. PE is a major complication during CA, but there has been limited literature about the perforation site responsible. This study aimed to retrospectively investigate the characteristics of the procedure and the patients in whom PE developed during CA. Of 1363 consecutive patients who underwent catheter ablation from January 2015 to June 2019 in Kyorin University Hospital, we reviewed patients who developed PE during CA. PE during CA occurred in 18 (1.32%) patients (median age, 71 [interquartile range (IQR) 65-77] years, 7 women). The median body mass index was 24 (IQR 20-27). Target arrhythmias for CA of patients with PE include atrial fibrillation (AF) (n = 13, 72%), premature ventricular contraction (n = 2, 11%), ventricular tachycardia (n = 1, 6%), atrial flutter (n = 1, 6%), and orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia (n = 1, 6%). Seventeen patients required pericardiocentesis, resulting in 300 (IQR 192.5-475) mL of drainage. Two patients required emergency surgical repair, and 1 died from aortic dissection. Based on the gas analysis, the drained blood was of venous origin in 47% of the total events and 54% of AF ablation. PE caused by a diagnostic catheter in the right heart is not uncommon, even in AF ablation."

    "abstract": "Acute Stanford type A aortic dissection (TAAD) is a life-threatening condition. Surgery is usually performed as a salvage procedure and is associated with significant postoperative early mortality and morbidity. Understanding the patient's conditions and treatment strategies which are associated with these adverse events is essential for an appropriate management of acute TAAD. Nineteen centers of cardiac surgery from seven European countries have collaborated to create a multicentre observational registry (ERTAAD), which will enroll consecutive patients who underwent surgery for acute TAAD from January 2005 to March 2021. Analysis of the impact of patient's comorbidities, conditions at referral, surgical strategies and perioperative treatment on the early and late adverse events will be performed. The investigators have developed a classification of the urgency of the procedure based on the severity of preoperative hemodynamic conditions and malperfusion secondary to acute TAAD. The primary clinical outcomes will be in-hospital mortality, late mortality and reoperations on the aorta. Secondary outcomes will be stroke, acute kidney injury, surgical site infection, reoperation for bleeding, blood transfusion and length of stay in the intensive care unit. The analysis of this multicentre registry will allow conclusive results on the prognostic importance of critical preoperative conditions and the value of different treatment strategies to reduce the risk of early adverse events after surgery for acute TAAD. This registry is expected to provide insights into the long-term durability of different strategies of surgical repair for TAAD. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04831073 ."

    "abstract": "This is a review of the underlying causes of the association of ST segment elevation and gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia, in patients who do not have chest pain. The review was based on anecdotal reports in Googlescholar and Pubmed using the search terms, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, ST elevation, myocardial infarction, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Those patients who did not have acute myocardial infarction as the cause of the association of ST segment elevation and gastrointestinal symptoms were compared with counterparts with similar symptoms who had well authenticated acute myocardial infarction or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as the underlying cause of ST segment elevation. The underlying causes of gastrointestinal symptoms which could be associated with ST segment elevation in the absence of either acute myocardial infarction or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy comprised pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, perforated gastric ulcer, intestinal obstruction, acute appendicitis, acute pancreatitis, acute cholecystitis, pheochromocytoma, bacterial meningitis, diabetic keto acidosis, and cannabis abuse. However, each of those disorders could also coexist either with acute myocardial infarction or with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The coexistence of ST segment elevation and gastrointestinal symptoms(without chest pain) was also documented in patients with esophageal perforation, mesenteric ischaemia, aortic dissection, Kounis syndrome, and in electrolyte disorders. In the context of presentation with gastroenterological symptoms but without concurrent chest pain, echocardiography appeared to be useful in distinguishing between \"pseudo\" myocardial infarction characterised by ST segment elevation in the absence of cardiac disease vs ST segment elevation attributable either to acute myocardial infarction or to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy."

    "abstract": "Objective: To examine the surgical treatment of Stanford type A aortic dissection (type A dissection) after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). Methods: The data of 58 patients with reoccurrence of type A dissection after TEVAR admitted into the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Henan Chest Hospital from February 2012 to January 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. There were 40 males and 18 females, aged (57.0±6.7) years (range: 31 to 71 years). The time between recurrence of type A dissection and TEVAR (M(QR)) was 37 days (72.8 months) (range: 1 h to 14 years). Forty-eight cases underwent emergency operation, 9 cases underwent sub-emergency operation, and 1 case died of dissection rupture on the way to the operating room. All 57 patients underwent radical treatment. Fifty-four cases underwent the frozen elephant trunk technique under deep hypothermia circulatory arrest and selective cerebral perfusion, and 3 cases (>65 years old) underwent arch debranch anastomosis+ascending aorta replacement+descending arch covered stent implantation under mild hypothermia. Results: The operation time was (445±32) minutes (range: 382 to 485 minutes), the aortic crossclamp time was (103±19) minutes (range: 89 to 133 minutes), the cardiopulmonary bypass time was (189±27) minutes (range: 162 to 221 minutes), and the intraoperative blood loss was (665±343) ml (range: 450 to 1 750 ml). Postoperative ICU stay time was 5 (6) days (range: 2 to 27 days), and postoperative hospital stay was 14.0 (4.5) days (range: 2 to 36 days). Three cases died, including 2 cases with severe brain complications and 1 case with systemic multiple organ failure caused by severe liver insufficiency and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Postoperative follow-up was 0.5 to 7.0 years, which showed that 1 case had left coronary artery anastomotic stoma fistula 3 months after operation and underwent reoperation, 2 cases underwent thoracoabdominal aortic replacement again, and the rest of patients had no anastomotic stoma fistula and incomplete stent distortion and expansion on CT angiography. Four cases died during follow-up, and 1 case died of sudden cerebral infarction 2 years after operation. Conclusion: The recurrent type A dissection after TEVAR is mostly related to stent graft, and the patients can undergo operation actively with good prognosis. 目的： 探讨胸主动脉腔内修复术（TEVAR）后再发Stanford A型主动脉夹层（A型夹层）的外科治疗经验。 方法： 回顾性分析2012年2月至2020年1月河南省胸科医院心血管外科收治的58例TEVAR术后再发A型夹层患者的资料。男性40例，女性18例，年龄（57.0±6.7）岁（范围：31~71岁）。术后再发A型夹层距TEVAR的时间［M（QR）］为37 d（72.8个月）（范围：1 h至14年）。48例急诊手术，9例亚急诊手术，1例转运至手术室途中因夹层破裂死亡。57例手术患者均行主动脉根部处理。54例于深低温停循环选择性脑灌注下行全弓置换，3例（年龄>65岁）于浅低温下行弓部去分支吻合+升主动脉置换+弓降部覆膜支架植入术。 结果： 手术时间（445±32）min（范围：382~485 min），主动脉阻断时间（103±19）min（范围：89~133 min），心肺转流时间（189±27）min（范围：162~221 min），术中出血量（665±343）ml（范围：450~1 750 ml）。术后ICU停留时间5（6）d（范围：2~27 d），术后住院时间14.0（4.5）d（范围：2~36 d）。死亡3例，包括严重脑部并发症2例，严重肝功能不全合并消化道出血导致全身多器官功能衰竭1例。术后随访0.5~7.0年，1例术后3个月发生左冠状动脉吻合口漏，行再次手术，2例再次行胸腹主动脉置换，其余患者CT血管造影未见吻合口漏和支架扭曲膨胀不全。4例随访期间死亡，1例术后2年突发脑梗死。 结论： TEVAR术后再发A型夹层多数与支架移植物相关，积极的外科手术可获得良好的预后。."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) is a \"can't miss\" diagnosis for emergency physicians. An algorithm combining the Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score (ADD-RS) with D-dimer has been proposed as a high-sensitivity clinical decision tool for AD that can determine the need for advanced imaging. Here we present a case of a 48-year-old male who presented to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain and dyspnea. He had an ADD-RS score of 0 and negative D-dimer, which placed him in the low-risk category not requiring further advanced imaging. Despite this, he was found to have a pericardial effusion and dilated aortic root on point-of-care transthoracic echocardiogram (POC-TTE). These findings increased suspicion for AD and prompted the emergency physician to order a computed tomography angiography (CTA), revealing a thoracic AD. The patient successfully underwent surgical repair. This case demonstrates that the ADD-RS + D-dimer algorithm would have erroneously ruled out AD, without the inclusion of indirect findings of AD from the POC-TTE. This highlights the value of using POC-TTE as an adjunct to the ADD-RS + D-dimer algorithm in the diagnostic evaluation of AD and how giving more weight to indirect signs of AD on POC-TTE could potentially increase the sensitivity of the combined ADD-RS + D-dimer + POC-TTE algorithm."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic syndrome (AAS) is an uncommon, life-threatening emergency that is frequently misdiagnosed. The 2020 Canadian clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis of AAS incorporate all available evidence into four key recommendations. In order to facilitate the implementation of these recommendations, a clinical decision aid was created. The objective of this study was to identify barriers and facilitators among physicians prior to implementation of the guideline recommendations in a multicentre step wedge cluster randomized control trial. We conducted semi-structured interviews with nine emergency room physicians working at five sites distributed between urban academic and rural settings. We used purposive sampling, contacting physicians until data saturation was reached. Interview questions were designed to understand potential barriers and facilitators to guideline recommendation uptake and use. Responses were analysed according to the Theoretical Domains Framework, and overarching themes describing these barriers and facilitators were identified. Two themes and six subthemes encompassing 13 theoretical domains were identified. These included clinical decision-making support, awareness of the evidence, social factors, expected consequences, ability of physicians to acquire the necessary data and ease of use. A majority of interviewees anticipated that the guideline recommendations would support clinical decision making and more effectively risk-stratify patients. Other facilitators included endorsement of the guidelines by professional organizations and peers. Barriers to implementation include the fact that laboratory testing and knowledge of the rationale for its use in the investigation of AAS were not widespread. The complexity of the clinical decision aid and concerns about test specificity were also identified as potential barriers to use. Physicians were amenable to using the AAS guideline recommendations to support clinical decision-making and to reduce resource use. A structured intervention should be developed to address the identified barriers and leverage the facilitators in order to ensure successful implementation. Our findings may have implications for the implementation of other guidelines used in emergency departments."

    "abstract": "Fenestrated/branched endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (F/B-EVAR) is widely accepted technique to treat juxta/pararenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (J/P-AAAs) and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs) for patients at high-surgical risk. However, the follow-up results should be carefully evaluated, especially in terms of the reintervention rate. The aim of the present study was, therefore, to evaluate the early and mid-term reinterventions after FB-EVAR for J/P-AAAs and TAAAs and their effects on follow-up survival. From 2006 to 2019, all consecutive patients who had undergone F/B-EVAR for J/P-AAAs or TAAAs were prospectively enrolled. Cases requiring reinterventions were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with aortic dissection were excluded from the present analysis. Reinterventions were classified as follows: access related, aortoiliac related, or target visceral vessel (TVV) related. Freedom from reintervention and survival were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine the risk factors. Overall, 221 F/B-EVAR procedures were performed for 111 J/P-AAAs (50.3%) and 110 TAAAs (49.7%) in an elective (182; 82%) or urgent (39; 18%) setting. The median follow-up was 27 months (interquartile range, 13 months). Overall, 41 patients had undergone 52 reinterventions (single, 30 [14%]; multiple, 11 [5%]; access related, 17 [33%]; aortoiliac related, 6 [12%]; TVV related, 29 [55%]). Of the 52 reinterventions, 32 (62%) and 20 (38%) had occurred within and after 30 days, respectively. Eight reinterventions (15%) had been were performed in an urgent setting. Endovascular and open reinterventions were performed in 32 (62%) and 20 (38%) cases, respectively. Open reinterventions were frequently access related (access, 16; no access, 4; P ≤ .001). Technical success was 95% (39 patients); failures consisted of one splenic artery rupture and one renal artery loss. Patients undergoing reintervention had more frequently undergone a primary urgent F/B-EVAR (urgent, 12 of 39 [31%]; elective, 29 of 182 [16%]; P < .001) and had had TAAAs (TAAAs, 34 of 41 [83%]; J/P-AAAs, 7 of 41 [17%]; P < .001). The patients with TAAAs had had a greater incidence of TVV-related reintervention (TAAAs, 26 of 28 [93%]; J/P-AAAs, 2 of 28 [7%]; P < .001) and multiple reinterventions (TAAAs, 9 of 11 [82%]; J/P-AAAs, 2 of 11 [18%]; P = .03) compared with those with J/P-AAAs. Survival at 3 years was 75%. Freedom from reintervention was 81% at 3 years. Patients who had undergone reinterventions had lower 3-year survival (reintervention, 61%; no reintervention, 77%; P = .02). Preoperative chronic renal failure (hazard ratio [HR], 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-3.6; P = .02), TAAAs (HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1-4.8; P = .03), and urgent primary F/B-EVAR procedures (HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.2-4.9; P = .01) were independent predictors of late mortality. Reinterventions after F/B-EVAR are not uncommon and were related to TVVs in only one half of cases. Most of them can be performed in an elective setting using endovascular techniques. The technical success rate was excellent. Reinterventions were more frequent after TAAAs and urgent F/B-EVAR procedures and had a significant effect on overall survival in these situations."

    "abstract": "Objectives: Acute type A aortic dissection (aTAAD) is usually lethal without emergency surgery. Although veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) is widely used in patients with cardiogenic shock following cardiac surgery, VA-ECMO support following aTAAD surgery has not been well-described. Based on our 6-year experience, we aimed to retrospectively analyze risk factors, application and timing of VA-ECMO, and outcomes in aTAAD patients. Methods: In this retrospective, single-center study, we enrolled adult patients who underwent aTAAD surgery from January 2014 to December 2019 and were supported with VA-ECMO. Patients were divided into two groups according to whether or not they were successfully weaned from VA-ECMO. Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative variables were assessed and analyzed. Outcomes of the patients were followed up until discharge. Results: Twenty-seven patients who received aTAAD surgery with VA-ECMO support were included in the study. Nine patients (33.3%) were successfully weaned from VA-ECMO. The median VA-ECMO support time and length of hospital stay in the successfully weaned group were significantly longer than in the group could not be successfully weaned (192 [111-327] vs. 55 [23-95] h, p < 0.01; 29 [18-40] vs. 4 [3-8] days, p < 0.01). Overall in-hospital mortality was 81.5%. The main causes of death were bleeding (37%), neurological complications (15%), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (15%). Preoperative levels of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) were lower in patients who were successfully weaned from VA-ECMO than in the failed group (14 [6-30] vs. 55 [28-138] U/L, p < 0.01). Postoperative peak levels of CK-MB, cardiac troponin T, lactate dehydrogenase, and lactate were significantly lower in the successful group than in the failed group. Conclusion: Postoperative VA-ECMO support was rarely used in aTAAD patients. Our study showed that VA-ECMO can be considered as a salvage treatment in aTAAD patients, despite the high rate of complications and mortality."

    "abstract": "Type A aortic dissection (TAAD) involves the ascending aorta or the arch. Acute TAAD usually requires urgent replacement of the ascending aorta. However, a subset of these patients develops aortic rupture due to further dilatation of the residual dissected aorta. There is currently no reliable means to predict the risk of dilatation following TAAD repair. In this study, we performed a comprehensive morphological and hemodynamic analysis for patients with and without progressive aortic dilatation following surgical replacement of the ascending aorta. Patient-specific models of repaired TAAD were reconstructed from post-surgery computed tomography images for detailed computational fluid dynamic analysis. Geometric and hemodynamic parameters were evaluated and compared between patients with stable aortic diameters (N = 9) and those with aortic dilatation (N = 8). Our results showed that the number of re-entry tears and true/false lumen pressure difference were significantly different between the two groups. Patients with progressive aortic dilatation had higher luminal pressure difference (6.7 [4.6, 10.9] vs. 0.9 [0.5, 2.3] mmHg; P = 0.001) and fewer re-entry tears (1.5 [1, 2.8] vs. 5 [3.3, 7.5]; P = 0.02) compared to patients with stable aortic diameters, suggesting that these factors may serve as potential predictors of aneurysmal dilatation following surgical repair of TAAD."

    "abstract": "Since the first endovascular aortic repair in 1990, endovascular devices and the indications for their use have significantly grown. Considerable progress has been made in endovascular devices and techniques, such that endovascular repair is now considered first-line treatment for patients with descending aortic disease. However, for patients with ascending aortic disease, open surgical repair with cardiopulmonary bypass and hypothermic cardiac arrest was the only option until recently. Although the outcomes for open surgical repair of the ascending aorta have improved over the years, approximately 30% of patients with an emergent surgical indication, such as type A aortic dissection, are considered to be too high risk for open repair. For these patients, endovascular repair of the ascending aorta offers a life-saving procedure. The ascending aorta is regarded as the final frontier for endovascular therapy. Endovascular repair of it has posed a formidable challenge thus far, due to its unique anatomy, hemodynamic forces, and lack of an appropriate stent-graft designed specifically for the ascending aorta. Although currently there are no comprehensive data from randomized clinical trials, there are several case series and case reports that have shown favorable outcomes. Improvements in available devices soon will drive an exponential increase in the number of patients undergoing endovascular ascending aortic repair. In this review, the authors discuss multiple aspects of endovascular ascending aortic repair including the unique surgical and anesthetic considerations, the devices used, and the available outcomes data, and future directions are also explored."

Patient mortality, survival and reoperation rate. Demographic data, cardiovascular risk factors, specific data by indication, technical resources and postoperative complications. A total of 135 urgent TEVARs were included (111 men, mean age 60.4 ± 16.3 years): 43 ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysms (31.9%), 54 type B dissections (40%) and 32 traumatic aortic injuries (23.7%), and other etiologies 4.4%. The overall mortality rate at 30 days was 18.5%, and proved higher in the RTAA group (27.9%). The mean actuarial survival rate was 67 ± 6% at 5 years. The postoperative stroke rate was 5.2%, and the paraplegia rate was 5.9%. Aortic reoperations proved necessary in 12 patients (9%). Emergency descending thoracic aortic diseases can be treated by endovascular techniques with optimal results and low morbidity and mortality - though the figures are slightly higher than in elective cases.

We performed this retrospective cohort study to explore the weekend effect in four major cardiovascular emergencies in Taiwan. The Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) claims database between 2005 and 2015 was used. We extracted 3811 incident cases of ruptured aortic aneurysm, 184,769 incident cases of acute myocardial infarction, 492,127 incident cases of ischemic stroke, and 15,033 incident cases of pulmonary embolism from 9,529,049 patients having at least one record of hospitalization in the NHI claims database within 2006 ~ 2014. Patients were classified as weekends or weekdays admission groups. Dates of in-hospital mortality and one-year mortality were obtained from the Taiwan National Death Registry. We found no difference in in-hospital mortality between weekend group and weekday group in patients with ruptured aortic aneurysm (45.4% vs 45.3%, adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87-1.17, p = 0.93), patients with acute myocardial infarction (15.8% vs 16.2%, adjusted OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.95-1.00, p = 0.10), patients with ischemic stroke (4.1% vs 4.2%, adjusted OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.96-1.03, p = 0.71), and patients with pulmonary embolism (14.6% vs 14.6%, adjusted OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.92-1.15, p = 0.66).

    "abstract": "Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the exclusion of a patient from COVID-19 should be performed before surgery. However, patients with type A acute aortic dissection (AAD) during pregnancy can seriously endanger the health of either the mother or fetus that requires emergency surgical treatment without the test for COVID-19. A 38-year-old woman without Marfan syndrome was admitted to the hospital because of chest pain in the 34th week of gestation. She has diagnosed as having a Stanford type-A AAD involving an aortic arch and descending aorta via aortic computed tomographic angiography. The patient was transferred to the isolated negative pressure operating room in one hour and underwent cesarean delivery and ascending aorta replacement. All medical staff adopted third-level medical protection measures throughout the patient transfer and surgical procedure. After surgery, the patient was transferred to the isolated negative pressure intensive care unit ward. The nucleic acid test and anti-COVID-19 immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM were performed and were negative. The patient and infant were discharged without complication nine days later and recovered uneventfully. The results indicated that the procedure that we used is feasible in patients with a combined cesarean delivery and surgery for Stanford type-A AAD during the COVID-19 outbreak, which was mainly attributed to rapid multidisciplinary consultation, collaboration, and quick decision-making."

We included 115 consecutive patients in this study. A total of 53.0% (n = 61) of patients had acute kidney injury. The mean age was 47.8 ± 10.7 years, and 25.2% were women. Mean body mass index was 26.2 ± 3.9 kg/m2. The results of a univariate analysis showed that BMI, eGFR, CPB time, operative time, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative amount of PRBCs, and respiratory failure were significantly correlated with AKI. In-hospital mortality was obviously increased in the acute kidney injury group (13.1% vs 1.9%; P = 0.025). Multivariate logistic regression showed that body mass index was associated with postoperative acute kidney injury after adjusting for other confounding factors (odds ratio = 1.16; 95% confidence interval: 1.02-1.33; P = 0.0288). The risk of postoperative AKI in the BMI ≥ 24 kg/m2 group was increased by 2.35 times (OR = 3.35, 95% CI: 1.15-9.74; p = 0.0263). Body mass index was an independent predictor of acute kidney injury after urgent aortic total arch replacement surgery with a frozen elephant trunk implant."

    "title": "Aortic dissection diagnosed on stroke computed tomography protocol: a case report.",
    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is one of the causes of stroke. Because cerebral infarction with aortic dissection is a contraindication to intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) therapy, exclusion of aortic dissection is necessary prior to its administration. However, imaging takes time to provide a diagnosis, possibly causing delays in surgical treatment. A 65-year-old Japanese female patient was transported to the hospital for a suspected stroke, with back pain and left upper and lower extremity palsy which occurred while eating. Upon arrival at the hospital, the left lower limb paralysis had improved, but the left upper limb paralysis remained. Right back pain had also developed. A plain head computed tomography (CT) scan performed 110 minutes after onset showed no acute bleeding or infarction. Subsequent CT perfusion (CTP) showed acute perfusion disturbance in the right hemisphere without infarction, known as ischemic penumbra. The four-dimensional maximum-intensity projection image reconstructed from CTP showed a delayed enhancement at the right internal carotid and right middle cerebral arteries compared to the contralateral side, suggesting a proximal vascular lesion. Contrast helical CT from the neck to abdomen revealed an acute aortic dissection of Stanford type A with false lumen patency. The dissection extended to the proximal right common carotid artery. The patient underwent an emergency total arch replacement and open stent graft. After recovering well, the patient was ambulatory upon discharge from the hospital. The combination of plain head CT, CTP, and helical CT scan from the neck to abdomen enabled us to evaluate for stroke and aortic dissection within a short amount of time, allowing for early therapeutic intervention. When acute stroke is suspected due to neurological deficits, plain head CT is the first choice for imaging diagnosis. The addition of cervical CT angiography can reliably exclude stroke due to aortic dissection. CTP can identify ischemic penumbra, which cannot be diagnosed by plain head CT or diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. These combined stroke CT protocols helped us avoid missing an aortic dissection."

    "abstract": "Objective: To confirm the impact of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) on perioperative and long-term outcome in patients with Stanford type A aortic dissection. Methods: From June 2010 to July 2017, the clinical data of 91 patients with Stanford type A aortic dissection were analyzed. Among them, 51 patients with OSAHS were included in the study group and 40 patients without OSAHS were included in the control group. After 36 months follow-up, all-cause death was regarded as the end event. The clinical baseline data, perioperative period and 36 months survival rate of the two groups were compared. Kanplan-Meier method was used to describe the 36 month survival curve of the two groups. Cox proportional risk model was used to evaluate the risk ratio (HR) and 95%CI of 36 month survival rate. Results: The mortality rate during hospitalization was 5.9% (3 cases) in the study group and 5.0% (2 cases) in the control group, and the difference was not statistically significant (χ~2=0.03, P>0.05). The actual follow-up was (36.2±1.5) months, 88 cases were followed up and 3 cases were lost. The all cause mortality rate of 36 months was 27.5% (14/51)in the study group and 10.0%(4/40) in the control group, the difference was statistically significant (χ~2=4.30, P<0.05).By Cox proportional risk model analysis, 36 months after operation, the study group was compared with the control group after adjusting for age, male, bicuspid of aortic valve, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, anemia, preoperative pericardial tamponade, postoperative organ dysfunction, preoperative LVEF, emergency operation, Sun's operation, coronary artery bypass grafting, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia, and advanced avulsion of distal aortic dissection The survival rate was lower, the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05).In addition to OSAHS, coronary artery bypass grafting and preoperative pericardial tamponade were also risk factors for the increase of 36 month mortality rate (HR=11.28,95%CI: 1.98-46.25, P=0.009; HR=9.08, 95%CI: 2.22-41.3, P=0.032). Conclusions: There was no significant difference in mortality during hospitalization in patients with Stanford A aortic dissection combined with OSAHS. The survival rate of 36 months after operation was lower than that of the control group. 目的： 探讨阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停低通气综合征（OSAHS）对Stanford A型主动脉夹层围手术期及3年全因死亡率的影响。 方法： 前瞻性纳入2010年6月至2017年7月于青岛市市立医院心脏病中心接受手术治疗的Stanford A型主动脉夹层患者91例，其中男性67例，女性24例，年龄44~69（56.4±12.8）岁。91例患者中，合并OSAHS的患者51例，被纳入研究组，不伴OSAHS的患者40例，被纳入对照组。随访观察36个月，将全因死亡作为终点事件。采用卡方检验对比分析两组术前及术中的临床基线资料，以Kanplan-Meier法描述两组术后36个月的生存曲线，应用Cox比例风险模型评估术后36个月生存率的风险比（HR）及其95%可信区间（CI）。 结果： 患者住院期间死亡率在研究组为5.9%（3例），对照组为5.0%（2例），差异无统计学意义（χ~20.03，P>0.05）。实际随访（36.2±1.5）个月，88例完成随访，3例失随访。36个月全因死亡率在研究组为27.5%（14/51），对照组为10.0%（4/40），差异有统计学意义（χ~2=4.30，P<0.05）。经Cox比例风险模型分析，在调整年龄、男性、主动脉瓣二叶化畸形、慢性阻塞性肺疾病、贫血、术前心包填塞、术后脏器功能不全、术前左室射血分数、急诊手术、孙氏手术、冠状动脉旁路移植、高血压、心律失常、主动脉远端夹层进展撕裂后，与对照组相比，研究组的术后36个月生存率更低（P<0.05）。除OSAHS之外，冠状动脉旁路移植、术前心包填塞也是36个月死亡率升高的危险因素（HR=11.28，95%CI为2.18~46.25，P<0.01；HR=9.08，95%CI为2.22~41.3，P<0.05）。 结论： 合并OSAHS的Stanford A型主动脉夹层患者，术后住院期间死亡率无明显差异，术后36个月生存率较对照组降低。."

    "title": "Case Report: Are We Witnessing an Increase of Chronic Ascending Aortic Dissection as a Collateral Effect to the COVID-19 Pandemic?",
    "abstract": "Background: The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic is reducing health care accessibility to non-life-threatening diseases, thus hiding their real incidence. Moreover, the incidence of potentially fatal conditions such as acute type A aortic dissection seems to have decreased since the pandemic began, whereas the number of cases of chronic ascending aortic dissections dramatically increased. We present two patients whose management has been affected by the exceptional sanitary situation we are dealing with. Case report: A 70-year-old man with chest pain and an aortic regurgitation murmur had his cardiac workup delayed (4 months) because of sanitary restrictions. He was then diagnosed with chronic type A aortic dissection and underwent urgent replacement of ascending aorta and aortic root. The delay in surgical treatment made the intervention technically challenging because the ascending aorta grew up to 80 mm inducing strong adhesions and chronic inflammation. The second case report concerns a 68-year-old woman with right lower-limb pain who was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis. However, a CT scan to exclude a pulmonary embolism could not be realized until 5 months later because of sanitary restrictions. When she eventually got the CT scan, it fortuitously showed a chronic dissection of the ascending aorta. She underwent urgent surgery, and the intervention was challenging because of adhesions and severe inflammation. Conclusion: Delayed treatment due to sanitary restrictions related to COVID-19 pandemic is having a significant impact on the management of potentially life-threatening conditions including type A aortic dissection. We should remain careful to avoid COVID-19 also hitting patients who are not infected with the virus."

Our patient presented to the emergency center with dizziness and fall for which he was evaluated and treated for hypertension. Two weeks later, he again presented to the hospital with painless right groin swelling: computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen incidentally showed type B AD. The patient might have an AD presenting with dizziness and hypertension during previous presentation. From this case, we learn how it is challenging to diagnose painless AD especially when patient comes with atypical symptoms.

The aim of this study is to analyze the incidence, indications and influence in-hospital outcomes of AAAD repair requiring concomitant CABG in a high-volume single-center experience. Retrospective study of all consecutive AAAD patients. Those who underwent concomitant CABG were identified. Preoperative, intraoperative, postoperative and follow-up data were collected and analyzed. Between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2016, 382 patients underwent emergency surgery for AAAD. Forty-one (10.7%) underwent concomitant CABG. In this group, mean age was 64 ± 14 years, 32 were male (78%). Indication for CABG was coronary dissection in 28 patients (68.3%), post-cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) right heart failure in 7 (17.1%), post CPB left heart failure in (7.3%) and native coronary pathology in 3 (7.3%). In 33 (80.5%) one graft was needed, in 7 (17%) two were performed and in 1 patient (2.4%) 3 were necessary. The right coronary artery (RCA) was the only revascularized vessel in 26 cases (63.4%), the left coronary artery (LCA) alone in 11 (26.8%), and both coronary systems in 4 (9.8%). In-hospital mortality was 51.2% (N = 21); eight (19.5%) patients had postoperative myocardial infarction (MI) and 11 (26.8%) had a major neurological event. Multivariable logistic regression identified concomitant CABG as a predictor of in-hospital mortality (Odds Ratio (OR) = 3.8115, 95% CI= 0.514-2.138, p = 0.001).

He immediately underwent pericardial fluid drainage and was transferred to the operation theatre. Pericardiotomy was performed and hemorrhage from the right atrium was found. Then, a mass of 35 mm in diameter was also detected by transesophageal echocardiography. Resection of the right atrial tumor was performed under cardiopulmonary bypass. A bovine pericardial patch was used for the repair of the defect in the right atrium. The pathological diagnosis was cardiac hemangioma with no malignant signs."

    "abstract": "We examined the long-term fate of the preserved aortic root after emergent repair of acute Type A aortic dissection. 144 patients (60% males, mean age 60.5 years) underwent supracoronary ascending aortic replacement for acute Type A aortic dissection. Long-term survival, as well as growth, reoperation, and adverse events of the aortic root (rupture, pseudoaneurysm, and persistent dissection) were retrospectively assessed. Operative mortality was 9%, and overall survival at 1, 5, and 10 years was 87.8%, 76.4%, and 64.6%, respectively. Reoperation on the proximal aorta was performed in 16 patients (12.2%) within a median of 2.45 years post-operatively. Indications were severe aortic insufficiency (AI) (n = 6), aortic root pseudoaneurysm (n = 8), pseudoaneurysm with severe AI (n = 1), and persistent dissection with severe AI (n = 1). The aortic root grew at 0.2mm/year (interquartile range 0-0.8). Among survivors (n = 131), 28 patients (21.3%) reached aortic root diameter ≥ 45 mm (mean diameter 47.6 mm, range 45-54 mm). Survival free from proximal aortic reoperation at 1, 5, and 10 years was 96.6%, 94.5%, and 92.2%, respectively. No non-reoperated patient-despite persistent, unoperated enlargement or distortion or pseudoaneurysm of the aortic root-developed free rupture or fistula to a cardiac chamber. Root-sparing ascending aortic replacement for acute Type-A aortic dissection showed satisfactory long-term outcomes with relatively low rates of re-intervention or serious aortic root adverse events despite dilatation and irregularity of aortic root contour. Dense adhesions from prior surgery, proximal aortic suture line, and Teflon felt seem to discourage free rupture or fistulization."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) and non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are two of the most life-threatening diseases encountered in the emergency department (ED), but there are no rapid and reliable tools for differentiation. The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a nomogram that incorporates both the clinical characteristics and bedside laboratory tests available to differentiate between AD and non-ST segment elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS). Between January 2016 and July 2018, patients with AD and NSTE-ACS were enrolled and divided into training and validation groups. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was used to select the factors with significant value of predicting the diagnosis of AD. A nomogram was built on the basis of multivariable logistic regression analysis. Area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the calibration curve were used to assess the performance of the nomogram. Decision curve analysis was performed to assess the clinical utility of the nomogram. A final cohort of 263 patients (94 patients with AD and 169 patients with NSTE-ACS) were enrolled. Six variables were incorporated in the nomogram: pain severity, tearing pain, pulse asymmetry, electrocardiogram (ECG), D-dimer level and troponin I level. The AUC of the nomogram to predict the probability of AD was 0.919 (95% CI, 0.876-0.962) in the training group and 0.938 (95% CI, 0.888-0.989) in the validation group. The calibration curve demonstrated a good consistency between the actual clinical results and the predicted outcomes. The decision curve analysis indicated that the nomogram had higher overall net benefits in predicting AD in both the training group and the validation group. We developed and validated a predictive nomogram that could be used as a tool to differentiate AD from NSTE-ACS rapidly and accurately."

    "abstract": "We performed a multicenter prospective comparative study to determine the impact of a Japanese frozen elephant trunk device on total arch replacement compared with conventional repair without it. Between 2016 and 2019, a total of 684 patients (frozen elephant trunk procedure; n = 369; conventional repair, n = 315) from 41 institutions were enrolled. The 2 procedures were selected according to each center's strategy. The frozen elephant trunk procedure was applied more for aortic dissection, whereas the conventional repairs were predominantly performed for aneurysms. In the former, only hypothermic circulatory arrest time was reduced among the intraoperative parameters. Although there were no differences in the 30-day and in-hospital mortality rates (0.8% and 1.6%, respectively, for the frozen elephant trunk procedure vs 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively, for conventional repair), the neurologic complication rates were significantly higher in stroke (5.7% vs 2.2%; P = .022) and paraplegia (1.6% vs 0%; P = .023). In the propensity score matching analyses using 11 variables, statistical significance disappeared in the differences for mortality and neurologic morbidity (stroke and paraplegia/paraparesis) rates of 194 patients of each group, although they were still higher for the frozen elephant trunk procedure. The early outcomes of total arch replacement with the frozen elephant trunk procedure were acceptable despite its higher prevalence of emergency or redo surgery, which was comparable to that of the conventional repair. This procedure had higher rates of spinal cord injury than the conventional repair, which is a disadvantage of this approach."

    "title": "Short- and long-term outcomes of aortic root-sparing repair and replacement in acute type A aortic dissection repair.",
    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection is a surgical emergency with a high mortality rate if left untreated. Management of the aortic root in this setting constitutes an intricate decision-making framework, further complicated by the emergent nature of the dissection. There exists much controversy regarding pursuit of the aggressive aortic root replacement versus a conservative root-sparing repair, alongside considerations for valve-sparing root replacement. In this review, we critically appraise the current controversy in the literature considering the fate of the aortic root, discussing the aforementioned root interventions for which provides better outcomes for mortality and risk of re-intervention. Literature search was performed using electronic database through PubMed, Google scholar, and Embase focussing on studies reporting outcomes and re-intervention rates for these approaches. Limited by the heterogeneity in surgical strategy, with most studies being single-centred retrospective experiences, further fuel this ongoing debate. The literature reveals rather contrasting results whilst comparing root-sparing repair, versus the extensive root replacement; whilst some studies report no statistically significant difference, others show one superior over the other. There is greater consensus when considering risk of re-operation, with studies showing higher rates of re-operation in root-sparing group compared to replacement; however, many others show no statistically significant difference. In conclusion, the conflicting outcomes reported in the literature, with their inherent limitations, results in the current inability to reach a definitive answer. There remains support in the current literature for both approaches with much of the decision-making being surgeon-bound with many significant influencing factors on a case-by-case basis."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection can result in devastating cerebral, visceral, renal, spinal, and extremity ischemia. We describe the management and outcomes of patients presenting with aortic dissection and lower extremity malperfusion (LEM). A single-center institutional aortic database was queried for patients with aortic dissection and LEM from 2011 to 2019. The primary end point was resolution of LEM after aortic repair. Secondary end points were amputation, in-hospital mortality, time to intervention, and postoperative complications. Of 769 patients with aortic dissection, 42 (5.5%) presented acutely with LEM: 16 with Stanford type A and 26 Stanford type B aortic dissection (age 55 ± 13 years; 90% men). Most presented as Rutherford IIB symptoms, but patients with type A had Rutherford III more often, compared with those with type B. Aortic repair was performed before limb interventions in 36 patients (86%; 19 TEVAR, 16 open arch and ascending repair, and 1 open descending aortic repair with fenestration). Seven (19%) had immediate failure with persistent malperfusion recognized in the operating room and underwent additional limb intervention, including extra-anatomic revascularization (n = 4), iliac stenting (n = 2), and femoral patch with septal fenestration or tacking (n = 2). Three patients (8%) had early delayed failure requiring extra-anatomic bypass in two and amputation in one. In contrast, six patients had limb-first intervention with extra-anatomic revascularization. None had immediate failure, but one-half had early delayed failure requiring proximal aortic intervention: two TEVAR and one open aortic fenestration. Limb-first patients were more likely to have early delayed failure compared with aortic dissection treated first patients (50% vs 8%; P = .029). The amputation rate was 2%, occurring in one type A patient. The overall in-hospital mortality was 7% (n = 3), with no difference between type A and type B aortic dissection. There was no difference in surgical site infection, postoperative dialysis need, stroke, and myocardial infarction. In patients presenting with acute aortic dissection with limb ischemia, resolution of the malperfusion occurs in the majority of cases after primary aortic dissection intervention, emphasizing the usefulness of urgent TEVAR for complicated type B and open repair of type A before lower extremity intervention. Limb-first interventions have a higher early delayed failure rate and thus require more frequent reoperation. However, the overall amputation rate in LEM owing to aortic dissection remains low."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (AAAD) is considered a fatal disease which requires an emergent surgical intervention. This study focuses onthe neurological outcome after surgical repair in cases of AAAD in comparison between elderly and young patients. a retrospective analysis of 368 consecutive patients who underwent emergency surgery of ascending aorta in moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest (MHCA) (20-24 °C) and antegrade cerebral perfusion after AAAD between 2001 and 2016. Patients were divided into two groups: those aged 75 years and older (68 (18.5%)) and those younger than 75 years (300 (81.5%)). Comparing both groups, average age was 79.0 ± 3.2 vs. 59.2 ± 10.7 years (p < 0.001); female gender represents 58.8% of elderly patients vs. 28.7% in younger patients (p < 0.001). Intraoperatively, cardiopulmonary bypass time (155 min (131; 187) vs. 171 min (137; 220); p = 0.012), cross-clamping time (79 min (60; 105) vs. 93 min (71; 134); p = 0.001] and circulatory arrest time (29 min (22; 40) vs. 33 min (26; 49); p = 0.011) were significantly shorter in elderly than younger group. Postoperatively, there was no significant difference in delirium (11.8% vs. 20.5%; p = 0.0968) or stroke (11.8% vs. 16.1%; p = 0.369). The 30-day mortality was satisfactory for both groups but significantly higher in the elderly group (27.9% vs. 14.3%; p = 0.007). The current study concluded that surgical treatment of AAAD in elderly patients can be applied safely without increasing risk of neurological complication. However, minimizing operation time may help limit the occurrence of postoperative neurological complication."

    "title": "The effect of hemoadsorption on rivaroxaban blood plasma concentration in emergency cardiac surgery.",
    "abstract": "Hemoadsorption was used in a 59-year-old patient with an acute type A aortic dissection, who was on rivaroxaban and dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid. Our aim was to expeditiously remove rivaroxaban preoperatively. After 8 h of hemoadsorption, the rivaroxaban blood plasma concentration (RBPC) did not decrease below 42.1 μg/l. Intraoperatively, hemoadsorption was repeated during extracorporeal circulation. Sixteen hours after surgery and a total of 13 h of hemoadsorption, the RBPC was 40.1 μg/l. Thereafter, the RBPC spontaneously decreased to 24.7 μg/l within 14 h. In our patient, hemoadsorption may have enhanced rivaroxaban removal at higher RBPC (cutoff value 40-50 μg/l). At lower RBPC, the removal of rivaroxaban may depend solely on the natural drug elimination process. The evolution of the RBPC under hemoadsorption in vivo warrants a thorough investigation. Further clinical studies are required to assess the effectiveness and limitations of hemoadsorption to preclude a fatal bleeding event in patients with rivaroxaban in need of major emergency surgery."

    "abstract": "This case report details familial aortic dissection in 2 second-degree blood relatives who experienced sudden aortic dissections. One patient underwent emergency computed tomography angiography (CTA) and the other underwent magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). These imaging examinations were instrumental in revealing each patient's condition. One patient died of dissection rupture while being prepped for surgery. The other patient underwent surgery, recovered, and undergoes continual monitoring for the condition. A positive family history of aortic dissection should be considered in patients presenting with aortic emergencies. Many genes can contribute to this condition, with most genes relating to smooth muscle and connective tissue disorders. Imaging studies for evaluating and monitoring aortic dissection include transesophageal echocardiography, CTA, and MRA. Surgical treatment is possible for aortic dissection, with the goals being to stabilize the dissection and reduce the possibility of rupture. The mortality rate for aortic dissection is high, with the main cause of death being dissection rupture. Lifelong monitoring of survivors and first-degree relatives is recommended."

    "abstract": "Dissection of the ascending aorta (AA) represents a life-threatening condition typically treated by emergent surgical repair. A rare, potential complication of AA dissection is pulmonary artery (PA) sheath hematoma. Due to the presence of a common adventitial layer between the proximal AA and the PA, dissection can propagate between both vessels, potentially compromising the PA lumen. The resultant acute narrowing of the PA lumen may abruptly increase right ventricular (RV) afterload. Recognition of PA sheath hematoma is important; when seen on echocardiography it is suggestive of AA dissection and has the potential to result in RV hypertension and dysfunction if significant PA compression occurs."

    "abstract": "The mid-term and long-term efficacies of valve preservation in acute DeBakey I aortic dissection (AD) are controversial. Thus, it is unclear whether middle-aged patients with acute DeBakey I AD should undergo modified valve-sparing procedures or the Bentall procedure in an emergency setting. This study included 213 middle-aged Chinese patients (under 60 years old) who were treated for acute DeBakey I AD between January 2009 and June 2015. The treatments involved modified valve-sparing aortic root replacement (VSARR) (117 patients) or the Bentall procedure (96 patients). Preoperative, intraoperative, postoperative, and follow-up data were analyzed. Echocardiography and thoracoabdominal computed tomography angiography (CTA) findings were reviewed at 3 months, 1 year, and then annually after surgery. No significant differences were observed in terms of the preoperative, intraoperative, in-hospital mortality, and postoperative parameters. There were also no significant differences in aortic regurgitation (AR). However, follow-up examinations using CTA revealed that 6 patients had endoleakage at the distal end of the triple-branched stent (0/110 patients [0.0%] vs. 6/90 patients [6.7%], P = 0.022). The anticoagulation-related thromboembolism/bleeding events was significantly lower in group A than in group B (0/110 patients [0.0%] vs. 11/90 patients [11.1%], P = 0.001). And postoperative aortic valve re-operation rate was significantly lower in group A (1/110 patients [0.9%] vs. 8/90 patients [8.9%], P = 0.020). There was no significant difference in survival during the follow-up period (log-rank P > 0.05). For middle-aged patients with acute DeBakey I AD, VSARR were associated with a lower rate of endoleakage at the distal end of the triple-branched stent, thromboembolism/bleeding events and aortic valve re-operation (vs. the Bentall procedure)."

    "title": "[Efficacy of endovascular treatment of distal aortic dissection involving abdominal visceral segment with bare-metal stents related technique].",
    "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the effect of bare-metal stent related technique on distal aortic dissection involving abdominal visceral segment. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on clinical data of 33 patients with distal aortic dissection involved abdominal visceral segment, who hospitalized in the Vascular Surgery Department of Shanghai Changhai Hospital from July 2012 to September 2019. The effect of the treatment was evaluated according to the clinical and preoperative, intraoperative and follow-up imaging data derived from (aorta computed tomography angiography (CTA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA)) as well as the changes of the maximal diameter of the aorta and the thrombosis of the false lumen of the dissection. The criteria were as follows: the maximum diameter change of aortic dissection<5 mm was defined as stable; the maximum diameter decrease of aortic dissection≥5 mm was defined as effective reduction; the maximum diameter increase of aortic dissection≥5 mm was defined as expansion; the definition of diameter change of false lumen was the same as above. The hospital complications, clinical symptoms and survival were recorded. Results: There were 28 male patients in this cohort, the mean age was (57.6±4.9) years old. Twenty-one patients were treated with bare-metal stent and coils technique, of which 8 patients were jointly treated with stent grafts. Twelve patients were treated with multi-layer bare-metal stent technique, of which 4 patients were jointly treated with stent grafts. Intraoperative DSA image results showed that the visceral arteries were patent during the treatment, and the blood flow velocity of the false lumen was reduced in all 33 patients. There were no adverse events such as distal outflow tract embolism and coil displacement during the operation. During the period of hospitalization, one patient developed intimal rupture of subrenal abdominal aortic dissection on the fourth day after operation and emergency endovascular graft exclusion was performed for abdominal aortic dissection, and the patient recovered well from the emergency operation. The follow-up time was (16.7±14.0) months. One patient died 1 year after surgery due to non-disease-related factors. Follow-up CTA imaging results showed that the maximum diameter of the aorta in abdominal visceral segment tended to be smaller ((39.1±13.4) mm vs. (41.3±11.9) mm, P=0.469), and the maximum diameter of the false lumen was significantly reduced ((16.2±12.9) mm vs. (23.5±10.7) mm, P=0.014). The maximum diameter of the aortic dissection was reduced in 12 cases, stable in 19 cases, expanded in 2 cases. The maximum diameter of the false lumen was effectively reduced in 22 cases, stable in 10 cases, and expanded in 1 case. Four patients developed small endoleak in the false lumen, one of them was nearby the renal artery stent, and the remaining patients experienced complete thrombosis of the false lumen. Conclusions: Endovascular treatment of distal aortic dissection involving abdominal visceral segment with bare-metal stents related technique could promote the shrink and the thrombosis of the false lumen, and slow down the blood flow from the tear into the false lumen in the setting of patency of visceral arteries. 目的： 探讨裸支架相关技术治疗涉及腹主动脉内脏分支区的主动脉远端夹层的效果。 方法： 本研究为观察性研究，选取2012年7月至2019年9月在上海长海医院接受裸支架相关技术腔内治疗的主动脉远端夹层患者33例。分析术前、术中及术后影像学资料［全主动脉CT血管成像（CTA）及数字减影血管造影（DSA）］，根据患者主动脉直径的变化及夹层的假腔血栓化情况来评价治疗效果，判断标准：主动脉夹层最大直径变化<5 mm为稳定；主动脉夹层最大直径缩小≥5 mm为有效缩小，主动脉夹层最大直径增加≥5 mm为扩张；假腔的直径变化定义同上。记录院内并发症、出院后的临床症状及生存情况。 结果： 本研究共纳入33例主动脉远端夹层患者，其中男性28例，年龄为（57.6±4.9）岁。21例患者采用裸支架+弹簧圈技术，其中8例联合覆膜支架；12例采用多层裸支架技术，其中4例联合覆膜支架。术中DSA结果显示，33例患者主动脉真腔及分支动脉均通畅，假腔血流速度减慢，无远端流出道栓塞及弹簧圈不良移位等不良事件。在院期间1例患者术后第4天发生肾下腹主动脉夹层内膜破裂，急诊行腹主动脉夹层腔内隔绝术，院内恢复可。术后随访时间为（16.7±14.0）个月，1例患者（院内2次手术）术后出现腰背部酸痛，术后1年非疾病死亡，其余患者均存活。全主动脉CTA结果显示，分支区主动脉夹层最大直径较术前有减小趋势［（39.1±13.4）mm比（41.3±11.9）mm，P=0.469］，假腔最大直径缩小［（16.2±12.9）mm比（23.5±10.7）mm，P=0.014］。主动脉远端夹层最大直径有效缩小12例、稳定19例、扩张2例，主动脉远端夹层假腔最大直径有效缩小22例、稳定10例、有效扩张1例。4例患者假腔存在内漏，1例患者肾动脉支架处存在内漏，余患者假腔血栓化良好。 结论： 使用裸支架相关技术对涉及腹主动脉内脏分支区的主动脉远端夹层进行腔内治疗，可以在保证分支动脉通畅的前提下，有效封闭夹层裂口，有效促进远期夹层假腔血栓化及假腔直径缩小。."

    "abstract": "Preoperative malperfusion of acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) remains a catastrophic complication that is associated with high postoperative morbidity and mortality. The relationship between malperfusion and long-term survival in the Chinese population is unknown. A total of 771 patients who underwent ATAAD surgery between January 2009 and December 2018 at our center were included. In-hospital mortality, complications, morbidity, and long-term survival were analyzed. Preoperative malperfusion was identified in 292 of 771 patients (37.9%), the in-hospital mortality rate was 20.9% in patients with preoperative malperfusion and 9.2% in those without. Independent predictors of in-hospital mortality included any malperfusion (odds ratio [OR], 5.132; p = .001), pericardial tamponade (OR, 1.808; p = .046), advanced age (OR, 1.028; p = .003), and cardiopulmonary bypass time (OR, 1.008; p = .001). Immediate emergency surgery (OR, 0.492; p = .007) and antegrade cerebral perfusion perioperatively (OR, 0.477; p = .020) were protective against postoperative mortality. The postoperative survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 94.4% ± 1.5%, 91.9% ± 1.8%, and 83.0% ± 3.2% in patients with malperfusion and 94.7% ± 1.1%, 90.2% ± 1.7%, and 84.4% ± 2.7%, respectively, in those without. Preoperative malperfusion did not significantly affect the long-term outcomes of operative survivors (log-rank p = .601). Malperfusion resulted in an unfavorable prognosis in the short term, but showed almost equal long-term survival in patients without malperfusion of ATAAD. Emergency central repair might be considered to further improve the outcomes of ATAAD with malperfusion."

    "abstract": "Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is the gold standard for surgical management of descending thoracic aortic pathology. Depending on the anatomy, TEVAR often requires deployment across the origin of the left subclavian artery (LSA) to obtain a proximal seal, thus potentially compromising perfusion to the left upper extremity (LUE). However, in most patients this is generally well tolerated without revascularization due to collateralization from the left vertebral artery (LVA). We present a complex 59-year-old Caucasian patient case of TEVAR with a history of prior arch debranching and intraoperative LSA coverage requiring subsequent LSA embolization and emergency take-back for left carotid-subclavian bypass. The purpose of this case report is to highlight an often overlooked anatomic LVA variant and an atypical, delayed presentation of acute LUE limb ischemia."

    "abstract": "Unicuspid aortic valve (UAV) is a rare congenital anomaly that usually presents with aortic stenosis or mixed stenosis and regurgitation early in life. Ascending aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection are important complications of UAVs. A 27-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a complaint of acute chest pain. Bedside transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed dilatation of ascending aorta (47 mm) and mild aortic regurgitation; computed tomography (CT) angiography revealed a suspicious dissection flap within ascending aorta. A cardiovascular surgeon, a radiologist, and a cardiologist were immediately consulted. TTE performed by the cardiologist revealed a unicuspid unicommissural aortic valve and dilated ascending aorta with no signs of dissection. Aortic dissection image on CT angiogram was interpreted by an experienced radiologist and the cardiovascular surgeon as superior pericardial recess and considered as a false-positive dissection image. Given the patient was pain-free, the CT image was considered false positive and as TTE clearly visualized the ascending aorta, the heart team decided that no further imaging is required. After excluding acute aortic syndrome, acute coronary syndrome, and other causes of acute chest pain, the patient was discharged with close follow-up. Diagnosis of aortic dissection is based on noninvasive imaging modalities, and CT is the first-line imaging choice in most emergency departments. Depending on a single imaging modality may cause false interpretations and lead to unnecessary surgical explorations."

    "abstract": "There are limited data regarding the clinical outcomes of reoperative aortic root or ascending aorta replacement after prior aortic valve replacement (AVR). We aimed to analyze outcomes of reoperative aortic root or ascending aorta replacement after prior AVR. Eighty patients with prior AVR underwent reoperative aortic root or ascending aorta replacement in our hospital. The indications were root or ascending aortic aneurysm in 36 patients, root or ascending aortic dissection in 37, root false aneurysm in 2, prosthesis valve endocarditis (PVE) with root abscess in 2, Behçet's disease (BD) with root destruction in 3 patients. An elective surgery was performed in 63 patients and an emergent surgery in 17. The survival and freedom from aortic events during the follow-up were evaluated with the Kaplan-Meier survival curve and the log-rank test. The operative techniques included ascending aorta replacement in 14 patients, ascending aorta replacement with AVR in 3, prosthesis-sparing root replacement (PSRR) in 35, Bentall procedure in 24, and Cabrol procedure in 4 patients. Operative mortality was 1.3% (1/80). A composite of adverse events occurred in 5 patients, including 1 operative death, 2 stroke and 3 renal failure necessitating hemodialysis. The mean follow-up was 35.5±22.1 months. Five late deaths occurred. The Kaplan-Meier survival at 1 year, 3 years and 6 years were 97.5%, 91.1% and 84.1%, respectively. Aortic events developed in 3 patients. The freedom from aortic events at 1-year, 3-year, and 6-year were 100%, 96.3% and 88.9%, respectively. There were no differences in survival and freedom from aortic events between the elective group and the emergent group.

    "abstract": "Adjunctive false lumen embolization (FLE) with thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in patients with chronic aortic dissection is thought to induce FL thrombosis and favorable aortic remodeling. However, these data are derived from small single-institution experiences and the potential benefit of FLE remains unproven. In this study, we examined perioperative and midterm outcomes of patients with aortic dissection undergoing concomitant TEVAR and FLE.* METHODS: : Patients 18 or older who underwent TEVAR for chronic aortic dissection with known FLE status in the Society for Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative database between January 2010 and February 2020 were included. Ruptured patients and emergent procedures were excluded. Patient characteristics, operative details and outcomes were analyzed by group: TEVAR with or without FLE. Primary outcomes were in-hospital post-operative complications and all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included follow-up mean maximum aortic diameter change, rates of false lumen thrombosis, re-intervention rates, and mortality. 884 patients were included: 46 had TEVAR/FLE and 838 had TEVAR alone. There was no significant difference between groups in terms of age, gender, comorbidities, prior aortic interventions, mean maximum pre-operative aortic diameter (5.1cm vs. 5.0cm, P=0.43), presentation symptomatology, or intervention indication. FLE was associated with significantly longer procedural times (178min vs. 146min, P=0.0002), increased contrast use (134mL vs. 113mL, P=0.02), and prolonged fluoroscopy time (34min vs. 21min, P<0.0001). However, FLE was not associated with a significant difference in post-operative complications (17.4% vs. 13.8%, P=0.51), length of stay (6.5 vs. 5.7 days, P=0.18), or in-hospital all-cause mortality (0% vs. 1.3%, P=1). In mid-term follow-up (median 15.5months, IQR 2.2-36.2 months), all-cause mortality trended lower, but was not significant (2.2% vs. 7.8%); and Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated no difference in overall survival between groups (P=0.23). By Cox regression analysis, post-operative complications had the strongest independent association with all-cause mortality (HR 2.65, 95% CI 1.56-4.5, P<0.001). In patients with available follow-up imaging and re-intervention status, mean aortic diameter change (n=337, -0.71cm vs. -0.69cm, P=0.64) and re-intervention rates (n=487, 10% vs. 11.4%, P=1) were similar. Adjunctive FLE, despite increased procedural times, can be performed safely for patients with chronic dissection without significantly higher overall perioperative morbidity or mortality. TEVAR/FLE demonstrates trends for improved survival and increased rates of FL thrombosis in the treated thoracic segment; however, given the lack of evidence to suggest a significant reduction in re-intervention rates or induction of more favorable aortic remodeling compared to TEVAR alone, the overall utility of this technique in practice remains unclear. Further investigation is needed to determine the most appropriate role for FLE in managing chronic aortic dissections."

The incidence and mortality of syncope were recorded, and the patients were divided into syncope group and non-syncope group according to whether they were accompanied by syncope or not. The incidence of syncope in male and female patients with different cardiovascular critical diseases, the age and mortality of cardiovascular critical patients with syncope or not were analyzed and compared. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the risk factors of death, and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) was drawn to evaluate the predictive value of risk factors on the prognosis of patients. The incidence of syncope in 5 kinds of cardiovascular critical patients from high to low was: acute myocardial infarction 3.03% (28/925), arrhythmia 2.70% (25/925), pulmonary embolism 1.51% (14/925), aortic dissection rupture 1.41% (13/925), acute heart failure 0.65% (6/925), with statistically significant differences (χ2 = 10.765, P = 0.010). There was no significant difference in the incidence of syncope between male and female patients with pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection rupture, acute myocardial infarction, arrhythmia and acute heart failure. The age of patients with aortic dissection rupture, acute myocardial infarction and arrhythmia in syncope group were significantly higher than those in non-syncope group [aortic dissection rupture (years old): 66.29±15.64 vs. 57.63±14.23, acute myocardial infarction (years old): 69.55±15.13 vs. 62.10±15.75, arrhythmia (years old): 70.48±14.93 vs. 60.29±16.31, all P < 0.05]. The mortality of patients with pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection rupture, acute myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, acute heart failure in syncope group were significantly higher than those in non-syncope group [pulmonary embolism: 5.81% (5/86) vs. 0.95% (8/839), aortic dissection rupture: 4.65% (4/86) vs. 0.60% (5/839), acute myocardial infarction: 4.65% (4/86) vs. 1.19% (10/839), arrhythmia: 2.33% (2/86) vs. 0.95% (8/839), acute heart failure: 2.33% (2/86) vs. 0.60% (5/839), all P < 0.05]. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that age [odds ratio (OR) = 2.158, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.921-4.785, P = 0.000], pulmonary embolism (OR = 15.391, 95%CI was 8.904-27.314, P = 0.001), aortic dissection rupture (OR = 13.079, 95%CI was 6.237-25.509, P = 0.000), acute myocardial infarction (OR = 18.826, 95%CI was 10.420-32.921, P = 0.000), syncope (OR = 4.940, 95%CI was 1.764-9.287, P = 0.000) were risk factors for the prognosis of patients with acute and critical cardiovascular diseases. ROC curve analysis showed that syncope had a certain predictive value for 28-day prognosis of patients [the area under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0.760, P = 0.000], when the cut-off value was 4.12, the sensitivity was 88.51%, the specificity was 78.05%, the positive predictive value was 81.31%, and the negative predictive value was 84.27%. Syncope is an independent risk factor of death in patients with acute and critical cardiovascular diseases. For patients with syncope as the chief complaint, we should quickly identify the types of acute and critical diseases and assess the risk of sudden death."

Not only critical preoperative conditions but also postoperative cardiac tamponade and vital organ ischaemia are risk factors for early mortality after acute type A aortic dissection repair."

    "abstract": "Displaced rib fractures can injure intercostal vessels leading to chest wall hematomas. As the bleeding occurs within the vessel, compression of the vessel wall helps in preventing further bleeding. Therefore, chest wall hematomas rarely result in shock. A thin 78-year-old man transferred to the emergency department with complaints of left dorsal pain due to an injury. He had a history of hypertension and aorta dissection. He arrived at the ED in a state of shock and presented with a large left dorsal wall mass. Subsequent imaging using computed tomography angiography revealed a large hyperdense hematoma at the left dorsal-flank wall along with rib fracture (11th intercostal artery). Moreover, a large fusiform aneurysm was detected from the abdominal aorta to the iliac arteries. Extravasation of the contrast agent was detected at the branch of the 11th intercostal artery, and hence, embolization was performed. The dermis, which comprises collagen and elastin fibers, plays an important role in vessel compression to prevent bleeding. The aortic media also comprises collagen and elastin fibers. Cell turnover, loss of collagen, and excessive elastolysis are associated with the formation of abdominal aortic aneurysms. The systemic degeneration of connecting tissue (collagen and elastin fiber) appears to be progress in patients with an aortic aneurysms and history of aortic dissection compared with other healthy older individuals. Physicians should be cognizant of the potential unexpected large hematoma complications if a risk of systemic connecting tissue degradation exists, as seen in patients with aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection."

However, little is known regarding the outcomes of proximal aortic surgery in this high-risk cohort. Perioperative (in-hospital or 30-day mortality) and 10-year outcomes were analyzed for all the patients who underwent open proximal aortic repair with the diagnosis of nonruptured thoracic aortic aneurysm (aneurysm, n = 325) or type A aortic dissection (dissection, n = 461) from 1987 to 2015 using the US Renal Data System database. In patients with aneurysm, perioperative mortality was 12.6%. The 10-year mortality was 81% ± 3%. Age 65 years or more (hazard ratio [HR], 1.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 1.78; P = .03), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.01-2.82; P = .047), and Black race (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.09-1.97; P = .01) were independently associated with worse 10-year mortality.

We described challenging perioperative and 10-year outcomes for dialysis patients undergoing proximal aortic repair. The present study suggests the need for careful patient selection in the elective repair of proximal aortic aneurysm for dialysis-dependent patients, whereas it affirms the feasibility of emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissections."

This observational study analyzed all records in the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) database. NEDS aggregates discharge data from 984 hospitals in 36 states and the District of Columbia in the United States of America. All patients with thoracic and thoracoabdominal AD recorded as their principal diagnosis were identified via ICD codes. Patient characteristics (weekday|weekend) count: 26,759|9,640, P = 0.016; age (years): 65.2 ± 15.8|64.7 ± 16.2, P = 0.016; women: 11,318 (42.3%)|4,086 (42.4), P = 0.883; Charlson comorbidity index: 2.3 ± 1.7|2.3 ± 1.6, P = 0.025. There were 36,399 ED visits with diagnosed AD. Annual AD diagnoses increased by 70% from 2006 to 2017. From 2012-2017, patients had lower in-hospital mortality (9.9% versus 11.9%, P < 0.001) compared with 2006-2011. Patients reporting during the weekend had higher in-hospital mortality (11.8% versus 10.4%, P < 0.001) compared with weekdays. On multivariable analysis, year of presentation remained independently associated with in-hospital mortality, with 2012-2017 being associated with reduced mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.90, 95% CI: 0.82, 0.99, P = 0.031), as compared with 2006-2011. Weekend presentation remained independently associated with worse in-hospital mortality (OR 1.17, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.29, P = 0.003) compared with weekday presentation. Although AD mortality is decreasing, the patients presenting on the weekend were 13% more likely to die in the hospital compared with patients presenting during the week."

Children with Down syndrome are at risk for neurologic injury with minor trauma; advanced imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging may be needed in select cases. For children in whom a connective tissue disorder is suspected, aortic dissection and spontaneous pneumothorax must be considered.

    "abstract": "Tirone E. David described aortic valve-sparing root reimplantion (AVSRR) almost 30 years ago. At our centre, we adopted this operation in 1993, and since then, we have performed >700 operations over a time period of >25 years. In this report, we present our single-centre experience. Between 1993 and 2019, a total of 732 patients underwent AVSRR at our centre. The mean age was 53 ± 15 and 522 (71%) were male. Marfan syndrome was present in 117 (16%) patients and bicuspid aortic valve in 81 (11%). The indication for surgery was aortic root aneurysm in 588 (80%) patients and acute aortic dissection in 144 (20%) patients. Mini-sternotomy was performed in 74 (10%) patients. A straight tube graft (David I) was used in 677 (92%) and a Valsalva-graft in 55 (8%) patients. Cusp plasty was done in 83 (11%) patients. Concomitant cardiac procedures were performed in 438 (60%) patients. Overall in-hospital mortality was 3.8% (n = 29) and 1.9% (n = 11) in elective cases. Postoperative echocardiography was available for 671 patients and showed aortic insufficiency (AI) ≤I° in 647 (96%) patients. The mean follow-up time was 10 ± 6.7 years and comprised a total of 7307 patient-years. The 1-, 5-, 10- and 15-year survival rates were: 93%, 88%, 77% and 65%, respectively. The rates for freedom from valve-related reoperation at 1, 5, 10 and 15 years after initial surgery were 97%, 93%, 88% and 85%, respectively. Cox regression analysis identified age [odds ratio (OR) = 0.975, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.955-0.995, P = 0.016], hyperlipidaemia (OR = 1.980, 95% CI = 1.175-3.335, P = 0.010), preoperative level of left ventricular ejection function (OR = 1.749, 95% CI = 1.024-2.987, P = 0.041) and postoperative degree of AI (OR = 1.880, 95% CI = 1.532-2.308, P ≤ 0.001) as risk factors for the future AI or reoperation. David procedure can be performed extremely safely, with low risks for perioperative morbidity and mortality, both in elective situations via minimally invasive access and in emergent settings for acute aortic type A dissection. Regarding long-term outcome, David's AVSRR seems to provide excellent clinical results and sustainable function of the aortic valve in the majority of patients almost 3 decades after its introduction."

    "abstract": "Marfan syndrome is an inherited connective tissue disease that causes aortic root dilatation and dissection and requires surgical intervention. Apart from emergent surgery for aortic dissection or aortic aneurysmal rupture, prophylactic surgical intervention can also be administered, depending on the severity of aortic root dilatation. The direct relationship between surgical intervention and aortic regurgitation was seldom mentioned in previous studies. A retrospective cohort study was designed to determine the clinical presentations of prophylactic surgery in patients with Marfan syndrome. Between January 2009 and May 2019, 112 patients, adolescents and young adults, treated in the Department of Pediatric Cardiology of Taipei Veterans General Hospital, were enrolled. All patients' sex, body measurements, echocardiography reports, and surgical notes were collected for statistical analysis. Among the participants, nine patients (8%) underwent the Bentall procedure, and the other 103 did not receive surgical intervention. The operation group had a larger aortic root size (4.89 vs 2.86 cm, p < 0.001), more dilated left ventricle (4.81 vs 4.1 cm, p = 0.002), and higher prevalence of moderate and severe aortic regurgitation (66% vs 1%, p < 0.001) than the nonoperation group. Among adolescents and young adults with Marfan syndrome, echocardiographic presentation of aortic root dilatation, left ventricular dilatation, and significant aortic regurgitation was significantly associated with prophylactic surgical intervention. According to the study, significant aortic regurgitation should also be considered as an important indication for prophylactic surgery."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine the effect of the addition of an aortic root replacement or sinus repair on mortality and morbidity during aortic arch repair. A total of 2472 patients underwent proximal or total aortic arch repair with hypothermic circulatory arrest between 2002 and 2018 at 12 centres. Multivariable logistic regressions (MV) and propensity score (PS) with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analyses were performed. A total of 1099 (44.5%) patients had additional aortic root replacement (n = 934) or sinus repair (n = 165). Those with aortic root interventions were younger (61 ± 13 vs 64 ± 13 years, P < 0.001) and had less females (23% vs 35%, P < 0.001), less dissection (31% vs 36%, P = 0.004), less urgent cases (35% vs 39%, P = 0.047), more connective tissue disease (7% vs 3%, P < 0.001) and less total arch replacements (14% vs 22%, P < 0.001). On adjusted analyses, the addition of aortic root procedure was associated with increased mortality [MV: odds ratio (OR) 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-1.92; PS-IPTW: risk increased by 3.7%, 95% CI 1.2-6.3%, P = 0.004]. Reoperation for bleeding was also increased with the addition of aortic root intervention (MV: OR 1.48, 95% 1.10-1.99; PS-IPTW: risk increased by 3.2%, 95% CI 0.8-5.6%, P = 0.009). The risks of stroke and dialysis-dependent renal failure were similar. When looking only at non-elective cases, the increased risk of mortality was more pronounced (MV: OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.11-2.32, P = 0.013; PS-IPTW: risk increased by 6.8%, 95 CI 1.7-11.8%, P = 0.008, and a number need to harm of 15 patients to cause 1 additional death). The addition of aortic root replacement or sinus repair during proximal or total aortic arch repair seems to increase postoperative mortality only in non-elective cases."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (AAAD) is a surgical emergency with high operative mortality. Distal propogration of the dissecting flap can lead to malperfusion of territory supplied by the aorta including axillary and brachial arteries causing ischaemia of the upper limb. We present a case of a 67 year old gentleman who had AAAD and developed upper limb malperfusion after repair. Despite adequate repair, the residual dissecting flap propagated distally in the upper arm vasculature causing thombosis of the brachial artery. The patient subsequently underwent brachial artery cut-down and embolectomy but revascularization was not achieved. He ultimately required an above-elbow amputation. Upper limb ischaemia from AAAD is a rare phenomenon that is mainly due to malperfusion. Majority of malperfusion resolve after aortic dissection repair. This is an unusual case of persistent upper limb ischaemia despite adequate repair due to the direct extension of the residual dissection flap from the aortic root into the brachial artery."

To achieve the structural goals of the operation, the conduct of the surgery is targeted from it inception at restoring true lumen flow. In this regard, institution of cardiopulmonary bypass and circulation management is key to allow adequate systemic flow, perfusion of brain and visceral organs and comprehensive systemic cooling to achieve circulatory arrest when needed. Different strategies have been used to establish adequate true lumen perfusion with varying success rates, with the most common still being femoral cannulation. More recently axillary and central cannulation strategies have shown satisfactory results by allowing more reliable true lumen flow. Cannulation approach should, therefore, depend on individual patient characteristics, presentation, and true lumen anatomy."

No definitive guidelines are available for the management of floating aortic thrombus.

A floating thrombus within the aortic arch was found by computed tomography angiography (CTA). No evidence of coagulopathies was found. However, with the assistance of a three dimensional-printed model, this floating thrombus was identified to be caused by occult aortic dissection (AD). Subsequently, an emergency thoracic endovascular repair was performed. The patient's back pain was rapidly alleviated postoperatively. CTA at 1 year showed no filling defect in the stent-graft and aorta. Occult AD is a potential factor causing floating aortic thrombi, endovascular stent-graft exclusion may be an optimal therapeutic choice with promising results. Moreover, the combination of CTA and three dimensional-printed models can contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of floating aortic thrombi due to occult AD."

A total of 582 patients who received emergency surgery for acute DeBakey type I aortic dissection from 2014 to 2018 were enrolled in this study. Mechanical ventilation period after surgery longer than 48 hours was defined as postoperative PMV. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for PMV. This study also compared short- and long-term outcomes in patients who developed PMV with patients who did not develop this complication. To identify and compare long-term cumulative survival rate, Kaplan-Meier survival curve was plotted. Among all enrolled patients, 259 (44.5%) received PMV treatment. Our data suggested that the length of intensive care unit and hospital stay were longer for patients who received PMV treatment. Thirty-day mortality was also higher in patients with PMV than in patients without PMV. Elevated leukocyte count and increased serum cystatin C level upon admission, lower preoperative platelet count and longer cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) duration were identified as risk factors for PMV. Interestingly, our data suggested that there was no significant difference of survival rate between patients with or without PMV history. PMV after DeBakey type I aortic dissection repair surgery was a common complication and associated with increased short-term mortality rate but did not affect long-term mortality rate. Elevated preoperative leukocyte count, increased preoperative serum cystatin C level, lower preoperative platelet count and longer CPB duration were risk factors for PMV."

A total of 7 patients had computed tomographic angiography images after the event and during the follow-up. We performed 1-month and 1-year follow-up examinations. The incidence of IAD was 0.13%. The female sex ratio was as 63%. A total of 37% of the patients had presented with acute coronary syndrome. In 37% of the patients, dissection occured while support catheter use, but in the remaining patients, dissections developed owing to hydraulic pressure. Regardless of the Dunning staging, 7 patients were followed-up with medical treatment, and 1 patient with decreased coronary flow was referred to emergency coronary bypass surgery. Regression was in the first tomography in 4 patients and observed in the control tomography in the remaining patients with medical treatment. The in-hospital 1-month and 1-year mortality rates were 0%. IAD is a fatal disease, and conservative follow-up is suggested due to lack of clear management recommendations. The findings in our study showed that medical treatment is the first choice for the hemodynamically stable patients when dissection is sealed by stenting; however, surgical treatment is required in patients with the decreased coronary flow."

We included 72 patients in this retrospective study and study groups were divided into two groups according to 65 age. Demographic data, dissection type (Stanford A-B), DBP, systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean arteriel pressure (MAP), heart rate (/min) main complaints, preoperative length of stay, hospitalisation clinic (clinic/intensive care unit), length of hospitaliisation, complications during hospitalisation (renal failure etc..) and the outcome (death/dischargement) results were noted. Preoperative lenth of stay, hospitalisation length, outcome and complications were compared between groups according to SBP, DBP, MAP and heart rate. Mean blood pressure values of the Stanford type B patients over 65 years old were higher than the other group (p<0.05). Fifty percent of patients under 65 years old were discharged but this ratio was 26.9% in the elder group. DBP was positively correlated with preoperative length of stay and hospitalisation length and negatively correlated with mortality. DBP under 65 mmHg was significantly related with high mortality (p<0.05). When the age and presentation time heart rate is added to each other, the values over 142 were significantly related with high mortality (p<0.05). The presentation time vital signs especially the DBP may be helpful for emergency clinicians to predict the prognosis and outcome in aortic dissection patients which has high mortality ratio in patients over 65 years of age."

    "abstract": "Type A acute aortic dissection (AAD) remains a challenging cardiac emergency despite the availability of various management strategies. This study compared the outcomes of supracoronary ascending aortic replacement (SCAAR) with aortic valve (AV) resuspension with those of modified Bentall's operation for type A AAD and the progression of aortic regurgitation (AR), long-term dilatation of aortic root and proximal arch, and long-term mortality in SCAAR patients. Sixty patients underwent surgery for type A AAD (January 2005 to December 2015). Forty-three patients underwent SCAAR with AV resuspension and 17 underwent modified Bentall's operation. All patients were followed up. Upon follow-up of SCAAR patients (n=40), there was significant reduction in aortic root size (preoperative 39.3 mm [9.4] vs. postoperative 33.1 mm [9.1]; P<0.001). Three of these patients worsened to severe AR while others had similar or lesser degree of AR. On comparison between preoperative and postoperative dimensions of all patients (n=53), there was no significant difference in distal ascending aorta size (35.7 mm [8.1] vs. 34.4 mm [8.9]; P=0.52). However, an increase in descending thoracic aorta size (28.8 mm [7.8] vs. 33.7 mm [9.9]; P<0.001) was observed. In-hospital and late mortalities for SCAAR vs. modified Bentall's procedure were 11.7% (seven patients) (7% [3] vs. 23.5% [4]) and 28% (15 patients) (15% [6] vs. 69% [9]), respectively. SCAAR with AV resuspension is a safe surgical option for type A AAD. Preservation of AV is associated with better long-term outcomes and reduced mortality. Modified Bentall's operation may be associated with long-term mortality."

A young lady presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizures coupled with hepatitic pattern of deranged liver function test. Examination revealed blood pressure of 99/75 mmHg and hepatic flap. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia. Urgent bedside echocardiography showed preserved cardiac function without significant valvular pathology, but noted a moderate pericardial effusion. Abdominal Ultrasound excluded liver cirrhosis or biliary obstructions. Viral hepatitis serologies and anti-liver panel were negative. She was progressively hypotensive with concurrent acute liver failure and oliguric acute kidney injury. Despite no chest pain, her rising serum troponin and widened mediastinum prompted an urgent computed-tomography aortogram, which showed a 4.3 cm dilatation of ascending thoracic aorta with acute haemopericardium and cardiac tamponade. She was diagnosed with malperfusion syndrome from Stanford type A aortic dissection. She underwent emergent ascending aorta and aortic arch repair and dialysis. She experienced complete recovery in her kidney, liver, and neurological function post-operatively. Painless aortic dissection masquerade as acute liver failure is uncommon. We describe a successful early recognition of malperfusion syndrome from painless aortic dissection, thus providing window for timely, life-saving intervention. Clinical challenges in this case include: (i) atypical presentation of aortic dissection, (ii) worsening acute liver failure which could lead to unnecessary liver transplantation, and (iii) risk of contrast-induced nephropathy in the setting of acute renal failure."

On admission, a nasopharyngeal swab was performed to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2, as per hospital protocol during the current COVID-19 pandemic. A total-body CT angiography was performed to investigate the cause of acute limb ischaemia and to rule out aortic dissection; the examination showed a total occlusion of the left common iliac artery and a non-obstructive thrombosis of a subsegmental pulmonary artery branch in the right basal lobe. Lung CT scan confirmed a typical pattern of interstitial COVID-19 pneumonia. Coronary angiography showed a thrombotic occlusion of the proximal segment of the right coronary artery. Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed, with manual thrombectomy, followed by deployment of two stents. The patient was subsequently transferred to the operating room, where a Fogarty thrombectomy was performed. The patient was then admitted to the COVID area of our hospital. Seven hours later, the swab returned positive for COVID-19. COVID-19 can have an atypical presentation with thrombosis at multiple sites."

    "title": "Should We Postpone Elective Cardiovascular Procedures and Percutaneous Coronary Interventions During the COVID-19 Pandemic?",
    "abstract": "Prioritization among patients with coronary artery disease represents a difficult issue during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We present our clinical practices and patients' outcomes after elective, emergent, and urgent cardiovascular surgery and percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). We also investigated the rate of nosocomial infection of SARS-CoV-2 in health workers (HWs), including surgeons after cardiovascular procedures and percutaneous interventions (PCI). We performed 186 cardiovascular operations and PCI between March 15 and October 15. According to the level of priority (LoP), we performed urgent and emergent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and cardiac valve repair or replacement surgery in 44 patients. In one patient with acute chordae rupture with pulmonary edema, we performed mitral valve replacement. We performed the aortic arch repair in two patients with type-I aortic dissection in urgent situations. Therefore, in 47 patients we performed cardiac operations in urgent or emergent situations. Elective CABG (N = 28) and elective cardiac valve (N = 10) surgeries were performed (total: 38). While rescue PCI was urgently performed in 47 patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), it was performed in elective or emergent situations in 40 patients with myocardial ischemia. Endovascular treatment was performed in four patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and in four patients with chronic arterial occlusion, respectively. Surgical vascular repair and embolectomy were performed in patients with peripheral artery injury (N = 6) and acute arterial embolic events (N = 4), respectively. We performed thoracic computed tomography followed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in patients with irregular diffuse reticular opacities with or without consolidation on chest X-ray. Blood coagulation disorders including d-dimer, thromboplastin time (TT), and partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) were measured prior to procedures. No mortality and morbidity was seen after percutaneous and surgical arterial or venous procedures. The total mortality rate was 4.1% (8 of 186 CAD patients or valve surgery) after urgent and emergent CABG (N = 4), an urgent valve replacement (N = 1), and PCI (N = 3). Low cardiac output syndrome (LOS) and major adverse cardiac cerebrovascular event (MACCE) were the mortality factors after cardiac surgery. The reasons for death after PCI were sudden cardiac arrest related to the dissection of the left main coronary artery during procedure and pneumonia due to COVID-19 (N = 2). Ground-glass opacities in combination with pulmonary consolidations were detected in seven patients. Interlobular septal and pleural thickening with patchy bronchiectasis in the bilateral lower lobe involvement was found after thoracic computed tomography in these patients. We confirmed in-hospital COVID-19 using a PCR test in two patients with STEMI prior to PCI. PT and aPTT increased, but fibrin degradation products did not in those two patients. We confirmed COVID-19 via phone call in six CABG patients and one PCI patient after discharge from the hospital. None of the patients diagnosed with COVID-19 died after being discharged from the hospital. Cardiovascular surgery and PCI can safely be performed with acceptable complications and mortality rates in elective situations, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Preoperative control of OR traffic, careful evaluation of the patient's history, consultation, and precautions taken by healthcare professionals are important, during and after procedures. Also important is wearing a mask and face shield and careful disinfection of equipment and space."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is an emergency disease with high misdiagnosis rate and mortality. The aim of the present study is to explore the impact of blood-related biomarkers, specifically D-dimer, on in-hospital outcomes of patients with AAD. A total of 345 patients in our hospital from December 2013 to April 2017 were included. The cutoff value for D-dimer and LDL-C were set as 5.9mg/l and 1.45 mg/l, respectively. The univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify the independently prognostic predictors. The results showed that patients with type A AAD had higher risk of in-hospital mortality compared with those with type B disease. Moreover, results revealed the type A AAD (OR 6.382, 95%CI: 2.423 to 16.812), D-dimer (OR 2.160, 95%CI: 1.072 to 4.350), and LDL-C (OR 0.373, 95%CI: 0.148 to 0.940) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Subgroup analysis suggested that D-dimer (OR 2.295, 95%CI: 1.140 to 4.622) was an independently prognostic factor in type A AAD. In summary, D-dimer ≥5.9 mg/L and type A AAD were independently associated with in-hospital mortality in AAD patients. Moreover, subgroup analysis proved that the elevated D-dimer was related to poor prognosis in type A AAD."

    "abstract": "To investigate the characteristics and prognosis of abdominal or thoracic aortic aneurysm (AAA or TAA) patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) postoperatively. Patients admitted to ICU postoperatively with a primary diagnosis of AAA or TAA were screened in the eICU Collaborative Research Database, which contained data from multiple ICUs throughout the continental United States in 2014 and 2015. Baseline characteristics and comorbidities and were investigated and factors associated with ICU mortality were explored using univariable logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the prognosis predictive performance of the widely used severity scoring system APACHE IVa. A total of 974 patients including 677 AAA and 297 TAA patients admitted to ICU postoperatively were included. Compared with TAA, AAA patients had a significantly higher median age (72 versus 64 years, P<0.001). 89.07% AAA and 84.51% TAA patients underwent elective surgery (P=0.046), 8.71% AAA and 31.99% TAA patients were with aortic dissection (P<0.001), and 10.19% AAA and 2.36% TAA patients suffered from rupture of aortic aneurysm (P<0.001). Hypertension requiring treatment was the most common comorbidity (57.31% for AAA and 61.95% for TAA). TAA patients had significantly higher ICU mortality (9.43% versus 2.36%, P<0.001) than AAA. Several factors were found to be significantly associated with ICU mortality, including urgent surgery, with aortic dissection, rupture of aortic aneurysm, TAA, and a higher APACHE IVa score on ICU admission. APACHE IVa showed a good predictive performance for ICU mortality with an area under the ROC curve of 0.9176 (95% CI 0.8789-0.9390). The prognosis of aortic aneurysm patients admitted to ICU postoperatively is yet to improve, and factors associated with prognosis are mainly related to the condition itself. APACHE IVa can be used for prognosis prediction."

Aortic dissection (AD) is an emergency often presenting as acute chest pain and warranting urgent intervention. A 32-year-old male presented to Emergency Department with acute chest pain. Clinical examination revealed feeble pulses in bilateral lower limbs with a blood pressure difference between upper and lower limbs. Two-dimensional Echocardiography was suggestive of IAA with AD in the descending thoracic aorta. This was confirmed on computed tomography scan of the aorta which revealed complete interruption of the aortic arch distal to left subclavian artery along with the presence of an intimo-medial flap in descending thoracic aorta. A diagnosis of IAA with AD was made. The patient underwent an urgent aortic repair surgery following which he has been largely asymptomatic. A suspicion of AD should always be made in any patient presenting with acute onset chest pain radiating to the back along with accelerated hypertension/feeble pulses in extremity. Occurrence of AD in an adult with IAA is a distinct rarity and has been documented only thrice."

The initial watch-and-wait strategy without emergency aortic repair was taken in 52 cases in which the maximum aortic diameter was ≤50 mm, pain score on arrival at our hospital was ≤3/10 on the numerical rating scale and there was no ulcer-like projection (ULP) in the ascending aorta. Eleven patients who fulfilled the criteria but developed cardiac tamponade underwent emergency pericardial drainage without aortic repair. Among these 11 patients, 3 patients developed an aortic event during the hospitalization; 1 patient developed enlargement of the ULP 18 days later but refused surgery, another patient developed rupture of the dissected brachiocephalic artery 4 days later and underwent emergency repair of the ascending aorta and the brachiocephalic artery and the other patient developed a new ULP in the ascending aorta 14 days later and underwent aortic repair. All 11 patients were discharged home. During follow-up (3.0 ± 2.4 years), 1 patient developed a recurrent type A acute aortic dissection and underwent emergency aortic repair 29 months later.

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) is an emergent and life-threatening disorder, and its in-hospital mortality was reported to be as high as 24.4%-27.4%. AD can mimic other more common disorders, especially acute myocardial infarction (AMI), in terms of both symptoms and electrocardiogram changes. Reperfusion for patients with AD may result in catastrophic outcomes. Increased awareness of AD can be helpful for early diagnosis, especially among younger patients. We report a 28-year-old man with acute left side chest pain without cardiovascular risk factors. He was diagnosed with acute inferior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), which, based on illness history, physical examination, and intraoperative findings, was eventually determined to be type A AD caused by Marfan syndrome. Emergent coronary angiography revealed the anomalous origin of the right coronary artery as well as eccentric stenosis of the proximal segment. Subsequently, computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed intramural thrombosis of the ascending aorta. Finally, the patient was transferred to the cardiovascular surgery department for a Bentall operation. He was discharged 13 d after the operation, and aortic CTA proved a full recovery at the 2-year follow-up. It is essential and challenging to differentiate AD from AMI. Type A AD should be the primary consideration in younger STEMI patients without cardiovascular risk factors but with outstanding features of Marfan syndrome."

    "abstract": "The present study used data from the Japanese Committee for Stentgraft Management's national registry, which contains unique surgical data, including surgical timing, anatomic factors, and pathologic factors, to determine the generalized community experience with thoracic endovascular abdominal aortic repair (TEVAR). The medical background and short-term outcomes were reviewed for patients who had undergone TEVAR for a thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA; 14,235 cases) or aortic dissection (AD; 990 type A and 4259 type B) from 2008 to 2015. TEVAR for AD was separated from that for TAAs; only the background and short-term outcomes were evaluated. The technical outcomes of TEVAR for TAA were also evaluated. All the cases were categorized as follows: elective, urgent (within 24 hours after admission), or emergent (immediately after admission). The outcomes included in-hospital mortality and persistent stroke and paraplegia diagnosed at discharge. The number of debranching bypasses, proximal landing zone (0, 1, 2, ≥3), and zone length were included in the logistic regression analysis. The mortality, stroke, and paraplegia rates in the TAA and AD groups were 4.4%, 4.6%, and 3.7% and 4.0%, 2.9%, and 2.8%, respectively. After analyzing the TAA cohort, we found that urgent and emergent cases were associated with all adverse outcomes. The rate of paraplegia increased drastically in the patients with stent graft coverage that extended for six or more zones. Massive atheroma was associated with stroke and paraplegia. The cumulative survival rate of the TAA group was stratified by the urgency (ie, elective, urgent, emergent; P < .001). We found that the more proximal (0, 1, and 2) the landing zone, the greater the risk of stroke. Likewise, the longer (six or more zones) the coverage, the greater the risk of paraplegia. Urgency was strongly associated with mortality, stroke, and paraplegia, and the classification of urgent and emergent, according to the surgical timing after admission, successfully stratified the population in the long-term overall survival analysis. A proximal landing zone involving the aortic arch and debranching bypasses were associated with the occurrence of stroke, and the length of stent graft coverage for six or more zones was associated with paraplegia. Identifying these risk factors will help operators of TEVAR develop appropriate operative strategies to mitigate patient risk."

    "abstract": "The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) is a federal law established in 1986 to ensure that patients who present to an emergency department receive medical care regardless of means. Violations are reported to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and can result in significant financial penalties. Our objective was to assess all available EMTALA violations for vascular-related issues. EMTALA violations in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services publicly available hospital violations database from 2011 to 2018 were evaluated for vascular-related issues. Details recorded were case type, hospital type, hospital region, reasons for violation, disposition, and mortality. There were 7001 patients identified with any EMTALA violation and 98 (1.4%) were deemed vascular related. The majority (82.7%) of EMTALA violations occurred at urban/suburban hospitals. Based on the Association of American Medical Colleges United States region, vascular-related EMTALA violations occurred in the Northeast (7.1%), Southern (56.1%), Central (18.4%), and Western (18.4%) United States. Case types included cerebrovascular (28.6%), aortic related (22.4%; which consisted of ruptured aortic aneurysms [8.2%], aortic dissection [11.2%], and other aortic [3.1%]), vascular trauma (15.3%), venous-thromboembolic (15.3%), peripheral arterial disease (9.2%), dialysis access (5.1%), bowel ischemia (3.1%), and other (1%) cases. Patients were transferred to another facility in 41.8% of cases. The most common reasons for violation were specialty refusal or unavailability (30.6%), inappropriate documentation (29.6%), misdiagnosis (18.4%), poor communication (17.3%), inappropriate triage (13.3%), failure to obtain diagnostic laboratory tests or imaging (12.2%), and ancillary or nursing staff issues (7.1%). The overall mortality was 19.4% and 31.6% died during the index emergency department visit. Vascular conditions associated with death were venous thromboembolism (31.6%), ruptured aortic aneurysm (21.1%), aortic dissection (21.1%), other aortic causes (10.5%), vascular trauma (10.5%), and bowel ischemia (5.3%). Although the frequency of vascular-related EMTALA violations was low, improvements in communication, awareness of vascular disease among staff, specialty staffing, and the development of referral networks and processes are needed to ensure that patients receive adequate care and that institutions are not placed at undue risk."

Our purpose was to investigate the risk factors of mortality in AAAD surgery patients who had severe postoperative hyperbilirubinemia and AKI receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Patients who had severe hyperbilirubinemia and received CRRT after AAAD surgery in our center between January 2015 and December 2018 were retrospectively screened. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the risk factors of in-hospital mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves were employed to evaluate the accumulated patient survival proportion. After screening, 50 patients were included in our present study. The in-hospital mortality was 84%. The univariate logistic analysis showed that preoperative MAP (p = .017) and peak total bilirubin concentration (p < .001) were associated with in-hospital mortality in AAAD surgery patients who had severe postoperative hyperbilirubinemia and received CRRT. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the peak bilirubin concentration (odds ratio, 1.050; 95% confidence interval, 1.002-1.101; p = .041) after surgery was the only independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality. The optimal cutoff value of peak bilirubin for predicting in-hospital mortality was 134.4 μmol/L. AAAD surgery patients with severe hyperbilirubinemia and AKI requiring CRRT had a poor prognosis. Increased postoperative peak bilirubin concentration strongly increased the risk of patient in-hospital mortality. Therefore, these patients should be closely monitored and treated aggressively when possible."

    "abstract": "Type B aortic dissection (TBAD) occurs seldomly, particularly in pregnancy, but has disastrous consequences for both mother and fetus. The focus of immediate surgical repair of type A aortic dissection due to higher mortality of patients is less clear in its counterpart, TBAD, in which management is controversial and debated. This article collates knowledge so far on this rare event during pregnancy. A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Embase, and Medline. Key search terms included \"type B aortic dissection,\" \"pregnancy,\" and corresponding synonyms. Non-English papers were excluded. Risk factors for TBAD include aortic wall stress due to hypertension, previous cardiac surgery, structural abnormalities (bicuspid aortic valve, aortic coarctation), and connective tissue disorders. In pregnancy, pre-eclampsia is a cause of increased aortic wall stress. Management of this condition is often conservative, but this is dependent on a number of factors, including gestation, cardiovascular stability of the patient, and symptomology. In most cases, a cesarean section before intervention is carried out unless certain indications are present. Due to a scarce number of cases across the decades, it is difficult to determine which management is optimal. The gold-standard management of TBAD has traditionally been the medical treatment for uncomplicated cases and open surgery for those needing urgent intervention, but with the advent of techniques, such as thoracic endovascular aortic repair, the management of these group of patients continues to develop."

The mean age was 51.2 ± 10.2 years with a male predominance (85.7%). The mean time interval from aortic valve replacement to the present surgery was 10.62 years. One patient died in immediate postoperative period who was taken up for emergency surgery-acute type A aortic dissection.

No cardiac or aortic reinterventions were performed during follow up with a 100% freedom from reoperation at 5 years. Fifteen patients (71.43%) had aortopathy and had borderline pathology at the time of first surgery, with all of them having a tear either in the aortic sinuses or pervious aortotomy site. The favorable short and midterm results suggests that prosthetic valve sparing aortic root replacement is a valid option when possible. Utmost care has to be taken at the primary surgery especially in patients with aortopathy, trying to avoid the need for a second surgery."

Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are critical in treating patients with AD. In the emergency department, patients with AD commonly present with classic symptoms of unanticipated severe chest or back pain. However, it is worth noting that atypical symptoms of AD are easily misdiagnosed. A 51-year-old woman was first diagnosed with scapulohumeral periarthritis due to left shoulder pain. After careful examination of her previous medical history and contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography, the patient was diagnosed with a new type A AD after chronic type B dissection in the ascending aorta. The patient was successfully treated with surgical replacement of the dissected aortic arch and remains in good health. New retrograde type A AD after chronic type B dissection is relatively rare. It is worth noting that a physician who has a patient with suspected AD should be vigilant. Both patient medical history and imaging tests are crucial for a more precise diagnosis."

There were 122 patients (38%) with moderate-to-severe AR, of whom 82 (67%) underwent Liu's aortic root repair and valve preservation. Aortic computed tomography angiography and echocardiography were performed at discharge, 6 and 12 months postoperatively, and annually thereafter. We focused on assessing the survival and aortic root and valve durability in the 82 patients. The 30-day, 1-year, 3-year and 6-year survival estimates were 94%, 90%, 85% and 81%, respectively. At a median follow-up of 36.5 (interquartile range 24.9-50.9) months, all patients were free from reoperation. No residual false lumens in the aortic root, recurrent aortic root dissections or aortic root pseudoaneurysms were observed during the follow-up period. Only 1 patient (1%) presented with moderate AR at 6 months, which remained asymptomatic with no significant changes over a 3-year period. The remaining patients showed satisfactory valve function with an AR grade of mild (27%) or trace or none (72%). In the competing risk analysis, the incidence of recurrence of AR was 2% at 8 years. Liu's aortic root repair and valve preservation is a safe and effective operative strategy that achieves favourable short- and medium-term outcomes for acute type A aortic dissection with moderate-to-severe AR."

Methods: The clinical data of the patients underwent peripheral vascular intervention via TRA in our hospital from September 2017 to March 2019 were reviewed. The success rate of radial artery puncture and subsequent operation after puncture, and related postoperative complications within 30 days were analyzed. Results: The clinical data of 112 peripheral arterial intervention procedures via TRA performed on 106 patients were reviewed, including transcatheter arterial chemoembolization in 83 cases, bronchial arterial infusion in 4 cases, pelvic tumor embolization in 11 cases and 14 other cases. The success rate of all interventional punctures was 97.3% (109/112), the operative success rate of interventional procedures was 98.2% (107/109). The TRA operation was failed in 5 patients, who were then converted to receive the femoral artery puncture and complete successfully. The severe complication of the operation was aortic dissection (2 cases). Minor complications included 2 cases of radial artery occlusion, radial artery spasm, arm pain and puncture point hematoma for each case. The severe complication and the minor complication rates were 1.8% (2/112) and 4.5% (5/112), respectively. Sixteen emergency operations were performed successfully, and no complication occurred.

    "title": "Open Repair of Acute Type A Intramural Hematoma in 3 Patients.",
    "abstract": "Acute aortic syndrome encompasses classic aortic dissection and less common aortic phenomena, including intramural hematoma (IMH), a hemorrhage within the aortic media that occurs without a discrete intimal tear. We reviewed our experience with treating acute type A IMH to better understand this acute aortic syndrome. A review of our clinical database identified 1,902 proximal aortic repairs that were performed from January 2006 through December 2018; of these, 266 were for acute aortic syndrome, including 3 (1.1%) for acute type A IMH. Operative technique varied considerably. All IMH repairs involved hemiarch or total arch replacement. In all 3 patients, the IMH extended distally into the descending thoracic aorta. There were no operative deaths or major adverse events (stroke, paraplegia, paraparesis, or renal failure necessitating dialysis) that persisted to hospital discharge. Length of hospitalization ranged from 5 to 20 days. All 3 patients were alive at follow-up (range, 2-6 yr) and needed no aortic reintervention after their index or staged repairs. In our experience, repair of acute type A IMH was infrequent and could be either simple or complex. Despite our limited experience with this disease, we found that it can be repaired successfully in urgent and emergency cases. Following treatment guidelines for aortic dissection appears to be a reasonable strategy for treating IMH."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous haemothorax (SH) is a rare subcategory of haemothorax that involves the accumulation of blood within the pleural space in the absence of trauma. SH especially occurs in middle-aged or elderly patients, but data are usually limited to case reports and case series. Coagulopathy, aneurysm or aortic dissection, Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome and malignancy have to be considered among the causes of SH. We describe a case of primary angiosarcoma of the spleen presenting as relapsing haemothorax. An 81-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of a 2-month history of relapsing haemothorax after the performance of urgent splenectomy due to active bleeding from large spleen cysts. No evidence of neoplasm was seen after pathological examination of the spleen. On admission, left haemothorax and 2 new cystic masses in the thoracic wall were documented, both in close relation to the scars of previous surgery and chest tubes. After excision of 1 mass, histological examination revealed angiosarcoma, and a final diagnosis of primary angiosarcoma of the spleen with postsurgical metastatic dissemination to the thorax and pleura was made. Primary angiosarcoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of haemorrhagic spleen cysts. Clinical diagnosis and management usually requires splenectomy, but it should be carefully planned in order to avoid local metastatic dissemination or haematogenous spread of the tumour. The differential diagnosis of spleen cysts must include malignant conditions.Despite its absolute rarity, angiosarcoma is considered the most common primary non-haematolymphoid splenic malignancy and has a poor prognosis.Splenectomy is usually required for a prompt diagnosis of primary angiosarcoma of the spleen, but it needs to be performed with extreme caution to avoid metastatic dissemination."

Multicentre study, with 19 participating centers, to define the impact of the pandemic on the provision of aortovascular services and patients' outcomes after having adapted the thresholds for intervention to guarantee access to treatment for emergency and urgent conditions. Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data, including all patients with aortovascular conditions admitted for surgical or conservative treatment from the 1st March to the 20th May 2020. A total of 189 patients were analyzed, and 182 underwent surgery. Diagnosis included: aneurysm (45%), acute aortic syndrome (44%), pseudoaneurysm (4%), aortic valve endocarditis (4%), and other (3%). Timing for surgery was: emergency (40%), urgent (34%), or elective (26%). In-hospital mortality was 12%. Thirteen patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the peri-operative period, and this subgroup was not associated with a higher mortality. There was a significant change in service provision for aortovascular patients in the UK. Although the emergency and urgent surgical activity were maintained, elective treatment was minimal during early months of the pandemic. The preoperative COVID-19 screening protocol, combined with self-isolation and shielding, contributed to the low incidence of COVID-19 in our series and a mortality similar to that of pre-pandemic outcomes."

    "abstract": "Standard surgical repair of acute type A aortic dissection is associated with high mortality rates, especially in high-risk patients. In an attempt to improve survival in frail patients, we evaluated the outcomes after ascending aorta wrapping in a high-risk patient cohort. This single-center retrospective cohort study included all consecutive patients treated using ascending aorta wrapping for an acute type A aortic dissection from 2008 to 2019. The primary end points included 30-day mortality, survival during follow-up, and dissection-related mortality. Secondary end points included assessment of aortic remodeling after ascending aorta wrapping. Patients with an aortic anatomy suitable for adjunctive endografting of the ascending aorta were also identified. Thirty-five consecutive patients who underwent ascending aorta wrapping were included. Their median age was 77 years (range, 46-96 years). The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 9%. Major complications occurred in 7 patients (21%), including early reinterventions in 11 (31%). Median follow-up was 36 months (range, 2.4-106.6; interquartile range, 72). The actuarial survival at 36 months was 82%. The dissection-related mortality was 11.4%. The median aortic growth of the nonwrapped descending thoracic aorta was 3.4 mm. Computed tomography scan analysis depicted that 88% of survivors were theoretical candidates for an additional endovascular procedure to exclude the primary entry tear. Aortic wrapping is associated with favorable early outcomes and a low rate of aortic events during follow-up. This therapeutic option should be considered for patients considered too fragile for standard surgical repair."

    "abstract": "The reversed elephant trunk technique permits staged repair of extensive thoracic aortic aneurysm in patients whose distal (ie, descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal) aorta is symptomatic or disproportionately large compared with their proximal aorta (ie, ascending aorta and transverse aortic arch). We present our 23-year experience with the reversed elephant trunk approach. Between 1994 and 2017, 94 patients (median age 62 [46-69] years) underwent stage 1 reversed elephant trunk repair of the distal aorta. Fifty-three patients (56%) had aortic dissection, and 31 patients (33%) had heritable thoracic aortic disease. Eighty-eight operations (94%) were Crawford extent I or II thoracoabdominal aortic repairs. Twenty-seven patients (29%) underwent subsequent stage 2 repair of the proximal aorta; 14 patients (52%) required redo median sternotomy. The median time between the stage 1 and 2 operations was 18.8 (4.8-69.3) months. The operative mortality was 10% (9/94) for stage 1 repairs and 4% (1/27) for stage 2 repairs; 1 patient with heritable thoracic aortic disease died after stage 1 repair (1/31, 3%), and 1 patient died after stage 2 repair (1/13, 8%). Two patients (2%) had ruptures after stage 1 repair; 1 resulted in death, and 1 precipitated emergency stage 2 repair. In total, 36 patients (38%) who survived stage 1 repair died before stage 2 reversed elephant trunk completion repair could be performed. Managing extensive aortic aneurysm with the 2-stage reversed elephant trunk technique yields acceptable short-term outcomes. This technique is useful for the reversed elephant trunk in patients who require distal aortic repair before proximal repair and is particularly effective in patients with heritable thoracic aortic disease. The low number of patients returning for completion repair is concerning. Rigorous surveillance is needed."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection type-A (AADA) is a life threatening condition which requires emergency surgery. Surgery is usually performed by cardiac surgeons with various levels of aortic surgical experience. We compared the short-term perioperative outcome and long-term survival of patients operated by specialist aortic surgeons (SASs)and those who were operated by surgeons without specialist expertise. A single center retrospective review of 232 patients who underwent acute surgery for AADA was conducted between 2005 and 2020. The cohort was divided into those operated on by SASs (Group A, n = 186) and those operated on by nonaortic surgeons (Group B, n = 46). Statistical comparison was done using regression modelling and groups were propensity matched. Kaplan-Meier comparison was undertaken using STATA14. Of 232 patients, 186 were operated on by an aortic specialist and 46 were operated by a nonaortic specialist. Overall 30-day mortality was 10% in Group A compared to 26.0% in Group B (unadjusted: p = .01, multivariate: p = .02, and propensity matched p = .05). Long-term mortality at 14 years was 26% in Group A compared to 52.0% in Group B (unadjusted: p = .001, multivariate: p = .001, and propensity matched: p = .01). Aortic surgeons performed a significantly higher number of aortic root procedures (43.0% vs. 17.3%, p = .001). The cross-clamp time and bypass time was significantly shorter in Group A patients (89 vs. 105 min, p < .01 and 153 vs. 185, p = < .001). Postoperative requirement for renal filtration was (19% vs. 37%, unadjusted p = .01, multivariate p = .03 and propensity matched p = .04). Although postoperative bleeding was less in Group A (4.0% vs. 11.0%, unadjusted p = .05) after propensity matching it was not statistically significant. In patients with AADA, surgery performed by aortic specialist's results in improved outcomes. Aortic specialists replaced more of dissected aorta, resulting in an increased number of complex procedures, which may explain improved long-term survival after AADA in this cohort. This study adds further support in establishing a specialist aortic surgical service in cardiac centers."

A 57-year-old patient with a contained rupture of the descending thoracic aorta, in the setting of a chronic type A dissection and a maximum aortic diameter of 85 mm, was converted to endovascular repair after failure of an open surgical approach. A custom-made triple-branched arch endograft designed for another patient was employed, with concomitant occlusion of the false lumen using a Candy Plug occluder. To adjust the graft's configuration to the patient's anatomy, the supra-aortic vessels were not assigned to the originally planned branches. The 12-month follow-up angiography demonstrated a satisfactory result. A noncustomized triple-branched arch endograft can be used in an emergency setting to treat chronic type A dissection, reassigning the branches to the supra-aortic vessels as needed."

Successful management of AD-related acute brain infarction with hypofibrinogenemia after IVT has not been reported previously. An 84-year-old woman developed sudden left limb weakness and aphasia for almost 4 h. Alteplase was administered intravenously immediately after cerebral hemorrhage was ruled out by emergent head computed tomography (CT). An anomaly suspected to be AD was detected during subsequent routine chest CT, which was confirmed by CT angiography to be a thoracoabdominal aortic dissecting aneurysm (DeBakey type I). Severe hypofibrinogenemia was also noted. After effective blood pressure control, intramuscular injection of vitamin K, and rehydration therapy, her brain cell metabolism improved, hemiplegia improved slightly, and hypofibrinogenemia recovered gradually. The patient's cerebral hemorrhage did not progress, there was no chest pain or no aggravation of hemiplegia, and the fibrinogen level gradually returned to normal. The condition was stable during hospitalization. At 1.5 months after discharge, the patient showed minimal change in condition. The symptoms of AD may be nonspecific and latent. IVT may be allowed to perform for some patients with AD related ischemical stroke, And IVT can improve the neural symptoms of AD-related ischemic stroke, but close monitoring is needed to avoid aneurysm rupture. Fibrinogen levels should also be monitored periodically after IVT for early detection of hypofibrinogenemia."

The primary end point was how the reduction of radiation dose affected image quality. The current study was performed over a period of 2 years between July, 2016 and July, 2018. This study included patients who presented to the Emergency Room or to an outpatient clinic and were suspected to have a coronary, a pulmonary (pulmonary embolism), or an aortic (aortic dissection) etiology. Suspicion was determined by the medical provider based on clinical picture, EKG, and lab results when available. All patients were referred for computed tomography angiography (CTA) testing as part of their diagnostic evaluation. A total of 84 patients were involved in the study. Seventy of the patients underwent the low acquisition Kvp technique (100 Kvp - Group I). In the remaining 14 patients, the standard acquisition technique (120-140 Kvp - Group II) was utilized. This study showed the feasibility of using low energy CTA to significantly reduce the patient's radiation exposure without markedly affecting the image quality and diagnostic accuracy. The use of low energy CTA protocols in cases of acute chest pain revealed no major difference regarding the image quality with marked reduction of the radiation dose received by the patient."

He had no notable paralysis symptoms on initial presentation. However, after AAR for AAD was performed, left paralysis developed within a few hours. Emergency angiography revealed right CAD and pseudo-occlusion. CAS was performed successfully using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). He was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital with a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 2.Case 2: A 55-year-old man underwent AAR for AAD, but asymptomatic left CAD remained. Two weeks after the operation, he presented with slight signs of aphasia. Aspirin was prescribed and follow-up was performed, but his symptoms did not improve. He underwent magnetic resonance imaging in our department, which revealed acute cerebral infarction on the left pars opercularis and an artery-to-artery embolism from CAD. CAS was performed via the retrograde approach with direct puncture of the normal left common carotid artery using IVUS. He was discharged with no complications and a mRS score of 1.

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection is a surgical emergency and management of such pathology can be complex with poor outcomes when there is organ malperfusion. Carotid artery involvement is present in 30% of patients diagnosed with acute type A aortic dissection, and given its emergency and complex nature, there is much controversy regarding the approach, extent of treatment, and timing of the intervention. It is clear that the occurrence of cerebral malperfusion adds an extra layer of complexity to the decision-making framework for treatment. Standardization and validation of the optimal management approach is required, and this should ideally be addressed with large-scale studies. Nonetheless, current literature supports the need for rapid recognition and diagnosis of acute type A aortic dissection with cerebral malperfusion, immediate and extensive surgical repair, and the appropriate use of cerebral perfusion techniques. This paper aims to discuss the current evidence regarding the impact of carotid artery involvement in both the management and outcomes of acute type A aortic dissection."

The aim of this study was to evaluate if the GERAADA score's prediction corresponds with the authors' institutional results. All consecutive AADA patients between 2010 and 2020 were included. Retrospective data collection comprised 11 preoperative parameters: age, sex, previous cardiac surgery, inotropic support at referral, resuscitation before surgery, aortic regurgitation, preoperative hemiparesis, intubation/ventilation at referral, preoperative organ malperfusion, extension of aortic dissection and location of primary entry site. Calculations of the GERAADA score were individually performed by a cardiac surgeon blinded to the study for all patients via a web-based application (https://www.dgthg.de/de/GERAADA_Score). A total of 371 AADA patients were operated at the authors' institution. The mean age was 62.7 ± 13.5 years and 233 (63%) were males. Prediction of 30-day mortality was accurate for the entire study cohort (actual vs predicted 30-day mortality: 15.1% vs 15.7%; P = 0.776) as well as for all 26 subgroups. In addition, preoperative resuscitation (P < 0.001), advanced age (P = 0.042) and other/unknown malperfusion (P = 0.032) were identified as independent risk factors. The GERAADA score prediction of 30-day mortality after surgery is accurate, easily accessible due to its web-based platform and can be calculated with very basic preoperative clinical parameters. A prospective clinical trial is required to further evaluate the new GERAADA score as a useful tool to allow for improved decision-making in the emergency setting of AADA."

Few studies have been published on this issue, and none of them have discussed the effect of an altitude change (from high to low altitude) on a patient's physiology or its effects on a patient's perioperative management. Here, we present the case of a 46-year-old man who was a long-time resident of Tibetan area in Sichuan (altitude >3000 m) who underwent Stanford type A aortic dissection emergency surgery on the plain. Anesthetic management occurred through monitoring of the bispectral index (BIS) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), and we used a relatively loose fluid hydration strategy. The surgery was performed using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), deep hypothermia (DH), and selective antegrade cerebral perfusion. The most prominent anesthesia challenges for these patients are physiological changes due to habitation in an high-altitude environment (chronic hypoxemia), which can cause hyperhemoglobinemia, polycythemia, hypercoagulable blood, and even pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, or congestive heart failure. Optimized perioperative management and close cooperation among the entire cardiac medical team were the key factors in the successful management of this rare case."

    "abstract": "Type B aortic dissection (TBAD) complicated by malperfusion carries high morbidity and mortality. The present study was undertaken to compare the characteristics of malperfusion and uncomplicated cohorts and to evaluate the long-term differences in survival using a granular, national registry. Patients with TBAD entered into the thoracic endovascular aortic repair/complex endovascular aortic repair module of the Vascular Quality Initiative from 2010 to 2019 were included. The demographic, radiographic, operative, postoperative, in-hospital, and long-term reintervention data were compared between the malperfusion and uncomplicated TBAD groups using t tests and χ2 analysis, as appropriate. Overall survival was compared using Cox regression to generate survival curves. Of the 2820 included patients, 2267 had uncomplicated TBAD and 553 had malperfusion. The patients with malperfusion were younger (age, 55.8 vs 61.2 years; P < .001), were more often male (79.7% vs 68.1%; P < .001), had a higher preoperative creatinine (1.8 vs 1.1 mg/dL; P < .001), had more often presented with an American Society of Anesthesiologists class of 4 or 5 (81.9% vs 58.4%; P < .001), and had more often presented with urgent status (77.4% vs 32.8%; P < .001). In contrast, the uncomplicated TBAD group had had more medical comorbidities, including coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a larger aortic diameter (4.0 cm vs 4.9 cm; P < .001). The malperfusion group more frequently had proximal zones of disease in zones 0 to 2 (38.6% vs 31.5%; P = .002) and distal zones of disease in zones 9 and above (78.7% vs 46.2%; P < .001), with a greater number of aortic zones traversed (7.7 vs 5.1; P < .001) and a greater frequency of dissection extension into branch vessels (61.8% vs 23.1%; P < .001). Patients with malperfusion also exhibited greater case complexity, with a greater need for branch vessel stenting and longer procedure times. The overall incidence of postoperative complications was greater in the malperfusion group (39.4% vs 17.1%; P < .001) and included a greater rate of spinal cord ischemia (6.3% vs 2.2%; P < .001), acute kidney injury (10.4% vs 0.9%; P < .001), and in-hospital mortality (11.6% vs 5.6%; P < .001). In-hospital reintervention was also greater for the malperfusion patients (14.5% vs 7.4%; P < .001), although the incidence of long-term reinterventions was similar between the two groups (8.7% vs 9.7%; P = .548). A proximal zone of disease in zone 0 to 2 was associated with decreased survival. In contrast, a distal zone of disease in 9 and above, in-hospital reintervention, and long-term follow-up were associated with increased survival. Despite these differences, long-term survival did not differ between the malperfusion and uncomplicated groups (P = .320.) CONCLUSIONS: Patients presenting with TBAD and malperfusion represent a unique cohort. Despite the greater need for branch vessel stenting and in-hospital reintervention, they had similar long-term reintervention rates and survival compared with those with uncomplicated TBAD. These data lend insight with regard to the observed differences between uncomplicated and malperfusion TBAD."

    "abstract": "Patients with a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) often present with a dilated ascending aorta. However, the underlying pathogenesis for the observed changes in the aortic wall and the resulting aneurysmal dilation remains a subject of debate. This study aims to compare the histological abnormalities of the ascending aorta in BAV and tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) patients and their correlation with aortic diameter and patient age. A total of 376 patients from our institution's clinical database were included in the retrospective analysis. These patients underwent either elective surgery for ascending aorta dilation or emergency surgery for aortic dissection, either isolated or with a structurally diseased aortic valve. After excision, the ascending aorta samples were analysed by a pathologist. On histological examination, a higher degree of elastic fibre fragmentation and loss and mucoid extracellular matrix accumulation was present in the samples from TAV patients when compared with that from BAV patients (P < 0.001). However, correlation was poor for all variables when considering aortic diameter and histological abnormalities or age and histological abnormalities in both BAV and TAV patients. Our study demonstrates a greater incidence of severe histological abnormalities in TAV patients when compared with BAV patients."

    "abstract": "Approximately 1% of primary care office visits are for chest pain, and 2% to 4% of these patients will have unstable angina or myocardial infarction. Initial evaluation is based on determining whether the patient needs to be referred to a higher level of care to rule out acute coronary syndrome (ACS). A combination of age, sex, and type of chest pain can predict the likelihood of coronary artery disease as the cause of chest pain. The Marburg Heart Score and the INTERCHEST clinical decision rule can also help estimate ACS risk. Twelve-lead electrocardiography is recommended to look for ST segment changes, new-onset left bundle branch block, presence of Q waves, and new T-wave inversions. Patients with suspicion of ACS or changes on electrocardiography should be transported immediately to the emergency department. Those at low or intermediate risk of ACS can undergo exercise stress testing, coronary computed tomography angiography, or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. In those with low suspicion for ACS, consider other diagnoses such as chest wall pain or costochondritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and panic disorder or anxiety states. Other less common, but important, diagnostic considerations include acute pericarditis, pneumonia, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and acute thoracic aortic dissection."

    "abstract": "Type A aortic dissection, according to Stanford classification, is a surgical emergency with high morbidity and carries 56% of in-hospital mortality when surgical intervention is not performed. The surgical mortality at 30 days is 10 to 20%. The therapeutic goals are to replace the diseased ascending aorta and to treat or to monitor the distal aortic patent false lumen. When the dissection involves the aortic root and the architecture of aortic valve is normal, the surgical techniques used could be multiple: reinforce the aortic root and spare the native aortic valve or replace the aortic valve and the aortic root. The Florida sleeve technique has been developed to treat the aortic aneurysm, sparing the aortic valve in patients with connective tissue disease. Some case reports have described the use of this technique to treat an acute aortic dissection. In the following case, we present a single stage repair of the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and proximal intrathoracic aorta in a patient with Type A aortic dissection through the contemporaneous use of two techniques: Florida sleeve and Vascutek \"Thoraflex\" hybrid prosthesis. The use of these two techniques allows the repair/replacement of the proximal intrathoracic aorta, the sparing of the native aortic valve, the employment of a hybrid prosthesis to replace the supraortic vessels, and the creation of a descending aortic landing zone for later, distal intervention."

    "abstract": "To review the currently available literature to define the role of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in patients with connective tissue disorders (CTD). A comprehensive electronic database search was performed in PubMed, SCOPUS, Embase, Google scholar, and OVID to identify all the articles that reported on outcomes of utilizing TEVAR in patients with CTD during elective and emergency settings. The search was not limited to time or language of the published study. All the relevant studies have been summarized in its correspondence section. The outcomes were analyzed in narrative format. The role of TEVAR has been elaborated as per each study. Currently, there is limited large cohort size studies outlining the use of TEVAR in patients with CTD. The use of endovascular repair in patients with CTD is limited due to progressive aortic dilatations and high possibility of further reinterventions at later stage of life. Open repair remains the gold standard method of intervention in young patients with progressive CTD, especially in the setting of acute type A aortic dissection. However, TEVAR can be sought as a reliable alternative in emergency setting of diseases involving the descending thoracic aorta; yet the long-term data needs to be published to support such practice."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a devastating surgical emergency, with high operative mortality. Several scoring algorithms have been used to establish the expected mortality in these patients. Our objective was to define the predictive factors for mortality in our center and to validate the EuroSCORE and Penn classification system. Patients who underwent surgery for AAD from 2006 to 2016 were retrieved from the institution's database. Preoperative, operative and postoperative variables were collected. Observed and expected mortality was calculated by EuroSCORE. Logistic regression analysis and Cox regression analysis were performed to find predictors of operative mortality and survival, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted for logistic EuroSCORE, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated. 87 patients (27.6% female) underwent surgery for AAD. The mean age was 58.6±9.7 years. Expected and observed operative mortality was 25.8±15.1% and 20.7%, respectively. Penn Aa, Ab and Abc shared similar observed/expected (O/E) mortality ratio. The only independent predictor of operative mortality (OR: 3.63; 95% CI: 1.19-11.09) and survival (HR: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.5-4.8) was female gender. EuroSCORE showed a very poor prediction capacity, with an AUC=0.566. Female gender was the only independent predictor of operative mortality and survival in our institution. EuroSCORE is a poor scoring algorithm to predict mortality in AAD, but with consistent results for Penn Aa, Ab and Abc."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is a cardiovascular emergency with an overall in-hospital mortality rate of 27.4%, and with every hour without intervention, the mortality rate increases by 1%-2% in the first 48 hours. Thoracic aortic dissection typically presents with tearing chest, back, or abdominal pain. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2), which has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) and usually manifests with respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, flu-like symptoms, and fever. This case report highlights an important impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the identification and management of aortic dissection in the emergency department. A 35-year-old Bahraini male, a suspected case of Marfan syndrome, presented with complaints of shortness of breath and worsening productive cough after returning from the United States (U.S). He denied any chest, back, or abdominal pain, dizziness, weakness in any limb, gait disturbance, headache, or change in vision. He was considered high risk for COVID-19 because of the recent travel and respiratory symptoms and was diagnosed incidentally with ascending aortic dissection along with a right lung consolidation. His SARS-Cov2 PCR came negative thrice during hospital stay, and he underwent elective cardiothoracic surgery. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a major stressor for the healthcare system worldwide, inflicting serious threats. Aortic dissection is one of the major life-threatening diseases that needs to be identified early on in the emergency department; however, in this case delayed diagnosis raised significant concerns due to underlying evolving triaging system for COVID-19 and atypical and overlapping clinical presentation. Further research is needed to look for COVID-19-associated factors, affecting the standard of care in the emergency department. Improving handover can directly impact patient care; therefore, it should be optimized."

    "abstract": "The pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) creates many challenges for the healthcare sector. Currently, little is known of how the pandemic has impacted patients with cardiovascular disease. The primary focus of this study was to determine whether emergency cardiovascular surgeries can be carried out safely during the COVID-19 pandemic. Between 17 January 2020 and 11 February 2020, 13 patients were admitted to Wuhan Union Hospital for emergency cardiovascular surgery. During this time, Wuhan was a COVID-19 epicenter, and Wuhan Union Hospital is a sentinel hospital located in this area. These patients' epidemiological histories, clinical records, laboratory assessments, imaging findings, and surgical outcomes were retrospectively reviewed. Throat swabs were collected from some patients preoperatively and all patients postoperatively for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing to determine whether these patients had COVID-19. This cohort included 5 cases of acute aortic dissection, 3 cases of congenital heart disease, 2 cases of dilated cardiomyopathy with end-stage heart failure, 1 case of aortocoronary fistula that had undergone previous surgery, 1 case of subacute infective endocarditis with cerebral infarction, and 1 case of multivessel coronary disease. Six patients were suspected COVID-19 cases (46.2%). There were no confirmed COVID-19 cases in this cohort. None of the patients in this cohort died and none developed severe acute respiratory syndrome, renal failure, or septic shock after surgery. No cross-infection occurred with other patients or medical staff who came into close contact with this cohort. Emergency surgery is crucial and unavoidable for many patients with acute and severe cardiovascular disease, regardless of the pandemic. Our study indicates that, with adequate preparation and the provision of appropriate treatment, satisfactory outcomes can be achieved for such patients."

The present study enrolled 712 consecutive patients diagnosed with TA-AAD and received aortic repair surgery at our hospital between January 2014 to December 2018. Clinical characteristics of enrolled patients were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were grouped by preexisting hypertension history and matched with propensity scores matching method. Patients' clinical characteristics were compared and analyzed before and after propensity scoring. To identify predictors for long-term mortality rate, Kaplan-Meier survival estimation and Cox proportional hazard analysis were performed. A total of 492 patients (69.1% of all patients in the cohort) were included in the hypertensive group and they had increased age and weight compared to patients in the non-hypertensive group. Between two groups, preoperative leukocyte count and serum creatinine level were found significant different (P<0.05). After propensity scoring, 128 pairs (256 patients) were successfully matched. Our analysis showed that there was no significant difference of ventilation duration, 30-day mortality rate, intensive care unit stay and hospitalization time between two groups. However, our data suggested that hypertensive patients presented with less intra-operative aortic valve involvement. There was a significant difference in long-term survival rate (P=0.037) between two groups. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that hypertension was an independent risk factor [hazard ratio (HR), 3.040; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.124-8.227; P=0.029]. Our data suggested that TA-AAD patients complicated with hypertension had increased age and weight compared to non-hypertensive patients. Concomitant hypertension identified upon hospital administration was an independent risk factor for long-term survival in TA-AAD patients while did not influence the 30-day mortality rate."

    "abstract": "Racial disparities in open thoracic aortic aneurysm repair have been well-documented, with Black patients reported to suffer from poor outcomes compared with their White counterparts. It is unclear whether these disparities extend to the less invasive thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). This study aims to examine the clinical characteristics, perioperative outcomes, and 1-year survival of Black vs White patients undergoing TEVAR in a national vascular surgery database. The Vascular Quality Initiative database was retrospectively queried to identify all patients who underwent TEVAR between January 2011 and December 2019. The primary outcomes were 30-day mortality and 1-year survival after TEVAR. Secondary outcomes included various types of major postoperative complications. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of 30-day mortality and perioperative complications. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to determine the predictors of 1-year survival. A total of 2669 patients with TEVAR were identified in the Vascular Quality Initiative, of whom 648 were Black patients (24.3%). Compared with White patients, Black patients were younger and had a higher burden of comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, dialysis dependence, and anemia. Black patients were more likely to be symptomatic, present with aortic dissection, and undergo urgent or emergent repair. There was no statistically significant difference in 30-day mortality between Black and White patients (3.4% vs 4.9%; P = .1). After adjustment for demographics, comorbidities, and operative factors, Black patients were independently associated with a 56% decrease in 30-day mortality risk compared with their White counterparts (odds ratio, 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.85; P = .01) and not associated with an increased risk of perioperative complications (odds ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.68-1.17; P = .42). Black patients also had a significantly better 1-year overall survival (log-rank, P = .024) and were associated with a significantly decreased 1-year mortality (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.47-0.91; P = .01) after adjusting for multiple clinical factors. Although Black patients carried a higher burden of comorbidities, the racial disparities in perioperative outcomes and 1-year survival do not persist in TEVAR."

Different clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and imaging features of patients with acute aortic dissection type A are the risk factors of preoperative mortality. This study aims to establish a simple and effective preoperative mortality risk assessment model for patients with acute aortic dissection type A. A total of 673 Chinese patients with acute aortic dissection type A who were admitted to our hospital were retrospectively included. All patients were unable to receive surgically treatment within 3 days from the onset of disease. The patients included were divided into the survivor and deceased groups, and the endpoint event was preoperative death. Multivariable analysis was used to investigate predictors of preoperative mortality and to develop a prediction model. Among the 673 patients, 527 patients survived (78.31%) and 146 patients died (21.69%). The developmental dataset had 505 patients, calibration by Hosmer Lemeshow was significant (χ2 = 3.260, df = 8, P = 0.917) and discrimination by area under ROC curve was 0.8448 (95% CI 0.8007-0.8888).

An annular abscess surrounding the prosthetic aortic valve was observed, and the valve was detached. For destruction of the entire aortic annulus, we performed an aortic valve translocation procedure. Revascularization of the left coronary artery was performed by interposing an 8 mm artificial graft between the proximal anastomosis site of the previous venous graft and the composite tube graft. Revascularization of the right coronary artery was performed using a saphenous vein graft. The patient was discharged uneventfully at postoperative day 29 and doing well 1 year after surgery."

Methods: The clinical data of 30 patients suffering from TAI who were admitted to Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, General Hospital of Eastern Theater Command from January 2010 to December 2018 were summarized and analyzed retrospectively. All patients were diagnosed as TAI by aortic CT angiography. There were 20 males and 10 females, aging (46.4±15.2) years (range: 17 to 76 years). One patient was diagnosed as extensive intramural hematoma (IMH). The other 29 cases had aortic intimal injury, and the primary intimal tear of all these patients was located in the isthmus of descending aorta. There were 2 cases of ulcer-like changes combined with IMH, and 27 cases of traumatic aortic dissection (TAD) including 23 cases of localized TAD and 4 cases of extensive TAD. Endovascular repair, artificial vascular replacement or conservative treatment were performed according to the patient's specific condition. The patients were followed up in outpatient or by telephone. The clinical data of all the patients of the in-hospital treatment and during follow-up period was analyzed retrospectively. Results: One patient with IMH was treated conservatively. Surgical intervention was performed in 29 cases with intimal injury, of which 14 cases underwent emergency surgery on the day of admission or the next day, and 15 cases underwent elective surgery. Twenty-seven cases underwent thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), and 2 cases underwent artificial vascular replacement. Nine cases suffered combined operations in early or late stage. All patients were cured and discharged with in-hospital stay of (13.2±5.4) days (range: 7 to 30 days). There was no in-hospital death. Two patients underwent tracheotomy, and the rest had no serious complications. Up to the last follow-up in June 2019, 4 patients were lost to follow-up, and the remaining 26 patients were followed up for (50.6±34.1) months (range: 6 to 112 months) and survived healthily without new aortic events. Conclusions: Most of TAD cases are ascribed to Stanford type B aortic dissection, and a satisfactory short-term and mid-term result can be achieved by emergency TEVAR in most patients. Some patients can achieve good long-term results by open surgery with artificial vascular replacement. 目的： 探讨创伤性主动脉损伤的治疗方法和近中期效果。 方法： 回顾性分析2010年1月至2018年12月东部战区总医院心胸外科收治的30例创伤性主动脉损伤患者的临床资料。男性20例，女性10例，年龄（46.4±15.2）岁（范围：17~76岁）。所有患者经主动脉CT血管造影确诊为创伤性主动脉损伤。1例患者未见明确内膜损伤，诊断为广泛型壁间血肿，余29例有明确主动脉内膜损伤，原发内膜破口均位于降主动脉峡部，2例为溃疡样改变合并壁间血肿，27例为主动脉夹层，其中局限型主动脉夹层23例、广泛型主动脉夹层4例。根据患者具体病情行腔内修复、人工血管置换或保守治疗。出院后行门诊和电话随访。对患者在院期间治疗的临床资料和随访情况进行回顾性统计分析。 结果： 1例广泛型壁间血肿患者行保守治疗，29例主动脉内膜损伤患者行外科干预。其中15例于入院当天或次日行急诊手术，14例行择期手术；27例行主动脉腔内修复术，2例行开放胸主动脉人工血管置换术；9例先期或后期行其他部位手术。所有患者治愈出院，无在院死亡，住院时间（13.2±5.4）d（范围：7~30 d）。2例气管切开，余无严重并发症。至2019年6月最后一次随访，4例患者失访，余26例患者随访时间（50.6±34.1）个月（范围：6~112个月），均存活，无新发主动脉相关事件。 结论： 绝大多数创伤性主动脉夹层为Stanford B型夹层，急诊腔内修复可获得良好的近中期效果，部分患者采用开放性人工血管置换术有望获得良好的远期效果。."

The diagnosis of AKI was made based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes definition (KDIGO) criteria. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for postoperative AKI. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to compare the long-term outcomes between patients with and without AKI complication after TA-AAD surgeries. Among all enrolled patients, 114 (53.3%) developed AKI during postoperative period. The median age of patients with or without AKI was 68.0 (64.0, 74.0) and 66.0 (62.0, 72.8) years respectively. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) was required in 43 patients (20.1%). The 30-day mortality rate was 21.5% in all enrolled patients with 26.3% in AKI group and 16.0% in non-AKI group (P=0.067) respectively. Longer mechanical ventilation duration was identified as the only independent risk factor for developing AKI by multivariable logistic regression analysis. In addition, our data suggested that the long-term cumulative survival rate was different between two groups. Postoperative AKI after TA-AAD surgeries was common and associated with worsened long-term mortality in elderly patients. Longer postoperative mechanical ventilation duration was identified as the only independent risk factor for the development of AKI."

    "abstract": "The surgical strategy for acute type A aortic dissection (AADA) usually consists of reconstruction of the tear-lesion in the affected part of the ascending aorta. The optimal strategy either to replace the ascending aorta (AAR) or to replace the ascending aorta and the total aortic arch (TAAR) is still under debate. Our study compares the 30-day mortality between AAR and TAAR in AADA surgery. In this retrospective observational study, we analysed a total patient cohort of 339 patients who underwent surgery for AADA from January 2001 until December 2016. A propensity score-matched analysis between the AAR- and the TAAR-group with 43 patients for each subgroup was subsequently carried out. A multivariable analysis was performed to identify risk-factors for the 30-d-mortality. The 30-day mortality was defined as the primary end-point and long-term survival was the secondary endpoint. In 292 (86.1%) patients AAR and in 47 (13.9%) patients TAAR was performed for emergent AADA. Patients were older (P=0.049) in the AAR group. The median log Euro-SCORE was 25.5% (12.7; 41.7) for AAR and 19.7% (11.7; 32.2) for the TAAR patient cohort (P=0.12). Operative time, cardiopulmonary bypass- (CPB), cross-clamp- and ischemic time were significantly longer in the TAAR group (P<0.001). The overall 30-day mortality-rate was 17.7% (n=60) but was not significantly different between the two groups (P=0.27). Forty-nine (16.8%) patients died in the AAR and 11 patients (23.4%) in the TAAR group. After propensity-score matching, no difference in mortality was seen between the subgroups as well (P=0.44). Multivariable analysis identified the Euro-SCORE, long operation-time, postoperative dialysis and arrhythmia and administration of red blood cell concentrates as risk factors for 30-day mortality, but not for TAAR versus AAR. The therapeutic goal in AADA surgery should be the complete restoration of the aorta to avoid further long-term complications and re-operations. Though 30-day mortality and postoperative co-morbidity for AAR are comparable to those in TAAR after treatment of AADA in our analysis, decision-making for the surgical strategy should weigh the operative risk of TAAR against the long-term outcome."

The frozen elephant trunk technique and thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) enable the closure of the primary entry in the descending aorta. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of resection or closure of primary entry, i.e. entry exclusion, in patients with DeBakey type III retrograde-AAAD. The medical records of 654 patients with AAAD who underwent emergency surgery between January 2000 and March 2019 were retrospectively reviewed, and 80 eligible patients with DeBakey type III retrograde-AAAD were divided into the excluded (n = 50; age, 62 ± 12 years) and residual (n = 30; age, 66 ± 14 years) groups according to postoperative computed tomography angiographic data of the false lumen around the primary entry. The excluded group was defined as having a postoperative false lumen at the level of the elephant trunk or thrombosis of the endograft including primary entry. Patients with early false lumen enhancement around the elephant trunk or an unresected primary entry tear after isolated hemiarch replacement were included in the residual group. The early and long-term surgical outcomes were compared between the groups. The in-hospital mortality rate was 8% (6/80), with no significant difference observed between the excluded and the residual groups (10% and 7%, respectively; P > 0.99). Ninety-five percentage of the patients (20/21) achieved entry exclusion with stent grafts including the frozen elephant trunk procedure and TEVAR. Spinal cord ischaemia was not observed in either group. The cumulative overall survival at 5 years was comparable between the 2 groups (76% and 81% in the excluded and residual groups, respectively; P = 0.93). The 5-year freedom from distal aortic reoperation rate was significantly higher in the excluded group (97%) than in the residual group (97% vs 66%; P = 0.008). Not only resection but also closure using the entry exclusion approach for DeBakey type III retrograde-AAAD utilizing new technologies including the frozen elephant trunk technique and TEVAR might mitigate dissection-related reoperations."

    "abstract": "Iatrogenic aorto-coronary dissection (ICD) is one of the most feared complications of interventional cardiology. Although rare, it is characterized by anterograde coronary ischemia and a concomitant aortic dissection, with potentially fatal consequences. We present an example case of IACD and an accurate case-series review of the literature including 125 published cases. There were no significant predisposing factors and the IACD occurred equally in elective and urgent procedures. A significant number of IACDs were associated with CTO procedures. The factors associated with a worse outcome were hemodynamic instability, the presence of anterograde ischemia, and the extent of dissection according to the Dunning classification. Bail-out stenting was the most used strategy and its failure was associated with mortality. The main features of IACD are anterograde ischemia, retrograde dissection, and hemodynamic instability, each of them should be addressed with no time delay, possibly with bailout stenting, the most employed exit-strategy. According to our proposed algorithm, a shock team approach is required to coordinate the interdisciplinary skills and enabled patients to receive the best treatment."

    "abstract": "The patient was a 68-year-old man who underwent triple-vessel OPCAB uneventfully with aortic proximal anastomosis at one site using the saphenous vein with a mechanical device, not a side clamp, with mild traction of the ascending aorta by aortic taping. On postoperative day 7, computed tomography revealed extremely localized AAD with a tear on the posterior wall of the ascending aorta. Emergent ascending aortic replacement was successfully performed. Surprisingly, the tear extended laterally along the traction site of the tape. To our knowledge, this is the first report of AAD early after OPCAB originating at a location other than the sites of proximal anastomosis or side clamping. Proximal anastomosis with a mechanical device to the towed aorta may indirectly or directly injure the intima of the posterior wall, causing this complication. Manipulating the aorta under abnormal pressure should be avoided."

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has substantially disrupted many processes of care related to emergency cardiac conditions, while there has been no clinical guidance regarding the management of type A aortic dissection. A retrospective multicenter study involving 52 consecutive patients (mean age 52.3, 28.9% women) with type A aortic dissection during COVID-19 pandemic was conducted at tertiary aortic centers in Michigan, Wuhan and Changsha (China). Twenty-four (46.2%) were considered clinically suspicious for COVID-19 based on radiographic lung lesions (70.8%) followed by dyspnea (25.0%), cough (12.5%), and fever (12.5%). Overall, 47 (90.4%) underwent an operation and 5 (9.6%) managed nonoperatively. All suspected patients underwent a reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction at arrival, whereas 82.1% in the nonsuspected (P = 0.054). Among the 24 patients either nonoperatively managed or whose operation was delayed for >24 hours, only 1 (4.2%) died. A total of 3 (6.4%) operated patients had a positive reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction at various timings, including 1 nonsuspected patient preoperatively and 2 with very recent COVID-19 infection. The first patient died of respiratory failure despite uneventful surgical repair and maximal medical management. The postoperative course of both patients with recent COVID-19 was characterized by severe coagulopathy requiring massive transfusions and prolonged ICU stay. However, both survived to hospital discharge. In light of the possible dismal outcomes associated with dual diagnoses of type A aortic dissection/COVID-19 and the higher-than-expected number of asymptomatic carriers, all type A dissection patients should be immediately tested for COVID-19. Surgical interventions in patients recovered from recent COVID-19 may be safe."

    "abstract": "Tissue hypoperfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) affects cardiac surgical outcomes. Lactate, an end product of anaerobic glycolysis from oxygen deficit, is a marker of tissue hypoxia. In this study, we aimed to identify the prognostic value of blood lactate level during CPB in predicting outcomes in adults undergoing cardiac surgeries. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent cardiac surgeries with CPB from January 2015 to December 2015. Data about the characteristics of patients, preoperative status, type of surgery, and intraoperative lactate levels were collected. The outcomes were in-hospital mortality and complications. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were used to assess the ability of peak lactate level during CPB in predicting in-hospital mortality. A total of 97 patients, including 61 who underwent emergent or urgent surgery, were enrolled. The types of surgery included coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG, n = 52), valve surgery (n = 27), combined surgery (CABG and valve surgery, n = 4), great vessel surgery (including aortic dissection, n = 9), and others (n = 5). The median CPB time was 139 min (interquartile range = 120-175). The median initial lactate and peak lactate levels during CPB were 0.9 and 4.2 mmol/L, respectively. In-hospital mortality was 14.4%, which was significantly associated with age and peak lactate level in the multivariate logistic regression model. When the peak lactate level during CPB reached 7.25 mmol/L, in-hospital mortality could be predicted with an area under the ROC curve of 0.75 (95% confidence interval: 0.59-0.90; P = 0.003), with a sensitivity of 57% and specificity of 93%. Hyperlactatemia during CPB was associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Thus, early detection of such conditions and aggressive postoperative care are important."

    "abstract": "Between 2013 and 2015, cardiovascular diseases became one of the two leading causes of maternal mortality, with 36 deaths (13.7% of maternal deaths). The overall maternal mortality ratio for cardiovascular diseases is 1.5 per 100,000 live births, stable compared to the 2010-2012 period. The etiologies in order of decreasing frequency are: pre-existing cardiomyopathies (n=10), aortic dissections (n=9), peripartum cardiomyopathies (n=6), myocardial infarction (n=4), valvular cardiopathies (n=4). Non-optimal care occurred in 72% of cases, increasing since the previous triennium (50%). Similarly, there is a significant increase in the proportion of preventable deaths (possibly or probably) from 35% to 66%. In women with known cardiovascular disease, the lack of multidisciplinary prepregnancy assessment and pregnancy follow-up is most frequent. In patients with unknown cardiovascular disease, the lack of diagnosis of a cardiac event is the most common failure. Cardiovascular conditions or cardiovascular risk factors should be investigated in early pregnancy in order to monitor and refer women to appropriate maternity hospitals. Recent dyspnea, worsening at the end of pregnancy and postpartum, should suggest a cardiac complication. In presence of chest pain, aortic dissection should be considered with the same degree of emergency as myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism. Cardiac ultrasonography, chest CT, Nt-proBNP and troponin should be considered in case of chest pain or recent dyspnea. Women with cardiac symptoms should be referred to an emergency department (not necessarily to the local maternity) for a complete cardiovascular check-up."

From February 2011 to August 2018, 31 of 1,806 patients (1.7%) who underwent thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) with double PSGs (DPSGs) (n = 20) or triple PSGs (TPSGs) (n = 11) were retrospectively reviewed. Procedures were performed in high-risk patients who had TAA or AD involving zone 1 or zone 0. Fifteen patients (48.4%) who presented with symptomatic or impending rupture underwent urgent or emergent TEVAR with DPSGs or TPSGs. Nineteen patients (61.3%) were treated for zone 0 disease. Technical and clinical success rates were 70.0% for DPSG cohort and 45.5% for TPSG cohort. Intraoperative type Ia endoleak was observed in 30% of DPSG cohort and 45.5% of TPSG cohort. One patient in the DPSG cohort died of aortic sinus rupture intraoperatively. Minor stroke during the 30-day postoperative period was more frequent in the TPSG cohort (P = .042). Mean duration of follow-up was 28.9 months ± 17.7. The TPSG cohort had a higher incidence of major adverse events (72.7% vs 25.0%, P = .021). The most common adverse events were endoleaks (12.9%), endograft migration (9.7%), PSG stenosis or occlusion (6.5%), retrograde dissection (6.5%), and stroke (3.2%). Endograft migrations were more common in TPSG cohort (27.3%, P = .037). Overall mortality rate was 16.1% (5/31) perioperatively and during follow-up. There were no statistical differences in overall survival and reintervention-free survival. In the context of TEVAR with multiple PSGs for aortic arch repair, TPSGs may have a high risk of major complications."

The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was queried from 1998 to 2011 for patients with diagnoses of thoracic aneurysm and/or dissection who underwent open mediastinal repair. A total of 103,860 patients were identified. A total of 1,430 patients had prior cardiac surgery. Patients were further stratified into groups by institutional aortic volume: low (<12 cases/year), medium (12-39 cases/year), and high (40+ cases/year) volume. Multivariable risk-adjusted analysis accounting for emergent status and aortic dissection among other factors was performed to determine the impact of institutional volume on mortality. Overall mortality was 12% in the reoperative population. When the redo cohort was divided into tertiles, high-volume group had a 5% operative mortality compared with 9 and 15% for the medium- and low-volume groups, respectively. Multivariable analysis revealed that patients operated on at low- (odds ratio [OR] = 5.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.6-9.6, p < 0.001) and medium-volume centers (OR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.1-4.2, p = 0.03) had higher odds of mortality when compared with patients operated on at high-volume centers. High-volume aortic centers can significantly reduce mortality for reoperative aortic surgery, compared with lower volume institutions."

From 17 January 2020 to 8 March 2020, a total of 27 patients with TAAD were operated on in 8 cardiovascular surgery centres in Hubei Province (COVID-19 group). The data from 91 patients with TAAD from the same centres during the same period last year were extracted from the Hubei Cardiac Surgery Registration System (control group). A propensity score matched subgroup of 26 pairs (1:2) was identified. Perioperative data and short-term outcomes were assessed. Nine patients in the COVID-19 group were categorized as suspicious for the disease (9/27, 33.3%), and others were excluded (18/27, 66.7%). No one was laboratory confirmed preoperatively. The average waiting, cross-clamp and circulatory arrest times were longer in the COVID-19 group (22.9 ± 8.3 vs 9.7 ± 4.0 h, P < 0.001; 135 ± 36 vs 103 ± 45 min, P = 0.003; 24 ± 9 vs 17 ± 8 min, P < 0.001, respectively). The 30-day or in-hospital deaths were 3.8% in both groups (P = 1.0).

There were no statistical differences between the 2 groups in the incidence of complications such as stroke, neurological deficit, acute kidney injury, pulmonary infection and reoperation. Serum antibody tests for those patients showed 7 out of 9 suspected cases were Immunoglobulin G positive. No cross-infection occurred in other patients or associated medical staff. With adequate preparation and appropriate protection, satisfactory early outcomes can be achieved after emergency operations for patients with TAAD during the COVID-19 pandemic."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) is a medical emergency, in which acute destruction of aortic wall occurs with unknown etiology. Recent studies have uncovered the critical role of inteleukin-6 (IL-6) and inflammatory cells including macrophages in the disease mechanism of AD. IL-6 activates janus kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) to alter the gene expression program in many cell types, thus regulating various aspects of inflammatory response. We found that in human AD tissue, STAT3 was activated in infiltrating macrophages and in medial smooth muscle cells (SMCs), suggesting that STAT3 may regulate the response of these cell types. However, it is unknown how Stat3 regulates the cell type-specific response in pathogenesis of AD. The role of STAT3 was examined in genetically modified mice in which STAT3 sensitivity was enhanced specifically in macrophages or in SMCs by tissue-specific deletion of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (Socs3), a negative regulator of STAT3. Macrophage-specific deletion of Socs3 caused acute enhancement of STAT3 activation, M1-dominant differentiation of macrophages, suppression of tissue repair response of SMCs, and exaggerated AD. In contrast, SMC-specific deletion of Socs3 caused chronic STAT3 activation and low-grade inflammatory response in aortic walls, activation of fibroblasts, M2-dominant differentiation of macrophages, increase in adventitial collagen deposition, resulting in the protection of aorta from AD by reinforcing the tensile strength of the aortic walls. Therefore, STAT3 regulates the balance between the destruction and the reinforcement of the aortic tissue, depending on the cell types and the time course of STAT3 activation, which ultimately regulates the development of AD. Elucidating such a dynamic mechanism to regulate the aortic tissue integrity would be essential to decipher the molecular pathogenesis of AD."

AAD prompt and accurate evaluation and management are critical for survival as it is a cardiac surgical emergency. The initial treatment of AAD mandates strict blood pressure stabilization with intravenous antihypertensive medications. The progressive nature of the disease will increase the mortality as time elapses between diagnosis and surgical intervention. In addition, the patient's blood pressure control is challenged in the presence of renal failure requiring hemodialysis. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or named 2019-nCoV) pneumonia was a newly underrecognized illness (COVID-19 [coronavirus disease 2019]). COVID-19 can cause severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, heart injury, and liver dysfunction, which would aggravate the progress of aortic dissection.

    "abstract": "Delayed extubation after cardiac surgery is associated with high morbidity and mortality, increased intensive care unit length of stay, and healthcare cost. Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) generally results in prolonged mechanical ventilation due to the complexity of surgical management and some postoperative complications. This study aimed to elucidate the perioperative risk factors for delayed extubation in patients undergoing ATAAD surgery. A retrospective cohort study including 239 patients who were diagnosed with ATAAD and underwent emergency surgery from October 2004 to January 2018 was performed. The potential perioperative risk factors for delayed extubation were collected. This study defined delayed extubation as the time to commence extubation being greater than 48 hours. The clinical data were analyzed with univariate and multivariate analyses to identify risk factors for delayed extubation following ATAAD surgery. The incidence of delayed extubation was 48.5% (n=116). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed perioperative risk factors for delayed extubation included preoperative cardiac tamponade [odds ratio (OR) 3.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39-11.17, P=0.010], central arterial cannulation (ascending aorta and proximal aortic arch) for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (OR 4.04, 95% CI: 1.03-15.91, P=0.046), postoperative stroke (OR 10.58, 95% CI: 2.65-42.25, P=0.001), postoperative renal dysfunction that required temporary hemodialysis (OR 6.60 95% CI: 1.97-22.11, P=0.002), and re-exploration to stop bleeding (OR 2.65, 95% CI: 1.00-6.99, P=0.050). Preoperative cardiac tamponade, central arterial cannulation for CPB, postoperative stroke, postoperative renal dysfunction that required temporary hemodialysis, and re-exploration to stop bleeding are perioperative risk factors for delayed extubation. Identification of the potential risk factors for delayed extubation may help optimize the perioperative management and improve postoperative outcomes of patients undergoing ATAAD surgery."

All patients operated on in France between April 2016 and April 2019 for acute aortic syndromes and who had an frozen elephant trunk procedure with a THP were included in the study. The main end point was in-hospital mortality. The secondary end point was neuromorbidity, including paraplegia. The evolution of the main end point was monitored using a variable life-adjusted display graph with cumulative sum derivatives in order to stop inclusions in case the observed mortality became out of range compared to an expected mortality between 15% and 20%. Enrolment ended on the scheduled date and included 109 patients. Most cases (54%) were performed at 3 centres, where more than 10 THP each were implanted (10-26). The observed mortality in the large-volume centres (22%) was comparable to that observed in the low-volume centres (20%). The individually risk-adjusted cumulative sum revealed that observed in-hospital mortality was statistically in line with that predicted by the log EuroSCORE. Analysis of the secondary end point revealed 8% cases of paraplegia, all of which appeared after treatment of the thoracic type A aortic dissection. In France, THP for emergency frozen elephant trunk surgery outside high-volume centres did not result in excessive in-hospital deaths. However, a word of caution must be expressed regarding the prevention of medullar ischaemia even in emergency aortic surgery."

    "abstract": "Traumatic aortic dissection is most commonly caused following sudden deceleration injury. It most commonly involves descending thoracic aorta (DTA) and is associated with high mortality and morbidity if not treated urgently. Confirmation of diagnosis often requires contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is time consuming, expensive, and often not available at many health-care facility. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is equally efficient to CECT and MRI in diagnosing aortic dissection. It may also provide additional information that can be very useful for the management of the patient. In some cases, the likelihood of error in the diagnosis of such a critical condition with normal cardiovascular variations is expected. Herein, we describe a case with primary diagnosis of aortic dissection that led to final diagnosis of an aortic shelf that medically managed with a good long-term prognosis. In patients suspected to aortic dissection due to any cause, the specialized evaluation using the most accurate and sensitive tools is strongly recommended to discriminate normal vascular variations from major vascular defects requiring emergent surgical interventions."

While waiting for discharge, she started having mild chest discomfort. Unexpectedly, the third echocardiogram showed mild pericardial effusion, and a CT with contrast showed aortic dissection in the ascending aorta and infra-left subclavian aortic dissection. She was immediately transferred by a helicopter to a tertiary trauma center for emergent repair surgery. Considering the site of dissections, progression of existing intrinsic intimal tear triggered by energy impact was suspected. However, traumatic causes could not be excluded. Extra caution and diligence should be exercised when examining elderly patients in blunt trauma."

We present a case of a late complication of the modified Cabrol procedure that included replacing the ascending aorta with a composite graft. In February 2019, a 42-year-old female patient with Marfan syndrome who presented with chest pain was sent to the Emergency Department. She had undergone the modified Cabrol procedure 10 years prior. Upon presenting, laboratory analysis revealed elevated troponin-I levels. Electrocardiogram showed new inverted T waves over lead I, aVL and V4 to V6. Contrast computed tomography (CT) revealed thrombosis in the Dacron graft. Percutaneous coronary angiography was conducted, and a large thrombus in the graft was noted. Thrombolytic therapy and percutaneous coronary intervention were performed, after which the patient had no more symptoms and was discharged without complications. Aortic root surgery, including the Cabrol or modified Cabrol procedure, is necessary for complicated cases of aortic dilations, such as in patients with Marfan syndrome, even though the Cabrol or modified Cabrol procedure has a high complication rate. Regarding this case, we were surprised by the timing of the myocardial ischemia and the position of the thrombus, which differed from other cases. To better manage such a patient's condition and to detect the formation of thrombus early, completeness of the graft and possible stenosis of the anastomosis site to avoid preventable myocardial ischemia, we suggest that patients should have regular image follow-up, even years after the Cabrol or modified Cabrol procedure."

    "abstract": "The number of adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) already exceeds the number of children with congenital heart disease in the industrialized world. ACHD patients often show complex pathophysiology and anatomy even after reparative cardiac surgery. In case of complications patients may rapidly deteriorate and become unstable, even when they were asymptomatic or had only mild symptoms before the onset of the complication. Compared to all patients seen by emergency physicians, emergencies in ACHD patients are still rare. This review is aimed to guide management in ACHD emergency situations. Approximately two-thirds of all emergency admissions are caused by arrhythmias or acute heart failure. Sustained arrhythmias may rapidly lead to acute cardiac decompensation in ACHD patients. If medical treatment fails or patients present in hemodynamically unstable conditions, prompt electrical cardioversion is mandatory. Symptomatic bradycardia may require urgent pacemaker implantation. Depending on the underlying heart defect, placement of temporary transvenous pacemaker leads may be impossible. Acute heart failure in ACHD patients is often caused by acute right heart failure. Other more frequent emergencies are infections, syncope, thromboembolic events, and aortic dissection. It is highly recommended to contact the tertiary care center that follows the patient regularly early in case of patient presentation to the emergency room. Die Patientengruppe der Erwachsenen mit angeborenen Herzfehlern (EMAH) ist mittlerweile bereits größer als die der Kinder mit angeborenen Herzfehlern. EMAH-Patienten weisen auch nach Reparaturoperationen oft komplexe pathophysiologische und anatomische Verhältnisse auf. Bei Komplikationen kann es sehr rasch zu Notfallsituationen auch bei ansonsten asymptomatischen oder nur wenig symptomatischen Patienten kommen. Gemessen an der Gesamtzahl der Patienten, die von Notärzten und in den Notaufnahmen versorgt werden, sind EMAH-Notfallsituationen nach wie vor sehr selten. Diese Übersicht soll die Notfallbetreuung von EMAH-Patienten erleichtern. Für ca. zwei Drittel aller Notfälle sind Rhythmusstörungen und akute Herzinsuffizienz verantwortlich. Rhythmusstörungen müssen in der Regel zügig terminiert werden, weil sie unbehandelt rasch zur kardialen Dekompensation führen können. Bei Scheitern der medikamentösen Therapie oder hämodynamischer Instabilität müssen EMAH-Patienten mit tachykarden Rhythmusstörungen rasch elektrisch kardiovertiert werden. Symptomatische Bradykardien können eine rasche Schrittmacherversorgung erforderlich machen. Aufgrund der komplexen Anatomie kann das Einschwemmen eines transvenösen Interim-Schrittmachers bei einzelnen Vitien unmöglich sein. Die akute kardiale Dekompensation bei EMAH ist oft durch ein akutes Rechtsherzversagen verursacht. Weitere relativ häufige Aufnahmegründe sind Infektionen, Synkopen, Thromboembolien und Aortendissektion. Der Herzpass der Patienten informiert über das vorliegende Vitium. Die umgehende Kontaktaufnahme mit dem behandelnden EMAH-Zentrum wird dringend empfohlen."

Although the peripheral-reperfusion-first strategy has shown good results, more discussion regarding indicated patients is needed. This study aimed to describe the imaging features and surgical outcomes of mesenteric malperfusion and to clarify which cases should be considered for the peripheral-reperfusion-first strategy. A total of 200 patients underwent emergent aortic repair for acute type A aortic dissection at our institution between October 2011 and July 2019. Superior mesenteric artery occlusion on preoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography was detected in 12 patients, who were categorized into two groups based on enhancement (n = 7) or non-enhancement (n = 5) of the superior mesenteric artery peripheral branches. Operative outcomes after central repair were compared between groups. Four patients in the enhanced group had no postoperative abdominal complications, and three patients required superior mesenteric artery bypass grafting with the central-repair-first strategy. However, all patients in the enhanced group survived and did not require intestinal resection. In contrast, four patients (80%) in the non-enhanced group had intestinal necrosis, three patients required intestinal resection, and one patient died from multiple organ failure. The presence or absence of an enhancement of the peripheral superior mesenteric artery by the collateral network could be helpful for decision-making. The central-repair-first strategy may be permitted in patients with enhanced peripheral branches. Conversely, in patients with non-enhanced peripheral branches, a more invasive assessment should be considered before central aortic repair, and peripheral-reperfusion-first strategy may be required."

    "abstract": "Acute Stanford type A aortic dissection is often fatal, with a high mortality rate and requiring emergency intervention. Salvage surgery aims to keep the patient alive by addressing severe aortic regurgitation, tamponade, primary tear, and organ malperfusion and, if possible, prevent the late dissection-related complications in the proximal and downstream aorta. Unfortunately, no optimal standard treatment or technique to treat this disease exists. Total arch replacement with frozen elephant trunk technique plays an important role in treating acute type A aortic dissection. We aim to describe a modified elephant trunk technique and report its short-term outcomes. From February 2018 to August 2019, 16 patients diagnosed with acute Stanford type A aortic dissection underwent surgery with the modified frozen elephant trunk technique at Xiamen Heart Center (male/female: 9/7; average age: 56.1 ± 7.6 years). All perioperative variables were recorded and analyzed. We measured the diameters of the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta on the bifurcation of the pulmonary and abdominal aortas and compared the diameters at admission, before discharge, and 3 months after discharge. Fifteen patients (93.8%) had hypertension. The primary tears were located in the lesser curvature of the aortic arch and ascending aorta in 5 (31.3%) and 9 patients (56.3%), respectively, and no entry was found in 2 patients (12.5%). The dissection extended to the iliac artery and distal descending aorta in 14 (87.6%) and 2 patients (12.5%), respectively. The duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), cross-clamping, and antegrade cerebral perfusion were 215.8 ± 40.5, 140.8 ± 32.3, and 55.1 ± 15.2 min, respectively. Aortic valve repair was performed in 15 patients (93.8%). Bentall procedure was performed in one patient (6.3%). Another patient received coronary artery repair (6.3%). The diameters at all levels were greater on discharge than those on admission, except the aortic arch. After 3 months, the true lumen diameter distal to the frozen elephant trunk increased, indicating false lumen thrombosis and/or aortic remodeling. The modified frozen elephant trunk technique for acute Stanford type A aortic dissection is safe and feasible and could be used for organ malperfusion. Short-term outcomes are encouraging, but long-term outcomes require further investigation."

    "abstract": "Type A acute aortic dissection (TA-AAD) is a catastrophic condition for which emergency surgery is the mainstay of therapy. Surgical treatment of TA-AAD is centered on excision of the proximal intimal tear, replacement of the ascending aorta and re-establishment of a dominant flow in the distal true lumen. In patients who survive surgery, a dissected distal and/or proximal aorta remains, posing a risk of subsequent aneurysmal degeneration, rupture and malperfusion, and secondary extensive interventions are often required. However, knowledge regarding the risk factors of progression of residual aortic dissection is limited, and no well-defined recommendations for clinical and imaging follow-up have been generated thus far. The aim of this paper is to review and discuss on the current evidence and controversies on the long-term management of patients operated on for TA-AAD."

The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) as a novel inflammatory marker for ATAAD patients undergoing surgical repair. We retrospectively examined the medical records of 151 ATAAD patients who treated surgically. Patients were divided into two groups (survival and death) and these groups were compared with respect to clinical and laboratory parameters. The PNI was calculated as 10 × serum albumin (g/dL) + 0.005 × total lymphocyte count (per mm3). Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors of in-hospital mortality. The mean age of the study cohort was 61 ± 12 years, 99 (65.6%) were males, and 35 (23.2%) patients died during the hospital stay. The PNI levels were significantly lower in death group compared with survival group (32.80 ± 4.90 vs. 37.94 ± 5.42, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that the PNI (OR: 0.795, p = 0.005), age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.085, p = 0.034), operating time (OR: 1.660, p = 0.042), and D-dimer (OR: 1.002, p = 0.001) independently predicted in-hospital mortality. The calculated cutoff value of the PNI was 33.01. Lower PNI values are independently associated with in-hospital mortality in ATAAD. The PNI may be a useful tool for predicting the early mortality of ATAAD patients after surgical repair."

    "abstract": "Out-of-hours work is believed to lead to a higher complication rate and mortality after surgery. However, there is no data supporting this perception in type A acute aortic dissections (TAAD) repair. We present an observational study of prospectively collected data comparing operative outcomes and late survival of TAAD repair performed after hours versus regular daytime working hours. A total of 196 patients undergoing emergency TAAD repair (mean age 59 ± 13 years, range 18-81, F/M 57/139) were included in the final analysis. Patients were stratified as daytime between 7 AM and 7 PM (n = 124), and night time between 7 PM and 7 AM (n = 72). Inverse propensity score (PS) weighting for modelling causal effects was used to assess the effect of time procedure on outcomes of interest. Overall 30-day mortality was 14.3% (28 patients). No significant differences were found between the night-time and day-time groups with regard to operative mortality (8.3% versus 17.3%; adjusted OR 0.35; 95%CI 0.12-1.04; P = 0.06), re-exploration (12.5% versus 9.7%; adjusted OR 2.09; 95%CI 0.72-6.07; P = 0.18) and neurological deficit (18.1% versus 16.9%; adjusted OR 0.91; 95%CI 0.33-2.54; P = 0.87). Long-term survival at mean 9 years follow-up was comparable between the two groups (adjusted log-rank P = 0.28). Night-time surgical repair of TAAD when compared with day-time repair does not seem to be associated with a greater risk of surgical complications, operative mortality and long-term mortality."

This retrospective study enrolled 121 consecutive patients less than 40 years old who received TA-AAD emergency surgeries between January 2014 to December 2018 in Nanjing Drum Tower hospital. The diagnosis of AKI was made based on the KDIGO criteria. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for postoperative AKI. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to compare long-term outcomes between patients with and without AKI complication after TA-AAD surgeries. Among all enrolled patients, AKI occurred in 51 patients (42.1%) and renal replacement therapy (RRT) was required in 15 patients (12.4%). The development of postoperative AKI was associated with increased 30-day mortality (P = 0.041), longer ICU stay time (P < 0.001) and hospital stay time (P = 0.006). Multivariable analysis indicated that elevated preoperative serum cystatin C (sCyC) (OR = 6.506, 95% CI: 1.852-22.855, P = 0.003) was the only independent risk factor for developing AKI. The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of preoperative sCyC was 0.800 (95% CI: 0.719, 0.882). Preoperative sCyC had a sensitivity of 64.7% and a specificity of 83.8% in diagnosing postoperative AKI with a cut-off value of 0.895 mg/L. In addition, our data suggested there was no difference discovered regarding long-term cumulative survival rate between patients with and without AKI during a median 29 months follow-up period. Postoperative AKI after TA-AAD surgeries was relatively common in young patients and associated with increased short-term mortality. Elevated preoperative sCyC was identified as an independent risk factor for AKI with potential diagnostic merit."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is an emergent medical condition, generally affecting the elderly, characterized by a separation of the aortic wall layers and subsequent creation of a pseudolumen that may compress the true aortic lumen. Predisposing factors mediate their risk by either increasing tension on the wall or by causing structural degeneration. They include hypertension, atherosclerosis, and a number of connective tissue diseases. If it goes undetected, aortic dissection carries a significant mortality risk; therefore, a high degree of clinical suspicion and a prompt diagnosis are required to maximize survival chances. Imaging methods, most commonly a CT scan, are essential for diagnosis; however, several studies have also investigated the effect of several biomarkers to aid in the detection of the condition. The choice of intervention varies depending on the type of dissection, with open surgical repair remaining of choice in those with type. In dissections, however, the role of conventional open surgery has considerably diminished in complicated type B dissections, with endovascular repair, a much less invasive technique, proving to be more effective. In uncomplicated type B dissections, where medical choice reigned supreme as the optimal intervention, endovascular repair is being explored as a viable option which may reduce long- term mortality outcomes, although the ideal intervention in this situation is far from settled."

    "abstract": "Direct true lumen cannulation (DTLC) of the aorta is an alternative cardiopulmonary bypass cannulation technique in the context of type A acute aortic dissection (A-AAD). DTLC has been reported to be effective in restoring adequate perfusion to jeopardized organs. This study reports and compares operative outcomes with DTLC or alternative cannulation techniques in a large cohort of patients with A-AAD. All patients who underwent surgery for A-AAD between January 2006 and January 2017 in Mainz university hospital were reviewed. The choice of cannulation technique was left to the operating surgeon, however DTLC was our preference in patients who were in state of shock or showed signs of tamponade or hypoperfusion, in cases of potential cerebral malperfusion, as well as in patients who were under resuscitation. A total of 528 patients (63% males, mean age 64±13.8 years) underwent emergency surgery for A-AAD. The DTLC technique was used in 52.4% of patients. The DTLC group of patients had worse clinical status at the time of presentation with more shock, tamponade, true lumen collapse, cerebral and other malperfusion states. New neurologic events were diagnosed in around 8% of patients in each group following surgery, but there was a trend for quicker neurological recovery in the DTLC-group. Early mortality rates, short-term and long-term survival rates did not differ between the two groups. DTLC is a safe cannulation technique that enables effective antegrade true lumen perfusion in complicated A-AAD scenarios, and is an advantageous addition to the aortic surgeons' armamentarium."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AD) is a life-threatening emergency. The most common symptom of AD is chest pain, more frequently associated with Type-A AD per the Stanford classification, while Type-B AD is associated with back and abdominal pain. Conversely, monoplegia is an uncommon symptom of AD. We encountered a case of transient monoplegia caused by Stanford type-B AD. A 75-year-old man presented with acute-onset lumbar back pain with monoplegia. Lumbar radiography revealed multiple compression fractures and spinal-canal stenosis, and accordingly acute spinal-cord compression was suspected. Monoplegia subsided after a diclofenac suppository was administrated to reduce his pain. However, the patient's right lower-extremity pain and paralysis worsened at rest during the stay. Computer tomography angiography revealed Stanford type-B AD and the false lumen obstructing the right common iliac artery. Monoplegia in type-B AD can develop due to spinal-cord or lumbosacral-plexus ischemia. Malperfusion, determined by the balance of the pressure in the false and true lumens and subsequent end-organ ischemia, may produce transient or persistent symptom patterns. Emergency physicians need to suspect AD when a patient presents with monoplegia or transient symptom patterns of unknown etiology."

We report a case of a 62-year-old man admitted to our hospital with chest pain, who was diagnosed as inferior wall myocardial infarction based on electrocardiographic findings. The diagnosis was reassessed due to a significant aortic regurgitation and an intimal tear in the ascending aorta on transthoracic echocardiography.

    "abstract": "Current guidelines recommend prophylactic replacement of the ascending aorta at an aneurysmal diameter of >55 mm to prevent acute Type A aortic dissection (TAAD) in non-Marfan patients. Several publications have challenged this threshold, suggesting that surgery should be performed in smaller aneurysms to prevent this devastating disease. We reviewed our experience with measuring aortic size at the time of TAAD to validate the existing recommendation for prophylactic ascending aorta replacement. All patients who had been admitted for TAAD to our emergency department from 2014 to 2019 and underwent ascending aorta replacement were included. Marfan patients were excluded. The maximum diameter of the dissected aorta was measured preoperatively using CT scan. We estimated the aortic diameter at the time of dissection to be 7 mm smaller than the measured maximum diameter of the dissected aorta (modelled pre-dissection diameter). Overall, 102 patients were included. Of these, 67 were male (65.6%) and 35 were female (34.4%), and the cohort's mean age was 65 ± 12.1 years. In addition, 66% were treated for arterial hypertension. The mean maximum modelled pre-dissection diameter was 39.6 ± 4.8 mm: 39.1 ± 5.1 mm in men and 40.7 ± 2.8 mm in women (P = 0.1). The cumulative 30-day mortality rate was 19.6% (20/102). TAAD occurred at a modelled aortic diameter below 45 mm in 87.7% of our patients. Therefore, the current aortic diameter threshold of 55 mm excludes ∼99% of patients with TAAD from prophylactic replacement of the ascending aorta. The maximum diameter of the ascending aorta warrants reappraisal and this parameter should be a distinct part of a personalized decision-making process that also takes into account age, gender and body surface area to establish the surgical indication for preventive aorta replacement aimed to improve the survival benefit of this procedure."

Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the time point of skin incision (05:00 a.m. to 07:00 p.m. = daytime group; 07:01 p.m. to 04:59 a.m. = night-time group). We also noted whether their surgeries were started on weekdays (Monday 00:00 to Friday 23:59) or weekends (Saturday 00:00 to Sunday 23:59). The median age was 61 years (interquartile range 49-70) and 69.6% (n = 222) were male. Almost 50% (n = 149) of patients presented in a critical preoperative state. Forty-one percent of patients (n = 131) underwent night-time surgery. There were no differences in baseline data, time from onset of symptoms to surgery or surgical treatment between groups, except from preferred femoral access for arterial cannulation during night-time.

We searched the Pubmed and EMBASE databases for articles related to VSRR and composite valve conduit (CVC) root replacement, and the long-term results of these techniques in TAAAD. Supracomissural repair is limited by reintervention, and CVC results are affected by complications related to the prosthetic valve.

By screening a patient information system for International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) diagnosis codes covering more than 85% of acute hospital admissions in the state of Styria (~1.24 million inhabitants), we retrospectively identified patients with admission diagnoses for MI (I21, I22), PE (I26), and AAD (I71). Rates of complications such as cardiogenic shock and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, treatment escalations (thrombolysis for PE), and mortality were analyzed by patient chart review during 6 weeks following onset of COVID-19 associated RM, and during respective time frames in the years 2016 to 2019. 1,668 patients were included. Cumulative admissions for MI, PE and AAD decreased (RR 0.77; p<0.001) during RM compared to previous years. In contrast, intrahospital mortality increased by 65% (RR 1.65; p = 0.041), mainly driven by mortality following MI (RR 1.80; p = 0.042). PE patients received more frequently thrombolysis treatment (RR 3.63; p = 0.006), while rates of cardiogenic shock and cardiopulmonary resuscitation remained unchanged. Of 226 patients hospitalized during RM, 81 patients with suspected COVID-19 disease were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection with only 5 testing positive. Thus, cumulative hospital admissions for cardiovascular emergencies decreased during COVID-19 associated RM while intrahospital mortality increased."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic syndrome (AAS) is an emergency and life-threatening condition including aortic dissection, intramural hematoma, penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer and iatrogenic-traumatic aortic injury. An integrated multiparametric approach (clinical history and examination, electrocardiogram, biomarkers and imaging techniques) is recommended in order to make timely and accurate diagnosis, delineate the prognosis, choose the most appropriate therapeutic interventions tailored for the individual patient. Nowadays the best imaging strategy for diagnosing AAS and its complications is a combination of transthoracic echocardiography and computed tomography angiography (CTA). Transesophageal echocardiography tends to be carried out in complicated cases prior to surgical or endovascular therapy, often in the operating room and under general anesthesia. In this regard, intravascular ultrasound and intraluminal phase array imaging may be implemented during the endovascular procedures depending on operator expertise and cost issues. On the other hand, owing to its intrinsic characteristics, magnetic resonance imaging is an ideal imaging technique for serial measurements in patients at risk of AAS or with chronic dissection. Among biomarkers, D-dimer is the closest to \"golden status\" (high sensitivity and low negative likelihood ratio). Interestingly, 18fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT is increasingly being used along with specific serologic biomarkers (white blood cells, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen and D-dimer) to detect and monitor vascular inflammation affecting the aorta and systemic arteries. It is expected, in the near future, the development of serologic and imaging biomarkers able to early detect clinically-silent pathologic changes in the aorta wall before (primary prevention) and after (secondary prevention) the acute index event."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection with arch involvement is a life-threatening condition, which requires immediate surgical attention. Emergent total arch replacement and root reconstruction is a technically demanding operation with varying outcomes based on surgeon experience. The human factors in total arch replacement in the emergent setting have never been systematically investigated. The ability of surgeons with low volumes to achieve acceptable results in their start-up period is not known. From January 2013 to December 2016, patients with acute type A aortic dissection who underwent emergent total arch replacement with three surgeons were enrolled. Basic characteristics, procedural and postoperative outcomes were collected. The time of critical surgical steps and operative mortality were calculated using descriptive statistics and cumulative SUM (CUSUM) analysis. A total of 300 patients (age 53.8±11.5 years, female 63, 21.0%) with acute type A aortic dissection underwent emergent total arch replacement. A total of 219 patients (73.0%) had root reinforcement, 295 patients (98.3%) underwent frozen elephant trunk repair. Mean circulatory arrest and cross-clamp times were 29.8±9.8 and 112.3±32.1 min, respectively. The operative mortality was 6.7%, the stroke rate was 4.0%. The mean length of postoperative ICU and hospital stays were 8.4±10.6 and 18.0±12.2 days, respectively. By CUSUM depictions, surgeons appeared to have different learning curves with regards to operative time. By CUSUM failure analysis on operative mortality, two newly appointed surgeons in their start-up period stayed in an acceptable range, while one senior surgeon with higher volumes experienced superior outcomes and better performance. Although emergent total arch replacement for acute type A dissection is a complex scenario, surgeons well-trained in adult cardiac surgery are able to achieve acceptable results in their start-up period."

    "abstract": "Data on the clinical features and surgical outcomes of type A intramural hematoma (IMH) in Chinese patients are very limited. We aimed to present the surgical experiences on type A IMH in our center, and report early and late outcomes. From February 2012 to April 2018, 106 consecutive patients underwent open surgery for type A IMH at our hospital. We adopted emergent operation for patients with cardiac tamponade or other severe complications, and recommended initial medical treatment followed by elective surgery for stable patients. The composite endpoints included operative mortality, permanent nerve damage (stroke, paraplegia), and new-onset renal failure necessitating hemodialysis. Risk factors for operative mortality and the composite endpoints were identified using univariable and multivariable logistic regression model analysis. The survival and freedom from aortic events were analyzed using a Kaplan-Meier surviving curve and a log-rank test. Except 1 patient receiving emergent surgery (within 24 hours from onset) because of cardiac tamponade and cerebral malperfusion, all patients received initial medical treatment and delayed surgery. Two patient developed pericardial tamponade while waiting for surgery, and then received emergent surgery. Preoperative conversion to aortic dissection (AD) was noted in no patient. The operative techniques included ascending aorta replacement in 9 patients, hemiarch replacement in 18 patients, total arch replacement (TAR) with frozen elephant trunk (FET) in 45 patient and hybrid aortic arch repair in 34 patients. The mean cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time and cross-clamp time were 138.7±41.6 and 79.3±27.8 min, respectively. The operative mortality was 1.9% (2/106). And the composite endpoints occurred in 7 patients. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed CPB time ≥200 min and chronic kidney disease were risk factors for the composite endpoints. The follow-up data were available in 97 survivors, with the mean follow-up time of 30.8±16.2 months. Three patients died and 5 patients developed aortic events during the follow-up. The overall survival at 1-, 3- and 5-year were 97.0%, 95.3%, and 79.4%, respectively. And freedom from aortic events at 1-, 3- and 5-year were 97.7%, 95.3% and 89.4%, respectively. Our strategy had got low mortality and excellent mid-term survival in patients with type A IMH. Therefore, our strategy was suitable for the surgical repair of type A IMH in Chinese population."

    "title": "[The hypertensive emergency situation : Recommendations for initial drug therapy management].",
    "abstract": "The hypertensive emergency situation is characterized by an acute-mostly life-threatening-blood pressure derailment with the risk of acute end organ damage. It is an acute manifestation of arterial hypertension, which manifests in a variety of symptoms. The etiology is in most cases long-term (chronic) hypertension as a result of low compliance or inadequate antihypertensive therapy. It can also occur as a first manifestation of arterial hypertension. It requires timely antihypertensive drug therapy, which should be initiated in an intensive or intermediate care unit. The choice of antihypertensive therapy regimen should be based on the underlying end organ damage. Fast-acting, easily controllable and intravenously administered substances should be preferred. The most commonly used substances (groups) are urapidil, nitroglycerin, beta blockers and short-acting calcium channel blockers. With a few exceptions, a deliberate, rapid reduction in blood pressure of no more than 20-25% of the initial value is sufficient for extracerebral causes. A subsequent systolic blood pressure target of 160/100 mm Hg should be aimed for within the next 2-6 h. An overly rapid drop in blood pressure can lead to reduced blood flow to the central nervous system due to changes in autoregulation. Exceptions to this rule are acute aortic dissection and flash pulmonary edema-in these cases, prompt blood pressure normalization should be achieved. The initial acute therapy should be followed by a more detailed investigation of the cause and a long-term therapy setting based on this. Der hypertensive Notfall ist gekennzeichnet durch eine akute – zumeist lebensbedrohliche – Blutdruckentgleisung mit der Gefahr einer akuten Endorganschädigung. Er stellt eine Akutmanifestation der arteriellen Hypertonie dar, die sich durch eine breite Symptomvielfalt äußern kann. Entstehungsgrundlage ist in den meisten Fällen eine chronische Hochdruckkrankheit infolge von unzureichender Compliance oder einer unzureichenden medikamentösen Therapie. Zudem kann er Ausdruck einer Erstmanifestation einer arteriellen Hypertonie sein. Dies bedarf einer zeitnahen antihypertensiven, medikamentösen Therapie, die primär auf einer Intensiv- oder Überwachungsstation stattfinden sollte. Die Auswahl des medikamentösen Therapieregimes sollte sich dabei an der zugrunde liegenden Endorganschädigung orientieren. In der Regel sollten schnell wirksame, gut steuerbare und intravenös zu verabreichenden Substanzen bevorzugt werden. Die am häufigsten eingesetzten Substanzen (Substanzgruppen) sind Urapidil, Nitroglyzerin, β‑Blocker und kurzwirksame Kalziumantagonisten. Bis auf wenige Ausnahmen ist bei extrazerebralen Ursachen eine bedachte, rasche Senkung des Blutdrucks von nicht mehr als 20–25 % des Ausgangswerts zielführend. Anschließend sollte innerhalb der nächsten 2–6 h ein Zielwert eines systolischen Blutdrucks von 160/100 mm Hg angestrebt werden. Eine zu rasche Blutdrucksenkung kann durch eine veränderte Autoregulation zu einer Minderdurchblutung insbesondere des Gehirns führen. Ausnahmen von dieser Regelung bilden die akute Aortendissektion und das kardiale Lungenödem – in diesen Fällen sollte eine zeitnahe Blutdrucknormalisierung erzielt werden. An die initiale Akuttherapie sollte sich eine weitergehende Ursachenabklärung und eine sich daran orientierende Langzeittherapieeinstellung anschließen."

From January 23 to April 30, 2020, we performed ATAAD repair for 33 patients, including three with pregnancy-related TAADs. Confirmation of COVID-19 depended on the results of two nucleic acid tests and pulmonary computed tomography scan. Based on testing results and hemodynamic stability, patients were triaged to an isolated intensive care unit or negative pressure operating room for emergency surgery. Mean age 50.2 ± 13.3 years and 20 were male (60.1%) and 8 patients were febrile (>37.3°C; 24.2%) and 17 were lymphopenic (51.5%). No patient was excluded from COVID-19 infection preoperatively. Extensive aortic repair with total arch replacement (TAR) was performed in 24 (72.7%), and limited proximal repair in 9 patients (27.3%). Cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp times averaged 177 ± 34 and 88 ± 20 min for TAR, and 150 ± 30 and 83 ± 18 min for hemiarch, respectively. The mean operation time was 410 ± 68.3 min. Operative mortality was 6.1% (2/33). Complications included reintubation in four (12.1%), acute kidney failure in two (6.1%), and cerebral infarction in one (3.0%). No paraplegia nor re-exploration for bleeding occurred. COVID-19 was excluded in 100% eventually. No nosocomial infection occurred. Nor did any patient/surgical staff develop fever or test positive during the study period. The results of this study show that our management protocol based on testing results and hemodynamic stability in patients with ATAAD during the COVID-19 pandemic was effective and achieved favorable early surgical outcomes."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD), is a surgical emergency often requiring intervention on the aortic root. There is much controversy regarding root management; aggressively pursuing a root replacement, versus more conservative approaches to preserve native structures. Electronic database search we performed through PubMed, Embase, SCOPUS, google scholar, and Cochrane identifying studies that reported on outcomes of surgical repair of ATAAD through either root preservation or replacement. The identified articles focused on short- and long-term mortalities, and rates of reoperation on the aortic root. There remains controversy on replacing or preserving aortic root in ATAAD. Current evidence supports practice of both trends following an extensive decision-making framework, with conflicting series suggesting favorable results with both procedures as the approach that best defines higher survival rates and lower perioperative complications. Yet, the decision to perform either approach remains surgeon decision and bound to the extent of the dissection and tear entries in strong correlation with status of the aortic valve and involvement of coronaries in the dissection. There exists much controversy regarding fate of the aortic root in ATAAD. There are conflicting studies for impact of root replacement on mortality, whilst some study's report no significant results at all. There is strong evidence regarding risk of reoperation being greater when root is not replaced. Majority of these studies are limited by the single centered, retrospective nature of these small sample sized cohorts, further hindered by potential of treatment bias."

    "abstract": "Type A acute aortic dissection (TAAAD) represents a surgical emergency requiring intervention regardless of time of day. Whether such a \"evening effect\" exists regarding outcomes for TAAAD has not been previously studied using a large registry data. Patients with TAAAD were identified from the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissections (1996-2019). Outcomes were compared between patients undergoing operative repair during the daytime (D), defined as 8 am-5 pm, versus the evening (N), defined as 5 pm-8 am. Four thousand one-hundrd and ninety-seven surgically treated patients with TAAAD were identified, with 1824 patients undergoing daytime surgery (43.5%) and 2373 patients undergoing evening surgery (56.5%). Daytime patients were more likely to have undergone prior cardiac surgery (13.2% vs. 9.5%; p < .001) and have had a prior aortic dissection (4.8% vs. 3.4%; p = .04). Evening patients were more likely to have been transferred from a referring hospital (70.8% vs. 75.0%; p = .003). Daytime patients were more likely to undergo aortic valve sparing root procedures (23.3% vs. 19.2%; p = .035); however, total arch replacement was performed with equal frequency (19.4% vs. 18.8%; p = .751). In-hospital mortality (D: 17.3% vs. N. 16.2%; p = .325) was similar between both groups. Subgroup analysis examining the effect of weekend presentation revealed no significant mortality difference. A majority of TAAAD patients underwent surgical repair at night. There were higher rates of postoperative tamponade in evening patients; however, mortality was similar. The expertise of cardiac-dedicated operative and critical care teams regardless of time of day as well as training paradigms may explain similar mortality outcomes in this high risk population."

    "abstract": "Retrograde type A dissection (RTAD) after zone 0 hybrid aortic arch repair is highly lethal and not infrequent complication. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of rapid cardiac pacing as an adjunctive tool to prevent RTAD during or after hybrid procedures for zone 0 disease. We performed a retrospective review of 42 consecutive patients with zone 0 hybrid aortic arch repair between November 2004 and January 2018. Right ventricular pacing was carried out through unipolar electrodes attached to the epicardium of the right ventricle through the sternotomy (the indifferent electrode was in the subcutaneous tissue). Pacing was utilised during the clamping of the ascending aorta, release of the aortic clamp, and stent-graft deployment. Operative indications were aortic arch aneurysm 45% (n = 19), aortic arch dissection 45% (n = 19), traumatic rupture of isthmus 7% (n = 3), and type IA endoleak 2% (n = 1). Urgent procedures 48% (n = 20). The mean proximal aortic diameter was 34.14 ± 2.9 mm. Mean stent-graft oversizing was 12.97 ± 3.4%. The 30-day mortality rate was 14% (n = 6). RTAD was observed in 7% (n = 3). The actuarial survival rate was 74% over a mean follow-up of 50 ± 30.2 months. Since January 2013, rapid right ventricular pacing (overdrive pacing at a rate of 200 beats/min) was systematically used (n = 24). No RTAD was observed in this group of patients. Rapid right ventricular pacing reduced significatively the risk of RTAD (P = 0.038). Rapid right ventricular pacing is an effective method of inducing hypotension and appears to decrease the risk of retrograde type A dissection after zone 0 hybrid aortic arch repair."

    "abstract": "This case report presents a case of a patient with global cerebral infarction of uncertain etiology following an emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection. As a result, factor XII deficiency was revealed postoperatively. To date, there have been several reports of cardiovascular surgery in patients with factor XII deficiency. However, all previous reports were of patients whose factor XII deficiency had been detected preoperatively; therefore, before this, there had been no reports of complications associated with factor XII deficiency following cardiovascular surgery. We report a case of emergency aortic arch replacement surgery for acute type A aortic dissection in a 57-year-old Japanese man. A blood test prior to the surgery showed coagulopathy, a platelet count of 117 × 109/L, a prothrombin time-international normalized ratio of 1.78, an activated partial thromboplastin time of 69.7 seconds, and fibrinogen < 50 mg/dl. A smaller-than-usual dose of heparin (8000 IU) was administered because the patient's activated clotting time was extremely prolonged (> 999 seconds). After the heparin administration, the activated clotting time, measured every 30-60 minutes, remained unchanged (> 999 seconds); therefore, additional heparin was not administered during the surgery, and there was no clinical problem during cardiopulmonary bypass. However, a diagnosis of global cerebral infarction was made on the first postoperative day. An additional blood coagulation test performed on postoperative day 9 revealed factor XII deficiency (8.0%). Regarding the reason that global cerebral infarction occurred in the present case, two reasons were considered: One was factor XII deficiency itself, and the other was low-dose heparin administration during the cardiopulmonary bypass due to excessively prolonged activated clotting time caused by factor XII deficiency. Factor XII deficiency should be considered in patients with prolonged activated clotting time and spontaneous thrombosis in vascular surgeries. Moreover, the present case emphasizes that management of heparin during cardiopulmonary bypass should not be performed on the basis of activated clotting time monitoring alone, especially in a case with prolonged activated clotting time."

Computed tomography revealed DeBakey type I dissection with massive hemopericardium and obstruction of both the celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery. After emergency pericardiotomy and removal of the hematoma, superior mesenteric artery-external iliac artery bypass was constructed with a vein graft, and this restored mesenteric perfusion. Open distal hemiarch replacement was then performed. The postoperative course was uneventful. Superior mesenteric artery revascularization achieved immediately after release of the cardiac tamponade prevented further mesenteric ischemia and paved the way for the aortic repair."

Without urgent and proper treatment, the mortality rate increases to 50% within 48 hours. Most patients present with acute onset of symptoms, including sudden severe pain and complex and variable clinical manifestations, which can be easily misdiagnosed. Despite this, the molecular mechanisms underlying AD are still unknown. Recently, non-coding RNAs have emerged as novel regulators of gene expression. Previous studies have proven that ncRNAs can regulate several cardiovascular diseases; therefore, their potential as clinical biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets for AD has aroused widespread interest. To date, several studies have reported that microRNAs are crucially involved in AD progression. Additionally, several long non-coding RNAs and circular RNAs have been found to be differentially expressed in AD samples, suggesting their potential roles in vascular physiology and disease. In this review, we discuss the functions of ncRNAs in AD pathophysiology and highlight their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD. Meanwhile, we present the animal models previously used for AD research, as well as the specific methods for constructing mouse or rat AD models."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of family history of AD on the incidence and prognosis of AD and estimate the heritability and environmental contribution in AD in Taiwan. Both cross-sectional and cohort studies were conducted using Taiwan National Health Insurance database. A registry parent-offspring relationship algorithm was used to reconstruct the genealogy of this population for heritability estimation. The cross-sectional study included 23,868 patients with a diagnosis of AD in 2015. The prevalence and adjusted relative risks (RRs) were evaluated, and the liability threshold model was used to examine the effects of heritability and environmental factors. Furthermore, a 1:10 propensity score-matched cohort comprising AD patients with or without a family history of AD was included to compare late outcomes in the cohort study. A family history of AD in first-degree relatives was associated with an RR of 6.82 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.12 to 9.07). The heritability of AD was estimated to be 57.0% for genetic factors, and 3.1% and 40.0% for shared and nonshared environmental factors, respectively. After excluding individuals with Marfan syndrome or bicuspid aortic valve, a family history of AD was associated with an RR of 6.56 (95% CI: 4.92 to 8.77) for AD. Furthermore, patients with AD and a family history of AD had a higher risk of later aortic surgery than those with AD without a family history (subdistribution hazard ratio: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.12 to 1.76). A family history of AD was a strong risk factor for AD. Furthermore, patients with AD with a family history of AD had a higher risk of later aortic surgery than those with no family history of AD."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a surgical emergency with an operative mortality of up to 30%, a rate that has not changed meaningfully in more than 2 decades. A growing body of research has highlighted several comorbidities and presenting factors in which delay or permanent deferral of surgery may be considered; however, modern comprehensive summative reviews are lacking. The urgency and timing of this review are underscored by significant challenges in resource use posed by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This review provides an update on the current understanding of risk assessment, surgical candidacy, and operative timing in patients with ATAAD. A literature search was conducted through PubMed and Embase databases to identify relevant studies relating to risk assessment in ATAAD. Articles were selected by group consensus on the basis of quality and relevance. Several patient factors have been identified that increase risk in ATAAD repair. In particular, frailty, advanced age, previous cardiac surgery, and use of novel anticoagulant medications have been studied. The understanding of malperfusion syndromes has also expanded significantly, including recommendations for surgical delay. Finally, approaches to triage have been significantly influenced by resource limitations related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Although medical management remains a reasonable option in carefully selected patients at prohibitive risk for open surgery, endovascular therapies for treatment of ATAAD are rapidly evolving. Early surgical repair remains the preferred treatment for most patients with ATAAD. However, improvements in risk stratification should guide appropriate delay or permanent deferral of surgery in select individuals."

    "abstract": "The fundamental treatment of Stanford type A acute aortic dissection is a lifesaving emergency surgery in our hospital. We perform hemiarch replacement with a focus on entry tear, but an extended surgery is also performed only when resection of the entry tear is difficult. The outcomes of current therapeutic policy, along with the short-term and the long-term outcomes of different sites of entry tear, were examined retrospectively. Three hundred and twenty surgery of Stanford type A acute aortic dissection were performed between 1991 and 2015 at our hospital. Their short-term and long-term outcomes were examined after dividing them into 7 groups according to their entry sites. We also investigated surgical methods and effects of presence/absence of residual entry tear. As a result, overall hospital mortality was 13.1%. There was no significant difference in either shortterm or long-term outcome among the groups. Likewise, no significant difference was observed in the surgical methods or the presence/absence of residual entry tear. Recently, minimally invasive procedures, such as stent-grafting, have been applied to manage the residual entry tear. Therefore, an aggressive extended surgery is no longer inevitable and our current therapeutic policy is considered reasonable."

    "abstract": "We experienced a surgical case of Stanford type A acute aortic dissection with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) associated with ectopic kidney. Computerized tomography did not detect any ulcer-like projections, but 3 days later, it appeared, and emergency surgery was performed. Second-stage surgery was selected and done later to repair AAA. The right kidney was an ectopic pelvic kidney. The renal arteries had branched off from the left common iliac artery, and the renal artery lumen narrowed. With a 4 Fr catheter, cold Ringer's solution was given to protect the kidneys during surgery. The patient showed no deterioration of kidney function and made good progress. After rehabilitation, the patient had no complications and was discharged from the hospital."

    "title": "An infection-oriented approach for thoracic endovascular aortic repair in a SARS-CoV-2 positive patient. A case report.",
    "abstract": "A 64-year-old woman presented to our emergency department during the outbreak of the covid-19 emergency in Italy with syncope, anosmia, mild dyspnoea and atypical chest and dorsal pain. A chest CT scan showed an acute type B aortic dissection (ATBAD) and bilateral lung involvement with ground-glass opacity, compatible with interstitial pneumonia. Nasopharyngeal swabs resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2. For the persistence of chest pain, despite the analgesic therapy, we decided to treat her with a TEVAR. Patient's chest and back pain resolved during the first few days after the procedure. No surgical or respiratory complications occurred and the patient was discharged 14 days after surgery. By performing the operation under local anesthesia, it was possible to limit both the staff inside the operatory room and droplet/aerosol release. Since we had to perform the operation in a hemodynamics room, thanks to the limited extension of the endoprosthesis and the good caliber of the right vertebral artery we were able to reduce the risk of spinal cord ischemia despite the lack of a revascularization of the left subclavian artery. A minimally invasive total endovascular approach allows, through local anesthesia and percutaneous access, to avoid surgical cut down and orotracheal intubation. This, combined with a defined management protocol for infected patients, seems to be a reasonable way to perform endovascular aortic procedures in urgent setting, even in a SARSCoV- 2 positive patient. COVID-19, Dissection, TEVAR. Nel marzo 2020 una donna di 64 anni si è presentata presso il nostro pronto soccorso con sincope, anosmia, lieve dispnea e dolore toracico. Riferiva inoltre febbricola nei giorni precedenti, ma al momento del ricovero era apiretica e la sua saturazione di ossigeno in aria ambiente era 93%. Una TC del torace (eseguita per escludere una tromboembolia polmonare) ha evidenziato una dissezione aortica acuta di tipo B e una polmonite interstiziale bilaterale, con successiva positività del tampone naso-faringeo per SARS-CoV-2. La dissezione aortica era estesa longitudinalmente per circa 6 cm, con un tear di entrata situato subito distalmente rispetto all’origine dell’arteria succlavia sinistra. Come per tutte le sindromi aortiche acute, la paziente è stata trasferita in terapia intensiva per monitoraggio invasivo della pressione arteriosa; in questo caso è stata pianificata una stanza singola con isolamento da contatto e per droplets. Secondo il protocollo interno è stata impostata una terapia antivirale ed una profilassi antibiotica ed antitrombotica. La somministrazione di ossigeno a basso flusso attraverso occhialini nasali era sufficiente per mantenere una saturazione > 94%. Una scansione TC dopo 24 ore non ha mostrato cambiamenti nell’estensione della dissezione, ma la paziente continuava a riferire dolore toracico nonostante la terapia analgesica per cui è stato deciso di sottoporla a trattamento chirurgico. In anestesia locale (senza intubazione oro-tracheale e con un anestesista in stand-by fuori dalla stanza) ed utilizzando una sala di emodinamica (per la indisponibilità delle sale operatorie, trasformate in terapia intensiva per i pazienti COVID-19) la lesione è stata esclusa mediante il posizionamento di una endoprotesi toracica con copertura intenzionale dell’origine della succlavia di sinistra senza rivascolarizzazione. L’angiografia finale ha mostrato la completa esclusione della dissezione e l’assenza di endoleak. In base al nostro protocollo infettivologico, per l’intera durata della procedura alla paziente è stata applicata una mascherina chirurgica al fine di limitare la diffusione di droplets e l’ossigenoterapia è stata somministrata tramite occhialini nasali. Il personale presente all’interno della sala di emodinamica è stato ridotto al minimo (tre chirurghi vascolari ed un infermiere di sala operatoria) per abbattere il rischio infettivo e l’impiego di dispositivi di protezione individuale. Oltre alla divisa, al camice piombato ed agli occhiali schermati, il personale presente nella stanza era dotato di un doppio camice chirurgico, due paia di guanti, visiera protettiva, maschera FFP2 e copri scarpe. La procedura si è svolta regolarmente e circa 6 ore dopo il termine la paziente è stata trasferita nel reparto di malattie infettive. Non si sono verificate complicanze chirurgiche né respiratorie e la paziente è stata dimessa in quattordicesima giornata post-operatoria. Al fine di evitare la mobilizzazione della paziente al di fuori del reparto di malattie infettive e data la risoluzione delle algie toraciche ed il decorso post-operatorio favorevole, il controllo angio-TC non è stato eseguito durante il ricovero ma è stato programmato a distanza di circa sei mesi dall’intervento."

It can be treated conservatively if it develops in a retrograde form or manifests as an intramural hematoma (IMH) with a micro-intimal tear in the absence of instability. However, only a few reports exist on its natural course and long-term outcomes. A 78-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with acute chest discomfort. Elective cardiac catheterization was performed via the right radial artery. The patient's brachiocephalic artery was so tortuous that the hydrophilic soft guidewire had to be exchanged for a stiffer one. However, the stiff wire caused the dissection of a tortuous brachiocephalic artery that extended from the sinuses of Valsalva to the proximal descending aorta. Emergent computed tomography showed crescentic aortic wall thickening without a dissection flap. The patient had cardiac tamponade and a gradually thickening thrombosed false lumen. Although the patient was unstable during the first 2 weeks, she was stabilized during hospital stay with only conservative treatment. Consequently, she has been well for over 5 years. Even though the patient showed ominous findings, a good prognosis was expected because the AD was mainly retrograde. Furthermore, the thrombosed false lumen mimicked an IMH on imaging. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an extensive iatrogenic AD originating from the brachiocephalic artery during right transradial catheterization that was treated conservatively despite clinical instability."

A total of 174 responses were obtained from the surgeons across the country. An effective consensus was obtained for the following: (i) emergency surgery in acute type A aortic dissection, (ii) urgent surgery in significant left main stem disease and mitral/aortic valves with pulmonary oedema, (iii) elective surgery in stable triple vessel disease and (iv) preoperative nasal swab examination for all patients undergoing surgery. In the present era, where evidence is evolving and the country is entering a phase after lockdown, the surgeons face a dilemma in operating patients.

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a life-threatening disease that requires emergent surgical intervention. This retrospective study aimed to clarify the individual characteristics, short-term and mid-term outcomes, and prognostic factors of patients who underwent surgical repair of ATAAD with preoperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Between January 2007 and January 2020, 656 consecutive patients underwent ATAAD repair at our institution; 22 (3.4%) of these patients underwent CPR prior to surgery. Patients who underwent preoperative CPR were classified as the survivor group (n = 9) and non-survivor group (n = 13), according to whether they survived to hospital discharge. Clinical features, surgical information, and postoperative complications were analyzed and compared. Three-year cumulative survival rates and cerebral performance categories (CPC) scores are presented. In patients undergoing CPR prior to ATAAD surgery, the in-hospital mortality rate was 59.1%. A total of 72.7% of patients underwent concomitant surgical resuscitation procedures during CPR such as emergent subxiphoid pericardiotomy and/or emergent cardiopulmonary bypass. The survivor group had a higher rate of return of spontaneous heartbeat (ROSB) compared to the non-survivor group (100% versus 53.8%; P = 0.017). The 3-year cumulative survival rates were 35.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 27.6%-42.6%) and 85.7% (95% CI, 81.9%-88.8%) for overall patients and for survivors, respectively. As for the neurological outcome, 77.8% (7/9) of patients had full cerebral performance (CPC-1) at the 3-month follow-up examination after discharge. Patients with ATAAD undergoing preoperative CPR, especially those without ROSB after CPR, are at high risk for in-hospital mortality. However, the short-term and mid-term outcomes, including the cerebral performance after discharge and 3-year survival rate, are promising for patients who survived to discharge."

    "abstract": "A 61-year-old male presented to the emergency ward with pain in his upper abdomen. Due to an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) and elevated cardiac enzymes the cardiologist was consulted to exclude cardiac pathology. The consulting cardiologist advised to exclude an abdominal diagnosis before treating the condition as an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Before noninvasive imaging had been performed, the clinical situation deteriorated and an emergency laparotomy revealed a ruptured aortic aneurysm. Despite immediate revascularization multiple organ failure ensued and the patient died a few days later. This case illustrates that the suspicion of ACS should never delay the investigation of other life-threatening disorders. Contrarily angina, ECG abnormalities, and myocardial ischemia are all well known to concur with major vascular, intra-abdominal, intra-cranial, and pulmonary pathology; hence these other life-threatening conditions should always be considered and preferably be ruled out prior to further investigation and treatment of ACS."

    "abstract": "Aortic aneurysm ruptures are associated with high fatality. The timely diagnosis of a ruptured aortic aneurysm can be challenging for the emergency physician when hoarseness of voice is the only presenting symptom. Ortner's syndrome was first reported in 1897 as a case of left recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis secondary to mitral stenosis and left atrial enlargement. In this case report, we describe a unique association of aortic aneurysm rupture with dysphonia presenting as Ortner's syndrome. An 81-year-old man presented to our emergency department (ED) with an acute hoarse voice. Physical examination of his cardiovascular and neurologic systems was normal. Further evaluation with a nasoendoscope revealed a left vocal cord palsy. Consideration of Ortner's syndrome prompted an early call for thoracic imaging. A computed tomogram of the aorta showed a contained aortic aneurysm rupture with an acute hyperdense periaortic hematoma at the aortic arch. As our patient was a poor surgical candidate in view of concurrent comorbidities, he was managed conservatively. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: We identified a unique presentation of a painless, ruptured aortic aneurysm. This is a fatal diagnosis that all emergency physicians struggle to make in a timely fashion. The imminent aortic aneurysm rupture, masked by the absence of pain in our patient, could have resulted in a potentially catastrophic event. In the evaluation of a patient with hoarse voice, early consideration of Ortner's syndrome could result in timely diagnosis of a ruptured aortic aneurysm."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection carries a high mortality of up to 40% at the time of initial dissection and an additional 1% per hour the dissection is untreated. Patients with acute aortic dissection most commonly present with chest or back pain. Less frequently, it manifests without pain with predominant neurologic symptoms secondary to an acute stroke. We present the case of a 53-year-old male presenting with acute onset aphasia and right-sided weakness. Incidentally, CT angiography of his neck revealed a carotid artery dissection, which was found an extension of a Stanford type A acute aortic dissection resulting in a large vessel occlusion stroke. The patient's concomitant pathologies resulted in uncertainty as to the priority of management between the interventional neurology and cardiothoracic surgery services, ultimately resulting in the transfer of the patient to an aorta specialist at an outside facility. This case highlights several areas of difficulty in the management of patients with presenting with both large vessel occlusion stroke and acute aortic dissection and the need for consideration of acute aortic dissection in patients presenting with symptoms consistent with large vessel occlusion stroke. Optimal blood pressure control is unknown, as is the ideal timing of aortic repair and the potential for endovascular therapy for large vessel occlusion stroke in the setting of acute aortic dissection. Emergency physicians must rapidly engage with neurology, interventional neurology, and cardiothoracic surgery to determine appropriate interventions and timing of operative repair. The emergency physician must consider acute aortic dissection in patients presenting with signs and symptoms concerning for large vessel occlusion stroke, even if they have no complaint of chest pain, as administration of thrombolytics in these patients may be deadly."

With the technological developments in its management, arterial cannulation technique of direct true lumen cannulation has emerged with improved outcomes. We aimed to compare the mortality and morbidity outcomes between direct true lumen and conventional cannulation techniques for arterial access in patients with acute type- A aortic dissection under a single-centre retrospective review from 2007 to 2017. Mean age of the participants was 43.3±11.6 vs 45±12.4 years with males being dominant in both groups. Frequency of overall morbidity was high in conventional cannulation group (Group-B), though it did not attain statistical significance, (p>0.999). Mortality rate was also high in Group-B (10% vs 30%), (p=0.582). Direct true lumen cannulation is an equally reliable option for establishing cardiopulmonary bypass due to reduced mortality and morbidity and may be given preference when dissection is extending into femoral and innominate arteries."

We also aimed this study to assess decision on prioritization of the surgical patients, the need for personal protection equipment, and the choice of preoperative investigations in current dynamic and fluid climate. A validated web-based questionnaire was constructed and was circulated to the international surgeons amongst high volume cardiac and aortic surgery centers. Their intrinsic feedback on decision making, the impact of the lockdown, and perspectives for the future ahead of us all were noted. A mixed-method approach was constructed. Qualitative data analysis was introduced to signify the impact globally. Overall, 23 centers from 18 countries participated in this international study. About 91.7% of the respondents stopped operating on elective patients during the pandemic. The majority of the surgeons agreed that acute aortic dissection (87.1%) should be operated as an emergency procedure and stable triple vessel disease (87.1%) to be considered as an elective procedure. Three-fifth (60%) of the respondents relied on computerized tomography chest as a preoperative screening modality. In the present climate where there is a paucity of evidence, this will give an interim consensus for the cardiac surgeons.

Using label-free approach, a total of 22 differentially expressed proteins were identified in the serum samples of the AAD group, of which 15 were upregulated and 7 were downregulated as compared to the AMI and healthy control groups. The most prominent increased protein was vinculin, which was selected to validate in total samples. The level of vinculin was significantly elevated in AAD patients (15.8 ng/ml, IQR: 9.3-19.9 ng/ml) than that in AMI patients (8.6 ng/ml, IQR:5.3-11.4 ng/ml) and healthy volunteers (5.3 ng/ml, IQR:2.8-7.6 ng/ml), P < 0.0001. Furthermore, the concentration of vinculin both increased in type A and B dissection. At the early stage of AAD, vinculin maintained a high level to 48 hours compared with that of AMI. Our study demonstrated that vinculin may play a role in the early diagnosis of AAD."

Data from all patients treated at our Department since the decision of the regional healthcare authorities of Lombardy to centralize surgical specialties creating a hub/spoke system (March 9, 2020) were prospectively collected and compared with a retrospectively collected cohort from the same period of year 2019. Primary study end point was defined as primary clinical success. Secondary end points were defined as in-hospital mortality and/or any in hospital major adverse event or lower limb amputation. One hundred sixteen patients were treated (81 men, 70%; median age: 71 years, IQR 65-81). Thirty-two patients (28%) were addressed from spoke hospitals directly referring to our hub, 19 (16%) from hospitals belonging to other hub/spoke nets, 48 (41%) came directly from our emergency department, and 17 (15%) were already hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia. Acute limb ischemia was the most observed disease, occurring in 31 (26.7%), 12 (38.7%) of whom were found positive for COVID-19 pneumonia on admission, whereas 3 (9.7%) became positive during hospitalization. Chronic limb ischemia was the indication to treatment in 24 (20.7%) patients. Six (5.2%) patients underwent primary amputation for irreversible ischemia. Aortic emergencies included 21 cases (18.1%), including 13 (61.9%) symptomatic abdominal aortic or iliac aneurysms, 4 (19.0%) thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, 2 (9.5%) cases of acute type B aortic dissection (one post-traumatic). Seventeen (14.7%) patients were admitted for symptomatic carotid stenosis (no COVID-19 patients); all of them underwent carotid endarterectomy. Seventeen (14.7%) cases were treated for other vascular emergencies. Overall, at a median follow-up of 23 ± 13 days, primary clinical success was 87.1% and secondary clinical success was 95.9%. We recorded 3 in-hospital deaths for an overall mortality rate of 2.6%. Compared with the 2019 cohort, \"COVID era\" patients were older (72 vs. 63 years, P = 0.002), more frequently transferred from other hospitals (44% vs. 21%, P = 0.014) and more frequently with decompensated chronic limb threatening ischemia (21% vs. 3%, P = 0.015); surgical outcomes were similar between the 2 cohorts. Since its appearance, SARS-CoV-2 has been testing all national healthcare systems which founds themselves facing an unprecedented emergency. Late referral in the pandemic period could seriously worsen limb prognosis; this aspect should be known and addressed by health care providers. Vascular surgical outcomes in pre-COVID and COVID era were comparable in our experience."

Of these, 28 patients with non-A non-B dissection (classified as dissection extending into the aortic arch with entry between the left common carotid artery and the left subclavian arteries) underwent a novel hybrid surgery. Self modified stent-grafts (Micropart Corp, Shanghai, China) were implanted via median sternotomy. Clinical presentation, postoperative data, and early outcomes were recorded. All patients underwent an emergency operation. There were no in-hospital mortalities, reexplorations for hemorrhage, reports of paraplegia, cerebral infarctions, endoleaks, or left subclavian artery occlusions. No blood products were required during or after the operations. During the early follow-up at 39.12 ± 15.04 months (6.0-74.0 months), 1 patient was lost to follow-up, and 1 patient died suddenly. Computed tomography angiography showed false lumen patency persisted in the aortic arch and descending aorta without any symptoms. The 6-month computed tomography angiography showed significantly smaller distal aortic arch diameters (31.94 ± 6.95 mm) and descending aorta diameters (34.84 ± 4.15 mm) than measured preoperatively (36.76 ± 4.15 mm and 37.31 ± 4.7 mm, respectively). No paraplegia, cerebral infarction, upper limb ischemia, or left subclavian artery ischemia events were reported. Our inclusion aortic arch technique is a safe, effective, and simple treatment for non-A non-B aortic dissections that can avoid endoleaks, requires no blood products, and has satisfactory early outcomes."

We systematically searched Medline and Scopus to identify all observational cohort studies published before January 2020 that compared outcome (short-term mortality) in patients with AAD with high vs low levels of baseline NT-proBNP combining terms \"brain natriuretic peptide\" and \"aortic dissection.\" A meta-analysis was conducted using the generic inverse variance method. Heterogeneity between studies was investigated using the Cochrane's Q test and I2 statistic. Four studies were included in final analysis including a total of 950 patients, and 105 (11%) patients died. Baseline NT-proBNP concentrations were significantly higher in nonsurvivors (median 2240 pg/mL, range 1678-16 347 pg/mL) when compared to survivors (665 pg/mL, 328-1252 pg/mL). Elevated NT-proBNP values were significantly associated with an increased risk of short-term mortality (odds ratio 4.13, 95% CI [confidence interval] 2.33-7.33), with low heterogeneity (I2 = 8.77%, Cochran Q = 2.19, P = .33), and no publication bias. The pooled standardized mean difference between groups was 1.28 (95% CI 0.99-1.56), with low heterogeneity (I2 = 38.73%, Cochran Q = 3.26, P = .19). Elevated NT-proBNP levels on admission are associated with an increased risk of short-term mortality in AAD."

    "abstract": "A 38-yr-old man presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain and was found to have a type A aortic dissection. Forty-eight hours after an emergency mechanical Bentall and ascending hemiarch replacement, the patient developed agitation prompting administration of high-dose haloperidol. He was found to have evidence of multiple acute infarcts on head computed tomography/computed tomography angiography and brain magnetic resonance imaging. Four days later, he began to complain of jaw pain and difficulty opening his mouth. After admission to inpatient rehabilitation, he was found to have strong activity in the masseters bilaterally at rest on electromyography, indicating a diagnosis of oromandibular dystonia. Starting in the intensive care unit, the patient reported jaw pain and dysfunction for 40 days before having a diagnosis of oromandibular dystonia. At this point, treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA injections and baclofen did not provide relief. Because of an extended delay in diagnosis, it is believed that the patient has developed joint contractures. Oromandibular dystonia is an important diagnosis to consider in patients who experience jaw pain or difficulty with mouth opening. Treatment of this condition can decrease pain and trauma to oral structures as well as improve ability to perform oral hygiene, eat, and communicate."

The patient underwent fenestrated thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for closure of the entry site, and reconstruction of the left subclavian artery with a covered stent. On the 40th postoperative day, a retrograde type A aortic dissection (RTAD) was observed on computed tomography and she underwent emergency surgery. The entry tear, related to the proximal bare metal stent, was located in front of the aortic arch. A partial aortic arch replacement was performed. Consideration of the risk factors of RTAD is important when performing TEVAR."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is a cardiovascular disease with high mortality and morbidity rates. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in predicting in-hospital mortality in patients undergoing emergent surgery for Stanford type A aortic dissection. Patients operated for acute Stanford type A aortic dissection between January 2010 and December 2018 were included in the study. Patients without in-hospital mortality were classified as Group 1, and patients with mortality were classified as Group 2. One-hundred-eighteen patients were involved in the study. Patient mean age was 57 ± 11.7 years, and 89 patients (75.4%) were male. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil counts, and C-reactive protein (CRP) values at the time of admission also were found to be high in Group 2 (P = .001, .021, < .001, < .001 respectively). Total perfusion times (TPt), antegrade cerebral perfusion time (ACPt), cross-clamp time (CCt), and intensive care unit (ICU) stay periods significantly were higher in the mortality group (P < .001, < .001, = .01, and < .001, respectively). In receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, a cut-off level of 23 mg/L was determined for CRP levels that predict progression to mortality (area under the curve (AUC): 0.879, P < .001, 75.0% sensitivity and 58.0% specificity). Similarly, a cut-off level of 8.8 was found for NLR that predicts progression to mortality (AUC: 0.835, P < .001, 76.0% sensitivity and 61.0% specificity). As a result, we can use CRP and NLR values, which easily can be measured or calculated from blood tests to predict mortality in patients with aortic dissections, which may have serious mortal consequences."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the 18-year results of emergency operations for acute type A aortic dissection, especially in octogenarians. We reviewed 199 patients who underwent surgical aortic repair of an acute type A aortic dissection from January 2001 to December 2018. If the primary entry existed in the ascending aorta, we limited the extent of the replacement to within the ascending aorta. We analysed the early and late outcomes and identified the predictive factors for in-hospital death and difficulty of direct discharge to home. The hospital mortality was 16%. The causes of death were postoperative bleeding (n = 8, 4%), intestinal ischaemia (n = 6, 3%), respiratory failure (n = 5, 3%), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (n = 4, 2%), low output syndrome (n = 3, 2%), sudden death (n = 3, 2%), myonephrotic metabolic syndrome (n = 2, 1%) and stroke (n = 1, 1%). Multivariable analysis revealed that an estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 (P = 0.006), malperfusion (P = 0.001), rupture (P < 0.001) and cross-clamping time (P = 0.003) were independent predictive factors of in-hospital death. Age was not a significant factor for predicting in-hospital death. Ascending aorta replacement (P = 0.013), advanced age (P = 0.002) and prolonged extracorporeal circulation time (P = 0.009) were independent predictive factors of difficulty in direct discharge to home. In the late follow-up period, the 5-year survival and aortic event-free rates were 62.2% and 88.9% in octogenarians, respectively. From the perspective of saving lives, the results of emergency surgery for octogenarians were acceptable. Avoiding the postoperative decline in activities of daily living in octogenarians is a consideration going forward."

    "abstract": "We studied early poor postoperative prognosis in acute Stanford type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) patients and investigated the predictive effect of interleukin-6 (IL-6) combined with D-dimer in the early poor postoperative prognosis after ATAAD. Data on 141 ATAAD patients, who underwent emergency surgery between January 2018 and December 2018 at our hospital, were studied. We analyzed early postoperative prognosis using two patient groups. Patients with good prognosis were included in group A and those with poor prognosis were in group B. Univariate logistic and multivariable logistic regression analysis were performed for poor early postoperative prognosis. Preoperative IL-6 level was lower (57.8 ± 39.0 vs 211.0 ± 153.7 pg/mL, p < 0.001) and the D-dimer was also lower (7.3 ± 6.1 vs. 16.7 ± 5.8 μg/mL, p < 0.001) in group A than in B. The cut-off points, determined by the ROC curve, were preoperative IL-6 > 108 pg/mL (area under the curve: AUC = 0.901) and D-dimer > 14.0 μg/mL (AUC = 0.817). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that IL-6 > 108 pg/mL, D-dimer > 14.0 μg/mL, prothrombin time > 15 s, creatinine > 135 mmol/mL, and operation time > 306 min for ATAAD appeared to be early postoperative risk factors of poor prognosis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that IL-6 > 108 pg/mL and D-dimer > 14.0 μg/mL were early postoperative risk factors for poor prognosis after ATAAD, and the odds ratios (ORs) of IL-6 > 108 pg/mL and D-dimer > 14.0 μg/mL were 24.937 (6.837, 90.931) and 18.757 (5.094, 69.075), respectively. When IL-6 was > 108 pg/mL (AUC = 0.901), the sensitivity and specificity of predicting early postoperative prognosis after ATAAD were 79.4 and 89.7%, respectively (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.839 to 0.963). When D-dimer was > 14.0 g/mL (AUC = 0.817), the sensitivity and specificity were 82.4 and 84.1%, respectively (95% CI 0.731 to 0.903). When combined with D-dimer (AUC = 0.936) (95% CI 0.793 to 0.979), the AUC values were more predictive than those for the individual marker. IL-6 > 108 pg/mL and D-dimer > 14.0 μg/mL is of high predictive value for the assessment of early poor postoperative prognosis after ATAAD. And IL-6 > 108 pg/mL in combination with D-dimer > 14.0 μg/mL is of higher predictive value."

The Ascyrus Medical Dissection Stent (AMDS; Ascyrus Medical, Boca Raton, FL) is a hybrid prosthesis that seals and depressurizes the FL at the distal anastomosis while expanding and pressurizing the TL. The Dissected Aorta Repair Through Stent Implantation trial is a prospective, nonrandomized, international type A dissection trial where patients with acute DeBakey I dissections were enrolled between March 2017 and January 2019. Forty-seven patients were enrolled (median age, 62.5; 67.4% men) with a median follow-up of 631 days. All patients underwent emergent surgical repair with successful AMDS implantation. One patient was excluded because of use in iatrogenic dissection. Overall mortality at 30 days and 1 year was 13.0% (6/46) and 19.6% (9/46), whereas new strokes occurred in 6.5% (3/46). Over 95% of vessel malperfusions resolved because of AMDS-induced TL expansion, including 3 patients with preoperative paralysis. Positive remodeling of the aortic arch occurred in 100% of cases with complete obliteration or thrombosis of the FL in 74%. In the proximal descending thoracic aorta positive remodeling occurred in 77% and complete obliteration or FL thrombosis in 53% of cases. AMDS facilitates single-stage management of malperfusion and induces positive remodeling of the aortic arch through effective sealing of the distal anastomotic FL, depressurization of the FL with expansion, and pressurization of the TL. Importantly the use of AMDS is safe and reproducible."

Understanding the chronological patterns of AAD onset would be helpful for identifying the triggers of AAD and preventing this catastrophic event. We collected data from 2048 patients diagnosed with AAD at Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China) from 2011 to 2018. The χ2 test was used to determine whether a specific period had significantly different seasonal/weekly distributions from other periods. Fourier models were used to analyse the rhythmicity in monthly/circadian distribution. The mean age was 53.4±10.9 years, and 1161 patients (56.7%) were under 55 years. One thousand six hundred fifty-seven patients (80.9%) were male, and 935 cases (45.7%) were type A dissections. The proportions of patients with comorbid hypertension/diabetes were 60.3% (1234 cases) and 1.8% (36 cases), respectively. A peak was identified in colder periods (winter/December) and a trough in warmer periods (summer/June). No significant variation was observed in weekly distribution. Fourier analysis showed a statistically significant circadian variation (p<0.001) with a nocturnal trough in 2:00-3:00, a morning peak in 9:00-10:00, and an afternoon peak in 16:00-17:00. Subgroup analyses identified circadian rhythmicity in all subgroups except for the female group and younger group (younger than 55 years). Our results confirmed that the onset of AAD exhibits significant seasonal, monthly and circadian patterns. Patients with AAD with different Stanford-type dissections, sexes, ages and hypertension statuses could present different circadian variations. These findings may provide novel perspectives for identifying the triggers of AAD and better preventing this catastrophic event."

This study aimed to examine emergency cardiac surgery after PCI in England and Wales and postsurgical patient outcomes. We analyzed patients in the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society database who underwent PCI between 2007 and 2014 and compared characteristics and outcomes for patients with and without emergency cardiac surgery. A total of 549,303 patients were included in the analysis and 362 (0.07%) underwent emergency cardiac surgery. There was a modest decline in the annual rate of emergency cardiac surgery from 0.09% to 0.06% between 2007 and 2014. Variables associated with emergency cardiac surgery included receipt of circulatory support (Odds ratio (OR) 39.20 95% confidence interval (CI) 27.75 to 55.36), aortic dissection (OR 28.39 95%CI 14.59 to 55.26), coronary dissection (OR 18.50 95%CI 13.60 to 25.18), coronary perforation (OR 7.86 95%CI 4.27 to 14.46), cardiac tamponade (OR 6.77 95%CI 3.13 to 14.66), and on-site surgical cover (OR 2.15 95%CI 1.56 to 2.97). After adjustments, patients with emergency cardiac surgery were at increased odds of 30-day mortality (OR 4.41 95%CI 2.94 to 6.62) and in-hospital major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (OR 1.63 95%CI 1.07 to 2.48). On site surgical cover was independently associated with increased odds of mortality (OR 1.26 95%CI 1.20 to 1.33) following emergency cardiac surgery. In conclusion, emergency cardiac surgery after PCI is a rarely required procedure and in England and Wales there appears to be a decline in recent years. Patients who underwent emergency cardiac surgery have higher risk of adverse outcomes and longer length of hospital stay."

Frozen elephant trunk (FET) enables false lumen exclusion downstream but is still debated in AAD due to its greater dimension of surgery. To combine the benefits of fast proximal repair with the FET benefits, a 3-zone hybrid graft was developed consisting of an ascending polyester portion, an arch noncovered stent, and a descending stent graft. Mid-term results of this new technique are presented. A total of 6 patients (age mean 69 years) with type I AAD in critical status (Penn classification B n = 5, BC n = 1) were operated between July 2016 and April 2018 using the 3-zone hybrid graft. The device was implanted on the basis of strict compassionate use. Operations were performed under distal hypothermic circulatory arrest and selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (SACP). Operative mortality was 17% (n = 1). Mean crossclamp and SACP time were 92 and 34 minutes, respectively, but came down in the last 2 cases to 75/65 crossclamp and 23/24 SACP minutes each. During follow up, mean 19 ± 12 months, one endovascular extension downstream was performed. Imaging control demonstrated no anastomotic-related proximal entry and no true lumen collapse downstream. The goal to achieve fast and reliable repair of complicated type I AAD down to midthoracic level seems to be achievable.

    "abstract": "Within the spectrum of acute aortic syndromes, intramural hematoma (IMH) is a distinct lesion that is characterized by crescentic or circumferential thickening of the aortic wall in the absence of an intimal defect. The reported incidence of IMH among all type A acute aortic syndromes ranges from 3.5% to 28.3%. As compared with acute aortic dissection, IMH is a disease of the elderly, and it tends to have reduced rates of malperfusion syndromes, aortic insufficiency, and root dilation, yet also tends to have increased rates of pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, and periaortic hematoma. With respect to natural history, IMH may progress to classic dissection, frank rupture, or aneurysmal dilation; yet, IMH may also regress and be completely resorbed. However, studies disagree over the rates of progression or regression; as such, few studies agree on the short-term and long-term prognosis associated with IMH. American and European guidelines advocate emergent surgery for all acutely presenting type A IMH. At a minimum, supracoronary replacement of the aorta with hemiarch reconstruction is the preferred extent of operative repair to reduce rates of long-term reintervention for disease progression. However, valve and/or root procedures may be necessary proximally, while total arch reconstruction or hybrid procedures for the descending aorta may be necessary distally. Much remains unknown for IMH, including the ideal extent of aortic repair, risk-stratification for elderly patients, and the optimal treatment paradigm for stable, uncomplicated IMH. As such, IMH remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for the cardiovascular surgeon."

We retrospectively investigated whether these factors differed between octogenarians and younger patients with AAD. The records of 207 patients who underwent emergency surgery for AAD were reviewed between 2008 and 2014. We compared the total volumes of transfused blood components (red blood cell concentrate, fresh frozen plasma, platelets concentrate, and cryoprecipitate), perioperative blood coagulation test results (prothrombin time-international normalized ratio, activated partial thrombin time, and activated coagulation time), and intensive care unit and hospital stay durations between octogenarians (n = 33) and patients < 80 years old (n = 170).

    "abstract": "Patients with a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) frequently develop aneurysms of the aortic root and tubular ascending aorta. Aneurysms of the aortic arch, in the absence of concomitant aortopathies, are much less common. According to the 2018 American Association of Thoracic Surgery consensus guidelines on BAV-related aortopathy, prophylactic surgical aortic repair / replacement is recommended starting at a maximum aortic diameter of 50 mm in patients with risk factors. Concomitant aortic surgery is also recommended at an aortic diameter of 45 mm in those patients with other indications for cardiac surgery (most commonly aortic valve procedures). The ultimate goal of prophylactic aortic surgery is the prevention of aortic catastrophes, e.g. aortic rupture or acute aortic dissection, which are associated with high morbidity and mortality. The surgical technique used - in elective and emergency cases - depends on the involvement and nature of the aortic valve disease, as well as the extent of aortic aneurysm formation. The current review focusses on the surgical management of the aortic root, tubular ascending aorta, and proximal aortic arch in BAV patients. Despite the abovementioned recommendations, many BAV patients develop acute aortic syndromes below the recommended aortic diameter thresholds. Further research is therefore required in order to identify high-risk BAV subgroups that would benefit from earlier surgical repair."

In addition, APN OE inhibited the productions of gasdermin D (GSDMD), NLRP3, caspase1, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-18, and osteopontin (OPN), as well as α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) downregulation in vitro and in vivo. In addition, NLRP3 was found to be a target gene of miR-133a and miR-133a OE showed similar effects to APN OE in attenuating the LPS-induced productions of GSDMD, NLRP3, caspase1, IL-1β, IL-18, and OPN, as well as α-SMA downregulation in vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs). Moreover, the beneficial effects of APN OE were abolished by miR-133a knockdown in vSMCs. In conclusion, our present results indicated that the upregulation of miR-133a by APN inhibits pyroptosis pathway, which potentially rescues AAD."

    "abstract": "Patients with acute type A aortic dissection demonstrate a wide range of aortic insufficiency. Outcomes after valve resuspension and root repair are not well studied in the long term. We evaluated the long-term effects of preoperative aortic insufficiency in patients undergoing emergency root-preserving surgery for acute type A aortic dissection. From 2002 to 2017, 558 of 776 patients with acute type A aortic dissection underwent native aortic valve resuspension and root reconstruction. Patients were stratified into 4 groups by preoperative aortic insufficiency grade (n = 539): aortic insufficiency less than 2+ (n = 348), aortic insufficiency = 2+ (n = 72), aortic insufficiency = 3+ (n = 49), and aortic insufficiency = 4+ (n = 70). Multivariable ordinal longitudinal mixed effects and multi-state transition models were used to assess risk factors for recurrent aortic insufficiency. The prevalence of cardiogenic shock in patients presenting with preoperative aortic insufficiency less than 2+, 2+, 3+, and 4+ was 53 of 348 (15.2%), 12 of 72 (16.7%), 10 of 49 (20.4%), and 24 of 70 (34.3%), respectively (P = .002). Postoperatively, 94.0% of patients had aortic insufficiency 1+ or less at discharge. Operative mortality was 34 of 348 (9.8%), 10 of 72 (13.9%), 6 of 49 (12.2%), and 12 of 70 (17.1%) (P = .303). In an ordinal mixed effects model, preoperative aortic insufficiency was associated with more severe postoperative aortic insufficiency. The multi-state transition model demonstrated that severe aortic insufficiency was associated with progression from no to mild aortic insufficiency (hazard ratio, 2.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.35-3.38), and progression from mild to moderate aortic insufficiency (hazard ratio, 5.70; 95% confidence interval, 1.88-17.30). Preoperative aortic insufficiency is an important predictor of recurrent aortic insufficiency in patients undergoing valve resuspension with root reconstruction for emergency acute type A aortic dissection repair. Increased echocardiographic surveillance for recurrent aortic insufficiency may be warranted in this cohort."

    "abstract": "Cardiac tamponade is a pericardial syndrome characterised by an impairment of the diastolic filling of the ventricles causing reduction of cardiac output, usually producing signs and symptoms of cardiac arrest, if untreated. The main causes of cardiac tamponade include percutaneous cardiac interventions, malignacies, infectious/inflammatory causes, mechanical complications of myocardial infarction and aortic dissection. The diagnosis of cardiac tamponade is a clinical diagnosis based on a suggestive history and clinical presentation with worsening dyspnoea, distended jugular veins, muffled heart sounds and pulsus paradoxus, and should be confirmed by echocardiography. Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening syndrome that requires urgent treatment by pericardiocentesis. Pericardiocentesis is an interventional technique to drain pericardial fluid by a percutaneous route. The standard technique for pericardiocentesis is guided by echocardiography or fluoroscopy under local anaesthesia. Pericardiocentesis should be performed by experienced operators and carries a variable risk of complications, mainly cardiac chamber puncture, arrhythmias (ventricular arrhythmias suggest puncture of the ventricle), coronary artery puncture or haemothorax, pneumothorax, pneumopericardium and hepatic injury. The prognosis of cardiac tamponade is essentially related to aetiology. Cardiac tamponade in patients with cancer and metastatic involvement of the pericardium has a bad short-term prognosis because it is a sign of advanced cancer, on the contrary, patients with cardiac tamponade and a final diagnosis of idiopathic pericarditis generally have a good long-term prognosis."

    "abstract": "The incidence of elderly patients with acute type A aortic dissection is increasing. A recent analysis of the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection failed to show a mortality benefit with surgery compared with medical management in octogenarians. Therefore, we compared our institutional outcomes of emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection in octogenarians versus septuagenarians to understand the outcomes of surgical intervention in elderly patients. From 2002 to 2017, 70 octogenarians (aged ≥80 years) and 165 septuagenarians (70-79 years) underwent surgery for acute type A aortic dissection (N = 235, total). Quality of life was assessed by the RAND Short Form-36 quality of life survey. Midterm clinical and functional data were obtained retrospectively. At baseline, septuagenarians had a higher prevalence of diabetes (20.6% vs 5.7%, P = .01). The prevalence of cardiopulmonary resuscitation was 4.8% versus 10.0% (P = .24) in septuagenarians and octogenarians. The prevalence of cardiogenic shock was 18.2% versus 27.1% (P = .17). Thirty-day/in-hospital mortality was 21.2% versus 28.6% (P = .29). Multivariable logistic regression identified cardiogenic shock as an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 10.07; 95% confidence interval, 2.30-44.03) in octogenarians. Survival at 5 years was 49.7% (42.1%-58.6%) versus 34.2% (23.9%-48.8%) in septuagenarians and octogenarians, respectively. Responses to the quality of life survey were no different between septuagenarians and octogenarians across all 8 quality of life categories. Clinical outcomes after surgery for acute type A aortic dissection are similar in octogenarians and septuagenarians. For discharged survivors, quality of life remains favorable and does not differ between the 2 groups."

A 67-year-old female presented with chest pain and left-sided hemiparesis and was diagnosed with extensive type A acute aortic dissection and ischaemic stroke secondary to right common carotid artery stenosis. She underwent two major operations (emergency dissection repair and hemicraniectomy) and sustained several complications.

Here, we report a very rare case of aortic dissection leading to bilateral cerebral cortex ischaemia and epilepsy. A 54-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with acute onset of right limb weakness accompanied by slurred speech. He had a history of hypertension as well as tobacco and alcohol use. The patient was found to have aphasia and right hemiplegia on physical examination. No bleeding was seen on the skull CT. Acute cerebral infarction was considered after admission, and rt-PA was administered for intravenous thrombolysis. During intravenous thrombolysis, the patient suddenly developed epilepsy, and diazepam was given immediately by intravenous injection to control the symptoms. Emergency skull diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was performed, and the results showed a small, patchy, high signal that was scattered throughout the left brain hemisphere, right frontal parietal lobe and centrum semiovale. Head and neck CT angiography (CTA) was performed; dissection was found in the ascending aorta, aortic arch, bilateral common carotid artery, proximal part of the internal carotid artery, and initial segment of the left external carotid artery. The laceration was located in the upper part of the ascending aorta. AoD complicated by acute cerebral infarction and epilepsy was considered, and the patient was immediately transferred to the cardiovascular surgery specialist hospital for surgical treatment. Some aortic dissections have no typical manifestations of chest pain, and the onset is covert. Atypical clinical manifestations of epilepsy secondary to bilateral cerebral hemisphere infarction may appear. AoD with cerebral infarction is a contraindication for intravenous thrombolysis; surgical treatment is the best way to reduce mortality."

    "abstract": "Patients with acute type A aortic dissection with a previous cardiac surgery (PCS) and malperfusion syndrome (MPS) are extremely difficult to manage and have poor outcomes. From 1996 to 2018, 668 patients underwent emergent open aortic repair or endovascular fenestration/stenting for MPS for an acute type A aortic dissection, including those with PCS (PCS, n = 64) and those without PCS (No-PCS, n = 604). The groups were further divided into PCS+MPS, PCS+No-MPS, No-PCS+MPS, and No-PCS+No-MPS. Compared with the No-PCS group, the PCS group had significantly more coronary artery disease, acute renal failure, and mesenteric and renal MPS. Forty-two percent of patients with PCS underwent upfront endovascular fenestration/stenting for endovascular-amendable MPS. The in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with PCS+MPS (40%) compared with PCS+No-MPS (5.9%), No-PCS+MPS (30%), and No-PCS+No-MPS (6.7%). Multivariable logistic regression showed cardiogenic shock (odds ratio, 7.3) and MPS (odds ratio, 6.6) were risk factors for in-hospital mortality (P < .001). After recovering from MPS the PCS group (n = 54) had similar rates of postoperative complications, including 30-day mortality (7.4% vs 6.3%, P = .77), compared with the No-PCS group (n = 557). The 5-year survival was significantly lower in the PCS group compared with the No-PCS group (60% vs 72%, P = .004) and was lowest in those with PCS+MPS (46%). PCS was not a significant risk factor for in-hospital (odds ratio, 1.2; P = .63) or late (hazard ratio, 1.3; P = .27) mortality. Because of severe preoperative comorbidities and the complexity of open aortic repair, in acute type A aortic dissection patients with PCS and MPS, endovascular fenestration and stenting first with delayed redo sternotomy and central aortic repair was a valid approach."

This cardiac disease has a high mortality, particularly Stanford type A, which involves the first part of the aorta. Aortic dissection is characterized by urgent onset, rapid progress, and poor outcome [Nienaber 2003; Mehta 2002]. Surgery is the most effective treatment. Although there have been remarkable recent advances in the understanding and management of various aspects of these complex surgeries, many potential complications remain. Non-traumatic splenic rupture is a rare postoperative complication of type A aortic dissection, and there are only a few published reports discussing this complication. Splenic rupture is a life-threatening cause of intraperitoneal bleeding and often is associated with the preexisting pathology of the spleen in the absence of trauma [Renzulli 2009]. Its manifestation is characterized by abdominal pain, left shoulder pain, and even shock. Because of the history of aortic dissection, physicians initially may suspect arterial rupture. In our report, we aim to present the possibility of splenic rupture as a complication of aortic dissection surgery and the need for immediate surgical intervention."

Despite advancements in operative technique and increased specialization of cardiovascular care, operative mortality, and morbidity after repair of type A aortic dissection remain high. Our aim was to assess national trends in outcomes of type A aortic dissection repair and the impact of institutional thoracic aortic repair volume on clinical outcomes and resource use in the United States. Using the procedural and diagnostic codes of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, we identified type A aortic dissection repairs from the 2005 to 2014 database of the National Inpatient Sample. Hospitals were classified into low-, medium- and high-volume tertiles based on annual incidence of thoracic aortic operations. Patient demographics and hospital characteristics, as well as outcomes including mortality, cost, and duration of stay, were evaluated using parametric tests for trends and the volume-outcome relationship. We used a multivariable-adjusted logistic regression model to identify factors associated with mortality. An estimated 25,231 patients received type A aortic dissection repair with an increasing temporal trend in volume and concomitant decrease in mortality. When stratified by hospital volume, 10,115 (40.1%), 8,194 (32.4%), and 6,920 (27.4%) underwent type A aortic dissection at low-volume, medium-volume, and high-volume, respectively. The unadjusted mortality rate in high-volume was the least (21.5% vs 16.8% vs 11.6% for low-volume, medium-volume, and high-volume, respectively; P < .001). Multivariable analysis revealed older age, lesser household incomes and comorbidities, including congestive heart failure (adjusted odds ratio 1.44; P < .001) and coagulopathy (adjusted odds ratio 1.33; P = .01) as statistically significant predictors of mortality; however, the risk-adjusted duration of stay (adjusted odds ratio 0.88; P = .06) was not different between low-volume and high-volume hospitals. After adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, type A aortic dissection repair at low-volume hospitals was associated with increased likelihood of mortality compared with high-volume hospitals (adjusted odds ratio 2.10; P < .001). Patients undergoing type A aortic dissection repair at low-volume hospitals had increased odds of all complications including stroke, and respiratory complications compared than those at high-volume hospitals (P = .02, P < .001, and P < .001, respectively). The volume of open surgical repair for type A aortic dissection in the United States has increased over the past decade, while mortality has decreased. Hospital aortic operative volume is strongly associated with outcomes for type A aortic dissection repair. Protocols for expeditious transfer of patients to high volume aortic centers may serve to further decrease the acute mortality and complications of this procedure."

Recent studies brought about a paradigm shift with evidence to suggest benefits from early endovascular intervention to a high risk subgroup of acute uncomplicated TBAD patients. We aim to review the effects of aortic remodeling in Asian patients with TBAD with and without endovascular intervention, including maximal aortic diameter, true lumen diameter, and false lumen thrombosis. This is a single-center retrospective study of a prospective database. Patients who presented to our institution with acute TBAD from January 2008 to December 2015 (n = 44) were evaluated. Eighteen percent (8 patients) presented with complicated TBAD and underwent emergency thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) while the remaining 82% (36 patients) were treated with optimal medical therapy (OMT). Six patients under the conservative arm crossed over to elective TEVAR after 6 weeks because of interval radiological progression of disease. There was no significant difference in the baseline demographics of the TEVAR group and the OMT group. At 24 months, mean maximal aortic diameter difference was -7.7 mm and +1.9 mm (P = 0.077), mean true lumen diameter difference was +10.0 mm and +2.6 mm (P = 0.049), and false lumen thrombosis was 100% and 20% (P = 0.012) for TEVAR and OMT, respectively.

We analyzed the outcomes of all consecutive patients who underwent aortic valve repair and/ or aortic valve sparing root replacement till the end of 2019. We assessed mortality, freedom from reoperation, and freedom from at least moderate aortic valve regurgitation. A total of 504 patients underwent aortic valve repair and/or aortic valve sparing root replacement over 17 years, including 452 (89.7%) elective and 52 (10.3%) emergency surgeries for acute type A aortic dissections. Median (interquartile range) age was 59 (35-66) years, 72.4% were male. Median follow‑up time was 35 months. Estimated 5‑year survival was 83%, and 10‑year survival was 73%. In 452 patients after elective surgery, the estimated actuarial 5‑year and 10‑year survival was 86% and 75%, respectively. In patients after emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection, actuarial 5‑year survival was 62%, and 10‑year survival was 62%. Estimated 5- and 10‑year freedom from reoperation was 96% and 87%, respectively. The comparison of both subgroups did not reveal differences (P = 0.42). Freedom from at least moderate aortic valve regurgitation was confirmed in 86.6% of patients. Aortic valve repair is a durable and effective surgical procedure associated with low early and late mortality.

Bronchial artery coil embolization was first performed, which decreased the bronchial artery flow, stabilizing the hemodynamics. Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) was then performed, and the bleeding site at the surface of the lung was electrocauterized. Finally, the hemorrhage was controlled. This case suggests that the combination of coil embolization and VATS is an effective procedure."

    "abstract": "Although timely coronary intervention can result in markedly improved clinical outcomes of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), non-ST-elevation (NSTE)-ACS is sometimes difficult to accurately diagnose. A 52-year-old woman complained of acute chest pain with sudden onset. Both electrocardiography (ECG) and echocardiography showed normal results, and we urgently needed to make a differential diagnosis among critical illnesses such as acute coronary syndrome and nonischemic cardiovascular life-threatening diseases. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) without ECG synchronization showed evidence of neither aortic dissection nor pulmonary embolism, but regionally reduced contrast enhancement in the posterior myocardium, which were suggestive of myocardial ischemia. Emergency coronary angiography demonstrated severe stenosis of the left circumflex artery, and we achieved favorable revascularization with drug-eluting stent deployment. We diagnosed a patient with NSTE-ACS in whom contrast-enhanced CT without ECG synchronization was effective for visualization of reduced myocardial perfusion, suggesting ischemic heart disease."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous celiac artery dissection is a rare visceral artery dissection that typically presents with acute abdominal or flank pain. We describe a case of a 54-year old previously healthy male who presented to the Emergency Department with subacute back pain and was found to have a spontaneous celiac artery dissection. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Emergency medicine physicians frequently consider acute aortic dissection in patients presenting to the Emergency Department with acute chest, back, and/or upper abdominal pain. Less commonly thought of are variations of arterial dissection, including those involving the celiac artery. Given readily available diagnostic imaging modalities and therapeutic interventions, it remains important to consider visceral arterial dissection, and to recognize the varied clinical manifestations of this rare clinical entity."

    "title": "New Hybrid Prosthesis for Acute Type A Aortic Dissection.",
    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a surgical emergency with high rates of morbidity and mortality. The treatment of ATAAD is highly individualized and mainly depends on anatomical and technical factors. Great efforts to reduce the time to diagnosis and technological innovations have led to improved surgical results with a lower rate of dissection-related reoperations during long-term follow up. The aim of this article is to introduce a novel hybrid device for the treatment of DeBakey I acute aortic dissection. A non-covered hybrid stent from Ascyrus Medical (Boca Raton, FL, USA) aims to improve the current standard of care, without increasing technical complexity or device-related complications. The AMDS (Ascyrus Medical Dissection Stent) prolongs the hemiarch operation by only a few minutes, does not need endovascular skills to be deployed, and provides an anatomical and \"haemodynamic\" correction. The device is intended to reduce perfusion of the false lumen by sealing the distal anastomosis, and to restore distal perfusion of the true lumen. Obliteration of the false lumen at the distal anastomosis is likely to reduce aortic enlargement and the need for reoperations, mainly driven by a low-flow state and pressure reduction, which promote thrombosis. The AMDS provides a new concept to treat acute aortic dissection by moving the focus from resecting the dissected tissue to restoring adequate true-lumen flow and sealing the false lumen at the distal anastomosis. With a high rate of procedural success, AMDS represents a safe, reproducible and promising solution to treat DeBakey I aortic dissections."

    "abstract": "Aneurysmal ruptures are a life-threatening pathology, and while the aorta is the principal location, any aneurysmal rupture can be fatal. Most result from chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, and vasculitis. Nevertheless, a rupture can result in acute decompensation and must be recognized and addressed quickly to limit morbidity and mortality. The authors describe a case of a 66-year-old female who presented to the emergency department (ED) for abdominal pain and syncope. Even though imaging did not explicitly show the specific site of rupture of the hepatic artery, the positive Rapid Ultrasound for Shock and Hypotension (RUSH) exam and aortic dissection on computed tomography angiography along with her clinical picture (hypotension, abdominal pain, decreased capillary refill, grey skin) raised our suspicions for critical pathology. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a ruptured hepatic artery aneurysm. Her hospital course was complicated by ischemic necrosis of the gallbladder, spleen, and liver, requiring cholecystectomy, splenectomy, and partial hepatectomy, but she was discharged to rehabilitation and expected to make a recovery. This case displays the importance of using ultrasonography early to aid in expedited diagnosis and treatment as well as maintaining a high suspicion for vascular pathology in the setting of hemorrhagic shock."

    "abstract": "The study objective was to investigate the incidence and risk factors of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in patients undergoing emergency surgery for type A acute aortic dissection (TA-AAD) and evaluate the perioperative and long-term outcomes. From January 2014 to December 2018, 712 consecutive patients were enrolled in the study. These patients were divided into two groups according to whether or not needed postoperative CRRT: the CRRT group vs the control group. Univariate analysis and binary logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the risk factors of CRRT. To avoid the selection bias and confounders, baseline characteristics were matched for propensity scores. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to provide survival estimates at postoperative points in time. Before propensity score matching, univariate analysis showed that there were significant differences in age, preoperative hypertension, pericardial effusion, preoperative serum creatinine (sCr), intraoperative need for combined coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or mitral valve or tricuspid valve surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time, extracorporeal circulation assistant time, aortic cross-clamp time, drainage volume 24 h after surgery and ventilator time between two groups. All were higher in the CRRT group (P < 0.05). These risk factors were included in binary logistic regression. It showed that preoperative sCr and CPB time were independent risk factors for CRRT patients undergoing surgery for TA-AAD. And there were significant differences regarding 30-day mortality (P < 0.001) and long-term overall cumulative survival (P < 0.001) with up to a 6-year follow-up. After propensity scoring, 29 pairs (58 patients) were successfully matched. Among these patients, the analysis showed that CPB time was still significantly longer in the CRRT group (P = 0.004), and the 30-day mortality rate was also higher in this group (44.8% vs 10.3%; P = 0.003). CRRT after TA-AAD is common and worsened short- and long- term mortality. The preoperative sCr and CPB time are independent risk factors for postoperative CRRT patients. Shorten the CPB time as much as possible is recommended to reduce the risk of CRRT after the operation."

Methods A total of 156 patients underwent TAAA repair between January 2009 and December 2017. Renal failure was defined based on the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria. The patients were divided into ARF group and non-ARF group based on the presence/absence of postoperative ARF. The risk factors of ARF were analyzed by univariate analysis and multivariate logistic analysis. Results The subjects included 111 males and 45 females aged (40.4±10.9) years (range:19-65 years). The surgical reasons included aortic dissection (n=130,83.3%),aneurysm (n=22,14.1%),and pseudoaneurysm (n=4,2.6%). The degrees of repair included Crawford extent I in 6 patients (3.8%),extent Ⅱ in 128 patients (82.1%),extent Ⅲ in 20 patients (12.8%),and extent Ⅳ in 2 patients(1.3%). There were 3 patients presented with aortic rupture and 6 patients received emergent operations. Nine patients (5.8%) died within 30 days after surgery,and 8 patients (5.1%) suffered from permanent paraplegia. Thirty-six patients (23.1%) had ARF after surgery,and 18 of them needed dialysis.

Key risk factors include hypertension and aortopathy syndromes; however, possible ethnic associations and differences in presentation and outcomes are less well established. We compared characteristics and outcomes of type A aortic dissection surgery by ethnicity. Consecutive patients having type A aortic dissection surgery at Auckland City Hospital March 2003-March 2017 were divided into three ethnic groups: Māori, Pasifika and 'other', and analysed for characteristics, presentation and outcomes. Among 327 patients, 45 (14%) were Māori, 91 (28%) were Pasifika Islander and 191 (58%) were other ethnicities. Mean age was lowest for Māori 51+/-12 years, then Pasifika 56+/-12 and other ethnicities 63+/-13 (P<0.001). Māori and Pasifika ethnicities had higher body mass index, more hypertension, dyslipidaemia and smoking, but lower proportion presenting in critical pre-operative state. Operative mortality occurred in 5 (11%), 18 (20%) and 42 (22%) for Māori, Pasifika and other ethnicities (P=0.258). Pasifika had higher age-standardised operative mortality standardised mortality ratio 6.00, 95% confidence interval 3.67-9.30 than 'other' ethnicities, while Māori had higher age-standardised late mortality 5.71, 2.90-10.2 respectively, and the latter association persisted in multivariable analysis. Critical pre-operative state and malperfusion syndrome independently predicted operative mortality. Māori and Pasifika patients were younger and present less unwell with type A aortic dissection, but had higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. They had higher age-standardised late and operative mortality respectively, suggesting that aggressive management and risk factor control are critical for these patients."

    "abstract": "Due to the symptoms, patients with acute type A aortic dissection are first seen by the ambulance service and diagnosed at the emergency department. How often an aortic dissection occurs in an emergency department per year has been studied. The incidence in the emergency department may be used as a quality marker of differential diagnostics of acute chest pain. A multi-institutional retrospective study with the municipal Berlin hospital chain Vivantes and its Department of Pathology and the Charité - University Medicine Berlin was performed. From the Berlin Hospital Society, the annual numbers of publicly insured emergency patients were obtained. Between 2006 and 2016, 631 aortic dissections were identified. The total number of patients treated in the emergency departments (n = 12,790,577) was used to calculate the \"emergency department incidence.\" The autopsy data from six clinics allowed an estimate on how many acute type A aortic dissections remained undetected. Across all Berlin hospitals, the emergency department incidence of acute type A aortic dissection was 5.24 cases in 100,000 patients per year. In tertiary referral hospitals and, particularly, in university hospitals the respective incidences were markedly higher (6.7 and 12.4, respectively). Based on the autopsy results, about 50% of the acute type A aortic dissection may remain undetected, which would double the reported incidences. Among different hospital types the emergency department incidences of acute type A aortic dissection vary between 5.93/100,000 and 24.92/100,000.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of esmolol for heart rate control in patients with acute aortic dissection in the Emergency Department (ED). This was a retrospective, descriptive analysis of patients treated for type A or type B acute aortic dissection in the ED at an academic medical center. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving strict (≤60 bpm) or lenient (≤80 bpm) heart rate control within the first 60 min of therapy at the study site. The primary safety endpoint was the incidence of hypotension, defined as a systolic blood pressure of <90 mmHg or a mean arterial pressure of ≤60 mmHg. Of 266 patients screened, 40 patients met inclusion criteria. Thirty-three patients (82.5%) attained lenient rate control within the first 60 min of esmolol therapy. Eleven patients (27.5%) achieved a strict heart rate goal within the first 60 min of esmolol therapy. Five patients (12.5%) experienced an episode of hypotension during the first 3 h of esmolol therapy. In patients treated with esmolol infusion for acute aortic dissection, a lenient HR goal was achieved in most patients. In contrast, esmolol was not associated with attainment of strict HR control in most patients included in this sample. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the exact role of esmolol in acute aortic dissection in a larger patient population."

However, minimal research exists on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in survivors. We aimed to quantify the prevalence and describe characteristics of PTSD in patients following dissection. Methods and Results A total of 295 adult survivors of surgical dissection with an email on file were administered a cross-sectional online survey about their dissection experience; 137 returned questionnaires, and 129 (94%) responded to the 4-item Primary Care PTSD portion of the survey that was part of a larger lifestyle survey designed to study survivors of aortic dissection and surgery. In addition to the PTSD screening, it inquired about current sexual activity, exercise habits, and employment within the preceding 30 days. At a median of 6.8 years (quartile 1=2.6, quartile 3=8.9 years) after dissection, 23% of patients (30/129) screened positive for PTSD, with 44% (57/129) stating that within the past month they felt constantly on guard or watchful or were easily startled. Of those who screened positive and matched to their electronic medical record (n=27), only 2 (7.4%) had been tested and clinically diagnosed with PTSD. Patients who screened positive for PTSD were more likely to report limited current sexual activity than those who did not (odds ratio, 5.3; 95% CI, 1.9-15 [P=0.0006]). Conclusions PTSD is an important mental health consideration in aortic dissection survivors. Physicians should screen these patients for PTSD at follow-up visits to identify those who test positive and refer them for further testing and treatment, such as trauma-focused psychotherapy or medication."

The present study reviewed our outcomes of ascending aortic replacement and total arch replacement in patients with type A acute aortic dissection. A total of 253 patients with type A acute aortic dissection underwent a central repair operation. Our standard technique was ascending aortic replacement. Total arch replacement was performed only when entry existed in the major curvature of the aortic arch and the proximal descending aorta. A total of 169 patients (67%) underwent ascending aortic replacement, and 84 patients (33%) underwent total arch replacement. Hospital death due to initial surgery, dilatation of the distal aorta greater than 5 cm, new occurrence of aortic dissection, any distal aortic surgery, and aortic-related deaths were defined as distal aortic events. The mortality was 7.1% in the ascending aortic replacement group and 6.0% in the total arch replacement group. Postoperative computed tomography was performed in 162 patients in the ascending aortic replacement group. The false lumen of the residual aortic arch had thrombosed and healed in 94 patients (58%) and remained present in 68 patients (42%). The distal aortic event-free rate in the ascending aortic replacement group decreased from 74% at 5 years to 51% at 9 years, and the rate in the total arch replacement group was 83% at 5 to 9 years (P < .01). For the ascending aortic replacement group, more patients with a dissected arch had a distal aortic event compared with patients with a healed arch (P < .01). Total arch replacement was associated with fewer distal aortic events. We may expand the indications for total arch replacement in stable patients."

Emergency focused transthoracic echocardiography (ETTE) is commonly performed in the ED as part of the evaluation of a patient presenting with chest pain, but the suprasternal notch view (SSNV) is much less well-known and infrequently included in this assessment. We present a case of a 51-year-old previously healthy man who presented to the ED complaining of chest pain that had resolved prior to arrival, and a mild headache. His vital signs were notable for hypotension, but physical exam was unremarkable. Chest x-ray revealed a borderline widened mediastinum. A standard ETTE was within normal limits, but additional SSNV demonstrated a dissection flap in the aortic arch. The patient was taken to the operating room for surgical repair 75 minutes after the ED ultrasound was performed; the operation was successful, and the patient was discharged to home post-operatively with good outcome. Standard ETTE has limited ability to visualize the ascending aorta and aortic arch. Addition of SSNV allows visualization of these structures and may improve diagnostic accuracy and time to diagnosis of proximal aortic dissection.

We present the perioperative and follow-up outcomes and discuss the rate of complications. This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data from January 2017 to March 2019 of patients treated with TEVAR and ISLF of aortic arch branches at a large tertiary academic institution in an urban city in China. Preoperative, intraoperative, and follow-up clinical and radiographic data are analyzed and discussed. A total of 148 patients presented with symptomatic and acute or subacute TAAD, TBAD, thoracic aortic aneurysm, or penetrating aortic ulcer for a total of 183 arch vessels. There were 105 men and 43 women, 21 to 79 years of age (mean, 54.9 ± 12.9 years). Time from symptom onset to time of surgery was an average of 7 ± 3 days. Survivor follow-up duration ranged from 5 to 24 months (mean, 15 ± 5 months). Single-vessel fenestration was carried out in 124 cases, two-vessel fenestration in 13 cases, and three-vessel fenestration in 11 cases. There were four cases with technical failure to laser fenestration, with a technical success rate of 97.3%. Postoperatively, there were seven cases of endoleak (4.7%; one type IB distal from the left subclavian artery branch stent graft, three type IIIC at the fenestration site, and three type II), three retrograde dissections (2.0%), and five strokes (3.4%); death occurred in three patients with 30-day mortality of 2.9%, and two deaths occurred during follow-up for 3.4% mortality at an average 15 months of follow-up. There was no branch stent graft occlusion or spinal ischemia postoperatively or during follow-up. The distribution of arch diseases varied significantly according to the number of vessels that were laser fenestrated; TAAD was more likely to receive multivessel laser fenestrations, and TBAD was more likely to receive single-vessel fenestration (P < .001). The rate of complications was distributed differently between the three ISLF groups, with more complications occurring in multivessel fenestrations. However, a statistical weakening was observed when frequency of complications between the three groups was stratified by type of arch disease. The complication rate varied significantly between the different arch diseases, higher in TAAD than in TBAD (P = .008). ISLF during TEVAR for treatment of acute and subacute complex aortic arch diseases in the proximal aortic arch is safe and effective on the basis of these early to midterm follow-up data of a large cohort. However, care should be taken in intervening on TAAD using TEVAR with adjunctive multivessel laser fenestration. Continued investigation of TEVAR and adjunctive ISLF is needed to elucidate the long-term outcomes of this minimally invasive treatment for complex aortic arch disease in an urgent setting."

    "title": "Repair of Acute Type-A Aortic Dissection in the Present Era: Outcomes and Controversies.",
    "abstract": "Acute Type-A aortic dissection (AAAD) remains a surgical emergency with a relatively high operative mortality despite advances in medical and surgical management over the past three decades. In spite of the severity of disease, there is a paucity of studies reviewing key controversies surrounding AAAD repair and management. A systematic literature search was performed using Cochrane review and PubMed bibliography review. Abstracts were first reviewed for general pertinence and then articles were reviewed in full. Literature review indicates that use of moderate hypothermia and antegrade cerebral perfusion is a safe alternative to deep hypothermia. In hemodynamically stable patients, axillary cannulation may be substituted for femoral cannulation. With regard to the technical aspects of repair, preserving the aortic root whenever possible and performing the distal anastomosis with the open distal technique rather than with the clamp on is the preferred approach. In patients with a patent false lumen, close monitoring is indicated. As demonstrated by the literature, significant improvement of early and late mortality over the past years has occurred in patients presenting with AAAD. Repair of acute Type-A aortic dissection remains a challenge with high operative mortality; however, improvement of surgical techniques and management have resulted in improvement of early and late clinical outcomes."

    "abstract": "One of the most important points of the acute type A aortic dissection surgery is how to perform cannulation regarding cerebral protection concerns and the conditions of arterial structures as a pathophysiological consequence of the disease. In this study, femoral and axillary cannulation methods were compared in acute type A aortic dissection operations. The study retrospectively evaluated 52 patients who underwent emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection. Patients without malperfusion according to Penn Aa classification were chosen for preoperative standardization of the study groups. The femoral arterial cannulation group was group 1 (n=22) and the axillary arterial cannulation group was group 2 (n=30). The groups were compared in terms of perioperative and postoperative results. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of preoperative data. In terms of postoperative parameters, especially early mortality and new-onset cerebrovascular event, there was no statistically significant difference. Mortality rates in group 1 and group 2 were 13.6% (n=3) and 10% (n=3), respectively (P=0.685). Postoperative new-onset cerebral events ratio was found in 5 (22.7%) in the femoral cannulation group and 6 (20%) in the axillary cannulation group (P=0.812). Both femoral and axillary arterial cannulation methods can be safely performed in patients with acute type A aortic dissection, provided that cerebral protection strategies should be considered in the first place. The method to be performed may vary depending on the patient's current medical condition or the surgeon's preference."

    "abstract": "Acute chest pain caused by aortic dissection (AD) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the most serious medical emergencies and requires a very quick differential diagnosis to choose the best timing for treatment. AD and AMI are often manifested with similar symptoms, making it difficult to differentially diagnose these two conditions. After supracoronary aortic repair for type A AD, small intimal flap could remain in the anastomosis area. Aortic intramural hematoma could extend to the coronary ostia causing an extrinsic compression. Intravascular ultrasound is a safe and effective methodology to distinguish an atherosclerotic plaque from an extrinsic compression. We present the case of a 68-year-old man, with a recent surgical correction of a type A AD, referred to our emergency department for an acute coronary syndrome."

    "abstract": "Readmissions after aortic dissection (AD) admission are not well described. Using state-based administrative claims data, we sought to define readmission rates after AD and to identify factors associated with them. State Inpatient Databases for Florida (2007-2012) and New York (2008-2012) were queried for AD index admissions. Admissions were stratified by initial treatment strategy: type A open surgery repair (TAOR), type B open surgery repair (TBOR), thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), or medical management (MM). All-cause readmission rates were calculated at 30 days, 90 days, and 2 years. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with readmission at each time point for all type A admissions (TAOR) or type B admissions (TBOR, TEVAR, MM). We identified 4670 patients with an AD index admission. Treatment was with TAOR in 1031 (22%), TBOR in 761 (16%), TEVAR in 412 (9%), and MM in 2466 (53%). Patients were predominantly male (59.4%) and white (61.9%), with a median age of 66 years. Overall mortality during AD index admission was 14.8% (TAOR, 15.8%; TBOR, 17.1%; TEVAR, 9.0%; MM, 14.7%; P = .002 across all groups). All-cause readmission rates were similar across treatment groups at 30 days (9.6%-11%; P = .56), 90 days (15.2%-20%; P = .26), and 2 years (49.2%-54.4%; P = .15). Higher income quartile (vs lowest) was associated with lower odds of early readmission (at 30 days and 90 days) after type B admissions but not after type A admissions. At 2 years, self-pay (vs Medicare) was associated with lower odds of readmission in both type A and type B admissions, whereas higher comorbidity count and black race (vs white) were associated with higher odds of readmission. TEVAR (vs MM) was also associated with higher odds of readmission. Cardiovascular disease was the most common cause for readmission at all time points. Emergency department readmission counts were highest after MM admissions, and ambulatory surgical admissions were highest after TBOR. Both TEVAR and MM initial costs were lower than TAOR and TBOR costs, but at 2 years, costs remained significantly lower only for MM. In-state 30-day, 90-day, and 2-year readmission rates after AD were not associated with initial treatment type. Two-year readmissions are common. Strategies to target socioeconomic, race, and geographic factors may reduce variations in readmission patterns after AD admission."

    "title": "Systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies on endovascular repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms with the t-Branch off-the-shelf multibranched endograft.",
    "abstract": "Endovascular treatment of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms is becoming increasingly popular in clinical practice, mainly because of its reduced perioperative mortality and morbidity. However, the custom-made stent graft platform that companies offer requires detailed preoperative planning and production time that can take up to 12 weeks. This may delay surgery in elective patients and is not an option for urgent or emergent cases. To surpass this limitation, the t-Branch (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) was launched in 2012 in Europe as the first off-the-shelf standardized multibranched endograft for the endovascular treatment of thoracoabdominal aneurysms. Our aim was to systematically evaluate all published experience with this commercially available off-the-shelf thoracoabdominal stent graft. We performed a systematic inquiry of the medical databases to identify all published studies that reported on the outcomes of patients treated with the t-Branch stent graft and then conducted a qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis of the results. The main end points studied were technical success, mortality, major stroke, spinal cord ischemia, primary branch patency, and renal insufficiency during the first 30 days along with midterm mortality and reintervention rate. We estimated pooled proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We identified seven retrospective studies published between 2014 and 2018, with a total of 197 patients (mean age, 72.3 ± 7 years; 70% male). Among 165 patients, 45% were symptomatic and 19% were treated for a ruptured aortic aneurysm. In 197 patients, pooled technical success was 92.75% (95% CI, 83.9%-98.7%), and in 10% of the cases, an early endoleak was detected (95% CI, 0%-43.7%). Early mortality was 5.8% (95% CI, 2.5%-10%), and major stroke was observed in 4% of the patients (95% CI, 0.96%-8.40%). The rate of spinal cord ischemia was 12.2% (95% CI, 4.1%-23.2%), with the rate of permanent paraplegia at 1.3% (95% CI, 0%-8.7%). Acute renal failure was 18.7% (95% CI, 9.1%-30.4%), whereas primary branch patency was calculated at 98.2% (95% CI, 96.7%-99.2%). Mean follow-up was 15 ± 7 months. During this time, midterm mortality (after 30 days) was 6.9% (95% CI, 2.44%-12.8%) and pooled reintervention rate was 5.7% (95% CI, 1.70%-11.4%). This pooled analysis indicated good technical success rate after t-Branch endograft implantation, with acceptable mortality and neurologic complications despite a high rate of urgent procedures. Thoracoabdominal endovascular repair with the t-Branch endograft is a feasible and safe therapeutic option for elective and urgent patients."

Inpatient and outpatient records were retrospectively reviewed. Of the 81 patients with type A intramural haematoma and acute aortic dissection with the thrombosed false lumen of the ascending aorta between April 2011 and April 2019, a watch-and-wait strategy was selected in 46 patients. The mean age of the patients was 68 years, and 22 (48%) patients were female. Ten patients underwent emergency pericardial drainage for cardiac tamponade at the time of presentation and 8 patients underwent aortic repair during hospitalization for new ulcer-like projection, re-dissection or rupture. In-hospital mortality occurred in 2 (4%) patients. During follow-up, survival at 1 and 2 years was 95% and 92%, respectively. There was no significant difference in survival or aortic events between patients in whom the watch-and-wait strategy and emergency surgical treatment were indicated.

    "abstract": "Aortoesophageal fistulas are uncommon, dreadful vascular events, most frequently found in the setting of thoracic aorta aneurysms. Patients usually present with thoracic pain, dysphagia and sentinel hematemesis - the Chiari triad - followed by life threatening hematemesis. Emergent open surgery with debridement of necrotic tissue and in situ aortic graft repair is currently the best strategy. However, in patients which cannot withstand surgery, endovascular repair is currently gaining acceptance as a palliative treatment or as a bridge to surgery. We present a case of a 55-year-old female with a past of heavy alcohol abuse and a previously unknown massive aortic aneurysm, who presented to the emergency department complai- ning of acute dysphagia and epigastric pain. An abdominal ultrasound revealed left pleural effusion and suspected clots in the pleural space. A thoracic CTA was promptly done, where a spontaneous ruptured aortic aneurysm with aortoesophageal fistula was discovered. The team, fearing open surgery due to poor cardiac function, opted for a thoracic endovascular aortic repair. The aortoesophageal fistula dissected the esophageal wall in all of its thickness without rupture into the lumen. This was complicated with esophageal ischemia, aneurysmal sac infection and mediastinitis. Because the patient was in shock, in order to help control the infection, an esophageal prosthesis was placed, followed by proximal esophagostomy, distal esophageal closure and gastrostomy. Six months after initial presentation, the patient died at the emergency room, shortly after reentering with massive hematemesis and hypovolemic shock of undetermined origin."

Emergency total aortic arch replacement with a frozen elephant trunk was performed. Progressive intraoperative acidosis was observed. Immediate postoperative enhanced computed tomography showed that the distal end of the frozen elephant trunk was deployed into the false lumen through the initial tear at the proximal descending aorta. We performed emergency thoracic endovascular aortic repair through a fenestration made into the intimal flap using an Outback LTD re-entry device.

We report estimated incidence, clinical manifestations, treatment and outcomes of patients with an acute aortic dissection in a code stroke cohort from a comprehensive stroke centre. We used data from a single-centre prospective registry of consecutive adult patients who presented to the emergency department between 2015 and 2018 with neurological deficits suggestive of an acute stroke ('code stroke'). All patients routinely underwent non-contrast computed tomography of the brain and computed tomography-angiography of the aortic arch, cervical and intracranial arteries. Of 2874 code stroke patients, 1563 (54.4%) had acute ischaemia (ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack). Fifteen patients (0.5% of code stroke patients and 0.8% of patients with acute ischaemia) had an acute aortic dissection (all Stanford classification type A). Discerning clinical manifestations were decreased consciousness in 11/15 (73%), pain in 8/15 (53%) and low systolic blood pressure (mean 106 mmHg, SD30). Acute aortic dissection was an incidental finding during computed tomography-angiography in 4/15 (27%). Two out of 15 patients (13%) received intravenous thrombolysis, 9/15 (60%) underwent aortic surgery and 10/15 (67%) died. Of those who survived, 3/5 (60%) had a good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0-2). In our comprehensive stroke centre, about 1/200 code stroke patients and 1/125 patients with acute ischaemia had an acute aortic dissection. Multicentre studies are necessary to acquire a more reliable estimate of the incidence of acute aortic dissection in the code stroke population. Given the ramifications of missing this diagnosis, imaging of the entire aortic arch is important in these patients."

Initially, she was comatose and in a state of shock. The echocardiographic findings suggested cardiac tamponade by hematoma. Computed tomography also showed tamponade without aortic dissection. After imaging, she went into cardiac arrest, was returned to the ER, and tracheal intubation and left thoracotomy for pericardiotomy were performed. A return of spontaneous circulation was obtained by following this procedure. Bleeding from a rupture of the left cardiac free wall was confirmed, and the rupture was closed with TachoSil®. After closing the thoracotomy, electrocardiography revealed ST elevation in the precordial leads. Subsequently, placement of an indwelling intra-aortic balloon pump and coronary angiography (CAG) were performed. CAG showed an occlusion of the anterior interventricular branch and circumflex branch of the left coronary artery. She underwent conservative therapy in a coronary care unit. Finally, after obtaining hemodynamic stability and baseline mental status, she was transferred to another medical facility. We herein report a rare case involving the successful treatment of cardiac tamponade due to rupture of the heart performing an open-chest pericardiotomy and additionally discuss the key points for obtaining a favorable outcome."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection requires immediate surgical treatment, but the correct diagnosis is often delayed. This study aimed to analyse how initial misdiagnosis affected the time intervals before surgical treatment, symptoms associated with correct or incorrect initial diagnosis and the potential of the Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score to improve the sensitivity of initial diagnosis. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 350 patients with acute type A aortic dissection. Patients were divided into two groups: initial misdiagnosis (group 0) and correct initial diagnosis of acute type A aortic dissection (group 1). Symptoms were analysed as predictors for the correct or incorrect initial diagnosis by multivariate analysis. Based on these findings, the Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score was calculated retrospectively; a result ⩾2 was defined as a positive score. The early suspicion of aortic dissection significantly shortened the median time from pain to surgical correction from 8.6 h in patients with an initial misdiagnosis to 5.5 h in patients with the correct initial diagnosis (p<0.001). Of all acute type A aortic dissection patients, 49% had a positive Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score. Of all initial misdiagnosed patients, 41% had a positive score (⩾2). The presence of lumbar pain (p<0.001), any paresis (p=0.037) and sweating (p=0.042) was more likely to lead to the correct initial diagnosis. An early consideration of acute aortic dissection may reduce the delay of surgical care. The suggested Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score may be a useful tool to improve the preclinical assessment."

    "abstract": "Pregnancy can lead to complications in women with heart disease, and these complications can be life threatening. Understanding serious complications and how they can be prevented is important. The primary objectives were to determine the incidence of serious cardiac events (SCEs) in pregnant women with heart disease, whether they were preventable, and their impact on fetal and neonatal outcomes. Serious obstetric events were also examined. A prospectively assembled cohort of 1,315 pregnancies in women with heart disease was studied. SCEs included cardiac death or arrest, ventricular arrhythmias, congestive heart failure or arrhythmias requiring admission to an intensive care unit, myocardial infarction, stroke, aortic dissection, valve thrombosis, endocarditis, and urgent cardiac intervention. The Harvard Medical Study criteria were used to adjudicate preventability. Overall, 3.6% of pregnancies (47 of 1,315) were complicated by SCEs. The most frequent SCEs were cardiac death or arrest, heart failure, arrhythmias, and urgent interventions. Most SCEs (66%) occurred in the antepartum period. Almost one-half of SCEs (49%) were preventable; the majority of preventable SCEs (74%) were secondary to provider management factors. Adverse fetal and neonatal events were more common in pregnancies with SCEs compared with those without cardiac events (62% vs. 29%; p < 0.001). Serious obstetric events were less common (1.7%) and were primarily due to pre-eclampsia with severe features. Pregnant women with heart disease are at risk for serious cardiac complications, and approximately one-half of all SCEs are preventable. Strategies to prevent serious cardiac complications in this high-risk cohort of women need to be developed."

    "abstract": "Acute type B aortic dissection is a life-threatening medical emergency, and hypertension is believed to be an important predictor of aortic dissection; the impact of blood pressure variability on the onset and development of aortic dissection has attracted increasing attention. A total of 120 acute type B aortic dissection patients and 57 hypertensive patients without aortic dissection were consecutively enrolled and retrospectively reviewed between January 2013 and November 2015. There were 60 acute type B aortic dissection patients in both high and low blood pressure variability groups. Blood pressure variability showed higher diagnostic value than hypertension in aortic dissection, and the best threshold of blood pressure variability is 5.71 mmHg. By performing multivariable logistic regression, we found that the history of hypertension was likely to be a risk factor of blood pressure variability (95% CI: 1.155-6.422, P = 0.022). Nine patients from high blood pressure variability group and two from low blood pressure variability group (χ2 = 4.90, P = 0.027) received emergency surgery within 24 hours after admission. The presence of multiple tears (>2, 55.0% vs. 45.0%, P = 0.001), configuration of the false lumen (spiral false lumen) (50.0% vs. 21.7%, P = 0.001), the diameter of the false lumen (49.6 ± 15.0 mm vs. 37.6 ± 10.8 mm, P < 0.001), the false/true lumen ratio (1.53 ± 1.02 vs. 0.929 ± 0.733, P < 0.001), and the number of visceral arteries involved (1.75 ± 0.942 vs. 0.800 ± 0.927, P < 0.001) showed significant differences between high and low blood pressure variability groups. Nine (30%) patients from the high blood pressure variability group showed a maximum diameter of false lumen over 60 mm, while none was found in the low blood pressure variability group. High blood pressure variability, the presence of multiple tears (>2), the configuration of false lumen, the diameter of the false lumen, false/true lumen ratio, and the number of visceral arteries involved were independent risk factors for acute type B aortic dissection."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection is the most common life-threatening disorder affecting the aorta, and can mimic other disease processes. We describe an unusual presentation of a critically ill patient with initial hematospermia diagnosed with a type A acute aortic dissection. A 68 year old man presented to a community ED after masturbation and report of blood in his ejaculate, followed by rapid development of severe low back, chest and hip pain with shock. ECG showed evidence of ST segment elevation, but suspicion remained high for thoracic or abdominal aortic catastrophe. Bedside ultrasound demonstrated no pericardial effusion, a severely hypokinetic myocardium and a question of fluid in the left perinephric space. Attempts were made to resuscitate the patient, and an ED chest/abdomen/pelvis CT showed a type A acute thoracic aortic dissection. Unfortunately, the patient remained profoundly unstable, with multiple arrests. He was transferred to a tertiary care facility, but expired shortly after arrival. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: An emergency physician needs to be aware of the myriad of presentations of acute aortic dissection. Although hematospermia was felt ultimately to be an incidental symptom, sexual activity may bring about a significant transient increase in blood pressure, which could contribute to sheer force causing aortic injury. Awareness of this trigger and a careful sensitive history may aid the clinician in early diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is a rare and emergent condition. Aortic dissection during pregnancy is not much known but it is quite lethal to both mother and infant. Earlier reports published show that clinicians conducted hysterectomies during cesarean section to avoid anticoagulant-induced uterine bleeding during the following aortic surgery. A woman (38, gravida 1, para 0) in the 37th gestational week suffered an acute, severe, sharp pain in the chest and back. She was diagnosed with Standford type A aortic dissection and suspected with Marfan syndrome. An emergency cesarean section was performed immediately to deliver the baby. Since the patient was on anticoagulants during aortic replacement, so Cook balloon was inserted into the uterus to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. This helped to maintain the uterus intact. Family genetic testing showed that the patient was a carrier of FBN1 mutation which was inherited from the patient's mother, and the newborn also carried the mutation. Hence the patient was concluded to be positive for Marfan syndrome. It is important that clinicians should pay attention to the possibility of aortic dissection in a pregnant woman with chest, abdominal or back pain. In this case study, we employed Cook balloon during cesarean section to avoid anticoagulant-induced uterine bleeding during the following aortic surgery."

Patients with venous thromboembolism, acute aortic dissection and thrombosis of the upper extremity showed a maximum positive predictive value of 85.2% at a D-dimer level of 7.8 mg/L (95% confidence interval (CI) 78.1 to 90.4). The maximum positive predictive value was lower in cancer patients with venous thromboembolism, acute aortic dissection and thrombosis of the upper extremity, reaching 68.9% at a D-dimer level of 7.5 mg/L (95% CI 57.4 to 78.4). The positive likelihood ratio was very consistent with the positive predictive value. Using a cut-off level of 0.5 mg/L, D-dimer showed a high sensitivity of at least 93%, but a very low specificity of nearly 0%. Conversely, an optimised cut-off value of 4.6 mg/L increased specificity to 95% for the detection of life-threatening venous thromboembolism, acute aortic dissection or thrombosis of the upper extremity at the costs of moderate sensitivities (58% for pulmonary embolism, 41% for deep vein thrombosis, 65% for pulmonary embolism with co-existent deep vein thrombosis, 50% for acute aortic dissection and 13% for thrombosis of the upper extremity). Using the same cut-off in cancer patients, higher values were observed for sensitivity at a specificity level of more than 95%. The area under the curve for the discrimination of venous thromboembolism/acute aortic dissection/thrombosis of the upper extremity from controls was significantly higher in cancer versus non-cancer patients (area under the curve 0.905 in cancer patients, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.92, vs. area under the curve 0.857 in non-cancer patients, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.88; P=0.0349). D-dimers are useful not only to rule out but also to rule in venous thromboembolism and acute aortic dissection with an at least moderate discriminatory ability, both in patients with and without cancer."

    "abstract": "After an emergent surgery for type A acute aortic syndrome, medical management is based on optimal blood pressure (BP) control. We assessed the prognostic significance of BP monitoring and its relationship with aortic morphology following type A acute aortic syndrome. The data of 120 patients who underwent BP monitoring after a type A acute aortic syndrome from January 2005 to June 2016 were retrospectively collected. The first CT angiogram performed after surgery was used for the morphological analysis. The population included 79 males, with an overall mean age of 60 ± 12 years. Seven patients (5.8%) died during a median follow-up of 5.5 years. The median delay between BP monitoring and discharge was 3 (1-5) months. The mean 24-hour BP of the cohort was 127/73 mm Hg ± 10/17. During follow-up, different parameters of BP monitoring were not associated with the risk of aortic events. However, the diameter of the false lumen of the descending thoracic aorta was the best predictor associated with the risk of new aortic events during follow-up, particularly for the threshold of 28 mm or more (P < .001; Hazard ratio 4.7[2.7-8.2]). The diameter of the false lumen was associated with night-time systolic BP (P = .025; r = .2), 24-hour pulse pressure (P = .002; r = .28), and night-time pulse pressure (P = .008; r = .24). The risk of new aortic events following type A acute aortic syndrome is associated with the size of the residual false lumen, but not directly with BP parameters. Night-time BP parameters are associated with the size of the residual false lumen."

From 2004 to 2008, 26 consecutive, nonselected patients (mean age at surgery: 67 ± 9 years) underwent a Bentall operation using a stentless Shelhigh valved conduit at our institution. Mean preoperative Logistic-EuroSCORE was 17.1 ± 12.9. The mean size of the aortic root was 53.2 ± 5 mm. The mean preoperative ejection fraction was 55 ± 7.4%. Three patients had a bicuspid valve. One patient with acute endocarditis and one patient with type A aortic dissection were operated on an emergency. Three patients (11.54%) had a previous cardiac operation. The Button-Bentall technique was used in all cases. Seven patients (26.92%) received an associated procedure. The mean size of the implanted prosthesis was 26.1 ± 2.2. Follow-up ranged between 6 and 174 months (mean 93.4 ± 59.1 months). Primary endpoints consisted of early and late mortality, freedom from acute endocarditis, freedom from structural valve deterioration, and freedom from valve-related-reoperation. Two patients died in hospital, while 10 patients died during follow-up time, of which three for cardiac causes (12.5%). Overall survival probability was 52.9% at 15 years. Freedom from acute endocarditis was 95.7% at 5 and 15 years. Freedom from severe aortic incompetence due to structural deterioration was 100% at 5 and 10 years, 90.9% at 15 years. The mean aortic gradient at follow-up was 11.4 ± 5 mm Hg. Freedom from valve-related reoperation was 100% at 5 and 10 years, 90.9% at 15 years. In our experience, Bentall's operation using the Shelhigh NR-2000 stentless bio-conduit provided satisfactory early and long-term results. However, our findings are not consistent with unfavorable long-term outcomes following the implantation of this device reported by other authors."

    "abstract": "Endovascular techniques have become an essential tool for treatment of thoracic aortic pathology. The objective of this study was to analyze indications and results of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in vascular surgery units, through a retrospective and multicentric national registry called Regis-TEVAR. From 2012 to 2016, a total of 287 patients from 11 vascular surgery units, treated urgently and electively, were recruited consecutively. The primary variables analyzed are mortality, survival, and reintervention rate. The following indications for TEVAR were also analyzed: aortic dissections, thoracic aneurysms, traumatisms, and intramural hematomas or penetrating ulcers, as well as results and postoperative complications in accordance with each indication. Of the 287 TEVAR performed (239 men, mean age 64.1 ± 14.1 years), 155 were because of aortic aneurysm (54%), 90 because of type B aortic dissection (31.4%), 36 because of traumatic aortic rupture (12.5%), and 6 because of penetrating ulcers or intramural hematomas (2.1%). Overall mortality at 30 days was 11.5% (18.5% in urgent and 5.3% in elective), being higher in dissections (13.3%). The median actuarial survival was 73% at 4 years. The stroke rate was 3.1%, and the rate of spinal cord ischemia was 4.9%. Aortic reoperations were necessary in 23 patients (8.1%). This registry provides complete and reliable information on real clinical practice of TEVAR in Spain, with results similar to international series of open surgery. In accordance with these data, TEVAR can be performed with acceptable morbidity and mortality and with low rates of postoperative complications."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic syndrome and in particular aortic dissection (AAD) persists as a cause of significant morbidity and mortality despite improvements in surgical management. This clinical review aims to explore the risks of misdiagnosis, outcomes associated with misdiagnosis and evaluate current diagnostic methods for reducing its incidence.Due to the nature of the pathology, misdiagnosing the condition and delaying management can dramatically worsen patient outcomes. Several diagnostic challenges exist, including low prevalence, rapidly propagating pathology, non-discrete symptomatology, non-specific signs, analogy with other acute conditions and lack of management infrastructure. A similarity to acute coronary syndromes is a specific concern and risks patient maltreatment. AAD with malperfusion syndromes are both a cause of misdiagnosis and marker of disease complication, requiring specifically tailored management plans from the emergency setting.Despite improvements in diagnostic measures, including imaging modalities and biomarkers, misdiagnosis of AAD remains commonplace and current guidelines are relatively limited in preventing its occurrence. This paper recommends the early use of AAD risk scoring, focused echocardiography and most importantly, fast-tracking patients to cross-sectional imaging where the suspicion of AAD is high. This has the potential to improve the diagnostic process for AAD and limit the risk of misdiagnosis. However, our understanding remains limited by the lack of large patient datasets and an adequately audited processes of emergency department practice."

    "abstract": "Purpose: To compare characteristics of acute, subacute, and chronic type B aortic dissection and their influence on long-term results of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). Materials and Methods: In a single-center, retrospective cohort study, 314 patients (median age 52 years; 244 men) with acute (n=165), subacute (n=115), or chronic (n=34) type B aortic dissection underwent TEVAR between January 2009 and December 2013. Patient demographics, risk factors, and imaging characteristics were compared among the groups. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to identify any factors influencing survival. Results: The acute and subacute patients exhibited more complications at presentation than chronic patients. However, the chronic patients exhibited more aneurysmal dilatation (p<0.001) and true lumen collapse (p<0.001). Over a mean follow-up of 68.1±22.9 months (range 2-108), subacute patients showed a lower reintervention rate (3.6% vs 12.1% vs 12.1%, p=0.045), a lower major complication rate (14.4% vs 33.1% vs 27.3%, p=0.002), and better cumulative overall survival (p=0.03) than the acute and chronic groups, respectively. Furthermore, acute patients developed more stent-graft-induced distal erosion (p=0.017) and retrograde type A dissection (RTAD) (p=0.036), whereas chronic patients had less aortic remodeling in the stented segment (p<0.001), distal thoracic aorta (p<0.001), and abdominal aorta (p=0.047). Finally, multivariable analysis demonstrated age >52 years, visceral malperfusion, and RTAD as independent factors influencing overall survival; aneurysmal dilatation, rupture/impending rupture, and RTAD were independent factors influencing aorta-specific survival. Conclusion: Acute and subacute patients had increased risks of rupture and complications at presentation, whereas chronic patients had increased risks for aneurysmal dilatation. From a long-term perspective, the subacute phase might be an optimal time for TEVAR in cases of type B aortic dissection that do not need emergent interventions. The risk factors influencing survival should be identified, carefully managed, and possibly prevented."

    "abstract": "Patients with acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) present with heterogeneous involvement of the aortic root complex. Despite this variation, the aortic root can usually be preserved the majority of the time by Teflon (WL Gore, Newark, DE) inlay patch reconstruction of the dissected sinuses of Valsalva (SOV). In this study, we report the long term anatomic, functional, and clinical outcomes associated with the preserved SOV after surgery for ATAAD. From 2002-2017, of 776 emergency ATAAD operations at a single institution, 558 (71.9%) underwent valve resuspension with SOV preservation. Echocardiography reports were reviewed to obtain postoperative SOV dimensions. Cumulative incidence of SOV dilation ≥ 4 5mm was calculated using the Fine-Gray method with death as a competing risk. Repeated-measures linear mixed effects model was used to determine risk factors for SOV growth over time. During the follow-up period, 62 of 558 (11.1%) patients developed SOV diameter ≥ 45 mm. Cumulative incidence of SOV dilation ≥ 45 mm at 1, 5, and 10 years was 5.5%, 12.4%, and 18.9% respectively. In a multivariable Cox regression model, preoperative SOV diameter ≥ 45 mm was associated with a hazard ratio of 14.11 (95% confidence interval 7.03-31.62) for postoperative SOV dilation ≥ 45 mm. In a repeated-measures linear mixed effects model, preoperative and discharge SOV diameter were significant predictors of SOV dilation. Postoperative time course was also identified as significant indicating growth over time. The preserved sinuses of Valsalva after surgery for ATAAD may be prone to progressive dilatation over time. Closer echocardiographic surveillance may be warranted in these patients."

We previously reported excellent outcomes using percutaneous pericardial drainage with controlled volumes of aspirated pericardial effusion (controlled pericardial drainage [CPD]) to stabilize patients with critical cardiac tamponade. This study evaluates the early and late outcomes using this approach. Between September 2003 and July 2018, 308 patients with acute aortic dissection type A were treated surgically, including 76 patients who presented with cardiac tamponade on hospital arrival. Forty-nine patients who did not respond to intravenous volume resuscitation underwent CPD in the emergency room, including 14 patients (28.6%) who presented with cardiopulmonary arrest. After CPD 39 patients (79.6%) were transferred to the operating room to undergo immediate aortic repair. The remaining 10 patients (20.4%) received medical treatment on arrival, followed by aortic repair within several days. In 49 patients the mean systolic blood pressure before CPD was 64.4 ± 10.3 mm Hg. Blood pressure rose significantly in all patients after CPD. The total volume of aspirated pericardial effusion was 46.8 ± 56.2 mL, and 30 of 49 patients (61%) required only 30 mL or less of aspiration to improve their blood pressure. All patients underwent successful aortic repair. Early hospital mortality was 16%. However there was no mortality related to CPD. The mean follow-up period was 52.9 ± 54.3 months. The cumulative survival rate was 63.4% after 5 years. CPD for critical cardiac tamponade with acute type A aortic dissection produced satisfactory early and late outcomes."

We report probably the most effective treatment of a type A AAD with acute cerebral infarction leading to coma. A 43-year-old man presented with acute hemiplegia and unconsciousness. He was diagnosed as acute cerebral infarction. After an ineffective emergency intravenous thrombolysis, a Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) examination revealed the severe cerebral artery occlusion, and the TICI 3 level was achieved by stent implantation in the left common carotid artery with significant neurological recovery. A type A AAD was found at the 1 month follow-up ultrasound examination and a further thoracic surgery was performed successfully. Carotid ultrasound is helpful for the diagnosis of AAD from acute cerebral infarction. Carotid artery stenting followed by thoracic surgery is effective in this kind of emergency situations. Further studies are needed to determine the exact indications."

From April 2013 to January 2017, 15 consecutive patients with TBAD associated with retrograde type A IMH who underwent TEVAR were reviewed retrospectively. There was no cardiac tamponade, aortic regurgitation, involvement of coronary artery, or sign of cerebral ischemia in these patients. Enhanced CT was used in 4 patients to diagnose malperfusion of abdominal visceral arteries or lower extremity artery and underwent emergent TEVAR. For the remaining 11 patients, repeated enhanced CT after initial medical treatment within 24 hours from onset of pain showed expansion of IMH in 8 patients or presence of periaortic hematoma in 3 patients. Delayed TEVAR was scheduled for these cases. Successful deployment of the stent graft was achieved in all patients. There were no severe postoperative complications, such as retrograde type A aortic dissection or aortic rupture. Sudden death occurred in 1 patient 3 months after the procedure. Thrombosis of the false lumen, shrinkage of the diameter of the aorta, and complete absorption of the IMH were observed in the remaining patients at a mean follow-up of 19.8 months ± 6.57. TEVAR for treatment of TBAD with retrograde type A IMH is feasible and effective. It represents a treatment option for patients with TBAD associated with type A IMH with a proximal entry tear located in the descending aorta."

This retrospective study aimed to clarify the short-term and mid-term outcomes in patients who underwent surgical rescues for hemopericardium complicated by ATAAD. Between January 2007 and March 2019, 586 consecutive patients underwent ATAAD repair at our institution. According to preoperative computed tomography, hemopericardium was found in 191 patients (32.6%), 150 were stabilized with medical treatment, and 41 underwent surgical rescues for critical hemodynamics. The 41 patients were classified into groups according to their rescue procedures: emergent subxiphoid pericardiotomy (E-SXP group, n = 26, 63.4%) or emergent cardiopulmonary bypass (E-CPB group, n = 15, 36.6%). Clinical features, surgical information, postoperative complications, and 3-year survival were analyzed and compared. Demographics, comorbidities and aortic repair procedures were generally homogenous between the two groups, except for sex. The average systolic blood pressure was 62.4 ± 13.3 mmHg and 67.1 ± 13.1 mmHg in the E-SXP and E-CPB groups, respectively. A total of 29.3% of patients underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) before surgical rescues. The in-hospital mortality was similar (30.8% versus 33.3%, P = 0.865) in the two groups. Multivariate analysis revealed that preoperative CPR was an in-hospital predictor of mortality. For patients who survived to discharge, 3-year cumulative survival rates were 87.8% ± 8.1% and 60.0% ± 19.7% in the E-SXP and E-CPB groups, respectively (P = 0.170). Patients who underwent surgical rescues for ATAAD-complicated hemopericardium are at a high risk of in-hospital mortality.

The levels of plasma IL-6, TNF-α, CRP, MMP-9 and endotoxins at admission and at 6 h, 12 h and 24 h after admission (T0, T1, T2 and T3) were measured, and the correlations of inflammatory cytokines with endotoxins were analyzed. At T1, T2 and T3, the levels of inflammatory cytokines and endotoxins were increased. The levels of plasma IL-6, TNF-α, CRP, MMP-9 and endotoxins in the death group were significantly higher than those in the survival group at each time point (p < 0.05 in all comparisons). Neutrophil and platelet counts in the death group were higher than those in the survival group (p < 0.05). Correlation analyses indicated that the levels of IL-6, TNF-α, CRP and MMP-9 were positively correlated with the level of endotoxin. Patients with AAD are often accompanied by systemic inflammatory responses, with inflammation-related cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, CRP and MMP-9) and endotoxins levels significantly elevated. Combined monitoring of dynamic changes in inflammatory cytokines and endotoxins, as well as early interventions, has important clinical implications for evaluating the prognosis of AAD and reducing mortality."

The primary entry tear was located at the level of the tenth thoracic vertebra above the aneurysm. Emergency thoracic endovascular aortic repair was performed to cover the entry tear and to regain perfusion of the lower body. Efforts to perform retrograde insertion of a guidewire from the femoral arteries to pass the occluded abdominal aorta were unsuccessful.

Twenty-one percent had PAU of the arch, 62% of the thoracic aorta, and 17% of the abdominal aorta. Conservative and surgical groups were analyzed separately. Primary outcomes included mortality, PAU progression, and interventional complications. Initially, 67% of patients (29/43) were managed conservatively; they had significantly smaller PAU neck widths (P = .04), PAU depths (P = .004), and lower rates of associated aneurysmal change (P = .004) compared with those initially requiring surgery. Four patients (4/29) initially managed conservatively eventually required surgical management at a mean time interval of 49.75 months (range, 9.03-104.33 months) primarily owing to aneurysmal degeneration. Initially, 33% of patients (14/43) underwent surgical management; 7 of the 14 procedures were urgent. Of the 18 patients, 17 eventually managed with surgical intervention had an endovascular repair; 2 of the 17 endovascular cases involved supra-aortic debranching, six used scalloped, fenestrated, or chimney stents. The overall long-term mortality was 30% (mean follow-up, 48 months; range, 0-136 months) with no significant difference between the conservatively and surgically managed groups (P = .98). No aortic-related deaths were documented during follow-up in those managed conservatively. There was no in-hospital mortality after surgical repair. Of these 18 patients, two required reintervention within 30 days for type I or III endoleaks. Among the 18 patients, seven died during follow-up (mean survival, 90.24 months; range, 66.48-113.88) with 1 of the 18 having a confirmed aortic-related death. Isolated, asymptomatic, small PAUs may be safely managed conservatively with regular surveillance.

Multiple aortic procedures were also more likely (P < .05) in patients who developed de novo distal dissection (14% vs 0%), had prior dissection (47% vs 18%), or unknown MFS at the time of the initial procedure (27% vs 63%). Multivariable analysis identified prior dissection as an independent predictor of need for emergent surgery (odds ratio, 13.20; 95% confidence interval, 4.64-37.30; P < .05), as well as additional aortic surgery (odds ratio, 4.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.87-10.50; P < .05). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed similar 10-year survival with or without aortic interventions (82% with vs 89% without; P = .08). Late survival was decreased in patients undergoing emergent initial procedures (66% vs 89%; P < .01), as well as those undergoing multiple operations (74% vs 86%; P = .03). These data indicate that, in the modern era, the mode of presentation and need for multiple procedures have a detrimental impact on late survival. Additionally, the presence of acute or chronic dissection predicts the need for additional aortic procedures during follow-up."

    "abstract": "The aims of the present study were to describe the age-specific incidence and 30-day mortality of aortic dissection patients presenting to the EDs in New South Wales (NSW). This was a data linkage study involving emergency, inpatient and death registry administrative data from NSW. The present study found 273 instances of aortic dissection in NSW from July 2017 to July 2018. Calculated incidence was 3.47 per 100 000. Incidence increased exponentially with age. The 30-day mortality rate among this cohort was 35.53% (n = 97). Mortality was significantly associated with age and pre-existing comorbidity burden, but was not associated with gender, level of hospital or time of presentation. The present study found the incidence of aortic dissection within the NSW population to be 3.4 per 100 000. The incidence of aortic dissection in our population increased from 8.6 per 100 000 for people aged between 60 and 80 years to 32 per 100 000 for those aged over 80 years."

    "abstract": "Treatment of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms is one of the most difficult challenges of vascular surgery. Endovascular options for complex aneurysms in urgent situation are limited. Thoracoabdominal giant aortic aneurysms are especially rare phenomena, each of them requires patient-specific treatment. Staged-fashion reconstructions may offer lower rate, especially for spinal cord injury. In our case report, we present a male patient, who had a 19.2 cm maximum diameter modified Crawford type V thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm with contained rupture. The patient underwent an acute open repair and later a staged endovascular repair successfully. A 64-year-old male patient was admitted to our institution with complaints of chest and lower back pain in stable hemodynamic state. After evaluation, computer tomography angiography revealed a 19.2 cm maximum diameter thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm, compression signs and hemothorax. Based on the anatomy, the serious compression symptoms and hemothorax associated with the gigantic aneurysm, we decided to perform open aortic repair. To reduce risk of spinal cord ischemia, intraoperatively we chose finishing the full reconstruction in a staged fashion. First, we performed an open repair with a Dacron interpositum distally using an oblique patch involving the visceral orifices. Later we implanted a thoracic endograft. At one-year follow-up, the patient was symptom-free, with no sign of endoleak. Giant aortic aneurysms are rare conditions, especially in the thoracoabdominal region. In the presence of compression symptoms, hemothorax and unsuitable aneurysm anatomy, open repair should be done. Staged repair offers a less invasive approach decreasing the risk of spinal cord ischemia. Orv Hetil. 2020; 161(7): 269-274. Absztrakt: A thoracoabdominalis aortaaneurysmák kezelése az érsebészet egyik legnagyobb kihívása. Sürgős esetekben ezen komplex aneurysmák endovascularis ellátásának lehetőségei limitáltak. Az óriás méretű (10 cm-t meghaladó) thoracoabdominalis aortaaneurysma rendkívül ritka jelenség, ellátása mindig betegspecifikus, egyedi kezelést igényel. A tervezett kezelés alacsonyabb morbiditási aránnyal jár, különösen a gerincvelő-sérülés tekintetében. Esetünkben egy 19,2 cm maximális átmérőjű, Crawford V típusú thoracoabdominalis aortaaneurysma sikeres kezelését mutatjuk be. A férfi beteget először akutan, nyitottan operáltuk tartott ruptura miatt, majd később halasztott időpontban endovascularisan folytattuk ellátását. A 64 éves férfi beteget mellkasi és hasi panaszok miatt vettük fel intézetünkbe(1) stabil hemodinamikai paraméterekkel. Kontrasztanyagos CT-angiográfiás vizsgálat igazolta a 19,2 cm legnagyobb átmérőjű, többszörös thoracoabdominalis aortaaneurysmáját, kompressziós jelekkel, haemothoraxszal és az alsó szakasz tartott rupturájával. Az anatómia, az extrém méret, a kompressziós tünetek és a haemothorax miatt a nyitott műtéti megoldást választottuk, és intraoperatívan döntöttünk végül a kétszakaszos ellátás mellett. Első lépésben a rupturált szakasz ellátására egy aortoaorticus Dacron interpositumot implantáltunk úgy, hogy a visceralis szakaszt egy ferde ’patch’ segítségével rekonsruáltuk, majd a második lépésben végeztük el a mellkasi sztentgraft beültetését. Az egyéves kontrollon a beteg panaszmentes volt, ’endoleak’ nem ábrázolódott. Az óriás aortaaneurysmák ritka klinikai entitások, főleg a thoracoabdominalis régióban. A kompressziós tünetek, a haemothorax és a jelentős anatómiai változások miatt az endovascularis beavatkozás kivitelezhetősége erősen kérdéses. Ruptura esetén azonnali ellátásuk jelenleg szinte csak nyitottan végezhető. A többlépcsős beavatkozás csökkentheti a gerincvelő-károsodás veszélyét, ezért megfelelő anatómia esetén megfontolandó ennek a ritka betegségnek a kezelésében. Orv Hetil. 2020; 161(7): 269–274."

    "abstract": "Pre-emptive thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) improves late survival and limits progression of disease after type B aortic dissection, but the potential value of pre-emptive TEVAR has not been evaluated after type A dissection extending beyond the aortic arch (DeBakey type I). The purpose of this study was to compare disease progression and need for aortic intervention in survivors of acute, extended type A (ExTA) dissections after initial repair of the ascending aorta versus acute type B aortic dissections. Consecutive patients presenting with ExTA or type B dissections between 2011 and 2018 were studied. Forty-three patients with ExTA and 44 with type B dissections who survived to discharge and had follow-up imaging studies were included in the analysis. Study end points included progression of aortic disease (>5 mm growth or extension), need for intervention, and death. The groups were not different for age, sex, atherosclerotic risk factors, or extent of dissection distal to the left subclavian artery. Following emergent ascending aortic repair, five ExTA patients (12%) underwent TEVAR within 4 months after discharge. Despite optimal medical treatment, 29 type B patients (66%) underwent early or late TEVAR (P < .001). During a mean follow-up of 38 ± 30 months, 38 ExTA patients (88%) did not require intervention-23 (53%) of whom showed no disease progression. In comparison, during a mean follow-up of 18 ± 6 months, 14 type B patients (32%) did not require intervention-nine (20%) of whom showed no disease progression (P = .003). There was one aortic-related late death in the ExTA group and two in the type B group. Compared with ExTA patients, type B patients had significantly worse intervention-free survival and intervention/growth-free survival (log rank, P < .001). In contrast with type B dissections, these midterm results demonstrate that one-half of ExTA aortic dissections show no disease progression in the thoracic or abdominal aorta, and few require additional interventions. After initial repair of the ascending aorta, pre-emptive TEVAR does not seem to be justified in patients with acute, ExTA dissections."

We performed a retrospective single-center analysis of 2156 ED patients who presented with acute chest pain with a negative initial troponin and electrocardiogram for myocardial injury. Patient cohorts matched by patient characteristics who had undergone TRO-CTA as a primary imaging test (n=1139) or standard of care without initial CTA imaging (n=1017) were included in the study. ED visits, utilization of tests, and costs during the initial episode of hospital care were compared. No significant differences in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease, pulmonary embolism, or aortic dissection were observed. Median ED waiting time (4.5 vs. 7.0 h, P<0.001), median total length of hospital stay (5.0 vs. 32.0 h, P<0.001), hospital admission rate (12.6% vs. 54.2%, P<0.001), and ED return rate to our hospital within 30 days (3.5% vs. 14.6%, P<0.001) were significantly lower in the TRO-CTA group. Moreover, reduced rates of additional testing and invasive coronary angiography (4.9% vs. 22.7%, P<0.001), and ultimately lower total cost per patient (11,783$ vs. 19,073$, P<0.001) were observed in the TRO-CTA group. TRO-CTA as an initial imaging test in ED patients presenting with acute chest pain was associated with shorter ED and hospital length of stay, fewer return visits within 30 days, and ultimately lower ED and hospitalization costs."

She developed out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest and was resuscitated with no sequelae 5 days before admission. Computed tomography confirmed pericardial and left pleural effusions, and type A aortic dissection was diagnosed. We began emergency ascending aortic replacement surgery under general anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil and incidentally discovered a congenital partial left-sided pericardial defect that allowed drainage of the hemopericardium and relieved cardiac tamponade. The surgery was successfully performed, and the patient recovered without complications.

    "title": "Endovascular Approach to Severe Acute Type B Aortic Dissection.",
    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is an important emergency that should be identified promptly. The classification of AAD follows two different systems: Stanford (which defines lesions as types A, on the ascending aorta, or B, on the descending aorta) and DeBakey, which also accounts for the extension of the aortic dissection. We present a notable case of a 63-year-old male who presented with a history of abrupt abdominal pain radiating to the dorsal region for endovascular treatment. He was oliguric with symmetric pulses in the superior limbs and reduction of pulses in the left lower limbs, with signs of hypoperfusion. Angiotomography evidenced acute abdominal thoracic aortic dissection classified as DeBakey III and Stanford B, extending through the left iliac artery. He was submitted to endovascular correction of the abdominal thoracic aortic dissection, with implantation of two straight Valiant type endoprosthesis (26x200 mm and 38x200 mm), positioned after the emergence of the left subclavian artery and right above the celiac trunk, respectively. There was also implantation of the stent graft Viabahn (5x60 mm) and Assurant stent (7x30 mm) in the left renal artery. After the urgent surgical intervention, the patient has recovered well. He has been checked in outpatient follow-ups for the past three years with preserved renal function (1.5 mg/dl creatinine) and correct positioning of the endoprosthesis (confirmed by CT without contrast). Hypertension and a smoking history are the most important risk factors associated with aortic dissections, and should be considered when evaluating a patient with chest or back pain (typically described as sharp rather than tearing or ripping) in the emergency department. The endovascular approach to descending dissections was introduced in 1999 and has been established as the standard approach to descending dissections of the aorta, because of the excess mortality of the open approach (32% in open surgery and 7% for those managed with endovascular techniques) and low rate of complications. Ten-year survival rates for patients with AAD ranging from 30% to 60% justifies an aggressive follow-up strategy of discharge, with the goal of minimizing aortic wall stress through drugs (such as β blockers) and surveillance to detect progression. Our report shows that an early detection of symptoms coupled with an aggressive and precise endovascular intervention has produced satisfactory clinical, laboratorial and quality-of-life outcomes in an older patient with an extensive type B arterial dissection."

    "abstract": "Type A aortic dissection (TAAD) is a life-threatening disorder yet it is hard to diagnose. The dissection might extend to the coronary artery causing ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Physicians might not recognize this particularly early in its presentation and patients proceed to receive the primary percutaneous coronary intervention. We present such a case and found that the marked pressure difference between the radial and ascending aortae could be a useful clue for diagnosing the aortic dissection-related myocardial infarction. A 58-year-old male was presented to our emergency department for the complaint of left side chest pain that lasted for an hour with concomitant hypotension. STEMI was diagnosed at that time. The emergent primary percutaneous intervention was performed. When the diagnostic catheter was advanced to the ascending aorta, the systolic aorta pressure became 20 mm Hg higher than radial systolic pressure. Due to the abnormally large pressure differential between the peripheral radial artery and central ascending aorta, TAAD was suspected. After angiography and computer tomography confirmed the diagnosis of TAAD, the patient was sent for emergent surgery. The patient was died because of extensive dissection and shock. We present such a case and found that the marked pressure difference between the radial and ascending aortae during catheterization could be a useful clue for diagnosing the aortic dissection-related myocardial infarction. This clue had hinted our speedy examination of the occluded coronary artery and dissection flap, and led to an early and accurate diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Acute chest pain is one of the most common reasons for Emergency Department (ED) visits and hospital admissions. As this could represent the first symptom of a lifethreatening condition, urgent identification of the etiology of chest pain is of utmost importance in emergency settings. Such high-risk conditions that can present with acute chest pain in the ED include Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS), Pulmonary Embolisms (PE) and Acute Aortic Syndromes (AAS). The concept of Triple Rule-out Computed Tomographic Angiography (TRO-CTA) for patients presenting with acute chest pain in the ED is based on the use of coronary computed tomographic angiography as a single imaging technique, able to diagnose or exclude three lifethreatening conditions in one single step: ACS, AAS and PE. TRO-CTA protocols have been proved to be efficient in the ED for diagnosis or exclusion of life-threatening conditions and for differentiation between various etiologies of chest pain, and application of the TRO-CTA protocol in the ED for acute chest pain of uncertain etiology has been shown to improve the further clinical evaluation and outcomes of these patients. This review aims to summarize the main indications and techniques used in TRO protocols in EDs, and the role of TRO-CTA protocols in risk stratification of patients with acute chest pain."

The conservative surgeon prefers to perform aortic root up-to hemi arch replacement while the patient recovers planning onward for the second stage approach, however, the aggressive school prefers to replace the entire aortic arch with the deployment of a frozen elephant trunk and control intimal tear and alter false lumen natural history. Data to date remains debatable in terms of short- and long-term outcomes with equivocal results between both approaches.

After four courses of anlotinib treatment, he suffered a sudden onset of back pain, sweating, anxiety, and high blood pressure (180/120 mmHg) and heart rate (137 bpm). Emergency computed tomographic angiography revealed aortic dissection and thrombosis of the distal false lumen. Thereafter, the patient was administered nitroglycerin as antihypertensive treatment and he underwent stent-graft intervention for aortic dissection. Anticoagulants and antihypertensive drugs were administered after the operation, and a moderate control of blood pressure was achieved.

The majority of cases present as chronic arthritis, but a subset of CPPD can present as rapid onset of sharp pain and joint swelling, posing a diagnostic challenge. We present a case of a 64-year-old man with a history of hypertension, urologic cancer, and gout presenting to the emergency department (ED) with a sudden-onset, severe stabbing right shoulder pain radiating to the neck and upper back. On ED arrival, he was mildly hypotensive, afebrile, diaphoretic, and uncomfortable, causing concern for aortic dissection. His exam was significant for limited shoulder range of motion; his sensation, strength, and distal pulses were intact and equal in bilateral upper extremities. His plain films showed multilevel cervical degenerative disc disease and facet arthrosis and right glenohumeral osteoarthritis without fracture or malalignment. A computed tomography (CT) angiogram was negative for vascular anomalies. Throughout his ED stay, his pain was refractory to medication, and he developed a new fever, prompting a targeted shoulder ultrasound; this revealed large glenohumeral effusion, and synovial analysis revealed CPP crystals without organism growth. This case illustrates an unusual acute CPPD attack that mimicked an aortic dissection. Emergency physicians should recognize both common and uncommon presentations for chronic disease processes in maintaining a broad differential diagnosis and delivering quick, targeted treatment."

Atypical and unexplained symptoms on a background of congenital heart disease should trigger a referral to cardiology with thorough investigation, often with echocardiography, to exclude rare and life-threatening complications."

    "abstract": "The patient was a 52-year-old man who had undergone total arch replacement for type A aortic dissection 2 months before. He was admitted to our hospital with hemoptysis due to aortobronchial fistula. We planned to perform 1-stage open chest surgery, but he passed away before the surgery. We considered that earlier open surgery or emergency endovascular stent grafting might have been effective in avoiding this result."

    "abstract": "Pregnant patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) are at high risk of developing aortic dissection or rupture during the third trimester and early postpartum period. This increased likelihood is the consequence of the hyperdynamic and hypervolemic cardiocirculatory state and/or pregnancy-mediated structural changes of the arterial wall in response to hemodynamic and hormonal changes. In this article, we report on the case of a 26-year-old pregnant woman with MFS in the 30th gestation week, who presented with type A aortic dissection at the emergency department. According to the multidisciplinary team decision, an urgent cesarean section was performed, followed by the Bentall procedure. The patient was discharged on the 10th postoperative day, and her premature child was discharged 6 weeks after birth."

He was in circulatory shock with a blood pressure of 65/30 mm Hg, heart rate of 115 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute and a room air oxygen saturation of 89%. Examination demonstrated weak peripheral pulses, an elevated jugular venous pressure, faint dual heart sounds, no cardiac murmurs and bilateral lung crepitations. An ECG was recorded which showed a broad QRS (figure 1A). There were no previous ECGs to compare this with. In view of his presentation with acute-onset interscapular pain, CT of the aorta was organised by the emergency department clinicians (figure 1B-D). After the CT result was obtained, the on-call cardiologist was contacted and a bedside echocardiogram performed. This demonstrated severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesia of the apex and lateral walls. The patient was then transferred to the catheter laboratory for an emergency invasive coronary angiogram.heartjnl;106/2/126/F1F1F1Figure 1ECG and CT images at presentation (A) 12 lead ECG.

    "abstract": "This report describes the rapid expansion of a previously excluded abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) following type A aortic dissection repair in a 74-year-old male. Following successful Hemiarch replacement, CT angiography (CTA) showed residual dissection throughout the thoracoabdominal aorta, which had created a proximal endoleak at the prior endovascular stent graft resulting in the rapid growth of the residual AAA sac. Urgent thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) did not fully obliterate false lumen flow allowing further unstable expansion of the AAA and abdominal pain. This was ultimately managed with an open replacement of the infrarenal neck with a Dacron interposition graft sewn to the prior EVAR. Postoperative CTA showed resolution of the false lumen communication to the infrarenal AAA and no further endoleak. Open interposition AAA neck replacement is a possible treatment for new-onset endoleak in patients with aortic dissection following prior infrarenal EVAR."

We present a case of successful surgical management of extensive bowel necrosis caused by acute aortic dissection. A 42-year-old man underwent emergent subtotal resection of the small intestine, right colectomy, tube gastrostomy, and transverse colostomy; however, intestinal continuity was not restored. He developed two major postoperative complications: unconsciousness due to metabolic alkalosis caused by massive discharge from the gastrostomy and jaundice due to bile salt depletion caused by disruption of the enterohepatic circulation. His serum bilirubin levels decreased after the infusion of gastric discharge through gastrostomy into the transverse colon through the colostomy; thereafter, a second operation was performed to restore gastrointestinal continuity. Overall, patients undergoing massive bowel resection without intestinal continuity require careful management of electrolytes and bile salt."

    "abstract": "The 2 main techniques of valve-sparing aortic root replacement (VSRR) are remodeling and reimplantation. There is concern that the aortic annulus, which is not stabilized in remodeling technique, may dilate over time and cause aortic regurgitation. Our aim was to assess whether the aortic annulus dilates after VSRR with remodeling technique without aortic annuloplasty. Data on patients undergoing elective or urgent VSRR remodeling technique between 2005 and 2018 were collected. Patients undergoing arch and emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection were excluded. Preoperative aortic annulus diameter was measured by transthoracic echocardiography, and this was compared with the annulus diameter measured from the most recently available transthoracic echocardiography. The requirement for reintervention during follow-up was recorded. Between 2005 and 2018, 98 patients underwent VSRR. Sixty-six (67.3%) had Marfan syndrome or Loeys-Dietz syndrome. Median age was 60 (interquartile range, 18-68) years and 71 (72.4%) were men. Median cross-clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass times were 122 (interquartile range, 104-164) minutes and 138 (interquartile range, 121-198) minutes, respectively. Median intensive care unit and hospital stay were 1 day and 6 days, respectively. No patients suffered perioperative stroke. There was no in-hospital mortality. At median follow-up of 7.1 years (interquartile range, 5-129 months), mean postoperative annular diameter was 25.7 mm, from 24.2 mm preoperatively (P = .403). One patient required aortic valve replacement during follow-up. Freedom from moderate or severe aortic regurgitation was 97%. There was no significant aortic annular dilatation in selected patients undergoing remodeling VSRR. Our data do not support routine use of annuloplasty in patients with annular diameter less than or equal to 25 mm."

Patient mortality, survival and reoperation rate. Demographic data, cardiovascular risk factors, specific data by indication, technical resources and postoperative complications. A total of 135 urgent TEVARs were included (111 men, mean age 60.4 ± 16.3 years): 43 ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysms (31.9%), 54 type B dissections (40%) and 32 traumatic aortic injuries (23.7%), and other etiologies 4.4%. The overall mortality rate at 30 days was 18.5%, and proved higher in the ruptured descending thoracic aortic aneurysms group (27.9%). The mean actuarial survival rate was 67± 6% at 5 years. The postoperative stroke rate was 5.2%, and the paraplegia rate was 5.9%. Aortic reoperations proved necessary in 12 patients (9%). Emergency descending thoracic aortic diseases can be treated by endovascular techniques with optimal results and low morbidity and mortality - though the figures are slightly higher than in elective cases. This registry provides, for the first time, real information on the daily clinical practice of emergency TEVAR in Spain."

There have been several reports of APS with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) complicated with aortic dissection. However, none of them has been primary APS, which is APS without SLE. CASE REPORT A 42-year-old woman with primary APS and APS nephropathy on warfarin and aspirin therapy presented with coma due to cerebellar hemorrhage. The effect of warfarin was immediately reversed with prothrombin complex concentrate. We performed emergent evacuation of the hematoma, and her level of consciousness improved to normal on postoperative day (POD) 1. She had acute hypertension on arrival, which was resistant to multiple antihypertensives and was stabilized on POD 3. She also had exacerbation of chronic kidney disease after using contrast and prothrombin concentrate complex, and was on temporary renal replacement therapy from POD 3. Aortic dissection was found accidentally on echocardiography on POD 7, and she was subsequently treated medically. She was transferred to the rehabilitation hospital with mild dysarthria and truncal ataxia on POD 59. CONCLUSIONS We report the first case in the English literature of primary APS complicated with cerebellar hemorrhage and aortic dissection. Acute hypertension following hemorrhage and exacerbation of APS nephropathy likely triggered the dissection of the aortic wall, the integrity of which might have been compromised by longstanding antiphospholipid antibody and vasa vasorum thrombosis."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic syndromes (AAS) represent a spectrum of disorders with a common theme of disruption in aortic integrity. AAS are associated with high morbidity and mortality and warrant emergent medical or surgical intervention as delayed treatment is associated with worse outcomes. There are multiple advanced imaging modalities for the diagnosis and complimentary assessment of AAS, each with advantages and limitations. CT angiography remains the imaging modality of choice for diagnosis in the overwhelming majority of patients as it is rapidly acquired and widely available; however, transoesophageal echocardiogram also offers excellent diagnostic accuracy in addition to complimentary data for surgical repair in those with type A dissection. Transthoracic echocardiography and magnetic resonance angiography can also be valuable in select patients. Imaging is increasingly important for risk stratification in the subacute and chronic phases of AAS. Additionally, imaging is vital for planning of interventions in both acute and delayed intervention. Endovascular treatment options are used with increasing frequency-multimodality imaging during the procedure allows for optimisation of these increasingly complex procedures."

    "abstract": "Drugs such as stimulants, sedatives, sleeping pills, and narcotics are associated with drug abuse and are therefore regulated by law. Physical dependence on these drugs is sometimes difficult to control despite an awareness of the problems they cause in daily life and the harm they can cause to the body. Drug dependence is a social problem worldwide, and the physical implications are serious. Many of these drugs cause cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases, which often require emergency medical treatment. Differential diagnosis is essential because of the likelihood of life-threatening events, especially among young people who exhibit cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases without any of the typical risk factors. Drugs of abuse, especially stimulants, induce a hyperadrenergic state that evokes vasoconstriction and tachycardia, as well as subsequent ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmias, and aortic dissection. Chronic drug abuse can also cause cardiac hypertrophy and left ventricular dysfunction. As a treatment for these conditions, sedative drugs can be effective but the use of vasodilators may also be required. There are concerns that the use of both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers may cause tachycardia and increased blood pressure. Therefore, careful differential diagnosis and selection of therapeutic agents is required."

Despite advancements in surgical procedures, still, ATAAD remains a surgical emergency associated with high mortality. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare whether either ascending aorta replacement (AR) or total aortic arch replacement (TR) leads to improved short- and long-term clinical outcomes. A search of PubMed, Embase, Science Direct, Web of Science, SciELO, BIOSIS, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases were supplemented by searching through bibliographies of key articles. Thereafter, data on early and late prognostic factors were extracted. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 studies were performed to compare whether either AR or TR leads to a reduction in the risk of in-hospital and short-term mortality, postoperative complications, re-operation rate, and long-term mortality. A total of 15 cohort studies (n = 2822 patients with ATAAD; AR with HA, partial arch = 1911, TR = 911) were deemed eligible and included in the meta-analysis. Compared with TR, AR led to a significantly lower risk of in-hospital mortality (RR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.61-0.96), shorter cardiopulmonary bypass time (CPB, mean difference = -53.09; 95% CI: -56.68--49.50), circulatory arrest time (CA, mean difference = -8.09; 95% CI: -9.04-7.15), and antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP, mean difference = -28.62; 95% CI: -30.23--27.00). Differences in the incidence rates of neurological dysfunctions and renal dialysis were not significant. The pooled rate of aortic re-operation was lower in TR group (AR 7.6% vs. TR 5.3%), albeit not significantly (risk ratio = 1.39; 95% CI: 0.94-2.07; p = 0.10). These findings demonstrate that AR is associated with a lower early mortality rate and shorter operative times overall. Nevertheless, the incidence of postoperative complications in patients undergoing AR is comparable to that of patients undergoing TR. Further prospective follow-up data needs to be collected and analyzed to discern whether there are statistically significant differences in the risks of re-operation and long-term mortality between AR and TR procedures."

We collected new episodes of AAD between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2018 from the emergency department of a major hospital in Shanghai, China. The overdispersed generalized additive model was used to estimate the association between PM2.5 and AAD emergency hospitalizations and was adjusted for time trends and weather conditions. During the study period, we identified a total of 1335 cases of AAD hospitalizations and recorded an average PM2.5 concentration of 45 ± 30 μg/m3. The association was statistically significant on the concurrent day of hospital admission, remained on the lag 1 day. For the average of the two lags, a 10 μg/m3 increase of PM2.5 was associated with 3.38% (95% confidence interval: 1.02%, 5.79%) increase of AAD hospitalizations. The association between PM2.5 and AAD remained when adjusting for the concomitant exposures to coarse particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and ozone. The concentration-response curves increased apparently when daily PM2.5 concentration was beyond the China's National Ambient Air Quality Standard (35 μg/m3). In stratified analyses, the significant association was only present among elders and males, and during cool season. This investigation demonstrated a significant and robust association between short-term PM2.5 exposure and increased AAD hospitalizations in Shanghai, China. Our findings have important implications for the prevention of AAD."

Methods: Clinical data of 7 patients underwent surgical treatment for endograft infection after TEAVR at Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Changhai Hospital, the Navy Medical University between January 2016 and December 2018 were analyzed retrospectively. There were 6 males and 1 female, aging (51.5±16.7) years (range: 25 to 68 years). The origin of the aortic disease was descending aortic aneurysm in 5 cases, and Stanford B aortic dissection in 2 cases. Abdominal aorta below the level of the diaphragm was not involved in all patients. Two patients received \"chimney technology\" for left subclavian artery procedures. Time to infection was 5(3) months (M(Q(R))) (range: 1 to 24 months). Aortic endograft infection was diagnosed with a combination of microbiology (positive blood cultures, except one with mycotic), radiological evidence and clinical evidence of sepsis. Two patients suffered from aorto-esophageal fistula received emergency surgery, others were treated with elective surgery. Extra-anatomic prosthetic graft bypass was used for reconstruction of aorta, infected endogarft and aorta was removed, sac drainage was performed. Aorto-esophageal fistula was procedured according to the degree of lesions. All patients received antibiotics with specialist advice for 6 to 8 weeks. Results: One patient died due to septic shock. In the follow-time (range: 6 to 24 months), 1 patient suffered from thoracic infection in 3 months after surgery, an other patient got iliac abscess after a month. Conclusions: Endograft infection after TEAVR is high risk but may be curative. Appropriate selection of patients for infected endograft explantation could get a satisfied results. 目的： 探讨胸主动脉腔内修复术（TEVAR）后支架感染外科治疗的效果。 方法： 回顾性分析2016年1月至2018年12月因TEVAR术后支架感染在海军军医大学长海医院心血管外科接受外科治疗的7例患者的临床资料。男性6例，女性1例；年龄（51.5±16.7）岁（范围：25~68岁）。降主动脉瘤5例，Stanford B型主动脉夹层2例；主动脉病变未累及膈肌平面以下的腹主动脉。7例患者中2例术中行左锁骨下动脉\"烟囱\"技术植入支架。支架感染发生在TEVAR术后5（3）个月[M（Q(R)），范围：1~24个月]。所有患者存在反复发热，血培养阳性者6例。2例合并主动脉-食管瘘伴消化道出血患者行急诊手术，5例行择期手术。所有患者于全身麻醉非体外循环下行人工血管旁路移植+感染血管段切除、局部旷置引流术，合并食管瘘者1例行同期修补，1例行食管局部切除、二期行胃代食管手术。术后继续给予敏感抗菌药物治疗6~8周。 结果： 住院死亡1例，死因为术后早期发生感染性休克。另6例患者术后恢复良好出院。随访6~24个月，曲霉菌感染者术后3个月发生相应胸椎体曲霉菌感染而再次手术，1例患者术后1个月发生髂骨脓肿于骨科接受手术治疗，其余患者随访期间无感染复发。 结论： TEVAR术后感染行人工血管旁路移植+感染段主动脉切除、局部引流联合后期的正规抗感染治疗可获得良好的预后。对于存在主动脉食管瘘的患者，可根据食管损伤范围及程度行同期修补或二期手术治疗。."

    "abstract": "Traditional aortic arch replacement surgery must be performed under moderate or deep hypothermia (22-28 °C) and circulatory arrest. Hypothermia and hypoperfusion can cause damage to the nervous system; therefore, postoperative brain and spinal cord complications are common. Improvements in surgical techniques are necessary to solve this problem. Herein, we report a method of total aortic arch replacement that can be performed at a core temperature of 34 °C, similar to other simple cardiac operations. Four patients underwent surgery with this technique (3 males and 1 female, aged 48 to 67 years). Computed tomography angiography performed at admission showed a total aortic dissection, resulting in a diagnosis of Stanford type A aortic dissection. The patients underwent emergency aortic sinus remodelling, ascending aortic replacement, modified aortic arch replacement, and elephant trunk stenting. No patients had neurological complications. During a follow-up of more than 1-month, no patients had aortic valve regurgitation or anastomotic leak. This technique can increase the operating temperature by approximately 6 to 12 °C and reduce the circulatory arrest time by approximately 18 to 28 min. All of the patients recovered well without any neurological complications, demonstrating the feasibility and safety of this technique. We believe that this technique can serve as a good alternative strategy for managing aortic dissection and aneurysm, especially for young surgeons who are acquiring experience in arch replacement surgery."

We identified patients hospitalized in certified teaching hospitals in Japan with rAA between April 1, 2012, and March 31, 2015. Patients' characteristics and in-hospital outcomes were compared between men and women. The Barthel index was used for evaluating functional status at discharge by examining the ability to perform basic daily activities. Of 7086 eligible patients, 32.3% (2291/7086) were women. Women were older than men (81.9 years vs 76.1 years; P < .001), had higher prevalence of coma at admission (33.2% vs 25.2%; P < .001), and were less likely to undergo emergency operation including endovascular aneurysm repair (35.7% vs 51.1%; P < .001). The unadjusted mortality rate (62.5% vs 52.0%; P < .001) and Barthel index at discharge (78.7 vs 86.1; P < .001) were significantly worse in women than in men. However, multilevel mixed-effect logistic regression analyses showed that female sex itself was not an independent predictor for in-hospital death (odds ratio [OR], 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78-1.04; P = .17). Older age, coma at admission, and vasopressor use were detected as independent predictors for in-hospital death. The same results were confirmed for each rupture site. Stratified analyses showed that older women (threshold, 80 years; OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66-0.98; P = .028) and those who underwent emergency operation (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61-0.93; P = .009) showed significantly better outcomes than men. In a univariate analysis, female patients with rAA showed worse mortality than men because of their older age, more severe clinical presentation, and low emergency operation rate. However, after adjustment for covariates, female sex itself was not associated with increased mortality."

    "abstract": "This study investigated the outcomes of emergency in situ laser fenestration (ISLF)-assisted thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for patients with acute Stanford type A aortic dissection unfit for open surgery. Twenty patients with acute Stanford type A aortic dissection who were found to be unfit for open surgery, underwent emergency ISLF-assisted TEVAR in our center between March 2016 and December 2018. Anatomic criteria for endovascular repair: coronary artery and aortic valve was not involved, proximal landing zone diameter of 45 mm or less, and proximal landing zone length of 20 mm or greater. Their clinical outcomes were reviewed retrospectively. Twenty patients achieved a procedural success of 100.0%. The 30-day mortality was 10%; two patients died, one of severe pneumonia and the other from cerebral hemorrhage after the operation. Rate of stroke at 30 days was 5%. The average follow-up time was 16 months (range, 3-26 months). One death owing to heart failure occurred at 23 months postoperatively. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis revealed that the 24-month survival rate was 77.1%. Two patients had type Ia endoleaks and one had a type II endoleak. There was no stent graft migration or fenestration-related endoleak and all patients had a thrombosed false lumen in the covered section of the stent grafts. No reintervention, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attacks, cerebral infarction, or other complications occurred during the follow-up period. Emergency ISLF-assisted TEVAR is a safe and effective alternative method for treating acute Stanford type A aortic dissection unfit for open surgery."

    "abstract": "Type A-aortic dissection (TAAD) is a life-threatening diagnosis made in the emergency department (ED). Many presentations mimic acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and over a third of TAAD patients present with raised cardiac enzymes, many of whom have ACS-like changes on the electrocardiogram. The aim of this study was to assess the current practice in diagnosis and management of TAAD. Between April and October 2018, a structured survey was distributed to ED Consultants across the UK. Questions surrounded: i) simulated clinical scenarios which mimicked ACS in the early stages (where TAAD could simultaneously be the diagnosis); and ii) ED infrastructure for TAAD management. Responses were received from 175 ED consultants across 70 hospital Trusts. In the context of chest pain and ST elevation, 97% of ED consultants considered this sufficient to diagnose ACS, and over half (54%) agreed with committing to treatment (including the use of thrombolysis) prior to further investigation. Early committers to ACS treatment were statistically less likely to ever order a CT scan or d-dimer (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.12-0.83, p = 0.02). In total, 32% of consultants reported they would ever request a CT chest in the context of chest pain and elevated troponin. The lack of an AD algorithm was the strongest predictor of clinicians avoiding the use of more definitive investigations for TAAD (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.01-0.64, p = 0.05). In TAAD patients presenting with chest pain and elevated cardiac enzymes there is a high probability of ACS treatment being commenced and a significant risk of failing to request the necessary imaging to diagnose TAAD."

We report herein a unique case of spontaneous superior mesenteric artery dissection (SMAD) after UGI pandenoscopy. A 45-year-old man who had previously undergone UGI panendoscopy and colonoscopy during a voluntary health check-up at our facility was admitted to the emergency room (ER) at the same facility due to persistent epigastric pain with radiation to the back. At the ER, the patient did not present notable abnormalities upon physical, conscious, or laboratory examinations apart from mild tenderness in the epigastric abdomen. Acute abdominal aortic dissection was suspected, and abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography confirmed SMAD. He was then transferred to the cardiovascular ward and treated conservatively with fasting, prostaglandin E1, and aspirin. The patient recovered and returned home soon after, and was symptom-free 6 months after discharge from the facility. SMAD after UGI panendoscopic procedure is a previously unreported complication. Awareness of this complication and associated sequela is warranted."

Between April 1998 and April 2018, 644 patients were treated at our institution with an acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) or ATAAIMH, 82 (13%) had intramural hematomas (IMHs) including 12 (15%) with malperfusion syndrome (MPS) and 70 (85%) without MPS (no MPS). Data was obtained through medical record review, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons data elements, and the National Death Index database. Both MPS and No MPS groups had similar comorbidities including coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease; however, those with MPS were sicker on admission with higher rates of acute renal failure (50% vs. 1%, P<0.0001) and acute paralysis (17% vs. 0%, P=0.02). Patients with MPS amenable to endovascular reperfusion (n=10) underwent endovascular fenestration/stenting and delayed aortic repair. Those with cerebral or coronary MPS (n=2) and those without MPS (n=70) underwent emergent open aortic repair. Of the ten patients undergoing fenestration/stenting, seven went on to aortic repair, one survived to discharge without aortic repair, one died from aortic rupture on hospital day 34, and one died from organ failure prior to aortic repair. Following endovascular fenestration/stenting or aortic repair, all patients with MPS had higher in-hospital mortality (17% vs. 0%), P=0.02. Following aortic repair, patients with MPS had more postoperative sepsis and longer postoperative length of stay (all P<0.05). However, both groups had a 0% operative mortality (including in-hospital and 30-day mortality following aortic repair). The 5-year survival of all ATAAIMH patients was 79%. The 2-year survival was significantly better in the No MPS group (94% vs. 62%, P=0.006). ATAAIMH with MPS can be effectively managed with upfront endovascular fenestration/stenting followed by delayed aortic repair."

    "abstract": "Acute Type-A aortic dissection (AD) is a challenging clinical emergency. Despite advances in diagnosis and surgical techniques, the high surgical mortality rate of the condition persists. As a result of similarities in clinical symptoms, AD can mimic acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In this paper, we report 2 cases of patients with acute AD manifesting as inferior AMI. Two patients with undetected AD were misdiagnosed with AMI; in such patients, the administration of thrombolytic therapy has disastrous consequences. The patients were initially diagnosed with AMI in the emergency room, and then diagnosed with AD during catheterization. The patients were transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for primary coronary angiography. The initial attempt to selectively engage the coronary ostium was unsuccessful. Subsequent computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed AD from the aortic root to the abdominal aorta and dissection violations of the coronary ostium. The patients underwent emergency aortic root replacement. One patient recovered and was discharged 2 weeks later. At a 1-year follow-up examination, CTA indicated that this patient had made a full recovery. The other patient died 6 days after surgery. As a result of similarities in clinical symptoms, AD can mimic AMI. Rapid diagnosis and treatment of AD is crucial. Difficulty during catheter engagement should raise the suspicion of acute Type-A AD."

We aimed to identify the atypical symptoms in a timely manner without putting patients at greater risk for undetected AAD. We conducted a retrospective observational study of 59 AAD patients with both atypical and typical symptoms from January 2012 to December 2016. Patients with atypical symptoms continuing more than 30 min underwent a D-dimer test and computed tomography (CT) or computed tomographic angiography (CTA). Of the 59 AAD patients, 22 were atypical. In the atypical group, the median delay time in our hospital was 3.1 h; average delay time after July 2015 was shorter than average delay time before June 2015 (16.59 ± 24.70 vs. 1.90 ± 0.57 h, P = 0.076). For patients in the emergency department who are suspected of having AAD, incorporating atypical symptoms with high levels of D-dimer into a triage strategy could improve the efficiency of clinical decision making. Furthermore, essential education directed towards the recognition of the atypical symptoms of AAD for front-line physicians may aid in a timely diagnosis, as compared with the usual assessments in the emergency department."

Currently, five subtypes are distinguished, among which AD class 3 -also known as limited or subtle AD- is the less recognised. This type of dissection is infrequent and needs to be acknowledged radiologically in order not to go unnoticed. Regarding its imaging features, this entity is characterized by a small focal bulging of the aortic wall outline and/or a limited round dilation at the region affected by the intimal tear. Recently, the low familiarity of the radiologist with this condition has been emphasized. With the aim of illustrating the main imaging findings of this entity and reviewing its most relevant aspects, we present four cases of AD class 3 diagnosed in our hospital."

    "abstract": "Left subclavian artery revascularization during endovascular repair of aortic dissection is often accomplished by left carotid-subclavian artery bypass or transposition. In situ fenestration of thoracic stent grafts provides an alternative method of revascularization without manipulation of the left carotid artery. We describe a case whereby in situ laser fenestration, combined with catheter-directed thrombectomy, was utilized to revascularize a thrombosed left subclavian artery following a frozen elephant trunk repair of type A aortic dissection. A 75-year-old male presented with pericardial tamponade and aortic insufficiency, secondary to type A aortic dissection. Patient underwent an emergent replacement of the aortic root, valve, arch, and ascending aorta in the frozen elephant trunk configuration. The innominate and left carotid arteries were revascularized with a bifurcated bypass graft from the ascending aortic graft. The left subclavian artery (LSCA) was covered with an antegrade deployment of a cTAG stent graft. During the immediate postoperative period, the patient was found to have a dissection of the left common carotid artery (LCCA) and pseudoaneurysm of the bypass graft anastomosis. The left carotid artery was replaced up to the proximal internal carotid. During rehabilitation, the patient developed left subclavian steal syndrome, with a CT angiography demonstrating thrombosis of the subclavian origin, and duplex ultrasound showing a reversal of the left vertebral flow. In order to revascularize the left subclavian artery without using the left carotid as the inflow, the in situ laser fenestration technique was planned. The vertebral artery origin was protected with a neuroclip through a supraclavicular incision. Through a brachial artery cutdown, a 9Fr flex sheath was positioned at the origin of the subclavian artery. A suction thrombectomy catheter was used to create a central channel in the thrombus. A 0.035″ 3.2 mm over-the-wire laser atherectomy catheter was used to create a fenestration through the cTAG stent graft. The subclavian branch stent was stented with an iCast balloon-expandable covered stent, excluding the mural thrombus. The patient recovered well with resolution of symptoms and was discharged home. Postoperative CT scan showed patent left subclavian branch stent and no endoleak across the fenestration of the aortic stent graft. Delayed laser in situ fenestration of a PTFE stent graft can be performed safely. The vertebral artery protection and catheter-directed thrombectomy are important adjuncts to reduce the risk of posterior stroke."

The objective of this study was to analyze early and late outcomes of aortic surgery with hypothermic circulatory arrest in patients aged 70 and above at our institution. We performed a retrospective cohort study including every patient aged 70 years or older who underwent aortic surgery with hypothermic circulatory arrest between January 1995 and June 2016 at our institution. Operative results were compared with the contemporary younger counterparts aged <70 years. In-hospital mortality and postoperative stroke were primary outcomes of interest. The main secondary outcomes included acute renal failure, reoperation for bleeding, and spinal cord injury. In the study population, the in-hospital mortality was 16.8% (21/125). Ten (8.0%) patients presented postoperative stroke, and 6 had temporary neurologic disturbance (4.8%). Spinal cord injury occurred in 1 (0.8%) patient. For elective interventions and type A aortic dissections, the in-hospital mortality and stroke rates were 4.6% (3/65) and 7.7% (5/65), 26.8% (11/41) and 12.2% (5/41), respectively. The proportion of non-elective interventions, including type A aortic dissection, and the type of neuroprotective strategy were similar in septuagenarians and younger patients. Patients aged ≥70 had significant shorter cardiopulmonary bypass, myocardial ischemia, and circulatory arrest durations, compared to their younger counterparts. The in-hospital mortality of septuagenarians and younger patients were similar for elective surgery (4.6% vs. 4.7%, P=0.900) and aortic dissections (26.8% vs. 15.1%, P=0.107). There was no statistically significant difference between the two age groups regarding postoperative stroke, spinal cord injury, renal failure requiring dialysis or reintervention for bleeding. Estimated 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival was 78.0%, 70.6%, and 65.7%, respectively. The 5-year survival for elective surgery was 74.9% and 56.0% for non-elective procedures. Aortic surgery with circulatory arrest in the elderly demonstrated favorable early and late results when compared with younger individuals, with an acceptable operative risk even under emergency conditions, and should not be denied only because of the chronological age of the patients."

NLR and PLR were significantly elevated in patients with type A AAD (P<0.001 and <0.001, respectively). Based on the receiver operating characteristic curve, the best NLR cut-off value to predict in-hospital mortality was 9.74, with 70.6% sensitivity and 76.8% specificity, whereas the best PLR cut-off value was 195.8, with 76.5% sensitivity and 78.1% specificity. Admission NLR and PLR levels were important risk factors and independently associated with in-hospital mortality of type A AAD patients."

    "abstract": "Few reports on the outcomes of patients treated for Stanford type A acute aortic intramural haematoma (TAAIMH) and retrograde thrombosed type A acute aortic dissection exist. This study aimed to evaluate their long-term results and predictors of adverse outcomes. We retrospectively analysed 40 patients with TAAIMH and retrograde thrombosed type A acute aortic dissection. All patients underwent urgent surgery on presentation of life-threatening complications. Before discharge, 18 patients underwent open aortic surgery, and 22 were treated with medical therapy alone. Clinical features of these patients and image appearances were reviewed, and the relationship with overall survival, aortic events, and aortic death was investigated. The in-hospital mortality rate was 4.5% (1 patient) with medical therapy alone and 11.1% (2 patients) with surgical intervention. No patient with initial medical therapy required urgent surgery for life-threatening complications beyond 3 days of admission. The overall survival and aortic death-free survival rates at 1, 5 and 10 years were 85.0%, 72.5% and 59.8% and 90.0%, 81.6% and 77.1%, respectively. TAAIMH associated with penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU) was a risk factor of aortic events (P = 0.020) and significantly influenced aortic death-free survival (P = 0.003). Urgent surgery for complicated TAAIMH and retrograde thrombosed type A acute aortic dissection patients and initial medical therapy for uncomplicated patients show favourable long-term survival rates. TAAIMH is frequently associated with PAU; PAU enlargement is common. Although PAU can remain stable for years, it is a strong predictor of poor prognosis. For optimal long-term results, surgical repair is recommended for TAAIMH associated with PAU."

Of all the aortic dissections, less than 10% involve patients younger than 40 years of age. We present the case of a forty-yearold male who presented in the emergency department with non-specific complaints of nausea and lightheadedness. The patient being hemodynamically and clinically stable was discharged after supportive treatment. However after 5 hours the patient presented again in the emergency department with a neck pain, hypotension and sweating. CT angiography revealed a massive aortic dissection involving ascending, arch and descending aorta up to the bifurcation of iliac arteries. The patient was immediately taken for surgery for the replacement of ascending aorta and resuspension of aortic valve. The patient tolerated surgery well and was discharged after being clinically and haemodynamically stable."

The reported mortality rate is 50% to 65% within the first 48 hours without surgical intervention. Open surgery therefore remains the gold standard management for ATAAD. However, in patients who are deemed unfit for surgery and where possible, endovascular repair offers a useful alternative to medical treatment alone or high-risk open surgical repair. Several case reports, case series, and retrospective studies have reported good outcomes following endovascular treatment. The endovascular option also has comparable early and late outcomes, favourable aortic remodelling, and satisfactory overall survival despite having a higher-risk patient cohort. However, stenting in patients with ATAAD undoubtedly still has several limitations and technical challenges."

    "abstract": "Our goal was to report our results of late surgical conversion after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Variables analysed included baseline data, preinterventional anatomy, type of endovascular intervention, indications for conversion, operative technique, postoperative complications and follow-up survival rate. Between April 2011 and May 2018, 16 patients with late complications after EVAR underwent open surgical conversion at our institution. The mean age was 73.6 [standard deviation (SD) 8.9] years. There were 3 (18.8%) female patients. In 15 patients, the indication for primary EVAR was abdominal aortic aneurysm, and in 1 patient, chronic abdominal aortic dissection. Five patients underwent secondary EVAR service interventions for endoleak treatment between the index EVAR and the final secondary surgical conversion. Thirteen patients underwent surgery in an elective setting and 3 patients underwent emergency surgery. The mean time from EVAR to open surgical conversion was 6.31 (SD 4.0) years (range 1.2-16.0 years). The most common indication for conversion was endoleak formation (n = 12, 75%), followed by 3 cases of aortic rupture (1 patient with primary type 1 endoleak) and 2 cases of stent graft infection-1 with and 1 without an aortoduodenal fistula. One patient died during emergency open surgery of cardiopulmonary instability. Three patients developed postoperative renal dysfunction with recovery of their renal function before discharge. The in-hospital mortality rate was 12.5%. The median follow-up was 16.5 months (interquartile range 21 months). Freedom from death and aortic reintervention was 100%, respectively. After careful review of the index computed tomography scans for EVAR, the majority of failures could have been anticipated due to trade-offs with regard to length, diameter, morphology, shape and angulation of the proximal and/or distal landing zone. Despite being a challenging operation, late surgical conversion after EVAR yields excellent results with regard to outcome and freedom from the need for further aortic interventions. An anticipative strategy adhering to current recommendations for using or refraining from using EVAR in patients with anatomical challenges will help reduce the need for secondary surgical conversions and keep them to minimum."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic syndromes are emergent life-threatening conditions affecting the aorta, which actual incidence is difficult to determine. Mortality of untreated patients increases steadily over time, so early diagnosis and initiation of therapy are crucial. Management of patients in Czech Republic follow, similar as in other European countries, the European Society of Cardiology guidelines from 2014, which were updated in 2018. The basis for diagnosis consists of history, physical examination, ECG, determination of vital signs, hemodynamic status and stratification of dia-gnosis probability by ADD-RS (aortic dissection detection risk score). This is followed by a series of laboratory and imaging examinations, of which the D-dimer, CT aortography and echocardiography are the most important. Recent studies show the benefit of combination of ADD-RS with D-dimer or measurement of ascendant aorta diameter by echocardiography. New emerging biomarkers are currently under investigation. Thanks to advances in technology, magnetic resonance imaging could take place as emergent diagnostic tool in the future. Initial therapy depends on the hemodynamic status of the patient. It must be followed by definitive therapy. In this publication we summarize the approach to a patient with acute aortic syndrome in the emergency department focusing on aortic dissection as its most common type."

It is believed that interventions for these diseases on overtime hours (night shifts or weekend shifts) may increase mortality. In this study, we investigated the effect of performing acute type A aortic dissection surgery on overtime hours in terms of postoperative outcomes. 206 patients who underwent emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection were retrospectively evaluated. Two groups were constituted: patients operated on daytime working hours (n=61), and patients operated on overtime hours (n=145), respectively. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and repeat surgery were higher in group 1. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of operative and postoperative results. Mortality rates and postoperative neurological complications in group 1 were 9.8% and 13.1%, respectively. In group 2, these rates were 13.8% and 12.4%, respectively (P=0.485 - P=0.890). Multivariate analysis identified that cross-clamp time, amount of postoperative drainage, preoperative loss of consciousness and postoperative neurological complications are the independent predictors of mortality. As the surgical experience of the clinics improves, treatment of acute type A aortic dissections can be successfully performed both overtime and daytime working hours."

A 56-year-old man with history of hypertension presented with acute onset of altered mental status and right hand numbness. Initial vital signs were remarkable for bradycardia with heart rate 36/min. Physical exam was only significant for decreased sensation for light touch on right hand. Electrocardiogram showing marked sinus bradycardia. Initial computed tomography (CT) head did not show any acute abnormalities. On Day 2, patient complained of new weakness in left upper extremity. On exam, he had dysmetria, left upper extremity drift and cold to touch. Blood pressure was significantly different in both arms with 141/83 mmHg on right and 44/23 mmHg on left. He underwent immediate CT angiography chest showing Type 1 aortic dissection with extension into the brachiocephalic artery and right common carotid artery (RCCA) with thrombosis in RCCA. Patient was emergently taken for surgical repair of aortic dissection and resuspension of aortic valve. In our case, the initial presentation of aortic dissection included isolated sinus bradycardia without cardiac symptoms and no evidence for atrioventricular block.

Here, we report the results of a consecutive, single-surgeon series of 45 AADA patients with the David procedure as first-choice treatment strategy. Methods and Results: Between September 2009 and July 2013 a total of 49 patients with AADA were consecutively operated by the same surgeon at our institution. The David procedure was the treatment of choice for the proximal aorta unless aortic valve pathology or critical preoperative patient status advocated against it. Median follow-up was 5.0 years (CI95%, 4.0-6.0). Out of the 45 patients included in this study the David procedure was performed in 28 patients (62.2%), while in 17 patients (37.8%) an alternative surgical strategy had to be pursued. Although X-clamping (168.5 ± 41.7 vs. 110.3 ± 51.1 min; p = 0.001), cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (245.0 ± 62.4 vs. 211.8 ± 123 min; p = 0.029) and total operation time (383.8 ± 88.5 vs. 312.8 ± 144.8; p = 0.047) were significantly longer in the David-group as compared to the non-David group, there was no difference in major complication rate as well as 30-day (17.9 vs. 23.5%; p = 0.645) and 5-year mortality (28.6 vs. 35.3%) between groups. Conclusions: This small series indicates that the David procedure may be safe and feasible as a primary surgical treatment strategy for AADA."

There is lack of consensus on the exact site and size of aortic diameter measurement that increases this risk, and whether this applies to both Type A and Type B dissections. Case  A 23-year-old G2P1001 with known Marfan syndrome who underwent an uncomplicated antepartum and intrapartum course. She experienced persistent backache 10 days postpartum that led to the diagnosis of Stanford Type B dissection. The patient was hospitalized for close observation. Dissection progressed to aortic rupture within 24 hours that required emergent thoracic endovascular aortic repair. She had an uncomplicated postoperative course. Conclusion  Our report demonstrates rupture of a known aortic dissection within a very short time in the postpartum period. The case highlights the importance of patient education and close surveillance especially in the postpartum period. It also brings home the value of imaging of the whole aorta rather than focusing on the ascending alone. Multidisciplinary care and timely diagnosis and intervention likely led to the favorable outcome in our case."

A single-center review of 102 patients who underwent aortic surgeries for ATAD was conducted. The cohort was divided into those operated on by aortic specialists (AS:3 surgeons) and non-AS (5 surgeons). Multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were fitted to evaluate associations between the surgeon experience, perioperative outcomes, and survival, respectively. Of 102 patients, 60 were operated on by AS and 42 were operated on by non-AS. Overall 30-day mortality was 11 (10.8%) with 4 (6.6%) perioperative deaths in the AS group and 7 (16.6%) among the non-AS group (p = 0.2). AS performed a significantly higher number of root replacement procedures (41.6% vs. 23.8%, respectively, p = 0.049) and employed more frequent adjunct cerebral perfusion during circulatory arrest (p = 0.003).

A 26-mm Sapien XT prosthesis (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) was successfully implanted, and TAVI was performed using cardiopulmonary bypass. His postoperative clinical course was unremarkable on the first day. On postoperative day 3, however, his systemic circulation suddenly collapsed due to cardiac tamponade. We performed an emergency re-thoracotomy. This operation improved his systemic circulation, but he had no movement in either leg. Magnetic resonance imaging showed spinal cord ischemia around the T10 level and acute multifocal micro cerebral infarctions. The cause of his neurological symptoms was thought to be spinal cord ischemia brought about by the shaggy aorta and low blood pressure due to cardiac tamponade after TAVI. <Learning objective: Postoperative spinal cord injury is caused by hypotension embolisms, and aortic dissection particularly in patients with severe aortic arteriosclerosis. Spinal cord ischemia is a rare complication after transcatheter aortic valve implantation because the descending aorta is not operated upon. However, it is necessary to keep in mind that postoperative hemodynamic instability can cause spinal cord ischemia in patients with a shaggy aorta.>."

Electronic searches were performed on PubMed and Cochrane databases with no limits placed on dates. Search terms were charted to MeSH terms and combined using Boolean operations, and also used as key words. Papers were selected on the basis of title and abstract. The reference lists of selected papers were reviewed to identify any relevant papers that might be suitable for inclusion in the study. Papers were selected based on providing primary end points of death, rupture, or dissection and/or information regarding aortic aneurysm growth. Papers were not excluded based on patient population age. We demonstrated the lack of evidence for quality outcomes in type A aortic dissection in the United Kingdom. This highlighted the unwarranted variation seen in this entity and the caveats needed to improve structuring of type A aortic dissection from early identification in emergency departments to arrival at destination site for optimum intervention. Emergency services should be restructured to meet the immediate affirmation of diagnosis with gold standard imaging modality available. Management of this dire disease should be instituted at local hospitals prior to transportation and results should be audited regularly to improve quality outcomes. Attempts should be made to create local area networks to improve the efficiencies and outcomes of the service and transfer to centers with concentration of expertise. Recognition of regional networks by the UK Government Care Quality Commission should in part based on cumulative evidence sought after from virtual multidisciplinary teams. Unwarranted variation is an avenue that requires to be addressed to rise with service provision that meets our patients aspiration and be of current evidence in the 21st era."

    "abstract": "Anterior spinal artery syndrome, usually resulting in flaccid paraplegia, is a rare but disastrous complication that can occur after surgery of aortic aneurysms and aortic dissections. Spinal cord infarct as the initial clinical presentation of aortic dissection is a very rare finding. A 42-year-old male patient who comes to the emergency department due to severe chest pain associated with presyncope and paraplegia of the lower limbs in the context of type A aortic dissection. Recognizing this atypical clinical presentation of aortic dissection and knowing how to approach it is critical for an early diagnosis and to minimize the risk of spinal cord ischemia during surgery. La lesión de la médula espinal, generalmente resultante en paraplejia flácida, es una complicación rara, pero desastrosa, que puede ocurrir tras intervenciones quirúrgicas de aneurismas o disecciones de aorta. La presentación clínica inicial de una disección de aorta como un síndrome de la arteria espinal anterior es un hallazgo muy infrecuente. Varón de 42 años que acude al servicio de urgencias hospitalario por dolor torácico intenso asociado a cuadro presincopal y paraplejia de miembros inferiores en el contexto de una disección de aorta tipo A.

    "abstract": "The number of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients has increased, but there have been few reports of thoracic aortic surgery in patients with ESRD. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the early and late outcomes of open and endovascular thoracic aortic repairs in patients with ESRD. A total of 36 patients with ESRD who needed chronic haemodialysis undergoing open surgery (n = 21) or thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) (n = 15) of the thoracic aorta from 2007 to 2017 in our hospital were identified. Primary end points were in-hospital mortality and late survival; secondary end points were perioperative complications and late aortic events. Fourteen patients (39%) had aortic dissection, and 16 (44%) had aortic aneurysms. Emergency surgery was performed in 12 patients (33%). There were 3 hospital deaths (8%) (open surgery, n = 1, 5%; TEVAR, n = 2, 13%). The TEVAR group had fewer transfusions than the open surgery group and shorter intensive care unit and hospital stays. The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 79%, 58% and 40%, respectively, for patients overall. Freedom from aortic events at 1 and 3 years was 97% and 92%, respectively. The early outcome of thoracic aorta surgery in patients with ESRD was acceptable. However, the long-term mortality in patients with ESRD was still poor. Therefore, whether to perform surgery needs to be considered carefully."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is a surgical emergency which poses a challenge to numerous clinicians across different specialties due to its high rate of associated morbidity and mortalities. Acute type A aortic dissection, which involves the ascending aorta and beyond, is a lethal condition. It is therefore vital to understand the pathophysiology that underlies this condition and the tools that aid its early detection. Haemodynamics factors including lumen wall shear stress and pressure, geometrical factors as entry tear location and size, and the composition of the aortic wall are well known to affect the disease progression. The studies on these factors are well established in Type B aortic dissection but not clearly emphasised in the setting of acute type A aortic dissection. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of available literature on the relationship between tear size, location and the pressure of false lumen in acute type A aortic dissection."

We describe the results of malperfusion management after implantation of the Ascyrus Medical Dissection Stent (AMDS; Ascyrus Medical, Boca Raton, FL), an adjunct to current surgical aortic dissection repair. From March 2017 to January 2019, 47 consecutive patients (median age, 65 years; interquartile range, 15.8 years; 61.9% male) presented with acute DeBakey I aortic dissections and underwent emergent surgical aortic repair with AMDS implantation. Malperfusion was detected preoperatively in 55.3% (n = 26) of patients. Two patients were excluded from efficacy analysis due to lack of follow-up. Overall, 66 vessel malperfusions were identified, consisting of 1.5% (n = 1) coronary, 33.3% (n = 22) supraaortic, 21.2% (n = 14) visceral, 24.2% (n = 16) renal, and 15.1% (n = 10) extremities. Three patients (11.5%) had clinical evidence of paralysis at presentation. All 26 device implants were successful. In the malperfusion cohort, 30-day mortality was 7.7% (n = 2). A new neurologic deficit identified postoperatively in patients without neurologic symptoms preoperatively occurred in 7.7% (n = 2). During the follow-up period, 95.5% (n = 63) of vessel malperfusions had resolved without an additional procedure, including 95.5% (n = 21) supraaortic, 92.9% (n = 13) visceral, 93.8% (n = 15) renal, and 100% (n = 10) extremity. All patients with paralysis at presentation had complete resolution. The AMDS provides an effective single-stage malperfusion management strategy. In this study, dynamic malperfusion involving supraaortic, visceral, spinal cord, and lower extremities were treated concurrently with the index standard-of-care operation without delay in life-saving care."

    "abstract": "The association between pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm (PDAA) and local hemodynamic changes in pancreaticoduodenal arcades is well established. However, there are few case reports of PDAA associated with acute aortic dissection. In this article, we outline and discuss the case of a 61-year-old man diagnosed with a type A acute aortic dissection who underwent emergency surgery and developed sudden-onset severe abdominal pain and shock 10 days later. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a ruptured PDAA with feeding vessels from the gastroduodenal and superior mesenteric arteries, with evidence that the celiac artery was diverged from a false lumen. Transarterial embolization via the superior mesenteric artery alone was not expected to achieve hemostasis, so we performed a hybrid procedure involving transarterial embolization cannulated from superior mesenteric artery with complementary surgical ligation of the gastroduodenal artery. The postoperative course was uneventful, and follow-up contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed no persistence of the aneurysm 8 days after the second operation. This case proposed that visceral arterial malperfusion due to acute aortic dissection can cause PDAA in the early postoperative period. Although previous reports suggest that endovascular treatment is preferable, it may not always be feasible. Since ruptured PDAAs are often not detected during surgery, surgical treatment can be overly invasive. Whereas, transarterial embolization with complementary clamping or ligation of the gastroduodenal artery for ruptured PDAA is less invasive and can control hemorrhage, especially when cannulation to the celiac artery is impossible. Notably, the technique did not cause organ ischemia, presumably because the small collateral vessels of the pancreaticoduodenal arcades permitted sufficient blood flow. If endovascular treatment is unable to achieve rapid hemostasis, this technique may be a useful option for ruptured PDAA."

    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient diagnostic triage for acute chest pain (ACP) remains one of the most challenging problems in the emergency department (ED). While the proportion of patients that present with myocardial infarction (MI), aortic dissection, or pulmonary embolism is relatively low, a missed diagnosis can be life threatening. Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) has developed into a robust diagnostic tool in the triage of ACP over the past decade, with several trials showing that it can reliably identify patients at low risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, shorten the length of stay in the ED, and reduce cost associated with the triage of patients with undifferentiated chest pain. Recently, however, high-sensitivity troponin assays have been increasingly incorporated as a rapid and efficient diagnostic test in the triage of ACP due to their higher sensitivity and negative predictive value of myocardial infarction. As more EDs adopt high-sensitivity troponin assays into routine clinical practice, the role of CCTA will likely change. In this review, we provide an overview of CCTA and high-sensitivity troponins for evaluation of patients with suspected ACS in the ED. Moreover, we discuss the changing role of CCTA in the era of high-sensitivity troponins."

    "abstract": "Guidelines recommend chest radiography (CR) in the workup of suspected acute aortic syndromes (AASs) if the pretest clinical probability is low. However, the diagnostic impact of CR integration for the rule-in and rule-out of AASs is unknown. We performed a secondary analysis of the ADvISED multicenter study. Emergency department outpatients were eligible if an AAS was clinically suspected. Clinical probability was defined with the aortic dissection detection risk score (ADD-RS). CR was evaluated blindly by a radiologist, who judged on mediastinum enlargement (ME) and other signs. In 2014 through 2016, a total of 1,129 patients were enrolled and 1,030 were analyzed, including 48 (4.7%) with AASs. ADD-RS/ME and ADD-RS/any CR sign (aCRs) integration were more accurate than ADD-RS alone (area under the curve = 0.8 and 0.78 vs. 0.66, p < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of the integrated strategies were 66.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 51.5% to 79.9%) and 82.5% (95% CI = 79.9% to 84.8%) for ADD-RS/ME and 68.8% (95% CI = 53.6% to 80.9%) and 76.5% (95% CI = 73.7% to 79.1%) for ADD-RS/aCRs, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of CR per se were 54.2% (95% CI = 39.2% to 68.6%) and 92.4% (95% CI = 90.5% to 93.9%) for ME and 60.4% (95% CI = 45.3% to 74.2%) and 85.2% (95% CI = 82.9% to 87.4%) for aCRs. The agreement (κ) between attending physicians and radiologists for ME was 0.44 (95% CI = 0.35 to 0.54). ADD-RS/ME rule-in (ADD-RS ≤ 1 and ME-present, or ADD-RS > 1) applied to 204 versus 130 patients with ADD-RS > 1, including 14 with AAS and 60 false-positives (FP). ADD-RS/aCRs rule-in (ADD-RS ≤ 1 and aCRs-present, or ADD-RS > 1) applied to 264 patients, including 15 with AAS and 119 FP. ADD-RS/ME rule-out (ADD-RS ≤ 1 and ME-absent) applied to 826 (80.2%) patients, including 16 with AAS (33.3% of cases). ADD-RS/aCRs rule-out (ADD-RS ≤ 1 and aCRs-absent) applied to 766 patients (74.4%), including 15 with AAS (31.3% of cases). CR integration with clinical probability assessment showed modest rule-in efficiency and insufficient sensitivity for conclusive rule-out."

    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic dissection is an emergent life-threatening condition. Routine screening for genetic variants causing thoracic aortic dissection is not currently performed for patients or family members. We performed whole exome sequencing of 240 patients with thoracic aortic dissection (n=235) or rupture (n=5) and 258 controls matched for age, sex, and ancestry. Blinded to case-control status, we annotated variants in 11 genes for pathogenicity. Twenty-four pathogenic variants in 6 genes (COL3A1, FBN1, LOX, PRKG1, SMAD3, and TGFBR2) were identified in 26 individuals, representing 10.8% of aortic cases and 0% of controls. Among dissection cases, we compared those with pathogenic variants to those without and found that pathogenic variant carriers had significantly earlier onset of dissection (41 versus 57 years), higher rates of root aneurysm (54% versus 30%), less hypertension (15% versus 57%), lower rates of smoking (19% versus 45%), and greater incidence of aortic disease in family members. Multivariable logistic regression showed that pathogenic variant carrier status was significantly associated with age <50 (odds ratio [OR], 5.5; 95% CI, 1.6-19.7), no history of hypertension (OR, 5.6; 95% CI, 1.4-22.3), and family history of aortic disease (mother: OR, 5.7; 95% CI, 1.4-22.3, siblings: OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.1-23.9, children: OR, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.4-26.7). Clinical genetic testing of known hereditary thoracic aortic dissection genes should be considered in patients with a thoracic aortic dissection, followed by cascade screening of family members, especially in patients with age-of-onset <50 years, family history of thoracic aortic disease, and no history of hypertension."

    "abstract": "We report on a large series of patients treated at the S. Orsola Hospital, University of Bologna (Bologna, Italy) and Hannover Medical School (Hannover, Germany), with the aim to evaluate the early and midterm results. Between January 2007 and March 2017, 437 patients underwent total aortic arch replacement with the frozen elephant trunk technique. The frozen elephant trunk prostheses used were the custom-made Chavan-Haverich (Hanover, Germany) (n = 27, 6%), Jotec E-vita open (Jotec Inc, Hechingen, Germany) (n = 192, 44%), and Vascutek Thoraflex-Hybrid (Vascutek, Inchinnan, Scotland) (n = 218, 50%). The main indications were thoracic aortic aneurysm (n = 135, 31%), chronic aortic dissection (n = 182, 41.6%), and acute aortic dissection (n = 120, 27.5%). Overall in-hospital mortality was 14.9%, and permanent neurologic deficit and spinal cord injury were 10.8% and 5.5%, respectively. Patients with chronic aortic dissection presented a better in-hospital mortality rate than the thoracic aortic aneurysm and acute aortic dissection groups. Independent risk factors for mortality in the overall population were prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time, age, urgent/emergency surgery, and Marfan syndrome. The median (p25, p75) follow-up time was 2.6 (1.4-4.4) years, and the mortality rate was 7.01 (95% confidence interval, 5.7-8.7) per 100 patient-years. A total of 86 patients (23.1%) required an additional procedure during the follow-up; 61 (16.3%) required endovascular extensions, and 25 (6.7%) required aortic surgery. The frozen elephant trunk technique is a treatment option for all complex pathologies of the thoracic aorta. Patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms presented a higher mortality rate, and in patients with acute aortic dissection, the malperfusion syndrome still remains a catastrophic complication. The midterm follow-up showed satisfactory results in terms of survival and freedom from reintervention."

Often surgeons have to face different challenges, taking prompt decisions in emergency setting, during the pre- and intraoperative phase. Choosing if operate or not a patients with AAAD as well as the management of the dissected aortic arch can be challenging. Different factors need to be evaluated as: the patients age, the presence of organ malperfusion, the intimal tear location, and last but not least the surgeon personal experience in aortic surgery. During the last decade, different milestone steps have been achieved in aortic surgery as the antegrade perfusion of the aorta through different cannulation sites, open distal repair, antegrade selective cerebral perfusion, and systematic resection of the proximal intimal tear, allowing complex repair for dedicated team as well as simpler repair for not dedicated surgeons. We reviewed different scenarios and techniques used for the aortic arch replacement in patients with AAAD, taking into consideration that the aim of surgery is to save patients life."

    "abstract": "A 71-year-old male with history of DeBakey type-1 aortic dissection and repair with dacron graft three months prior to presentation was brought to the emergency room with complaints of high-grade fevers, chills, and shortness of breath. Chest X-ray revealed right lower lobe infiltrates and widened superior mediastinum. A follow-up CT chest with contrast showed fluid collection around the aortic graft. He was started on intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics, and a TEE was done for further evaluation of periaortic fluid collection which showed findings to suggest periaortic abscess. The patient underwent surgical drainage of the abscess and was found to have an abscess around the surgical aortic graft which was drained followed by two weeks of antibiotic treatment. The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility and remained asymptomatic at three-month follow-up appointment. Type-1 aortic dissection is a medical emergency requiring acute surgical intervention, and despite significant advancements in diagnosis and management, the immediate and long-term complications remain high leading to increased risk of mortality. Our patient developed spontaneous periaortic abscess three months postoperatively requiring intensive antibiotic therapy along with surgical drainage. Our case emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and management of late complications of periaortic abscess in patients with aortic dissection repair."

    "abstract": "Type A aortic dissection (TAD), which consists of an intimal tear in the aorta, necessitates emergency surgery. Various risk factors related to aortic dissection have been defined in the literature. According to our hypothesis, a narrower angle of ascending aortic curvature (AAAC) may be an additional risk factor in relation to aortic dissection due to the increased force applied to the aortic wall. Patients undergoing ascending aortic surgery due to an ascending aortic aneurysm (AsAA) (n = 105) and patients undergoing such surgery because of the occurrence of TAD (n = 101) were enrolled in this study. The AAAC was measured using Cobb's method; the measurements were made on all patients by just 1 cardiovascular radiologist using 3-dimensional computerized tomographic imaging. This measurement was made indirectly by using the aortic valve and brachiocephalic artery to avoid obtaining misleading data as a result of distortions due to dissection. A statistical comparison was also performed relating the traditional risk factors for TAD to other clinical and echocardiographic parameters: the diameter of the ascending aorta and the AAAC. The AAAC was found to be narrower statistically in the TAD group (α = 76.2° ± 17.5°) than it was in the AsAA group (α = 92.9° ± 13°) (P < 0.001). Furthermore, mean ascending aortic diameter (P = 0.019), the presence of a bicuspid aorta (P = 0.007) and aortic valve stenosis (P = 0.005) were higher in the AsAA group. According to multivariable analyses, a narrower AAAC is a significant predictor for the development of TAD (odds ratio 0.93, 95% confidence interval 0.91-0.95; P < 0.001). Overall hospital mortality from various causes including stroke, myocardial infarction, bleeding or renal failure was 13% in the TAD group and 7% in the AsAA group. According to this study, the AAAC was significantly smaller in aortic dissection patients than in aortic aneurysm patients. This may be related to higher shear stress and elevated pressure on the ascending aorta in patients with a narrower AAAC. Thus, a narrower AAAC may be an additional risk factor in the development of TAD. Therefore, we may need to be more careful in terms of looking for the development of aortic dissection in patients with narrower AAAC."

    "abstract": "Postoperative mortality after open and endovascular repair of thoracic aortic dissection (AD) has been the focus of previous research. However, a little has been published on the far less common isolated abdominal aortic dissection (IAAD). The aim of our study was to identify risk factors associated with 30-day postoperative mortality in patients with IAAD. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) was queried for patients who underwent open or endovascular AD repair from January 2010 to December 2015. Information regarding patient demographics, comorbidities, preoperative laboratory values, procedure details, and postoperative complications were analyzed, and predictors of 30-day mortality were identified. Risk stratification by the type of aortic repair and surgery setting was performed, and patient characteristics associated with mortality in each setting were determined. We employed chi-squared test, Student's t-test, and Mann-Whitney U test for the univariate analysis, while the multivariate analysis was performed using a stepwise binary logistic regression test. There were 229 patients who met the specified criteria, 15 died within 30 days postoperatively, and 214 survived beyond the same period (mortality rate was 6.5%). Among preoperative factors, a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), preoperative ventilator dependence, preoperative transfusion of ≥1 unit packed RBCs, emergent operation, and advanced American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class were associated with increased risk of mortality. Postoperative complications associated with a higher risk of mortality were acute kidney injury, mechanical ventilation ≥48 hours, unplanned intubation, myocardial infarction, septic shock, and blood transfusion. On multivariate analysis, risk factors independently associated with increased risk of mortality were a history of COPD (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 10.5; P = 0.013), postoperative acute renal failure (AOR, 12.8; P = 0.003) and septic shock (AOR, 15.3; P = 0.014). Multiple preoperative and postoperative factors are associated with a high risk of death after IAAD repair. A better control of COPD and prevention of postoperative acute renal failure and septic shock may result in better outcomes."

Over the past three decades, there has been considerable improvement in both the mortality and morbidity associated with these procedures. Herein, we describe our operative results and long-term outcomes in patients with chronic type B aortic dissections. Review of the aortic surgical database was conducted to identify all consecutive patients who underwent repair of TAAA for chronic type B dissection from May 1997 to March 2018. The primary end point was operative mortality with secondary end points as the composite of major adverse events as well as each of the individual complications. One hundred and fifty-three patients met inclusion criteria with 54.9% (84/153) having surgery on an elective basis. The mean age was 58.9 years with a majority of male gender-107/153 (69.9%). Eighty-three (54.2%) of the TAAA were extent I, while 36 (23.5%) were extent II and 34 (22.3%) extent III-IV. Operative mortality was 8.5% (13/153) with eight of the deaths in patients who presented with extent II TAAA. On Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, 87.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) 77.9-97.1%) of the elective cohort were alive after 5 years while only 69.9% (CI 55.2-84.6%) of those in need of urgent/emergency intervention survived (p = .039). In a majority of patients with chronic type B dissections, reproducibly, excellent outcomes can be achieved with relatively low risk of mortality. In the higher risk subsets of patients with extent II TAAA, careful consideration and discussion of expected outcomes will help inform the decision-making process."

Of these, 6 (11%) patients were diagnosed with a Crawford type I-II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA), 20 (35%) patients with Crawford type III-IV TAAA, 18 (32%) were diagnosed as having an aortic arch aneurysm (AAA) and descending thoracic aortic aneurysm (DTAA), 12 (22%) had DeBakey type I and IIIb aortic dissection. To protect the visceral organs and spinal cord from ischaemia in 28 (50%) cases we used a temporal bypass from a synthetic vascular graft with zero porosity and measuring from 15 to 20 cm in diameter. RESULTS: Mortality within 30 days amounted to 14.3% (n=8), that after 30 days amounted to 10.7% (n=6): in elective operations - 12% (n=5) and 5.4% (n=3), in emergency operations - 21% (n=3) and 21.4% (n=3), respectively. The total in-hospital mortality amounted to 25% (n=14), equalling 19% (n=8) and 43% (n=6) for elective and emergency operations, respectively. Mortality in using temporal bypass in elective operation amounted to 9.5% (n=2) during 30 days and that without using this method to 14.3% (n=3), after 30 days being 9.5% (n=2) and 4.7% (n=1), respectively. Mortality for emergency cases with a temporal shunt during 30 days was 28.6% (n=2), without - 14.3% (n=1), after 30 days - 28.6% (n=2), without - 14.3% (n=1). In type I-II TAAA mortality within 30 days was 16.6% (n=1), after 30 days - 50% (n=2); type III-IV TAAA - 10% (n=2) and 15% (n=1); DTAA - 22.2% (n=4) and 33.3% (n=2); aortic dissection - 8.3% (n=1) and 16.6% (n=1). Acute renal failure (ARF) occurred in 6 (10.7%) patients and was more often observed in the group without temporal shunting. Events of spinal cord ischaemia with the development of spinal stroke occurred in 6 (10.7%) cases. Five-year survival amounted to 61%. CONCLUSION: Temporal bypass in surgery of the thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta may be used for prevention of ischaemia of visceral organs, kidneys and spinal cord in operations accompanied by cross-clamping of the descending thoracic aorta.

Crawford, у 18 (32%) диагностировалась аневризма дуги (АДА) и нисходящей грудной аорты (АНГА), у 12 (22%) – расслоение аорты I и IIIb типов по M.E. DeBakey. Для защиты от ишемии внутренних органов и спинного мозга в 28 (50%) случаях использовался временный шунт из синтетического сосудистого протеза с нулевой порозностью диаметром от 15 до 20 мм. Результаты. Летальность до 30 дней составила 14,3% (n=8), после 30 дней – 10,7% (n=6): при плановых операциях – 12% (n=5) и 5,4% (n=3), при экстренных – 21% (n=3) и 21,4% (n=3) соответственно. Общая госпитальная летальность составила 25% (n=14), при плановых операциях – 19% (n=8), при экстренных – 43% (n=6). При использовании временного шунта при плановых операциях умерло 9,5% (n=2) в течение 30 дней, а без использования данного метода – 14,3% (n=3), после 30 дней – 9,5% (n=2) и 4,7% (n=1) соответственно. В экстренных случаях с временным шунтом погибло до 30 дней 28,6% (n=2), без – 14,3% (n=1), после 30 дней – 28,6% (n=2), без – 14,3% (n=1). При ТААА I–II типов погибло до 30 дней 16,6% (n=1), после 30 дней – 50% (n=2); TAAA III–IV типов – 10% (n=2) и 15% (n=1); АНГА – 22,2% (n=4) и 33,3% (n=2); расслоение аорты – 8,3% (n=1) и 16,6% (n=1). Острая почечная недостаточность (ОПН) развилась у 6 (10,7%) и чаще наблюдалась в группе без временного шунтирования. Явления ишемии спинного мозга с развитием спинального инсульта возникли в 6 (10,7%) случаях. Пятилетняя выживаемость составила 61%. Выводы. Временный шунт в хирургии грудной и торакоабдоминальной аорты может быть использован для профилактики ишемии висцеральных органов, почек и спинного мозга при операциях, сопровождающихся пережатием нисходящей грудной аорты."

    "abstract": "To explore the prognostic factors for permanent neurological dysfunction (PND) after total aortic arch replacement with regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2 ) monitoring. This retrospective study enrolled 98 type A aortic dissection aneurysm patients who underwent emergency total aortic arch replacement combined with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest and right axillary artery selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (SACP). Data such as age, gender, body mass index, preoperative coexisting disease, laboratory test results, intraoperative critical operation duration, and intraoperative rSO2 were collected, and the neurological prognoses in the hospital were recorded and grouped by severity. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed on the statistically significant differences between the groups to screen the predictors of postoperative neurological complications in these patients. Forty-two patients had postoperative neurological complications, among which there were 29 cases (29.6%) of transient neurological dysfunction, and 13 cases (13.3%) of PND. Multiple logistic regression results showed that advanced age, preoperative low platelet count, prolonged hemostasis time and lowest relative rSO2 to baseline (ΔrSO2 min) in each time period were risk factors for postoperative PND. The ROC curve measurement showed that the optimal cut-off value of ΔrSO2 min was 79.7%, and the area under the curve was 0.708 (95% confidence interval = 0.557-0.858), p = 0.016; the optimal cut-off value of ΔrSO2 min in SACP was 81.6%, and the area under the curve was 0.720 (95% confidence interval = 0.570-0.870), p = 0.011; the optimal cut-off value of ΔrSO2 min in cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was 80.8%, and the area under the curve was 0.697 (95% confidence interval = 0.554-0.840), p = 0.023. Intraoperative ΔrSO2 min that is lower than the basal level of about 80%, advanced age, preoperative low platelet count, and prolonged hemostasis time are predictors of PND after total aortic arch replacement."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AD) is a life-threatening condition most frequently seen in men with an average age >60 years. Risk factors include family history, hypertension and cigarette smoking. AD has been associated with methamephatamine and cocaine use but has not previously been associated with the use of marijuana. We report a case of an aortic dissection in a 56-year-old male that occurred while smoking marijuana. The patient had a family history significant for both aortic aneurysm and dissection. He developed crushing chest pain, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis shortly after smoking marijuana from a glass pipe called a \"bubbler\". His ECG was unremarkable as was his chest x-ray and initial labs. CT scan revealed an Aortic dissection from the aortic root to the internal iliac artery. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: The role of cannabis in cardiovascular disorders is complex and not completely understood. Acute chest pain associated with marijuana use typically raises concern for pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Marijuana has also been associated with hypertension and arrhythmias and has also been associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction. However a link between marijuana and acute aortic dissection has not been previously reported. As more states legalize medical and recreational marijuana use this is a timely and important consideration for Emergency physicians evaluating chest pain. Our goal is to document the temporal relationship of cannabis use and acute aortic dissection in a recent ED patient."

    "abstract": "We seek to assess the safety of total arch replacement with frozen elephant trunk for acute type A aortic dissection in respect to the risks of operative mortality, stroke, and paraplegia using an international multicenter registry (ARCH). The ARCH Registry database from 37 participating centers was analyzed between 2000 and 2015. Patients who underwent emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection treated by total arch replacement with or without frozen elephant trunk were included. Operative mortality, permanent neurologic deficits, and spinal cord injury were primary end points. These end points were analyzed using univariate and hierarchical multivariate regression analyses, as well as conditional logistic regression analysis and post hoc propensity-score stratification. A total of 11,928 patients were enrolled in the ARCH database, of which 6180 were managed with total arch replacement. A comprehensive analysis was performed for 978 patients who underwent total aortic arch replacement for acute type A aortic dissection with or without frozen elephant trunk placement. In propensity-score matching, there were no significant differences between total arch replacement and frozen elephant trunk in terms of permanent neurologic deficits (11.9% vs 10.1%, P = .59) and spinal cord injury (4.0% vs 6.3%, P = .52) For patients included in the post hoc propensity-score stratification, frozen elephant trunk was associated with a statistically significantly lower mortality risk (odds ratio, 0.47; P = .03). The use of frozen elephant trunk for acute type A aortic dissection does not appear to increase the risk of paraplegia in appropriately selected patients at experienced centers. The exact risk factors for paraplegia remain to be determined."

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the consecutive sequelae of children and adolescents with Marfan syndrome after primary cardiovascular surgical interventions and the long-term outcomes. A retrospective review of children with Marfan syndrome who underwent primary surgical intervention in childhood (<18 years) and sequential cardiovascular operations between July 1986 and September 2014 was undertaken. Thirty-six children (mean age 12.38 ± 4.4, range 0.62-17.14 years, at the first operation; 12 females) underwent a total of 97 sequential cardiovascular operations. Primary pathologies were annuloaortic ectasia, aortic root and ascending aorta aneurysm, aortic valve insufficiency, floppy mitral valve and midaortic syndrome. Initial operations were emergency in 2 and urgent and elective in 10 and 24 patients, respectively. Associated skeletal abnormalities were seen in 8. All underwent a second operation; 17 underwent a third operation; 6 had a fourth; and 2 had a fifth. The survival rate of children <13 years of age at the first operation compared to those who were older and male, was not statistically significant (P = 0.244). The cumulative survival rate based on age at first operation was 63.24 ± 0.16% at a mean follow-up period of 13.9 ± 6.8 (median 11.8, range 2-32.6) years. Patients with Marfan syndrome undergoing surgery during childhood needed sequential reinterventions. However, even with multiple consecutive surgeries, long-term outcome is deemed satisfactory."

    "title": "Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair on Zone 2 Landing for Type B Aortic Dissection.",
    "abstract": "Although thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is an effective treatment for both complicated and uncomplicated type B aortic dissection (TBAD), the occurrence of retrograde type A aortic dissection (RTAD) after TEVAR could be a disastrous complication. The aim of this study was to examine the safety of zone 2 TEVAR in the treatment of acute and subacute TBAD. A Relay stent graft (SG) was placed proximally beyond the left subclavian artery (LSA) as zone 2 TEVAR for complicated or uncomplicated TBAD. LSA was preserved by physician-modified fenestrated TEVAR (F-TEVAR) if anatomically possible or by surgical reconstruction of debranching TEVAR (D-TEVAR) if necessary. Otherwise, LSA was simply covered. Changes in the aortic diameters after TEVAR were evaluated using CT scanning. Between 2013 and 2017, 22 patients (mean age: 63 ± 14 years; 16 males) with TBAD were treated with zone 2 TEVAR. Emergency TEVAR was performed in 9 patients (41%) for complicated TBAD, and elective TEVAR was performed in 13 patients (59%) for uncomplicated TBAD in subacute phases. LSA was preserved in 16 patients via 15 F-TEVAR and 1 D-TEVAR and intentionally covered in 6 patients on emergency TEVAR. Elective TEVAR succeeded in the preservation of LSA flow in all patients (emergency 33% vs. elective 100%; P < 0.01). There were no TEVAR-related complications such as stroke, spinal cord ischemia, and RTAD. Thirty-day mortality was 0%. Aortic remodeling as the expansion of true lumen and shrinkage and complete thrombosed occlusion of false lumen were prominent at the level of SG placement 12 months after TEVAR. During the follow-up period, stent-induced new entry at the distal edge of the SG occurred in 1 patient (4%); however, there was no case of aorta-related mortality. Zone 2 TEVAR for acute and subacute TBAD might be promising for the prevention of RTAD."

    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass are both associated with development of postoperative acute kidney injury. In this study, we undertook to investigate the relationship between cardiopulmonary bypass time and postoperative acute kidney injury in patients undergoing thoracic aortic surgery for acute DeBakey Type I aortic dissection. All patients receiving thoracic aortic surgery for acute DeBakey Type I aortic dissection in Beijing Anzhen hospital from December 2015 to April 2017 were included. Cardiopulmonary bypass time was recorded during surgery. Acute kidney injury was defined based on the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria. A total of 115 consecutive patients were eventually analyzed. The overall incidence of acute kidney injury was 53.0% (n = 61). The average age was 47.8 ± 10.7 years; 74.8% were male. Mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 211 ± 56 min. In-hospital mortality was 7.8%. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that cardiopulmonary bypass time was independently associated with the occurrence of postoperative acute kidney injury after adjust confounding factors (odds ratio = 1.171; 95% confidence interval: 1.002-1.368; P = 0.047). Cardiopulmonary bypass time is independently associated with an increased hazard of acute kidney injury after thoracic aortic surgery for acute DeBakey Type I aortic dissection. Further understanding of the mechanism of this association is crucial to the design of preventative strategies."

Electrocardiogram revealed an acute inferior and posterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) demonstrated right ventricular akinesis consistent with infarction, and an intimal defect consistent with an aortic dissection. We determined that cardiothoracic surgery was indicated rather than left-heart catheterization and anticoagulation. Using POCUS we were able to immediately diagnose a dissection of the aortic arch and considerably alter treatment in a patient presenting with STEMI."

    "title": "Many Different Patterns under a Common Flag: Aortic Pathology in HIV-A Review of Case Reports in Literature.",
    "abstract": "Availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for HIV has prolonged life expectancy of patients but has also increased the incidence of non-AIDS comorbid conditions. Among these, there are cardiovascular diseases, and aortic involvement has been described in patients with HIV in the form of aortitis, aneurysms, or dissections. Our study aims to describe aortic pathology occurring in patients with HIV, focusing on clinical and surgical presentation, management, and outcome, through a review of cases published in literature. MEDLINE (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) database was reviewed for \"aortitis\" OR \"aortic aneurysm\" OR \"aortic dissection\" AND HIV. Research was restricted to English language. Only case reports were included. Data on patients' age, sex, traditional risk factors, timing from HIV diagnosis, pharmacological details, coinfection (syphilis, hepatitis C virus [HCV], and hepatitis B virus [HBV]), anatomical localization of lesion, presence of inflammatory involvement, rapid growing or rupture, and surgical treatment and outcomes were collected and summarized in tables. Forty articles (51 cases) were included in the study. The mean age of patients was 48.8 ± 8.3 years. Male sex was preponderant (43 cases, 84.3%). Among traditional risk factors, hypertension and smoking were the most frequently reported ones (14 and 13 cases, respectively), followed by vasculopathy involving other arterial districts, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and drug addiction. In 3 cases, HIV was diagnosed in the same time as aortic pathology, whereas in most cases, aortic event occurred after five years from HIV diagnosis. In 30.5% of cases for which data on pharmacologic management were available, no treatment or poor adherence was reported. Coinfection occurred in some cases (syphilis in 6, HCV in 5, and HBV in 3). As for anatomical involvement, isolated thoracic lesions were more frequent (24, 47.1%), followed by abdominal and thoracoabdominal lesions. The etiology ranged from bacterial mycotic aneurysms to tertiary syphilis, postsurgical complications, or atherosclerosis. In 3 cases, HIV vasculitis was directly suggested, and in another 2, no other potential etiology had been diagnosed through cultural tests. Open surgical treatment was carried out in 30 cases (58.8%), and in addition, 10 endovascular (19.6%) and 2 hybrid procedures were described. Inflammatory features occurred in 7 cases, and a rapid evolution of lesions in 6. In 9 cases (17.6%), rupture occurred. Mortality was reported in 8 cases (15.7%). Aortic pathology may occur in patients with HIV. The entanglement of different patterns of pathological involvement of the aortic wall, secondary to immune dysregulation, infectious process, or atherosclerotic damage that may co-occur in one single case, results in a very challenging management of the condition. Because of the increased life expectancy of patients and immigration from regions with both high HIV and coinfection prevalence, the incidence of aortic pathology could increase in the upcoming years, suggesting the urgent need for further studies to optimize management in these very complex cases."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a rare and potentially fatal condition that has been known to be missed in diagnoses. Our primary objective was to determine if the availability of 24-hour emergency department (ED) specialist coverage and an on-site computed tomography (CT) scanner reduced the rate of missed diagnoses of AAD. We selected records of patients diagnosed with dissection of the aorta from a hospital's discharge database and death register in the period of January 1998 to December 2014. AAD was defined as missed if imaging to diagnose AAD or a cardiology/cardiothoracic surgical consultation was not obtained in the ED. We compared the rates of missed diagnosis before and after the availability of 24-hour ED specialist coverage and an on-site CT scanner in the ED. Among 145 patients, 42 (29.0%) had a missed diagnosis. The proportion of missed AAD was lower in the post-implementation period compared to the pre-implementation period (20.0% vs. 37.3%, odds ratio [OR] 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.20‒0.89; p = 0.023). After adjusting for confounders, the difference remained significant (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.14‒0.70; p = 0.005). In the post-implementation period, concurrent signs of congestive cardiac failure (OR 33.51, 95% CI 1.42‒789.20; p = 0.024) and absence of a widened mediastinum on chest radiography (OR 11.52, 95% CI 1.37‒96.80; p = 0.029) were independent predictors of missed diagnoses. The availability of 24-hour ED specialist coverage and an on-site CT scanner improved the diagnosis of AAD in our study."

    "abstract": "Left subclavian revascularization has become an integral part of thoracic endovascular aortic repair to extend the proximal landing zone. This is most commonly achieved via carotid-subclavian bypass; however, this can be achieved via vessel transposition. All patients who had zone 2 thoracic endovascular aortic repairs without branched grafts from 2007 to 2018 were included in the study. The primary outcomes were adverse events, including operative mortality, paraplegia, left arm ischemia, and stroke. Multivariable regression analysis was performed for baseline characteristics associated with adverse events. A total of 58 patients underwent left subclavian artery transposition for zone 2 thoracic endovascular aortic repair coverage. Operative (30-day) mortality occurred in 3 patients (5.2%). The majority of patients were operated on under urgent (N = 25; 43.1%) or emergency (N = 12; 20.7%) status. Indications for thoracic endovascular aortic repair included aneurysmal disease (34.5%) and type B aortic dissection (chronic [13.8%]; acute [51.7%]). Major adverse events included paraplegia (N = 1; 1.7%), transient paraparesis (N = 3; 5.2%), and stroke (N = 2; 3.4%). Over a mean follow-up of 2.8 years, there were 5 deaths (8.6%). On multivariable analysis, prior stroke (odds ratio, 31.4; 1.95-506.72; P = .02) was an independent predictor of adverse events. Carotid-subclavian transposition offers patients a safe and effective method for left subclavian artery revascularization during thoracic endovascular aortic repair with zone 2 coverage with no increased operative risk and a low complication rate."

    "abstract": "Both aortic dissection and tension pneumothorax are conditions that require urgent treatments. However, the diagnosis of these emergencies is sometimes challenging because of various symptoms and difficulty obtaining their medical history due to severe conditions. Here, we present the case of a patient with type A aortic dissection associated with tension pneumothorax. This is the second report of such a case worldwide. A 61-year-old man presented to the emergency department with sudden-onset chest and back pain. Upon presentation, his blood pressure was 97/58 mmHg, oxygen saturation on room air was 96%, and respiratory rate was 28 breaths/min. His physical examination revealed no jugular venous distention; however, breath sounds over the left lung were diminished. Bedside chest radiography revealed left tension pneumothorax with mediastinal shift to the right. Needle and chest tube thoracostomies were performed; however, the patient's vital signs did not improve and reexpansion pulmonary edema developed following tube thoracostomy. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed type A thrombosed aortic dissection with bullae in the upper lobe of the left lung. Therefore, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit, conservatively treated, and discharged without any complications. In conclusion, type A aortic dissection may be associated with tension pneumothorax and should be considered if the patient's vital signs do not improve even after decompression of the tension pneumothorax."

    "abstract": "Background: To evaluate trends in frequency, mortality and treatment for non-traumatic vascular emergencies (VE) in the US. Methods: VE in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2005-2014) were identified. ICD-9 CM diagnosis and procedures codes captured six common VE. Results: 228,210,504 emergency admissions with 317,396 procedures for VE were estimated. Mean age was 67.8 years and were primarily men (56.1 %; p < 0.0001). The commonest VE was Acute Limb Ischemia (ALI) (82.4 %) followed by ruptured AAA (10.8 %) and Acute Mesenteric Ischemia (4.71 %). VE increased from 132.8 per 100,000 admissions in 2005 to 153.6 in 2014 (p < 0.001), with mortality decrease for all VE (13.8 % vs. 9.1 %; p < 0.0001). Length of stay decreased (median 8 vs. 7 days; p < 0.0001) but cost of care increased (median $ 25,443 vs. $ 29,353; p < 0.0001). Endovascular treatment increased overall for VE from 23.7 % in 2005 to 37.2 % in 2014 (p < 0.0001). Hospital mortality for VE decreased overall, except ruptured thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm with mortality decrease with endovascular treatment (34.3 vs. 11.1; p = 0.04) and mortality increase with open treatment (44.7 vs. 47.6; p = 0.06). ALI overall mortality decreased from 8.1 % to 5.7 % (p < 0.0001) due to reduced open surgical mortality from 9.6 % to 7.4 % (p < 0.0001); endovascular mortality did not improve over time (4.0 % vs. 3.4 %; p = 0.45). Hospital mortality also increased for endovascular treatment of ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysm (rTAA) from 14.9 % to 27.4 % (p = 0.0003) during this period. Conclusions: VE frequency increased with a decrease in overall mortality over time. Overall hospital stay has decreased but with an increase in the cost of care. Open surgical mortality for VE has also decreased overall, suggesting perioperative care improvements, with the exception of ruptured thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. Endovascular utilization for VE has significantly increased; associated with lower mortality for most VE, although an increase in hospital mortality after endovascular repair of rTAA was seen. This may be due to an increased implementation of endovascular repair for patients not previously eligible for surgery due to high risk. We recommend careful selection of patients for rTAA treatment as mortality has increased despite endovascular therapy and at an increased cost of care."

    "abstract": "Acute Type A aortic dissection (AAAD) is a surgical emergency. In patients with arch and descending aorta involvement (DeBakey Type I), a total aortic arch replacement with frozen elephant trunk (FET) could favor false lumen thrombosis and improve long-term results. The authors hereby present their experience with this technique in a single low-volume center, to assess whether the technique is feasible to treat such disease. From January 2011 to December 2016, 43 patients with AAAD were operated on in the authors' institution, which carries out 300 to 350 annual procedures. Among these, 12 patients with an intimal tear in the aortic arch and/or proximal descending aorta received a FET procedure (10 males, age 57 years). Concomitant procedures were aortic valve replacement (42%), Bentall (25%), and aortic valve repair (17%). Cardiopulmonary bypass, cardiac arrest, and circulatory arrest times were 235 ± 43, 171 ± 33, and 75 ± 20 minutes, respectively. The operative mortality was 16.7% (n = 2). Stroke and re-thoracotomy for bleeding occurred in 8% (n = 1) and 8% (n = 1), respectively. There was no spinal cord injury. Follow-up was 36.1 months. During follow-up, no patients died or required a reoperation on the downstream aorta. Although all patients were operated on in a low-volume center, the results with FET in AAAD are acceptable. Even though this technique demands high technical skills, it is a promising approach in patients with acute aortic dissection."

After excluding those patients who received deferred surgery for acute type A aortic dissection, 112 patients who received emergency surgery for the condition at our hospital from January 2011 to January 2018 were enrolled. These patients were divided into two groups, one consisting of the patients who were sent directly to our emergency department (group 1) and the other consisting of the patients who were transferred from another hospital after first being diagnosed with type A aortic dissection (group 2). The collected data included the patient demographics, clinical characteristics, operative findings and methods, postoperative outcomes, latest follow-up time, and most recent status. There were 59 patients in group 1 and 53 patients in group 2. Univariate analysis revealed that group 1 had significantly more patients with a previous stroke (p = 0.007). Moreover, the average length of time from receiving a computed tomography (CT) scan to entering the operating room (OR) was shorter for the group 1 patients (p < 0.001). However, except for the incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury (14.5% versus 33.3%, p = 0.024), there was no statistical difference between the groups in terms of the operative findings and outcomes, such as hypotension before cardiopulmonary bypass, hemopericardium, other complications, and survival rate. Multivariate analysis showed that the independent predictors of hospital mortality included age > 61.5 years (p = 0.017), respiratory rate upon admission > 18.5 breaths/minute (p = 0.046), and total bypass time > 265.6 minutes (p = 0.015). For the patients who survived to discharge, log-rank analysis demonstrated similar cumulative survival rates for the two groups (p = 0.62). Further multivariate analysis showed that the risk of death after discharge was associated with the interval between the CT scan and OR entry (hazard ratio = 0.97 per minute; 95% confidence interval, 0.950-0.998; p = 0.037). In this study, it was found that interhospital transfer did not influence the surgical outcomes of patients with acute type A aortic dissection. As such, it can be concluded that the transfer of the patients with type A aortic dissection to tertiary hospitals with experienced cardiac surgical teams may not increase the surgical risk."

    "abstract": "Type A aortic dissection is a highly lethal condition, which warrants swift open surgical intervention to prevent death by rupture or malperfusion. The aim is to resect the proximal intimal tear and realign the dissected wall layers. We describe two patients who recently presented in our center with a retrograde type A intramural hematoma and a clear intimal tear distal to the left subclavian artery, that were treated in emergency by endovascular means instead of open surgery, with satisfactory short-term and one-year follow-up results. In conclusion, in selected cases, less invasive thoracic endovascular aortic repair can treat retrograde type A intramural hematoma originating from an intimal tear distal to the left subclavian artery, with good one-year results."

    "abstract": "In patients with acute type A aortic dissection, the use of the frozen elephant trunk (FET) procedure with total arch replacement (TAR) has been indicated for emergency operations to obtain thrombosis of the distal false lumen (FL). However, data comparing the FET and the classical elephant trunk (CET) procedures, including the incidences of mortality, morbidity, spinal cord injury and aortic remodelling, have not yet been reported. The goal of this study was to compare the early outcomes of TAR with the FET and the CET procedures. The past 7 years of medical records of 323 patients with type A aortic dissection who underwent emergency surgery were reviewed retrospectively, and 148 patients who underwent TAR were shortlisted for the study. First, the patients were divided into 2 groups, the CET group (n = 115; age 65 ± 12 years) and FET group (n = 33; 67 ± 11 years), to compare the early operative outcomes, including mortality and morbidity. Second, 86 patients (CET 56; FET 30) fulfilling the inclusive criteria (inserted length of elephant trunk ≥5 cm, involvement of dissection at the descending aorta and sufficient computed tomographic evaluation at ≥6 months after the operation) were compared to evaluate the patency and diameter of the FL at each segment of the downstream aorta. The in-hospital mortality rate was 8.1% (12/148), without significant differences between the 2 groups (CET 8.7% vs FET 6.1%; P = 1). No spinal cord ischaemia was encountered in either group. The incidence of postoperative FL patency at the level of the left lower pulmonary vein was 30% in the FET group, which was significantly lower than that in the preoperative state (73%) and in the CET group (77%). The downsizing of the aortic diameter at the distal edge of the CET or the FET, the left lower pulmonary vein and the coeliac axis was significant in the FET group 6 months after TAR. According to our initial experience, the FET compared to the CET procedure showed comparable early complications and an advantage concerning FL thrombosis and aortic remodelling at early follow-up examinations."

Few case reports have presented normal telemetry findings in patients with cardiac arrest where a contrast enhanced CT scan of the chest was able to identify the diagnosis. The early recognition of a cardiac arrest whether by telemetry monitoring or CT scan is important to improve the clinical outcomes. This case report presents a patient who was hypertensive and unresponsive upon arrival to the emergency department. A chest CT scan to rule out aortic dissection showed no contrast in the pulmonary arteries, aorta, and the rest of the heart chambers although normal telemetry findings were present.

    "abstract": "To evaluate risk factors of surgical treatment of acute aortic dissection type A. Retrospective analysis included 100 patients with acute aortic dissection type A who underwent surgery in 2007-2017. Patients were divided into 2 groups: group I (survivors, n=79) and group II (unfavorable outcomes, n=21). Postoperative in-hospital mortality was 21% (21/100). Preoperative risk factors were cardiac tamponade (p=0.0001), aortic rupture (p=0.0001), impaired coronary blood flow (p=0.0001), renal malperfusion (p=0.0001). Prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass (156.1±37.9 min vs 205.7±91.2 min), surgery time (5.0±1.1 vs. 6.8±2.5 h, p=0.0009) and deep hypothermia (26.1±4.6 min vs 22.4±4.4 min) were the main intraoperative risk factors influencing surgical outcomes in patients who underwent aortic arch repair. Multiple organ failure (p=0.0001), sepsis (p=0.0007), severe postoperative bleeding (p=0.0010) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (p=0.0001) were the main predictors of advanced mortality in postoperative period. Timely surgical treatment in case of cardiac tamponade and aortic rupture is essential to improve survival in patients with acute aortic dissection. Advanced aortic repair including hemi- or total arch replacement should be comprehensively measured because such procedures may be followed by increased postoperative morbidity and mortality after emergency aortic surgery. Цель исследования - определить факторы риска, влияющие на результаты хирургического лечения у больных с острым расслоением аорты типа А. Материал и методы. В ретроспективное исследование вошли 100 пациентов, оперированных по поводу острого расслоения аорты типа А в период 2007-2017 гг. Больные разделены на две группы: 1-ю составили 79 выживших больных, 2-ю - 21 умерший пациент. Результаты. Послеоперационная летальность 21%. Предоперационными факторами риска были гемотампонада сердца (p=0,0001), разрыв аорты (p=0,0001), мальперфузия коронарных артерий (p=0,0001), мальперфузия почек (p=0,0001). Длительное искусственное кровообращение (156,1±37,9 мин против 205,7±91,2 мин), время операции (5,0±1,1 ч против 6,8±2,5 ч; p=0,0009), температурный режим гипотермии (26,1±4,6 °С против 22,4±4,4 °С) явились основными интраоперационными факторами риска, влияющими на результаты операции у больных, которым осуществляли одномоментную реконструкцию дуги аорты. Полиорганная недостаточность (p=0,0001), сепсис (p=0,0007), массивное послеоперационное кровотечение (p=0,0010) и диссеминированное внутрисосудистое свертывание (p=0,0001) послужили основными причинами неблагоприятного исхода в послеоперационном периоде. Выводы. Своевременное оперативное лечение при наличии гемотампонады и разрыва аорты имеет существенное значение в повышении выживаемости больных с острым расслоением аорты. Расширение объема оперативного вмешательства в виде частичной или даже полной замены дуги аорты должно быть взвешенным и аргументированным, так как стремление к радикализму при экстренных операциях у таких пациентов приводит к повышению уровня послеоперационных осложнений и летальности."

    "abstract": "We describe a unique case of an acute type B aortic dissection in a patient with a history of a previously placed infrarenal aortic stent for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The patient presented with a hypertensive emergency and left lower extremity ischemia, and imaging revealed complete collapse of the previously placed stent graft with extension into the iliac limbs. He underwent emergent endovascular intervention. When the false lumen was entered by puncturing the dissection plane with a sheath, immediate reexpansion of the stent graft was observed. The entry point of the dissection was covered with 2 overlapping stents, restoring flow within the true lumen. Although aortic stent collapse from acute type B aortic dissections is extremely rare, we demonstrate that endovascular release of the outflow obstruction and depressurizing the false lumen can resolve this dreaded complication."

We assessed whether abnormal orthostatic vital signs in the ED are associated with composite 30-day serious outcomes in older adults presenting with syncope. We performed a secondary analysis of a prospective, observational study at 11 EDs in adults ≥ 60 years who presented with syncope or near syncope. We excluded patients lost to follow up. We used the standard definition of abnormal orthostatic vital signs or subjective symptoms of lightheadedness upon standing to define orthostasis. We determined the rate of composite 30-day serious outcomes, including those during the index ED visit, such as cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, cardiac intervention, new diagnosis of structural heart disease, stroke, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, hemorrhage/anemia requiring transfusion, with major traumatic injury from fall, recurrent syncope, and death) between the groups with normal and abnormal orthostatic vital signs. The study cohort included 1974 patients, of whom 51.2% were male and 725 patients (37.7%) had abnormal orthostatic vital signs. Comparing those with abnormal to those with normal orthostatic vital signs, we did not find a difference in composite 30-serious outcomes (111/725 (15.3%) vs 184/1249 (14.7%); unadjusted odds ratio, 1.05 [95%CI, 0.81-1.35], p = 0.73). After adjustment for gender, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure (CHF), history of arrhythmia, dyspnea, hypotension, any abnormal ECG, physician risk assessment, medication classes and disposition, there was no association with composite 30-serious outcomes (adjusted odds ratio, 0.82 [95%CI, 0.62-1.09], p = 0.18). In a cohort of older adult patients presenting with syncope who were able to have orthostatic vital signs evaluated, abnormal orthostatic vital signs did not independently predict composite 30-day serious outcomes."

    "title": "[Aortic Intramural Hematoma: a Challenging Diagnosis].",
    "abstract": "A 75-year-old woman was admitted to our institution for acute abdominal pain. She had a history of atrial fibrillation, pacemaker implantation and diastolic heart failure. At time of admission, she was under oral anticoagulation therapy with apixaban. The X-ray of the chest showed a reduction in transparency surrounding the calcification of the aortic arch. CT angiography revealed evidence of an intramural hematoma of the aorta ranging from the left subclavian artery to the inferior mesenteric artery with presence of localized ulcer-like projections. Since the IMH was limited to the descending aorta, we first chose a conservative strategy with tight blood pressure control. Unfortunately, the patients' clinical symptoms did not improve. Her pain persisted despite medical treatment. After joint discussion with surgery and radiology, an endovascular aortic repair was successfully performed. The patient recovered well and could be discharged from the hospital. Acute aortic syndrome describes a life-threatening condition, including acute aortic dissection, intramural hematoma, and penetrating atherosclerotic aortic ulcer. Rapid and correct diagnosis is imperative for adequate management. Once the definitive diagnosis of an aortic syndrome is made, prompt and appropriate therapeutic interventions should be undertaken. Urgent surgery for acute aortic syndromes involving the ascending aorta (Stanford Type A) and medical therapy alone for uncomplicated cases involving the descending aorta (Stanford Type B) are typically recommended. In complicated Stanford Type B situations, endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) should be considered. Eine 75-jährige Patientin wurde wegen akuter Übelkeit, Völlegefühl, Erbrechen ohne Blutbeimengung und unspezifischer abdomineller Schmerzsymptomatik nächtlich aufgenommen. In der Anamnese fand sich neben einem Vorhofflimmern, weswegen sie vollantikoaguliert war, ein Z. n. Schrittmacheranlage sowie eine diastolische Herzinsuffizienz. Im Röntgenbild des Thorax fiel eine die Kalkspange des Aortenbogens umgebende Transparenzminderung auf. Eine CT-Angiografie erbrachte den Nachweis eines intramuralen Hämatoms (IMH) der Aorta vom Abgang der A. subclavia links bis nach abdominell zum Abgang der A. mesenterica inferior mit fokalen Ulzerationen. Da sich das IMH auf die Aorta descendens beschränkte, wurde zunächst ein konservatives Vorgehen mit blutdrucksenkenden Maßnahmen gewählt. Die Beschwerdesymptomatik der Patientin verbesserte sich trotz medikamentöser Therapie nicht. Aufgrund des komplizierten Verlaufs wurde nach interdisziplinärer Fallbesprechung eine transfemorale endovaskuläre Reparatur der Aorta mittels Stentgraft-Prothese durchgeführt. Postinterventionell erholte sich die Patientin gut von dem Eingriff, war beschwerdefrei und konnte entlassen werden. Entscheidend für das Management eines IMH ist eine zeitnahe Diagnose und die korrekte Klassifizierung der Ausdehnung (Typ Stanford A oder Stanford B). Während für ein IMH Typ Stanford A die Indikation zur chirurgischen Versorgung gegeben ist, ist bei Typ Stanford B eine interdisziplinäre Falldiskussion sinnvoll. Bei Vorliegen eines unkomplizierten IMH ist ein konservatives Prozedere mit adäquater Einstellung einer arteriellen Hypertonie empfohlen. Bei komplizierten Verläufen sollte die endovaskuläre Therapie (Thoracic Endovascular Repair/TEVAR) als Versorgungsmöglichkeit erwogen werden."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic syndrome (AAS) comprises a range of interrelated conditions caused by disruption of the medial layer of the aortic wall, including aortic dissection, intramural haematoma and penetrating aortic ulcer. Since mortality from AAS is high, a prompt and accurate diagnosis using imaging techniques is paramount. Both transthoracic (TTE) and transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) are useful in the diagnosis of AAS. TTE should be the first imaging technique to evaluate patients with thoracic pain in the emergency room. Should AAS be suspected, contrast administration is recommended when images are not definitive. TEE allows high-quality images in thoracic aorta. The main drawback of this technique is that it is semi-invasive and the presence of a blind area that limits visualisation of the distal ascending aorta near. TEE identifies the location and size of the entry tear, secondary communications, true lumen compression and the dynamic flow pattern of false lumen. Although computed tomography (CT) is the most used imaging technique in the diagnosis of AAS, echocardiography offers complementary information relevant for its management. The best imaging strategy for appropriately diagnosing and assessing AAS is to combine CT, mainly ECG-gated contrast-enhanced CT, and TTE. Currently, TEE tends to be carried out in the operating theatre immediately before surgical or endovascular therapy and in monitoring their results. The aims of this review are to establish the current role of echocardiography in the diagnosis and management of AAS based on its advantages and limitations."

    "abstract": "Background: Acute aorta dissection (AD) is a fatal emergency, however, studies addressing the clinical characteristics, management, and outcome of acute AD in young adult patients aged under 45 years in China are very few.Methods: A retrospective study including 490 patients with acute AD as the final diagnosis was conducted. Patients' demographics, clinical characteristics, medical history, and laboratory and diagnostic imaging findings were retrieved from medical records. Results: The median age of young adult patients with acute AD was 38 years old with an interquartile range from 33 to 41. Male and smoker constituted 84.49% and 50.61% of the cohort, respectively. Hypertension was found in 54.49%, while Marfan syndrome was seen in 4.29% of the patients. Abrupt onset of chest or back pain was the most common symptoms (85.31%), while altered consciousness, coma and oliguria were less reported. Most patients (89.39%) were managed with surgical interventions. Typical complications (central nervous system complications, spinal cord ischemia, myocardial ischemia/infarction, mesenteric ischemia/infarction and acute renal failure) were seen in a small portion of treated patients during perioperative period. For in-hospital mortality there were 24 (∼5%) cases recorded. Correlation analysis indicated that perioperative complications were associated with the length of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (P < 0.0001), and mortality after surgery correlated history of prior cardiac surgery (P = 0.043). Conclusion: CPB and prior cardiac surgery were associated with perioperative complications and mortality after surgery, respectively. The findings are valuable to the further refinement of diagnosis and surgical management of patients with acute aortic dissection."

Trained reviewers' extracted data using a standardized data collection form. The definitions of 5 pain characteristics - character, onset, duration, quality, and radiation were defined a priori. Data were collected for 194 cases of acute aortic dissection with a mean age of 65(SD 14.1) and 66.7% male, 34(17.6%) missed on initial presentation. Only 20(14.8%) patients were asked all 5 questions. The most common initial incorrect diagnosis were acute coronary syndrome (16, 47%), pulmonary embolism (5, 14.7%) and stroke (4, 11.7%). If <2 questions were asked 1 in 5 cases were missed, 4 times greater than if >2 were asked (P < 0.01).

We sought to examine spinal cord deficit after open extent II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair to identify predictors of the most serious type: persistent paraplegia or paraparesis. We included 1114 extent II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repairs performed from 1991 to 2017. Intercostal/lumbar artery reattachment (n = 959, 86.1%) and cerebrospinal fluid drainage (n = 698, 62.7%) were used to mitigate the risk of postoperative spinal cord deficit. We used univariate and multivariable analyses to examine spinal cord deficit and identify predictors of persistent paraplegia or paraparesis, defined as paraplegia or paraparesis present at the time of early death or hospital discharge. Spinal cord deficit developed after 151 (13.6%) repairs: 86 (7.7%) cases of persistent paraplegia or paraparesis (51 paraplegia; 35 paraparesis) and 65 (6.1%) cases of transient paraplegia or paraparesis. Patients with spinal cord deficit were older (median 68 vs 65 years, P < .001) and had more rupture (6.6% vs 2.2%, P = .002) and urgent/emergency repair (25.2% vs 16.9%, P = .01) than those without. Persistent paraplegia or paraparesis developed immediately in 47 patients (4.2%) and was delayed in 39 patients (3.5%). Urgent/emergency repair (relative risk ratio, 2.31; P = .002), coronary artery disease (relative risk ratio, 1.80, P = .01), and chronic symptoms (relative risk ratio, 1.76, P = .02) independently predicted persistent paraplegia or paraparesis. Reattaching intercostal/lumbar arteries (relative risk ratio, 0.38, P < .001) and heritable disease (relative risk ratio, 0.36, P = .01) were protective. Early and late survival were poorer in those with persistent paraplegia or paraparesis than in those without. Spinal cord deficit after extent II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repairs remains concerning; survival is worse in patients with persistent paraplegia or paraparesis. The complexity of spinal cord deficit and persistent paraplegia or paraparesis warrant further study."

    "abstract": "We compared early and late outcomes of patients who underwent femoral versus axillary artery cannulation for repair of acute type A aortic dissection. Between 2004 and 2017, we retrospectively evaluated the clinical outcomes of 135 consecutive patients who underwent emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection repair. Patients were divided into 2 groups: those who underwent femoral ( n = 84) and those who underwent right axillary ( n = 51) artery cannulation. Mean patient age was 63 ± 13 years and 88 (65%) were male. Overall operative mortality was 12.6% (axillary 15.7%, femoral 10.7%; P = 0.564). Patients who underwent axillary compared to femoral artery cannulation had a statistically nonsignificant higher operative mortality rate among both stable and unstable patients (13% vs. 6.5%, P = 0.405 and 40% vs. 22.7%, P = 0.818, respectively). While there was no difference in major complication rates, such as stroke, low cardiac output, and surgical revision for bleeding/tamponade, there was a higher incidence of renal failure that required dialysis in patients who underwent axillary cannulation (12% vs. 1%, P = 0.022). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that predictors for the composite endpoint of operative mortality or severe organ malperfusion, such as renal failure or cerebrovascular accident, were hemodynamic instability on admission (OR 3.87; 95% CI, 1.23 to 12.63; P = 0.021), lower preoperative creatinine clearance (OR 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90 to 0.97; P < 0.001); and the use of axillary artery cannulation (OR 4.1; 95% CI, 1.43 to 12.78; P = 0.011). Among those discharged from hospital, the 3-year survival rate was 91% in the axillary group and 87% in the femoral group ( P = 0.772). Based on our experience, emergent surgery for both stable and unstable patients with acute type A aortic dissection demonstrated similar survival rates and significantly less renal impairment when using the femoral cannulation approach."

Most of the cases occur during the third trimester of pregnancy, whilst 33% of cases are reported during the postpartum period. We report the case of a multiparous 35-year-old patient with gestational hypertension treated for a type A aortic dissection on the second postpartum day. A review of literature on non-syndromic sporadic aortic dissection during the postpartum period is presented. Aortic complications in pregnancy have been described in genetic syndromes or congenital aortic malformations but may also be non -syndromic and occur in the absence of any other risk factor. Pregnancy carries a 25-fold increase in relative risk for dissection. A review of the 16 cases published in literature from 1995 to December 2016 of non-syndromic, sporadic aortic dissections in pregnancy showed that the event may occur more frequently in the first week post-partum, be symptomatic for thoracic pain or dyspnoea. Type A aortic dissection accounts to 75% of cases. Mortality, despite surgical treatment, has been reported in 4 cases. Even though rarely reported, given the increasing incidence and the high mortality of aortic dissection in pregnancy, along with the potential challenge for two lives, clinician must consider aortic dissection in post-partum while dealing with differential diagnosis in post-partum patients in the emergency setting."

    "title": "Handmade stent graft fenestration to preserve left subclavian artery in thoracic endovascular aortic repair†.",
    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a handmade fenestrated stent graft over an aortic stent graft for preserving the left subclavian artery (LSA) in thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). From July 2015 to October 2018, a total of 32 consecutive patients with various thoracic aortic pathologies who underwent TEVAR in which handmade fenestration over a thoracic aortic stent graft was used for LSA were included. Outcomes including technical success, procedure-related complications, perioperative mortality and morbidity and graft patency were analysed. Twenty-four patients (75.00%) presented with aortic dissection, 5 patients (15.63%) with thoracic aortic aneurysm and 2 patients (6.25%) with penetrating aortic ulcer; 1 patient (3.13%) required re-TEVAR due to endoleak and sac expansion from previous TEVAR for thoraco-abdominal aneurysm. TEVAR was performed in a zone 2 landing with single fenestration for LSA (26 patients, 81.25%), zone 1 landing with double fenestration for both LSA and left common carotid artery (5 patients, 15.63%) or zone 1 landing with single fenestration for LSA and a chimney graft for left common carotid artery (1 patient, 3.13%). The technical success rate, defined as the successful alignment of fenestration to LSA, was 93.75%. At a mean follow-up of 17.3 months, 4 cases of endoleak and 2 cases of stent graft-induced new entry were noted, 3 of which were treated endovascularly. Our preliminary results demonstrate the viability of preserving LSA blood flow in TEVAR using a handmade stent graft fenestration to treat various aortic pathologies in various clinical situations and the technical feasibility and short-term results that may justify the use of this method in emergency cases."

    "abstract": "Aortic bare-metal stent rupture is an exceptional complication, associated with high risk of aorta rupture and death. We describe a successful endovascular approach for a symptomatic aortic bare-metal stent fracture after the provisional extension to induce complete attachment (PETTICOAT) technique. A 53-year-old man with a complicated type B aortic dissection (visceral malperfusion) was treated with thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) and \"PETTICOAT\" technique. The 1-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up scans showed progressive aortic remodeling. After 15 months from the initial procedure, the patient was admitted to the emergency department with severe thoracic pain and two syncopal episodes. Urgent angio-computed tomography (CT) showed bare-metal stent rupture and aortic dilatation to 45 mm at the site of stent fracture. He was urgently treated with TEVAR to cover the entire length of the bare-metal stent under local anesthesia and motor-evoked potential (MEP) monitoring. If signs of medullary ischemia are observed in the MEP register, a carotid-subclavian bypass was planned. At 12 months of follow-up, the patient remains asymptomatic. CT scan at 1 month and 12 months showed no signs of endoleak and aortic remodeling to 40 mm. Although unusual, this case demonstrates the possibility of material fatigue/failure and highlights the need of close imaging follow-up after TEVAR for treatment of aortic diseases."

    "title": "Improving Provider Adoption With Adaptive Clinical Decision Support Surveillance: An Observational Study.",
    "abstract": "Successful clinical decision support (CDS) tools can help use evidence-based medicine to effectively improve patient outcomes. However, the impact of these tools has been limited by low provider adoption due to overtriggering, leading to alert fatigue. We developed a tracking mechanism for monitoring trigger (percent of total visits for which the tool triggers) and adoption (percent of completed tools) rates of a complex CDS tool based on the Wells criteria for pulmonary embolism (PE). We aimed to monitor and evaluate the adoption and trigger rates of the tool and assess whether ongoing tool modifications would improve adoption rates. As part of a larger clinical trial, a CDS tool was developed using the Wells criteria to calculate pretest probability for PE at 2 tertiary centers' emergency departments (EDs). The tool had multiple triggers: any order for D-dimer, computed tomography (CT) of the chest with intravenous contrast, CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA), ventilation-perfusion scan, or lower extremity Doppler ultrasound. A tracking dashboard was developed using Tableau to monitor real-time trigger and adoption rates. Based on initial low provider adoption rates of the tool, we conducted small focus groups with key ED providers to elicit barriers to tool use. We identified overtriggering of the tool for non-PE-related evaluations and inability to order CT testing for intermediate-risk patients. Thus, the tool was modified to allow CT testing for the intermediate-risk group and not to trigger for CT chest with intravenous contrast orders. A dialogue box, \"Are you considering PE for this patient?\" was added before the tool triggered to account for CTPAs ordered for aortic dissection evaluation. In the ED of tertiary center 1, 95,295 patients visited during the academic year. The tool triggered for an average of 509 patients per month (average trigger rate 2036/30,234, 6.73%) before the modifications, reducing to 423 patients per month (average trigger rate 1629/31,361, 5.22%). In the ED of tertiary center 2, 88,956 patients visited during the academic year, with the tool triggering for about 473 patients per month (average trigger rate 1892/29,706, 6.37%) before the modifications and for about 400 per month (average trigger rate 1534/30,006, 5.12%) afterward. The modifications resulted in a significant 4.5- and 3-fold increase in provider adoption rates in tertiary centers 1 and 2, respectively. The modifications increased the average monthly adoption rate from 23.20/360 (6.5%) tools to 81.60/280.20 (29.3%) tools and 46.60/318.80 (14.7%) tools to 111.20/263.40 (42.6%) tools in centers 1 and 2, respectively. Close postimplementation monitoring of CDS tools may help improve provider adoption. Adaptive modifications based on user feedback may increase targeted CDS with lower trigger rates, reducing alert fatigue and increasing provider adoption. Iterative improvements and a postimplementation monitoring dashboard can significantly improve adoption rates."

    "title": "Nasogastric Tubes Can Cause Intramural Hematoma of the Esophagus.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Intramural hematoma of the esophagus (IHE), a rare manifestation of acute mucosal injuries of the esophagus, can be caused by trauma such as endoscopic surgeries. Coagulation disorders increase the risk of IHE. The most common location of IHE is in the distal esophagus. The characteristic clinical triad of manifestations comprises acute retrosternal pain, odynophagia or dysphagia, and hematemesis. It is important to distinguish IHE from other acute conditions such as acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism. CASE REPORT An 84-year-old male was scheduled for coil embolization for an endoleak after endovascular aneurysm repair. For this reason, he was taking aspirin and warfarin. A nasogastric tube had been inserted during surgery and subsequently removed without any problems reported. Postoperatively, he experienced chest pain and hematemesis of sudden onset. Urgent esophagogastroduodenoscopy demonstrated a large, dark red, non-pulsatile, submucosal, esophageal mass in the area of the mid-esophagus with a little oozing. He was diagnosed as having an IHE; other possible diagnoses were excluded by contrast-enhanced computed tomography and aortography. He was treated with fasting, a proton pump inhibitor, and cessation of anti-thrombotic drugs; he recovered completely. The bleeding spot in the esophagus was in the area of the mid-esophagus, which was around the second natural constriction site. It was possible that the nasogastric tube had contact with the esophageal wall at this second natural constriction, and caused intramural esophageal bleeding. CONCLUSIONS Nasogastric tubes are not generally recognized as a cause of IHE. However, they can cause them, especially when a patient is taking anti-thrombotic drugs."

We present a very rare case of Stanford type A acute aortic dissection associated with ARLBV. A 70-year-old man was referred to our hospital complaining of worsening back pain and chest pain. Computed tomographic angiogram showed Stanford type A acute aortic dissection from the ascending aorta to the distal abdominal aorta. Furthermore, systemic venous anomalies were revealed. The left brachiocephalic vein coursed the left side of the aortic arch, anterior to the central pulmonary artery, and posterior to the ascending aorta, and joined the right brachiocephalic vein. Replacement of the ascending aorta was performed in an emergency, and the postoperative course was uneventful."

    "abstract": "Retrograde type A dissection (RTAD) is a serious complication after ascending aorta involved endovascular repair (AAIER). We here report our surgical approach to this serious complication. From July 2011 to July 2014, 8 RTADs after AAIER patients received surgical repair in our institution. Data of these RTAD patients were retrospectively collected for further analysis. All patients received urgent surgical repair based on the stented elephant trunk technique. We took 2 different ways to handle the previous stent during operation. In patients who had a prior hybrid aortic repair, we removed the proximal part of the stent while the distal part was left in place. In patients who had prior ascending aorta stent implantation (AASI), the stent was totally removed. The mean age of the patients was 57.6 ± 11.9 years. Regarding the index intervention, 2 patients received hybrid aortic repair and 6 patients received AASI. In patients who received AASI, 1 patient underwent simultaneous thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) and another patient received simultaneous chimney technique in innominate artery and left common carotid artery combined with bypass from left subclavian artery to left common carotid artery to cure the type I endoleak induced by the previous implanted TEVAR stent. All patients received a new elephant trunk implantation during surgical repair. The mean cardiopulmonary bypass, selective cerebral perfusion, and aortic cross-clamp time were 172.1 ± 13.3, 40.8 ± 4.2, and 121.8 ± 11.4 min, respectively. The mean intensive care unit time was 7.8 ± 3.4 days. Two patients (25.0%) experienced transient neurologic dysfunction and recovered completely before discharge. In-hospital death rate was 12.5% (1 of 8). The mean follow-up time was 17.1 ± 9.5 months. No late deaths or complications occurred during follow-up. AAIER especially AASI used in aortic dissection treatment should be seriously considered since RTAD might occur. Our study indicated that surgical repair with stented elephant trunk was feasible and according to the cause of RTAD, different surgical strategies should be taken to manage the stent."

Protection of collateral network branches that contribute blood supply to spinal cord is fundamental in the prevention of this catastrophic condition. We report the case of a patient who underwent emergent endovascular treatment for a type B aortic dissection complicated by rupture of the false lumen, with intentional coverage of the left subclavian artery without revascularization. The patient developed paraplegia on the 10th postoperative day, which did not significantly improve with immediate cerebrospinal fluid drainage but fully recovered after urgent left carotid-subclavian bypass."

    "abstract": "Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has emerged as a safe procedure in the treatment of a wide spectrum of descending thoracic aortic pathologies, with satisfactory results both in elective and urgent settings. We investigated the results of our elective, urgent and emergency TEVAR interventions. A single-centre retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients undergoing TEVAR from 2010 to 2016 was performed. Primary end point of the study was early mortality, whereas the secondary end points included major complications according to the urgency of the procedure. The analysis was further conducted comparing symptomatic, asymptomatic and ruptured cases. Two hundred and eight patients were treated with TEVAR between January 2010 and April 2016 (mean age 67 ± 12 years, 142 men, 68.3%). Patients undergoing TEVAR as a first-stage procedure for complex thoraco-abdominal repair were excluded. The indication for treatment was a dissection in most cases (n = 92, 44.2%; acute dissection in 40 cases, 19.2%), followed by thoracic aneurysms (n = 64, 30.8%), penetrating aortic ulcers (n = 37, 17.8%), intramural haematomas (n = 8, 3.8%), traumatic ruptures (n = 3, 1.4%) and other indications (n = 4, 1.8%). One hundred and eight procedures were performed electively and 100 urgently. Forty-three patients were treated on an emergency bas for aortic rupture, 44 urgently for thoracic pain and 13 for acute ischaemic complications of aortic dissection or other indications. Ischaemic complications of dissection included 1 case of mesenteric ischaemia, 3 cases of acute renal failure, 4 cases of limb ischaemia and multiple ischaemic complications in 4 cases. Other causes of urgent TEVAR included 1 patient bleeding from a bronchial artery treated with TEVAR after several embolization attempts. In-hospital mortality was 7.7%, significantly higher in the urgent setting (14% vs 1.9%, P = 0.001). Urgent procedures were also more frequently associated with major adverse clinical events (7.4% vs 26%, P = 0.0003) and specifically with paraplegia (2.8% vs 10%, P = 0.043). Perioperative mortality was significantly higher in the ruptured group compared to the symptomatic group (25.6% vs 2.3%, P = 0.002). When the analysis was conducted to compare the symptomatic and the asymptomatic patients, no differences in terms of perioperative mortality were detected. TEVAR is an effective treatment strategy in thoracic aortic disease. Though emergency repair of the ruptured thoracic aorta still shows high rates of perioperative mortality and morbidity, symptomatic non-ruptured and asymptomatic patients have comparable early outcomes."

    "abstract": "Endovascular aneurysm sealing (EVAS) was developed with the intention of expanding the anatomical limitations of conventional endovascular aneurysm repair devices and decrease rates of reintervention secondary to migration and type II endoleaks in treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms.1 Since its inception, EVAS has gained much popularity especially for patients with concomitant common iliac aneurysms, with good long-term durability suggested by several studies. Currently, the known complications of EVAS, while considered uncommon, include endoleaks, renal artery, and limb thrombosis.2 This report emphasizes the importance of vigilance in terms of early recognition of unusual complications after EVAS and describes the successful management of type B aortic dissection after EVAS, which is a novel complication of EVAS not previously described. We describe a rare case of type B aortic dissection after EVAS and discuss the possible causes. After diagnosis of progressive type B aortic dissection after EVAS, patient underwent emergency thoracic endovascular aortic repair with carotid to subclavian bypass for the aortic dissection with good results. He was discharged well with return to his baseline function. Aortic dissection is a potentially catastrophic complication of EVAS and with prompt recognition and monitoring, adverse complications may be averted."

    "abstract": "The treatment of type A acute aortic dissection is a challenge for the surgeon, and serious late complications may occur even after surgical repair. We report treatment after a type A postdissection thoracoabdominal aneurysm in a patient who previously underwent ascending aortic reconstruction using a biological aortic valve and Dacron prosthetic graft implantation in emergency conditions. The multistaged approach involved removing the right kidney and performing a heterotopic autotransplantation in the left iliac fossa before positioning a fenestrated endograft (celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, and left renal artery). The final step should have been the implantation of an aorto-bifurcated endograft, which, however, was postponed because the patient was injured during rehabilitation therapy. After 12 months, the computed tomography angiography scan showed complete thrombosis of the false lumen associated with large iliac entry tear closure and aortic diameter stability. These findings prompted us to desist from completing the aorto-bi-iliac implantation. This case demonstrates that in selected patients in whom treatment of a postdissection thoracoabdominal aneurysm with fenestrated endoprosthesis requires a challenging revascularization of the renal artery, a heterotopic kidney transplant using a mini-invasive technique may represent a viable and sufficiently safe alternative that guarantees renal blood perfusion."

After initial physical and ultrasound examination, the multislice computed tomography (MSCT) scan revealed infrarenal aortic aneurysm of 6 cm in diameter, 10 cm long, along with slightly dilated iliac arteries. However, dimensions of aortic root, aortic arch, and descending suprarenal aorta were within normal limits. Further on, because the patient presented with signs of impending rupture, an urgent surgical intervention was performed. The patient was discharged in good general medical condition 7 days after surgery. After 6 months of follow-up, the patient's condition was satisfying and no MSCT signs of further aortic dissection/aneurysm were identified. To the best of our knowledge, a case of successful management of a patient with Marfans syndrome and truly isolated infrarenal and symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm has not been described in the literature before."

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms are defined as vascular dilatations greater than 50% of the normal proximal segment or those that have a maximum diameter above 3 cm. Risk factors include male gender, age over 75 years, history of vascular pathology, hypertension and arteriosclerosis. The Authors describe a case of a 74-year-old man, evaluated in an emergency setting for right lumbar pain lasting 4 days. The pain did not respond to analgesia and became progressively worse. Due to the severity of symptoms, CT angiography was performed, which showed an active rupture of a partially contained aneurysm associated with aortic dissection. Early diagnosis and timely management of aortic aneurysms are essential in preventing complications, namely rupture (50-83% patients die after rupture and before receiving medical care). Acute aortic dissection is a surgical emergency and the risk of rupture is proportional to the size of the aneurysm and its rate of growth. This article shows how difficult it is sometimes to make the right diagnosis in an emergency department.Although a very common symptom, low back pain should not be regarded as harmless."

    "abstract": "Type A aortic dissection is a surgical emergency with a high morbidity and mortality. Strokes occur in up to 25% and are among the most feared complications. This study aims to evaluate factors linked to stroke development and the implications of strokes on outcomes. Patients from 2000-2014 were stratified based on the development of stroke. Factors were compared between the groups using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables, and independent two-group t-tests for continuous variables. Impact on survival at 30 days, 1 and 5 years were evaluated using the life-test method. Two hundred patients were analyzed. Forty (20%) developed a stroke. Preoperative factors associated with stroke were female gender (34% vs. 14% P=0.01), presentation with shock (32% vs. 17%; P=0.035), and history of stroke (64% vs. 17%; P<0.001). Femoral cannulation was the only technical variable associated with stroke (49% vs. 32%; P=0.035). Stroke patients had a higher rate of pneumonia (41% vs. 11%; P<0.001), respiratory failure (36% vs. 7%; P<0.001), hemodialysis requirement (38% vs. 16%; P=0.015), and longer hospital stay (23.9±17.8 days vs. 16.1±13.5 days; P=0.012). Stroke was associated with a lower survival probability at 30 days (0.73 vs. 0.89), 1 year (0.56 vs. 0.78), and 5 years (0.29 vs. 0.70) (P<0.001). Patients who developed stroke after type A dissection repair had higher complication rates and a higher mortality rate at 30 days, 1 year, and 5 years. Femoral cannulation was the only technical factor associated with a higher rate of strokes."

    "abstract": "We performed antegrade thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair via the ascending aorta in selected high-risk patients scheduled for open surgery, in whom an iliofemoral or abdominal aortic approach was not feasible. We present our initial experience with this approach. Of 16 consecutive patients who underwent antegrade endovascular aneurysm repair via the ascending aorta at our institution, 3 had an emergency intervention for rupture and 3 had an urgent intervention for impending rupture or complicated aortic dissection. The procedure was scheduled in 10 patients. The median patient age was 77 years. In 13 patients, one or more concomitant procedures were performed. In 6 patients, vascular access for endovascular aneurysm repair was obtained via a branch of the replacement graft. In 10 patients, direct cannulation of the ascending aorta was carried out using 2 pursestring sutures. The initial success rate was 100%. Early mortality occurred in 2 (12.5%) patients because of multiple organ failure in one and heart failure in the other. No patient required a second intervention during follow-up. The mean duration of follow-up was 19 months. The antegrade approach is a useful alternative in patients with no access suitable for endovascular aneurysm repair and who are not appropriate candidates for open conventional thoracic aortic surgery. This approach is applicable to selected patients."

From January 2015 to December 2016, 172 patients with acute type A aortic dissection underwent emergency surgical repair in our center. Among them, 76 were treated with the modified Cabrol fistula technique (fistula group), and the others did not receive this modified technique (nonfistula group). The clinical data of all patients were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. The preoperative data, cardiopulmonary bypass time, aortic crossclamp time, selective cerebral perfusion, and lower body arrest time of the 2 groups were similar. The chest closure time was shorter in the fistula group. The postoperative drainage, amount of red blood cell transfusion, incidence of reopening for hemostasis, mechanical ventilation support time, duration of intensive care unit stay, incidence of postoperative dialysis, and 30-day mortality were significantly lower in the fistula group than in the nonfistula group.

    "abstract": "Although outcomes of acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) have improved, malperfusion remains associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, and its optimal therapeutic treatment is unknown. Emergency central repair has been performed as our first-line approach for malperfusion. Here, we analyzed outcomes of ATAAD with malperfusion and reassessed emergency central repair. In total, 1026 ATAAD patients underwent emergency surgery within 48 h of symptom onset, of whom 318 (30.9%) patients complicated with any preoperative malperfusion were included. Pathophysiology of malperfusion and surgical outcomes were analyzed. The in-hospital mortality rate was 12.9% for patients with malperfusion and 4.8% for patients without malperfusion (p < 0.0001). Coronary malperfusion was complicated in 7.5% of patients (% dead per group, 19.5%), mesenteric malperfusion in 3.6% (24.3%), renal malperfusion in 8.8% (14.4%), lower leg malperfusion in 12.6% (13.7%), brain malperfusion in 9.7% (12.0%), and spinal malperfusion in 1.1% (18.2%). Mortality rates varied substantially according to the number of affected organ systems (none, 4.8%; one system, 10.4%; two systems, 14.5%; three systems, 30.0%, and four systems; 30.3%; p < 0.0001). In malperfused patients, logistic regression analysis revealed that obesity (body mass index > 30 kg/m2), preoperative shock (systolic blood pressure < 80 mmHg), and visceral ischemia were independent predictors for hospital death. Malperfusion of more organ systems and mesenteric malperfusion resulted in unfavorable prognosis, and effects of central repair were limited in such severe/complex malperfusion. To further improve outcomes of ATAAD with malperfusion, emergency reperfusion of affected organs followed by central repair might be considered."

    "abstract": "Repair of acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a complex and emergent cardiovascular surgery that is associated with high perioperative morbidity and mortality. Each cannulation strategy has different benefits and drawbacks during cardiopulmonary bypass. Using a retrospective study design, we aimed to clarify the safety and efficacy of right axillary artery cannulation in combination with femoral artery cannulation compared to single arterial cannulation for ATAAD repair. From January 2007 to July 2017, 476 adult patients underwent ATAAD repair at a single institution. Patients were classified into groups according to their cannulation strategy: the double arterial cannulation (DAC) group (n = 377; 79.2%) or single arterial cannulation (SAC) group (n = 99; 20.8%). Preoperative demographics, surgical information, and postoperative recovery were compared between both groups. Survival and freedom from reoperation rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier actuarial method. Demographics, comorbidities, and surgical procedures were generally homogenous between the two groups, except for sex, age, and rate of extensive aortic repair. Patients who underwent DAC had lower in-hospital mortality (13.5% vs. 25.3%; P = 0.005) and lower incidence of malperfusion-related complications (18.8% vs. 30.3%; P = 0.011) than those who underwent SAC. During multivariate analysis, SAC was identified as an in-hospital mortality predictor (odds ratio, 2.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.52-5.17; P = 0.001), as were preoperative ventilator support, intraoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation installation, and postoperative malperfusion-related complications. Three-year cumulative survival and freedom from reoperation rates were 74.8% and 85.3% for the DAC group and 62.6% and 81.1% for the SAC group, respectively (P = 0.010 and 0.430, respectively). With acceptable short- and mid-term outcomes, DAC is effective and safe for establishing cardiopulmonary bypass during ATAAD repair."

The secondary outcome was the percentage of records with adequate documentation of EMTALA compliance (ADoEMTALA). There were 563 electronically identified patients with 287 included in the final analysis. One hundred and five (36.6%) patients had ADoCC while 166 (57.8%) patients had ADoEMTALA. Patients with inadequate documentation of EMTALA (IDoEMTALA) were associated with a higher likelihood of not meeting the American Heart Association (AHA) ED Departure SBP guideline (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.03-3.2, P=0.04). Male gender, handwritten type of documentation, and transport by air were associated with an increased risk of inadequate documentation of clinical care (IDoCC), while receiving continuous infusion was associated with higher risk of IDoEMTALA. Documentation of clinical care and EMTALA compliance by Emergency Providers is poor. Inadequate EMTALA documentation was associated with a higher likelihood of patients not meeting the AHA ED Departure SBP guideline. Therefore, Emergency Providers should thoroughly document clinical care and EMTALA compliance among this critically ill group before transfer."

    "abstract": "This study retrospectively assessed in-hospital mortality and long-term results of emergency thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for patients with life-threatening acute complicated type B aortic dissection (acTBD). Between March 2001 and December 2016, there were 55 patients (40 male; median age, 52 ± 13 years) with an acTBD who were treated with TEVAR for malperfusion (58%), aortic rupture (18%), or persistent untreatable pain with true lumen reduction or rapid aortic diameter enlargement (24%) as a sign of disease progression. The patients were categorized according to clinical appearance into two groups: group A, malperfusion, pending rupture, or rupture; and group B, persistent ongoing pain, rapid enlargement of aortic diameter, or significant changes in the true to false lumen ratio. Four patients (7%) had undergone previous aortic surgery. Technical success (coverage of the primary intimal tear) was achieved in 50 patients (91%). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 9% (n = 5), and there was a statistically significant difference in early mortality between group A and group B (7% vs 2%; P < .02). Causes of in-hospital death were all aorta related, including a rupture during the procedure and on the first postinterventional day in two patients and redissection (ascending aorta, n = 2; descending aorta, n = 1) with a consequent aortic rupture after TEVAR in the remaining three. Permanent neurologic dysfunction occurred in five patients (stroke, n = 2; paraplegia, n = 3). Overall, 19 patients (34%) developed early endoleaks (type IA, n = 5; type IB, n = 11; type II, n = 2; type IB plus type II, n = 1). Therefore, 5 patients needed early (within 30 days) endovascular intervention because of a type IA (n = 2), type IB (n = 3), or type II endoleak (n = 1) and the rapid progression of aortic diameter, persistent signs of ischemia (n = 2), or rupture (n = 1), whereas the remaining 14 patients were treated conservatively and followed up by computed tomography angiography. Seven patients with early endoleaks needed an endovascular intervention (n = 3) or conventional surgery (n = 4) because of aortic progression in the follow-up period (mean interval after procedure, 92 ± 56 months). The actual survival rates were 87%, 85%, and 75% at 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years, respectively, and freedom from aorta-related death was 87%, 87%, and 77% at 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years, respectively. Freedom from reintervention for any cause using a Kaplan-Meier analysis was 70%, 68%, 68%, and 63% at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years, respectively. TEVAR of acTBD has been proven to be an excellent treatment modality in this cohort of high-risk patients, with promising midterm and long-term results."

We report our experience with LDS to better understand its natural history and treatment outcomes and help establish treatment guidelines. We retrospectively reviewed all patients with LDS who underwent medical or surgical treatment at Cleveland Clinic before April 27, 2017. Primary endpoints were postoperative in-hospital morbidity and mortality. Secondary endpoints were aorta-related reoperations and short- and long-term mortality. We identified 53 patients with LDS. Of these, 33 (62%) underwent aortic surgery. Mean age was 39 ± 14 years, and mean maximum aortic diameter was 4.3 cm. There were 2 (6%) deaths after urgent or emergency surgery. Twenty-two patients (67%) required no aortic reoperation; 20 of these had prophylactic surgery. Multiple aortic operations were performed on 11 (33%) patients, 9 of whom experienced aortic dissections. Six patients (18%) required total aortic replacement. Among 19 patients with modified root reimplantation, no aorta- or valve-related complications occurred. Overall, 33 patients underwent 58 aortic and 81 cardiovascular operations, with 1 late death. Kaplan-Meier survival of the aortic-surgery cohort was 89% at 10 years (median follow-up 5.2 years). There were no late deaths in the non-aortic surgery group (20/53; 38%). Prophylactic aortic surgical outcomes in LDS are excellent. Surgical reintervention remains high, particularly after aortic dissections. Close surveillance of medically managed and postoperative patients and early prophylactic surgery are crucial to avoid aortic catastrophe and achieve a good long-term prognosis."

    "abstract": "Acute Type A aortic dissection exhibits poor in-hospital outcomes after emergency surgery. Evaluation of risk predictors for in-hospital major adverse outcomes (MAO) is key to reducing the mortality rate and improving the quality of care. We enrolled 70 patients who presented with postoperative MAO and 195 patients who recovered well. Through univariate and multivariate analyses, clinical characteristics were compared between the patients in the 2 groups. In-hospital mortality was 6.4% in this series. The patients in the MAO group were older and had a higher frequency of coronary artery involvement by dissection (60.0% vs 21.0%) (P < 0.05). Preoperatively, when compared to the group of patients without MAO, the patients in the MAO group were more likely to have a neurological deficit (18.6% vs 9.7%) and, to a certain extent, lower limb symptoms encompassing visceral and renal malperfusion (20.0% vs 8.2%) (P < 0.05). Compared to patients with MAO, patients without MAO experienced longer duration from initial onset of symptoms to surgery and had an ascending aorta with a larger diameter. In patients with MAO, the average durations of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), cardiac arrest and hypothermic circulatory arrest were much longer than those in patients with no MAO (all P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that in-hospital adverse outcomes were associated with older age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.047 (1.008-1.087), P < 0.05], presentation of lower limb symptoms prior to surgery [OR = 2.905 (1.109-7.608), P < 0.05] and long CPB duration [OR = 1.011 (1.005-1.018), P < 0.01]. When patients with acute Type A aortic dissection experienced a duration from symptom onset to surgery [OR = 0.993 (0.987-0.999), P < 0.05] or had an ascending aorta with a large diameter [OR = 0.942 (0.892-0.995), P < 0.05], the number of postoperative adverse events decreased significantly. At a centre that has a large caseload, where practitioners can become proficient through experience as well as training, good outcomes can be dependably produced in patients with acute Type A aortic dissection and without malperfusion syndromes. For patients presenting with these risk features, MAO need to be anticipated, and the incidence of a composite end point of major adverse events remains unsatisfactory."

An electrocardiogram-gated CT aortogram excluded the emergency department's primary consideration of aortic dissection, but incidentally revealed a myocardial perfusion defect and corresponding coronary artery stenosis. Cardiac catheterization performed the following day confirmed the CT findings and the patient underwent angioplasty and stent placement.

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection is a deadly disease that should be recognized promptly. We report an exceptional case of a 44-year-old African American female who presented with a rapidly progressing severe frontal headache. Initial computed tomography of the brain was negative. The following day, she developed uncontrolled hypertension and worsening headache. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was therefore done and showed evidence of acute/subacute ischemic infarcts. The patient was managed as having an ischemic stroke. For that reason, an echocardiogram was done the next day that showed a dilated aortic root and moderate-to-severe aortic regurgitation. This was followed by a computed tomography angiography which showed ascending aortic dissection involving bilateral common carotid arteries. After an urgent surgical intervention, the patient recovered without any sequelae. Patients with an acute dissection can present with atypical clinical features, such as an isolated rapidly progressive headache, which might delay the diagnosis and jeopardize their lives. Hence, high-risk patients with rapidly progressive unexplained severe headaches should be considered for imaging of the aorta."

    "abstract": "The majority of aortic aneurysms comorbid with atherosclerosis can be asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally on routine physical examination or on imaging studies for other indications. Transthoracic echocardiography is a basic modality to assess patients with coronary artery disease and can be used for the screening of aortic aneurysm. Acute aortic dissection is a highly lethal cardiovascular emergency and requires prompt recognition. Although cardiovascular echo has a suboptimal accuracy rate for detecting aortic dissection, it is noninvasive, readily available, and easy to use. Recently, the concept of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) refers to the use of portable ultrasound at the patient's bedside for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. POCUS could become an important tool in the screening and primary diagnosis for acute aortic dissection. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was established to detect aortic dissection and determine the therapy. However, the use of TEE has decreased with the progress of contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Currently, attention is paid to TEE in the monitoring for the operation of aortic dissection, the use on bedside, and in emergency room, and the precise evaluation of aortic dissection for the patient with a history of allergy of contrast media and/or renal disturbance."

PubMed and MEDLINE electronic databases were searched in order to identify studies with emergency or prophylactic V-A ECMO application in association with TAVI procedures. From November 2012 to November 2017, 14 relevant studies were identified that included 5,115 TAVI patients of whom 102 (2%) required V-A ECMO (22 prophylactically, 66 as an emergency and 14 without a reported indication). The reason for emergency V-A ECMO institution was detailed in 64 patients: left ventricle free wall rupture (n = 14), haemodynamic instability (n = 12), ventricular arrhythmias (n = 7), aortic annulus rupture (n = 6), coronary obstruction (n = 6), low left ventricular output (ejection fraction <35%) (n = 5), uncontrollable bleeding (n = 5), severe aortic regurgitation (n = 4), prosthesis embolisation (n = 3), aortic dissection (n = 1) and respiratory failure (n = 1). Femoral arterial and vein cannulation was the most common access technique for V-A ECMO institution. Major bleeding (n = 7) and vascular access complications (n = 7) were reported after ECMO institution. The overall in-hospital survival was 73% (61% in the emergency vs. 100% in the prophylactic group). V-A ECMO support should be available at any centre performing TAVI and provides effective mechanical circulatory support in an emergency setting. We present an algorithm to aid decisions about prophylactic circulatory assistance with V-A ECMO and it should form part of the heart team discussion before a TAVI procedure is undertaken."

    "abstract": "Background Iatrogenic coronary artery injuries during percutaneous coronary interventions ( PCI ) often require emergent surgical management. Our study evaluated the early and long-term outcomes in patients undergoing surgical treatment of iatrogenic PCI complications and identified the predictors of operative and long-term mortality. Methods and Results Pre-, intra- and post-operative data and hospital outcomes of 168 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgical procedures for iatrogenic complications following PCI between December 1999 and July 2015, were prospectively collected in our computerized database. Logistic and Cox regression analyses were used to identify the independent predictors of operative and long-term mortality. The mean age was 68.5±10.2 years and 35.7% were females. PCI complications included left anterior descending (38.7%), right coronary (29.2%), circumflex (13.1%), left main coronary artery injuries (19.0%), and acute myocardial infarction (66.7%), Type A aortic dissection (7.7%), cardiac tamponade (17.9%), and cardiogenic shock ( CS ) (46.4%). Operative mortality for corrective surgery was 20.8% and was independently predicted by critical preoperative state (odds ratio: 3.5; P=0.01). The 5- and 10-year survival for all patients was 63.9±4.0% and 49.6±5.0%, which improved remarkably in hospital survivors (79.0±4.0% and 64.0±6.0%). Risk factors for long-term mortality were critical preoperative state (hazard ratio: 3.5; P<0.0001) and coronary artery occlusion during PCI (hazard ratio: 2.6; P=0.002). The 5- and 10-year freedom from major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events was 59.7±4.0% and 41.9±5.0%. Conclusions Iatrogenic injuries after PCI or coronary angiography requiring surgical correction are associated with a high operative and long-term mortality. Patients developing acute coronary artery occlusion have a more guarded long-term prognosis. Hospital survivors, however, have a superior long-term survival."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Patients undergoing cardiac surgery are at risk of adverse perioperative neurological complications. Cerebral oximetry monitoring is increasingly used in these patients to detect intraoperative cerebral hypoxia or ischemic events. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) uses the near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum for oximetry imaging. A case is reported of the persistence of normal tissue oxygenation monitored by NIRS values despite a prolonged perioperative cardiac arrest. CASE REPORT A 65-year-old man was admitted to the Emergency Department with dysarthria, left facial ptosis, left hemiplegia, and arterial hypotension of 75/50 mmHg. Computed tomography (CT) angiography showed a Stanford type A aortic dissection extending to the right common carotid artery. Shortly after arrival in the operating room, his hemodynamic condition rapidly deteriorated resulting in cardiac arrest. Despite the rapid onset of extracorporeal circulation, adequate systemic blood flow could not be restored. Cerebral NIRS values remained within the normal range (70-80%) from the start of emergency resuscitation, during a prolonged period of extremely low global blood perfusion values, and until all resuscitation ceased. CONCLUSIONS Cerebral oximetry values reflect a balance between cerebral oxygen delivery and consumption. This case demonstrated the persistence of normal tissue oxygenation monitored by NIRS values despite a prolonged perioperative cardiac arrest."

TAVI is also recommended for structural valve degeneration of a biological valve prosthesis. TAVI-specific complications, such as prosthesis embolization and aortic dissection, are uncommon but potential concerns. A 73-year-old woman presented with structural valve degeneration 14 years after aortic root replacement with a bioprosthetic valved conduit. The patient underwent TAVI valve-in-valve under monitored anaesthesia care. Intraoperatively, the self-expandable prosthesis was difficult to deploy within the valved conduit and ultimately migrated distally. During the technically difficult passage of the prosthesis delivery system through the tortuous aorta, the patient started reporting symptoms suggestive of aortic dissection. An emergency computed tomography scan confirmed type B dissection. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair followed by deployment of a balloon-expandable prosthesis below the self-expandable implant was performed. Careful prosthesis selection in valve-in-valve patients after aortic root replacement is crucial for procedural success."

We previously reported a case with ultrasound findings of a homogeneous hemopericardium and evidence highly indicative of hemorrhagic cardiac tamponade complicated by AAAD. Here, we report a similar case who presented with a more serious situation and for whom critical care ultrasound revealed fast blood clot formation within the hemopericardium. A 63-year-old man was admitted to our emergency department with a complaint of a tearing chest pain for 10 minutes. Asymmetric blood pressure was detected in the upper limbs and AAAD was highly suspected. An electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor was placed in a timely manner. However, during this procedure, he went into cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated. Critical care ultrasound revealed hemorrhagic cardiac tamponade with blood clot formation surrounding the epicardium, strongly indicating the rupture of an ascending aortic root dissection. Standard CPR continued for 30 minutes. Spontaneous cardiac rhythm was not restored and the patient died. Critical care ultrasound is a useful tool for assessing emergency cardiac arrest. Ultrasound findings of fast clot formation within the hemopericardium may indicate faster bleeding due to the rupture of an AAAD and may predict poor clinical outcomes."

We examine the long-term safety and durability of the David V VSRR compared with ROOT in TAAD repair. From March 2004 to April 2017, 136 patients underwent repair of acute TAAD using either ROOT (n = 77; 56.6%) or VSRR (n = 59; 43.4%). Annual echocardiograms were performed for follow-up in VSRR patients. Univariable regression, Kaplan-Meier, and competing risk analyses were performed. Preoperative characteristics were similar between groups, except that VSRR patients were younger (mean age 43.5 ± 11.4 years VSRR vs 50.4 ± 3.0 years ROOT; P = .001). Both groups had similar rates of preoperative malperfusion or shock (29.3% VSRR vs 37.0% ROOT; P = .35) and ≥3+ aortic insufficiency (63% VSRR vs 76.8% ROOT). Thirty-day mortality in the VSRR group was 2/59 (3.4%) and 11/77 in the ROOT group (14.3%; P < .001). All-cause survival at 9 years was 92% (VSRR) and 59% (ROOT; P = .002). The incidence of aortic reintervention was similar between groups (20%-23% at 5 years; P = .81). At 9 years of follow-up, 5/52 (9.6%) VSRR patients had ≥2+ aortic insufficiency, and 1 patient required valve reintervention. In highly-selected patients, the David V VSRR provides a safe repair of acute TAAD with concomitant root pathology and valve insufficiency. In our center, the incidence of valve-related reintervention at long-term follow-up is low after emergent repair."

A 54-year-old man presented with chronic mesenteric ischemia and a previous TEVAR for MCAD complicated by superior mesenteric artery (SMA) malperfusion. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) demonstrated a 3-channel aortic dissection with a \"false-true-false\" configuration. The SMA was malperfused through the collapsed TL. CTA also showed a secondary entry tear, measuring 18 mm in diameter, at the end of the previous endograft. Direct open surgery or endovascular revascularization of the SMA was not feasible. A plan was devised to improve SMA perfusion by increasing the TL inflow. With the assistance of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), an endograft was placed through one false lumen in the abdominal aorta and through the TL in the descending thoracic aorta to seal the secondary entry tear. Symptoms of mesenteric ischemia resolved 2 days after the procedure. At 1 year, he is asymptomatic, has gained weight, and has improved SMA perfusion and remodeling of the 3-channel dissection on CTA. IVUS imaging can help evaluate the complex hemodynamics of MCAD. Patient-specific endovascular treatment of MCAD with mesenteric malperfusion seems to be a feasible bailout alternative treatment for urgent, complex cases without reconstruction options."

It is rare but often results in a devastating event for both the pregnant patient and the foetus. Two cases of acute AD (Stanford type A) in pregnant females are presented in the present study. The patients were diagnosed via echocardiography, and the diagnosis was confirmed with computed tomography angiography prior to aortic surgery. Up to 50% of ADs in pregnancy occur in patients with fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene mutations. The FBN1 gene was sequenced in both patients, and notable, novel pathogenic mutations of FBN1 were identified in both patients. A literature review was also performed on available diagnostic imaging and other measurements regarding AD during pregnancy. The authors suggest that the relevant content may have important clinical implications in raising disease awareness, arranging test rationally and choosing an intervention method."

The presence or absence of these variants in the index patient and other family members was verified by Sanger sequencing. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a Cypriot family case diagnosed with TAA presented by two novel variants one in the ACTA2 and the other in the MYH11 genes. We describe two novel variants in a Cypriot family with TAA that are potentially pathogenic, highlighting the importance of molecular genetic evaluation in families with TAA. These results may prove useful for screening purposes in Cypriot patients with non-syndromic familial TAA facilitating early identification of atrisk family members and direct intervention."

    "title": "Dissected Aorta Repair Through Stent Implantation trial: Canadian results.",
    "abstract": "We describe the Canadian results of the Ascyrus Medical Dissection Stent (AMDS), a novel partially uncovered aortic arch hybrid graft implanted antegrade during hypothermic circulatory arrest to promote true lumen expansion and enhance aortic remodeling. From March 2017 to February 2018, 16 consecutive patients (66 ± 12 years; 38% female) presented with acute type A aortic dissections and underwent emergent surgical aortic repair with AMDS implantation. All patients presented with DeBakey I aortic dissection, with evidence of malperfusion in 50% (n = 8) of patients. All cases were performed under hypothermic circulatory arrest with an additional average duration for AMDS implantation time of 2.1 minutes. All 16 device implantations were successful. Overall 30-day mortality was 6.3% (n = 1) and stroke occurred in 6.3% (n = 1) of cases. There was no incidence of device-related aortic injury or aortic arch branch vessel occlusion. During the follow-up period, 12 patients had completed at least 1 postoperative computed tomography scan. At initial follow-up computed tomography scan, complete or partial thrombosis, and remodeling of the aortic arch occurred in 91.7% of cases (n = 11/12) and in the proximal descending thoracic aorta, complete or partial thrombosis, and remodeling occurred in 91.7% (n = 11/12). Preliminary results suggest that the AMDS is a safe, feasible and reproducible adjunct to current surgical approaches for acute DeBakey I aortic dissection repair. Further, the AMDS manages malperfusion and promotes early positive remodeling in the aortic arch and distal dissected segments, with favorable FL closure rates at follow-up. Ongoing follow-up will provide additional insight into the long-term effects of the AMDS."

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in surgical techniques and endovascular devices, the management of ruptured type B aortic dissection remains challenging. Herein, we describe a patient with a history of chronic type B aortic dissection who presented to the emergency department with a massive left hemothorax and profound shock. Computed tomography demonstrated a thoracic dissecting aneurysm with false lumen rupture. He underwent emergent thoracic endovascular aortic repair and carotid-carotid crossover bypass in a hybrid operating room. Although the thoracic endovascular aortic repair resulted in suitable sealing over the primary entry tear, aortography revealed prominent retrograde flow through the distal re-entry tear into the false lumen. To depressurize the ruptured aortic segment fully, we implanted a modified candy-plug device in the false lumen and successfully occluded the retrograde flow. This case report illustrates the preliminary experience of using modified candy-plug device to rescue a critical patient with ruptured type B aortic dissection."

    "title": "Impact of a streamlined rotational system for the management of acute aortic syndrome: sharing is caring†.",
    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection is an emergency associated with up to 30% of hospital mortality. It has been established that outcomes are improved with specialist aortic team care in high-volume centres. Most centres are limited to a small number of aortic specialists, thus making it logistically impractical to have a dedicated 24/7 single-centre service. In 2011, a rotational 24/7 service between 3 centres covering a geographical location was introduced including 24/7 access to a dissection 'Hotline'. We analysed data since 2003 from a prospectively collected database. A total of 227 patients underwent surgery for acute aortic syndrome between 2003 and 2017. The results on outcomes were compared before and after the initiation of the dissection hotline and 24/7 dedicated service. We identified 128 patients from the pre-rotational group and 99 patients from the post-rotational group. Both groups were well matched in terms of demographics and comorbidities. In the post-rotational group, there was an increase in arch surgery (11.8% vs 20.2%, P: 0.07). The introduction of the rotational service reduced 30-day mortality (20% vs 8%, P: 0.010). The introduction of the service improved the overall long-term survival [P: 0.04, hazard ratio 1.86; confidence interval (1.03-3.38)] in the multivariable analysis. There was no difference between the groups in postoperative complications. There was an increase in the median length of hospital stay in the post-rotational group (13 days vs 20 days, P: 0.014). A streamlined aortic dissection service allows for centralized care. This provides the referring centres with 24/7 access to an experienced aortic team and may improve patient outcomes."

    "title": "Outcomes and emergency medical services resource utilization among patients with syncope arriving to the emergency department by ambulance.",
    "abstract": "Syncope accounts for 1% of emergency department (ED) visits, yet few experience a serious adverse event (SAE). Two-thirds of syncope patients are transported to the ED by ambulance, placing considerable burden on emergency medical services (EMS), and many of these transports may be unnecessary. We estimated the proportion of syncope patients who fell into a low-risk category based on an ED diagnosis of vasovagal syncope and the absence of EMS intervention, hospitalization, or SAE. We conducted a multicentre prospective cohort study enrolling adult syncope patients transported to the ED by ambulance over 13 months. We collected demographics and EMS interventions, and followed patients for 30 days to identify all SAE, including death, dysrhythmia, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, subarachnoid hemorrhage, significant hemorrhage, and related procedural interventions. Of 990 (67.2%) patients transported to the ED by ambulance, 121 had EMS interventions, 137 suffered 30-day SAE, 393 (39.7%; 95%CI 36.6, 42.8) were deemed low risk, 41 patients with vasovagal syncope were lost to follow-up, and 298 patients were diagnosed with non-vasovagal syncope. During transport, 121 (12.2%; 95%CI 10.2, 14.3) patients underwent some EMS intervention, and 137 (14.6%; 95%CI 12.4, 16.9) suffered SAEs within 30 days. About 40% of patients transported to the ED by ambulance are at low risk and may not benefit from paramedic care or transport to a hospital. A robust clinical decision tool would help identify patients safe for treat-and-release, diversion to alternative care, or rapid offload into low-acuity ED areas, potentially reducing EMS workload and cost. Les syncopes motivent 1 % des consultations au service des urgences (SU), mais le malaise entraîne peu d’événements indésirables graves (EIG). Ainsi, deux tiers des patients ayant subi une syncope sont transportés en ambulance au SU, ce qui impose un lourd fardeau sur les services médicaux d’urgence (SMU), et pourtant bon nombre de transports effectués seraient non nécessaires. Aussi l’étude visait-elle à estimer la proportion de patients ayant subi une syncope dont l’état serait jugé à faible risque d’après le diagnostic de syncope vasovagale posé au SU ainsi que d’après l’absence d’intervention faite par les SMU, d’hospitalisation ou d’EIG. Il s’agit d’une étude prospective de cohortes, multicentrique, menée chez des adultes qui ont subi une syncope et qui ont été transportés en ambulance au SU, sur une période de 13 mois. Ont été recueillies des données démographiques ainsi que les notes sur les interventions effectuées par les SMU; à cela s’ajoute un suivi de 30 jours aux fins de collecte de renseignements sur tout EIG : mort, arythmie, infarctus du myocarde, dissection de l’aorte, embolie pulmonaire, hémorragie sous-arachnoïdienne, hémorragie importante et gestes interventionnels liés aux troubles en question. Au total, 990 patients (67,2 %) ont été transportés en ambulance au SU; sur ce nombre, 121 ont subi des interventions pratiquées par les SMU; 137 ont connu un EIG au cours des 30 jours suivant le malaise; 393 (39,7 %; IC à 95 % : 36,6-42,8) ont été jugés à faible risque; 41 ayant fait une syncope vasovagale ont été perdus de vue durant le suivi; et 298, ont fait une syncope non vasovagale. Durant le transport, 121 patients (12,2 %; IC à 95 % : 10,2-14,3) ont subi une forme quelconque d’intervention par les SMU et, au cours des 30 jours de suivi, 137 (14,6 %; IC à 95 % : 12,4-16,9) ont connu un EIG. Environ 40 % des patients transportés en ambulance au SU connaissent un faible risque et, dans leur cas, la prestation de soins paramédicaux ou le transport à l’hôpital pourraient ne pas être nécessaires. Un outil d’aide à la décision clinique qui soit digne de confiance pourrait faciliter le repérage des patients dont l’état se prêterait au traitement suivi du congé, à une orientation vers d’autres types de soins ou à un passage rapide dans des zones de petites urgences, ce qui permettrait à la fois de réduire la charge de travail des SMU ainsi que les coûts."

    "title": "Identifying Myocardial Ischemia due to Coronary Microvascular Dysfunction in the Emergency Department: Introducing a New Paradigm in Acute Chest Pain Evaluation.",
    "abstract": "Chest pain stands as one of the most frequent patient presentations in the emergency department (ED). Despite established diagnostic algorithms for identifying several important causes of chest pain, such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI), aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism, guidance on managing patients with recurrent chest pain, one of the top 3 reasons for repeated hospitalization in the United States, is less defined. The assessment of symptoms, serial ECG, and necrosis biomarkers plays a major role in patient management. Notably, the recently introduced high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) assay is helping to identify ischemia in patients previously undiagnosed by conventional testing. In Europe, with the use of this assay for over a decade, the identification of patients with AMI has substantially increased, particularly of patients with type 2 AMI, which is seen in the absence of atherosclerotic obstruction of the epicardial coronaries on angiography. Use of hs-TnT is in particular relevant in women, in whom the use of a sex-specific threshold for elevated hs-TnT has almost doubled the diagnosis of AMI. With the advent of the hs-TnT assay in the United States in 2017, a similar phenomenon is expected. Thus, it is important to learn from the European experience and to develop sex-specific nuanced algorithms for the evaluation of additional causes of myocardial ischemia/necrosis, such as coronary artery vasomotor disorders and coronary microvascular dysfunction. The latter has a high prevalence among symptomatic women presenting to the ED, a group in whom recurrent chest pain is common. This commentary describes the tools available for diagnosing epicardial- and non-epicardial-related myocardial ischemia in patients with recurrent chest pain in the ED setting. A sex-specific, nuanced approach applied to select groups of patients being observed in the ED has the potential to reduce admissions and to allow for the initiation of timely, appropriate medical treatment and outpatient follow-up in an at-risk population. The costs and availability of advanced diagnostics may pose some limitation to the widespread adoption of such protocols."

    "title": "Acute medical management of aortic dissection.",
    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection is a life-threatening disease. Current therapeutic guidelines recommend medical therapy with aggressive blood pressure lowering for patients with acute aortic dissection, when they are not indicated for emergency surgery. In particular, patients with aortic dissection without ascending aorta involvement (Stanford type B) are treated medically, unless they have fatal complications. Patients with type B aortic dissection who have critical complications have higher early mortality than that in patients without complications. However, recent advances in thoracic endovascular aortic repair can improve the clinical outcomes in such patients. Accordingly, current guidelines recommend thoracic endovascular aortic repair for patients with complicated type B aortic dissection. However, patients with visceral ischemia still have a poor prognosis, even when they are treated with thoracic endovascular aortic repair; an early diagnosis and intervention is crucial to prevent mortality. Understanding the pathophysiological anatomy that can induce organ malperfusion might be important for an early diagnosis and intervention. This review summarizes the current state of acute medical management in patients with acute aortic dissection, based on current evidence and expert consensus, focusing on patients with type B aortic dissection."

    "abstract": "Octogenarians are often declined an emergency operation for acute type A aortic dissection on grounds of high mortality rate and short life expectancy. Our policy is to accept all patients at any time and never to refuse an emergency operation, even for octogenarians. From April 2004 to September 2017, 319 patients underwent surgical repair for acute type A aortic dissection at our institution. We compared the clinical results between the 55 elderly patients (≥80 years old; older group) and the 264 nonelderly patients (≤79 years old; younger group). The primary end point was early mortality, and the secondary end point was long-term mortality. The older group had a higher proportion of women (74.5% vs 46.6%), a lower body mass index (21.4 vs 23.8 kg/m2), and a lower proportion of smokers (20.0% vs 46.2%). In the two groups (older vs younger), postoperative stroke occurred in 12.7% versus 11.4% and hospital mortality in 10.2% versus 10.9%, with no significant statistical difference. In multivariate analysis, older age of 80 years or older was not a significant risk factor for hospital mortality. Among the hospital survivors, the actuarial survival rate at 8 years was 52.5% in the older group and 85.0% in the younger group (p = 0.005). Emergency surgical repair for type A aortic dissection in octogenarians without patient selection resulted in similar rates of mortality and morbidity as younger patients. Octogenarians should not be refused this life-saving emergency operation."

    "abstract": "False-positive diagnosis of acute Stanford type A aortic dissection (AAD) on computed tomography angiography (CTA) is still an issue and may lead to substantial consequences. Given that electrocardiography (ECG)-gated CTA provides greater diagnostic safety, it may be assumed that interhospital referrals with a diagnosis of AAD based on non-ECG-gated pre-referral CTA carry an elevated risk of false-positive diagnosis. We reviewed a series of patients in whom a diagnosis of AAD based on non-ECG-gated pre-referral CTA was subsequently proven false by ECG-gated CTA. The artifacts that gave rise to the misdiagnosis, as well as the diagnostic pathways followed and the consequences of false-positive diagnosis were investigated. In 5 patients, ECG-gated repeat CTA revealed artifacts in the pre-referral scans that had led to false-positive diagnosis and referral for emergent surgery. In the first case, the patient proceeded to surgery. In 4 subsequent cases, ECG-gated CTA was ordered because a false-positive diagnosis was suspected. We found that ECG-gated CTA rather than echocardiography provided sufficient information to rule out AAD in each of these cases. Comparison between pre-referral non-ECG-gated scans and ECG-gated repeat CTA demonstrated the wide range of artifacts that may give rise to a diagnosis of AAD. Patient condition permitting, the threshold to ECG-gated repeat CTA should be low when doubt arises with regard to a diagnosis of AAD based on non-ECG-gated CTA in interhospital referrals."

A 67-year-old male presented to the emergency department with left-sided hemiplegia shortly after receiving a Heimlich maneuver. Acute ischemic stroke was suspected, and the thrombolytic protocol was initiated. Fortunately, Stanford type A aortic dissection was diagnosed before the thrombolytic therapy was initiated. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Aortic dissection can develop after the Heimlich maneuver. For patients who develop a neurologic deficit after the Heimlich maneuver, vascular dissection should be considered as a possible cause."

    "abstract": "Lithium has been used to treat bipolar disorder. Lithium has a narrow therapeutic index, with a therapeutic level between 0.6 and 1.5 mEq/L. The possible complications of lithium overdose include altered mental status, hand tremor, muscle weakness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, seizure, syncope, and arrhythmia. Lithium intoxication can be fatal and is difficult to diagnose in patients without a history of lithium intake. The occurrence of serious cardiac arrhythmias is rare in lithium intoxication. An 81-year-old man was brought to the emergency department because of consciousness disturbance for 2 days. According to his daughter, he had a history of hypertension and diabetes. Recently, his family also observed slurring of speech and easy choking. The physical examination findings were unremarkable. Blood examination only revealed impaired renal function. Twelve-lead electrocardiography revealed sinus rhythm with first-degree atrioventricular block. Chest radiography revealed mediastinal widening. The blood pressures obtained from the 4 limbs showed no significant differences. Subsequently, brain computed tomography revealed no obvious intracranial lesion. A neurologist was consulted, and a recent ischemic stroke could not be ruled out. While in the observation area, his systolic blood pressure decreased to <90 mm Hg and he showed bradycardia, and 12-lead electrocardiography revealed an AV block and long pulse. Contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography revealed no evidence of aortic dissection. Another family member reported a history of lithium intake for bipolar disorder for >30 years. Blood examination revealed a lithium concentration of 2.65 mEq/L. A nephrologist was consulted, and emergency hemodialysis was indicated. Dopamine was administered for his shock status via a right neck central venous catheter. His lithium level gradually declined after the hemodialysis, and blood pressure and consciousness level improved subsequently. The patient was discharged 9 days later in a stable condition. If an emergency physician encounters a patient with altered consciousness and arrhythmia with cardiogenic shock, the patient's drug intake history should be carefully reviewed to rule out cardiovascular problems on the basis of the patient's clinical condition."

Progression of aortic dissections may be missed on CECT chest, which would be done in the initial hours after injury. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is equally efficient for the diagnosis of aortic dissection. It may also provide additional information that can be very useful for the management.

    "abstract": "Acute aortic syndrome (AAS) is a time-sensitive and difficult-to-diagnose aortic emergency. The American Heart Association (AHA) proposed the acute aortic dissection detection risk score (ADD-RS) as a means to reduce miss rate and improve time to diagnosis. Previous validation studies were performed in a high prevalence population of patients. We do not know how the rule will perform in a lower-prevalence population. This is important because application of a rule with low specificity would increase imaging rates and complications. Our goal was to assess if the diagnostic accuracy of the score would be maintained in a low-prevalence population that we are attempting to risk stratify in the emergency department (ED). Retrospective cohort of patients age 18 years old and older who presented to two tertiary care EDs from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2015, and underwent a computed tomographic angiography to rule out AAS. Two trained reviewers extracted data using a standardized data collection form. AAS was defined according to accepted radiologic standards. The components of the AHA risk score were defined a priori. Agreement was measured using kappa statistic. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Analysis was performed using SAS 9.4 University Edition. A total 370 patients underwent computed tomography for suspected AAS. Chief presenting symptoms were chest pain (207, 58%), back pain (26, 7%), abdominal pain (32, 8.6%), syncope (7, 2.6%), and symptoms of stroke (6, 1.6%). AAS was finally diagnosed in 12 (3.2%) patients: five (1.4%) type A aortic dissection, four (1%) type B aortic dissection, two (0.5%) an aortic intramural hematoma, no penetrating aortic ulcer, and one a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. The presence of one or more ADD risk markers (ADD-RS ≥ 1) was associated with a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI = 73.5%-100%) and a specificity of 12.3% (95% CI = 9.1%-16.2%) for the diagnosis of AAS. The negative likelihood ratio was 0 and the positive likelihood ratio was 1.14 (95% CI = 1.1-1.2). Our study confirms that in North America the prevalence of AAS in those undergoing advanced imaging is low. The ADD-RS in this population has a low specificity. A lack of defined inclusion criteria and a low specificity limits the application of this rule in practice."

The aim of this study was to compare outcomes of three different surgical approaches in patients with Stanford A AAD. From January 2006 to March 2015 a total of 240 consecutive patients with diagnosed Stanford A AAD underwent elective, isolated surgical aortic repair in our centre. Patients were divided into three groups according to the extent of surgical repair: isolated replacement of the ascending aorta, hemiarch replacement and total arch replacement. Patients were followed up for up to 9 years. After univariate analysis multinomial logistic regression was performed for subgroup analysis. Baseline characteristics and endpoints as well as long-term survival were analysed. There were no statistically significant differences among the three groups in terms of demographics and preoperative baseline and clinical characteristics. Incidence of in-hospital stroke ( p = 0.034), need for reopening due to bleeding ( p = 0.031) and in-hospital mortality ( p = 0.017) increased significantly with the extent of the surgical approach. There was no statistical difference in terms of long-term survival ( p = 0.166) among the three groups. Applying multinomial logistic regression for subgroup analysis significantly higher odds for stroke ( p = 0.023), reopening for bleeding ( p = 0.010) and in-hospital mortality ( p = 0.009) for the arch surgery group in comparison to the ascending aorta surgery group as well as significantly higher odds for stroke ( p = 0.029) for the total arch surgery group in comparison to the hemiarch surgery group were identified. With Stanford A AAD the incidence of perioperative complications increased significantly with the extent of the surgical approach. Subgroup analysis and long-term follow up in patients undergoing isolated ascending or hemiarch surgery showed a lower incidence of cerebrovascular events compared with surgery for total arch replacement."

Our hospital database contained records for 156 consecutive patients who underwent AAD repair between March 2000 and February 2013. They were assigned to the in-hospital mortality or the survival group. All data were collected retrospectively. The 30-day mortality, including intraoperative deaths, was 14.1% (22/156). Total in-hospital mortality was 19.2% (30/156). Patients who required preoperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (16.7 vs 3.2%; P = 0.012), or who presented with preoperative cardiac tamponade (46.7 vs 19.0%; P = 0.002), shock/hypotension (56.7 vs 21.4%; P < 0.001), or coma (20.0 vs 6.3%; P = 0.019) had a higher in-hospital mortality rate. There was no difference in in-hospital mortality rate between patients with preoperative AKI or not. Mortality and major complications were significantly correlated with the severity of AKI. Multivariate analysis confirmed that preoperative shock or hypotension (odds ratio = 5.2; 95% CI = 2.2-12.3), and preoperative AKI stage 3 (odds ratio = 4.9; 95% CI = 1.3-19.3) were independent preoperative prognostic factors of in-hospital mortality. On the basis of our results, preoperative stage 3 AKI is a crucial prognostic risk factor for patients with AAD repair, Cardiac surgeons should be aware of this condition when dealing with AAD patients."

The distal end of the FL formed a pouch-like blind alley above the suture line of the bifurcated abdominal graft. The true lumen (TL) was compressed and caused severe limb ischemia. The right renal artery (rRA) originated from the FL. The patient had initially undergone emergent axillofemoral bypass for limb malperfusion. Three weeks later, restenosis of the TL caused visceral malperfusion, and a huge thrombus formed in the FL pouch. TEVAR expanded the TL and restored visceral vascularization. However, the expanded TL compressed the thrombus in the blind alley to the rRA orifice and caused right renal malperfusion. The history of abdominal graft replacement may have increased the risk of a thrombotic event after TEVAR. Primary TEVAR may have helped prevent thrombus formation in the FL pouch. <Learning objective: This case report describes visceral arterial embolism induced by endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for type B aortic dissection in a patient with prior abdominal aortic grafting. A huge thrombus formed in the blind pouch of the false lumen (FL) above the graft suture line. TEVAR expanded the true lumen and the FL thrombus occluded a visceral artery with FL origin. Post-graft replacement has a risk of thrombus formation in the FL pouch and thrombus compression in visceral arteries.>."

    "abstract": "Enlargement due to residual dissection after surgical ascending aortic replacement is technically challenging to treat. Endovascular entry closure using an Amplatzer vascular plug 2 (AVP2) in the sub-acute phase has not been reported. A 75-year-old female underwent emergent ascending aorta replacement for Stanford type A aortic dissection. Postoperative computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed a distal aortic arch diameter of 41 mm and a patent false lumen. CTA one month after the operation revealed distal aortic arch enlargement to 52 mm, which is considered high-risk for rupture. Repeat open surgery was considered but carried a high risk of perioperative complications. Therefore, we performed endovascular closure for the entry at the proximal descending aorta using an AVP2 and stent graft coverage and coil embolization for the re-entries at the bilateral iliac arteries. CTA one month after the procedure revealed that the false lumen of the aortic arch was thrombosed and that the distal aortic arch had shrunk to 38 mm, indicating the efficacy of endovascular entry closure with the AVP2 after aortic dissection. <Learning objective: Endovascular entry closure for residual dissection more than 2 years after ascending aorta replacement has already been reported. We conducted this procedure in the sub-acute phase and induced favorable aortic remodeling. The endovascular entry closure was successfully conducted for a patient presenting residual tears after emergent ascending aorta replacement, considering a treatment option with high risk for repeat open surgery.>."

Here, we report a case of conservatively treated coronary malperfusion associated with acute type A dissection before aortic root replacement. An 81-year-old woman was rushed to our hospital in a state of circulatory shock after developing chest pain. She was severely hypotensive on admission, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed anterior and lateral ST elevation. However, the initial fluid resuscitation increased her blood pressure to a normal level, and the ischemic ECG changes disappeared in about 20 min. ECG-gated cardiac multidetector computed tomography showed a type A aortic dissection complicated with left main trunk dissection. A primary entry tear was located 5 mm below the left coronary ostium. The patient successfully underwent composite graft replacement of the aortic root in a stable hemodynamic condition. <Learning objective: Emergency clinicians should be aware that coronary malperfusion associated with aortic dissection can be improved by conservative management in some cases. Electrocardiogram-gated cardiac multidetector computed tomography is a useful tool for the diagnosis and clinical management of this condition.>."

    "abstract": "There is some evidence that weekend admission to the hospital is associated with worse outcomes compared with weekday admission. However, only a few studies have focused on weekend vs weekday surgery outcomes. This study aimed to determine whether there is a weekend effect on outcomes in the treatment of ruptured aortic aneurysms in Germany. Health insurance claims of Germany's third largest insurance provider, DAK-Gesundheit, were used to investigate short-term and long-term mortality after weekend vs weekday treatment of ruptured aortic aneurysm. Patients undergoing endovascular repair (ER) or open surgical repair (OSR) between January 2008 and December 2016 were included in the study. Both propensity score matching and regression methods were used to adjust for confounding. There were 1477 patients in the cohort, of whom 517 (35.0%) underwent ER and 960 (65.0%) OSR. Overall, 995 (67.4%) patients underwent an operation on weekdays (Monday to Thursday), and 482 (32.6%) patients underwent an operation on a weekend (Friday to Sunday). In multivariable models, patients who underwent an operation on a weekend were at higher risk of in-hospital death after OSR (49.2% vs 38.0%; odds ratio [OR], 1.61; P = .001), and there was a trend toward higher in-hospital mortality after ER (29.5% vs 21.2%; OR, 1.55; P = .056). The ER of thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic ruptures was associated with significantly higher in-hospital mortality compared with ER of abdominal aortic aneurysm (OR, 1.69; P = .026). Weekend repairs of ruptured aortic aneurysms are associated with worse in-hospital survival compared with weekday surgery. ER of thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic ruptures is associated with worse in-hospital survival compared with ER of ruptured abdominal aortic ruptures. This might be an international phenomenon requiring joint learning and action in times of centralization of aortic procedures."

We present a case of an 86-year-old man with ruptured type B aortic dissection after TEVAR. He received a successful stent-graft implantation of the descending aorta without any type of endoleak. After the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, he went into a shock state. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed a re-rupture of acute retrograde type B aortic dissection. The false lumen was patent and perforated to the left thorax. Left thoracotomy and descending aortic banding was performed. Descending aorta was encircled with a woven Dacron graft at the distal part of the rupture site to compress the patent false lumen. The bleeding was stopped, and the follow-up CT showed false lumen thrombosis. Descending aortic banding is one of the quick and effective open conversion techniques."

    "abstract": "Coronary malperfusion is one of the most dreadful complications of acute aortic dissection because it causes catastrophic acute myocardial infarction in patients who are already severely ill. Our strategy was as follows. After the administration of heparin, emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was urgently performed at the same time as starting to prepare the operating room. A stent was then placed to cover the full length of dissected coronary artery. Patients whose cardiac function improved after successful coronary artery reperfusion were transferred to the operating room to undergo central repair surgery. If the cardiac function did not recover even after coronary reperfusion, and the patient required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, we considered the best supportive care without performing central repair surgery. In patients with left coronary malperfusion, we believe that preoperative PCI must be performed immediately. Preoperative PCI might delay central repair surgery and potentially increase the risk of catastrophic cardiac tamponade. However, the benefit of PCI in preserving cardiac function exceeds the risk of cardiac tamponade. The indications of PCI before central repair in patients with right coronary malperfusion should be considered after assessing each patient's condition, including the presence or absence of cardiac tamponade and right ventricular infarction, left ventricular function, the immediate availability of cardiologists or cardiac surgeons, and the speed of preparing the operating room."

    "abstract": "Type A aortic dissection (TAAD) usually requires emergency open repair of the ascending aorta. In cases of diffuse dissection that spreads along the descending and abdominal aorta (type I, DeBakey classification), the risk of aneurysmal degeneration varies between 30% and 50% during 5 years and increases even higher during a longer follow-up. Those patients might require complex intervention to prevent aortic rupture. A combination of hybrid arch debranching and the extended provisional extension to induce complete attachment (e-PETTICOAT) technique might be an available alternative in such cases. This is the first report of the successful use of the e-PETTICOAT technique for treating degenerative, diffuse TAAD. Acute chest pain and syncope were the initial symptoms of diffuse TAAD in our 66-year-old female patient. Open replacement of the ascending aorta followed by surgical arch debranching was performed as a staged procedure. Unfortunately, progressive aneurysmal degeneration was revealed 6 months later in the thoracic, abdominal, and infrarenal aorta with the recurrence of chest and lumbar pain. Computed angiotomography revealed severe aneurysmal degeneration of aortic dissection in the thoracic and abdominal aorta. The e-PETTICOAT enabled good remodeling and stopped degeneration. At the 2-year follow-up, good remodeling with complete false lumen thrombosis and a stable aortic size were confirmed. Lifelong follow-up in extensive TAAD should be considered. The e-PETTICOAT technique is an available alternative to fenestrated endovascular aortic repair for degenerative TAAD, as it promotes favorable remodeling after successful surgery of the ascending aorta."

In this retrospective study of the authors' aortic surgery database, an exploration was made of factors related to early and long-term morbidity and mortality of patients who underwent this procedure. Between 2000 and 2009, a total of 200 consecutive patients (male:female ratio 4:1; mean age 56.2 ± 11.66 years) underwent the modified Bentall operation at the authors' institution, with a composite graft (mechanical valve) being used to correct aortic root pathology. All preoperative, perioperative and postoperative data, as well as long-term follow up data, were retrieved from the authors' aortic surgery database. Preoperative characteristics of the patients included elective and emergency operations (83.1% and 15.9%, respectively). Intraoperative and 30-day mortalities were 2% and 3.5%, respectively, while the rate of postoperative cerebrovascular events was 1.5%. Long-term survival at a mean follow up of 110 months for the elective and emergency groups was 88.6% and 71.9%, respectively (p = 0.007). Moreover, during the same period new cerebrovascular events were observed in 5.8% of cases. Predictive factors for late survival were type of surgery (elective versus emergency; p = 0.023), conduit size (≤23 mm versus >23 mm; p = 0.053) , age >65 years (p = 0.001), intensive care unit stay (days; p <0.001) and postoperative creatinine level (p = 0.002).

    "abstract": "As emergency repair for acute type A aortic dissection is improving, the reintervention rate increases. Over 10% of cases require an aortic reintervention, which should ideally be performed in an early stage to allow for positive aortic remodeling and to prevent limitations by the stiffened aortic flap. These reinterventions remain a surgical challenge and may come with complications. We provide a comprehensive overview of different management strategies and their success in treating aortic adverse remodelling, based on current evidence of the literature. Two meta-analyses and an additional literature search yielded comparable mortality rates between limited repair and extensive repair. Cardiopulmonary bypass time, cross clamping time and cardiac arrest time were significantly shorter in limited repairs. Reintervention rate was generally lower in extensive repair, although not always significant. In conclusion, the early aggressive approach may be useful to lower reintervention rates. However, it has not yet been proven to be more beneficial. It will be imperative to develop a patient-specific early stage prediction model for residual aortic reintervention."

Because of sinus tachycardia without any other electrocardiogram abnormalities, high NT-pro BNP level, and weakly positive cardiac troponin I and D-dimer levels, an aortic and pulmonary non ECG-gated CT-angiography was performed that excluded pulmonary embolism and aortic dissection. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a contained rupture of the non-coronary sinus of Valsalva aneurysm sized 23 to 24mm into the right atrium. According to the high rupture risk, patient had been immediately transferred in a cardiologic surgical center where transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and thoracic angiography ECG-gated Multiple Detector Computerized Tomography (ECG-gated MDCT) reinforced the diagnosis. Patient underwent surgical repair resection of the aneurysmal sac, which was described as \"tissue paper thin\" and at risk for impending rupture, without evidence of communication between the aorta and the right atrium. Anatomopathological examination described a thick sclerotic and oedematous aneurysm wall without inflammation, and bacteriological examination was negative. It is a rare case of contained rupture of the congenital non-coronary sinus of Valsalva aneurysm into the right atrium (Type IV of Sakakibara classification), with a high rupture risk. This case shows that the use ECG-gated-MDCT is more appropriate when aortic dissection is suspected, allowing a detailed analysis of aorta, especially the proximal portion which is more susceptible to motion artifacts."

Cerebral angiography showed known severe stenosis in the right common carotid artery and acute occlusion of the left common carotid artery. Enhanced computed tomography(CT) revealed Stanford type A acute aortic dissection. We judged an emergency surgery was not indicated for this comatose patient. Neurosurgeons placed stents into the left common and internal carotid arteries. The next day, the patient regained consciousness (GCS E4V2M6), and we performed ascending aorta replacement. There was an intimal tear in the ascending aorta and proximal end of the left carotid artery stent was visible in the aortic arch. Postoperative course was uneventful, and CT revealed successful aortic repair and patent stents in the left carotid artery. She was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital on postoperative day 44. Although stent insertion into carotid arteries in a patient with acute aortic dissection carries some risks such as making a new intimal tear or catheterizing in a false lumen, early cerebral reperfusion may improve prognosis of the patients with acute aortic dissection with cerebral malperfusion."

Similarly, when cardiac tamponade occurs in patients with type A acute aortic dissection, many patients die before reaching the hospital. We report a rare case in which chest compressions caused pericardial laceration that may have inadvertently played a life-saving role in releasing cardiac tamponade induced by acute aortic dissection. A 67-year-old woman developed cardiac arrest soon after complaining of epigastric pain, and after successful resuscitation by manual chest compression, she was transferred to our hospital. On arrival, the patient was 14 on the Glasgow Coma Scale. An ECG showed a normal sinus rhythm, and no arrhythmias or signs of myocardial ischemia were observed. A chest X-ray revealed left pleural effusion, while cardiomegaly and pneumothorax were not identified. Computed tomography revealed type A aortic dissection, mild pericardial effusion, and massive left pleural effusion. No pulmonary embolus was found on the CT. After drainage of bloody effusion from the left pleural space, an emergency operation was begun. During surgery, a pericardial laceration with communication to the left pleural space and a hemothorax were found; however, no cardiac injury was identified. No other intra-thoracic injuries or rupture of the aortic dissection causing the hemothorax were detected. Hemiarch replacement was performed without difficulty, but the patient died of multi-organ failure 30 days after surgery. We report a case of pericardial injury without skeletal fracture caused by chest compression. The pericardial laceration may have inadvertently served to release the cardiac tamponade induced by the acute aortic dissection, resulting in the hemothorax, and provided time to receive surgery."

The frozen elephant trunk (FET) technique in addition to ascending and arch repair promotes aortic remodelling in the descending aorta and thus may provide superior long-term results in terms of less secondary re-interventions and reduced mortality linked to the downstream aorta. Between October 2009 and December 2016, a total of 72 patients underwent emergent hybrid aortic repair using the FET for acute DeBakey type I aortic dissection at our centre. Data were analysed from our prospectively collected database and clinical and imaging mid-term follow-up was obtained. Implant success was 98.6% with an overall 30-day-mortality of 15.3%. New postoperative stroke was seen in 2.8%, new spinal cord injury in 4.2%. In follow-up (mean 37.8±21.2 months) cumulative survival was 75.0% with freedom from distal reintervention in 96.7% and aortic remodelling rate in the descending aorta in 96.5%. Hybrid aortic repair using the FET in acute DeBakey type I aortic dissection does not elevate the perioperative risk of mortality and provides excellent aortic remodelling with low distal re-intervention rate in mid-term follow-up."

The aim of this study is to describe the changes in intrinsic coagulation factor XII, explore its function and find a new target for the treatment of coagulopathy during surgery. Eighty-eight patients undergoing emergent surgery for AAD were enrolled. Changes in the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways were evaluated at 5 different timepoints during the perioperative period by measuring intrinsic coagulation factor XII, extrinsic coagulation factor VII and some intrinsic upstream stimulating factors. The 88 patients were also divided into two groups according to whether reoperation for coagulopathy was required after surgery. Both coagulation factors XII and VII demonstrated a significant and similar change during the perioperative period. These factors decreased significantly during hypothermia circulation arrest (P<0.001) and recovered to normal levels by 24 hours after surgery. Among the intrinsic upstream stimulating factors, bradykinin (BK) demonstrated a similar changing trend with coagulation factors XII and VII, while other stimulating factors did not. However, compared with factor VII, factor XII demonstrated a greater decline during surgery. The proportion of decline of factor XII from anesthesia induction to hypothermia circulation arrest was 42%, whereas the proportion of decline of factor VII during the same period was 20% (P<0.001). Moreover, factor VII recovered to preoperative levels 4 hours after surgery with a relatively faster speed (P<0.001) while factor XII had not recovered (P=0.010). The independent t-test and Wilcoxon test showed that coagulation factor XII levels during hypothermia circulation arrest (P=0.002), total dosage of fibrinogen (P=0.027), total dosage of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) (P=0.006) and total dosage of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) (P=0.022) during the perioperative period were significantly different between the patients who did or did not require reoperation for coagulopathy. Multivariable logistic regression analysis suggested that the factor XII level during hypothermia circulation arrest was an independent risk factor for reoperation for coagulopathy [odds ratio (OR): 1.342, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.058-1.570; P=0.012]. Factor XII levels are more influenced by surgery and require a longer period of time to recover to preoperative levels compared with factor VII, and the level of factor XII during hypothermia circulation arrest might be an independent risk factor for reoperation for coagulopathy. Therefore, supplementation of coagulation factor XII and its upstream stimulating factors might be a promising therapeutic modality in the future."

Patients with more than three of the following six modalities were defined as being frail: age older than 75 years, preoperative requirement of assistance in daily living, body mass index less than 18.5 kg/m2, female, history of major stroke, and chronic kidney disease greater than class 3b. Twenty-three patients (20.2%) were diagnosed with frailty (group F), while 91 patients (79.8%) were not (group N). Early clinical outcomes, major postoperative complications, postoperative recovery of activity, and early or mid-term survival were evaluated. Although early clinical outcomes and the prevalence of major postoperative complications were similar in both groups, postoperative activity of daily living (ADL), such as the rate of being ambulatory on discharge (p < 0.05) and home discharge (p < 0.01), was significantly lower in group F than in group N. A Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that 1- and 5-year survival rates were similar in groups F (85.9 and 76.4%, respectively) and N (86.0 and 76.9%, respectively). Preoperative frailty in AAAD surgical patients has potential as a prognostic factor that affects delays in ADL recovery, but does not influence the early or mid-term clinical outcomes of prompt surgical strategies for life rescue in AAAD patients with frailty."

This study was a retrospective analysis of cases of TAAD, as well as controls, undergoing evaluation for TAAD with CT aortography, presenting to 21 emergency departments within an integrated health system between 2007 and 2015. AscAo diameters were determined using axial noncontrast CT images at the level of the right main pulmonary artery by two readers. AscAo diameters were additionally normalized for age, sex, and body surface area (assessed by a Z-score, which is the number of standard deviations between the observed and expected AscAo diameters). Overall model discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Comparative discrimination was assessed using both the change in AUC (∆AUC) and the continuous net reclassification index (NRI). A total of 230 cases of TAAD and 325 controls were included in the study. The median ages for cases and controls were 65 and 62 years, and the median AscAo diameters were 50 and 35 mm, respectively. The raw and normalized AscAo diameters demonstrated similarly excellent discrimination (AUCs of 0.96 vs. 0.97, respectively; ∆AUC = 0.01, p = 0.09) and an NRI of 0.30 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.13-0.47), both indicating small incremental improvements in classification with the use of the normalized AscAo measures. A raw AscAo diameter of 34 mm and a normalized Z-score of 1.84 both yielded 100% sensitivity for TAAD, with respective specificities of 35% (95% CI = 29.6%-40.2%) and 67% (95% CI = 61.7%-72.2%). Nearly all patients with TAAD appear to have enlarged AscAo diameters as measured by noncontrast CT, whereas most patients with suspected but absent TAAD have relatively normal AscAo diameters. Both raw and normalized AscAo measures provided relatively comparable discriminatory value. If validated, these data may be useful in adjudicating risk among patients with suspected TAAD in whom a criterion standard test is unavailable, nondiagnostic, or contraindicated."

All patients with AAD were admitted within 72 h of onset. Serum metabolomics profiles were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and the data were analysed by principal component analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis. A total of 17 metabolites differing between the control and AAD groups were finally screened and identified as lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC) and sphingolipids including sphinganine, phytosphingosine, sphingomyelin, and ceramide. Compared with those in the healthy control group, LPC levels were significantly lower in both the Stanford type A and type B AAD groups. Interestingly, sphingolipids, including sphinganine, phytosphingosine, and ceramide, were remarkably reduced in the Stanford type A AAD group, but not in the Stanford type B AAD group. Subgroup analysis showed that the changes in LPC and sphingolipid levels were unrelated to hypertension or gender. The present results indicate that LPCs and sphingolipids are significantly altered in patients with AAD, and several sphingolipids, such as sphinganine, phytosphingosine, and ceramide, were dramatically decreased in patients with Stanford type A AAD. A combination of these two families of metabolites could serve as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of AAD and distinguishing between Stanford type A and Stanford type B."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of repeat interventions on the aorta and aortic valve after surgery for acute Stanford type A aortic dissection. The hospital records of patients who underwent repeat surgical intervention between April 2011 and March 2017 for late complications after acute type A aortic dissection repair were retrospectively reviewed. We identified 17 patients with mean age of 62 ± 8 years; 13 were men. The mean interval from the initial emergency aortic repair to the repeat intervention was 5.8 ± 5.4 years (range 133 days-16.6 years). Ten patients had dilatation or rupture of the residual type B aortic dissection; six of them had retrograde type A aortic dissection at the onset and did not undergo resection of the primary entry. Five patients had a pseudoaneurysm at the anastomosis; four of them were receiving anticoagulation medication. Three patients had aortic regurgitation; two of them were associated with the gelatin-resorcinol-formaldehyde glue that was used during the initial surgery. There was no early mortality after repeat intervention and no late death after a mean follow-up period of 3.3 ± 2.0 years. Repeat surgical intervention on the aorta and aortic valve after repair of acute type A aortic dissection had favorable early and mid-term outcomes and was not associated with early or late death. Long-term follow-up with imaging and echocardiography was considered to be essential for early detection of residual type B dilatation, anastomotic pseudoaneurysm, and aortic regurgitation after initial aortic repair."

    "abstract": "To evaluate the efficacy of the less invasive hybrid zone 0 (Z0) total aortic arch repair (HAR, ascending repair + complete debranching + thoracic endovascular aortic repair [TEVAR]) without deep hypothermic circulatory arrest in management of DeBakey type I aortic dissection (IAD). The adverse outcome was defined as a single composite endpoint comprising peri-operative mortality, permanent neurological deficit, and renal failure necessitating haemodialysis at discharge. A retrospective review of prospectively collected data was conducted of 120 consecutive patients (mean EuroSCORE = 11.6%) with IAD undergoing HAR (urgent/emergency, n = 97, 80.8%) involving reconstruction of the ascending aorta (zone 0) and total arch exclusion with TEVAR during a 7.5 year period. Multivariable analysis of 27 potential pre-operative and intra-operative risk factors was performed to examine the early composite endpoint and short and long-term overall mortality. The total early (30 day or in hospital) mortality was 9.2% (n = 11). The incidence of the composite endpoint was 11.7% (n = 14). On multivariable analysis, malperfusion syndromes were predictors of the composite endpoint (odds ratio [OR], 4.789; 95% CI 1.362-16.896; p = .015), and previous cerebrovascular accident (OR, 13.74; 95% CI 2.330-81.039; p = .004) and myocardial ischaemia time (OR, 1.038; 95% CI 1.015-1.061; p = .001) predicted short and long-term overall mortality. The overall survival was 84.7% during a median follow up of 3.4 years. Freedom from late aortic adverse events was 93.1% at 5 years, including secondary aortic intervention and endoleak. The maximum diameters of the true lumen increased significantly in stented thoracic (14.4 ± 6.5 mm to 29.7 ± 5.3 mm, p < .001), lower thoracic (14.2 ± 6 mm to 21.6 ± 7.2 mm, p < .001) and abdominal (11.7 ± 4.8 mm to 17.4 ± 4.1 mm, p < .001) aorta. Complete thrombosis of the peri-stent false lumen was achieved in 88.2% of CT scans (82/93) performed a mean of 12 ± 17 months (median 5 months; 25-75% quartile, 2-12 months) post-operatively. IAD was treated safely and durably by Z0 HAR, and peri-operative mortality and morbidity were not substantially higher despite the older age and high risk of patients."

    "abstract": "As invasive cardiovascular care has become increasingly complex, cardiac perforation leading to hemopericardium is a progressively prevalent complication. We sought to assess the frequency, etiology, and outcomes of hemorrhagic pericardial effusions managed through a nonsurgical echo-guided percutaneous strategy. Over a 10-year period (January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2016), 1097 unique patients required pericardiocentesis for clinically important pericardial effusions. Of these 411 had drainage of hemorrhagic effusions (defined as a pericardial hemoglobin level >50% of serum hemoglobin or frank blood in the setting of cardiac perforation). Clinical characteristics, echocardiographic data, details of the procedure, and outcomes were determined. Median patient age was 67 years (interquartile range, 56-76 years), and 60% were men. The procedure was emergent in 83% and elective in 17%. The site of pericardiocentesis was determined by echo-guidance in all: 68% from the left para-apical region, 18% from the left or right parasternal areas, and 14% were subxyphoid. Half (n=215 [52%]) occurred after cardiac perforation with percutaneous interventional procedure (ablation, n=94; device lead implantation, n=65; percutaneous coronary intervention, n=22; other, n=34), whereas 30% followed cardiac or thoracic surgery. Pericardial fluid volume drained was 546±440 mL. In 94% of cases, echo-guided pericardiocentesis was the only treatment of the effusion needed, whereas definitive surgery was required in 25 (6%) cases for persistent bleeding or acute management of the underlying etiology. There was no procedural mortality. Late mortality was better for hemorrhagic effusions compared with a contemporary cohort with nonhemorrhagic effusions. Echocardiographic guidance allows rapid successful pericardiocentesis in the setting of hemopericardium related to microperforation with interventional procedures, malignancy, or pericarditis, with most not requiring surgical intervention. Surgery should remain the first-line approach for aortic dissection or myocardial rupture."

    "title": "Hemodynamic changes lead to alterations in aortic diameters and may challenge further stent graft sizing in acute aortic syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Precise stent graft sizing in Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is crucial to receive optimal long-term results. Computed tomography (CT), as the current standard in assessing aortic diameters (ADs), is often performed at initial diagnosis. Since several acute aortic diseases are associated with blood loss and/or volume re-distribution, assessed AD might be influenced by impaired hemodynamic conditions. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) offers real-time assessment, especially after hemodynamic restoration, and might help for stent graft choice. We investigated the correlation between CT and later IVUS measurements in elective (n=83) and emergency patients (n=32) at the level distal to the left subclavian artery (LSA), a frequent proximal landing zone in TEVAR. Patients were grouped depending on their shock index (heart rate/systolic blood pressure): emergency patients with diagnosis of acute aortic syndrome, urgently required treatment after admission and had a shock index >1, otherwise were grouped as elective. Basic hemodynamics were assessed for both groups at admission and at definite IVUS-procedure. At time of admission the emergency group showed lower blood pressure (99±19.8 vs. 141±24 mmHg; P=0.001) and higher heart rate (98±13 vs. 70±12 bpm; P=0.001) compared to elective patients. By hemodynamic stabilization comparable blood pressure and heart rate were achieved in both groups at time of IVUS. In the emergency group, we found a significantly increase in AD after hemodynamic stabilization, whereas the diameters did not change in the elective group (IVUSmeanvs. CTmean: 5.1±1.0 vs. 0.4±2.2 mm; P=0.001 and IVUSminvs. CTmean: 3.9±1.3 vs. -0.3±2.2 mm; P=0.011). IVUS for stent graft sizing is a valuable approach during TEVAR, especially in the light of emergency treatment by offering real-time assistance. Impaired hemodynamic conditions might lead to relevant changes in AD and may strongly influence stent graft choice. In these cases, careful stent graft selection might contribute to avoidance of stent graft related complication."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a clinically \"silent,\" but emergent and life-threatening cardiovascular disease, and hereditary factors play an important etiologic role in the development of AAD. The purposes of this study are to definitize the diagnostic yield of 59 AAD patients, investigate the molecular pathological spectrum of AAD by NGS, and explore the future preclinical prospects of genetic diagnosis on AAD high-risk groups. We performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) based on screening of the 69 currently aortic dissections/aneurysms-associated genes on 59 sporadic AAD samples from South China. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was constructed to compare the event-free survival depending on variant number. Overall, 67 variants were detected in 39 patients, among which 4 patients were identified with pathogenic variants and 13 patients were diagnosed with likely pathogenic variants. Seventeen genotype positive patients were identified in aggregate, and the diagnostic yield of our study is 28.8%. All genotype-positive variants were distributed in 11 genes, FBN1 variants were in the largest number among genotype-positive variants, which were detected for 4 times, ACTA2 for 3 times, ABCC6 and TGFBR1 twice, and NOS3, MYLK, XYLT1, TIMP4, TGFBR2, CNTN3, and PON1 once. Individuals with three or more variants showed shorter mean event-free survival than patients with fewer variants. Our observations broaden the genetic pathological spectrum of AAD. Furthermore, our research uncovered two susceptibility genes FBN1 and ACTA2 for Stanford type A AAD patients. Finally, our study concluded that the number of variants an individual harbored was an important consideration in risk stratification for individualized prediction and disease diagnosis."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Aortic dissection presents with acute chest or back pain and is associated with high mortality. We present a case of aortic dissection with an atypical presentation in a peritoneal dialysis patient, and the challenges met with peritoneal dialysis. CASE REPORT A 53-year-old African American male presented with progressively worsening exertional dyspnea and orthopnea for 3 days without any history of chest pain. His chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary edema. He was admitted with a diagnosis of heart failure. Bedside echocardiogram revealed severe aortic regurgitation and concern for possible aortic dissection. Computed tomography of chest with contrast showed Stanford type-A aortic dissection extending from the aortic valve to the level of the left subclavian artery. Emergent surgery was performed. Postoperatively, the patient was managed in surgical and trauma intensive care unit to keep the blood pressure in the desired range. Initially, he was started on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis and later on transitioned to intermittent hemodialysis. He was switched back to peritoneal dialysis after 6 weeks of surgery. CONCLUSIONS Atypical presentation of a silent aortic dissection without chest pain in the setting of renal failure and other co-morbidities emphasizes that dialysis patients are different from the general population. Sometimes the management needs to be modified from the conventional ways to achieve the high level of success."

    "abstract": "Stress cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) has become increasingly used in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with symptoms concerning for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We hypothesized that CMR detects a number of alternative diagnoses (diagnoses other than ACS that could explain symptoms) and incidental findings in patients presenting to the ED for potential ACS. We prospectively enrolled adult patients who presented to an academic ED from 2011 to 2015 for possible ACS and subsequently had an adenosine stress perfusion CMR as part of their diagnostic evaluation. All medical charts were reviewed to verify accurate prospective data collection and to collect follow-up data. A total of 391 patients were included. On stress CMR, abnormalities attributable to coronary artery disease (CAD) were found in 106 (27.1%) of patients. Previously undiagnosed moderate to severe valvular disease was the most common non-CAD cardiac finding, occurring in 20 (5.1%) cases. Other alternative diagnoses were rare with 7 cases of cardiomyopathy, 1 case of aortic aneurysm, 1 case of aortic dissection, 1 case of acute myocarditis, 3 cases of pericarditis, and 2 cases of moderate pleural effusion. Cardiac incidental findings were rare. Extracardiac incidental findings were found in 79 patients (20.2%). Only 18.6% of the patients recommended for follow-up imaging had this completed within 1 year after CMR. This experience suggests that stress CMR is useful in not only diagnosing symptomatic CAD but also potentially important non-CAD-related disease. These factors may impact their use in ED-based ACS workups."

    "abstract": "The aim was to analyse early and late outcomes in patients undergoing thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for acute or subacute non-traumatic type B aortic dissection (TBAD), with the particular aims of identifying prognostic morphological predictors, and to assess the magnitude of the impact of the timing of TEVAR. This was a retrospective, two centre, population based consecutive case series. The study group consisted of all the 53 patients undergoing TEVAR for complicated TBAD in Stockholm during the 12 year period 2004-2015. Demographic data, risk factors, operative, and outcome variables were registered and analysed. The CT scans were thoroughly retrospectively examined. Nearly half (24 patients; 45%) underwent TEVAR within 48 h of the onset of the initial symptoms, another 20 within 2 weeks, and nine in the subacute phase (15-90 days). The median age was 63 years (range 32-88) and 20 patients (38%) were women. The 30 day mortality was 17% (nine patients). Eight of these nine patients were treated within the first 48 h; urgent intervention (0-48 h) was associated with increased mortality (crude OR 14.0; 95% CI 1.6-122). All the nine patients had a false lumen area (FLA) at the level of the tracheal bifurcation exceeding 50% of the aortic cross sectional area at that segment, a finding significantly associated with increased mortality (p = .04), with a 25% 30 day mortality if the FLA > 50% (n = 36) at that segment, but 0% if the FLA was <50%. Overall the one year survival was 79% and five year survival 65%. All the early deaths demonstrated a FLA >50% of the total aortic cross sectional area at the level of the tracheal bifurcation. Patients needing urgent TEVAR had markedly worse outcome. The first finding may become an additional tool for future risk stratification."

    "abstract": "Fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) grafts have a 10- to 12-week manufacturing time and are generally not available for emergency cases of symptomatic or ruptured aortic aneurysm. In the absence of other alternatives, conventional off-the-shelf stent grafts can be modified by trained operators to treat these complex cases. The aim of this study is to present a single-center experience of physician-modified FEVAR. A retrospective review was performed of all physician-modified FEVAR identified from the hospital endovascular database at a single tertiary referral center between September 1996 and September 2017. Eight cases of urgent or emergency endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with physician-modified grafts were identified. Mean follow-up was 44 weeks (range: 5-106 weeks). Outcomes for all implanted grafts (7/8 cases) included 100% technical success, 14% rate of endoleak, no procedure-related complications, no adverse visceral events, 0% 30-day mortality and 100% 1-year target vessel patency, and freedom from aneurysm-related death. There was a 14% (1/7 cases) per patient reintervention rate. Modifying EVAR grafts is a highly technical process requiring meticulous planning and extensive elective experience with FEVAR. The current series demonstrates that physician modification of endografts for urgent or emergency abdominal aortic aneurysm repair is feasible and a safe alternative to open surgical aneurysm repair."

In case of organ malperfusion, various endovascular therapies, e. g., endoluminal fenestration of dissection flap, thoracic stent-graft implantation (TEVAR) or branch vessel stenting, are available. In the case of aortic rupture, TEVAR has become the standard owing to its lower mortality compared to open surgical repair. For the treatment of complicated type B aortic dissection, a number of endovascular options are available. For optimal treatment, profound knowledge of the disease, of the diagnostic workup, and of the interventional procedures is mandatory."

Later, due to clinical deterioration and the differential possibility of a pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection, a CT scan was performed which revealed large pericardial effusion. This, together with a dilated vena cava inferior and portal system, raised the suspicion of cardiac tamponade. The diagnosis was confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). In retrospect, the ECG at admission showed a sinus tachycardia, low-voltage QRS complexes and a total electrical alternans corresponding with the swinging heart seen on TTE. An electrical alternans on ECG is an important diagnostic clue but is often missed, causing an unnecessary delay to proper diagnostic and therapeutic measures."

A total of 222 patients (111 cases and 111 controls) were analysed. On univariate analysis systolic BP differential >20 mm Hg (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.39 to 5.25) was significantly associated with AAD. Pulse deficit (diagnostic OR (DOR) 28.9) in isolation had better diagnostic accuracy than systolic BP differential >20 mm Hg in isolation (DOR 2.71) or combined with systolic BP differential >20 mm Hg (DOR 4.2). Bilateral systolic BP differentials >20 mm Hg are associated with non-traumatic AAD. However, the poor diagnostic accuracy and potential variability in measurement limits its clinical usefulness."

An analysis was performed of the dissections according to gender, age group, Stanford/De Bakey classification, and mortality rate 6 months after diagnosis. Statistical analysis was performed by obtaining the Chi squared index for the independent variables of gender, Marfan syndrome, systemic arterial hypertension, as well as calcified atheromatous disease in association with dissection subtypes, re-entry sites, and hypo-perfusion signs.

There was a significant association, with a marginal P in patients with Marfan syndrome and Stanford subtypes of AD (P=.0506). There was a significant association in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm, when compared with Stanford subtypes of AD (P=.047104). AD is an emergency in which diagnosis and timely management are essential to improve prognosis. In the sample presented here, a significant association was found in patients with a history of Marfan syndrome and abdominal aneurysms with dissections according to the Stanford classification. The rest of the independent variables did not show any significant association, probably related to the size of the sample."

The aim of this study was to evaluate early outcome and short- and long-term survival of patients under and above 65 years of age. Two hundred and forty patients with Stanford A AAD underwent aortic surgical repair from January 2006 to April 2015 in our center. After statistical analysis and logistic regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival estimation was performed, with up to 9-year follow-up, comprising patients under and above 65 years of age. The proportion of patients above 65 years of age suffering from Stanford A AAD was 50% (n=120). The group of patients above 65 years of age compared to the group under 65 years of age showed statistically significant differences in terms of higher odds ratios (OR) for hypertension (p=0.012), peripheral vascular disease (p=0.026) and tachyarrhythmia absoluta (p=0.004). Patients over 65 years of age also showed significantly poorer short- and long-term survival. Our subgroup analysis revealed that male patients (Breslow p=0.001, Log-Rank p=0.001) and patients suffering with hypertension (Breslow p=0.003, Log-Rank p=0.001) were reasonable for these results whereas younger and older female patients showed similar short- and long-term outcome (Breslow p=0.926, Log-Rank p=0.724). After stratifying all patients into 4 age groups (<45; 55-65; 65-75; >75years), short-term survival of the patients appeared to be significantly poorer with increasing age (Breslow p=0.026, Log-Rank p=0.008) whereas long-term survival of patients free from cerebrovascular events (Breslow p=0.0494, Log-Rank p=0.489) remained similar. All patients referred to our hospital for repair of Stanford A AAD with higher age had poorer short- and long-term survival, caused by male patients and patients suffering from hypertension, whereas survival of women and survival free from cerebrovascular events of the entire patient cohort was similar, irrespective of age."

    "abstract": "Type A aortic dissection is a rare but important cardiac surgical emergency. Few reports exist in the literature describing anterior spinal artery syndrome as a presenting feature. We report a case of anterior spinal artery syndrome due to aortic dissection in a patient with Marfan syndrome caused by a novel fibrillin mutation. A 53-year old female presented with chest pain and sudden-onset paralysis. Neurological examination revealed normal upper limb examination, reduced lower limb power and reflexes but normal sensation. CT scanning revealed type A acute aortic dissection which was treated with emergent cardiac surgical repair. At clinic follow up 3 years later, signs of Marfan syndrome were opportunistically noted and genetic testing revealed a novel mutation in the Fibrillin 1 gene. This case emphasises the importance of a good initial clinical assessment, including thorough neurological examination, as well as a low threshold of clinical suspicion for an aortic dissection in such a constellation of symptoms. The importance of family history should also be emphasised given the coincidental diagnosis of Marfan syndrome in a first-degree relative. Furthermore, this case illustrates the classical signs of anterior spinal artery syndrome."

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in surgical techniques and perioperative management, the surgical mortality of acute type A aortic dissection remains high. In a hospital with few acute type A aortic dissection operations, we retrospectively investigated whether simplified surgical approach could obtain proper surgical outcomes. Between October 2007 and December 2016, we performed emergency surgery in 99 patients who had acute type A aortic dissection, including replacement of the hemi-arch in 62 patients (63%) and total arch in 32 patients (32%) and aortic root surgery in 7 patients (7%). Surgical strategy has been simplified over time. We performed right axillary artery perfusion in 61 patients (62%) and antegrade cerebral perfusion in 78 patients (79%). During the last 3 years, in-hospital mortality was decreased to 4% (2/47). Preoperative unresolved shock was an independent predictor of hospital death. Although the patients with total arch replacement or aortic root surgery had a mean significantly long cardiopulmonary bypass or circulatory arrest time, in-hospital mortality or neurologic complications was not increased. Simplified surgical approach could provide a reasonable surgical outcome in acute type A aortic dissection surgery in a center with a small volume of acute aortic dissection surgery."

On arrival, chest X-ray showed prominent aortic arch without cardiomegaly. CT of the abdomen/pelvis showed aortic dissection in descending aorta without rupture. CT of the chest displayed sparing of ascending and aortic arch. Ultrasound Doppler of the kidney displayed mild renal artery stenosis. Differential diagnosis was acute appendicitis, acute ureteric and severe gastroenteritis. The patient was started on oral blood pressure (BP) medicine to titrate off intravenous nicardipine and esmolol drip. After 10 days, he was switched to oral BP medicine. His leg pain was resolved with normal palpable pulse. One week later, his kidney function worsened. Thus, Lasix and minoxidil were stopped. The patient had no chest/abdominal pain and was tolerating the medicine well during his 2-week follow-up. Acute aortic dissection can be a fatal clinical emergency.

    "abstract": "Stanford type A acute aortic dissection requires emergency surgery. Because patients with ischemic stroke as a complication of Stanford type A acute aortic dissection do not often complain of chest or back pain, probably due to consciousness disturbance, amnesia, or aphasia, a fatal course following inappropriate intravenous rt-PA therapy and delay of appropriate surgical treatment sometimes occur. When treating any suspected stroke patients, emergency services and initial urgent care doctors should always suspect aortic dissection. Even in the absence of chest or back pain, the initial urgent care doctor needs to immediately perform chest contrast CT if suspecting aortic dissection from blood pressure laterality or upper mediastinal widening on chest X-ray. Whenever aortic dissection cannot be ruled out from initial clinical information, the initial urgent care doctor should evaluate the common carotid artery (CCA). Dissection extension to the CCA or flow abnormality of the CCA is often detected if aortic dissection is a cause of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Head CT or MRI including vascular imaging is preferable. D-dimer should be measured in hospitals where available. As soon as aortic dissection is identified, the initial urgent care doctor needs to consult with cardiovascular surgeons or cardiologists for appropriate treatment."

The technical success was 100%; 86.3% of patients (19/22) were treated percutaneously. Thirteen patients (59%) received a single endograft, 8 (36%) received 2 endografts, and 1 received 3 endografts. The endograft diameters ranged between 28 and 46 mm. Two dissection patients received additional distal bare metal true lumen stents. Eleven patients required additional drainage of thoracic hematoma. Three primary percutaneous sites (15.7%) required surgical revision. No spinal cord ischemic or renal complications were observed. Stroke was observed in 2 patients (9%), both with full coverage of left subclavian artery origin. Four patients (18%) required tracheostomy with prolonged respiratory support (range 10-15 days).

This study was performed to determine risk factors for CVI associated with ATBAD and, in particular, the possible contributory role of aggressive anti-impulse therapy. A retrospective review of all patients presenting to a tertiary medical center with an ATBAD between January 2003 and October 2012 was conducted. All CVIs were adjudicated by a vascular neurologist and assigned a probable cause. The initial intensity of anti-impulse therapy was defined as the difference in mean arterial pressure (ΔMAP) from presentation to subsequent admission to the intensive care unit. A total of 112 patients were identified. The average age was 61 years; 64% were male, and 59% were African American. Twenty patients required operative intervention (14 thoracic endovascular aortic repairs and 6 open). CVI occurred in 13 patients (11.6%): 9 were hypoperfusion related (6 diffuse hypoxic brain injuries and 3 watershed infarcts), 2 were procedure related (both thoracic endovascular aortic repairs), 1 was an intracranial hemorrhage on presentation, and 1 was a probable embolic stroke on presentation. CVI patients had demographics and comorbidities comparable to those of the non-CVI patients. CVI was associated with operative intervention (54% vs 13%; P = .002). Thirty-day mortality was significantly higher in CVI patients (54% vs 6%; P < .001). Patients who suffered a hypoperfusion brain injury had a higher MAP on presentation to the emergency department (142 mm Hg vs 120 mm Hg; P = .034) and a significantly greater reduction in MAP (ΔMAP 49 mm Hg vs 15 mm Hg; P < .001) by the time they reached the intensive care unit compared with the non-CVI patients. In our series, CVI in ATBAD is more frequent than previously reported and is associated with increased mortality. The most common causes are related to cerebral hypoperfusion. Higher MAP on presentation and greater decline in MAP are associated risk factors for hypoperfusion-related CVI. A less aggressive approach to lowering MAP in ATBAD warrants further study in an attempt to reduce CVI in ATBAD."

    "title": "Anomaly of Haughton type D left cervical aortic arch in combination with type B dissection: case report and literature review.",
    "abstract": "The anomaly of cervical aortic arch is a rare phenomenon first described by Reid in 1914 and categorized by Haughton in 1975. The left cervical aortic arch Type D consisting of an ipsilateral descending aorta and coarctation or aneurysmatic formation of the arch demonstrates a complicated form requiring surgical management. Because of its rarity and unspecific symptoms only few cases are documented with the focus on surgical management. A 43-year old, asymptomatic woman presented with a mediastinal mass overlapping the aortic arch region in a routine x-ray. For verification, a computed tomography was performed and revealed incidentally a type B dissection originating from an aneurysm of a left cervical arch with a maximum diameter of 6 cm. Because of the huge diameter and the potential risk of rupture, an urgent surgical repair was planned. Surgical access was performed through median sternotomy and an additional left lateral thoracic incision through the fourth intercostal space. Simultaneously to the preparation, partial cardiopulmonary bypass was installed in the left groin. After preparation of the recurrent and phrenic nerve and the supraaortic branches, the descending aorta was clamped. Before the distal anastomosis to a straight graft, we performed a fenestration of the dissection membrane about a length of 5 cm to preserve the perfusion of both lumina. Then, the straight graft was sutured to the proximal part of descending aorta. The left axillary artery originated directly from the aneurysm and was dissected and reimplanted with a separate 8 mm sidegraft to the straight graft between the distal arch and proximal descending aorta. The patient was extubated on first postoperative day and recovered well. The left cervical aortic arch type D is a rare disease, which is prone to aneurysm formation due to abnormal flow patterns and tortuosity of the aorta. The difficulty lays in the identification of the pathology, especially in the physical examination, since a pulsating mass or cervical murmur seem to be the most specific symptoms in the majority of young, female patients. If diagnosed, surgical therapy with resection of the aneurysm and reimplantation of the axillary artery under cardiopulmonary bypass demonstrates the treatment of choice."

    "title": "[Aortic dissection].",
    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition due to a tear in the intimal layer of the aorta or bleeding within the aortic wall, resulting in the separation of the different layers of the aortic wall. Among the risk factors, age, hypertension, dyslipidemia and genetic disorders of the connective tissue have been identified. A prompt diagnosis and an adequate treatment are important in the management of affected patients. The type of treatment depends on the location and extension of the dissection. Open surgical repair is most commonly used for dissections involving the ascending aorta and the aortic arch, whereas endovascular intervention is indicated for descending aorta dissections that are complicated. In this paper, we will review the epidemiology, and physiopathology of aortic dissection and describe the appropriate management for each type of dissection (open surgery, endovascular or medical treatment). La dissection aortique est une pathologie grave et potentiellement mortelle. Elle résulte d’une déchirure intimale ou d’un saignement dans la paroi aortique, qui entraîne une séparation au sein des différentes couches de cette dernière. Parmi les facteurs de risque de cette pathologie, citons l’âge, l’hypertension artérielle, la dyslipidémie, et les atteintes génétiques du tissu conjonctif. Un diagnostic précis et une prise en charge adéquate et rapide sont déterminants dans le management des patients. Le type de traitement est conditionné par la localisation et l’extension de la dissection. La chirurgie ouverte est généralement indiquée dans les atteintes de l’aorte ascendante et de l’arche aortique, tandis que l’approche endovasculaire sera privilégiée dans les dissections de l’aorte thoracique descendante compliquées. Dans cet article, nous ferons un rappel succinct de l’épidémiologie et de la physiopathologie des dissections aortiques, puis nous décrirons la prise en charge médicale, chirurgicale ouverte et endovasculaire."

A linear regression analysis was performed in monsoonal climate epidemiological survey for a period of four years on the impact of meteorological factors (minimal temperature, mean temperature, maximal temperature, average daily surface temperature, day temperature range, relative humidity, mean wind speed, and atmospheric pressure) and PM2.5 concentration on the daily incidences of acute aortic dissections. Meteorological variables and PM2.5 concentration were retrieved on a daily basis from Beijing Regional Climate Center and the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China's website, and the daily incidences of acute aortic dissections were retrieved from the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System in the Emergency and Critical Care Center of Beijing Anzhen Hospital. During the study period (from January 2011 to December 2014), 1164 patients were identified as having acute aortic dissections. The corresponding incidences in spring and autumn were 0.96 and 1.00, respectively, which significantly higher than that in summer and winter. The incidences of acute aortic dissection in a day could be predicted by diurnal temperature range (DTR) using the following linear multiple regression models: incidences of acute aortic dissection = 0.543 + 0.025 × DTR. This is the first study to show an attributable effect of DTR on acute aortic events in monsoonal climate.

    "abstract": "Limited intimal tears (LITs) of the aorta (Class 3 dissection variant) are the least common form of aortic pathology in patients presenting with acute aortic syndrome (AAS). LITs are difficult to detect on imaging and may be underappreciated. This study sought to describe the frequency, pathology, treatment, and outcome of LITs compared with other AAS, and to demonstrate that LITs can be detected pre-operatively by contemporary imaging. The authors retrospectively reviewed 497 patients admitted for 513 AAS events at a single academic aortic center between 2003 and 2012. AAS were classified into classic dissection (AD), intramural hematoma, LIT, penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer, and rupturing thoracic aortic aneurysm. The prevalence, pertinent risk factors, and detailed imaging findings with surgical and pathological correlation of LITs are described. Management, early outcomes, and late mortality are reported. Among 497 patients with AAS, the authors identified 24 LITs (4.8% of AAS) in 16 men and 8 women (17 type A, 7 type B). Patients with LITs were older than those with AD, and type A LITs had similarly dilated ascending aortas as type A AD. Three patients presented with rupture. Eleven patients underwent urgent surgical aortic replacement, and 2 patients underwent endovascular repair. Medial degeneration was present in all surgical specimens. In-hospital mortality was 4% (1 of 24), and in total, 5 patients with LIT died subsequently at 1.5 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.3 to 2.5 years). Computed tomography imaging detected all but 1 LIT, best visualized on volume-rendered images. LITs are rare acute aortic lesions within the dissection spectrum, with similar presentation, complications, and outcomes compared with AD and intramural hematoma. Awareness of this lesion allows pre-operative diagnosis using high-quality computed tomography angiography."

Patients were divided into three groups comprising isolated ascending aorta, proximal aortic arch, and distal aortic arch entry tear site and were followed up for up to 9 years. Thirty-day mortality as well as major cerebrovascular events were significantly different between the three groups (p = 0.007 and p = 0.048, respectively). Overall cumulative short- and long-term survival of all patients revealed significant differences (Log-Rank p = 0.002), whereas survival of all patients free from major cerebrovascular events was similar (Log-Rank p = 0.780). Subgroup analysis of short- and long-term survival of patients showed significant differences in terms of men (Log-Rank p = 0.043), women (Log-Rank p = 0.004), patients over 65 years of age (Log-Rank p = 0.007), and hypertensive patients (Log-Rank p = 0.003). Kaplan-Meier survival estimation plots significantly showed poorest survival for distal aortic arch entry tear site group. The location of the primary entry tear in patients with Stanford A AAD significantly influences early outcomes, short- and long-term survival of patients, whereas survival of patients free from major cerebrovascular events showed similar results among the three groups.

    "abstract": "Cold agglutinin disease is characterized by acrocyanosis, hemolytic anemia, and occasionally, frank hemoglobinuria. Although cold agglutinins are commonly detected, they are rarely clinically significant due to subphysiologic temperatures at which agglutination occurs. Cardiovascular surgical procedures requiring hypothermia present a unique challenge for these patients, requiring modification of the conduct of cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegia. Herein we report a case of a patient with a prior history of symptomatic cold agglutinin disease and type A aortic dissection, presenting with dilation of his known diseased ascending aorta, requiring semi-urgent repair. The patient underwent plasma exchange on two successive days preceding surgery to reduce the cold agglutinin titre. A modified Bentall procedure and replacement of ascending aorta and hemiarch under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest was performed without complication. This case demonstrates the efficacy of employing plasma exchange in preparation for cardiac surgery with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest in a patient with clinically significant cold agglutinin disease. Plasma exchange alone may be sufficient in preparing patients with cold agglutinin disease for procedures requiring significant hypothermia when the delayed onset of action of alternative therapies is not acceptable. Choice of replacement fluid is critical in ensuring maintenance of coagulation proteins perioperatively and minimizing complement activation."

Cardiac tamponade caused by ascending aorta rupture is the most common cause of death. In light of this, emergent surgery with ascending and partial arch replacement represents, in most of cases, the best and the faster therapeutic option. The natural history of aortic dissection, however, teaches us that in most cases there is a distal progression of the aortic disease that often requires further surgical and/or endovascular treatments. In light of this, it can be hypothesized that, by increasing the extent of aortic replacement during the first operation, it may improve the outcome of these patients by reducing the probability of a second surgery or, in selected cases and for appropriate indications, by treating with a single surgical step, the disease. In this short review of the literature, we focalized on the rationale and outcome of an extensive repair of the thoracic aorta."

A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data over a 6-year period (2011-2016) was performed on a consecutive series of 53 adult patients who underwent emergency cardiac surgery for AAAD in the Buenos Aires University Hospital in Argentina. A mean of 8.8 AAAD repairs were performed yearly during the 6-year period. In-hospital mortality was 17%, and was statistically equivalent to the expected operative mortality rate of 21% (EuroSCORE II) (observed-to-expected mortality ratio 0.81; p=0.620). New neurological deficit appeared postoperatively in 6% of cases, and the observed major postoperative morbidity rate was 42%. All-cause death cumulative survival probability was 0.711 (SE 0.074), with a mean follow-up period of 49.2 (SE 5.0) months. Cumulative survival probability for in-hospital survivors was 0.903 (SE 0.053), with a mean follow-up period of 62.5 (SE 3.6) months. Although the present results do not reach international standards, AAAD surgery in our institution was associated with an acceptable mortality risk and satisfactory mid-term survival compared with previous local studies. In addition to in-hospital mortality, the incidence of new permanent neurological deficit after surgery must be considered the most devastating complication to avoid. Patient-focused care in referral aortic centers with surgery performed by specialized teams should be encouraged in order to improve surgical outcomes in acute aortic dissection surgery in Argentina."

Additionally, MDCT may also reveal clues towards an alternative diagnosis that was not even suspected on the basis of a history and physical examination. Consequently, it is indispensable for radiologists to be able to accurately and efficiently recognize imaging features of disorders that may present as an acute abdomen. While gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary and genitourinary causes account for most cases of acute abdomen, vascular etiologies may also be implicated in a small-but significant-proportion of cases. Therefore, in this pictorial review, we describe the typical MDCT imaging features of various vascular etiologies that may present as an acute abdomen."

Between 2011 and 2016, 234 AAD patients were selected. Recurrent pain was defined as a mean of VAS > 3, within 48 hours following hospital admission or before emergency operation. Patients with and without recurrent pain were divided into group I and group II, respectively into type A AAD and type B AAD patients. Our primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The incidence of recurrent pain was 24.4 % in AAD patients. Incidence of recurrent pain was higher in type A AAD patients than type B AAD patients (48.9 vs. 9.6 %). Overall in-hospital mortality was 25.6 %. Type A AAD had a higher in-hospital mortality than type B AAD patients (47.7 vs. 12.3 %). Group I had significantly higher in-hospital mortality than group II (type A: 79.1 vs. 17.8 %; type B: 57.1 vs. 7.6 %, all P < 0.001), as was the case with medical managed patients (type A: 72.1 vs. 13.3 %; type B: 35.7 vs. 2.3 %, all P < 0.001).

    "abstract": "The feasibility of medical management for select patients with acute type A aortic dissection has been reported from a few institutions. In this study, we retrospectively investigated the safety and feasibility of our conservative approach for patients with type A aortic dissection in daily practice. From January 2013 to December 2017, 131 consecutive patients were admitted to our institution for acute aortic dissection, including 58 patients of type A. Initial medical management was attempted in select patients who were clinically stable and had a thrombosed false lumen of the ascending aorta without ulcer-like projections in the ascending aorta. Except for nine patients contraindicated for surgery, urgent surgery was performed in 26 patients (SRG group), while 23 patients (MED group) were treated with the initial medical management. The maximum diameter of the ascending aorta was significantly larger in the SRG group than in the MED group. In the MED group, the heart rate and blood pressures were well-controlled at admission to the intensive-care unit, and the systolic blood pressure was further reduced at 24 h after. The in-hospital mortality rates of the MED and SRG groups were 0% and 15%, respectively. During the follow-up period, the survival rate was significantly higher in the MED group than in the SRG group, and the aortic event-free survival at one year was 80%. The initial medical management for select patients with a thrombosed false lumen in the ascending aorta was a safe and feasible strategy in real-world practice."

    "title": "Multiple Re-entry Closures After TEVAR for Ruptured Chronic Post-dissection Thoraco-abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.",
    "abstract": "Although thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has become a promising treatment for complicated acute type B dissection, its role in treating chronic post-dissection thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm (TAA) is still limited owing to persistent retrograde flow into the false lumen (FL) through abdominal or iliac re-entry tears. A case of chronic post-dissection TAA treatment, in which a dilated descending FL ruptured into the left thorax, is described. The primary entry tear was closed by emergency TEVAR and multiple abdominal re-entries were closed by EVAR. In addition, major re-entries at the detached right renal artery and iliac bifurcation were closed using covered stents. To close re-entries as far as possible, EVAR was carried out using the chimney technique, and additional aortic extenders were placed above the coeliac artery. A few re-entries remained, but complete FL thrombosis of the rupture site was achieved. Follow-up computed tomography showed significant shrinkage of the FL. In treating post-dissection TAA, entry closure by TEVAR is sometimes insufficient, owing to persistent retrograde flow into the FL from abdominal or iliac re-entries. Adjunctive techniques are needed to close these distal re-entries to obtain complete FL exclusion, especially in rupture cases. Recently, encouraging results of complete coverage of the thoraco-abdominal aorta with fenestrated or branched endografts have been reported; however, the widespread employment of such techniques appears to be limited owing to technical difficulties. The present method with multiple re-entry closures using off the shelf and immediately available devices is an alternative for the endovascular treatment of post-dissection TAA, especially in the emergency setting."

    "title": "Intimal re-layering technique for type A acute aortic dissection-reconstructing the intimal layer continuity to induce remodeling of the false channel.",
    "abstract": "Residual false channel is common after repair of type A acute aortic dissection (TAAAD). Starting from our recent series of TAAAD patients we carried out a retrospective analysis, regarding the failure of primary exclusion at the time of the initial operation. We classified the location of the principal entry tears perfusing the residual false channel. The proposed technique represents our attempt to correct the mechanism of false channel perfusion during primary repair. We describe a new technique designed to address some limitations of standard hemiarch aortic replacement. Its goal are: (I) to reinforce the intimal layer at the arch level; (II) to eliminate inter-luminal communications at the arch level using suture lines around the arch vessels; (III) to provide an elephant trunk configuration for further interventions. Between August 2016 and January 2018, 11 patients underwent emergency surgery using this technique; 7 were men; the median age was 74 years. All patients were treated using systemic circulatory arrest under moderate hypothermia (26 °C) and selective cerebral perfusion. All patients had supra-coronary repair; 1 patient had aortic valve replacement + CABG. In the first two patients a manual suture around supra-aortic trunks was used; the subsequent seven patients were treated with a mechanical suture bladeless device. CT scan follow up was performed in all survivors with controls before discharge 3 months and 1 year after operation. No patient died in the operating room and no neurologic deficit was observed in this initial experience. One patient died in POD 5th for low cardiac output syndrome. Median ICU stay was 3 days (IQR, 2-6 days). Hospital mean length of stay was 15.2±8 days. Median cardiopulmonary bypass time was 130 min (IQR, 110-141 min); median arrest time for re-layering was 17 min (IQR, 16-20 min); median total arrest was 36 min (IQR, 29-39 min). Distal aortic anastomosis was performed in zone 0 in 4 patients, zone 1, with innominate replacement, in 5 patients, in zone 2, with branches to innominate and left common carotid arteries, in 2 patients. Median follow up (closing date 06/01/2018) was 443 days (IQR, 262-557 days); no late deaths occurred. No dehiscence at the level of stapler or manual sutures was observed. Proximal 1/3 of the thoracic aorta false channel was obliterated in all cases but one; in 3 cases complete exclusion of the false channel was obtained after operation. In one case stent graft completion was required. This technique combines the advantages of arch replacement to the simplicity of anterior hemiarch repair. This study demonstrates the safety of the procedure and the possibility to induce aortic remodeling without complex arch replacement."

    "abstract": "Stanford type B aortic dissection is one of the aortic catastrophes with a high mortality and morbidity that needs immediate or delayed treatment, either surgically or endovascularly. This comprehensive review article addresses the current status of open, endovascular and hybrid treatment options for type B aortic dissections with the focus on new therapeutic perspectives. Evaluation of currently available evidence based on randomized and registry data and personal experience. All type B dissections require prompt medical treatment to prevent aortic rupture. Acute complicated dissections are nowadays treated by endografting to reroute blood flow into the true lumen and promote false lumen thrombosis and future aortic remodeling. In acute uncomplicated situations the position of endografting is less clear and should be further delineated; however, on the long run also in these situations endografting might be protective for future aortic catastrophes in certain patient categories. In the chronic dissection with aneurysm formation of the descending thoracic and/or thoracoabdominal aorta, especially in connective tissue disorders, open surgery offers nowadays the best immediate results with long durability. Thoracic endografting plays only a minor role in these circumstances but branched and fenestrated endografting are very promising techniques. Hybrid techniques can offer the solution for high risk patients that are not suitable for open surgery. Emergent thoracic endografting is the golden standard for all complicated type B dissections while uncomplicated patients with high-risk features might benefit from endovascular repair. Open surgery is limited for chronic post dissection aneurysms. Aortic surveillance is of paramount importance in all situations."

    "abstract": "To explore the association of weather conditions and air pollutants with incidence risk of acute aortic dissection (AAD), we included patients who consecutively admitted to the emergency units of our hospital for AAD between Dec. 1, 2013, and Apr. 30, 2017. Their medical records were reviewed. The meteorological data (daily precipitation, minimal and maximal temperatures, mean atmospheric pressure, relative humidity) and air pollutants values [air daily index (AQI), aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 mm or less (PM2.5), aerodynamic diameter of 10 mm or less (PM10), ozone, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ozone (O3_8h)] over the same period were provided by the Chengdu Meteorological Bureau. Finally, a total of 345 patients were admitted with AAD. The results showed that the incidence of AAD was higher in winter than in summer (p < 0.001). Statistical analysis highlighted lower the atmospheric temperature, higher the incidence of AAD (p < 0.001). A significant correlation was found between air pollutants and AAD onset. AQI, PM2.5, SO2, and NO2 were independent predictors of incidence of AAD (OR = 1.006, p = 0.007; OR = 1.020, p < 0.001; OR = 1.037, p < 0.001; and OR = 0.925, p < 0.001; respectively). While, PM10, CO, and O3_8H had a neutral effect on risk of AAD onset. In conclusions, cold atmospheric temperature and larger daily temperature change were correlated with a higher incidence of AAD. AQI, PM2.5, and SO2 played important roles in triggering acute aortic events."

    "abstract": "The lack of an antidote against factor Xa inhibitors in case of major bleeding or need for urgent surgery is a concern to clinicians. Guidelines on managing major bleeding in patients under anticoagulation with a factor Xa inhibitor suggest several hemostatic agents to reverse the effect, but there is no consensus regarding the choice of drug or appropriate dose. The ability of prothrombin complex concentrate, activated prothrombin complex concentrate, and recombinant factor VIIa to reverse the effect of factor Xa inhibitors has been evaluated in animal studies, in vitro studies, and healthy volunteers, but not yet in randomized clinical studies. We report a consecutive case series of patients under factor Xa inhibitor (apixaban) treatment who received activated prothrombin complex concentrate to reverse the anticoagulation effect before emergency cardiovascular surgery. Patient 1, a 63-year-old white man, was operated with replacement of the aortic valve; patient 2, a 65-year-old white man, underwent heart transplantation; patient 3, a 68-year-old white man, was operated for acute type A aortic dissection. They all received activated prothrombin complex concentrate 25 IU/kg immediately before surgery. In two of the cases, the global coagulation assay thromboelastometry (ROTEM™) was performed before and after administering activated prothrombin complex concentrate. The ROTEM™ clotting time was reduced from 1900 seconds to 740 seconds and from 1482 to 807 seconds, respectively, after administering a dose of 25 IU/kg activated prothrombin complex concentrate. The apixaban concentration before reversal was within the range considered to be the therapeutic level in all cases. No bleeding complications occurred during surgery, but one case was complicated with bleeding postoperatively. No thromboembolic complications were observed during or after surgery. Activated prothrombin complex concentrate 25 IU/kg reversed the anticoagulation effect of apixaban effectively and safely before emergency cardiovascular surgery."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection is a potentially catastrophic cardiovascular emergency that is associated with a high mortality rate. Pregnancy, with its attendant hormonal and physiological changes, increases the risk of dissection in women with known thoracic aortic aneurysms. In this review, we highlight the importance of preconception counseling to help women with known thoracic aortic aneurysms better understand their risk of dissection and the heritable nature of thoracic aortic disease and its associated syndromes. The risk of aortic dissection during pregnancy differs according to the underlying etiology of thoracic aortic aneurysm and the degree of aortic dilatation at baseline. Guideline-specific management of women with thoracic aortic aneurysms in pregnancy reduces their risk of dissection. Management of pregnant women with thoracic aortic aneurysms requires an intensive multidisciplinary approach to maximize the chances of a successful outcome for both the mother and fetus. Preconception counseling provides an opportunity to optimize patients medically and to consider potential prophylactic aortic repair prior to pregnancy."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection is a cardiovascular emergency with high mortality that necessitates prompt diagnosis and immediate treatment. Though asymmetric extremity pulses/blood pressures and mediastinal widening on chest roentgenogram are often clues to diagnosis, aortic regurgitation (AR) of variable degrees could be the only sign on initial assessment. Mostly resulting from dilated aortic ring with valvular insufficiency, the AR could be caused by different pathogenic mechanisms. Herein we report a case of Stanford type A aortic dissection presenting with acute pulmonary edema. Physical examination detected severe AR murmur and bedside echocardiogram confirmed prolapsed dissecting intima flap with interference of aortic valve closure as a specific mechanism. A 36-year-old man presented with rapidly progressive dyspnea within hours. Physical examination disclosed a grade IV/VI diastolic murmur at aortic area and left parasternal border. Immediate bedside echocardiography revealed an onion-shaped aortic root with a dissecting intima flapping to-and-fro in between aortic root and left ventricular outflow tract, thus interfering with aortic valve closure and resulting in severe AR. Chest computed tomography confirmed a Stanford type A aortic dissection with the dilated aortic root well hidden in cardiac silhouette, making chest roentgenogram difficult for diagnosis. Emergency operation with Bentall procedure was performed smoothly and the patient was discharged uneventfully later. Acute pulmonary edema resulting from severe AR is a specific presentation of aortic dissection. New-onset AR murmur, either caused by aortic ring dilatation or prolapsed intima flap interfering with aortic valve closure, may serve as a clue to timely correct diagnosis."

Also known as pulseless disease, occlusive thromboaortopathy, and Martorell syndrome, is a chronic inflammatory aortitis. Vessel inflammation leads to wall thickening, fibrosis, stenosis, and thrombus formation. A 64-year-old woman was referred to emergency for lack of pulse in the upper and lower limbs and changes in heart rate. AngioRMN revealed dissection of the ascending aorta while in PET, intense uptake of FDG-F18 involving ascending, crossa, descending thoracic and abdominal segments of the aorta, was evident urgent surgical correction occurred. An aorta ring segment with 2.5cm length, showed whitish and smooth intimate, with linear transversal laceration, with regular borders. Dissection 1cm long of the medial tunica was occupied by a clot in continuity with a thrombus occupying the neoformed lumen. Microscopy examination confirmed hyalinization of the tunica media with impregnation of fibrin / thrombus with blood cell elements. Endothelial inflammatory characteristics together with vasa vasorum and vascular trajectory of the periphery of the tunica media with inflammatory cells involvement allowed the diagnosis of Takayasu aortitis. Takayasu aortitis is rare in the presented age group, with early non-specific symptoms. The diagnosis of aortic dissection was crucial, constituting a medical emergency. Heather L-Gomik (2008) supports the hyaline structural alteration of the tunica media. The disease has been recognized for more than 100 years, and patients with Takayasu aortitis remain relatively poor and treatment is suboptimal. Key areas for improvement include the need for increase disease awareness and earlier diagnosis, and improved means for monitoring disease activity. The demonstration of diferential expression of Toll-like receptors in arteries, is particularly intriguing and worthy of further investigation."

    "abstract": "Spinal cord ischemia (SCI) is a feared complication after endovascular correction of thoracic aortic diseases (TEVAR). The guidelines of the European Society for Vascular Surgery recommend prophylactic lumbar drainage (LD) of cerebrospinal fluid in high-risk patients undergoing TEVAR. Our institutional protocol considers as high-risk patients as: coverage of the origin of the Adamkiewicz artery (T9-T12), aortic coverage >15 cm, involvement of collaterals (treated or untreated abdominal aortic aneurysm, left subclavian artery revascularization or bilateral occlusion of the internal iliac arteries) and symptomatic SCI. The objective of the study was to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of LD in preventing or treating SCI after TEVAR. Patients submitted to LD in the perioperative period of TEVAR under the institutional protocol, between May 2015 and April 2017, were prospectively included. prevention and/or reversal of neurological symptoms (efficacy). Secondary Outcome: complications related to the technique (safety). We included 8 patients with thoracoabdominal aneurysms and 1 patient with type B aortic dissection, aged 63- 75 years. Eight interventions were elective and one was urgent. The LD catheter was placed before surgery in 8 cases and in the postoperative period in 1 case due to symptomatology of SCI that reverted after liquor drainage. Of those placed pre-operatively, 2 had symptoms of SCI in the postoperative period, which alleviated with increased drainage and hemodynamic and hemoglobin optimization. The patient undergoing urgent TEVAR for ruptured thoracoabdominal aneurysm evolved with multiorgan dysfunction and death 24 hours after surgery. There were no other complications. In this initial experience, the institutional protocol with LD placement proved to be safe and effective in preventing and treating SCI after TEVAR."

    "abstract": "The objective of this retrospective project was to assess the frequency with which patients presenting to an emergency department had used the descriptive terms \"ripping\" and \"tearing\" to describe their symptoms from later-confirmed acute thoracic aortic dissection. The authors conducted a retrospective chart review from 58 patients who had presented to two suburban and urban emergency departments with suspected acute thoracic dissection between 1997 and 2015. They reviewed charts for patients' pain descriptors in ambulance personnel records and initial notes and dictations from ED triage nurses, staff nurses, and physicians. These pieces of documentation would have been made before the diagnosis of acute thoracic aortic dissection could been confirmed. The authors identified a sample subset of 29 (50% of total charts pulled) patients later confirmed to have had an acute thoracic aorta dissection. They found that no sample patients used either the descriptors \"ripping\" or \"tearing\" when communicating their presenting symptoms. In this paper, the authors will provide several alternative terms patients have been shown to offer for this life-threatening condition. Although the terms \"ripping\" and \"tearing\" have historically been associated with acute thoracic aortic dissections, these project results indicate that clinicians may consider other descriptive symptomatic terms from patients when evaluating patients' symptoms for this potential life-threatening condition."

Laboratory tests showed marked elevation of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) demonstrated Type A aortic dissection with a thrombosed false lumen in the ascending aorta. The primary entry tear was located 2 cm distal to the left subclavian artery. Malperfusion of bilateral renal arteries was also evident due to compression by the false lumen. Considering her poor preoperative condition, thoracic endovascular repair of the entry was performed. The primary entry tear was covered using a covered Zenith TX-D stent graft, and a supplemental non-covered Zenith TX-D stent was deployed from the distal edge of the stent graft to the infrarenal aorta. After 5 days of dialysis and additional renal angioplasty for the stenotic left renal artery, her renal function recovered to normal. Her postoperative course was uneventful. Enhanced CT 1 month after surgery showed obliteration of the false lumen of the ascending aorta and patent renal arteries bilaterally."

    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic dissection (TAD) is a serious condition requiring urgent treatment to avoid catastrophic consequences. The inflammatory response is involved in the occurrence and development of TAD, possibly potentiated by platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs). This study aimed to determine whether expression of PDGF-B (a subunit of PDGF-BB) was increased in TAD patients and to explore the factors responsible for its upregulation and subsequent effects on TAD. Full-thickness ascending aorta wall specimens from TAD patients (n = 15) and control patients (n = 10) were examined for expression of PDGF-B and its receptor (PDGFRB) and in terms of morphology, inflammation, and fibrosis. Blood samples from TAD and control patients were collected to detect plasma levels of PDGF-BB and soluble elastins. Expression levels of PDGF-B, PDGFRB, and collagen I were significantly enhanced in ascending aorta wall specimens from TAD patients compared with controls. Furthermore, soluble elastic fragments and PDGF-BB were significantly increased in plasma from TAD patients compared with controls, and numerous irregular elastic fibers and macrophages were seen in the ascending aorta wall in TAD patients. An increase in elastic fragments in the aorta wall might be responsible for inducing the activation and migration of macrophages to injured sites, leading to elevated expression of PDGF-B, which in turn induces deposition of collagen, disrupts extracellular matrix homeostasis, and increases the stiffness of the aorta wall, resulting in compromised aorta compliance."

Data were obtained for 24 patients with AIS or TIA with AAD (15 women; mean age, 75 ± 12 years) and 812 patients without AAD (305 women; mean age, 73 ± 12 years). Compared with patients without AAD, patients with AAD displayed significantly higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) laterality (30 ± 20 mm Hg versus 12 ± 11 mm Hg), initial D-dimer concentration (median 38.1 µg/mL versus 1.3 µg/mL), and mediastinal width-to-chest width (M/C) ratio on x-ray (.35 ± .05 versus .29 ± .05), and more frequently showed common carotid artery (CCA) dissection on carotid ultrasonography (84% versus 1%) and pericardial effusion on echocardiography (43% versus 0%). Sensitivity and specificity to identify AAD were 80% and 75% for SBP laterality 17 mm Hg or greater; 100% and 86% for D-dimer concentration 4.1 µg/mL or greater; 75% and 76% for M/C ratio .32 or greater; 84% and 99% for CCA dissection; and 43% and 100% for pericardial effusion, respectively. High D-dimer level may provide the most reliable screening test for AAD in patients with AIS or TIA. CCA dissection on ultrasonography appears to represent the most disease-specific finding and shows acceptable sensitivity."

In elderly patients, surgery for AAD carries considerable morbidity and mortality. Repair of AAD after previous TEVAR is an even greater challenge as it usually requires the arch to be addressed and a preexisting stent graft to be included into the aortic repair. A case series of 5 elderly patients who presented with acute AAD after previous TEVAR was reviewed. In 4 cases, there was retrograde AAD with involvement of the arch and stent graft. In 1 patient, intraoperative inspection showed no involvement of the arch. Three underwent ascending and subtotal arch replacement in moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest with selective cerebral perfusion. In 1 case, concomitant tricuspid valve repair was performed. The patient without involvement of the arch underwent emergent replacement of the ascending aorta in deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, and in the oldest, aged 88 years, surgery was limited to wrapping of the ascending aorta as an on-pump beating salvage procedure. Four (80%) of 5 patients survived and were discharged after an intensive care unit stay of 17.45 ± 15.98 days and a hospital stay of 26.0 ± 10.98 days. Mortality was 20%.

The aim of this study was to evaluate early outcomes and long-term survival of hypertensive patients in comparison to normotensive patients suffering from Stanford A AAD. In our center, 240 patients with Stanford A AAD underwent aortic surgical repair from January 2006 to April 2015. After statistical and logistic regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival estimation was performed, with up to 9-year follow-up. The proportion of hypertensive patients suffering from Stanford A AAD was 75.4% (n=181). There were only few statistically significant differences in terms of basic demographics, comorbidities, preoperative baseline and clinical characteristics of hypertensive patients in comparison to normotensive patients. Hypertensive patients were significantly older (p=0.008), more frequently received hemi-arch repair (p=0.028) and selective brain perfusion (p=0.001). Our study showed similar statistical results in terms of 30-day mortality (p=0.196), long-term overall cumulative survival of patients (Log-Rank p=0.506) and survival of patients free from cerebrovascular events (Log-Rank p=0.186). Furthermore, subgroup analysis for long-term survival in terms of men (Log-Rank p=0.853), women (Log-Rank p=0.227), patients under and above 65 years of age (Log-Rank p=0.188 and Log-Rank p=0.602, respectively) and patients undergoing one of the three types of aortic repair surgery showed similar results for normotensive and hypertensive patient groups. Subgroup analysis for long-term survival of patients free from cerebrovascular events for women, patients under 65 years of age and patients undergoing aortic arch repair showed significant differences between the two groups in favor of hypertensive patients. Hypertensive patients suffering from Stanford A AAD were older, more frequently received hemi-arch replacement and were not associated with increased risk of 30-day mortality and poorer long-term survival compared to normotensive patients."

    "abstract": "Stanford type A aortic dissection (AAD) sometimes causes acute ischemic stroke (AIS) or transient ischemic attack (TIA). There is little understanding of cerebrovascular imaging of AIS or TIA in patients with AAD. Consecutive AIS/TIA patients with AAD who were admitted within 4.5 h of onset were reviewed. We compared findings of MRI/MRA between these and consecutive AIS/TIA patients without AAD within 4.5 h of onset. Seventeen AAD and 249 non-AAD patients were identified. Compared to non-AAD patients, AAD patients had infarcts more frequently in the right anterior cerebral artery (ACA) territory (18% vs. 2%, P = 0.007) and the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory (71% vs. 29%, P < 0.001). There was no difference between the groups regarding whether it was perforator or cortical infarct, single or multiple infarcts, unilateral or bilateral infarcts, or ischemic change extension. On the MRA imaging, the AAD patients more frequently had poor visualization of the right internal carotid artery (ICA) (47% vs. 6%, P < 0.001). After adjustment for sex, age and confounding factors, the right ACA territory infarct [odds ratio (OR), 12.2; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.4-119.4], the MCA territory infarct (OR, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.0-25.0) and poor visualization of the right ICA (OR, 18.1; 95% CI, 4.0-101.9) were independently associated with AAD. In emergency AIS/TIA patients, right anterior circulation infarct and poor visualization of the right ICA on cerebrovascular imaging are potential imaging markers of AAD."

    "title": "Thoracoabdominal aortic replacement in patients aged 50 and younger.",
    "abstract": "Open repair of a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) has been regarded as one of the most invasive procedures in cardiovascular surgery. Conversely, endovascular technology currently enables the repair of the thoracoabdominal aorta, and this approach is less invasive. However, the long-term durability of this method of endovascular repair remains unknown. This investigation retrospectively analyzed the long-term durability of thoracoabdominal aorta repair in patients aged 50 and younger. Since 1995, 100 patients aged 50 and younger underwent thoracoabdominal aortic replacement at our institution. There were 63 males, and the average age was 38 ± 7. Ninety-six had aortic dissection as an aortic pathology. Marfan syndrome was found in 61 patients, Loeys-Dietz in 10, Acta 2 mutations in 4, aortitis in 2, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in 1. There were 2 patients with a type I TAAA, 56 with a type II, 33 with a type III, and 9 with a type IV. There were 3 hospital deaths (3%), of which 2 were emergent cases. Spinal cord injury occurred in 1 patient (1%). Two patients (2%) had wound complications. Three patients suffered cerebral hemorrhage and 1 had an intramedullary infection, of which all were associated with cerebrospinal fluid drainage. The 3-year survival rate after the operation was 94%, that of 5 years was 94%, and that of 10 years was 91%. Results of thoracoabdominal aortic replacement in patients aged 50 and younger were favorable. While spinal cord complications were rare, cerebrospinal drainage revealed several complications in this series. Evolving endovascular repair needs to be compared with these results, especially in patients aged 50 and younger."

    "abstract": "Aggressive total arch replacement (TAR) to obtain thrombosis of the distal false lumen (FL) in patients with Stanford Type A acute aortic dissection, particularly with a patent FL at the descending aorta, is discussed. The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of our strategy. In the last 20 years, we retrospectively reviewed the records of 518 patients with Type A acute aortic dissection who underwent an emergent surgery. Among them, 290 patients with a preoperative patent FL at the descending aorta were enrolled in this study. Patients were divided in 2 groups: the non-TAR group (n = 124; 68 ± 14 years) and the TAR group (n = 166; 61 ± 13 years). In-hospital mortality was 11% (32/290) without significant difference between the 2 groups (the non-TAR group 13% vs the TAR group 10%, P = 0.45). The rates of FL thrombosis of the entire descending aorta were detected at 32% in the non-TAR group and 41% in the TAR group (P = 0.16). Freedom from distal aortic dilatation ≥50 mm was significantly higher in the TAR group (P = 0.03) than in the non-TAR group. Independent predictors of distal aortic dilatation >50 mm were patients in the non-TAR group (P = 0.01; hazard ratio 3.1, 95% confidence interval 1.28-8.05) and unachieved primary entry tear resection (P = 0.002; hazard ratio 6.2, 95% confidence interval 1.38-8.66). Our surgical strategy with an aggressive entry resection with higher rate of TAR was acceptable. In patients with a patent FL at the descending aorta, TAR should be considered to prevent the future growth of the distal aorta."

We studied 120 consecutive patients with AAD type I admitted for emergency surgery (group I), 121 consecutive patients with aortic aneurysms of the ascending aorta prior to elective repair (group II) and 121 controls (group III), age and sex matched. PLR was significantly higher in group I vs both groups II and III (P < .001). There was an excellent correlation of PLR with neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in all three groups (P < .001 for all). After adjustment for hemoglobin, RDW did not differ but RPR remained significantly higher in group I compared to groups II and III (P < .001). The best cutoff value of PLR to predict dissection was 159 with 53% sensitivity and 86% specificity. No association between PLR, RDW, and RPR and mortality in group I was found. Indices derived from full cell blood count may provide diagnostic information in patients with AAD; whether these indices may contribute to prognosis assessment should be further investigated."

Several reports have shown that the mediastinal widening on a chest radiograph is useful for the diagnosis of nontraumatic Stanford type A acute aortic dissection; however, the exact cutoff value of the mediastinal width on plain radiographs is rarely defined. A single-center retrospective case-control study was conducted between October 1, 2013, and March 31, 2015. We evaluated the maximal mediastinal width of the anteroposterior chest X-ray at the level of the aortic knob in the supine position between patient groups with and without nontraumatic Stanford type A acute aortic dissection. We enrolled 72 patients (36 patients with nontraumatic Stanford type A acute aortic dissection and 36 patients without nontraumatic Stanford type A acute aortic dissection). The median mediastinal width of patients with nontraumatic Stanford type A acute aortic dissection was significantly larger than that of patients without nontraumatic Stanford type A acute aortic dissection (100.7 mm vs 77.7 mm, P < .01). The optimal cutoff level was 87 mm (sensitivity, 81%; specificity, 89%). Using multivariable logistic regression, the odds ratio of a mediastinal width of >87 mm for a diagnosis nontraumatic Stanford type A acute aortic dissection was 57.1 (95% confidence interval, 11.2-290.2). A mediastinal width of >87 mm showed high sensitivity in the diagnosis of probable nontraumatic Stanford type A acute aortic dissection."

Despite medical treatment and malperfusion of lower extremities, acute renal failure developed; hence thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) was considered under general anaesthesia. After endotracheal intubation, ventilation with low tidal volume required high inspiratory airway pressure. An arterial blood gas analysis showed PaCO2 of 61.8mmHg and PaO2 of 26.4mmHg, indicating a status asthmaticus of hypoxaemia and hypercarbia, which did not respond to bronchodilator or mechanical ventilation. Impending cardiac arrest was treated using venovenous extracorporeal life support, which was administered by percutaneous femoral cannulation. Surgical procedure was completed without any complications. Extracorporeal life support was weaned at one day after the operation. The patient was discharged without any complications."

A large amount of bleeding was seen in the pericardium, but aortic dissection around the arch was not observed. Instead, a ruptured aneurysm of a coronary-pulmonary fistula was identified on the pulmonary artery root. The aneurysm was resected, and the fistula was closed by ligation. The patient's postoperative progress was good, and he was discharged on postoperative day 12 without any abnormalities on the coronary arteriogram. Preoperative diagnosis of the rupture of the small coronary artery aneurysm is difficult in such an emergency case, and this possibility should be considered in differential diagnosis when the CT image does not show typical aortic dissection."

The aim of this study was to investigate thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) outcomes in patients with confirmed or suspected syndromic and nonsyndromic genetically triggered thoracic aortic dissection. We analyzed data for patients with descending thoracic aorta (DTA) dissection treated with TEVAR from the National Registry of Genetically Triggered Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms and Cardiovascular Conditions (GenTAC). Enrolled patients had confirmed (syndromic or familial) or suspected genetically triggered thoracic aortic disease. The latter group includes patients with sporadic aortic dissection presenting at 50 years of age or younger in the absence of a family history or syndromic features. Between 2006 and 2014, there were 371 patients with DTA dissection enrolled in GenTAC. TEVAR was performed in 31 cases (58.1% male; median age, 47 years; range, 21.3-65.6 years). Genetically triggered aortic dissection was confirmed in 18 cases, and an additional 13 cases had suspected genetically triggered dissection because of early onset of presentation. TEVAR was performed in nine patients with type A aortic dissection: five in conjunction with acute type A dissection repair and four in the chronic phase to treat aneurysmal degeneration of the residual dissected DTA (median interval to TEVAR, 2.1 years). TEVAR was also performed in 22 cases of type B aortic dissection (TBAD), 12 acute and 10 chronic (median interval to TEVAR, 1.6 years). There were no perioperative deaths. Median follow-up for all cases was 2 years (range, 0.4 month-7 years). Reinterventions after TEVAR were performed in 13 cases (41.9%). This included urgent repair of three retrograde ascending aorta dissections occurring after TEVAR for acute TBAD (25%) and seven thoracoabdominal repairs with stent graft explantation (22.6%) at a median of 7 months after TEVAR (range, 1-16.6 months). TEVAR in patients with genetically triggered aortic dissections can be lifesaving in the acute setting though associated with high risk of retrograde aortic dissection in acute TBAD. For chronic dissection-related DTA aneurysmal degeneration, TEVAR could potentially be lifesaving in patients deemed too high risk for open surgical repair. Close postoperative surveillance is required, given the risk of subsequent device failure and need for reintervention. Because these circumstances are rare, multicenter prospective enrollment of patients with genetically triggered aortic disease is essential to delineate the indications for and risks of TEVAR in this heterogeneous population."

We reviewed patients with SCI in acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) and acute type B aortic dissection (ATBAD) from September 1999 to May 2014. SCI was defined as paraplegia or paraparesis present on admission. Monoparesis/plegia, paraesthesia, or numbness was defined as ischemic neuropathy. All ATBAD patients were managed with antiimpulse therapy, with selective intervention for rupture, rapid aortic expansion, malperfusion, or intractable pain. ATAAD patients were managed with urgent proximal aortic replacement. Neurologic symptoms were present in 178 (18.2%) of 978 acute dissections (482 ATAAD and 496 ATBAD). Of these 178 patients, SCI presented in 52 patients (29.2%; 80.1% male; mean age, 57 years). On admission paraplegia was present in 24 (46.2%), paraparesis in 10 (19.2%), paresthesia/numbness in 27 (51.9%), and leg ischemia in 25 (48.1%). Aortic operations were performed in 27 SCI patients (51.9%). Symptom resolution was seen in 30 (57.7%). The 30-day mortality was 19.2% and was significantly less in those with resolution of SCI (6.7% vs 36.4%, p = 0.012). When surgical intervention was required in ATBAD with SCI, mortality was 50% (p = 0.039). SCI and symptom resolution significantly affected overall survival. SCI is associated with significantly increased risk of overall mortality (hazard ratio, 2.9; p < 0.001), and SCI resolution completely offsets this risk (hazard ratio, 0.28; p = 0.003). These effects were consistent between ATAAD and ATBAD (p = 0.554). SCI in acute aortic dissection portends a poor prognosis. However, reversal of deficits is associated with a long-term survival outcome comparable to patients unaffected with SCI."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) classically manifests with sudden, severe chest pain radiating to the back or abdomen, often described as ripping or tearing sensation. Considering its abrupt onset, the diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion prompting immediate imaging using computed tomography (CT) with contrast. However, the use of contrast is a relative contraindication in the patients with renal compromise and acute care physicians are often deterred from contrast use in these patients. Herein, we present an unusual case of hematuria as the presenting symptom of a developing the Stanford type-A AAD. A 65-year-old female presented with sudden, severe chest pain radiating to her lower back. She reported that her urine color was 'pink' on the previous day and was becoming more 'red-colored' as the day progressed. The next morning, she began feeling a 10/10 crushing-type chest pain that was relieved when she lay on her left side and was associated with nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis. The urine analysis revealed gross hematuria. The laboratory findings revealed a creatinine of 1.3. Due to her elevated creatine levels and possible acute kidney injury, a computed tomography (CT) without contrast was performed initially, which did not reveal an AAD. However, the index of suspicion was still high for the AAD, after prompt discussions about the risk of using contrast and contrast nephropathy versus the risks of potential complications, if AAD was missed. Further evaluation with CT of the chest and abdomen, with contrast, was obtained with the patients' consent, which revealed a Stanford type-A AAD starting proximally from the aortic arch and extending to the common iliac. In conclusion, the clinical presentations of AAD are more heterogeneous. Hematuria in the presence of high index of suspicion and symptoms of AAD could indicate the extension of the involvement of the renal arteries. Prompt CT with contrast may be indicated despite relative contraindications from the laboratory findings."

Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios for a first diagnosis of aortic aneurysm or dissection, defined as admission to hospital or emergency department for, or death due to, aortic aneurysm or dissection, within 60 days from start of treatment. Within the 60 day risk period, the rate of aortic aneurysm or dissection was 1.2 cases per 1000 person years among fluoroquinolone users and 0.7 cases per 1000 person years among amoxicillin users. Fluoroquinolone use was associated with an increased risk of aortic aneurysm or dissection (hazard ratio 1.66 (95% confidence interval 1.12 to 2.46)), with an estimated absolute difference of 82 (95% confidence interval 15 to 181) cases of aortic aneurysm or dissection by 60 days per 1 million treatment episodes. In a secondary analysis, the hazard ratio for the association with fluoroquinolone use was 1.90 (1.22 to 2.96) for aortic aneurysm and 0.93 (0.38 to 2.29) for aortic dissection. In a propensity score matched cohort, fluoroquinolone use was associated with an increased risk of aortic aneurysm or dissection. This association appeared to be largely driven by aortic aneurysm."

At the intensive care unit for treatment with intravenous antihypertensive medication, the patient evolved with acute paraplegia and a segmental thrombotic subocclusion of the descending thoracic aorta was diagnosed. He was submitted to endovascular treatment with total recovery of the deficits. The previously normal descending thoracic aorta may be a site of segmental thrombosis and may lead to paraplegia.

Our objective was to characterize index readmissions at 30, 90, and 180 days after TEVAR. A retrospective analysis of the Nationwide Readmissions Database was performed for patients who underwent TEVAR in 2013. Multivariable analysis identified independent predictors for index readmission at 30, 90, and 180 days. There were 4045 TEVARs performed for descending thoracic aortic dissection (37.7%), nonruptured aneurysm (56%), and ruptured aneurysm (6.3%). There were 419 (11.1%) index readmissions at 30 days, 895 (23.6%) at 90 days, and 1131 (29.8%) at 180 days. The most frequent reason for index readmission was heart related at 30 days (15.5%) and aorta related at 90 days (18%) and 180 days (19.6%). Reinterventions were performed at 6.4%, 9.5%, and 9.7% of 30-, 90-, and 180-day readmissions, respectively. The majority of these included additional endovascular stent graft placement (51.9% of reinterventions at 30 days, 67.7% at 90 days, and 65.9% at 180 days). In multivariable analysis, 30-day index readmission was associated with initial ruptured presentation (odds ratio [OR], 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-3.5; P = .023) and diagnosis-related group (DRG) severity grades of moderate (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.74-2.73), major (OR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.28-4.74), and extreme (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 0.76-3.36; P = .009). Index readmission at 90 days was independently associated with initial ruptured presentation (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.18-3.01; P = .008), urgent/emergent TEVAR (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.08-1.85; P = .014), and DRG severity grades of moderate (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 0.95-2.47), major (OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.39-3.7), and extreme (OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.43-4.18; P = .002). Finally, at 180 days, initial ruptured presentation (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.05-2.62; P = .029), urgent/emergent TEVAR (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.08-1.79; P = .013), and DRG severity grades of moderate (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.01-2.38), major (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.38-3.33), and extreme (OR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.47-3.89; P = .002) were, again, independently associated with index readmission. A large portion of patients treated with TEVAR were readmitted most commonly for heart-related reasons at 30 days and aorta-related reasons at 90 and 180 days. TEVAR performed to treat initial aortic rupture and greater DRG severity grade were independently associated with an index readmission at 30, 90, and 180 days. Urgent/emergent TEVAR was independently associated with an index readmission at 90 and 180 days. These factors are important to consider in using readmissions as a quality measure."

In case 2, a 52-year-old man with progressive worsening resistant hypertension, renal dysfunction, and respiratory failure despite maximal medical therapy underwent TEVAR 8 days after onset. A CTAG was deployed from the left subclavian artery under rapid pacing, and two Zenith Dissection stents were placed, which resolved complications. In both cases, after 6 months, computed tomography (CT) scan showed complete resorption of the false lumen in the ascending aorta. TEVAR for RTAAD with complete thrombosis of false lumen in the ascending aorta can be an alternative to surgery when the primary tear is located in descending aorta."

An electrocardiogram and laboratory results were suggestive for myocardial infarction of the posterior cardiac wall. Echocardiography was indicative of aortic dissection, and a CT scan of the thoracic arteries showed a massive pulmonary thromboembolism and thrombotic occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA). The woman died shortly after admission. Autopsy confirmed the presence of thromboemboli in the right pulmonary artery and its lobar branches. Also, the anterior aortic sinus was filled with a 9 cm long thromboembolus that extended into the RCA, making it dilated and completely occluded. Another 3.5 cm long thromboembolus extended from the beginning of the left subclavian artery. A patent foramen ovale (PFO) was present. On the posterior wall of the left ventricle, there was an area suggestive of myocardial infarction, and histopathological examination confirmed that it was 24-48 hours old. The coronary circulation was \"co-dominant\". The sources of thrombotic masses were the deep veins of the lower limbs. The cause of death was myocardial infarction, caused by RCA occlusion with thromboembolus originating from the deep veins of the left lower leg after paradoxical embolism via PFO. This case illustrates that although deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary thromboembolism, and PFO are not rare findings at autopsy, their combination could be a relatively rare cause of fatal coronary artery occlusion after paradoxical embolism."

    "abstract": "Objective Despite centralisation of the provision of vascular care, not all areas in England and Wales are able to offer emergency treatment for patients with acute conditions affecting the aorta proximal to the renal arteries. While cardiothoracic centres have made network arrangements to coordinate care for the repair of type A dissections, a similar plan for vascular care is lacking. This study investigates early outcomes in patients with ruptured suprarenal aortic aneurysm or dissection (rSRAD) transferred to a specialist centre. Methods Retrospective observational study over a five-year period (2009-2014) assessing outcomes of patients with ruptured sRAD diagnosed at their local hospital and then transferred to a tertiary centre capable of offering such treatment. Results Fifty-two patients (median age 73 years, 32 male) with rSRAD were transferred and a further four died during transit. The mean distance of patient transfer was 35 miles (range 4-211 miles). One patient did not undergo intervention due to frailty and two died before reaching the operating theatre. A total of 23 patients underwent endovascular repair, 9 hybrid repair and 17 open surgery. Median follow-up was 12 months (range 1-43 months). Complications included paraplegia (n = 3), stroke (n = 2), type IA endoleak (n = 4); 30-day and in-hospital mortality were 16% and 27%. For patients discharged alive from hospital, one-year survival was 67%. Conclusions Although the number of patients with rSRAD is low and those who are transferred alive are a self-selecting group, this study suggests that transfer of such patients to a specialist vascular centre is associated with acceptable mortality rates following emergency complex aortic repair."

    "abstract": "We evaluated retrospectively 11 consecutive patients who underwent emergent aortic root operations for acute aortic dissection from April 2012 to March 2017. We underwent Bentall operation in 6 patients and Florida Sleeve repair in 3 patients and aortic root replacement with a Freestyle stentless porcine valve in 2 patients. The 30-day mortality of emergent aortic root operations was 9.1%(1 of 11), and the hospital mortality was 18.2%(2 of 11). The Overall survival at 5 years was 90.0%. In conclusion, the aortic root repair can be performed safely in acute aortic dissection."

    "abstract": "The Institute of Medicine described diagnostic error as the next frontier in patient safety and highlighted a critical need for better measurement tools. To estimate the proportions of emergency department (ED) visits attributable to symptoms of imminent ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke, aortic dissection, and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) that end in discharge without diagnosis; to evaluate longitudinal trends; and to identify patient characteristics independently associated with missed diagnostic opportunities. This was a retrospective cohort study of all Medicare claims for 2006 to 2014. The setting was hospital EDs in the United States. Participants included all fee-for-service Medicare patients admitted to the hospital during 2007 to 2014 for the conditions of interest. Hospice enrollees and patients with recent skilled nursing facility stays were excluded. The proportion of potential diagnostic opportunities missed in the ED was estimated using the difference between observed and expected ED discharges within 45 days of the index hospital admissions as the numerator, basing expected discharges on ED use by the same patients in earlier months. The denominator was estimated as the number of recognized emergencies (index hospital admissions) plus unrecognized emergencies (excess discharges). There were 1 561 940 patients, including 17 963 hospitalized for ruptured AAA, 304 980 for AMI, 1 181 648 for stroke, 19 675 for aortic dissection, and 37 674 for SAH. The mean (SD) age was 77.9 (10.3) years; 8.9% were younger than 65 years, and 54.1% were female. The proportions of diagnostic opportunities missed in the ED were as follows: ruptured AAA (3.4%; 95% CI, 2.9%-4.0%), AMI (2.3%; 95% CI, 2.1%-2.4%), stroke (4.1%; 95% CI, 4.0%-4.2%), aortic dissection (4.5%; 95% CI, 3.9%-5.1%), and SAH (3.5%; 95% CI, 3.1%-3.9%). Longitudinal trends were either nonsignificant (AMI and aortic dissection) or increasing (ruptured AAA, stroke, and SAH). Patient characteristics associated with unrecognized emergencies included age younger than 65 years, dual eligibility for Medicare and Medicaid coverage, female sex, and each of the following chronic conditions: end-stage renal disease, dementia, depression, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Among Medicare patients, opportunities to diagnose ruptured AAA, AMI, stroke, aortic dissection, and SAH are missed in less than 1 in 20 ED presentations. Further improvement may prove difficult."

    "abstract": "Acute Type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) and the ensuing surgical therapy may be experienced as a traumatic event by patients. This study aimed at analysing the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the physical and mental well-being of survivors of surgically treated ATAAD. A total of 393 survivors were contacted and asked to fill in various health questionnaires. Two hundred and ten (53%) patients returned the questionnaires. The mean follow-up was 51 ± 27.8 months. The results showed that 67.6% had high blood pressure, 12.9% had pre-existing diseases of the aorta and 31.5% or 27% of these groups were at risk for PTSD according to the health questionnaires. Duration of intensive care unit or hospital stay had no effect on the risk for PTSD. According to the questionnaire, Short Form 12, physical and mental well-being was significantly reduced in the patients compared to a large German norm sample, even after adjustment for differences in age between the 2 cohorts. Physical activity prior to the event was associated with improved physical and mental well-being but did not reduce the risk for PTSD. Emergency surgery for ATAAD is associated with high risk for PTSD, which seems to negatively affect physical and mental well-being. More efforts should be directed at prevention and early diagnosis and therapy of PTSD. This study has evaluated 8-year trends in the presentation, diagnosis and outcomes such as physical and mental measures and prevalence rates of PTSD in patients who have undergone an emergency operation for ATAAD."

    "abstract": "Aortobronchial fistula (ABF) is a rare and potentially lethal complication of thoracic aortic replacement surgery. Currently, thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has emerged as a less invasive alternative to open surgery for ABF to facilitate prompt hemostasis. However, there are no published reports of TEVAR for ABF, particularly for presentation with life-threatening respiratory failure from massive hemoptysis. A 48-year-old male patient, who had recently undergone aortic root and arch replacement due to aortic dissection, was transferred to the emergency department with massive hemoptysis and severe dyspnea. A single-lumen endotracheal tube was immediately placed in the right main bronchus to protect the nonbleeding lung from spillage of blood. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed leakage of contrast material from the distal anastomosis of the aortic graft and consolidated lung tissue adjacent to the leakage. He was diagnosed with an ABF following aortic arch replacement, and an emergency TEVAR was performed. After adequate hemostasis, severe hypercapnia remained uncorrected despite the maximum ventilatory support. Thus, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) was immediately initiated, and severe respiratory acidosis improved dramatically. Furthermore, VV ECMO facilitated prompt bronchoscopic washout of the remaining blood clot without any danger of respiratory collapse and was weaned off successfully after 5 days as ventilation improved. This case demonstrates that emergency TEVAR in combination with VV ECMO can be a rescue strategy for massive hemoptysis from an ABF."

    "abstract": "D-dimer shows high sensitivity but low specificity for the diagnosis of acute aortic dissection (AAD). Previous reports indicated that negative D-dimer patients have shorter dissection length. However, whether patients with negative D-dimer results have a good prognosis is unknown. This study aimed to elucidate the clinical characteristics and implications of a negative D-dimer result on AAD diagnosis. The study group comprised 126 patients (71 males, 55 females; mean age, 69 ± 11 years) with AAD admitted to our hospital between April 2009 and March 2015. Blood samples on presentation were used for D-dimer measurement. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were assessed. Nine (7.1%) and 117 (92.9%) exhibited negative and positive D-dimer results, respectively. The negative group showed a significantly lower extension score and a higher platelet count than the positive group. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that platelet count (odds ratio, 1.31 (1.09-1.58), p = 0.003) and extension score (odds ratio, 0.56 (0.33-0.96), p = 0.03) were significantly related to a negative result. Notably, 44% of patients in the negative group had type A dissection and 33% underwent an emergency operation due to cardiac tamponade. We found that high platelet count and low extension score were independent factors related to a negative D-dimer result. Even if the length of the dissection is short, an emergency operation is necessary in some patients with a negative D-dimer result. Physicians should recognize that a negative D-dimer result alone cannot exclude patients with fatal AAD conditions."

Between 2008 and 2015, a total of 300 patients with acute Type A aortic dissection underwent emergency surgery, consisting of 271 hemiarch repairs and 29 total aortic arch replacements, using transapical cannulation and the adventitial inversion technique at a distal anastomosis. The mean follow-up periods were 31.7 ± 25.2 months. Overall, 18% (54/300) of the patients were octogenarians, and 21.7% (65/300) had cardiac tamponade; 25% (75/300) had preoperative malperfusion. The in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates were 8.3% (25/300) and 6.7% (20/300), respectively. The 30-day mortality rate was 2.7% (6/225) among patients without preoperative malperfusion and 18.7% (14/75) among patients with malperfusion (P < 0.0001), 7.4% (4/54) among octogenarians and 6.5% (16/246) among patients aged less than 80 years (P = 0.81), and 6.3% (17/271) among patients treated with hemiarch repair and 10.3% (3/29) among patients treated with total aortic arch replacement (P = 0.403). Preoperative malperfusion was an independent predictor of perioperative mortality in a multivariable analysis. During the follow-up period, distal reintervention was performed in 11% (33/300) of the patients. The rates of freedom from reintervention at 1, 3 and 5 years were 95.9%, 88.9% and 80.0%, respectively. The overall survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were 88.7%, 86.7% and 82.0%, respectively. The in-hospital mortality rate for elective reintervention was 3.0% (1/33). Aortic repair via transapical cannulation and the adventitial inversion technique for acute Type A aortic dissection provides good early and mid-term results. The safety of elective distal reintervention can be guaranteed. To obtain better operative outcomes, effective treatment for cases with malperfusion is mandatory."

Transthoracic echocardiography revealed moderate left ventricular dysfunction and a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). In addition, he was noted to have a dilated thoracic aorta concerning for a dissection, severe aortic insufficiency (AI), and both a pericardial and pleural effusion. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a Type A ascending aortic dissection. He was taken emergently to the operating room for repair. An intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography examination was performed which revealed a normal trileaflet AV with a Type A aortic dissection flap masquerading as a BAV. The dissection flap interfered with both the valve's function, causing severe AI, as well as the valve's appearance, causing it to look bicuspid on echocardiography."

The US-CAB protocol was implemented at the emergency department of National Taiwan University Hospital since January 2016. The US images, initiation time and operation duration of each US-CAB procedure, and relevant CPR information were recorded for analysis. From January 2016 to March 2017, 177 cardiac arrest patients receiving US-CAB were included. The durations of US-C-A-B procedure were 9.0 ± 1.4, 7.5 ± 1.5, and 16.0 ± 1.9 s, respectively. Cardiac activity was identified in 47 cases (26.6%), with higher rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) (95.7% vs. 21.5%, p < .0001) and survival to hospital discharge (25.5% vs. 10.0%, p < .01). Detection of cardiac activity after 10 min of CPR exhibited 100% sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value for ROSC. Cardiac tamponade was noted in eight patients. ROSC was achieved in two (25.0%) after pericardiocentesis, and aortic dissection was diagnosed in one (12.5%). Confirmation of correct intubation was significantly faster by US than by capnography (7.4 ± 1.4 vs. 38.3 ± 110.2 s, p < .001). US detected 21 (11.9%) esophageal intubations and 3 (1.7%) one-lung intubations. All were promptly corrected. The US-CAB protocol is feasible in real CPR scenarios. It confers diagnostic value and prognostic implications which potentially impact the efficacy and outcomes of CPR. However, a future prospective multi-center study to validate its feasibility and indicate the need of structured training is mandated."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a life-threatening condition making early diagnosis critical. Although 90% present with acute pain, the myriad of associated symptoms can make diagnosis a challenge. Our objective was to assess how we are using computed tomography to rule out acute aortic dissection specifically rate of ordering, diagnostic yield, and variation in practice. We included consecutive adult patients presenting to two tertiary academic care emergency departments over one calendar year presenting with non-traumatic chest, back, abdominal, or flank pain. Primary outcome was rate of CT thorax/abdomen ordered to rule out AAD. Secondary outcome was variation in CT ordering, measured comparing number of CTs ordered per physician. Sample size of 12 per group was calculated based on an expected delta in mean CT ordered of 5 and a within group SD of 3. Thirty-one thousand two hundred one patients presented with truncal pain during the study period, 22,729 were included (mean 47 years, SD 18.5 years, 56.2% female); prevalence of AAD (N = 4) was 0.02%. CT was ordered to rule out AAD in 175 (0.7%) patients (mean 62 years, SD 16.5, 50.6% female). Significant variation between physicians ordering was found, with individual physicians ordering varying from 0.6 to 12%. Current rate of imaging for acute aortic dissection is low and potentially inefficient, with a large variation in practice. These findings suggest potential for more standardized and efficient use of CT for the diagnosis of acute aortic dissection."

We included patients who underwent emergent aortic repair for acute Type A aortic dissection at our university hospital between 2000 and 2016. We identified patients who underwent valve-sparing root replacement from the included cohort and assessed their survival and long-term valve durability. We identified 24 of 328 patients who underwent valve-sparing root replacement (age: mean ± SD 49 ± 11 years; 17 men). All patients underwent reimplantation procedures and 2 had concomitant cusp repairs (central plication). Prolapsed cusps caused by detached commissures in 12 cases were noted and reattached with buttress sutures with or without glue. There was no in-hospital mortality. Median follow-up period was 84 months (range 1-202 months) and survival was 100% at 5 and 10 years. Freedom from moderate or greater aortic insufficiency was 82% ± 10% at 5 years and 65% ± 13% at 10 years. Freedom from aortic valve reoperation was 83% ± 9% at 5 years and 69% ± 12% at 10 years. Valve reoperations were indicated for endocarditis in 1 patient, perforation of the aortic cusp in 1 patient and redetachment of commissures that had been attached with gelatin-resorcinol-formaldehyde glue at the initial operations in 3 patients. The durability of valve-sparing root replacement in acute aortic dissection was suboptimal. The major cause of late failure was commissure detachment after primary repair with buttress sutures and glue. Gelatin-resorcinol-formaldehyde glue should be avoided for commissural resuspension in patients with acute aortic dissection."

Between 2000 and 2017, 303 (71.9% men, mean age 58.9 ± 13.6 years) patients with acute type A aortic dissection underwent surgical repair. Clinical and imaging data were retrospectively evaluated. Patients were divided into 2 groups depending on the presence of postoperative stroke. Postoperative stroke was detected in 15.8% (n = 48) of the patients. Patients with postoperative stroke showed higher rates of preoperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation (stroke: 18.8% vs no stroke: 3.5%, P < 0.001) and malperfusion syndrome (stroke: 47.9% vs no stroke: 22.4%, P < 0.001). Multivariable analysis identified the presence of bovine aortic arch [odds ratio (OR) 2.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.086-4.998; P = 0.030], preoperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation (OR 6.483, 95% CI 1.522-27.616; P = 0.011) and preoperative malperfusion (OR 2.536, 95% CI 1.238-5.194; P = 0.011) as independent predictors for postoperative stroke. Postoperative stroke had a strong impact on morbidity and was associated with higher rates of postoperative complications and a significantly longer hospital stay (stroke: 23 ± 16 days vs no stroke: 17 ± 18 days, P = 0.021). Postoperative stroke was not independently associated with in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR 1.382, 95% CI 0.518-3.687; P = 0.518).

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection (AD) is a life-threatening medical emergency caused by the abrupt destruction of the intimomedial layer of the aortic walls. Given that previous studies have reported the involvement of proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 in AD pathogenesis, we investigated the role of signal transduction and activator of transcription 3 signaling, a downstream pathway of interleukin-6 in macrophages in pathogenesis of AD. We characterized the pathological and molecular events triggered by aortic stress, which can lead to AD. Aortic stress on the suprarenal aorta because of infrarenal aorta stiffening and angiotensin II infusion for 1 week caused focal medial rupture at the branching point of the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery. This focal medial rupture healed in 6 weeks in wild-type (WT) mice, but progressed to AD in mice with macrophage-specific deletion of Socs3 gene (mSocs3-KO). mSocs3-KO mice showed premature activation of cell proliferation, an inflammatory response, and skewed differentiation of macrophages toward the tissue-destructive phenotype. Concomitantly, they showed aberrant phenotypic modulation of smooth muscle cells and transforming growth factor beta signaling, which are likely to participate in tissue repair. Human AD samples revealed signal transduction and activator of transcription 3 activation in adventitial macrophages adjacent to the site of tissue destruction. These findings suggest that AD development is preceded by focal medial rupture, in which macrophage Socs3 maintains proper inflammatory response and differentiation of SMCs, thus promoting fibrotic healing to prevent tissue destruction and AD development. Understanding the sequence of the pathological and molecular events preceding AD development will help predict and prevent AD development and progression."

Among them were 100 patients aged 75 years or more (mean, 78 ± 3; range, 75-88 years), including 17 patients operated on an emergency basis because of acute aortic dissection. None/trivial, mild, moderate, and severe insufficiency grades were presented in 9, 23, 27, and 41 patients, respectively. The surgery comprised root repair, cusp repair, and a combination of both in 45, 16, and 39 patients, respectively. Early (30-day) mortality and the rate of permanent neurologic deficit were 2% for each. The follow-up was 99% complete, resulting in 427 patient/years. During the follow-up period (mean duration, 4.3 ± 3.2; range, 0.02-11.1 years), only 1 patient developed a relevant aortic insufficiency and required aortic valve reoperation. There were 24 late deaths, which occurred on average 50.0 ± 40.6 months (range, 2.4-135.0) after surgery at the average patient age of 82 ± 5 years (range, 75-90). Estimated survival at 5 and 8 years was 76.4% ± 5.1% and 71.3% ± 5.9%, respectively, and was similar to those of the sex- and age-matched general population. Reconstructive aortic valve surgery is a suitable and justifiable surgical option in selected elderly patients undergoing operation by surgeons with considerable experience in this kind of surgery. It offers low cardiac and valve-related mortality and morbidity, leading to life expectancy applicable to the patients' ages."

Of these transported by EMS, 22,075 had any of the AAS-related symptoms, and 330 had an EMS-assessed risk for AAS; of these, 195 received an in-hospital AAS diagnosis. Of the remaining 21,745 patients without EMS-assessed risk, 166 were diagnosed with AAS. Therefore, the sensitivity and specificity of our EMS-risk assessment for AAS was 54.0% (195/361) and 99.4% (21,579/21,714), respectively. EMS assessed the risk less frequently when patients were elderly and presented with dyspnea and syncope/faintness. Sign of upper extremity ischemia was rarely detected (6.9%) and absence of this sign was associated with lack of EMS-assessed risk. The calculation of modified aortic dissection detection risk score revealed that rigorous assessment based on this score may increase the EMS sensitivity for AAS. The 1-month survival rate was significantly higher in patients admitted to core hospitals with surgical teams for AAS than in those admitted to all other hospitals [87.5% (210/240) vs 69.4% (84/121); P<0.01]. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that Stanford type A, Glasgow coma scale ≤14, and admission to core hospitals providing emergency cardiovascular surgery were associated with 1-month survival. Improvement of AAS survival is likely to be affected by rapid admission to appropriate hospitals providing cardiovascular surgery."

    "abstract": "A 69-year-old man presented to the emergency department with back pain and paraplegia. Computed tomography showed acute type A aortic dissection with a primary tear right below the origin of the left subclavian artery. He had undergone endovascular aneurysm repair 13 months earlier, and the previously inserted endovascular graft had totally collapsed. Total arch replacement covering the primary entry tear was performed. Femoral pulse was undetected before the operation but was monitored postsurgically after cardiopulmonary bypass was weaned. The patient was discharged from the hospital on foot without an additional intervention."

Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography performed in the intensive care unit showed only slight left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, but intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography after induction of anesthesia revealed pericardial effusion, systolic anterior motion(SAM), and associated mitral regurgitation(MR). Perioperative SAM and MR are sometimes facilitated under various hemodynamic conditions, but in this case, the left ventricular wall was thick and LVOT appeared to be obstructive by a hypertrophied septum. Structural hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) was diagnosed, and septal myectomy and aortic replacement were performed. After ascending aortic replacement and simultaneous extended myectomy with resection of abnormal band, weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass was smooth without SAM and MR. The patient was discharged from hospital 24 days postoperatively with no major complications. Extended myectomy should be considered if structural HOCM is diagnosed, even when aortic replacement for the dissected aorta is the primary procedure."

We performed emergency open conversion with circulatory arrest under deep hypothermia. The tip of the chimney graft (around the sino-tubular junction in the ascending aorta) was stiff, making it difficult to inspect the lumen and perform anastomosis. Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest and cutting the endograft stents to mobilize the graft were necessary for secure anastomosis."

Hemorrhagic cardiac tamponade due to the rupture of an ascending aortic root dissection is extremely dangerous and often lacks timely clinical evidence. We report sudden death in a patient diagnosed with AAAD and in whom critical care ultrasound highly indicated hemorrhagic cardiac tamponade. A 75-year-old man was admitted to our emergency department with a complaint of chest pain for 8 hours. Computed tomography angiography findings indicated AAAD with a wide range of lesions. During the preoperative preparation process, he suddenly lost consciousness with a pulseless femoral artery.Diagnoses: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated and critical care ultrasound revealed hemorrhagic cardiac tamponade, strongly indicating the rupture of an ascending aortic root dissection. However, family members refused further surgical interventions. The etiology could not be reversed and the patient died. Critical care ultrasound is an important skill that intensivists should master for fast screening of life-threatening complications in patients with AAAD."

    "abstract": "A 77-year-old man presented with acute-onset severe chest pain radiating to the back and elevated blood pressure. Multiphasic computed tomography of the aorta revealed an intimal tear in the descending thoracic aorta which extended both retrograde to the aortic root and antegrade to the infra-renal abdominal aorta. The initial impression, that the images showed a Stanford type B aortic dissection, was because the portion of the false lumen that extended beyond the aortic arch remained unopacified even on delayed phases, making it challenging to assess the extent of the dissection flap. Bedside transthoracic echocardiography revealed a pericardial effusion. Cardiac tamponade ensued and the patient passed away shortly after presentation. This case highlights the need for early and accurate imaging assessment of acute aortic dissection, including accurate identification of the site of intimal tear and the extent of the dissection flap."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a rare condition with a high mortality that is often missed. The objective of our study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of clinical and laboratory findings for AAD, in confirmed cases of AAD and in a low-risk control group. This was a historical matched case-control study: participants were adults > 18 years old presenting to two tertiary care emergency departments (EDs) or one regional cardiac referral center. Cases were patients with new ED or in-hospital diagnosis of nontraumatic AAD confirmed by computed tomography or echocardiography. Controls were patients with a triage diagnosis of truncal pain (<14 days) and an absence of a clear diagnosis on basic investigation. Cases and controls were matched in a 1:4 ratio by sex and age. A sample size of 165 cases and 660 controls was calculated based on 80% power and confidence interval of 95% to detect an odds ratio of greater than 2. Data were collected from 2002 to 2014 yielding 194 cases of AAD and 776 controls (mean ± SD age = 65 ± 14.1 years; 66.7% male). Absence of abrupt-onset pain (sensitivity = 95.9%, negative likelihood ratio = 0.07 [0.03-0.14]) can help rule out AAD. Presence of tearing/ripping pain (specificity = 99.7%, positive likelihood ratio [LR+] = 42.1 [9.9-177.5]), aortic aneurysm (specificity = 97.8%, LR+ = 6.35 [3.54-11.42]), hypotension (specificity = 98.7%, LR+ = 17.2 [8.8-33.6]), pulse deficit (specificity = 99.3, LR+ = 31.1 [11.2-86.6]), neurologic deficits (specificity = 96.9%, LR+ = 5.26 [2.9-9.3]), and a new murmur (specificity = 97.8%, LR+ = 9.4 [5.5-16.2]) can help rule in the diagnosis of AAD. Patients with one or more high-risk feature should be considered high risk, whereas patients with no high-risk and multiple low-risk features are at low risk for AAD."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a life-threatening cardiovascular disease with the high morbidity and mortality. Imaging modalities are the gold standard for the diagnosis of AAD; however, they are not always available in emergency department. Biomarker-assisted diagnosis is important for the early treatment of AAD. The aim of the present study was to identify potential microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers for AAD. Differentially expressed plasma miRNAs between AAD patients and age-matched healthy volunteers were analyzed by miRNA microarray. Quantitative RT-PCR was further performed to verify the expression of selected miRNAs (miR-4787-5p and miR-4306) with an increased number of samples. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the diagnostic value of miR-4787-5p and miR-4306 as biomarkers for distinguishing AAD. Using TargetScan and miRanda, miR-4787-5p and miR-4306 were selected to predict target gene related to cytokines detecting by dual luciferase assay and western blotting. Nine upregulated and twelve downregulated miRNAs were identified in the circulating plasma of AAD patients. qRT-PCR verified statistically consistent expression of two selected miRNAs with microarray analysis. ROC analyses demonstrated that miR-4787-5p and miR-4306 were specific and sensitive for the early diagnosis of AAD. Bioinformatic predictions and dual luciferase assay suggested that polycystin-1 (PKD1) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) were respectively direct target of miR-4787-5p and miR-4306. Furthermore, the protein expression of the downstream targets of PKD1 and TGF-β1 were significantly reduced following overexpression of miR-4787-5p and miR-4306. These results revealed that miR-4787-5p and miR-4306 could be developed as diagnostic potential biomarkers for AAD, and they could be involved in the pathogenesis of AAD."

He did not have a Marfan syndrome (MFS)-like appearance, and had a history of a type B aortic dissection and total arch replacement. A connective tissue disorder had been suspected because of the histologic findings of the resected aortic wall. On admission, a computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a three-channeled aortic dissection (3ch-AD) measuring 63 mm in diameter. We planned to perform elective surgery during his hospitalization. On the fourth hospital day, he complained of severe back pain, and enhanced CT scan revealed an aortic rupture. The patients with 3ch-AD often have MFS. However, even if they do not have an MFS-like appearance, clinicians should consider fragility of the aortic wall in patients with 3ch-AD. If the aortic diameter is enlarged, early surgery is recommended. In particular, if a connective tissue disorder is obvious or suspected, emergent surgery is warranted."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this research is to analyze factors associated with delays to surgical management of Type A acute aortic dissection patients. Time from diagnosis to surgery and associated factors were evaluated in 1880 surgically managed Type A dissection patients enrolled in the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection. The majority of patients were transferred (75.7% vs 24.3%). Patients who were transferred had a median delay from diagnosis to surgery of 4.0 hours (interquartile range 2.5-7.2 hours), compared with 2.3 hours (interquartile range 1.1-4.2 hours; P < .001) in nontransferred patients. Among patients who were transferred, those with worst-ever, posterior, or tearing chest pain those with severe complications, and those receiving transthoracic echocardiogram prior to a transesophageal echocardiogram or as the only echocardiogram were treated more quickly. Those undergoing magnetic resonance imaging, or who had prior cardiac surgery, had longer delays to surgery. Among nontransferred patients, those with coma were treated more quickly. In both groups, patients presenting with emergent conditions such as cardiac tamponade, hypotension, or shock had more rapid treatment. Among transferred patients, surviving patients had longer delays (4.1 [2.6-7.8] hours vs 3.3 [2.0-6.0] hours, P = .001). Overall mortality did not differ between patients who were transferred vs not (19.3% vs 21.1%, P = .416). Simply being transferred added significantly to the delay to surgery for Type A acute aortic dissection patients, but a number of factors affected its extent. Overall, signs and symptoms leading to a definitive diagnosis or indicating immediate life threat reduced time to surgery, while factors suggesting other diagnoses correlated with delays."

The incremental operative risk of adding ARE to AVR has not been established. We aimed to evaluate the early outcomes of patients undergoing AVR with or without ARE. From January 1990 to August 2014, 7039 patients underwent AVR (AVR+ARE, n=1854; AVR, n=5185) at a single institution. Patients with aortic dissection and active endocarditis were excluded. Mean age was 65±14 years and 63% were male. Logistic regression and propensity score matching were used to adjust for unbalanced variables in group comparisons. Patients undergoing AVR+ARE were more likely to be female (46% versus 34%, P<0.001) and had higher rates of previous cardiac surgery (18% versus 12%, P<0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (5% versus 3%, P=0.004), urgent/emergent status (6% versus 4%, P=0.01), and worse New York Heart Association status (P<0.001). Most patients received bioprosthetic valves (AVR+ARE: 73.4% versus AVR: 73.3%, P=0.98) and also underwent concomitant cardiac procedures (AVR+ARE: 68% versus AVR: 67%, P=0.31). Mean prosthesis size implanted was slightly smaller in patients requiring AVR+ARE versus AVR (23.4±2.1 versus 24.1±2.3, P<0.001). In-hospital mortality was higher after AVR+ARE (4.3% versus 3.0%, P=0.008), although when the cohort was restricted to patients undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement with or without root enlargement, mortality was not statistically different (AVR+ARE: 1.7% versus AVR: 1.1%, P=0.29). After adjustment for baseline characteristics, AVR+ARE was not associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality when compared with AVR (odds ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 0.75-1.41; P=0.85). Furthermore, AVR+ARE was not associated with an increased risk of postoperative adverse events. Results were similar if propensity matching was used instead of multivariable adjustments for baseline characteristics. In the largest analysis to date, ARE was not associated with increased risk of mortality or adverse events. Surgical ARE is a safe adjunct to AVR in the modern era."

Computed tomographic angiography could not clearly delineate an intimal flap in the aortic root, but it detected SMA aneurysm, which implied the presence of a vulnerability of the aortic wall. Finally, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) evidently showed the intimal flap localized in the aortic root. The present case suggests that TEE is of paramount importance for detecting localized aortic root dissection. In addition, a coexisting vascular lesion may be a clue to diagnose another vascular lesion."

The extent to which sST2 is elevated in AAD and whether sST2 can discriminate AAD from other causes of sudden-onset severe chest pain are unknown. We measured plasma concentrations of sST2 (R&D Systems assay) in 1360 patients, including 1027 participants in the retrospective discovery set and 333 patients with initial suspicion of AAD enrolled in the prospective validation cohort. Measures of discrimination for differentiating AAD from other causes of chest pain were calculated. In the acute phase, sST2 levels were higher in patients with AAD than those with either acute myocardial infarction in the first case-control discovery set within 24 hours of symptom onset or with patients with pulmonary embolism in the second discovery set (medians of 129.2 ng/mL versus 14.7 with P<0.001 for AAD versus acute myocardial infarction and 88.6 versus 9.3 with P<0.001 for AAD versus pulmonary embolism). In the prospective validation set, sST2 was most elevated in patients with AAD (median [25th, 75th percentile]: 76.4 [49.6, 130.3]) and modestly elevated in acute myocardial infarction (25.0 [15.5, 37.2]), pulmonary embolism (14.9 [10.2, 30.1]), and angina patients (21.5 [13.1, 27.6], all P<0.001 versus AAD). The area under receiver operating characteristic curve for patients with AAD versus all control patients within 24 hours of presenting at the emergency department was 0.97 (0.95, 0.98) for sST2, 0.91 (0.88, 0.94) for D-dimer, and 0.50 (0.44, 0.56) for cardiac troponin I, respectively. At a cutoff level of 34.6 ng/mL, sST2 had a sensitivity of 99.1%, specificity of 84.9%, positive predictive value of 68.7%, negative predictive value of 99.7%, positive likelihood ratio of 6.6, and negative likelihood ratio of 0.01. Among patients with suspected aortic dissection in the emergency department, sST2 showed superior overall diagnostic performance to D-dimer or cardiac troponin I. Additional study is needed to determine whether sST2 might be a useful rule-out marker for AAD in the emergency room."

The field of radiology is no exception. In this paper, we assess the readability level of websites pertaining specifically to emergency radiology. Using Google, 23 terms were searched, and the top 10 results were recorded. Each link was evaluated for its readability level using a set of ten reputable readability scales. The search terms included the following: abdominal ultrasound, abdominal aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection, appendicitis, cord compression, CT abdomen, cholecystitis, CT chest, diverticulitis, ectopic pregnancy, epidural hematoma, dural venous thrombosis, head CT, MRI brain, MR angiography, MRI spine, ovarian torsion, pancreatitis, pelvic ultrasound, pneumoperitoneum, pulmonary embolism, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and subdural hematoma. Any content that was not written for patients was excluded. The 230 articles that were assessed were written, on average, at a 12.1 grade level. Only 2 of the 230 articles (1%) were written at the third to seventh grade recommended reading level set forth by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and American Medical Association (AMA). Fifty-two percent of the 230 articles were written so as to require a minimum of a high school education (at least a 12th grade level). Additionally, 17 of the 230 articles (7.3%) were written at a level that exceeded an undergraduate education (at least a 16th grade level). The majority of websites with emergency radiology-related patient education materials are not adhering to the NIH and AMA's recommended reading levels, and it is likely that the average reader is not benefiting fully from these information outlets. With the link between health literacy and poor health outcomes, it is important to address the online content in this area of radiology, allowing for patient to more fully benefit from their online searches."

We report our two-center experience of vaECMO during life-threatening complications in TAVI. From January 2010 to December 2015, 1,810 consecutive patients underwent TAVI at two centers. Clinical characteristics, type of complication, outcome and temporal trends in the requirement of emergency vaECMO were evaluated. Life-threatening complications requiring vaECMO occurred in 1.8% of cases (33 patients; 22 transfemoral, 11 transapical). Indications for vaECMO were ventricular rupture (30%, 10/33), low output (15%, 5/33), bleeding (12%, 4/33), coronary artery impairment (9%, 3/33), ventricular arrhythmias (6%, 2/33), severe aortic regurgitation (6%, 2/33), aortic annular rupture (6%, 2/33), and aortic dissection (3%, 1/33). In 4 cases, no definite cause for hemodynamic instability was identified. Conversion to open heart surgery was necessary in 42% of patients (14/33). Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in all cases with coronary artery impairment (9%, 3/33). Patients with severe aortic regurgitation (6%, 2/33) underwent emergency valve-in-valve implantation. Other patients received, in addition to vaECMO support conservative treatment (42%, 14/33). In-hospital mortality and 30-day mortality were 46% (15/33). Of patients discharged, 67% (12/18) had no neurological impairment, whereas mild and severe neurological impairment was found in 11% (2/18) and 22% (4/18), respectively. From 2010 to 2015, with increasing procedures (from n = 43 to n = 553) requirement of vaECMO decreased from 9.3% to 0.9% (P for the trend <0.001). Over a 6-year period, need for emergency vaECMO during TAVI significantly decreased over time. Despite high in-hospital mortality, vaECMO represents a feasible strategy for hemodynamic support in case of life-threatening complications."

A 58-year-old woman presented with sudden-onset chest discomfort and loss of consciousness. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed mild aortic regurgitation. Enhanced computed tomography scans showed no obvious intimal tear or flap at the proximal ascending aorta, but an intimal flap was observed from the aortic arch to both common iliac arteries. Stanford type B dissection was tentatively diagnosed. Repeat detailed transthoracic echocardiography examination showed an intimal tear and flap at the ascending aorta; prolapse into the left ventricle caused severe aortic regurgitation. Type A aortic dissection was definitively diagnosed; emergent operation showed a circumferential intimal tear originating from the ascending aorta. The ascending aorta was replaced; aortic regurgitation disappeared. The patient was discharged in a good condition 58 days postoperatively. Dynamic evaluations with transthoracic echocardiography should be carried out to diagnose circumferential aortic dissection."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic syndromes (AAS) encompass a constellation of life-threatening medical conditions including classic acute aortic dissection (AAD), intramural haematoma, and penetrating atherosclerotic aortic ulcer. Given the non-specific symptoms and physical signs, a high clinical index of suspicion is necessary to detect the disease before irreversible lethal complications occur. In order to reduce the diagnostic time delay, a comprehensive flowchart for decision-making based on pre-test sensitivity of AAS has been designed by the European Society of Cardiology guidelines on aortic diseases and should be thus applied in the emergency scenario. When the definitive diagnosis is made, prompt and appropriate therapeutic interventions should be undertaken if indicated by a highly specialized aortic team. Urgent surgery for AAD involving the ascending aorta (Type A) and medical therapy alone for AAD not involving the ascending aorta (Type B) are typically recommended. In complicated Type B AAD, thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is generally indicated. On the other hand, in uncomplicated Type B AAD, pre-emptive TEVAR rather than medical therapy alone to prevent late complications, while intuitive, requires further study in randomized cohorts. Finally, it should be highlighted that there is an urgent need to increase awareness of AAS worldwide, including dedicated education/prevention programmes, and to improve diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, outcomes, and lifelong surveillance."

Because chest pain is a common manifestation of type A acute aortic dissection (TAAAD), ECGs are obtained in much of this population. We evaluated the effect of particular ECG patterns on the diagnosis and treatment of TAAAD. TAAAD patients (N = 2,765) enrolled in the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection were stratified based on normal (n = 1,094 [39.6%]) and abnormal (n = 1,671 [60.4%]) findings on presenting ECGs and further subdivided according to specific ECG findings. Time data are presented in hours as medians (quartile 1 to quartile 3). Patients with ECGs with abnormal findings presented to the hospital sooner after symptom onset than those with ECGs with normal findings (1.4 [0.8 to 3.3] vs 2.0 [1.0 to 3.3]; p = 0.005). Specifically, this was seen in patients with infarction with new Q waves or ST elevation (1.3 [0.6 to 2.7] vs 1.5 [0.8 to 3.3]; p = 0.049). Interestingly, the time between symptom onset and diagnosis was longer with infarction with old Q waves (6.7 [3.2 to 18.4] vs 5.0 [2.9 to 11.8]; p = 0.034) and nonspecific ST-T changes (5.8 [3.0 to 13.8] vs 4.5 [2.8 to 10.5]; p = 0.002). Surgical mortality was higher in patients with abnormal ECG findings (20.6% vs 11.9%, p < 0.001), especially in those with ischemia by ECG (25.7% vs 16.8%, p < 0.001) and infarction with new Q waves or ST elevation (30.1% vs 17.1%, p < 0.001). TAAAD patients presenting with abnormal ECG results are sicker, have more in-hospital complications, and are more likely to die. The frequency of nonspecific ST-T abnormalities and its association with delay in diagnosis and treatment presents an opportunity for practice improvement."

The scan revealed an echogenic flap in the ascending aorta, significant aortic regurgitation, and intimal flaps in the carotid artery and abdominal aorta. The diagnosis of a type A aortic dissection was confirmed with computed tomography angiography. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Differentiating an acute STEMI from an aortic dissection can be extremely difficult in the ED. It is important not to delay reperfusion therapy for patients with a true STEMI; however, the same treatment can be lethal for patients with aortic dissection. Emergency POCUS is a fast and accessible test that has been shown to have high specificity for the diagnosis of aortic dissection in the ED. POCUS may be a useful tool to help emergency physicians diagnose aortic dissection presenting with STEMI."

    "abstract": "Although surgical outcomes of acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) have improved, it is still a high-risk procedure for octogenarians. This study analyzed early and late outcomes of surgical repair of ATAAD among octogenarians. From 1990 through 2016, 1,260 consecutive patients with ATAAD were emergently admitted to Jichi Medical University Hospitals. Of them, 1,026 patients who underwent emergency surgery for ATAAD within 48 hours of symptom onset were included in this retrospective study. Of these, 112 were aged 80 years or more (mean, 83.1 ± 2.7) and formed the octogenarian group; and 914 were aged less than 80 years (mean, 62.0 ± 11.4) and formed the control group. Early and late outcomes were compared. The inhospital mortality rate was 6.3% for the octogenarian group and 7.4% for the control group (p = 0.85). No significant difference was observed in the causes of hospital death. Although the overall postoperative complication rate was not different (24.1% versus 23.0%), pneumonia was more frequent among octogenarians (p = 0.03). Multivariate analysis of hospital mortality did not indicate age 80 years or more as a risk factor. Overall postoperative survival for the octogenarian group was 84.6%, 70.5%, and 57.1% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. For the control group, the rates were 89.1%, 85.6%, and 82.1%, respectively. Pneumonia and decrepitude were the major causes of remote death for the octogenarian group. No significant difference in the hospital mortality rate or the complication rate was observed between the groups. Emergency surgery for ATAAD in octogenarians could be performed with the same low risk observed for younger patients."

    "abstract": "Preoperative diagnosis of aortic sarcomas is often difficult. Herein, we describe a case of a 68-year-old man who had an aortic intimal sarcoma with aortic wall hypertrophy that masqueraded as a thrombosed aortic dissection or mural thrombus on computed tomography. Because of the sudden appearance and rapid growth of the tumour surrounding the left subclavian artery with precordial pain and haemosputum, left subclavian arterial rupture caused by aortic dissection was suspected, requiring emergent total arch replacement. Surgery revealed an intimal sarcoma, not an aortic dissection, with the thickening of the fragile intima spreading into the aorta. Thus, an intramurally spreading aortic intimal sarcoma should be suspected when computed tomography reveals an irregular thickening of the aortic intima."

She underwent a successful emergency total arch replacement, but severe hypoxemia persisted and Pao2/Fio2 lowered to 71.9 mmHg. We therefore applied high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV), which soon improved the hypoxemia without hemodynamic compromise. HFJV was discontinued three days later, when her Pao2/Fio2 improved to 170.0 mmHg. Weaning from the respirator was initiated on postoperative day 13. The patient was extubated on postoperative day 19 and was discharged on postoperative day 74 free from disabilities. HFJV may be effective for severe hypoxemia after cardiovascular surgery."

Here, we report an 82-year-old patient with a history of cerebral infarction and cerebral bleeding who presented with a depressed level of consciousness and who was in a state of shock. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed cardiac tamponade associated with retrograde type A aortic dissection(RAAD), with a primary entry tear at a distal site of the left subclavian artery. We therefore performed emergent primary entry closure with stent grafting using the Conformable Gore Tag device and emergent drainage of the cardiac tamponade with subxiphoid pericardiotomy. Postoperative CT scan showed complete closure of the primary entry tear and a completely thrombosed false lumen. Primary entry closure with stent grafting could be an effective option for RAAD that meets anatomical criteria."

We selected 16 microRNAs from microarray screening as candidates for further testing via qRT-PCR. The results showed that plasma miR-15a in patients with AAD (n = 37) had significantly higher expression levels than it from control group (n = 40; P = 0.008). By receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the sensitivity was 75.7%; the specificity was 82.5%; and the AUC was 0.761 for detection of AAD. Furthermore, 37 patients with AAD had significantly higher plasma expression levels of let-7b, miR-15a, miR-23a and hcmv-miR-US33-5p compared with 14 CP patients of 40 controls (P = 0.000, 0.000, 0.026 and 0.011, respectively).

However, there have been few articles with regard to this important issue. We assessed the influence of PFL caused by DANE on long-term outcomes. One hundred twenty-two patients underwent emergency surgery for acute type I aortic dissection (2007-12). The in-hospital mortality was 8% (10 patients). Among the survivors, 93 patients (mean age 67 years) underwent enhanced computed tomography within 2 weeks after the operation. These patients were divided into 3 groups according to the status of the residual FL: those with a PFL with DANE (n = 19) or without DANE (n = 27) and those with a thrombosed FL (n = 47). Changes in descending aortic diameter were analysed between early and last follow-up images. Aortic growth rate in the PFL with DANE group was greater than that of the other 2 groups (P < 0.05). The PFL with DANE group demonstrated a lower rate of freedom from dissection-related event of distal aorta (66% at 5 years) and enlargement of distal aortic lesions (62% at 5 years). There were no significant differences in late survival among the groups. PFL with DANE was one of the significant risk factors for distal aortic events. PFL caused by DANE after acute type I aortic dissection repair showed greater aortic growth rate of the descending aorta and was one of the significant risk factors for distal aortic events."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is a lethal cardiovascular emergency that continues to pose a diagnostic dilemma to the emergency physician. The condition is rare, can present atypically and is associated with a cumulative mortality for every hour that passes. While it is a recognised differential of acute chest pain, its prevalence in comparison to other causes often leads to the diagnosis being overlooked. The ED is a busy environment with high patient turnover and varying degrees of complexity and acuity. This increases susceptibility to cognitive bias and error-producing conditions that can lead to delayed or missed diagnosis. In reported cases where aortic dissection has been missed, clinician awareness of the disease was not the primary issue but failure to respond to clinical cues suggestive of aortic dissection was. To improve patient outcomes for this condition, it is important for clinicians to be aware of pertinent cognitive bias and error-producing conditions."

    "abstract": "Endovascular aortic repair is increasingly being used to treat aneurysms, dissections, and traumatic injuries, despite its unknown long-term durability. We describe our 19-year experience with open descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic repair after endovascular aortic repair. Between 1996 and 2015, 67 patients were treated with open distal arch, descending thoracic, or thoracoabdominal aortic repair, or extra-anatomic bypass repair with aortic extirpation for complications after endovascular repair of the thoracic (n = 45, 67%) or abdominal (n = 22, 33%) aorta. The median interval between procedures was 18.0 months (interquartile range, 3.9-44.9). Indications for open repair included expanding aneurysm (n = 56), infection (n = 11), fistula (n = 8), aneurysm rupture (n = 5), pseudoaneurysm (n = 2), and restenosis (n = 1). Open repair involved partial (n = 9, 13%) or complete (n = 56, 84%) device removal or device salvage (n = 2, 3%) through a thoracoabdominal (n = 58, 87%) or thoracotomy (n = 9, 13%) incision. Eight patients (12%) underwent emergency procedures. There were 3 early (operative) deaths (2 with preoperative device infection) and 19 late deaths during a median follow-up of 35.8 months (interquartile range, 16.8-52.8 months). Overall 1- and 5-year survivals were 85% ± 4% and 60% ± 8%, respectively. Four patients had open repair failures necessitating reoperation; 2 patients had preoperative infection, and both died (1 early and 1 late). Open repair for complications after endovascular procedures is not uncommon. Experienced centers can yield acceptable outcomes, especially in patients without infection. Close surveillance is mandatory after endovascular aortic repair."

    "abstract": "Although bovine serum albumin-glutaraldehyde glue (BioGlue®) has been successfully used as a hemostatic adjunct in aortic surgical procedures, there are reports that it may lead to anastomotic pseudoaneurysm formation. We seek to examine if the use of BioGlue is associated with a high incidence of anastomotic pseudoaneurysm formation following surgical repair of thoracic aortic disease. We reviewed the medical records and follow-up computed tomography (CT) scans of patients from 2001 to 2015 in whom BioGlue was used during surgical repair of thoracic aortic disease to detect postoperative anastomotic pseudoaneurysm formation. A total of 233 patients with BioGlue use were identified. Mean age was 63.5±14.0 years (median 66; range 14-88; 25-75%, IQR 54-74 years) and 149 were male (63.9%). Surgical indication was thoracic aortic aneurysm in 169 (72.5%) patients, aortic dissection in 49 (21.0%), intramural hematoma in 9 (3.9%), penetrating aortic ulcer in 3 (1.3%) and other in 3 (1.3%). Emergency/urgent surgery was performed in 68 cases (29.2%). Operative mortality was 7.3% (17/233). Re-exploration for bleeding and neurologic deficits occurred in 24 (10.3%) and 21 (9.0%) patients respectively. All operative survivors were followed (100%, 216/216) and CT follow-up was available in 81.9% (177/216) for a mean duration of 2.4 years (median 0.6; 25-75% IQR 0.2-3.6 years). Anastomotic pseudoaneurysm was detected in 1 patient (0.6%) at 3 years postoperatively. This was an elderly female with extremely frail tissues who underwent a reoperative ascending and arch replacement for dissection. The use of BioGlue in thoracic aortic surgery was not associated with excess incidence of anastomotic pseudoaneurysm formation following surgical repair of thoracic aortic disease. Its use need not be discouraged on this basis."

    "abstract": "Clostridium septicum-infected aortic aneurysm is a fatal and rare disease. We present a fatal case of C. septicum-infected aortic aneurysm and a pertinent literature review with treatment suggestions for reducing mortality rates. A 58-year-old Japanese man with an unremarkable medical history presented with a 3-day history of mild weakness in both legs, and experienced paraplegia and paresthesia a day before admission. Upon recognition of signs of an abdominal aortic aneurysm and paraplegia, we suspected an occluded Adamkiewicz artery and performed a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan, which revealed an aortic aneurysm with periaortic gas extending from his chest to his abdomen and both kidneys. Antibiotics were initiated followed by emergency surgery for source control of the infection. However, owing to his poor condition and septic shock, aortic repair was not possible. We performed bilateral nephrectomy as a possible source control, after which we initiated mechanical ventilation, continuous hemodialysis, and hemoperfusion. A culture of the samples taken from the infected region and four consecutive blood cultures yielded C. septicum. His condition gradually improved postoperatively; however, on postoperative day 10, massive hemorrhage due to aortic rupture resulted in his death. In this patient, C. septicum was thought to have entered his blood through a gastrointestinal tumor, infected the aorta, and spread to his kidneys. However, we were uncertain whether there was an associated malignancy. A literature review of C. septicum-related aneurysms revealed the following: 6-month mortality, 79.5%; periaortic gas present in 92.6% of cases; no standard operative procedure and no guidelines for antimicrobial administration established; and C. septicum was associated with cancer in 82.5% of cases. Thus, we advocate for early diagnosis via the identification of periaortic gas, as an aortic aneurysm progresses rapidly. To reduce the risk of reinfection as well as infection of other sites, there is the need for concurrent surgical management of the aneurysm and any associated malignancy. We recommend debridement of the infectious focus and in situ vascular graft with omental coverage. Postoperatively, orally administered antibiotics must be continued indefinitely (chronic suppression therapy). We believe that these treatments will decrease mortality due to C. septicum-infected aortic aneurysms."

    "abstract": "Pleuritic chest pain is characterized by sudden and intense sharp, stabbing, or burning pain in the chest when inhaling and exhaling. Pulmonary embolism is the most common serious cause, found in 5% to 21% of patients who present to an emergency department with pleuritic chest pain. A validated clinical decision rule for pulmonary embolism should be employed to guide the use of additional tests such as d-dimer assays, ventilation-perfusion scans, or computed tomography angiography. Myocardial infarction, pericarditis, aortic dissection, pneumonia, and pneumothorax are other serious causes that should be ruled out using history and physical examination, electrocardiography, troponin assays, and chest radiography before another diagnosis is made. Validated clinical decision rules are available to help exclude coronary artery disease. Viruses are common causative agents of pleuritic chest pain. Coxsackieviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, parainfluenza, mumps, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus are likely pathogens. Treatment is guided by the underlying diagnosis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are appropriate for pain management in those with virally triggered or nonspecific pleuritic chest pain. In patients with persistent symptoms, persons who smoke, and those older than 50 years with pneumonia, it is important to document radiographic resolution with repeat chest radiography six weeks after initial treatment."

He was suffering from severe excruciating chest pain that had started after a psychological stress, leading to heavy cocaine abuse. He was admitted to the emergency department of the hospital, and was then transferred to the cardiac care unit to control the chest pain. The patient underwent emergent surgery. After induction of anesthesia, tranesophageal echocardiography probe was introduced gently and a full exam was done. The surgeon decided to perform a classic Bentall procedure. Cardiopulmonary bypass was started. Everything was acceptable, but bleeding was uncontrolled. The surgical team could not control the bleeding, and he passed away due to bleeding. This case report stresses the use of IOTEE as a means for more accurate diagnosis of the lesion under general anesthesia, especially when there is not time to do preoperative TEE, or when bedside echocardiography does not give us adequate data."

Cerebral ischemic complications occur in 18-30% of aortic dissections and patients may present to the emergency department (ED) with isolated focal neurology and no chest pain. In AAD patients, presenting with stroke and subsequently thrombolized, a 71% mortality rate has been reported in patients receiving recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-TPA). We present a case of a 58-year-old male patient that presented to ED with sudden onset of headache and left-sided hemiparesis, computed tomography (CT) demonstrated an ischemic stroke of the right middle cerebral artery. When the question of whether to start r-TPA or mechanical thrombectomy was discussed, a cardiac point-of-care ultrasound was performed in ED and showed a type A aortic dissection; immediately a CT aortic angiogram was performed and confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was taken to theater and had a favorable outcome. <Learning objective: Acute aortic dissection (AAD) may present as acute ischemic stroke with no chest pain.

Compared to patients who underwent the David I procedure for any reason other than AADA, there were no significant differences in long-term survival rates ( P  = 0.29) and freedom from a valve-related reoperation ( P  = 0.39). The valve-sparing David I procedure has acceptable long-term results even in emergent operations for AADA and is not inferior when performed in elective settings."

    "title": "Malperfusion in Type A Dissection: Consider Reperfusion First.",
    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a vascular catastrophe, with a mortality of 1% per hour for the first 48 hours without surgical intervention. Of the diverse causes of morbidity and mortality associated with ATAAD, malperfusion, which complicates 20%-50% of cases, is particularly lethal. Although malperfusion can affect any vascular bed, this review focuses on the 3 most devastating: coronary, cerebral, and visceral malperfusion syndromes (MPS). Essentially, there are 3 methods of restoring flow to malperfused areas: central repair, fenestration, and direct revascularization of affected arteries. Of these, emergency central aortic repair is the accepted primary strategy, as it most expeditiously eliminates the risk of rupture, and accordingly, our protocol is to transfer ATAAD cases directly to the operating room. However, central repair is not necessarily the most expedient strategy for resolving malperfusion, and in some cases, malperfusion persists despite central repair. At some point, with certain cases of severe malperfusion, the mortality from end organ damage exceeds the mortality risk of rupture and recent reports suggest that these cases may be best managed by emergency reperfusion of the affected vascular bed, followed by central repair."

    "abstract": "To evaluate the applicability of an off-the-shelf scalloped stent-graft to preserve left subclavian artery (LSA) flow in thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for acute type B aortic dissection. The computed tomography angiograms (CTA) of 70 consecutive patients (median age 64 years; 44 men) with acute Stanford type B aortic dissection were retrospectively analyzed to identify patients in whom a short proximal landing zone (<15 mm from the retrogradely dissected wall layers) would require LSA overstenting during TEVAR. A scalloped stent-graft was deemed possible in those patients with the intimal entry tear located at least 20 mm distant from the LSA ostium. The LSA needed to be covered in 56 (80%) patients. Of these, an off-the-shelf scalloped stent-graft would have been applicable in 23 (41%) patients. In the latter group, the median aortic diameter was 31 mm (range 26-37), the median length of the LSA ostium was 13 mm (range 10-20), and the median width of the LSA ostium was 15 mm (range 11-24). Three differently sized off-the-shelf stent-grafts with the largest scallop possible could have adequately treated 20 (36%) of the 56 patients in the acute phase. In this single-center imaging-based study, involvement of the LSA in the setting of acute type B aortic dissection was seen in 80% of patients treated with TEVAR. Three off-the-shelf stent-grafts would suffice to treat one-third of these acute type B aortic dissections and may offer a relatively simple solution to preserve LSA flow, thereby lowering the risk of malperfusion of the (posterior) cerebrum, spinal cord, and left arm in an urgent/emergent setting."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is diagnostically challenging, especially in pain-free patients. Detection of acute ischemic stroke secondary to painless aortic dissection is a challenge for emergency physicians and neurologists. We report a previously healthy 58-years old female, admitted because of nausea, dizziness, somnolence, a left-sided hemiparesis and arterial hypotension. The electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with ST-elevations and ST-depressions. Perfusion CT-imaging showed a dilatation of the aortic arch and intraluminal structures indicating an intima flap of aortic dissection. Four hours after onset of symptoms the patient died on the way to the cardiac surgery. In conclusion, apart from imaging the aortic arch by computed tomography in acute stroke patients, the electrocardiogram may be indicative for aortic dissection if it shows signs for myocardial ischemia in previously healthy patients."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Type A AAD, a serious cardiovascular emergency requiring urgent surgery, is the most common and serious AAD. The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic value of ADAMTS1 and ADAMTS4 in patients with type A acute aortic dissection (AAD). MATERIAL AND METHODS Immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR were used to evaluate the protein and mRNA expression levels of ADAMTS1 and ADAMTS4 in 14 type A acute aortic dissection (AAD) tissues and 10 control aortic tissues. Serum ADAMTS1 and ADAMTS4 expression levels in 74 patients with type A AAD, 36 patients with hypertension (HPT), and 34 healthy donors were examined by ELISA. The diagnostic value of serum ADAMTS1 and ADAMTS4 were determined by receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC). Furthermore, the dynamic change of serum ADAMTS1, ADAMTS4, D-dimer, and CRP were detected before and after surgery at different time-points in 14 patients with type A AAD. RESULTS ADAMTS1 and ADAMTS4 protein and mRNA expression levels were found to be significantly higher in 14 type A AAD tissues (p<0.0001) compared with 10 control tissues. Serum ADAMTS1 and ADAMTS4 levels were significant higher in patients with type A AAD than those in the HPT and HD group (p<0.0001 for both). The AUC value, sensitivity, and specificity of ADAMTS1 were 0.9710 (95% CI: 0.9429 to 0.9991), 87.84%, and 97.06%, respectively, and those of ADAMTS4 were 0.9893 (95% CI: 0.9765 to 1.002), 94.59%, and 97.06%, respectively. In addition, serum ADAMTS4 level was gradually decreased with the time extension after surgery, similar to D-dimer change. CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that measurement of serum ADAMTS1 and ADAMTS4 levels could be potential diagnostic biomarkers for type A AAD, and ADAMTS4 might be a risk factor associated with type A AAD."

A 60-year-old man developed sudden left hemiparesis due to IS. During tPA infusion, his blood pressure dropped and consciousness declined. After transfer to our hospital, carotid duplex ultrasonography led to a diagnosis of AD. Emergency surgery was postponed because of the risk of hemorrhagic transformation.

    "abstract": "Over the past 3 decades, the standard surgical management for acute DeBakey type I aortic dissection has not significantly changed. Most patients undergo ascending aortic replacement with an interposition graft under hypothermic circulatory arrest with selective root replacement. Nevertheless, with the improvement in overall patient care, acute surgical outcomes continue to improve. The frozen elephant trunk (FET) technique was introduced as a modification to conventional elephant trunk to treat extensive degenerative and chronic dissecting aneurysms involving the aortic arch and the proximal descending aorta. The FET technique converts the conventional elephant trunk procedure-an inherently 2-stage operation-into a 1-stage repair in selected patients and greatly facilitates more distal aortic repair, for others. The surgical strategy is tailored to address individual pathology, based on each patient's aortic anatomy and disease. FET technique in acute DeBakey type I aortic dissection extends the surgical repair into and beyond the arch with the potential to address some of the limitations of the conventional type I aortic dissection repair, but it has not been widely adopted yet. Only a limited number of institutions have embraced this modality during the acute phase of aortic dissection out of concern that it may be too complicated during an emergency situation. We have developed a simplified technique that has evolved over the past several years and the purpose of this report is to describe it."

    "abstract": "Emergency medicine is a 'high risk' specialty. Some diseases develop suddenly and progress rapidly, and sudden unexpected deaths in the emergency department (ED) may cause medical disputes. We aimed to assess discrepancies between antemortem clinical diagnoses and postmortem autopsy findings concerning emergency medicine dispute cases and to figure out the most common major missed diagnoses. Clinical files and autopsy reports were retrospectively analysed and interpreted. Discrepancies between clinical diagnoses and autopsy diagnoses were evaluated using modified Goldman classification as major and minor discrepancy. The difference between diagnosis groups was compared with Pearson χ2 test. Of the 117 cases included in this study, 71 of cases (58 class I and 13 class II diagnostic errors) were revealed as major discrepancies (60.7%). The most common major diagnoses were cardiovascular diseases (54 cases), followed by pulmonary diseases, infectious diseases and so on. The difference of major discrepancy between the diagnoses groups was significant (p<0.001). Aortic dissection and myocardial infarction were the most common cause of death (15 cases for each disease) and the most common missed class I diagnoses (80% and 66.7% for each), higher than the average 49.6% of all class I errors of the study patients. High major disparities between clinical diagnoses and postmortem examinations exist in emergency medical disputes cases; acute aortic dissection and myocardial infarction are the most frequently major missed diagnoses that ED clinicians should pay special attention to in practice. This study reaffirmed the necessity and usefulness of autopsy in auditing death in EDs."

Cardiologists immediately gave the patient conservative management. At the same time, another smaller stent was immediately embedded in the proximal area of the right coronary artery and plunged into the ascending aorta by 2 mm, with the intention of covering the tear of the dissection. Repeated coronary angiography showed that a 40% stricture of the distal right coronary artery remained and less contrast agent had been extravasated. The patient was then transferred to the Department of Cardiac Surgery and received emergency surgery consisting of right coronary artery bypass grafting and ascending aorta replacement. The patient remained in the intensive care unit for 18 days after the surgery.

Acute aortic dissection (AD) is an uncommon but fatal cardiovascular disease. In this study, we investigated both prognostic factors in patients with AD and whether NLR can be a predictor for mortality. Methods: We analyzed retrospectively the data of 57 patients with AD who had undergone emergent surgery in our hospital and included 128 consecutive patients with chest pain admitted to the emergency room as a control group. Also, patients who were operated on due to aortic dissection as another subgroup were compared to NLR values. Baseline clinical features, cardiovascular risk factors, and surgical and laboratory parameters were obtained from the hospital database. Results: Patients with AD had higher NLR than the control group (1.7 ± 0.5 versus 7.6 ± 3.3, P < .001). In the AD group, 15 deaths occurred and non-survivors had significantly higher NLR, compared to survivors (11.6 ± 2.4 versus 6.6 ± 2.3, P < .001). In multivariate analysis, high NLR (odds ratio [OR] 1.913, 95% CI 1.030-1.081, P = .04) and cross-clamp time (OR 1.265, 95% CI 1.003-1.596, P = .04) were determined as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. In receiver operating characteristics curve analyses, the NLR > 9.3 predicted the mortality in AD with a specificity of 91% and a sensitivity of 86% (P < .001). This study shows that high NLR can be used as a marker for prognosis in short-term mortality of patient with AD. Additionally, increased lactate level in perioperative period, prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time, and additional cardiac procedures are strong independent predictors of short-term mortality in patients with acute AD."

This review evaluates vascular causes of syncope and their evaluation and management in the ED. Syncope is defined by a brief loss of consciousness with loss of postural tone and complete, spontaneous recovery without medical intervention. Causes include cardiac, vasovagal, orthostatic, neurologic, medication-related, and idiopathic, and most cases of syncope will not receive a specific diagnosis pertaining to the cause. Emergency physicians are most concerned with life-threatening causes such as dysrhythmia and obstruction, and electrocardiogram is a primary means of evaluation. However, vascular etiologies can result in patient morbidity and mortality. These conditions include pulmonary embolism, subclavian steal, aortic dissection, cerebrovascular disease, intracerebral hemorrhage, carotid/vertebral dissection, and abdominal aortic aneurysm. A focused history and physical examination can assist emergency physicians in determining the need for further testing and management. Syncope is common and may be the result of a deadly condition. The emergency physician, through history and physical examination, can determine the need for further evaluation and resuscitation of these patients, with consideration of vascular etiologies of syncope."

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prognostic role of BUN in patients with acute aortic dissection (AAD). BUN has correlation with in-hospital mortality of patients with AAD. Patients admitted to the emergency room within the first 24 h of onset of AAD were included in the study. BUN levels were measured on admission and the endpoints were mortality during hospi-talization after receiving surgical or endovascular repair. A total of 192 patients with AAD were enrolled. During hospitalization, 19 patients died and 173 patients survived. Increased levels of BUN (8.9 [7.0-9.7] vs. 6.0 [5.1-7.2] mmol/L, p < 0.001) were found in non-survivors compared with those survived. Using multivariable logistic analysis, BUN was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality in patients with AAD (OR 1.415, 95% CI 1.016-1.971, p = 0.040). Furthermore, using receiver operating characteristic analysis, the optimal cutoff value for BUN was 6.95 mmol/L. Under this value, the area under the curve was 0.785 (95% CI 0.662-0.909, p < 0.001) and the sensitivity and specificity to predict in-hospital mortality was 78.9%, and 72.2%, respectively.

However, in a subset of patients, aortic dissections go undiagnosed and become chronic, thereby allowing the dissected wall to undergo a distinct remodeling process from that of the surrounding intact wall. Here, we observe the biomechanical and histological changes in the aortic wall of two patients with chronic Type A aortic dissection. Partial or complete disruption of the elastic structure of the medial layer was observed in the dissected wall of both patients; however, aortic stiffness in the region of dissection covaried with a change in collagen content. A ~50% increase in viscous energy loss was observed in the region of dissection of both patients which suggests an impaired elastic recoil and Windkessel function of the proximal aorta. MMP expression (2 and 9) differed between the dissected and intact wall and was distinct between the two patients. Our observations suggest that an active remodeling process occurs in the dissected aortic wall resulting in a vastly different biomechanical behavior."

Non-A non-B dissection was classified as descending-entry type with entry distal to the left subclavian artery and dissection extending into the aortic arch, and arch-entry type with entry between the innominate and left subclavian arteries. We compared these 2 groups' clinical presentation, treatment and outcome. Among 396 acute aortic dissection patients, 43 (median age 60 ± 12 years, 81% males) had non-A non-B dissection (descending-entry n = 21, arch-entry n = 22). The overwhelming majority of aortic segments were not dilated in all these patients. The 2 groups' cardiovascular risk profiles did not differ. Emergency open or endovascular aortic repair were necessary due to malperfusion or aortic rupture in 29% descending-entry and 36% arch-entry (in-hospital mortality was 1/6 and 3/8, respectively). Aortic repair within 2 weeks due to new organ malperfusion, rapid aortic growth, aortic rupture or persisting pain was performed in 43% descending-entry and 36% arch-entry patients (0% in-hospital mortality). All others (except for 1 diagnosed in 2014) required aortic repair for aneurysm at follow-up. Acute non-A non-B aortic dissection frequently requires emergency aortic repair due to organ malperfusion or aortic rupture. Most descending-entry and arch-entry non-A non-B dissection patients undergo aortic repair within 2 weeks after dissection onset."

Aortic dissections require rapid diagnosis and surgical treatment; thus, in order to optimize patient outcomes, clinicians must be accessible, data must be readily available, and proper prompts and notifications must be made to alert and ready teams. An interdisciplinary team reviewed our hospital's processes and architecture of systems to define how we provide care during aortic emergencies. Based on this insight into patient flow, we ultimately developed a Code Aorta protocol to streamline provision of care during aortic emergencies. This process focused on protocol development, human-technology interfaces, and outcome-oriented metrics. The team also aimed to heighten awareness of the emergent process and to understand relevant outcomes data. After introduction of the Code Aorta protocol, a 78% reduction was achieved in time-to-treatment from the previous year's average time. In addition, the average length of stay was reduced by 2.4 days (18%). The team's efforts focused on clinical communication, aiming to link technology to maximize clinical efficiency. The initial results of our Code Aorta protocol show promise that continual refinement of patient care processes during aortic emergencies will improve outcomes for patients suffering aortic dissection."

Indications for ECMO were failure to be withdrawn from cardiopulmonary bypass or refractory cardiogenic shock occurring during postoperative Days 1 and 2. Patients' characteristics and outcomes were prospectively collected in a local ECMO database. Ninety-two patients, median age of 63 years (17-83 years), were supported by ECMO following valvular surgery (66%), acute aortic dissection (10%) and coronary artery bypass grafting (9%). A total of 37% were combined surgical procedures, 24% were redo procedures and 33% were emergent procedures. The median duration of ECMO support was 6 days (1-28 days).

There was a trend for lower serum creatinine levels and total bilirubin rates in the survivors' group 24 h after initiation of ECMO (respectively, 162 vs 212 µmol/l, P = 0.06; 25.3 vs 54.2 mg/dl, P = 0.08). Valvular surgery and peak lactic acid serum level were associated with poor outcomes. The mean health-related quality of life EuroQoL scale was 68 ± 16/100 at 2 years. Refractory cardiogenic shock requiring ECMO was most frequently observed after redo valvular surgery in the present study. The overall 6-month survival rate was 39% after ECMO support for post-cardiotomy cardiogenic shock with acceptable health-related quality of life. Improved kidney and liver functions after 24 h of support were associated with favourable outcomes."

    "abstract": "The first publication of Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) described aortic rupture at young ages. Experience with new LDS types showed that the clinical course varies, and thresholds for prophylactic surgery are discussed. As this is an uncommon disease, experience needs to be shared. Retrospective review of patients with LDS types 1-4 undergoing cardiovascular surgery during the years 1991-2016. Thirty-five patients (including 6 children with LDS2) underwent 57 operations. LDS 1, 2, 3 and 4 included 4, 17, 11 and 3 patients, respectively. Mean age at first surgery was 36 years, with a non-significant trend that LDS2 patients were younger. Of the 9 emergency surgeries, 7 were type A dissections, with 1 postoperative death. Twenty-two patients had prophylactic aortic root surgery (17 valve-sparing root replacements), with 1 postoperative death, 1 reoperation with valve replacement and 1 late death. Freedom from root reintervention and death was 92% at 13 years. Of the 11 patients with LDS3, 5 needed mitral valve surgery. Mitral valve disease was not found in the other LDS types. Ten patients needed >1 operation. Of the 57 operations, 33 were in the ascending aorta, 20 in the aorta distal to the arch including branches and 4 were isolated heart surgeries. Of the 20 vascular operations, 16 were in LDS2. Cumulative survival 20 years after first surgery (all patients) was 94.3%. Clinical course seems to be more aggressive in LDS2, with index operation at a younger age, and higher risk of needing several operations. Vascular disease distal to the arch is not uncommon. LDS3 seems to be associated with mitral valve disease. Prophylactic aortic root surgery is safe and durable."

    "title": "Clinical Implications of Electrocardiograms for Patients With Type A Acute Aortic Dissection.",
    "abstract": "Type A acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a serious cardiovascular emergency requiring urgent surgery. Timely accurate diagnosis is essential, but often challenging, because of the wide spectrum of clinical presentations. In patients with type A AAD, chest pain is the most common symptom; furthermore, ischemic ST-T changes such as ST-segment elevation or depression or negative T waves are frequently observed on presentation ECG. These clinical presentations of type A AAD are difficult to differentiate from those of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which could lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment of type A AAD or misdiagnosis of ACS followed by inappropriate treatment. Of note, ischemic ST-T changes have been shown to be associated with poor outcomes in patients with type A AAD. Because ECG is simple, inexpensive, noninvasive, readily available, and rapidly interpretable at the time of presentation, risk stratification based on ECG findings is considered very useful clinically. ECG findings of type A AAD thus have clinically important diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic implications; however, the relationships among these factors remain poorly understood. We review the prevalence of ECG abnormalities, clinical features associated with such changes, and the prognostic importance in patients with type A AAD."

The study included 330 patients with TAAD repaired using TAR + FET between January 2014 and April 2015. Mean age was 47.1±10.2 years (range, 18-73 years) and 242 were male (73.3%). Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify the risk factors for CRRT. Postoperative CRRT was required in 38 patients (mean age 50.7±10.0 years; 27 males). Operative death occurred in 12 patients (3.6%, 12/330). The mortality rate was 23.7% (9/38) in patients with CRRT and 1.0% (3/292) in those without CRRT (P<0.001). Factors associated with CRRT were age (50.7±10.0 vs. 46.7±10.2 years, P=0.023), preoperative serum creatinine (sCr) (135.0±154.2 vs. 85.7±37.0 µmol/L, P<0.001), emergency operation (89.5% vs. 73.3%, P=0.030), cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time (265.2±98.8 vs. 199.7±44.2 minutes, P<0.001), cross-clamp time (144.6±54.8 vs. 116.3±33.2 minutes, P<0.001), the amount of red blood cell (8.0±5.2 vs. 3.7±3.3 unit, P<0.001) and fresh frozen plasma (507.8±350.3 vs. 784.2±488.5 mL, P<0.001) transfused intraoperatively, preoperative D-dimmer level (11,361.0 vs. 2,856.7 mg/L, P<0.001) and reexploration for bleeding (15.8% vs. 2.4%, P<0.001).

    "abstract": "We describe a case of hemolytic anemia and proximal anastomotic site stenosis following emergency repair of a Type A aortic dissection. This rare complication led to a reoperation to correct the iatrogenic aortic stenosis and cure the consequent hemolysis. A \"sandwich\" technique (with two Teflon strips on the outside and inside of the aortic wall) was used in the initial repair to reinforce the suture line and prevent bleeding from the aortic anastomoses. At the time of reoperation, the inner Teflon strip at the proximal aortic anastomosis was found to have inverted into the aortic lumen, as suggested by the preoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Surgical treatment consisted of resecting the portion of inner Teflon that had turned in and tacking the remaining part back onto the aortic wall. The observed hemolysis was likely due to the turbulent flow associated with the supra-aortic stenosis and the collision of red cells with the internal Teflon strip. The patient made an uncomplicated recovery with no further hemolysis and was discharged on postoperative day 8."

The records were reviewed for patients admitted to the large comprehensive university hospital for PCI due to STEMI from January 1, 2002 to January 1, 2017. The incidence of STEMI secondary to TAAD in our center was 0.51% (8/1,576). A total of 5 patients underwent urgent coronary angiography (CAG) without awareness of TAAD. Compression at the ostium of right coronary artery (RCA) was found in 2 patients, dissected flap of RCA in 1 patient, and heterogeneous filling and false lumen in RCA in 1 patient. Three of these 5 patients received surgery and survived. One patient accepted urgent RCA stenting because of cardiogenic shock and died after refusal of surgical therapy and failure of medical treatment. Another 2 patients received thrombolytic therapy died prior to CAG. Thus, the total in-hospital mortality was 37.5% (3/8). TAAD presenting as STEMI was a rare condition that predominantly involved RCA. A quick and correct clinical diagnosis of STEMI caused by TAAD prior to invasive procedure would be important. Urgent CAG without awareness of TAAD could provide important information for a timely diagnosis. High level of suspicion and awareness is the key to establishing the diagnosis and achieving optimal clinical outcome."

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to summarize our initial experience using the double chimney technique to treat aortic arch diseases. From December 2009 to October 2016, 23 patients with aortic arch diseases, including 20 acute aortic dissections, 2 aortic arch aneurysms, and 1 type I endoleak after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), were treated using a double chimney technique. An emergent operation was performed in only one patient with an acute aortic dissection for severe left lower extremity ischemia. All patients were observed after TEVAR with computed tomography scans at 2 weeks, at 3 and 6 months, and annually thereafter. In all patients, aortic arch lesions were covered, and supra-aortic branches were patent without morbidity. In 22 patients, the innominate artery (IA) and left common carotid artery were reconstructed with the proximal landing zone in zone 0; in 1 patient, the left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery were reconstructed. During the procedure, there were three (13.0%) type I endoleaks. Chimney stent graft migration occurred in one (4.3%) patient perioperatively; compression of a chimney stent graft occurred in one (4.3%) patient 4 days after TEVAR. There were no type II endoleaks or perioperative mortality. Median follow-up was 28.0 ± 19.8 (range, 3-84) months, with no TEVAR-related deaths. Partial compression of the chimney stent graft in the IA occurred at 3 months after TEVAR in one (4.3%) patient; three patients had persistent but asymptomatic type I endoleaks. TEVAR using a double chimney technique to reconstruct the supra-aortic branches provides a safe and minimally invasive alternative procedure associated with low postoperative mortality. The main perioperative complications include type I endoleak and compression of the chimney stent grafts in the IA. More experience with long-term results is needed to evaluate the effectiveness and durability of this advanced endovascular procedure."

Systemic perfusion was started via the femoral artery, but another dissection appeared in the descending aorta detected by transoesophageal echocardiography. However, the flap was unusually thin, and there was no change in the pre-existing thrombosed false lumen. These findings suggested subintimal development of dissection. After systemic perfusion was promptly switched to antegrade perfusion, the new dissection could no longer be detected. Since there was no malperfusion or aortic rupture, the ascending aorta was repaired. His postoperative course was uneventful, and there were no significant complications. Unless the aorta is carefully observed at the right time during the operation, such vanishing aortic dissection may be missed and potentially result in 'organ damage of unknown cause'."

    "abstract": "Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm type 3 (TAAA3) is a challenging disease to vascular surgeons. In these cases, the best treatment methodology is conventional surgery, which portends a mortality rate ranging from 8% to 25%. Endovascular treatment has been shown to be a good alternative, with encouraging results. In 2012, a new alternative for endovascular treatment of TAAA3 was presented: Cook T-Branch endoprosthesis (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Indiana). We present the first successful case of endovascular treatment of a ruptured TAAA3 with this stent. A 68-year-old was admitted to the emergency department with epigastric pain, radiating to the back without improvement with opioids. Physical examination revealed an epigastric pulsatile mass without evidence of peritonitis or blows. The patient was known to have a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. A computed tomography angiography showed growth of the abdominal aneurysm, accompanied with signs of rupture (fat blurring in the posterior region of TAAA3). The patient was submitted to endovascular repair of a ruptured TAAA3 in a hybrid operating room using a 34 × 18 × 202 mm T-Branch graft. It was an uneventful 330-min procedure under general anesthesia. Immediate postoperative period had no cardiovascular events. Evolution showed excellent distal perfusion and complete pain relief. Until now, the only endovascular alternative for ruptured aortic aneurysm was the parallel prosthesis technique. The development of an off-the-shelf T-Branch prosthesis (Cook Medical) has solved this problem in many cases, enabling immediate treatment of this type of aneurysm in approximately 83% of patients. The fact that the thoracic aorta would be excluded lead the patient to a high risk of spinal cord ischemia. We therefore decided to make a cerebrospinal fluid drainage. There is no consensus regarding the best devices to be used as branches. In this case, we chose to use the previously described covered stents, according to its flexibility and compatibility with the length of arteries. This is the first report of the use of a T-branch (Cook Medical) for treatment of a ruptured TAAA3. The development of an off-the-shelf endoprosthesis has many advantages: it is available for use in an emergency situation, and there is no time lapse for its preparation. The T-Branch stent graft is a valid option for the treatment of ruptured TAAA3."

Chest X-ray revealed widening of the mediastinum. Subsequently, contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography demonstrated Stanford type A aortic dissection.

    "abstract": "Background Acute aortic dissection (AD) is a life-threatening medical emergency. It has been debated whether the multiphase dynamic computed tomography angiography (CTA) protocol is superior to the standard triphasic protocol for revealing the characteristics of AD. Purpose To examine two multiphase dynamic protocols, Dynamic four-dimensional (4D) CTA using the shuttle mode and Flash 4D CTA using the high-pitch mode for the assessment of AD and to compare them with the standard triphasic protocol. Material and Methods A total of 54 consecutive patients were randomly and equally assigned to three groups and scanned with a second-generation DSCT scanner. Groups A, B, and C were assessed with the Dynamic 4D CTA in the shuttle mode, the Flash 4D CTA in the high-pitch mode, and the standard triphasic acquisition protocol, respectively. Image quality of all patients was evaluated. The effective radiation dose (ED) was recorded. Results In 54 patients, CTA images could display the true and false lumens, the intimal flap, the entry tear, and branch vessel involvement in the AD. Compared with group C, additional diagnostic information was obtained in groups A and B, including the dynamic enhancement delay between the true and false lumens (A = 18, B = 18); the presence of membrane oscillation (A = 8, B = 14); dynamic ejection of the contrast material from the true lumen into the false lumen (A = 6, B = 7); and the dynamic obstruction of the left renal artery (B = 2). The ED in these three groups was significantly different ( P < 0.05). Conclusion Compared to the standard triphasic protocol, the multiphase dynamic CTA protocol is feasible and is able to reveal additional diagnostic information. Therefore, we recommend using the high-pitch, dual-source multiphase dynamic CTA to assess ADs."

    "abstract": "There are no comprehensive guidelines on management of hypertensive emergency (HTNE) and complications. Despite advances in antihypertensive medications HTNE is accompanied with significant morbidity and mortality. We queried the 2002-2012 nationwide inpatient sample database to identify patients with HTNE. Trends in incidence of HTNE and in-hospital mortality were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between end-organ complications and in-hospital mortality. Between 2002 and 2012, 129,914 admissions were included. Six hundred and thirty (0.48%) patients died during their hospital stay. There was an increase in the number of HTNE admissions (9,511-15,479; Ptrend < 0.001) with concurrent reduction of in-hospital mortality (0.8-0.3%; Ptrend < 0.001) by the year 2012 compared to 2002. Patients who died during hospitalization were older, had longer length of stay, higher cost of stay, more comorbidities, and higher risk scores. Presence of acute cardiorespiratory failure [adjusted odds ratio (OR), 15.8; 95% confidence interval (CI), 13.2-18.9], stroke or transient ischemia attack (TIA) (adjusted OR, 7.9; 95% CI, 6.3-9.9), chest pain (adjusted OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 4.4-7.7), stroke/TIA (adjusted OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 4.5-7.7), and aortic dissection (adjusted OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 2.8-12.4) were most predictive of higher in-hospital mortality in addition to factors such as age, aortic dissection, acute myocardial infarction, acute renal failure, and presence of neurological symptoms. A rising trend in hospitalization for HTNE, with an overall decrease in in-hospital mortality was observed from 2002 to 2012, possibly related to changes in coding practices and improved management. Presence of acute cardiorespiratory failure, stroke/TIA, chest pain, and aortic dissection were most predictive of higher hospital mortality."

We recruited 174 ED patients who underwent high-pitch CTA of the aorta because of suspected aortic dissection. We divided these patients into two groups (diseased and control groups) based on whether their clinical data fulfilled the third universal definition of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), specifically an increase in cardiac troponin (cTn) with at least one of the following: (a) symptoms of ischemia; (b) new ST-segment-T wave (ST-T) changes or new left bundle branch block (LBBB); (c) development of pathological Q wave; (d) new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality; or (e) identification of an intracoronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy. Twenty-two patients with a clinical diagnosis of AMI were placed in the diseased group. Myocardial perfusion defects were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively on the late arterial phase obtained 50 s post-threshold. Of the 22 patients with a final diagnosis of AMI, visually identifiable perfusion defects were observed in 12 patients. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of any perfusion defect for predicting AMI were 54.6%, 94.7%, 93.5%, and 60.0%, respectively. Quantitative analysis indicated that CT attenuation was significantly lower within perfusion defects than within the normal myocardium (67.6 ± 29.5 HU vs. 92.2 ± 19.7 HU; p < 0.001). In patients with acute chest pain, the presence of myocardial perfusion defect observed on nongated high-pitch CTA of the aorta can be used to identify individuals with AMI with high specificity, but low sensitivity."

    "abstract": "The aims of this study are to evaluate the outcomes and trends of contemporary emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection on the basis of a systematic approach and to assess the impact of temporary aortic crossclamping during systemic cooling on early and late outcomes. We retrospectively reviewed 702 consecutive patients who underwent emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection between March 2004 and May 2015. Our clinical protocol includes rapid transfer to the operating room, quick establishment of cardiopulmonary bypass, temporary aortic crossclamping during cooling, primary entry resection, and open distal anastomosis. We analyzed the perioperative data, survival, freedom from aortic reinterventions, and impact of aortic crossclamping on early and late outcomes. The median time from hospital arrival to cardiopulmonary bypass establishment was 115 minutes and has decreased over the last decade (trend test P < .001). We perfused the femoral artery in 615 patients (87.6%), placed aortic crossclamping in 616 patients (87.7%), and performed open distal anastomosis in all patients. The operative mortality was 5.4% (38/702), and the incidence of stroke was 10.8% (76/702). The 7-year overall survival and freedom from aortic reinterventions were 80.4% and 87.5%, respectively. Compared with the nonclamping group, the crossclamping group had a shorter operation time, similar operative mortality, incidence of stroke, and freedom from aortic reinterventions. Emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection based on our systematic approach demonstrated excellent early and late outcomes. The temporary aortic crossclamping during cooling decreased the operation time without increasing early and late adverse events."

    "abstract": "Emergency treatment of complex aortic pathology is challenging in the setting of a right-sided aortic arch. We report the successful treatment of a ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) in the setting of a Stanford type B aortic dissection (TBAD) and right-sided aortic arch. The patient is a 66-year-old male with chronic kidney disease (CKD) admitted with right sided chest pain and hypotension. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed a 5cm ruptured TAA in the setting of a TBAD and right-sided aortic arch. The TBAD began just distal to the right common carotid artery and involved the origin of the left subclavian artery (SCA). Using a totally percutaneous approach, a conformable Gore® TAG® thoracic endoprosthesis was placed in proximal descending thoracic aorta covering the left SCA. Aside from progression of his pre-existing CKD, the patient had an uneventful recovery. CTA one-month post-procedure revealed a type IB endoleak with degeneration of the distal descending thoracic aorta. To exclude the endoleak, the repair was extended distally using a Medtronic Valiant® thoracic stent graft. The left subclavian artery was subsequently coil embolized to treat an additional retrograde endoleak. The patient has done well with no further evidence of endoleak or aneurysm expansion. Right-sided aortic arch presents challenges in the emergency setting. CTA and post-processing reconstructions are very helpful. While the endoleaks prompted additional interventions, the end result was excellent. This case displays the importance of careful attention to detail and follow-up in these complicated patients."

This study compared the anatomic and clinical factors for patients with MCAD who underwent TEVAR with or without full true lumen (TL) collapse. From January 2012 to March 2016, 54 of 644 consecutive type B AD patients (8.4%) who presented with MCAD were reviewed. Patients were classified as MCAD with full TL collapse and without full TL collapse according to computed tomography angiography findings. We analyzed potential variables including clinical characteristics, anatomic morphologic features, and procedural details. Multivariable analysis was performed to determine independent predictors of AD-related deaths. A total of four patients (7.4%) died preoperatively of aortic rupture, all of whom experienced full TL collapse. MCAD patients with full TL collapse showed significantly higher 30-day major adverse events than those without full TL collapse (36.8% vs 9.7%; P = .030). The mean follow-up duration was 25.6 ± 13.2 months (range, 3-53 months). The overall mortality for all MCAD patients was 16.7%, whereas the follow-up major adverse events rate was 40.0% after TEVAR. Significant differences were present between patients with full TL collapse and patients without full TL collapse in survival at 3 years (55.4% vs 94.7%; P = .002). Maximum diameter of affected aorta (hazard ratio, 1.176; 95% confidence interval, 1.015-1.362; P = .031) was identified as the only predictor of AD-related deaths. MCAD was identified in a small but not insignificant number of our patients presenting with type B AD. Urgent or elective TEVAR was indicated in all our patients with MCAD. In patients with MCAD, full TL collapse was associated with worse outcomes, and this finding may indicate the need for more urgent or emergent repair."

From 2002 to 2015, 90 consecutive octogenarians (mean age, 83.5 ± 3 years) were treated for AADA at three institutions: 67 patients underwent surgery, 23 patients received medical treatment. Analysis of early and late outcome was performed. Patients in the medical treatment group were significantly older than in the surgical group (84.9 ± 3.7 vs 83 ± 2.5 years, P  = 0.008) and in a more critical state. In patients undergoing surgical repair, perioperative mortality was 14.9% ( n  = 10). Rate of prolonged ventilation (63.2% vs 5.9%; P  < 0.001) and renal failure (35.1% vs 5.9%, P  = 0.029) was significantly higher in the surgical group. Thirty-day survival was impaired in the medical treatment group (34.8% vs 61.2% in the surgical group; P  = 0.032). Coronary artery disease (OR 3.95, 95% CI 1.16-13.49; P  = 0.029) and complicated dissections (OR 5.28, 95% CI 1.48-18.88; P  = 0.010)-composite variable of preoperative resuscitation, neurological injury and malperfusion-emerged as independent risk factors for 30-day mortality in the surgical group. There was no difference in long-term survival. Emergency surgery for AADA in octogenarians is associated with relatively high intraoperative mortality and may reasonably be avoided in patient with complicated presentation. Despite better immediate survival after surgery, long-term survival does not differ between medical and surgical patients, reflecting the extremely advanced point in life cycle octogenarians."

    "title": "[Late reoperations after repaired Stanford type A aortic dissection].",
    "abstract": "Objective: To summarize the experience of reoperations on patients who had late complications related to previous aortic surgery for Stanford type A dissection. Methods: From August 2008 to October 2016, 14 patients (10 male and 4 female patients) who underwent previous cardiac surgery for Stanford type A aortic dissection accepted reoperations on the late complications at Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Nanjing Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University. The range of age was from 41 to 76 years, the mean age was (57±12) years. In these patients, first time operations were ascending aorta replacement procedure in 3 patients, ascending aorta combined with partial aortic arch replacement in 4 patients, aortic root replacement (Bentall) associated with Marfan syndrome in 3 patients, aortic valve combined with ascending aorta replacement (Wheat) in 1 patient, ascending aorta combined with Sun's procedure in 1 patient, Wheat combined with Sun's procedure in 1 patient, Bentall combined with Sun's procedure in 1 patient. The interval between two operations averaged 0.3 to 10.0 years with a mean of (4.8±3.1) years. The reasons for reoperations included part anastomotic split, aortic valve insufficiency, false aneurysm formation, enlargement of remant aortal and false cavity. The selection of reoperation included anastomotic repair, aortic valve replacement, total arch replacement and Sun's procedure. Results: Of the 14 patients, the cardiopulmonary bypass times were 107 to 409 minutes with a mean of (204±51) minutes, cross clamp times were 60 to 212 minutes with a mean of (108±35) minutes, selective cerebral perfusion times were 16 to 38 minutes with a mean of (21±11) minutes. All patients survived from the operation, one patient died from severe pulmonary infection 50 days after operation. Three patients had postoperative complications, including acute renal failure of 2 patients and pulmonary infection of 1 patient, and these patients were recovered after treatment. Thirteen patients were finally recovered from hospital. The patients were followed up for 16 to 45 months, and no aortic rupture, paraplegia and death were observed in the follow-up. Conclusions: Patients for residual aortic dissection after initial operations on Stanford type A aortic dissection should be attached great importance and always need emergency surgery, but the technique is demanding and risk is great for surgeons and patients, which need enough specification and accurate on aortic operation. More importantly, the Sun's procedure also should be performed on the treatment of residual aortic dissection or distal arch expansion, and obtains the short- and long-term results in the future. 目的： 探讨Stanford A型主动脉夹层再手术治疗的效果。 方法： 回顾性分析2008年8月至2016年10月南京医科大学附属南京医院胸心血管外科施行二次手术的14例Stanford A型主动脉夹层术后发生手术后并发症的患者。男性10例，女性4例；年龄41～76岁，平均(57±12)岁。首次手术为升主动脉替换术3例，升主动脉＋右半弓替换术4例，马方综合征合并夹层行主动脉根部替换术(Bentall手术)3例，主动脉瓣＋升主动脉替换术(Wheat手术)1例，升主动脉替换＋全主动脉弓替换及降主动脉支架象鼻人工血管置入术(孙氏手术)1例，Wheat手术＋孙氏手术1例，Bentall手术＋孙氏手术1例。再手术距首次手术0.3～10.0年，平均(4.8±3.1)年。再手术原因包括吻合口部分裂开、主动脉瓣关闭不全、假性动脉瘤形成、残余主动脉或假腔增粗。再手术术式选择吻合口修补、主动脉瓣置换或孙氏手术。 结果： 14例患者顺利完成手术。心肺转流时间107～409 min，平均(204±51)min；主动脉阻断时间60～212 min，平均(108±35)min；10例行深低温停循环、低流量选择性脑灌注，灌注时间16～38 min，平均(21±11)min。无手术早期死亡，1例患者术后50 d死于肺炎。术后3例发生并发症，其中急性肾功能衰竭2例，肺部感染1例，均于治疗后痊愈。13例患者康复出院。生存患者随访16～45个月，平均(26±12)个月，随访期间无夹层破裂、截瘫和死亡病例。 结论： Stanford A型主动脉夹层术后根部残余夹层或远端弓部扩张的患者应及时手术治疗，手术难度及风险均较初次主动脉夹层手术增加，应注意主动脉操作的规范和准确，尽量施行孙氏手术，可获得满意的短期及长期临床结果。."

    "title": "[Clinical practice and thoughts on the strategy of root reconstruction for Stanford type A aortic dissection].",
    "abstract": "The strategy of root reconstruction for Stanford type A aortic dissection (AAD) includes resection of the intimal tear site, correction of concomitant aortic valve dysfunction and amendment of coronary lesion. Supracommissural tube graft replacement is a well-adopted and convenient procedure for most patients, although its application is limited when distinct sinus expansion and severe intimal damage is present. Composite valve conduit replacement (Bentall procedure) is suitable for patients with overt sinus damage. However, a fraction of patients with functional aortic valve will be unnecessarily put into risks for prosthetic complications. Valve-sparing aortic root replacement (VSRR), which includes aortic root remodeling (Yacoub procedure) and reimplantation (David procedure) techniques, has the advantage of retaining autologous aortic valve while guaranteeing resection of damaged vessel segments.The Yacoub procedure is relatively convenient but harbors long-term risk for annulus expansion, while the David procedure demonstrates long-term benefit but may be too demanding to be operated in emergent scenario as AAD. The last decade has witnessed worldwide endeavors to investigate the treatment strategy for aortic root, especially the VSRR approach. The preliminary results are encouraging and demonstrating improvements for both mid- and long-term outcomes of AAD, which enables standardized and personalized surgical management for these patients. Stanford A型主动脉夹层根部重建主要包括对主动脉窦夹层、主动脉瓣和冠状动脉开口的处理。主动脉窦部重建及升主动脉替换术较易掌握，适用于多数患者，但在治疗主动脉窦部明显扩张、内膜严重破损患者时有一定局限。主动脉根部复合替换术(Bentall手术)广泛用于窦部明显病损患者，但也舍弃了一部分质地良好的主动脉瓣，增加了不必要的人工瓣膜相关并发症。保留瓣膜的主动脉根部替换术既可切除病变管壁又能保留自身瓣膜，其中主动脉根部重塑术(Yacoub手术)操作较简单但有远期瓣环扩大可能；主动脉根部再植术(David手术)远期疗效好但手术难度大，是否适用于Stanford A型夹层尚存争议。近年来，国内外学者就不同主动脉根部重建策略进行了有益探索，为进一步提高Stanford A型主动脉夹层患者的中远期疗效奠定了基础，并推动Stanford A型主动脉夹层治疗向规范化、个体化迈进。."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, often from complications including aortic regurgitation, cardiac tamponade and myocardial infarction. Typical clinical presentation includes a sudden onset of severe chest pain, although this is not always consistent. Clinical signs and symptoms are diverse with an estimated 38% of cases being missed on initial evaluation. Primary neurological symptoms at presentation are rare but have been reported often to coexist with chest pain. We present a case of acute aortic dissection in which the initial presenting symptoms were predominantly neurological. Stanford type A dissection is a surgical emergency with a high burden of cardiovascular death; thus, aggressive identification and management is paramount. Our case re-emphasises the importance of having a higher index of suspicion and a keen clinical eye for atypical presentations of acute aortic dissection."

    "abstract": "Ascending and thoracic aortic dissections progress into thoracoabdominal aneurysms 20-40% of the time, due to the initial aortic injury with associated weakness of the aortic wall. The increased firmness of the intimal flap usually results in a collapsed true lumen that does not spontaneously reexpand even with progressive dilatation of the aorta. In an effort to identify a safe and effective treatment path for this complex disease process, we present 4 cases illustrating successful sequential thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) and fenestrated endovascular aortic repair (FEVAR). The treatment of these patients with endovascular techniques is less invasive than open conventional operations. However, multiple procedures are required using various complex novel techniques. Institutional review board approval was obtained to identify 4 cases between January 2010 and May 2015 of patients with pretreatment hypertension, who initially presented with an aortic dissection. All patients subsequently developed a descending aortic aneurysm and were treated by TEVAR and FEVAR. Monthly and yearly outcomes were analyzed. All procedures concluded with branched visceral vessel patency and no type I endoleaks. One patient required extraction of the retrograde superior mesenteric artery stent placed during the acute phase for visceral reperfusion. Another patient developed acute thromboembolic occlusion of the right common femoral artery requiring emergent revascularization in the immediate postoperative period. Aortic dissection is the most common cause of death related to aortic pathology. Treatment of type B aortic dissections has traditionally been initially medical therapy unless complications develop. The treatment of subsequent complications has been associated with a high morbidity and mortality rate. However, the advent of evolving endovascular therapies has resulted in the reassessment of how these patients might be handled. This case series illustrates the treatment of expanding chronic thoracoabdominal aortic dissecting aneurysms with a total endovascular approach using various novel techniques."

She was able to perform activities of daily living independently and had no neu- rological deficit or dementia before her admission. Con- trast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a rup- ture in the descending aorta and thrombosed type A aortic dissection. We carefully explained the need for and the risks associated with surgery to the patient and her family. After an informed consent had been obtained, she was taken to the operating room for an emergency surgery. Anesthetic management was uneventful. Trans- esophageal echocardiography was useful to evaluate her cardiac function and aortic dissection. We per- formed replacement of the total aortic arch and descending aorta successfully. On the 55th postopera- tive day, she was transferred to another hospital to undergo further physical therapy. The total hospital- ization cost was nearly 9.8 million yen. The medical cost was high in our case. In cases of nonagenarians who require an emergency cardiac surgery, we should consider the patients' age, preoperative activities of daily living, and postoperative quality of life when making decisions on surgery. The patient in our case needed to be carefully treated for airway and swallow- ing management in the early perioperative period."

No guidelines have yet been established to direct decisions on the different treatment options that can be employed in the setting of acute aortic dissections caused by PCI. However, similar cases have been treated either by intracoronary stenting and conservative management as in localized aortocoronary dissections or by surgical intervention in cases of extensive aortic dissections. Hereby, we present a rare case of a female patient who developed \"full-blown\" acute ascending aortic dissection (Stanford type A-DeBakey type II dissection) with intramural hematoma during an elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of the right coronary artery (RCA) and left circumflex artery (LCA). Accordingly, emergent surgical repair of the dissected aorta was performed including grafting of supracoronary ascending aortic tube, along with coronary artery bypass graft placement and septal myomectomy for severely hypertrophied cardiac septum. The patient recovered successfully without any documented postoperative complications. It is pivotal to avoid aggressive use of instrumentation during PTCA in order to prevent the potential development of catheter-induced aortic dissection."

Physical examination and lab data showed no specific findings except tenderness, slight white cell count elevation and decreased haemoglobin level. The patient's condition deteriorated over the following hours and he died despite resuscitation attempts. Autopsy revealed a 2.5-cm longitudinal tear in the intima of the right common iliac artery, which formed a thrombosed false lumen extending to the abdominal aorta proximally and to the left common iliac artery. Histopathologic examination revealed the characteristic changes of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). FMD involving the common iliac arteries is extremely rare; only six cases have been reported previously, and only two of those included forensic findings. The presented case is the first case of FMD with intimal tearing in the right common iliac artery, with propagation to the left common iliac artery and abdominal aorta. When a previously healthy young adult without hypertension or other risk factors presents with acute abdominal and loin pain, systemic vascular disease should be on the list of differential diagnoses.

Between January 2000 and January 2015, 587 consecutive all-comers underwent aortic arch surgery at our institution uniformly applying selective ACP (unilateral: n = 393 [67%]; bilateral: n = 194 [33%]) during moderate-to-mild systemic hypothermia (28.7 ± 0.6°C). Patients' mean age was 68 ± 16 years, 405 patients (69%) were men, and 219 patients (37%) had acute type A aortic dissection. Hemiarch replacement was performed in 386 patients (66%) whereas the remaining 201 patients (34%) underwent total arch replacement including elephant trunk (n = 74 [13%]) and frozen elephant trunk (n = 37 [6%]) procedures. Fifty-six patients (10%) have had previous aortic arch surgery. Clinical data were prospectively entered into our institutional database. Cardiopulmonary bypass time accounted for 183 ± 67 min and myocardial ischemic time reached 110 ± 45 min. Mean duration of selective ACP was 48 ± 21 (range, 12 to 135) min. Chest tube drainage during the first 24 h accounted for 597 ± 438 mL. Mean ventilation time was 31 ± 18 h. Reexploration for bleeding and postoperative renal replacement therapy was necessary in 74 patients (13%) and 49 patients (8%), respectively. Mean intensive care unit stay was 4 ± 5 days. We observed new postoperative permanent neurologic deficits in 34 patients (6%; stroke: n = 33 [6%]; paraplegia: n = 1 [0.17%]) and transient neurologic deficits in 29 patients (5%). Thirty-day mortality was 6% (n = 36). Current data suggest that selective ACP in combination with moderate-to-mild systemic hypothermia offers sufficient neurologic and visceral organ protection to all-comers requiring aortic arch surgery without pathological or procedural limitations."

The aim of our study was to evaluate long-term outcome and quality of life (QoL) after surgery for AADA in elderly patients compared with younger patients. We retrospectively evaluated 242 consecutive patients, who underwent surgery for AADA between January 2004 and April 2014. Patients were divided into two groups: those aged 70 years and older (elderly group; n  = 78, mean age, 76 ± 4 years) and those younger than 70 years (younger group; n  = 164, mean age, 56 ± 10 years). QoL was assessed with the Short Form Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36) 1 year after surgery. The questionnaire return rate was 91.0%. There were already significant differences noted between the two groups with regard to preoperative risk factors on admission. The clinical presentation with a cardiac tamponade was higher in the elderly group (62.8% vs 47.6%; P  = 0.03). Intraoperatively, complex procedures were more common in the younger group (21.3% vs 5.2%; P  = 0.001). Accordingly, cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamping times were significantly longer in the younger group. The operative mortality was similar in both groups (3.8% vs 1.2%; P  = 0.33). In the elderly population, 30-day mortality was higher (21.8% vs 7.9%; P  = 0.003). One-year (72% vs 85%), 3-year (68% vs 84%) and 5-year (63% vs 79%) survival rates were satisfactory for the elderly group, but significantly lower compared with the younger group ( P  = 0.008). The physical component summary score also was similar between the groups (39.14 ± 11.12 vs 39.12 ± 12.02; P  = 0.99). However, the mental component summary score might be slightly higher in the elderly group but not statistically significant (51.61 ± 10.73 vs 48.63 ± 11.25; P  = 0.12).

From January 2006 through July 2013, 201 patients with type A AAD underwent urgent corrective surgery at our institution. Of the 92 patients chosen for this study, 59 underwent hemiarch replacement (hemiarch group), and 33 underwent total arch replacement (total arch group) in conjunction with ascending aorta replacement. The operative mortality rate was 22%. Total arch replacement was associated with a 33% risk of operative death, versus 15% for hemiarch (P=0.044). Multivariable analysis found these independent predictors of operative death: age (odds ratio [OR]=1.13/yr; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.23; P=0.002), body mass index >30 kg/m2 (OR=9.9; 95% CI, 1.28-19; P=0.028), postoperative low cardiac output (OR=10.6; 95% CI, 1.18-25; P=0.035), and total arch replacement (OR=8.8; 95% CI, 1.39-15; P=0.021) The mean overall 5-year survival rate was 59.3% ± 5.5%, and mean 5-year freedom from distal reintervention was 95.4% ± 3.2% (P=NS). In type A AAD, aortic arch surgery is still associated with high operative mortality rates; hemiarch replacement can be performed more safely than total arch replacement. Rates of distal aortic reoperation were not different between the 2 surgical strategies."

Demographic data,operation details,perioperative findings,and follow-up results were retrospectively analyzed. Results All the 125 patients were successfully implanted with 135 stent-grafts. Thirteen cases were covered left subclavian artery,16 cases underwent left subclavian artery revascularization,and 10 cases underwent visceral artery revascularization. No perioperative mortality occurred. Meanwhile,the perioerative major adverse events included renal infarction (n=1),renal artery bleeding (n=2),stroke (n=2),myocardial infarction (n=1),and renal dysfunction (n=2;one of them suffered from permanent dialysis),and incision complication (n=5).

In 88 patients (60.2%), the associated \"wrist and thumb sign\" was present; in 58 patients (39.7%), pectus carinatum deformity; in 44 patients (30.1%), pectus excavatum; in 49 patients (33.5%), severe flatfoot; in 31 patients (21.2%), hindfoot deformity; in 54 patients (36.9%), reduced US/LS ratio or increased arm span-height ratio; in 37 patients (25.3%), scoliosis or thoracolumbar kyphosis; in 22 patients (15%), reduced elbow extension (170° or less). Acetabular protrusion was ascertained on radiographs in 27 patients (18.4%). Orthopaedic aspects of the disease are very important for an early diagnosis; however, we have not observed definite correlations between the extent of orthopaedic involvement and aortic complications."

    "title": "Endovascular Repair of Type A Aortic Dissection: Current Experience and Technical Considerations.",
    "abstract": "Dissection of the ascending aorta, type A aortic dissection (TAAD), represents a surgical emergency with high morbidity and mortality. Current open surgical techniques, although state-of-the-art procedures and having improved outcomes for patients with TAAD over the last decades, confer significant risk of complications and death. Recently, endovascular techniques for repair of both the abdominal and thoracic aorta have gained acceptance within the vascular and cardiovascular surgical communities as a useful tool in select pathologies and patient populations. As development of endovascular technology proceeds ever closer to the aortic valve, thoracic endovascular repair for TAAD deserves special investigation. A comprehensive literature search for studies reporting outcomes of endovascular repair in the ascending aorta was performed. In this review, we compile the worldwide experience of thoracic endovascular repair for TAAD as well as imaging studies for patient selection and the use of hybrid (open plus endovascular) techniques. The authors discuss the remaining challenges that preclude its broader adoption in this role, namely patient selection and device specificity."

    "title": "Acute aortic syndrome: Spectrum of imaging appearances.",
    "abstract": "The main objective of this paper is to illustrate and analyse the spectrum of MDCT findings of the entities that compose acute aortic syndrome (AAS) - namely acute aortic dissection (AD), intramural hematoma (IMH) and penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer (PAU) - discussing their pathophysiology. These related entities have a similar nonspecific clinical presentation mimicking other conditions such as myocardial infarction. Therefore, a high degree of clinical suspicion should prompt immediate confirmation by non-invasive imaging techniques which can modify its natural history, being MDCT the technique of choice, allowing accurate detection, characterization and complications evaluation in the Emergency Department. A detailed analysis of a series of clinical case of acute aortic syndrome seen at our Department is done, counselling with a review of the state of the art regarding the pathologic mechanisms, diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic management. They share a common feature of separation of the aortic walls. In AD there is an inward intimal displacement or tear, creating a true and a false lumen (double lumen). Detailing the extent, configuration - including true and false lumina distinction - and complications, are essential to proper treatment planning. IMH is defined by the presence of acute haemorrhage within wall layers without no visible intimal flap or tear on conventional techniques. It can lead to wall infarction and consequent dissection. PAU is due to erosion of internal elastic lamina - reaching the media - by an atherosclerotic plaque in the setting of advanced atherosclerosis or, less commonly, after rupture of a mycotic plaque or due to connective tissue disorders, appearing as an irregular focal contrasted outpouching outside the lumen. It can precipitate IMH or a pseudoaneurysm and progress, frequently, to dissection or rupture, coursing with high mortality, if not treated. Well known complications are aortic rupture with massive haemorrhage, pericardial tamponade by hemopericardium, mediastinal hematoma or hemothorax, pulmonary artery stenosis and/or pulmonary haemorrhage or organ ischemia. MDCT findings knowledge allows a correct diagnosis. These life-threatening entities have an undistinguishable clinical presentation but different physiopathology mechanisms - reflected in differing radiologic findings - prognosis and management. Objetivos: O presente artigo pretende ilustrar e analisar o espectro de achados tomodensitométricos (TDM) das três entidades que compõe a síndrome aórtico agudo (SAA) – designadamente dissecção aórtica aguda (DA), hematoma intramural (HIM) e úlcera aterosclerótica penetrante (UAP) – e discutir a sua fisiopatologia. Estas entidades, estreitamente relacionadas, manifestam-se, habitualmente, de forma inespecífica, mimetizando outras condições clínicas, como o enfarte agudo do miocárdio (EAM). Assim sendo, um elevado grau de suspeição clínica impõe uma confirmação imediata por técnicas de imagem não invasivas que podem modificar a história natural da doença, sendo, num contexto emergente, o estudo dinâmico multidetectores por tomografia computorizada (TC), a técnica de eleição. Permite, com elevada acuidade diagnóstica, a deteção, caracterização e a avaliação de complicações. Métodos: É feita uma análise detalhada de uma série de casos clínicos de SAA observada no nosso Departamento, conciliando com a revisão do estado da arte no que diz respeito aos mecanismos patológicos, avaliação diagnóstica e opções terapêuticas. Resultados: As três entidades partilham de uma característica comum, a separação anómala das camadas da parede aórtica. Na DA observa-se uma descontinuidade focal com destacamento da íntima em direção ao lúmen, criando um duplo lúmen (verdadeiro e falso). Detalhar a extensão, morfologia – incluindo a distinção dos dois lumens – e caracterizar possíveis complicações, são aspetos essenciais à decisão e planeamento da terapêutica. O HIM é definido pela presença de uma hemorragia aguda ou recente na espessura da parede vascular, sem que seja possível objetivar uma descontinuidade da íntima, utilizando técnicas de imagem convencionais. Poderá progredir com enfarte parietal e, consequentemente, disseção. A UAP deve-se à erosão a lâmina elástica interna – com atingimento da média – geralmente, por uma placa aterosclerótica num contexto de aterosclerose avançada; ou, menos frequentemente, é consequência da rotura de uma placa micótica, ou de doenças do tecido conjuntivo; manifestando-se por uma irregularidade com protusão focal da parede, em continuidade com o lúmen. Pode precipitar um HIM ou progredir com a formação de um pseudoaneurisma e/ou disseção, ou mesmo rotura, de elevada mortalidade se não tratados. Constituem complicações a rotura aórtica com hemorragia massiva, tamponamento pericárdico por hemopericárdio, hemotórax ou hematoma mediastínico, estenose da artéria pulmonar e/ou hemorragia pulmonar, ou isquemia de órgãos. Conclusão: O reconhecimento dos achados TDM permite um diagnóstico atempado e correto. Estas entidades – potencialmente fatais – são, muitas vezes, indistinguíveis clinicamente, embora apresentem mecanismos fisiopatológicos distintos, o que se traduz em diferentes achados imagiológicos, prognósticos e abordagens terapêuticas."

    "abstract": "Long-term survival and risk of reoperation in \"non-Marfan syndrome\" patients with a long life expectancy who undergo emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection (aTAAD) are not well known. To analyse survival, risk of reoperation and quality of life in this population. From 1990 to 2010, all patients aged≤50 years and not affected by Marfan syndrome, who underwent emergency surgery for aTAAD at two institutions, were included in this analysis. Patients were categorized into four groups according to the extension of the aortic replacement: SUPRACORONARY, ROOT, ARCH and EXTENSIVE. Sixty-six patients (mean age 45±4 years; range 34-50 years) were considered eligible for this analysis. Overall in-hospital mortality was 24% (16/66 patients); and 25%, 23%, 20.5% and 43% in the SUPRACORONARY, ROOT, ARCH and EXTENSIVE groups, respectively. Mean follow-up among survivors was 10.5±7.2 years (range: 0.1-24.7 years). Overall 10-year survival was 55±6%; and 75±12%, 69±13%, 47±8% and 28±17% in the SUPRACORONARY, ROOT, ARCH and EXTENSIVE groups, respectively. Overall freedom from reoperation on the aorta was 73±7.5%; and 40±20%, 75±21%, 78±8% and 100% in the SUPRACORONARY, ROOT, ARCH and EXTENSIVE groups, respectively. In our experience, patients who underwent isolated supracoronary ascending aorta or root replacement showed the most satisfactory late survival. However, because the risk of reoperation is low when the replacement is extended to the root, our data suggest that root replacement could represent a good compromise between operative mortality and long-term survival."

    "abstract": "The study aim was to evaluate the long-term clinical outcomes of the modified Bentall procedure (MBP) with a mechanical conduit. Between 1993 and 2014, a total of 249 patients (mean age 62 ± 12 years; range: 25-87 years) underwent a MBP at the authors' institution. The main indication was annuloaortic ectasia in 102 patients (41%), followed by acute aortic dissection in 82 patients (33%); moderate to severe aortic regurgitation was present in 79% of cases. A bicuspid aortic valve was found in 17% of patients, and Marfan syndrome in 7%. The mean NYHA functional class was 2.5 ± 1.1. Concomitant procedures were performed in 36 patients (14%). The mean follow up was 8.7 ± 5.0 years (range: 0.3-21.5 years) and was 99% complete. The total follow up was 6.475 patient-years (pt-yr). Operative mortality was 3% in elective cases. Age, prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass times and mechanical ventilation >96 h were independent risk factors for early mortality. Actuarial survival at 15 and 20 years was 62% and 60%, respectively. Risk factors for late mortality were age and emergency operation. Actuarial freedom from thromboembolism (linearized incidence 0.93%/pt-yr) was 82% at 15 years, and 74% at 20 years. Seven patients required reoperation (0.38%/pt-yr), with an actuarial freedom from reoperation of 91% at 15 years and 87% at 20 years. The incidence of overall valve-related complications was 0.32%/pt-yr, with actuarial freedoms of 94% at 15 and 20 years. The MBP has shown excellent long-term results with a low incidence of procedure-related complications up to 20 years postoperatively. For this reason, it is considered to be a valid option for the treatment of aortic root disease, whenever valvesparing procedures are not indicated."

    "abstract": "Acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is typically associated with acute coronary thrombosis or plaque rupture. Rarely, STEMI can be associated with ascending aortic dissection, which represents the majority of acute aortic syndrome aetiologies and carries dreadful outcomes. Routine cardiac intervention with emergent cardiac catheterisation may lead to a higher mortality rate in this group of patients. We present a case of painless inferior STEMI in the setting of ascending aortic dissection. The patient had an inferior STEMI due to the involvement of the right coronary artery as an extension of the ascending aortic dissection. In this era of protocol-driven practice and the pressure to fulfil quality measures, we aim to alert emergency physicians, cardiologists and interventionalists of the possible presentation of painless ascending aortic dissection as an STEMI. The two pathologies characterise by crucial differences in their initial and ultimate management."

    "abstract": "Delayed cardiac tamponade (DCT) is a rare and life-threatening complication of catheter ablation performed as a treatment of atrial fibrillation, with few cases described in the medical literature. We present the case of a 57year-old man presenting with DCT 61days following a catheter ablation procedure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most delayed case of cardiac tamponade (CT) following catheter ablation described in the literature. We also discuss the importance of point of care ultrasound (POCUS) in the diagnosis and treatment of CT. Emergency physicians must maintain a high index of suspicion in making the diagnosis of CT as patients may present with vague symptoms such as neck or back pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness, or altered mental status, often without chest pain. Common risk factors for CT include cancer, renal failure, pericarditis, cardiac surgery, myocardial rupture, trauma, and retrograde aortic dissection. In addition, although rare, both catheter ablation and use of anticoagulation carry risks of developing CT. A worldwide survey of medical centers performing catheter ablation found CT as a complication in less than 2% of cases [1]. Some proposed mechanisms of DCT include small pericardial hemorrhages following post-procedural anticoagulation or rupture of the sealed ablation-induced left atrial wall [2]. Clinical examination and electrocardiography may be helpful. However, the criterion standard for diagnosing CT is echocardiography [3]."

    "abstract": "Because of the life-threatening character and a high prevalence in emergency rooms, cardiac causes are important differential diagnoses of acute chest pain with the need for rapid clarification. In this context the working diagnosis \"acute coronary syndrome\" (ACS) plays a major role. In a synopsis of the clinical presentation, medical history, electrocardiogram and analysis of cardiac biomarkers, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina pectoris can be specified as entities of ACS. The treatment of ACS consists of an immediate anti-ischemic therapy, anti-thrombotic therapy and invasive coronary diagnostics with subsequent interventional or operative revascularization therapy. The timing of invasive management is essentially determined by the individual patient risk, with the exception of STEMI where interventional revascularization must be undertaken within 120 min of diagnosis. In this context the GRACE 2.0 and TIMI risk score have become established as reliable tools. Another rare but fatal cause of acute chest pain is aortic dissection. An abrupt onset of tearing and sharp chest pains, deficits in pulse as well as the presence of high-risk factors, such as advanced age, arterial hypertension, atherosclerosis, known collagenosis and previous aortic or coronary artery procedures are highly indicative for aortic dissection and additional diagnostic imaging and the highly sensitive D‑dimer should be undertaken. Additionally, inflammatory diseases, such as pericarditis and myocarditis can be associated with chest pains and mimic the character of ACS and should also be considered in the differential diagnostics."

    "abstract": "Evolving endovascular approaches to thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair are attractive alternatives to the \"gold standard\" of conventional open TAAA repair. However, open repair may be more suitable for younger patients. We compared the outcomes of open TAAA repair in younger (≤50 years) and older (>50 years) patients to evaluate operative risk in younger patients. We analyzed retrospective and prospective data from 3,346 cases of open TAAA repair performed between 1986 and 2015. Of those patients, 445 (13.3%) were 50 years old or younger and 2,901 (86.7%) were older than 50 years at the time of repair. In the younger cohort, 237 patients (53.3%) had connective tissue disorder, and many (n = 359, 80.7%) had aortic dissection. Younger patients tended to be in good health, and rupture was uncommon (n = 11, 2.5%). The outcomes examined included adverse event, a composite endpoint that comprised operative death or persistent stroke, paraplegia, paraparesis, or renal failure requiring dialysis. Comparisons between the two age groups showed that younger patients underwent more extent II repairs, urgent/emergent repairs, and visceral artery bypass procedures and had longer aortic clamp times. Nevertheless, younger patients had better early outcomes than did older patients, including lower rates of operative death (3.2% vs 8.2%, p = 0.002) and adverse events (5.2% vs 15.9%, p < 0.001). Multivariable analyses determined age 50 years old or younger to be an independent predictor of reduced adverse events (relative risk ratio = 0.29, p < 0.001). Early outcomes of open TAAA repair were excellent for patients 50 years old or younger, despite the fact that these patients typically required extensive repairs."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is a life-threatening rare condition that may virtually present by any organ system dysfunction, the nervous system included. Acute cerebral infarction among multiple other neurological and non-neurological presentations is part of this acute aortic syndrome. Rapid and correct diagnosis is of extreme importance keeping in mind the possibility of thrombolytic treatment if a patient with a suspected ischemic stroke arrives to the Emergency Department within a 4.5-h window after symptom onset. Systemic intravenous thrombolysis in the case of an acute brain infarction due to aortic dissection may lead to fatal outcomes. In this neurological emergency it is important to rule out underlying aortic dissection by choosing appropriately quick and accurate diagnostic tool. We aimed to present a prospective follow-up case, where carotid ultrasound examination was the primary key method that led to a correct diagnosis in hyperacute (<24h) Stanford type A aortic dissection presenting as an acute ischemic stroke, and thereafter with a repeated contrast-enhanced computed tomography and transthoracic echocardiography, helped to monitor topography of intravascular processes and hemodynamic properties during the clinical course of a disease, which influenced treatment decisions. Thus, we reviewed the literature mainly focusing on the various neurological aspects associated with aortic dissection."

Ultrasound of the heart using transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography are valuable diagnostic tools that can be used interchangeably in conjunction with other modalities such as the electrocardiogram and computed tomography for the diagnosis of cardiovascular abnormalities in trauma patients. Although ultrasound of the heart is often underused in the setting of trauma, it does have the advantages of being easily accessible, noninvasive, and rapid bedside assessment tool.

Demographics, clinical assessment, CTA contraindications, outcomes, and ED disposition were analyzed. 50 MRAs were ordered for suspected thoracic aortic dissection. 21 (42%) for iodinated contrast allergy, 21 (42%) for renal insufficiency, 2 (4%) due to both, 2 (4%) to spare ionizing radiation, 2 (4%) for further work-up after CTA, and 2 (4%) due to prior contrast enhanced CT within 24h. Median ED arrival to MRA completion time was 311min. 42 studies were fully diagnostic; 7 were limited. One patient could not tolerate the examination. 49 MRAs were completed: 2 (4%) patients had acute dissection on MRA and 47 (96%) had negative exams. 17 (35%) received gadolinium. 18 (37%) patients were discharged home from the ED with a median length of stay of 643min. 2 (4%) were admitted for acute dissection seen on MRA and 29 (59%) for further evaluation.

The technique to deploy these modular, custom-made stent-grafts is demonstrated in 2 patients with acute DeBakey type I aortic dissections and significant comorbidities precluding open surgery. Both emergent procedures were made possible by the availability of suitable devices manufactured for elective repair in other patients. After preliminary carotid-subclavian bypass, a long Lunderquist guidewire was introduced from the right femoral artery to the left ventricle for delivery of the Zenith Ascend and Zenith Branched Arch Endovascular Grafts under inflow occlusion. Bridging stent-grafts were delivered to the innominate and left common carotid arteries to connect to the 2 inner branches; the left subclavian artery was occluded. Both cases were technically successful and resulted in exclusion of the false lumen in the ascending aorta. The operating and fluoroscopy times did not exceed those of comparable elective procedures. The patients were rapidly extubated shortly after the procedure and without serious immediate complications. One patient survived 11 months with a satisfactory repair; the other succumbed to complications of recurrent pneumonia after 23 days. Endovascular treatment of patients with acute type A aortic dissection using a combination of tubular and branched stent-grafts in the ascending aorta is feasible and offers an alternative strategy to open surgery."

The dissected sinuses were excised leaving a 3-5 mm rim of the aortic wall from the attached aortic valve cusps. A short piece (4-5 cm) of collagen coated woven polyester vascular prosthesis was trimmed with one or two \"tongues\" to reconstruct the non-coronary sinus and/or the right coronary sinus, but without using separated patches. Additional procedures were including hemi-arch replacement in 11 patients, and total arch replacement plus stent-elephant trunk in 20 patients. The mean follow-up time was 36.4±3.6 months. In-hospital mortality was only 5.0% (2/40); furthermore, 3 (8.6%) patients underwent re-operation of the aortic valve and 2 (5.7%) patients died during follow-up. At the end of follow-up, trivial or no aortic regurgitation was found in 33 patients, but mild aortic regurgitation was found in 2 patients. Our data suggest that the early and mid-term results of partial aortic root remodeling were favorable, and it restored valve durability and function. Thus, the use of technique for root reconstruction in patients with acute type A dissection should be vigorously encouraged."

    "abstract": "Diagnosis of many life-threatening illnesses, including acute pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, and ischaemic bowel disease, requires confirmatory radiological imaging with radiocontrast. It is well established that radiocontrast can induce acute kidney injury, especially in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. The decision to proceed with a radiological study with radiocontrast to confirm or exclude a life-threatening, but potentially reversible, illness in patients with renal impairment is difficult. Theoretically, a radiocontrast study will be justifiable provided its benefits outweigh its harms. Using published prognostic data of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), this decision analysis aimed to assess whether a certain threshold of pre-test probability of a life-threatening illness is needed before a radiocontrast study can be justified for patients with different levels of renal impairment. In critically ill patients presenting with a life-threatening illness with hypotension requiring vasopressors or inotropes, the risk of CIN (defined by an increment in plasma creatinine of 40 µmol/l) and the associated attributable mortality after using 50 to 100 ml of radiocontrast was about 30% and 4%, respectively, for patients with baseline plasma creatinine concentrations <400 µmol/l. The risk of CIN and its associated attributable mortality increased substantially and exceeded 80% and 10%, respectively, if patients also had diabetes mellitus and their baseline plasma creatinine concentrations were >400 µmol/l. In the latter high-risk patients, using a radiocontrast study to diagnose or exclude a life-threatening illness could only be justified if the life-threatening illness was readily treatable and the pre-test probability of having such disease was greater than 15%-20%."

However, follow-up regarding outcomes is limited. This study reports mid-term outcomes with endovascular repair for ascending aortic dissections in patients deemed high risk for open repair. Between May 1, 2009 and January 31, 2011, 15 ascending aortic dissection patients (ages 45 to 78 years) ineligible for direct surgical repair underwent endovascular repair (1 acute dissection, 7 subacute dissections, and 7 chronic dissections) and were closely followed up for a median of 72 months (range 61 to 81 months). The mean interval between aortic dissection onset and treatment was 25.5 (range 6 to 353) days. Technical success was achieved in all patients. No major morbidity or deaths occurred perioperatively. During the follow-up period, there were no deaths, 8 complications occurred, and there were 4 reinterventions. A new dissection in the aortic arch was treated with a branched endograft. One patient developed retrograde aortic dissection and a left ventricular pseudoaneurysm was successfully treated with open surgery. One cardiovascular ischemia was treated with stenting and 1 supraventricular tachycardia was treated with radiofrequency ablation. Other morbidities included perigraft endoleak, a bird-beak sign, a temporary pericardial effusion, and a left kidney atrophy. Significant enlargements of true lumens and shrinkage of false lumens and overall thoracic aorta were observed at 12 months. No significant changes were detected subsequently. Minimal impact on aortic valve function was recorded over time. Our results with the novel endovascular procedure appear acceptable. Additional evidence and studies with larger sample size and longer follow-up are needed to support the durability of this new technique."

    "title": "Point of Care Echocardiography in an Acute Thoracic Dissection with Tamponade in a Young Man with Chest Pain, Tachycardia, and Fever.",
    "abstract": "Although thoracic aortic dissections are uncommon in young patients, they must be considered in the differential diagnosis in the presence of chest pain and abnormal vital signs. Although computed tomography angiography is the test of choice for thoracic dissection in the emergency department, point of care (POC) transthoracic echocardiography has a high specificity in the diagnosis of this disease. It is especially helpful in patients with proximal ascending dissections in the presence of a pericardial effusion. This case report illustrates a young patient presenting with chest pain, persistent tachycardia, and fever with a presumed upper respiratory infection who had an ascending thoracic dissection with tamponade discovered on POC echocardiography. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: POC echocardiography should be an important part of the algorithm in young patients presenting with chest pain and abnormal vital signs that do not improve with supportive measures. Definitive care in patients who present with a thoracic aortic dissection in the presence of cardiac tamponade diagnosed on POC echocardiography should not be delayed in order to wait for other imaging methods to be performed. POC echocardiography may expedite care and treatment in young patients presenting with this deadly disease."

    "title": "Association of Plasma Pentraxin-3 Levels on Admission with In-hospital Mortality in Patients with Acute Type A Aortic Dissection.",
    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection is a life-threatening cardiovascular emergency. Pentraxin-3 (PTX3) is proposed as a prognostic marker and found to be related to worse clinical outcomes in various cardiovascular diseases. This study sought to investigate the association of circulating PTX3 levels with in-hospital mortality in patients with acute Type A aortic dissection (TAAD). A total of 98 patients with TAAD between January 2012 and December 2015 were enrolled in this study. Plasma concentrations of PTX3 were measured upon admission using a high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system. Patients were divided into two groups as patients died during hospitalization (Group 1) and those who survived (Group 2). The clinical, laboratory variables, and imaging findings were analyzed between the two groups, and predictors for in-hospital mortality were evaluated using multivariate analysis. During the hospital stay, 32 (33%) patients died and 66 (67%) survived. The patients who died during hospitalization had significantly higher PTX3 levels on admission compared to those who survived. Pearson's correlation analysis demonstrated that PTX3 correlated positively with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), maximum white blood cell count, and aortic diameter. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that PTX3 levels, coronary involvement, cardiac tamponade, and a conservative treatment strategy are significant independent predictors of in-hospital mortality in patients with TAAD. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis further illustrated that PTX3 levels on admission were strong predictors of mortality with an area under the curve of 0.89. A PTX3 level ≥5.46 ng/ml showed a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 79%, and an hsCRP concentration ≥9.5 mg/L had a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 69% for predicting in-hospital mortality. High PTX3 levels on admission are independently associated with the in-hospital mortality in patients with TAAD."

    "title": "Type A aortic dissection: Are there CT signs suggestive of valvular involvement?",
    "abstract": "To identify the predictive signs of aortic valve involvement on the non-electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated admission computed tomography (CT) of patients with Type A aortic dissection (AD) according to the Stanford classification. We retrospectively analyzed the non-ECG-gated CT examinations of patients admitted to the emergency department who underwent surgery for Type A AD over a period of 4 years. The diameter of the following structures was calculated as the mean of the smallest and largest diameters (mm) measured in two different planes: aortic annulus, sinus of Valsalva, sinotubular junction, and proximal ascending aorta. These parameters were compared against operative reports in order to determine whether they were predictive of aortic valve involvement. In total, 20 patients (13 men and 7 women) of a mean age of 59.5 years (29-80) were included, 55% of patients (11/20) having surgically proven valvular involvement. The mean diameters (inmm) of the aortic annulus, sinus of Valsalva, sinotubular junction and proximal ascending aorta in the group with (and without, respectively) valvular involvement was 27.7 (26.7), 44.3 (38.1), 42.6 (36.6), and 47.8 (45.9). Only the measurement of the mean diameter of the sinuses of Valsalva was significantly predictive (p=0.02) of aortic valve involvement. Our findings suggest that measuring the diameter of the sinuses of Valsalva on non-ECG-gated admission CT examinations allows for predicting aortic valve involvement in Type A AD patients."

    "title": "Early outcomes in re-do operation after acute type A aortic dissection: results from the multicenter REAAD database.",
    "abstract": "This study provides early results of re-operations after the prior surgical treatment of acute type A aortic dissection (AAD) and identifies risk factors for mortality. Between May 2003 and January 2014, 117 aortic re-operations after an initial operation for AAD (a mean time from the first procedure was 3.98 years, with a range of 0.1-20.87 years) were performed in 110 patients (a mean age of 59.8 ± 12.6 years) in seven European institutions. The re-operation was indicated due to a proximal aortic pathology in ninety cases: twenty aortic root aneurysms, seventeen root re-dissections, twenty-seven aortic valve insufficiencies and twenty-six proximal anastomotic pseudoaneurysms. In fifty-eight cases, repetitive surgical treatment was subscripted because of distal aortic pathology: eighteen arch re-dissections, fifteen arch dilation and twenty-five anastomotic pseudoaneurysms. Surgical procedures comprised a total of seventy-one isolated proximals, thirty-one isolated distals and fifteen combined interventions. In-hospital mortality was 19.6 % (twenty-three patients); 11.1 % in patients with elective/urgent indication and 66.6 % in emergency cases. Mortality rates for isolated proximal, distal and combined operations regardless of the emergency setting were 14.1 % (10 pts.), 25.8 % (8 pts.) and 33.3 % (5 pts.), respectively. The causes of death were cardiac in eight, neurological in three, MOF in five, sepsis in two, bleeding in three and lung failure in two patients. A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that risk factors for mortality included previous distal procedure (p = 0.04), new distal procedure (p = 0.018) and emergency operation (p < 0.001). New proximal procedures were not found to be risk factors for early mortality (p = 0.15). This multicenter experience shows that the outcome of REAAD is highly dependent on the localization and extension of aortic pathology and the need for emergency treatment. Surgery in an emergency setting and distal re-do operations after previous AAD remain a surgical challenge, while proximal aortic re-operations show a lower mortality rate. Foresighted decision-making is needed in cases of AAD repair, as the results are essential preconditions for further surgical interventions."

    "title": "Chronic Type A Aortic Dissection: Two Cases and a Review of Current Management Strategies.",
    "abstract": "Stanford Type A aortic dissection is a rapidly progressing disease process that is often fatal without emergent surgical repair. A small proportion of Type A dissections go undiagnosed in the acute phase and are found upon delayed presentation of symptoms or incidentally. These chronic lesions may have a distinct natural history that may have a better prognosis and could potentially be managed differently then those presenting acutely. The method of repair depends on location and extent of the false lumen, as well as involvement of critical structures and branch arteries. Surgical repair techniques similar to those employed for acute dissection management are currently first-line therapy for chronic cases that involve the aortic valve, sinuses of Valsalva, coronary arteries, and supra-aortic branch arteries. In patients with high-risk for surgery, endovascular repairs have been successful, and active development of delivery systems and grafts will continue to enhance outcomes. We present two cases of chronic Type A aortic dissection and review the current literature."

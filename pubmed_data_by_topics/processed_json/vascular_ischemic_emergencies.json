    "abstract": "Colonoscopy is a widely used diagnostic and therapeutic procedure with a low risk of serious adverse events. Acute bilateral lower-limb paralysis following colonoscopy is extremely rare. Acute limb ischemia due to thromboembolism from abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a vascular emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and intervention. This is the report of a unique case of acute limb ischemia due to thromboembolism associated with infrarenal AAA following colonoscopy. This case report aims to raise clinical awareness of the potential risk of thromboembolic complications after colonoscopy. Further, this case suggests a potential mechanism in which hemodynamic alterations or periprocedural factors, such as dehydration associated with bowel preparation, may have contributed to thrombus dislodgement and subsequent embolization. A 67-year-old man with acute paraplegia was referred to our emergency department following colonoscopy. The patient was diagnosed with acute thromboembolism associated with an infrarenal AAA, resulting in paraplegia following colonoscopy, as confirmed by computed tomography angiography. The patient underwent emergent aorto-bifemoral bypass, bilateral lower extremity thrombectomy, and left femoral artery-to-distal superficial femoral artery bypass surgery. Although revascularization was technically successful, the patient died of massive reperfusion injury. Acute paraplegia caused by thromboembolism from an infrarenal AAA following colonoscopy is extremely rare but potentially fatal. Awareness of this potential adverse event after colonoscopy is critical to avoid severe outcomes and improve patient prognoses."

    "title": "Subclavian artery injury following clavicle fracture successfully treated with an urgent conversion to endovascular method: a case report.",
    "abstract": "Subclavian artery injury is a rare complication of clavicular fracture. This condition most often results from penetrating trauma but may also occur after blunt injury, when bone fragments cause rupture, pseudoaneurysm, dissection, or arterial thrombosis. Subclavian artery injury associated with clavicular fracture occurs in less than 1% of cases and may lead to life-threatening hemorrhage or limb ischemia. We report a case of subclavian artery injury secondary to a clavicular fracture that was successfully managed with endovascular intervention. A 48-year-old man presented to the emergency department after a downhill bicycle crash with a right midshaft clavicle fracture and was scheduled for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) 11 days later. Intraoperatively, rupture of a subclavian artery pseudoaneurysm caused massive hemorrhage. Surgical dissection was complicated by severe perivascular inflammation and a high risk of iatrogenic subclavian vein injury. Immediate conversion to an endovascular approach allowed successful hemostasis through femoral artery access and covered stent deployment, after which ORIF was completed. The patient recovered without neurovascular complications and was discharged on postoperative day 5. At 12 weeks, he achieved full shoulder range of motion, and 2-year follow-up angiography showed no stent-related complications. This case underscores the effectiveness of emergent endovascular intervention for ruptured traumatic subclavian pseudoaneurysm when inflammation and risk of iatrogenic injury preclude safe open dissection. A hybrid or rescue endovascular strategy should be considered for similar complex trauma cases."

    "abstract": "Penetrating trauma stands out as the predominant cause of vascular injury in the upper extremity, with the brachial artery being the vessel most frequently affected. While in the pediatric population, a traumatic injury to the brachial artery usually results from a distal humerus fracture; such scenarios are exceptionally reported in the adult population. We report the case of a 21-year-old woman who sustained a comminuted displaced distal humerus fracture associated with a weak radial pulse with no other ischemia signs. Only following open reduction and internal fixation did she present all signs of an acute ischemic limb. An emergency surgery showed a complex brachial artery injury over 3 cm of length. The vascular repair using a venous graft yielded a complete recovery of the patient. While brachial artery injury may be associated with distal humerus fractures in the pediatric population, this complication is exceedingly rare in adults. Our surgical case report serves as a call for clinicians to maintain a heightened awareness and suspicion for brachial artery injury, particularly in cases of severe elbow fractures. The absence of full signs of limb ischemia, owing to a rich collateral blood supply, underscores the importance of careful consideration and proactive management to address this serious complication."

    "abstract": "Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES) is a frequently underdiagnosed disease in young patients due to its low incidence and nonspecific symptoms. The disease is classified broadly into two categories: anatomic entrapment or functional entrapment. Prompt diagnosis is crucial due to the potentially limb-threatening nature of this condition should critical limb ischemia develop. A 16-year-old male soccer player with no past medical history who had 1 week of acute onset right lower extremity calf pain and foot numbness due to right proximal popliteal and tibial artery occlusion in the setting of Type 1 popliteal artery entrapment. Treatment initially included thrombolysis but was complicated by development of compartment syndrome requiring emergent four-compartment fasciotomy. He subsequently underwent thrombectomy of his popliteal, anterior, and posterior tibial arteries before definitive popliteal artery decompression with medial gastrocnemius recession and repositioning. PAES is a rare disease that can lead to devastating complications such as critical limb ischemia as seen in this patient. It is of paramount importance to identify this disease early and implement appropriate treatment. Debate remains as to the necessity of bypass or vascular repair in patients with Type 1 PAES. This patient did not undergo popliteal artery bypass and has been doing well postoperatively thus far."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) necessitates emergent surgery with optimal cerebral protection. Traditional axillary artery cannulation carries risks of brachial plexus injury and inadequate perfusion. This study evaluates a modified technique using a 10-mm vascular graft anastomosed to the innominate artery to improve cerebral and systemic perfusion. We retrospectively analyzed data from 94 consecutive ATAAD surgical patients between May 2024 and May 2025. All patients underwent hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA) combined with antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP). Perfusion was established via end-to-side anastomosis of a 10-mm straight artificial vascular graft to the innominate artery, through which both systemic arterial perfusion and ACP were conducted. In-hospital mortality was 14.89%. Mean operative times included cardiopulmonary bypass (171.27 ± 43.65 min) and circulatory arrest (25 min). Complications included stroke (10.64%), tracheostomy (17.02%), and acute kidney injury (23.40%). No upper limb ischemia or vascular injuries occurred. The modified perfusion strategy utilizing innominate artery anastomosis with an artificial vascular graft is a safe, effective, and technically reliable method. It provides excellent cerebral perfusion, unobstructed surgical visibility, and avoids upper limb ischemic complications, making it worthy of clinical promotion."

    "abstract": "Human peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) that have been most frequently used for repair or regeneration in ischemic cardiovascular disease (CVD) showed limitations in their efficacy. We previously reported that angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) is the cell-priming agent to enhance the vasculogenic potential of PBSC. The limitation was the difficulty to produce Ang1 protein with high efficiency. In this study, we engineered Ang1 structure and made FVA3-Ang1 by adding VASP and COMP sequence for stable tetramer formation as well as FLAG sequence for purification in large scale production and a signal peptide derived from influenza A virus (IAV) for better protein expression. FVA3-Ang1 showed stronger effect on endothelial cells than naïve Ang1 or COMP-Ang1 in terms of gene expression of Ang1, Ang2, VEGFA, FGF2, and KDR, as well as phosphorylation of Tie2, ERK, and Akt. Then we primed PBSC with FVA3-Ang1 and examined the transcriptome analysis. Priming for 1 h did not change whole gene expression profiles of PBSC, whereas priming for 24 h did change the pattern from myeloid toward endotheloid lineage. In mouse models of hind-limb ischemia and myocardial infarction, FVA3-Ang1-primed PBSCs showed superior engraftment and tissue regeneration compared to non-primed cells. A clinical trial is underway to assess efficacy and safety of FVA3-Ang1-primed PBSCs when infused via the culprit coronary artery following emergent stent implantation."

    "abstract": "Background: Acute infrainguinal bypass graft occlusion is a critical vascular emergency that threatens limb viability and challenges both surgical and endovascular management. Despite progress in revascularization strategies, outcomes remain suboptimal, and consensus on the optimal treatment approach is lacking. Methods: This narrative review summarizes current evidence on the epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of acute infrainguinal graft occlusion. Particular attention is given to the evolving role of catheter-directed thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy, as well as to prevention strategies based on structured surveillance and medical optimization. Results: Infrainguinal bypass failure is influenced by technical, anatomical, and systemic factors, with distinct mechanisms affecting vein and prosthetic grafts. While surgical thrombectomy remains a viable option in selected cases, endovascular techniques have gained prominence due to their minimally invasive nature and promising short-term outcomes. Prevention of occlusion through duplex surveillance and best medical therapy is crucial to preserving graft patency and reducing major amputation risk. Conclusions: Management of acute graft occlusion requires timely diagnosis and a tailored, multidisciplinary approach. Although endovascular therapies have expanded treatment options, further prospective studies are needed to define optimal strategies and improve long-term outcomes in this high-risk population."

    "abstract": "IntroductionAcute aortic occlusion (AAO) is a rare, life-threatening condition presenting with severe ischemia and requiring urgent intervention. While traditional open surgical approaches, including aortobifemoral and axillobifemoral bypasses, are well-established, endovascular techniques such as Covered Endovascular Reconstruction of the Aortic Bifurcation (CERAB) have emerged as promising alternatives in select cases. This case introduces a novel modification termed Lysis Assisted CERAB (LA CERAB), combining thrombolysis and CERAB to manage acute graft occlusions.MethodsSingle-institution case report highlighting the utility of the LA CERAB technique in select patients.ResultsA 67-year-old male presented two years post-open aortobiiliac aneurysm repair with acute abdominal pain and bilateral limb ischemia without motor impairment. Initial CTA demonstrated complete thrombosis of his graft. He underwent percutaneous bilateral transfemoral catheter-directed thrombolysis. Post-thrombolysis angiography showed graft patency but significant residual thrombus. Subsequent LA CERAB successfully re-lined the graft, secured residual thrombus, and restored perfusion. The patient had an uneventful recovery, discharged home on therapeutic anticoagulation. Follow-up CTA at 2 months demonstrated sustained graft patency. This case highlights its applicability to acute presentations and adds to a growing body of literature on acute aortic graft occlusion interventions.ConclusionThe LA CERAB technique can serve as a novel, minimally invasive approach for select AAO patients presenting with high morbidity risks for transition open surgery. This case underscores patient-specific considerations in treatment strategy selection, illustrating how individualized surgical approaches can achieve favorable immediate and sustained clinical outcomes for future patients."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous subclavian artery dissection (SSAD) is a rare vascular entity. Its clinical presentation varies significantly, ranging from asymptomatic cases to major neurological events, such as stroke or upper limb ischemia. We present a case of SSAD managed conservatively in a patient who presented with acute upper limb ischemia. A 59-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a 2-hour history of left upper limb pain, with minor motor and sensory deficit, and absence of palpable pulses. Duplex ultrasound revealed an intimal flap in the subclavian artery, while computed tomography angiography (CTA) demonstrated a dissection at the origin of the left subclavian artery that extended to the axillary artery, with distal perfusion impairment. Initial intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin, followed by therapeutic low-molecular-weight heparin during hospitalization, led to improvement in limb perfusion and restoration of palpable pulses. In addition, we provide a narrative review of the literature on SSAD. A search of PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar up to July 2025 identified 18 published case reports describing clinical presentation and treatment strategies. Spontaneous subclavian artery dissection is a rare vascular condition with diverse clinical manifestations and therapeutic approaches. Computed tomography angiography remains the primary diagnostic imaging modality in conjunction with clinical evaluation. Given the limited number of reported cases, there is currently no consensus on optimal management, and treatment should be individualized based on the patient's clinical presentation."

Despite this, some hospitals, especially in rural areas with limited access to the emergency services, have not fully adopted this model. We evaluate the safety and feasibility of same-day discharge after endovascular procedures in north wales hospitals. A study was conducted of patients who underwent day-case peripheral arterial endovascular interventions during two distinct 12-month periods: April 2019 to March 2020 and April 2021 to March 2022. Data were sourced from a prospectively maintained interventional radiology database. We defined procedural technical success as the successful distal arterial access and crossing of the target lesion. The primary endpoint was safe same-day discharge, and the secondary endpoint was any adverse event related to the intervention. Patient's demographics, clinical information (including indication: claudication versus critical limb ischemia), primary procedure details, technical success, procedural complications, and unplanned admissions were recorded. Patient's records were evaluated at a minimum of 12 months post procedure. Over 24-month period, 221 patients underwent 237 peripheral arterial interventions as day case. The mean age was 70 years with male female ratio of 2:1. The indications for intervention were claudication (55%) and critical limb ischemia (45%). The mean distance to hospital from home address was 23.6 kilometers. The most common artery undergoing treatment was the superficial femoral artery (51%). The procedure technical success rate was 90%. There were 12 (5%) complications with three (1.3%) patients requiring open surgery. The unplanned hospital admissions rate was 7.2%. The primary endpoint of safe same-day discharge was achieved in 92.8% of cases. Same day discharge following peripheral endovascular interventions is safe and feasible even in a rural setting. With a low rate of complications and unplanned admissions this model of care can be adopted universally."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia is a vascular emergency that occurs when blood flow to a limb suddenly decreases, putting the limb at risk if not treated promptly. Acute limb ischemia accounts for 11% of all vascular emergencies, among which arm ischemia is relatively rare. It is caused by occlusion of the brachial artery, most commonly by vascular thromboembolism. We report a female patient with left upper limb ischemia induced by occlusion of the brachial artery. We report a 45-year-old female who presents with an acute onset of severe pain, numbness, and pallor in her left arm. Pulse was absent, and muscle power was decreased on physical examination. The patient's past medical history was significant for chronic hypertension controlled with medication. The diagnosis of acute left arm ischemia was confirmed based on the history of hypertension and Doppler ultrasound, which showed occlusion of the left brachial artery due to atherosclerotic changes. The patient was initially treated with heparin and analgesics for pain control. Embolectomy was performed under local anesthesia, and a proximal longitudinal incision was made. The brachial artery was exposed, the proximal artery was clipped, the radial and ulnar arteries were cleared using a Fogarty balloon catheter, and the arteriotomy was closed with Prolene 6/0. Hemostasis was secured, and the skin was closed with Prolene 3/0. The patient was given Augmentin 1-g tablet \"Quaque Die\" means once daily (QD), heparin injection QD, Tonoflex P injection QD, and Loprin 75-mg tablet QD. During the 8-week follow-up period, all patient symptoms improved. The peripheral pulse was present; there were no paresthesia or numbness, except for mild pain in her left thumb due to ischemia. This was a postoperative complication due to the lodging of an embolic fragment from surgery. Early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention in brachial artery occlusion are essential to prevent complications such as gangrene, even in patients without overt vascular risk factors."

CT angiography demonstrated extensive thrombosis from the descending thoracic aorta to the iliac arteries, with complete occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery. The patient underwent urgent open embolectomy of the femoral and subclavian arteries, aorto-bifemoral bypass via axillary artery anastomoses, and bilateral lower limb fasciotomies. Although perfusion was successfully restored in the left lower limb, irreversible ischemia in the right leg necessitated an above-knee amputation. This case highlights the importance of early recognition of acute aorto-iliac thrombosis, rapid vascular imaging, and coordinated multidisciplinary intervention to optimize outcomes in this rare yet critical vascular emergency."

Therefore, this study compared the clinical outcomes of mechanical aspiration thrombectomy (MAT) versus CT in patients with LE-ALI. In this retrospective study, 105 patients (109 limbs) who underwent endovascular treatment for LE-ALI between January 2010 and March 2025 were analyzed. Thirty-one and 74 patients were treated with MAT and CT, respectively. The primary endpoint was the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade at the end of the procedure. Secondary endpoints included 30-day limb salvage (LS) and overall survival (OS) rates, primary patency, major bleeding, and perioperative complications. The MAT group had significantly higher final postprocedural TIMI flow grade than the CT group (3 [interquartile range, 3-3] vs 3 [interquartile range, 2-3]; p=0.02). Both groups had comparable 30-day LS rate, OS rate, primary patency, and incidence of major bleeding (100.0% vs 91.9%, p=0.18; 90.3% vs 98.7%, p=0.08; 87.1% vs 79.7%, p=0.42; and 9.7% vs 17.6%, p=0.38, respectively). The incidence of major complications was also similar in both groups (19.4% vs 18.9%, p =1.00). However, the MAT group had a significantly lower incidence of minor complications than the CT group (6.5% vs 27.0%, p=0.02). Compared with CT, MAT resulted in significantly improved final TIMI flow grades and fewer minor complications in patients with LE-ALI.Clinical ImpactThe present study establishes mechanical aspiration thrombectomy (MAT) using the Indigo System as a safe and efficacious alternative to conventional treatment for lower extremity acute limb ischemia. MAT resulted in superior final TIMI flow grades and a significantly reduced incidence of minor complications, with comparable rates of limb salvage and overall survival. These findings underscore MAT's potential to achieve more effective thrombus removal while minimizing procedural morbidity. For clinical practice, MAT may represent an advancement in endovascular management, offering enhanced technical performance and improved safety profiles in the treatment of this critical vascular emergency."

Occasionally, these events can occur simultaneously, even in patients under long-term anticoagulation. We present a case of a 79-year-old woman with a history of AF and anticoagulation, proposed for an emergent surgical thromboembolectomy due to acute embolic ischemia of the right lower limb. Upon arrival at the operating room (OR), she was conscious and fully aware, answering the anesthesiologist's questions when, suddenly, she experienced a loss of consciousness with apnea and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3. A head and neck computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed no acute lesions and no evidence of occlusion of the main intracranial and neck vessels. During transport to the radiology department, the patient began to slowly regain consciousness, and after the examination, she was, again, conscious and cooperative, without evident neurological deficits. After discussion with the stroke unit team, the most probable diagnosis was a vertebrobasilar territory transient ischemic attack (TIA) with quick spontaneous reperfusion. Vertebrobasilar territory ischemic events have a wide variety of presentations, with some patients presenting with coma. A concomitant ischemic stroke in a patient with an arterial thromboembolic occlusion is a rarely reported event, with potential for serious morbidity and mortality if not promptly managed. This case highlights the importance of being alert for these concomitant events, at any time, in the care of patients with other thromboembolic complications. Clinicians should maintain a high level of suspicion because the swift identification and treatment of stroke are essential to improve outcomes."

    "abstract": "The detachment of cardiogenic emboli, the formation of arterial thrombosis, and the use of tourniquets in emergency situations of massive hemorrhage can all lead to acute limb ischemia. In order to save the limb, blood flow must be rapidly restored. However, the resulting ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury may trigger systemic inflammatory responses of varying degrees, and cause damage to distant organs. Acute lung injury (ALI) caused by acute limb IR (LIR) can significantly affect the prognosis of patients. Despite a large number of previous studies, there is currently no specific exists for this condition. This study aims to investigate the potential benefits of lutein on ALI caused by LIR (LIR-ALI). Network pharmacology analysis was used to predict the key targets and signaling pathways of lutein in the treatment of ALI. In addition, we established a mice model of LIR-ALI. Histological, ELISA, and Western blotting analyses were performed to determine the therapeutic effects and potential mechanisms of action. Our study found that lutein dose-dependently mitigated lung oxidative stress, inflammatory cell infiltration, and pyroptosis-related protein expression induced by LIR. The protective effect is partially mediated by regulating the PPAR-γ/PI3K-AKT/NLRP3 pathway to inhibit pyroptosis."

Our study aimed to develop a nomogram combining biomarkers and clinical indicators to predict fasciotomy risk, enhancing early risk stratification and optimizing surgical decision-making. In this retrospective case-control study (2010-2024), data were sourced from a tertiary hospital in China. A total of 146 patients with traumatic femoral or popliteal artery injuries were stratified into fasciotomy (n = 45) and non-fasciotomy (n = 101) groups. Adhering to the events-per-variable (EPV) principle (10:1), predictors were selected via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and bootstrap validation. A multivariable logistic regression model was internally validated using tenfold cross-validation and 1000 bootstrap replicates. Four independent predictors were retained: limb ischemia severity (odds ratio [OR] = 4.25, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.97-10.02), K+ (OR = 6.99, 95% CI: 2.60-21.73), creatine kinase (CK; OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.08-1.30), and neutrophils (NEU) with a nonlinear threshold effect (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.10-1.33). The nomogram demonstrated excellent discrimination (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.877, 95% CI: 0.819-0.934), precise calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow P = 0.417), and broad clinical utility (net benefit threshold: 3-87%). This study integrated accessible clinical and laboratory data and identified limb ischemia severity, K+, CK, and NEU as factors associated with fasciotomy risk. A nomogram based on these variables demonstrated reliable predictive performance and strong clinical applicability, enabling timely risk assessment and early intervention in patients with lower extremity arterial injuries.

Stroke and myocardial infarction comprise most arterial events, with only rare involvement of the aorta and peripheral arteries. We report a 61-year-old male hospitalized for influenza A pneumonia and rhabdomyolysis who developed acute right lower limb ischemia on day 7 of his admission. Computed tomography scan of the abdomen revealed acute descending and infrarenal aortic thrombosis with embolic occlusion of the right popliteal artery. He underwent successful embolectomy and fasciotomy with good functional outcome. This case demonstrates that Influenza A infection may provoke severe and unusual thrombotic events, even during the convalescent phase of illness. Prompt diagnosis and intervention are required to reduce the risk of limb amputation and mortality. While influenza A is a known trigger for major arterial events such as stroke and myocardial infarction, this report demonstrates it may also provoke peripheral arterial thrombosis, resulting in critical limb ischemia.The diagnosis of arterial thrombosis requires a high index of suspicion, as it may occur during the convalescent phase of illness and result in loss of limb and death without emergent intervention.Although case reports suggest arterial thrombosis may be mediated by disease severity and traditional cardiovascular risk factors, limb ischemia may develop in patients without a prior history of thrombosis or established cardiovascular disease."

    "abstract": "Acute lower limb ischemia (ALLI) is a vascular emergency characterized by abrupt interruption of blood flow, with high risk of limb loss, disability, and death. Beyond ischemic insult, the ensuing inflammatory response drives endothelial injury, tissue necrosis, and systemic repercussions, shaping clinical outcomes. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to synthesize evidence on inflammatory mechanisms, immune pathways, prognostic biomarkers, and anti-inflammatory therapies in ALLI. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched for studies published in the last 15 years in English or Spanish. Eligible studies included adult patients with ALLI evaluating inflammatory pathways, circulating biomarkers, or therapies targeting inflammation. Experimental and clinical data highlight the role of the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 inflammasome, complement cascade (C3a, C5a), and pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α) in orchestrating neutrophil, macrophage, and T-cell recruitment. These cascades contribute to endothelial disruption, cell death, chronic inflammation, and systemic inflammatory response. Circulating biomarkers, such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, IL-6, and particularly the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) predict outcomes. Our meta-analysis of 7 studies (1,758 patients) showed that high NLR is associated with a 3-fold higher risk of 30-day mortality or major amputation (odds ratio 3.05; 95% confidence interval 1.69-5.52; P < 0.001). IL-1β inhibitors and other targeted agents show promise, whereas evidence for corticosteroids and TNF-α blockers remains inconsistent. Inflammation is central to the pathophysiology and prognosis of ALLI. NLR represents a robust, accessible biomarker for early risk stratification. Future strategies should emphasize biomarker-guided, personalized modulation of inflammation, supported by well-designed clinical trials."

    "abstract": "Patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) frequently experience life-threatening ischemic and bleeding complications. However, management of antithrombotic therapy after TAVI in patients without oral anticoagulation (OAC), particularly in patients with high burden for subsequent ischemic events, has limited evidence from randomized controlled trials. The REAC TAVI2 trial is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, phase III randomized trial (NCT05283356). A total of 1206 patients undergoing TAVI with high ischemic risk (defined as concomitant coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus or peripheral vascular disease) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to single antiplatelet therapy with aspirin (100 mg once daily) or low-dose ticagrelor (60 mg twice daily). The primary endpoint is the incidence of a net adverse clinical event (NACE) at 1-year after TAVI. NACE is defined as a composite of all-cause mortality, cerebrovascular events, myocardial infarction, progressive angina leading to emergency evaluation, rehospitalization or new coronary angiogram, clinical valve thrombosis, acute limb ischemia leading to hospitalization, and type 2, 3, or 5 bleeding. The secondary endpoint is the incidence of subclinical valve thrombosis detected by hypo-attenuated leaflet thickening and reduced leaflet motion at 3 and 12 months post-TAVI assessed by 4-dimensional computed tomography. In patients undergoing TAVI without an indication for OAC, there is a need for antiplatelet therapy that provides protection against ischemic events without increasing bleeding, particularly in the subset of patients at heightened risk of ischemic events. The REAC-TAVI 2 is a randomized multicenter clinical trial designed to study the effect of single antiplatelet therapy with aspirin compared to low-dose ticagrelor on a composite outcome of all-cause mortality, ischemic, and bleeding events after TAVI."

    "title": "The value of vascular surgeons in modern health care systems: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Vascular surgeons are crucial in modern health care, offering indispensable support across surgical services. Despite their clinical and economic contributions, their full value often goes unrecognized. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the interdisciplinary and financial impact of vascular surgeons within contemporary health care systems. A systematic search was conducted in August 2024 across MEDLINE, PubMed, the Cochrane Vascular Registers, and other databases. The studies included randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and economic evaluations published from 2010 onward. Dual reviewer screening and data extraction followed PRISMA guidelines, and the study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024589273). Quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Meta-analyses employed random effects models, with heterogeneity assessed via I2 and Cochran's Q tests. Of 3031 screened records, 29 studies involving 6557 patients met the inclusion criteria. Vascular surgery consultations were most frequently requested by emergency medicine (15.3%), orthopedics (14.1%), trauma (12.2%), and neurosurgery (10.1%). Hemorrhage control (16.4%) and ischemia (14.1%) were the primary reasons for consultations. Vascular surgeons performed 928 procedures, predominantly primary repairs (49.2%) and graft placements (17.7%). Multidisciplinary collaboration, particularly in surgical oncology and podiatry, significantly improved outcomes, including revascularization success in cases of acute limb ischemia and intraoperative arterial injuries (94%), decreased amputation rates, and enhanced margin-negative resections. Financial analyses revealed that vascular surgery contributes substantial work relative value units (wRVUs) and revenue, with some services generating >$130 million over 5 years. Meta-analysis identified pooled consultation proportions of 22% among urology, orthopedics, and general surgery, with significant heterogeneity (I2 = 98.7%). Meta-regression confirmed consultation volume as a significant predictor of pooled effect size. Vascular surgeons play a crucial role in interdisciplinary health care and are a valuable financial resource in medical services. Their participation improves surgical results, decreases complications, and enhances hospital profitability. It is essential to strategically incorporate and acknowledge vascular surgery within multidisciplinary teams and institutional planning to optimize patient care, revenue generation, and system efficiency."

    "title": "Surgical Repair of Popliteal Artery Aneurysms Still Represent the Gold Standard: A Contemporary Cohort Study from a High-Volume Centre and Comparison with Contemporary Endovascular Series.",
    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Despite their low incidence, popliteal artery aneurysms (PAAs) are the most common aneurysms of the peripheral arteries and carry a high risk of limb loss. The optimal treatment, either with open (OR) or endovascular repair (ER), remains debated due to the lack of high-level evidence. Methods: In accordance with STROBE guidelines, we conducted a retrospective observational study with a prospective follow-up. All patients presenting with a PAA who underwent elective OR in the Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Unit of Agostino Gemelli Hospital (Rome, Italy) over the last four years were enrollved. Urgent and endovascular cases were excluded. Clinical examination, Doppler ultrasound (DUS), and contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography (CTA) were performed preoperatively. Clinical and DUS follow-up was performed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively and annually thereafter. Endpoints were the primary, primary assisted, and secondary patency calculated using a Kaplan-Maier estimate based on the \"first event\" (arterial stenosis, occlusion, or reintervention) after the procedure. Amputation rate and overall mortality were also assessed. The results were compared with the success and complication rates reported in contemporary endovascular series. Results: Overall, 62 open interventions for popliteal artery aneurysms were performed during the study period; 49 patients (100% male, 70.3 SD ± 8.8 years) were included for a total of 52 PAAs treated electively (median diameter 30.5 mm, range 20-75; 92.3% fusiform). Aneurysm involved P1 segment in 38.5% of cases (20), P2 in 48.1% of cases (25), and P3 in 13.5% of cases (7). Two runoff vessels were present in most patients (37, 71.2%). Surgery consisted of the aneurysm's exclusion through ligation and autologous vein or prosthetic bypass (25, 48.1%) or aneurysmectomy and interposition graft or end-to-end anastomosis (27, 51.9%). At a mean follow-up of 18 months (SD ± 17.7), the primary, the primary assisted, and the secondary patency were 94.3%, 100%, and 100% respectively. No minor nor major amputations and no deaths were reported. Conclusions: In the endovascular era, our results highlight that regardless the specific characteristics-including age, comorbidities, and aneurysm anatomy-OR provides excellent early and mid-term outcomes with high patency and low complication rate compared with contemporary endovascular series reported in the literature."

    "title": "Predictors of surgical site infection following infrainguinal bypass surgery: An analysis of the Vascular Quality Initiative data.",
    "abstract": "Surgical site infection (SSI) is a common complication after infrainguinal bypass (IIB) in patients with peripheral artery disease, leading to significant morbidity, including prolonged hospital stays, increased readmission rates, graft failure, and mortality. Despite advances in aseptic techniques, SSI continues to impact patient outcomes, driven by a complex interplay of patient-specific and procedural factors. This study aims to identify predictors of postoperative SSI in patients undergoing IIB providing insights into potentially modifiable risk factors. We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing IIB for peripheral artery disease in the Vascular Quality Initiative database from 2010 to 2024. Patients with concomitant ipsilateral major amputation, suprainguinal bypass, acute limb ischemia, or aneurysmal disease were excluded. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors associated with postoperative SSI. Of 59,221 patients undergoing IIB, 1857 (3.1%) developed SSI. Patients with SSI were more likely to be female, obese, and have chronic kidney disease or congestive heart failure (CHF). Urgent procedures, longer operative times, intraoperative blood transfusions, autogenous grafts, and below-knee bypasses were also more common in the SSI group. Multivariable analysis identified several significant predictors of SSI. Among patient factors, non-U.S. insurance (odds ratio [OR]: 2.84; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.43-5.65; P = .003) and obesity (body mass index [BMI] 25-29.9: OR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.09-1.88, P = .01; BMI 30-40: OR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.21-2.21, P < .001; BMI ≥40: OR: 2.22, 95% CI: 1.57-3.13, P < .001) were associated with an increased risk of SSI. Rest pain (OR: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.01-1.49; P = .04) and tissue loss (OR: 1.67; 95% CI: 1.38-2.03; P<.001) were also associated with increased risks of SSI. Comorbidities, including untreated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.01-1.44; P = .04), severe CHF (OR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.13-3.14; P = .01), untreated diabetes mellitus (DM) (OR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.02-1.70; P = .03), and end-stage renal disease (OR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.01-3.33; P = .046), were significantly associated with SSI. Perioperative factors such as intraoperative blood transfusion (OR: 2.28; 95% CI: 2.00-2.59; P < .001), prolonged operative time ≥150 minutes (OR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.20-1.89; P < .001), and ≥300 minutes (OR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.50-2.54; P < .001) increased the risk of SSI. Protective factors included medication-controlled DM (OR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.58-0.97; P < .03), preoperative antibiotics (OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.64-0.85; P < .001), prosthetic grafts (OR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.74-0.99; P = .03), and using chlorhexidine (CHG) or iodine alone vs CHG-iodine combined for skin preparation (CHG: OR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.34-0.69, P < .001; iodine: OR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.33-0.84, P = .007). This study confirms several risk factors for SSI including increased SSI risk with higher BMI, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, CHF, untreated DM, rest pain or tissue loss presentation, intraoperative blood transfusion, and prolonged operative time. Protective factors, including preoperative antibiotic use, and medication-controlled DM and hypertension underscore the importance of optimizing perioperative care to reduce SSI risk. These findings highlight opportunities for targeted interventions and personalized risk stratification to reduce SSI and improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is associated with a high risk of limb loss and mortality, even after surgical intervention. Recent findings suggest the beneficial role of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in predicting limb amputation and mortality in ALI patients. This current study aims to evaluate the role of NLR in predicting all-cause mortality (ACM) and amputations due to vascular events in patients with ALI. A systematic literature search was conducted across several databases. Meta-analysis with a random-effects model was used to quantitatively estimate the pooled odds ratio, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV), while a bivariate meta-analysis was used to generate the summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Five observational studies met predefined criteria. Patients with high NLR had a 7.5 times higher risk of 30-d and a 3.4 times higher risk of 2-y amputation compared to those with low NLR. The pooled sensitivity for 30-d and 2-y amputation was 81.3% and 71.0%, while the pooled specificity was 73.8% and 63.5%, respectively. For 30-d ACM, patients with high NLR had a nine times higher risk, while the risk was 1.5 times higher for 2-y ACM. The pooled sensitivity for predicting 30-d and 2-y ACM was 81.5% and 58.8%, with pooled specificity of 76.0% and 59.3%, respectively. NLR is a valuable predictor of short-term outcomes in patients with ALI, with higher predictive performance for 30-d amputation and ACM compared to 2-y outcomes. Its simplicity and availability make it a valuable tool in emergency settings."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia (ALI) involving the upper limbs is a vascular emergency that represents only 5% to 10% of all ALI cases. Prompt diagnosis and intervention are crucial to prevent irreversible damage, particularly in resource-limited hospitals. A 56-year-old woman hospitalized with atrial fibrillation and acute decompensated heart failure developed sudden left upper limb weakness and sensory loss. Bedside Doppler ultrasonography confirmed axillary artery occlusion (Rutherford IIb). Given limited resources, she underwent successful manual thrombosuction followed by catheter-directed thrombolysis with alteplase, restoring distal perfusion without complications. This case illustrates a rare but critical presentation of cardioembolic upper limb ALI. Despite limited vascular technology, a pragmatic endovascular approach led to limb salvage. It highlights the feasibility of guideline-adapted care in nontertiary settings. Even in hospitals with limited facilities, early recognition and tailored endovascular strategies can yield successful outcomes in upper limb ALI."

    "abstract": "ObjectiveAcute limb ischemia (ALI) is a time-sensitive vascular emergency that often presents to the emergency department and can result in limb loss or mortality if not managed promptly. Identifying simple, cost-effective biomarkers at the time of initial emergency department evaluation could facilitate early risk stratification and guide timely intervention, particularly in resource-limited settings. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of three readily available laboratory markers-neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine ratio-for assessing amputation risk in patients with ALI.MethodsWe conducted a single-center, retrospective cross-sectional study of 138 patients diagnosed with ALI who presented to the emergency department between January 2020 and January 2023. Demographic and laboratory data were collected. ROC analysis was performed to evaluate the predictive performance of NLR, PLR, and BUN/creatinine ratio for amputation risk, and multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors.ResultsAmong the biomarkers analyzed, the BUN/creatinine ratio demonstrated the highest predictive performance for amputation risk (AUC: 0.727, sensitivity: 69.0%, specificity: 68.8%), although the discriminative ability was only moderate. NLR (AUC: 0.666) and PLR (AUC: 0.647) also showed associations with amputation risk, though with lower predictive values. Female gender emerged as an additional independent predictor of amputation risk (OR: 4.16, 95% CI: 1.47-11.81, P = .007).ConclusionsOur findings suggest that the BUN/creatinine ratio may serve as an accessible biomarker with moderate predictive performance, whose main utility may lie in helping to exclude patients at low risk of amputation. While NLR and PLR also showed potential value, further prospective multicenter studies are required to validate their clinical applicability."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous sub-amputation is a rare manifestation of critical limb ischemia (CLI), most often associated with advanced vascular disease and comorbidities. We present a case of spontaneous foot sub-amputation in an elderly patient without major lifestyle-related risk factors, managed in a resource-limited setting. A 76-year-old male with no history of diabetes, hypertension, or smoking presented after his left foot detached spontaneously during sleep, following two months of leg pain and two days of worsening discoloration and fever. On examination, he was septic, with absent left femoral and popliteal pulses and advanced gangrene. Imaging was not performed due to systemic and facility constraints. Emergency above-knee amputation was performed. Intraoperatively, thrombus removal was achieved using a Foley catheter in place of a Fogarty catheter. Postoperatively, the patient stabilized and showed good wound healing. Further diagnostics, including histopathology and thrombophilia screening, were not feasible due to financial and systemic limitations. This case highlights an atypical CLI presentation in a patient without conventional lifestyle-associated risk factors, but with overlooked contributors such as prediabetes. The absence of imaging and vascular tools required improvisation for timely limb removal. The use of a Foley catheter for thrombectomy demonstrates adaptable practice in low-resource environments. Although the underlying etiology could not be fully confirmed, acute-on-chronic arterial occlusion was the most plausible diagnosis. Early recognition, sound clinical judgment, and surgical adaptability are vital in underserved settings. This case demonstrates that even with limited diagnostics and resources, effective outcomes can still be achieved."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is a vascular emergency that demands prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention. This study investigated the incidence, clinical presentation, and outcomes of upper-extremity ALI and examined the impact of patient risk factors on these outcomes. A retrospective review of patients who underwent upper-extremity revascularization for ALI at a single health care system from 2003 to 2023 was conducted. Patients with ischemia duration under 14 days were included. Data on demographics, hypercoagulability risk factors, ischemia duration, clinical presentation, etiology, hospitalization length, and complications were analyzed. Three hundred sixty-six patients underwent revascularization for ALI during the study period. The average age of the patients was 65.0 ± 17.0 years, and 69.7% were women. Common etiologies included embolism from atrial fibrillation (21.5%) and iatrogenic injury (29.3%). The brachial artery was the most common occlusion site (89%). The median ischemia time was 12.0 hours (IQR = 29.2). Pain and paresthesia at initial presentation were considerably associated with increased duration of ischemia. Eighty patients (21.9%) experienced complications. Eleven patients (3%) who received prophylactic fasciotomy had a median ischemia duration of 22 (13-76) hours, which was similar to patients without prophylactic fasciotomy (14 [7-35] hours). Prophylactic fasciotomy was also associated with increased complications. Upper-extremity ALI revascularization has a high complication rate. Although longer ischemia duration may intensify symptoms, it does not predict complications or hospital stay. Prophylactic fasciotomy, lacking clear benefit, may increase risks, and calls into question its routine use in upper-extremity ALI cases. Prognostic IV."

    "abstract": "Frozen elephant trunk (FET) is being increasingly used for acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) with distal malperfusion. The efficacy of adding a stent graft remains unclear, however. This study investigated the efficacy of adding FET to conventional arch repair when treating ATAAD with iliofemoral or renal malperfusion. A review of the Emory Aortic Database identified 969 patients with acute DeBakey 1 dissection from 2004 to February 2025. One hundred fifty-three patients with iliofemoral and/or renal malperfusion underwent emergent central aortic repair alone (conventional group; n = 102) or central repair plus FET (FET group; n = 51). Univariate statistics were used to compare the 2 groups. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with postoperative limb revascularization and new renal failure. Selection bias was addressed through inverse-probability treatment weighting adjustment. Age and preoperative comorbidities were equivalent in the 2 groups. Limb ischemia requiring revascularization (17.6% for conventional vs 15.7% for FET; P = .856), or new dialysis (21.6% for conventional vs 17.6% for FET; P = .547) also was similar between the groups. Multivariable regression did not identify FET as independently associated with a reduced need for limb revascularization in iliofemoral malperfusion patients (odds ratio [OR], 1.334; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.434-4.098; P = .614) or with avoiding dialysis in renal malperfusion patients (OR, 1.166; 95% CI, 0.252-5.382; P = .844). Mid-term survival (71.1% for conventional 71.1% vs 75.5% for FET; log-rank P = .753) and distal reintervention-free survival (64.9% for conventional vs 69.4% for FET; log-rank P = .902) were equivalent. The addition of FET to conventional repair did not impact limb revascularization, new dialysis, or mid-term reintervention or improve mid-term survival in ATAAD with iliofemoral or renal malperfusion."

    "abstract": "Primary cardiac tumors are rare with myxomas representing about 50 % of benign types, typically arising sporadically in adults aged 30-60 and predominantly in the left atrium. Symptoms result from obstruction, embolization or arrhythmias. Embolic complications, particularly in young patients without cardiovascular risk factors, should raise suspicion of an intracardiac tumor. Prompt recognition and management are critical to prevent serious outcomes. A 24-year-old woman presented with sudden bilateral lower limb paralysis and ischemic pain. Clinical evaluation revealed absent pulses and sensory-motor deficits in both legs. CTA demonstrated thrombotic occlusion at the aortic bifurcation and major arteries of both lower limbs, as well as signs of renal and splenic ischemia. Emergency embolectomy was performed using a Fogarty catheter and histopathology of embolic material revealed a cardiac myxoma. On postoperative day 0, reperfusion syndrome developed in the right leg necessitating fasciotomy. Echocardiography identified a left atrial mass which was surgically excised. The patient recovered with residual right peroneal nerve palsy and was referred for rehabilitation. In young patients with embolic events and no prior cardiac disease, intracardiac tumors must be considered. Echocardiography is the diagnostic modality of choice, supported by CT/MRI when needed. Surgical resection is curative, but complications such as reperfusion syndrome can arise. Long-term follow-up with annual echocardiography is recommended due to recurrence risk. This case illustrates the importance of early diagnosis, multidisciplinary intervention and coordinated care in achieving favorable outcomes in patients with cardiac myxoma presenting with acute embolic events."

Conventional treatments, including surgical revascularization and percutaneous interventions, are constrained by invasiveness and unsuitability for certain patients, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches. Emerging strategies that regulate endogenous cell behavior offer an effective, less traumatic alternative with wider applicability. This review systematically summarizes therapeutic approaches focused on key cell populations-endothelial cells, macrophages, muscle satellite cells, and pericytes-integral to the pathogenesis and repair mechanisms of CLI. We focus on molecular interventions aimed at regulating growth factors, transcription factors, inflammatory mediators, and metabolic pathways to promote endothelial tube formation, macrophage reprogramming, muscle regeneration, and pericyte recruitment, ultimately enhancing collateral circulation, improving the microenvironment, and driving tissue repair. Additionally, we discuss the integration of advanced bioengineering approaches that leverage tools such as gene therapy, gasotransmitters, intelligent delivery systems, and functional biomaterials, which have significantly expanded the potential of CLI treatment. These engineered materials not only serve as carriers for targeted therapeutics but also actively modulate cellular behavior, providing sustained and localized intervention to optimize vascular repair and regeneration. Furthermore, the significance of intercellular crosstalk in the progression and treatment of CLI is emphasized, with great potential for synergistic enhancement of efficacy. By synthesizing the latest findings in CLI therapies based on cell behavior modulation, this review provides reference for innovative treatment paradigms and clinical applications."

We report on an 85-year-old female who presented at Emergency County Hospital Tg Mures in March 2025 in critical respiratory distress, with documented tracheal deviation, orthopnea, and multiple episodes of cardiorespiratory arrest. Clinical and radiologic assessment revealed a giant anterior cervical mass with retrosternal extension and near-complete tracheal compression. Emergency airway control was achieved via awake fiberoptic intubation, followed by urgent total thyroidectomy. Intraoperative findings included significant tracheomalacia, prompting the need for concurrent tracheostomy. Postoperatively, the patient required intensive care monitoring and developed two systemic complications, a right hemispheric ischemic stroke and acute limb ischemia, both of which were managed conservatively. Histopathological analysis confirmed a benign multinodular goiter. This case emphasizes the importance of prompt recognition and surgical intervention in life-threatening compressive goiter, particularly in elderly patients, to prevent airway collapse and optimize outcomes."

    "abstract": "Traumatic limb pseudoaneurysms are rare vascular complications that can cause acute limb ischemia and require urgent treatment. Traditionally addressed through open surgical repair, advances in endovascular techniques have introduced less invasive options, particularly beneficial for high-risk patients. This article presents two cases illustrating individualized decision-making in choosing between endovascular and open surgical repair. A comparative case-based approach was employed. The first case involved a 94-year-old male with multiple comorbidities and a femoral pseudoaneurysm following blunt trauma. Due to anesthetic risk, endovascular repair with overlapping stent grafts was performed. The second case described a 34-year-old male with a delayed presentation of a traumatic axillary artery pseudoaneurysm. Open surgical exploration and autologous vein graft interposition were undertaken. In the elderly patient, the endovascular approach achieved rapid exclusion of the pseudoaneurysm, with restoration of limb perfusion and no postoperative bleeding. In the younger patient, open surgery successfully re-established arterial continuity and function. Some residual sensory deficits persisted due to delayed presentation, but follow-up showed good perfusion and no signs of ischemia. These cases highlight the importance of patient-specific management. Endovascular repair offers a minimally invasive solution with lower perioperative risk, especially suitable for elderly or frail patients. Open surgery remains essential for durable reconstruction in young, otherwise healthy individuals or in anatomically complex cases. Selection of the optimal approach depends on age, comorbidities, pseudoaneurysm location, and time from injury to presentation. Traumatic pseudoaneurysms require individualized management strategies. Minimally invasive repair is generally reserved for patients at elevated surgical risk, whereas open repair remains a durable option for younger, healthier individuals. These cases reflect the need for flexible, evidence-informed decision-making in vascular trauma. With limited large-scale data and standardized protocols, further research is needed to guide optimal treatment strategies."

This report presents the case of an 11-year-old male who developed multiple peripheral emboli following the detachment of a left atrial myxoma. The patient presented to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain and sudden-onset pain and sensory loss in both legs. Physical examination indicated bilateral lower limb ischemia, which was corroborated by Doppler arterial ultrasound, revealing emboli in the abdominal aorta and bilateral common iliac arteries. Abdominal CT demonstrated patchy non-enhancing low-density areas in both kidneys and the spleen, while echocardiography identified a left atrial mass. A diagnosis of acute lower limb arterial embolism, renal embolism, and splenic embolism secondary to left atrial myxoma was established. Additionally, lower limb ischemia resulted in acute compartment syndrome. The multidisciplinary team initiated systemic anticoagulation, followed by abdominal aortic embolectomy, fasciotomy decompression, and left atrial myxoma resection. Postoperative outcomes were favorable, with no residual tumor in the left atrium and complete restoration of arterial perfusion in both lower limbs. Histopathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of myxoma. Although pediatric cardiac myxoma is exceedingly rare, the clinical presentation of peripheral embolism in this case raised a strong suspicion of an embolic etiology, facilitating rapid assessment and timely intervention."

Patients who have symptoms suggestive of PAD should undergo diagnostic testing using the ankle-brachial index (ABI). An ABI value of 0.9 or less is consistent with a diagnosis of PAD. An exercise ABI should be considered if ABI is normal and there is a high clinical suspicion for PAD. An ABI of 1.4 or greater is considered inconclusive or noncompressible and warrants further evaluation with alternative testing. This is most common in patients with diabetes and end-stage renal disease. Treatment for PAD includes structured exercise therapy, a single antiplatelet medication (clopidogrel preferred), a high-intensity statin, blood pressure control, antidiabetic agents (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors), and smoking cessation when applicable. Patients who do not improve with initial treatment and those with chronic limb-threatening ischemia should be evaluated for revascularization, using imaging to determine the location and severity of arterial disease. Patients with acute limb ischemia require urgent evaluation to preserve limb viability."

    "title": "Postero-lateral elbow dislocation with traumatic brachial artery disruption.",
    "abstract": "Dislocations of the elbow are the second most common large joint dislocation, following shoulder dislocations. Most are closed reductions, especially posterior or posterolateral types, and do not require surgical intervention. When an elbow dislocation involves a vascular structure-usually the brachial artery-this injury becomes a rare and life-threatening emergency. Collateral circulation can maintain distal pulses, so these injuries can be underdiagnosed. Without rapid intervention, complications of limb ischemia, compartment syndrome, nerve injury, and even amputation can occur. This report describes a case of a 38-year-old female with complete transection of the brachial artery after elbow dislocation, emphasizing the importance of a thorough vascular assessment in the trauma setting. This case illustrates that a routine elbow injury can be catastrophic when there is a vascular injury. Given that the distal pulses can be maintained, an arterial injury should not be excluded based on pulse alone. Rapid surgery and a multidisciplinary approach were able to address the vascular repair and reduce the joint. This case also exemplifies the multiple complications that can occur with such injuries, including anterior interosseous nerve palsy. This case provides an example of a rare injury and treatment, which may aid in future patient care in the field of underrecognized and high-risk elbow trauma."

    "abstract": "A 50-year-old woman required an emergent operative exploration after an unsuccessful attempt at bedside removal of a ruptured intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). Initial fluoroscopy demonstrated that the IABP tip moved dynamically with blood flow, but retraction and advancement caused significant bowing of the proximal external iliac artery. After unsuccessful endovascular snaring and resheathing, an exploratory laparotomy was required to remove the entrapped IABP via a longitudinal external iliac arteriotomy. Proximal to the patch angioplasty, an occlusive dissection flap was identified, requiring stent placement. Back table examination showed an exposed metallic knob, concerning for a manufacturing or iatrogenic defect, that likely caused this complication. The patient's health care proxy consented to the publication of this patient's operative course."

    "abstract": "The study aimed to evaluate the mid-term outcomes of patients admitted for a diabetic foot attack (DFA). It is a retrospective observational study including a population of patients admitted for diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) into a specialized multidisciplinary diabetic foot service. Based on the type of hospital admission (emergency or elective), patients were divided into two groups: those with DFA and those without DFA (chronic diabetic foot, CDF). The DFA was considered in case of ischemia (acute or chronic), infection and Charcot foot requiring urgent hospitalization. Once discharged, patients were regularly followed as outpatients with the following six-month outcomes: healing; major amputation; mortality; hospital readmission; non-fatal major adverse limb and cardiovascular events (MALCE) including nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke, and limb ischemia requiring revascularization. Overall, 141 patients were included. The mean age was 70 ± 12 years, most patients were male (76.6%) and had type 2 diabetes (93.6%) with a mean duration of 22 ± 13 years; 81 (57.4%) patients presented DFA while 60 (42.6%) presented CDF. No cases of admitted Charcot foot were recorded. The DFA group reported 81.5% cases of severe/moderate infections, while the CDF group presented 50% of mild infections. The DFA group reported higher HbA1c values (67 ± 22 vs 56 ± 14 mmol/mol, p = 0.0008) and more cases of first assessment for DFUs (59.3 vs 13.3%, p < 0.0001) when compared to the CDF group. The six-month follow-up outcomes for DFA and CDF were: healing (65.4 vs 60.0%, p = 0.3); major amputation (4.9 vs 1.7%, p = 0.2); mortality (8.6 vs 11.7%, p = 0.5); hospital readmission (27.2 vs 26.7%, p = 0.8); non-fatal MALCE (9.9 vs 23.3%, p = 0.1). Six-month outcomes did not show significant differences between the DFA and CDF groups in terms of healing, major amputation, mortality, readmission, and non-fatal MALCE. Adequate management of DFA seems to ensure favourable mid-term outcomes, even if compared to patients with CDF."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia (ALI), especially acute lower limb ischemia (ALLI), is a common clinical vascular emergency with high amputation and mortality rates. However, major challenges exist in rapidly diagnosing and assessing collateral vascular compensatory capacity, leading to appropriate clinical treatment strategies to improve limb preservation and reduce recurrence rates. Traditional imaging methods, such as digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and ultrasound, have high demands on patient kidney function and operator maneuvers and are unable to monitor the temporal and spatial variability of collateral circulation establishment in the limb. In this study, we report the first combined use of real-time and wide-field laser speckle imaging (RFLSI), near-infrared two-zone imaging (NIR-II), duplex ultrasound (DUS), and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) for the diagnosis and monitoring of ALLI in male C57 and ICR mice. The RFLSI assesses overall perfusion, the NIR-II allows rapid diagnosis and monitoring of the establishment of collateral circulation, DUS monitors muscle tenderness and stiffness, and OCTA detects microcirculation in the skin of the limb, which is confirmed by histopathological testing. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate the ability to accurately diagnose and detect ALLI with the help of a variety of optical and acoustic imaging devices, with significant clinical translational implications for intervention in clinical decision-making preoperatively and prognostic assessment postoperatively."

    "abstract": "Blunt trauma can cause significant vascular injury even in the absence of fractures or penetrating wounds, and such injuries are often underdiagnosed. In this case, the rarity lies in the intraoperative identification of an unusually extensive thrombus measuring 71 cm in length - an exceptional finding rarely described in blunt vascular trauma. We report a case of a 59-year-old male who sustained trauma to the left groin from a motorcycle handlebar impact during a road traffic accident. He presented six hours after the incident with absent distal pulses and delayed capillary refill in the affected limb. Computed tomography angiography revealed complete non-opacification of the left common femoral artery and proximal superficial femoral artery over a 4.4 cm segment, suggestive of arterial thrombosis. Emergency surgical exploration confirmed the thrombus, which was successfully extracted using a Fogarty catheter. The contused arterial segment was resected, and a tension-free end-to-end anastomosis was completed using a 6-0 Prolene suture. Based on clinical assessment, the limb ischemia was classified as Rutherford Grade IIa, indicating a marginally threatened limb requiring prompt intervention. Postoperatively, limb perfusion was restored with no signs of ischemic complications, and the patient regained full function. At six-week follow-up, triphasic flow was confirmed on Doppler ultrasound. This case underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for vascular injury in blunt trauma patients, particularly when skeletal injury is absent. Early diagnosis and timely surgical management are vital to prevent limb loss and ensure favorable outcomes."

    "abstract": "Timely access to care is critical in time-dependent pathologies such as acute limb ischemia (ALI). Interhospital transfer may increase access to specialist care but at the risk of increasing time to revascularization. The aim of this study is to explore associations between interhospital transfer and outcomes in patients presenting with ALI, with the goal of generating hypotheses for future prospective research. A retrospective analysis was performed using survey-weighted data from the National Inpatient Sample database (2019-2021). Patients aged ≥18 years who were hospitalized with ALI, based on International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision codes, were analyzed. Outcomes including comorbid conditions, methods of revascularization, limb salvage, organ failure, and mortality. Comparisons were made between patients undergoing transfer or not as part of their care. The χ2 test was used for univariate comparison and multivariate modeling used to control for covariates. Comparisons are presented using proportions and odds ratio [95% confidence intervals] (P values). Among 33,434 survey-weighted cases of ALI, 7950 patients (24%) were transferred to another facility. Transfers were significantly more common in micropolitan (3.2 [3.0-3.4]; P < .001) and noncore areas (2.5 [2.3-2.7]; P < .001) when compared with large central and fringe metropolitan areas. Transferred patients exhibited higher rates of primary amputation (4.7% vs 2.7%, P < .0001) and amputation after attempted revascularization (4.6% vs 2.5%, P < .0001). Transferred patients underwent higher rates of surgical thrombectomy (46.5% vs 38.7% P < .001), fasciotomies (3.1% vs 2.1%, P < .001), and hemodialysis (2.4% vs 1.5%, P < .001). Transferred patients had a higher in-hospital mortality (8.6% vs 4.4%, P < .001) than those who were not transferred. Patients presenting with ALI who require hospital transfer have higher mortality and morbidity than patients undergoing definitive care on index admission. The reason for these finding is likely multifactorial and include disease complexity, prolonged warm ischemic times, and vascular surgical workforce distribution. Although expanding the vascular surgery workforce in underserved areas would be ideal, this remains unlikely in the short term. Although our findings are associative, they highlight the need for further research to clarify the drivers of poor outcomes. In the interim, practical strategies such as leveraging technology to reduce ischemic time during transfers and implementing emergency department-based activation protocols for ALI may help address current care delays."

    "abstract": "Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) is a critical condition resulting from increased intra-compartmental pressure, causing tissue ischemia and necrosis. ACS following cardiovascular surgery is rare but catastrophic. Postoperative sedation and analgesia often obscure classic symptoms, delaying diagnosis. This underscores the importance of vigilance and early detection, particularly in high-risk scenarios such as prolonged extracorporeal circulation and femoral artery cannulation. Enhanced monitoring, including tissue oxygen saturation and transcutaneous oxygen pressure, may facilitate timely diagnosis. We report a 56-year-old male who developed ACS after valve replacement surgery involving femoral artery cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass. Approximately 12 h postoperatively, the patient exhibited severe lower limb swelling, mottling, and diminished dorsalis pedis pulse. Laboratory findings revealed elevated myoglobin and creatine kinase levels. Diagnosis was confirmed via clinical and ultrasound evaluation, prompting emergent fasciotomy. Postoperative management included wound care, renal replacement therapy, and skin flap reconstruction. At 6 months follow-up, the patient achieved complete functional recovery of the affected limb. ACS is a rare but severe complication of cardiovascular surgery. This case highlights the necessity for heightened vigilance, early recognition, and timely intervention to mitigate adverse outcomes. Further studies are needed to validate and establish standardized monitoring protocols and management strategies, including early use of distal perfusion techniques, to improve surgical safety and patient outcomes."

Imaging revealed an extensive Stanford type B aortic dissection (TBAD) involving the thoracoabdominal aorta and iliac arteries, with significantly impaired perfusion of the left leg. Due to the severity of limb ischemia and limitations to immediate endovascular repair, an urgent right-to-left femoro-femoral bypass was performed as a limb-saving procedure. Postoperatively, the patient developed multiorgan complications, including acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring hemodialysis and bowel ischemia, which were managed conservatively. The definitive repair of the dissection was achieved through thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). Several weeks later, the patient presented with a gradually enlarging, painless, pulsatile mass in the right antecubital fossa, corresponding to a prior arterial access site. Clinical features, including a palpable thrill and audible bruit, were consistent with an iatrogenic arteriovenous fistula (AVF), which was surgically excised with the preservation of arterial flow and uneventful recovery. This case underscores the complex and life-threatening course of complicated type B aortic dissection with peripheral malperfusion, the necessity of staged hybrid management, and the importance of long-term follow-up for detecting delayed iatrogenic complications associated with endovascular procedures."

Pulmonary embolisms (PEs) resulting from deep venous thrombosis (DVT) are uncommon. Herein, we report an important case in which a critical PE developed in a patient after emergency endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) for a ruptured AAA. Notably, the patient's life was saved through cardiac surgery without compromising his activities of daily living. A 64-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a ruptured AAA and a massive right retroperitoneal hematoma. We performed emergency EVAR, and an open abdomen and temporary abdominal closure technique. On post-operative day 5, he experienced sudden cardiac arrest due to PE caused by DVT. An emergency pulmonary artery thrombectomy was performed. The abdomen was opened again and the retroperitoneal hematoma was removed. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged without sequelae. The thrombus formation was considered to have been caused by an aneurysm and a retroperitoneal hematoma that compressed the inferior vena cava. If a ruptured AAA protrudes toward the right side and is associated with a large right-sided hematoma, clinicians might have to consider removing the hematoma simultaneously via EVAR."

A 69-year-old male with a history of stage IIIb small cell lung cancer developed severe HIT (platelet count nadir, 11 × 10⁹/L) after receiving heparin for stroke prophylaxis, complicated by deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and acute limb ischemia (ALI). Despite treatment with fondaparinux, thrombocytopenia secondary to HIT persisted, and his arterial thrombosis progressed, leading to urgent angioplasty and thrombectomy. This clinical course raised concerns for autoimmune HIT (aHIT) refractory to fondaparinux or potential fondaparinux cross-reactivity.

Lower extremity PAD is an atherosclerotic disease that causes obstruction of blood vessels supplying the legs, presenting as intermittent claudication, rest pain, non - healing wounds, ulcers, or gangrene, and may lead to limb amputation or death due to critical limb ischemia. Our analysis covers prevalence, incidence, mortality, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability - adjusted life years (DALYs). A key finding of this study is from the Age - period - cohort (APC) analysis. It shows that age and period effects are risk factors for the incidence and mortality of PAD, while birth cohort effects have a protective role. Additionally, projections using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model indicate that the risk of death from PAD will increase for males in the future. Through Joinpoint regression analysis, we delineate the temporal trends. Considering China's aging population, the growing disease burden from economic progress, and the rapidly changing healthcare landscape, these findings highlight the escalating challenge of PAD. The study's predictions serve as a warning of the continued rise in PAD incidence and emphasize the urgent need for public health interventions to address the increasing burden."

Its increased use since the launch of the Stop the Bleed campaign, however, has raised concerns regarding possible complications associated with its application, including limb ischemia and amputation. The objective of this study was to synthesize the existing evidence regarding complications associated with the use of tourniquets for extremity injuries and identify gaps in knowledge to guide future research on this topic. A review of the literature between 2016 and 2024 was performed including open access retrospective studies, case series, clinical cases, and systematic reviews that addressed tourniquet use in a civilian or military setting in patients with extremity injuries, following the PRISMA-ScR 2018 checklist. PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane databases were queried, identifying 1,398 articles on the use of extremity tourniquets in military and civilian contexts, focusing on complications. Of these, 1,343 articles were excluded due to duplication or irrelevance based on the title. From the 55 remaining, 37 were excluded after abstract review for not meeting inclusion criteria. Of the 18 full-text articles reviewed, 10 were excluded due to insufficient data, leaving 8 studies for detailed analysis. Prolonged application in emergency situations may lead to severe complications, such as nerve injuries, post-tourniquet syndrome and thromboembolic event risks. Nerve palsy has been identified as the most prevalent complication associated with prolonged tourniquet use. Improved training is essential to help providers accurately assess bleeding severity and apply appropriate interventions, reducing complications and enhancing outcomes. Future research opportunities should consider: (1) prospective interventional randomized controlled studies aiming to compare the use of tourniquets to different methods of hemorrhage control; (2) development and validation of easy-to-use scores predicting complications and the need of amputation in both civilian and military settings including upper and lower extremities, to better guide clinical decisions and future guidelines; (3) development of better ways to teach lay providers to recognize life threatening bleeding; and (4) development of guidelines for timing of tourniquet loosening, removal or conversion."

Without urgent revascularization, patients are at risk of ischemic damage and amputation. This study uses novel proteomic techniques to investigate the molecular architecture of ALI thrombi, identifying key proteins that may influence coagulation dynamics and fibrinolysis resistance. Arterial thromboemboli (n = 12) collected after revascularization procedures were analyzed and compared to in vitro clots (n = 10) generated from healthy donor blood via tissue factor‒induced coagulation. Proteins were identified and quantified via liquid chromatography‒mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A comprehensive literature review of the most abundant proteins allowed for categorization based on their functional roles in fibrinolysis, red blood cell (RBC) degradation, complement activation, and platelet activation. Compared to in vitro clots, ALI clots contained 141 proteins with significantly increased abundance (fold change) and 38 with decreased abundance (p < 0.05). These include 17 fibrinolysis regulators, 8 RBC-related proteins, 6 complement proteins, and 36 platelet regulators. The antifibrinolytic protein vitronectin (VTN) was strikingly enriched (1067-fold), suggesting a substantial role in fibrinolysis resistance and clot stability. Scavengers of heme/hemoglobin, thromboinflammatory complement proteins, and platelet activators were highly abundant. This proof-of-concept study introduces novel proteomic methods for arterial thrombus analysis and identifies key proteins involved in ALI pathology. Our findings reveal a delicate balance between antifibrinolytic and profibrinolytic proteins, offering potential therapeutic targets to enhance thrombolysis and improve ALI management."

When surgical thrombectomy using a Fogarty catheter is not feasible, the DISASTER technique represents a viable and effective endovascular treatment strategy. A 51-year-old woman presented with the sudden onset of bilateral lower extremity pain and coldness. She had been receiving estrogen therapy for irregular menstruation. Angiography revealed a claw sign in the distal superficial femoral artery. She declined surgical thrombectomy due to concerns about invasiveness. Catheter-directed thrombectomy and thrombus aspiration were performed using the DISASTER (Diamond-Shaped wire Accelerate Splicing process of Thrombus used for Emergent Revascularization) technique. Ultrasound examination identified a thrombus distal to the left common femoral vein. Anticoagulation therapy with a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) was initiated. Comprehensive hematological testing revealed no evidence of an underlying coagulopathy. Additionally, no intracardiac thrombus or valvular vegetations were detected. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) identified a Grade 2 patent foramen ovale (PFO), suggesting paradoxical embolism as the likely etiology. The patient remained free of thromboembolic events postoperatively. This report highlights the feasibility of catheter-directed thrombectomy and thrombus aspiration as an effective alternative to surgical intervention for acute limb ischemia. In cases of ALI of unknown etiology, paradoxical embolism should be suspected. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation, including venous ultrasound and transesophageal echocardiography, is essential to identify a potential PFO or other embolic sources. Early recognition and appropriate management of paradoxical embolism may help prevent recurrent thromboembolic events and improve patient outcomes."

Given the burden of ACVS at our institution, we have transitioned from a traditional \"on call\" model to a \"Surgeon of the Week\" (SOW) model, in which a single surgeon covers all daytime inpatient consults and resultant operations over the course of a week. The SOW surgeon has no overnight call, outpatient clinic, and minimizes elective operations during this week, enabling dedicated care to inpatient responsibilities. In this study, we report our 2-year experience with the SOW model for ACVS. Institutional medical records were retrospectively queried for all operations performed by the SOW surgeon at a single academic medical center from 2023 to 2024. The 1-year SOW period was then compared with the antecedent 5-year period from 2018 to 2023 (pre-SOW) to evaluate care delivery metrics. A total of six vascular surgeons covered 51 weeks as the SOW over the study period. The SOW surgeon performed a total of 598 cases, averaging a median of 11.5 cases per week (interquartile range [IQR], 9-14 cases per week). The median weekly operative time was 28.6 hours (IQR, 21.0-33.5 hours). The most common indications for primary vascular operations included acute limb ischemia (n = 31), aortic disease (n = 44), carotid disease (n = 32), hemodialysis access (n = 71), major amputations (n = 112), mesenteric ischemia (n = 23), peripheral artery disease (n = 105), and wound complications (n = 87). Urgent and emergent procedures comprised 21.7% of all operations. An additional 61 intraoperative consultations were requested from 14 other surgical services over the study period. Compared with the pre-SOW period, preoperative length of stay for inpatient operations was shorter in the SOW period (2 days [IQR, 0-7 days] vs 3 days [IQR, 1-8 days]; P < .0001). Elective case cancellations (4.0% vs 3.7%; P = .55) and the proportion of weekend operations (8.3% vs 8.1%; P = .75) were similar between periods. In this study, we report our experience following implementation of the SOW model at a tertiary academic medical center. This alternative model for ACVS coverage enabled the SOW to perform a wide breadth of primary vascular operations and provide intraoperative assistance to many other surgical services, without being encumbered by competing responsibilities. Furthermore, the SOW model was associated with more efficient delivery of inpatient care, as reflected in a reduced time-to-operating room. Other medical centers with similar, high-volume ACVS responsibilities may also benefit from implementing a SOW model."

    "abstract": "Lower-limb ischemia-reperfusion injury (LL-IRI) is a frequent and serious complication following reperfusion therapy for lower-limb arterial occlusion. It can be caused by trauma, arterial stenosis, thrombotic occlusion, and atherosclerosis. As a prevalent peripheral vascular disease, LL-IRI results in local tissue damage and triggers systemic inflammatory responses that can lead to multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome, as well as multiorgan failure and death in severe cases. Despite its clinical significance, the mechanisms underlying IRI remain poorly understood, and no specific targeted drugs or effective emergency interventions are currently available. Therefore, this review provides a comprehensive analysis of the domestic and international literature published over the past decade regarding the disease definition, pathogenesis, and therapeutic advances in LL-IRI. It summarizes current pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, including antioxidant stress management, anti-inflammatory approaches, and oxidative stress reduction strategies. This review aims to advance the exploration of LL-IRI pathogenesis and proposes novel therapeutic perspectives for innovative drug development."

    "abstract": "Outcomes in acute limb ischemia (ALI) depend on early recognition. Rapid evaluation methods in the emergency department (ED) include physical exam, hand-held Doppler (HH), or spectral Doppler (SD) using point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). This study aims to estimate performance characteristics of HH versus emergency medicine (EM)-performed SD compared to angiography along with clinician confidence when evaluating for ALI. This was a prospective observational pilot study. A convenience sample of patients presenting to an urban, academic ED with concern for ALI who underwent angiography were eligible. The primary aim evaluated diagnostic performance of HH and SD in correctly classifying flow in posterior tibial (PT) and dorsalis pedis (DP) arteries in patients with 100% angiographic occlusion of the proximal vasculature. Binomial exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and Fisher's exact tests were used. Twenty-six patients were enrolled. Three cases (11.5% of 26) had normal angiography, five (19.2%) had partial occlusion, and 18 (69.2%) had 100% occlusion. For cases with 100% occlusion, HH always classified PT or DP as abnormal (sensitivity 100, 95% CI 81.5-100%). SD also showed high sensitivity (94.4, 95% CI 72.7-99.9%). Limited utility of specificity calculations was due to low true negatives (n = 3), but these measures were low for HH (66.7, 95% CI 9.4-99.2%) and SD (33.3, 95% CI 0.8-90.6%). There was no association (p = .305) between sonographer confidence and correct diagnostic classification for either HH or SD. In a patient population with suspected ALI, EM-performed HH and SD performed extremely well at identifying abnormal PT or DP flow in patients with complete (100%) angiographic occlusion. These results are useful to power larger trials to determine the role that SD may play in complementing HH evaluation for ALI."

    "abstract": "Objectives: The venous cuff technique has been used primarily for arterial bypass using artificial grafts to the lower extremities. The boat-form vein cuff was designed to allow adjustment of the size and angle of the anastomosis at any anatomic site. We report our experience and outcomes of the original vein cuff technique in various peripheral artery bypass grafting procedures. Methods: A total of 10 patients underwent arterial bypass grafting using a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft with a boat-form venous cuff. The indications for the surgery consisted of peripheral artery disease (n = 4), acute limb ischemia (n = 4), chronic mesenteric ischemia (n = 1), and traumatic upper limb ischemia (n = 1). Five patients required emergency surgery. Surgical outcomes, such as mortality and morbidity, limb salvage rate, and graft patency, were examined using perioperative and postoperative follow-up data. Results: There were no operative deaths or serious complications, including amputation of the lower extremity. During the follow-up period (44 ± 36.9 months), the PTFE graft remained patent in 9 patients (90%). In 1 patient, occlusion of the femoropopliteal bypass graft was observed 3 months after surgery. Conclusions: The simple design and creation of the boat-form vein cuff are useful at any anatomical site in peripheral artery bypass grafting with a PTFE graft."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia of the upper extremity is an uncommon but emergent clinical scenario, in which both revascularization and decompressive fasciotomy may be indicated to optimize patient outcomes. The purpose of this study was to examine operative exposure to upper extremity fasciotomy among surgical trainees across different specialties. Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education national data reports were reviewed for operative volumes as reported by vascular surgery integrated residents (VSRs), vascular surgery fellows (VSFs), orthopedic surgery residents (OSRs), and hand surgery fellows (HSFs). Data were analyzed via univariate tests and linear regression analysis for trends. From 2013 to 2022, HSF graduates performed a mean of 51.7 ± 6.4 upper extremity fasciotomy procedures, and OSR graduates performed 6.0 ± 0.7 fasciotomy procedures (P < 0.0001 versus HSF). Over the same time period, both VSF and VSR reported zero upper extremity fasciotomy procedures performed at time of graduation (P < 0.0001 each versus HSF). OSR graduates also reported 42.7 ± 7.9 carpal tunnel release procedures, with an annual increase of 2.5 ± 0.3 cases on linear regression analysis (R2 = 0.89, P < 0.0001). Neither OSR (annual trend, 0.1 ± 0.1 cases/year, R2 = 0.18, P = 0.18) nor HSF groups (annual trend, 0.0 ± 0.1 cases/year, R2 = 0.01, P = 0.83) experienced a decline in upper extremity fasciotomy operations performed over the 10-year study period. Revascularization procedures were performed by VSR (4.3 ± 0.7 cases), VSF (3.5 ± 0.6 cases), and HSF (15.1 ± 1.2 cases) groups. Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education data reports did not report data on upper extremity revascularization procedures performed by OSR graduates. Vascular operations of the upper extremity remain an integral component of surgical training across multiple specialties; however, vascular surgical trainees have minimal operative exposure to upper extremity fasciotomy. These data underscore the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to patients presenting with acute limb ischemia of the upper extremity."

    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is a life-threatening vascular emergency that requires immediate intervention to restore perfusion and prevent limb loss or mortality. Management strategies primarily include thrombolysis and surgical revascularization, each with distinct risks and benefits. This review evaluates and compares the outcomes of thrombolysis and surgical revascularization in ALI management, emphasizing their efficacy, safety, and patient selection criteria. Materials and Methods: A systematic review was conducted in adherence to PRISMA guidelines, analyzing data from 15 studies, including randomized controlled trials and large retrospective analyses, encompassing over 3500 patients with varying demographics and clinical presentations. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results: Thrombolysis, utilizing agents such as urokinase or recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), demonstrated limb salvage rates up to 90% in acute cases, with 30-day mortality rates of 4-6%. It was particularly effective in patients with embolic occlusions or short symptom durations. However, bleeding complications associated with thrombolysis were reported in up to 47% of cases. Conversely, surgical revascularization remains crucial for those with advanced ischemia or contraindications to thrombolysis, offering reliable perfusion restoration but with higher perioperative morbidity, especially in older patients with significant comorbidities. Recent advancements, including hybrid approaches combining catheter-directed thrombolysis with percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy, have shown promise in improving outcomes by reducing procedure times and enhancing clot resolution. Conclusions: While thrombolysis and surgical revascularization are effective, optimizing patient selection remains a key challenge. Future research should focus on refining treatment algorithms, investigating novel thrombolytic agents, and expanding the role of minimally invasive techniques to improve long-term outcomes while mitigating complications such as bleeding and reperfusion injuries."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia is a serious vascular emergency that can result in severe impairment, limb loss, and significant fatality rates. Patient was admitted with impending gangrene and dusky discolouration with loss of pain sensation & movement below the knee. Satisfactory improvement in postoperative follow-up. A 46-year-old female was admitted with complaints of impending gangrene. After that, leg discolouration appeared with a rapid course of the disease in the last 10-14 days. It is a case of acute limb ischemia with a non-palpable common femoral artery. Hence, ipsilateral thromboembolectomy was planned as an emergency on the right side of the leg as a measure of revascularisation. The right common femoral artery was opened, and thrombus was extracted out. After that flow is established, distal vessels become palpable. The patient was put on low molecular weight heparin (subcutaneously), and 60 mg was given to prevent any clot formation & thromboembolism as well. If there is any short history of critical ischemia & gangrene, it is not settled enough. We should go for thromboembolectomy at the earliest for re-establishment of the vasculature of the area together with higher injectable antibiotics & other supportive measures to prevent anticipated re-perfusion injury to multiple organs. Almost lost right leg is saved."

    "abstract": "Simultaneous acute limb ischemia (ALI) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are extremely rare, with the current literature providing a limited understanding of shared mechanisms. We report a rare case of concurrent ALI and PE presentation in a patient with a history of repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), emphasizing the possible association between congenital heart disease and thromboembolic risk, potentially through residual hemodynamic abnormalities or arrhythmias. The case involves a 48-year-old male with a history of TOF repair in childhood who developed simultaneous ALI and PE approximately 48 years after the surgical repair. The patient presented with sudden right lower extremity pain and swelling; was classified as Rutherford IIa ALI; and underwent urgent endovascular revascularization that included an overnight tissue plasminogen activator infusion and a relook angiogram the next day. During admission, the common embolic etiologies of his presentation were excluded by multiple investigations, including transthoracic echocardiography, thrombophilia panel, and occult malignancy screens. Although the patient had multiple cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity, smoking, and hypertension, it is most likely the history of TOF repair that contributed the most to the concurrent thromboembolic presentation, especially given that TOF repair has been reported to be associated with chronic complications in adult patients, such as persistent right ventricular dysfunction and arrhythmias. A multidisciplinary team of interventional cardiologists, pulmonologists, and hematologists managed the case, reflecting the difficulty of managing concomitant thromboembolic events and monitoring and evaluating thromboembolic risk factors for treated congenital heart disease, most specifically TOF, in adult patients."

Final angiography showed the right external iliac artery occlusion due to vascular injury related to a large-diameter introducer sheath. Although we performed endovascular therapy, no guidewires could cross the culprit lesion because the intima had frapped and occluded the vessel lumen. Therefore, we performed femoro-femoral bypass for bailout of acute limb ischemia. Femoro-femoral bypass is a less invasive, shorter operation time and therefore a reasonable strategy as an urgent bailout for vascular complications during TAVI in super-aged or higher-risk surgical patients with severe AS."

    "abstract": "Background: Patients having emergency surgery due to ischemia caused by a popliteal artery aneurysm (PAA) have worse outcomes in all endpoints (operation time, major adverse limb events (MALE), amputation-free survival) than after elective treatment, mostly due to a limited crural vessel runoff. This study investigates the relationship between PAA diameter, volume, and luminal thrombus load in relation to the preoperative crural runoff. Patients and methods: Retrospective single-centre evaluation of surgically treated patients with PAA and semi-automated quantitative CT analysis of PAA morphologies (diameter, volume and intraluminal thrombus volume). Primary endpoints were the correlations these characteristics with the number of patent crural vessels. Results: A total of 89 PAAs (61 patients, median age 75, IQR 12; 94.4% male) were identified, of which 47.2% were symptomatic with 18 acute limb ischemia (ALI). The diameter at surgery was 33.8 ± 12.1mm and the volume 68.5 ± 13.6mm3. A median of two lower leg vessels were patent (elective 3 [1, 2, 3] vs. emergency 1 [1, 2], p=0.1) upon preoperative CTA. 77 PAAs underwent elective surgery, five PAAs (5.6%) received endovascular treatment. The surgical complication rate was 23.6% without immediate or early occlusion. The follow-up was 42.5 [39-45] months. The overall mortality rate was 11.2% and the primary patency rate 73.9%. While the total aneurysm volume correlated well with the diameter (r=0.77, p<0.01), the intraluminal thrombus volume (ILT) showed the clearest correlation with the crural runoff (r=-0.34, p=0.01). No correlation between the diameter and crural runoff was observed (r=-0.17, p=0.1). A reduced crural run-off was significantly associated with impaired amputation-free survival (p=0.01). A subgroup analysis (n=21) with sequential CTs showed a tendency towards greater increase of thrombus volume compared to plain diameter during PAA growth. The thrombus volume index (=ILT/total PAA volume) was significantly higher in emergency patients (p=0.01), while diameters tended to be smaller (p=0.57). Conclusions: The increasing intraluminal thrombus volume correlates most distinctly with a reduced crural runoff in PAAs and should therefore be considered prognostically important, especially in the presence of an increased growth rate compared to the diameter."

    "abstract": "Acute lower limb ischemia (ALI) is a vascular emergency requiring prompt intervention to prevent limb loss and mortality. Treatment strategies have evolved from open surgical revascularization (OSR) and thrombolysis-dominated endovascular therapy (EVT) with advanced thrombectomy devices and hybrid approaches, yet optimal management remains debated. PROMOTE-ALI (Prospective Multicentre Observational Study Evaluating Acute Lower Limb Ischaemia) evaluates contemporary treatment practices, factors influencing modality selection, and short-term outcomes in ALI across Europe. The PROMOTE-ALI registry included patients from December 1, 2021, to August 31, 2023. The primary end point was identifying preoperative predictors influencing treatment choice. Secondary end points included 30-day and 90-day amputation-free survival (AFS), freedom from target limb reintervention, clinical outcomes, complications, and survival. Predictors of treatment were analyzed with generalized linear mixed model with random intercept for inclusion site. Kaplan-Meier analysis evaluated the probability for AFS, freedom from major amputation, and survival. Among 705 cases, OSR (55.7%) was the predominant treatment, followed by hybrid (20.9%) and EVT (19.1%). Completion angiography was performed in 50.1% of OSR cases, significantly reducing reintervention rates (6.16% vs 13.52%; P = .02). EVT and hybrid therapy were favored in patients with peripheral artery disease (60.0% and 60.5% vs 46.3% OSR; P = .05 and P = .03) and prior ipsilateral revascularizations (57.8% and 48.3% vs 32.1%; P < .001 and P < .02). OSR was preferred in patients with cardiac dysrhythmia (38.4% vs 16.3% EVT and 13.6% hybrid; P = .004 and P = .002). EVT patients had higher reintervention (32.6%) and bleeding rates (5.2%) compared with OSR (8.9%, 1.0%) and hybrid therapy (15.0%, 1.4%; P < .001 and P = .01). This study highlights evolving ALI treatment patterns in Europe. Patient characteristics, disease etiology, and procedural factors significantly influence ALI treatment selection. Although OSR remains essential, hybrid techniques address complex lesions, and EVT is preferred in failed prior revascularizations, although with higher reintervention risks. Comparable AFS across modalities underscores the importance of individualized approaches and refinement of treatment protocols to optimize outcomes."

    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Hind limb ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a serious clinical condition that requires urgent treatment and develops as a result of a sudden decrease in blood flow in the extremity. Antioxidant combinations are frequently used in diseases today. This study aimed to investigate and compare the effectiveness of ellagic acid (EA) and berberine (BER), which are important antioxidants, and the combination on hind limb I/R injury to evaluate their therapeutic power. Materials and Methods: Thirty-five male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups: sham, I/R, EA+I/R, BER+I/R, and EA/BER+I/R. In the I/R procedure, the infrarenal abdominal aorta was clamped and reperfused for 2 h. EA (100 mg/kg, ip) and BER (200 mg/kg, ip) were administered in the 75th minute of ischemia. Oxidative stress markers (MDA, GSH, SOD, and CAT) and TNF-α were measured. Apoptosis (Bax, Bcl-2, and Cleaved caspase-3) and pyroptosis (Nrf2, NLRP3, and Gasdermin D) pathways were evaluated via Western blot. Muscle tissue was examined histopathologically by hematoxylin eosin staining. One-way ANOVA and post hoc LSD tests were applied for statistical analyses (p < 0.05). Results: Bax levels increased in the ischemia group and decreased with EA and BER (p < 0.05). Bcl-2 levels decreased in the ischemia group but increased with EA and BER (p < 0.05). The highest level of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was in the I/R group (p < 0.05). Cleaved caspase 3 was higher in the other groups compared to the sham group (p < 0.05). While Nrf2 decreased in the I/R group, NLRP3 and Gasdermin D increased; EA and BER normalized these levels (p < 0.05). In the histopathological analysis, a combination of EA and BER reduced damage (p < 0.05). TNF-α levels were similar between groups (p > 0.05). MDA levels were reduced by EA and BER, but GSH, SOD, and CAT levels were increased (p < 0.05). Conclusions: It was concluded that TNF-α levels depend on the degree and duration of inflammation and that no difference was found in relation to duration in this study. As a result, EA, BER, and their combination could be potential treatment agents on hind limb I/R injury with these positive effects."

Open repair remains preferred for complex type C and D lesions despite endovascular options. This study evaluated long-term outcomes of open surgical repair in acute and chronic AIOD. A single-centre, retrospective analysis was conducted on patients undergoing open AIOD repair (January 2010-December 2020). Primary outcomes included 30-day and long-term mortality; secondary outcomes were graft patency, Rutherford classification improvement, and limb salvage. Seventy-six patients (61% male; mean age 62 ± 10 years) underwent open repair for Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) II type D AIOD. Peripheral arterial disease and prior interventions were common (67 patients, 88%). Elective surgery was performed in 49 patients (64%), while 27 patients (36%) underwent urgent procedures. The 30-day mortality rate was 0% (0/49) for elective cases but 19% (5/27) for urgent cases (P < 0.01). Long-term survival rates at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years were 98% (48/49), 96% (47/49), 94% (46/49), and 86% (42/49) for elective cases versus 78% (21/27), 62% (17/27), 62% (17/27), and 62% (17/27) for urgent cases (P = 0.30), respectively. Elective cases demonstrated high graft patency at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years (96% [47/49], 90% [44/49], 90% [44/49], and 85% [42/49]), respectively. Rutherford classification improved significantly (median preoperative stage 3 to postoperative stage 0, P < 0.001), with stable ankle-brachial index (ABI) values (≥0.9) in 59 of 61 patients (97%). Vascular complications occurred in 39 patients (51%), with reinterventions in 12 patients (16%). Sustained limb salvage was observed over long-term follow-up (median 59 months). Open repair for complex AIOD offers durable outcomes, with low elective case mortality and high limb salvage and graft patency. Future studies should explore long-term comparative outcomes."

    "abstract": "Acute Limb Ischemia (ALI) is a vascular emergency which is accompanied by a significant risk of limb loss or even death. Rapid restoration of arterial perfusion using surgical and/or endovascular techniques is crucial for limb salvage. Undeniably, an accurate and prompt diagnosis is the first step to improve patient prognosis. The typical clinical presentation is not always present and the variety of symptoms may result in non-vascular specialists missing the diagnosis. In this single-center retrospective descriptive study, we reviewed all patients hospitalized between January 2018 and January 2024 for ALI. Patients who were initially misdiagnosed, causing a delayed diagnosis > 24 h, and who therefore did not receive timely treatment, were identified. Moreover, patients with a timely diagnosis of ALI who were treated in our institution during the same time period were collected. Among 280 ALI patients, 14 were initially misdiagnosed. The median time from initial symptoms to definite diagnosis was 38.8 days (range 1.5-365). Several specialties such as orthopedic surgeons, neurologists, and general practitioners were involved in patients' initial assessment. Three patients underwent primary amputation due to irreversible ALI, while nine underwent revascularization and one conservative treatment. Thirty-day limb salvage rate was 9/14 and thirty-day mortality was observed in one patient. Secondary interventions were needed in 65% of these cases. Patients with a delayed ALI diagnosis, when compared to those with a timely diagnosis, presented a significantly lower limb salvage rate (65% vs. 89%, p-value = 0.02) and a significantly higher rate of reinterventions (65% vs. 18%, p-value < 0.001). Many patients with ALI are primarily referred to non-vascular specialties. Misdiagnosed and mistreated ALI negatively affects outcomes."

    "abstract": "VenoArterial (VA)-ExtraCorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) decannulation was traditionally performed surgically, often resulting in high rates of periprocedural complications such as surgical site infections, bleeding, and elevated patient mobilization costs. The advent of percutaneous techniques, particularly the MANTA® vascular closure device (MVCD), has significantly reduced these risks by enabling faster and safer decannulation. This study aimed to systematically review the success rates and complications associated with the use of percutaneous closure devices for VA-ECMO decannulation. Therefore, this systematic review with meta-analysis aims to evaluate the success rates and complications associated with the use of MVCD device for VA-ECMO decannulation. A systematic search was conducted across Pubmed, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases to identify studies evaluating postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing VA-ECMO decannulation using the MANTA® vascular closure device. The MANTA® efficacy, incidence of emergent open repair, arterial thrombosis, acute limb ischemia, pseudoaneurysms, and major bleeding were pooled by fixed-effects meta-analysis, with sources of heterogeneity being explored by meta-regression. Assessment of studies' quality was performed using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Study Quality Assessment Tool for observational cohorts and case-series studies. Seven observational studies with 235 patients were included in the final analysis. Overall efficacy of MVCD in VA-ECMO decannulation was 94.8% (95% CI 91.8%-97.9%). In 235 patients, the incidence of emergency open repair after MVCD failure was 3.7% (95% CI 1.3%-6.1%), the incidence of arterial thrombosis was 7.1% (95% CI 2.9%-11.3%), the incidence of pseudoaneurysms was 3.2% (95% CI 0.9%-5.5%), the incidence of acute limb ischemia was 5.0% (95% CI 2.3%-7.8%), and the incidence of major arterial bleeding was 4.1% (95% CI 1.6%-6.7%). This systematic review and meta-analysis highlights the safety and efficacy of the MANTA® vascular closure device in achieving hemostasis following VA-ECMO decannulation, demonstrating an acceptable success rate and a low incidence of major complications. Further studies with larger cohorts are necessary to validate these findings and to address the limitations of this preliminary experience."

    "abstract": "Rhabdomyolysis is a clinical syndrome resulting from skeletal muscle damage and the release of its breakdown products into the bloodstream. It can range from asymptomatic cases to severe conditions such as acute kidney injury. Although the release of myoglobin (molecular weight 17.2 kDa) into the blood is associated with the progression to acute kidney injury, there is no established method to prevent it. Here, we report a case of hypermyoglobinemia due to rhabdomyolysis caused by reperfusion injury following acute limb ischemia, where early renal replacement therapy was deemed effective. The patient, a 73-year-old Japanese male, had a history of right nephrectomy due to trauma. At 2 years prior, he underwent bypass surgery connecting the subclavian artery to the bilateral femoral arteries to treat lower limb arteriosclerotic occlusive disease. In this case, he presented to another hospital with sudden right lower limb pain and was referred to our hospital with a diagnosis of acute occlusion of the right lower extremity artery. After emergency endovascular thrombectomy, hemodiafiltration was initiated on the second day due to rhabdomyolysis and hypermyoglobinemia. The patient developed compartment syndrome in the affected limb and underwent an emergency fasciotomy. Despite a further increase in myoglobin levels, his urine output remained stable, and creatinine levels stayed within the normal range. On the 6th day of admission, he was successfully weaned off hemodiafiltration. Following negative pressure wound treatment for compartment syndrome, a skin graft was performed, and the wound was closed. The patient was transferred for rehabilitation on the 35th day. This case illustrates that early initiation of blood purification therapy can prevent the progression of acute kidney injury triggered by hypermyoglobinemia in rhabdomyolysis. Early intervention with intermittent hemodiafiltration may effectively prevent renal failure in such cases."

Although the presence of a cardiac thrombus is a major risk factor for embolization, several probable conditions, the connection of which is not thoroughly studied, such as gout disease and methamphetamine abuse, are also possible causes. We present the case report of a male in his early 40s with a history of alcohol and methamphetamine abuse, gout, and dilated cardiomyopathy, experiencing multiple ischemic attacks, including acute limb ischemia, dysarthria, and renal infarct. Echocardiography revealed a large clot in the left ventricle. The patient received heparin at a rate of 1000 units/hour, followed by warfarin at 10 mg/day, and probenecid at 500 mg/day. The thrombus resolved upon anticoagulant therapy, with improvement in the patient's symptoms. Left ventricular thrombus formation in dilated cardiomyopathy is influenced by many factors, including drug toxicity (for instance, methamphetamine), uric acid levels, and N-terminal precursor B-type natriuretic peptide. The thrombus can cause cardioembolic attacks in multiple sites, and the choice for emergent therapy is an oral anticoagulant, which may improve the ejection fraction. However, certain aspects related to cardiac thrombosis and embolization risk still warrant more comprehensive studies."

    "abstract": "A 69-year-old male diagnosed with subacute myocardial infarction was subsequently transferred to our institution. Upon admission, echocardiography revealed ventricular septal rupture (VSR). The patient was promptly supported via venoarterial (VA) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and Impella CP before surgical VSR repair on the 12th day of admission. Following surgery, the patient decided to be transferred to the intensive care unit under new VA-ECMO assistance. Subsequently, Impella CP removal and arterial cannula reinsertion were performed at the ipsilateral site, with no pulsatile bleeding observed from the arterial cannulation site. Emergency aortography revealed a contrast defect at the terminal aorta. Owing to the possibility of acute thrombotic occlusion, the Fogarty procedure was performed through the bilateral common femoral artery (CFA); however, no thrombus retrieved. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed complete occlusion of the bilateral common iliac arteries, extending to the abdominal aorta. The uncontrollable, rapid progression of acidemia resulted in sudden cardiac arrest. Acute arterial occlusion leading to fatal outcomes can occur because of thrombosis following long-term Impella CP use. Impella-associated thrombi can form around the shaft of a mixed area of blood flow caused by the interaction between Impella and ECMO and often develop distal to the aortic arch, which is often overlooked during routine examinations. Therefore, planning for long-term Impella with ECMO support must utilize various imaging modalities to search for thrombi and prepare several means of revascularization during Impella removal."

    "abstract": "Acute lower extremity limb ischemia (ALI) is a common vascular surgery emergency, primarily caused by embolism or atherosclerotic in situ thrombosis-acute on chronic limb ischemia (AoCLI). This study aimed to examine the clinical features and treatment challenges of AoCLI. Between January 2014 and December 2022, 73 patients with AoCLI (n=35) or embolic ALI (n=38) were analyzed. The time from ALI onset was significantly longer (P<0.01), and the rate of contralateral diseases was higher in AoCLI than embolic ALI (P<0.01). Treatment and intraoperative findings showed higher rates of failed thrombectomy (P=0.027), difficulty in crossing lesions (P<0.01), defined as failure of Fogarty catheter crossing despite guidewire navigation and requirement of the balloon angioplasty for the lesions, additional revascularization (P<0.01), and multi-segment treatment (P<0.01) in AoCLI. In multivariate analysis, unfavorable factors for endovascular therapy (EVT) were >2.5 days from ALI onset (odds ratio [OR] 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-2.0), non-atrial fibrillation (OR 4.2; 95% CI 1.0-16.7), and collateral development (OR 9.0; 95% CI 1.0-81.5). Rates of failed EVT were 0% for no factors, 18% for 1 factor, 43% for 2 factors, and 90% for 3 factors. AoCLI had more complex and multi-segment arterial lesions, making limb perfusion restoration difficult. The unfavorable factors for EVT could help stratify the optimal treatment of ALI in emergency settings."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to create a risk score for 30-day and 1-year mortality after major lower extremity amputation to facilitate clinical expectations and the identification of patients in need of heightened vigilance in longitudinal care. In the Vascular Quality Initiative, 25,150 patients were identified who underwent lower extremity amputation. Two primary outcomes were investigated: 30-day mortality after major lower extremity amputation and 1-year mortality after amputation. Univariable analysis for the 30-day and 1-year mortality analysis was conducted with χ2 analysis. Significant (P < .05) univariable factors were then included in binary logistic regression analysis to perform multivariable investigation toward the outcomes. Variables that achieved multivariable significance (P < .05) for the outcomes were then used in the respective risk scores with the regression beta coefficient being used to weigh the variables. Overall, 7.2% of patients experienced 30-day mortality and 22.4% suffered mortality within 1 year. Variables with a significant multivariable association (P < .05) with 1-year mortality were female sex, advancing age, body mass index less than 20 kg/m2, coronary artery disease, history of coronary revascularization, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dialysis status at presentation, baseline renal insufficiency, anemia, lack of statin medication at presentation, being on anticoagulation at presentation, need for above-knee amputation, and need for emergent amputation. Variables that were protective vs mortality on multivariable analysis (P < .05) were body mass index greater than 30 kg/m2, history of ipsilateral amputation at a lower level, and history of ipsilateral infrainguinal bypass. Pertinent negatives included all socio-demographic variables including rural living status, insurance status, and area deprivation index home area. Variables with a statistically significant (P < .05) multivariable association with 30-day mortality were female sex, advancing age, history of coronary artery disease, history of prior coronary revascularization, history of CHF, class 3 or 4 CHF, chronic obstructive pulmonary artery disease, dialysis requirement at presentation, baseline renal insufficiency, lack of antiplatelet medication at time of presentation, lack of statin medication at time of presentation, need for above-knee amputation, acute ischemia indication, and need for emergent amputation. Variables that were protective (P < .05) vs 30-day mortality on multivariable analysis were diabetes, prior ipsilateral amputation at a lower level, prior infrainguinal bypass ipsilateral to amputation, prior ipsilateral infrainguinal endovascular revascularization (endovascular or bypass), and prior ipsilateral inflow arterial bypass. For receiver operating curve analysis, the 30-day risk score had an area under the curve of 0.715 and the 1-year risk score analysis 0.722. Hosmer-Lemeshow investigation of the multivariable regressions resulted in an overall accuracy of 92.8% for the 30-day mortality investigation (99% accurate for survival) and 78% overall accuracy on the 1-year mortality risk score (96.8% in predicting survival accurately). This indicates that these models perform far better in determining which patients will survive rather than precisely determining who will experience 1-year mortality. Risk scores for mortality at 30 days and 1 year after major lower extremity amputation have been created that have good accuracy and steep escalation with advancing comorbidity. Variables with the most potent deleterious effect on survival were renal insufficiency, dialysis requirement, CHF, and need for emergent amputation. Patients who have already been receiving care from vascular specialists at the time of amputation have improved survival vs those without prior arterial interventions or a lower level of amputation. Social determinants of health do not impact survival among patients undergoing major lower extremity amputation at Vascular Quality Initiative centers."

A 53-year-old male patient with severe impact injury in our department was retrospectively analyzed. Crushing injury resulted in femoral artery disconnection of lower limbs, which led to ischemia and traumatic coagulopathy of lower limbs. A blood transfusion device was used to make a shunt for emergency temporary vascular bypass, during which he experienced coagulation disorder, rhabdomyolysis, osteofascial compartment syndrome and wound infection. By supplementing coagulation substrate, correcting coagulation function, strengthening anti-infection, reducing muscle tension through incision and multiple debridement operations, the diagnosis and treatment process of one limb was preserved.

    "abstract": "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an advanced technology that provides short-term life support for patients with severe cardiopulmonary failure based on the principle of cardiopulmonary bypass. However, various complications such as acute limb ischemia, osteofascial compartment syndrome, hemorrhage and thrombosis can also occur. A retrospective analysis was performed on a 58-year-old Han male patient with acute myocardial infarction complicated with cardiogenic shock in our department. After the conventional treatment failed, he received urgent VA-ECMO treatment. During this period, arterial thrombosis occurred repeatedly, improved after anticoagulant and antithrombotic treatment, and finally died due to infection. Acute limb ischemia caused by arteriovenous thrombosis is one of the possible serious complications during ECMO treatment. Prevention of thrombosis and optimization of anticoagulant and antithrombotic regimen are the main therapeutic measures. Anticoagulation is still the main treatment method for venous thrombosis during ECMO treatment. Anti-thrombotic drugs are not routinely given during ECMO, while anti-thrombotic drugs are the primary treatment for high-risk arterial thrombosis risk patients. Therefore, early detection of complications and timely intervention are crucial. Early intervention or surgical operation can reduce the incidence of ischemia,improve the survival rate and reduce the disabling outcome. 体外膜肺氧合（Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, ECMO）是一种基于体外循环原理，为严重心肺功能衰竭患者提供短期生命支持的先进技术，但也可出现急性肢体缺血、骨筋膜室综合征、出血和血栓等多种并发症。现回顾性分析1例58岁汉族男性急性心肌梗死合并心源性休克患者，常规治疗无效后，紧急接受静脉-动脉ECMO（VA-ECMO）治疗，在此期间反复出现动脉血栓，抗凝抗栓治疗后好转，最终因感染死亡。动静脉血栓形成导致急性肢体缺血是ECMO治疗过程中可能出现的严重并发症之一。预防血栓形成和优化抗凝抗栓方案是主要治疗措施。抗凝仍是ECMO过程中静脉血栓形成的主要治疗方法，而ECMO期间不常规抗栓治疗，但对高危动脉血栓形成风险患者抗栓为首要治疗；病情需要时早期介入或外科手术可降低缺血发生率、提高生存率，减少致残结局。."

    "abstract": "Axillary artery cannulation techniques continue to improve and find application throughout cardiac surgery. Yet, early outcomes are poorly documented versus femoral or central arterial cannulation in right minithoracotomy mitral surgery. There were 3,044 consecutive adult patients undergoing mitral valve surgery via right thoracotomy from 1996 to 2022 examined from a prospectively maintained database. Propensity score matching was used to compare outcomes of axillary versus aortic cannulation in 241 matched pairs and axillary versus femoral cannulation in 356 matched pairs. Arterial cannulation was axillary (770 of 3,044; 25%) versus femoral (149 of 3,044; 5%) or central aortic (2,125 of 3,044; 70%). Axillary versus aortic or femoral patients were older (P < 0.001), more often redo (P < 0.001), more urgent (P < 0.001), and had more mitral replacement (P < 0.001) and tricuspid procedures (P < 0.001). After propensity score matching, cannulation groups did not differ in patient characteristics or concurrent surgical procedures. For matched patients, axillary artery cannulation was not independently associated with operative mortality (P = 0.3), postoperative respiratory failure (P = 0.3), perioperative stroke (P = 0.7), renal insufficiency (P = 0.4), pump time (P = 0.6), clamp time (P = 0.2), transfusion (P = 0.5), perioperative length of stay (P = 0.7), or survival (P = 0.6). Axillary cannulation increased operative time by 14 ± 7 min (P = 0.04) versus aortic or femoral artery cannulation. Right axillary artery cannulation is a safe alternative for right minithoracotomy mitral surgery. Advantages may include avoidance of the aorta in reoperations or older patients, avoidance of peripheral atherosclerosis in older patients, and a low incidence of limb ischemia or wound infection. Disadvantages may include longer access time and an additional chest incision."

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) poses a global health challenge, particularly in its advanced stages known as critical limb ischemia (CLI). Conventional treatments often fail to achieve satisfactory outcomes. Patients with CLI face high rates of morbidity and mortality, underscoring the urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies. Recent advancements in biomaterials and biotechnology have positioned biomaterial-based vascularization strategies as promising approaches to improve blood perfusion and ameliorate ischemic conditions in affected tissues. These materials have shown potential to enhance therapeutic outcomes while mitigating toxicity concerns. This work summarizes the current status of PAD and highlights emerging biomaterial-based strategies for its treatment, focusing on functional genes, cells, proteins, and metal ions, as well as their delivery and controlled release systems. Additionally, the limitations associated with these approaches are discussed. This review provides a framework for designing therapeutic biomaterials and offers insights into their potential for clinical translation, contributing to the advancement of PAD treatments."

An 86-year-old female with diabetes and critical limb ischemia presented with sepsis due to right calcaneal gangrene. A structured, comprehensive evaluation by the inpatient PSH service identified perioperative concerns including malnutrition and elevated cardiac risk and led to the discovery of an airway-compromising mass.

Aim of this study was to report outcomes of the endovascular repair of complex aortic (c-AAAs) and thoracoabdominal (TAAAs) aneurysms by T-branch and PDT. All consecutive patients underwent urgent endovascular repair of c-AAAs and TAAAs by T-branch (Cook Medical) and PDT from 2021 to 2023 were analyzed. Technical success (TS), 30-day mortality, and TA instability within 30 days and 1 year, as well as reinterventions, were assessed as primary endpoints. Time of intraoperative pelvic/lower limb ischemia, spinal cord ischemia (SCI), and perioperative stroke were assessed as secondary endpoints. Thirty-three cases were analyzed. There were six type I endoleaks (18%) in failed endovascular aortic repair, nine juxta/para-renal aneurysms (28%), six post-dissection TAAAs (18%), and 12 degenerative TAAAs (36%), respectively. The median para-visceral aortic lumen diameter was 23 mm (interquartile range [IQR], 19-27 mm), and 10 cases (30%) had APA. Of 128 TAs, 111 (87%) were cannulated/stented with distally captured aortic graft. The median time of pelvic/lower limb ischemia was 120 minutes (IQR, 90-150 minutes). TS was achieved in all patients. One patient (3%) suffered SCI, and there were no cases of stroke. An asymptomatic renal artery occlusion was detected at postoperative imaging, which was recanalized by thrombus-aspiration/relining. This was the only case of TA instability (1/128; 0.8%) and reintervention (1/33; 3%) within 30 days. Two patients (6%) died within 30 days. Median follow-up was 14 months (IQR, 6-22 months). One case (3%) of bilateral renal artery occlusion occurred at 6 months. No superior mesenteric artery or celiac trunk events occurred, with an overall TA instability rate of 2% (3/128). Eighteen patients (55%) completed the radiologic follow-up at 1 year with no new cases of TA instability. Freedom from TA instability was 91% at 1 year. T-branch by PDT seems to be safe and effective in the management of c-AAAs/TAAAs with NPA or APA. Results were satisfactory in terms of TS and mid-term TA instability, suggesting a possible enlargement of the anatomical feasibility criteria for outer branches in urgent cases."

A 67-year-old female with a history of total hip arthroplasty 10 years ago presented with acute limb ischemia after experiencing a traumatic event 72 hours prior, which had caused displacement of her hip prosthesis. Notably, she had a history of a traumatic event two years earlier for which she had been advised to undergo surgical correction, which she had refused. A multidisciplinary team assessed her preoperatively. She was diagnosed with SVS III irreversible acute limb ischemia due to compression of the external iliac artery from the prosthesis migration, prompting an emergency hip disarticulation. The patient successfully underwent hip disarticulation and mechanical thrombectomy of the external iliac artery using a Fogarty catheter. Postoperative recovery was notable, with significant pain relief, improved mental status, and restoration of the iliac pulse. Early diagnosis and management of acute arterial injury are crucial to preventing severe outcomes. This report highlights the importance of timely intervention to mitigate limb-threatening and life-threatening complications. It underscores the need for vigilant monitoring during hip replacements and the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary approach in complex cases.

It usually presents as bilateral lower limb ischemia; however, in rare cases, spinal cord infarction might coexist, mimicking cauda equina syndrome. We present a rare case of AAO by saddle embolism of a thoracic aortic mural thrombus. A 48-year-old male patient with a past medical history of ulcerative colitis and smoking was admitted with urinary and fecal incontinence, flaccid paraplegia, bilateral lower limb anesthesia, peripheral cyanosis, and pulseless lower extremities. One month earlier, he had been hospitalized due to an acute inflammatory bowel disease flare. A computed tomography (CT) angiography performed during this hospitalization revealed a pedunculated thrombus in the descending thoracic aorta, which was not present in previous imaging scans. Considering these findings, the hypothesis of acute infrarenal aortic saddle embolism of the previously identified thoracic aortic thrombus was raised and confirmed by CT angiography. Anticoagulation was immediately initiated, and the patient was submitted to emergent surgical revascularization by surgical thrombo-embolectomy with Fogarty catheters. After surgery, limb perfusion improved and the patient's neurologic deficits progressively resolved. The hypercoagulable state conferred by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was considered the underlying mechanism for arterial thromboembolism since other etiological investigations were negative. This case highlights the importance of recognizing atypical manifestations of AAO and reinforces the prognostic impact of early diagnosis and surgical referral since later intervention presents elevated mortality and morbidity risk. It also demonstrates the probable relationship between IBD and arterial thromboembolism risk, constituting a rare case of AAO associated with IBD."

We present a case where lower limb ischemia revealed this leukemia in a child. An 11-year-old with minor ankle trauma developed severe lower limb ischemia, leading to the discovery of subtotal femoral artery thrombosis. Blood tests revealed hyperleukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and anemia with 88 % blasts, confirming acute myeloid leukemia (AML-M3). Karyotyping showed a t(15;17) translocation, and the child was started on emergency chemotherapy. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), classified as AML-M3 with PML-RARA, is characterized by abnormal promyelocytes and accounts for about 10 % of acute leukemias, mostly in middle-aged adults. It has two variants: common hypergranular and rare hypogranular forms. APL can present with bone marrow failure, anemia, bleeding, and occasionally thromboembolic events, as seen in this case. The ischemia mechanism is not fully understood but may involve vessel obstruction by blasts or hypercoagulability. Diagnosis relies on clinical, morphological, phenotypic, and cytogenetic evidence, with treatment involving all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO). Hypogranular acute promyelocytic leukemia (AML3v) is a rare form and is even rarer when it is discovered following an ischaemic event, which is what makes our case so special."

Fasciotomy is the gold standard treatment for acute compartment syndrome. Some surgeons perform prophylactic fasciotomy (PF) during the same operation; however, fasciotomy may lead to wound complications and an increased length of hospital stay. This study aims to evaluate the outcomes of prophylactic fasciotomy in our hospital.MethodsThis is a retrospective observational cohort study. We reviewed the data of acute limb ischemia patients at Maharaj Nakorn Chiangmai Hospital, who were diagnosed with non-traumatic acute limb ischemia and received revascularization between January 2006 and August 2022. The primary outcomes are 30-day amputation-free survival (AFS) and overall survival (OS). Propensity score weighting with confounder adjustment was used to balance peri-operative confounders.ResultsFrom our data, there were 56 patients in the PF group and 301 in the non-prophylactic fasciotomy (NPF) group. The 30-day amputation rates were 12.5% and 10% in the PF and NPF groups, respectively (p-value 0.895). The 30-day AFS was similar between the PF and NPF groups, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32-2.45, and a p-value of 0.882. The 30-day OS in the PF group was statistically lower than that in the NPF group, HR 4.09, 95% CI 1.55-10.77, and a p-value of 0.004. The 1-year and 5-year AFS were not significantly different between the PF and NPF groups. However, the 1-year and 5-year OS were lower in the PF group compared to the NPF group, with HR 3.44, 95% CI 1.37-8.65, and a p-value of 0.009, and HR 3.04, 95% CI 1.24-7.45, and a p-value of 0.015, respectively. Fasciotomy wound infection rates were higher in the PF group compared to the NPF group, 5.5% versus 1.7%, respectively, p-value 0.017. Other clinical outcomes did not show significant statistical differences.ConclusionsProphylactic fasciotomy may not improve amputation-free survival (AFS) but increases mortality, particularly within the first 30 days, even in some high-risk patients. The use of prophylactic fasciotomy should be limited to cases where it is clearly indicated."

Multivariable analysis revealed that hypertension (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.05-0.47; P = 0.0007), presence of blood flow of both tibial arteries after EVR (aHR 0.19; 95% CI, 0.03-0.93; P = 0.04), and presence of arterial flow below the ankle after EVR (aHR 0.29; 95% CI, 0.09-0.84; P = 0.022) were independently associated with a higher AFS rate. Aortic plaque was independently associated with a lower AFS rate (aHR 3.98; 95% CI, 1.55-9.90; P = 0.048). EVR may be an acceptable treatment of ALI even in non-ambulatory patients and those with severe ALI. Achieving adequate blood flow of both tibial arteries and below the ankle by performing EVR may be important for improving patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Acute lower limb ischemia (ALI) is a vascular emergency that necessitates prompt intervention to avert irreversible damage. The relationship between ALI and paraplegia is a rare occurrence, particularly in patients with vascular risk factors such as diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN). We present the case of a 60-year-old male with a medical history of DM, HTN, and ischemic heart disease (IHD) who developed acute paraplegia 12 days after undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Initially suspected to have Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), further evaluation revealed occlusion of the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries. The patient underwent emergency bilateral fasciotomy and thrombectomy, resulting in partial recovery of lower limb function, with motor and sensory evaluations showing improvement in the right limb but limited recovery in the left. Postoperative complications included acute kidney injury, which was effectively managed. This case highlights the necessity of a broad differential diagnosis for rapidly progressing lower limb paralysis in patients with significant vascular risk factors. Timely diagnosis, prompt intervention, and careful monitoring of outcomes are essential for optimizing results in complex cases of ALI."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is a medical emergency necessitating immediate action to avert irreversible tissue harm and limb loss. Rotarex mechanical thrombectomy (RMT) has become an efficient treatment alternative for ALI. However, there is a lack of data on RMT in Taiwan. We retrospectively analyzed 61 ALI patients treated with RMT at our hospital between January 2016 and January 2022. We collected baseline characteristics, laboratory and angiographic data. We also examined the outcomes at 30 days, 6 months, and 1 year, including major amputations, minor amputations, all-cause mortality, and major adverse limb events (MALEs). Among the 61 RMT-treated patients, the average age was 70 ± 14 years. ALI affected the upper extremities in 9 cases and lower extremities in 52 cases. One-year outcomes revealed 2 major amputations (3.3%), 2 minor amputations (3.3%), 6 all-cause deaths (9.8%), and 10 MALEs (16.4%). After multiple logistic regression analysis, hemoglobin drop was significantly associated with 1-year all-cause mortality, and a history of peripheral artery disease (PAD) was significantly associated with MALEs. Our research is the first investigation into the application of RMT for ALI in Taiwan. The short- and mid-term outcomes after RMT for ALI revealed reductions in amputation, mortality, and MALE rates. In addition, a decline in hemoglobin level was a significant predictor of increased mortality, and a history of PAD was a significant predictor of increased MALEs following RMT."

    "abstract": "Phlegmasia cerulea dolens (PCD) is a rare, life- and limb-threatening condition of acute massive deep vein thrombosis (DVT) that requires emergent therapeutic intervention. While endovascular therapy is the preferred treatment approach, we describe a case where surgical embolectomy is an alternative approach in specific scenarios. In our case, we presented a patient with simultaneous PCD and acute limb ischemia (ALI). A patient presented with haematuria, abdominal pain, cyanotic changes in the limb, and sensory/motor deficits in the right lower limb. Imaging tests revealed thromboembolic occlusion of both the arterial and venous systems and a bleeding tumour in the pelvic region. Due to the rapid progression of symptoms, macroscopic haematuria with anaemia, renal failure, and the necessity for intervention in both the arterial and venous systems, we performed a successful simultaneous surgical embolectomy of the arterial and venous systems right lower limb, resulting in prompt symptom resolution. Phlegmasia cerulea dolens is a rare manifestation of massive iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis. Its pathophysiology can indirectly compromise arterial patency. Treatment options include endovascular therapy - catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT), percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (PMT) or surgical intervention. These options carry risks, including damage to the venous endothelium or periprocedural pulmonary embolism. This case report demonstrates a situation where surgical intervention was a viable option. We presented a more endothelium-sparing surgical approach using a sterile compression bandage during embolectomy. To date, there are no established guidelines from professional societies regarding the treatment of PCD. The authors emphasize the need for an individualized approach to patients with PCD. They also highlight the importance of access to comprehensive treatment, including both endovascular and surgical methods. work has been reported in line with SCARE criteria."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia is a vascular emergency associated with high rates of limb loss and mortality. As the use of endovascular techniques increases, estimation of rates and predictors of adverse outcomes remains needed. This study sought to assess contemporary outcomes and predictors of adverse events following endovascular treatment of acute limb ischemia in a nationwide, multicenter registry. Patients who had peripheral vascular intervention performed for the indication of acute limb ischemia in National Cardiovascular Data Registry Peripheral Vascular Intervention Registry between 2014 and 2020 were included. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality and major amputation during index hospitalization. Multivariable logistic regression was employed to identify predictors of the composite outcome. There were 3,541 endovascular procedures performed during the study period. Of these, 132 (3.7%) resulted in death, and 77 (2.2%) resulted in amputation during hospitalization. Thrombolysis catheters were used in 27.7% (n = 981) and thrombectomy catheters in 3.9% (n = 138). Independent predictors of death or amputation included severe lung disease (OR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.17-2.52), Rutherford Class IIb (OR: 2.44; 95% CI: 1.62-3.65), and end-stage renal disease (OR: 3.94; 95% CI: 0.73-0.85), and preprocedure hemoglobin (OR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.73- 0.85). Complications included bleeding within 72 hours of intervention (6.7%) and thrombosis (2.8%). Patients with pre-existing medical comorbidities and those with diminished limb viability were more likely to suffer adverse outcomes. Adverse event rates remain high for patients affected by acute limb ischemia despite its declining incidence."

    "abstract": "With the world population growing and aging, nonagenarians have become a distinct patient cohort with specific characteristics that render the prediction of outcomes essential. We aimed to investigate the specific characteristics of this patient's cohort in a tertiary vascular center. Retrospective analysis was conducted for all consecutive patients 90 years and above referred or treated in the Department of Vascular Surgery between January 2017 and December 2022 for vascular pathologies. The main endpoint was to analyze the type of vascular services required for nonagenarians. Additional endpoints involved evaluation of treatment outcomes during the study period based on medical records. The analysis was patient-based. A total of 148 nonagenarians were included in the study. In all, 71 (48%) of the patients underwent surgery, whereas 77 (52%) had conservative treatment. Most of the patients were referred for peripheral arterial (PAD; 56, 37.8%) and aortic-related (39, 26.4%) diseases. Other pathologies encountered involved acute limb ischemia (ALI; 25, 16.9%), carotid diseases (12, 8.1%), renal/dialysis-related consultations (8, 5.4%), and referrals from other departments (12, 5.4%). Urgent interventions were performed in 27% of the cases. Indications for surgery included PAD Rutherford Stages IV, V, and VI; symptomatic and ruptured aortic aneurysms; ALI Rutherford Stages I, IIa, and IIb; symptomatic and near total occlusion asymptomatic carotid disease; and dialysis-related procedures for patients with chronic renal failure on regular hemodialysis. Perioperative complications were experienced in 22 patients (14.9%), the 30-day reintervention rate was 7.4%, and 30-day mortality was 4.7%. The overall length of hospital stay for operated patients was a median of 8 nights. The proportion of nonagenarians in the population is growing and so is their referral to vascular surgery. Satisfactory short-term treatment outcomes can be achieved in this highly selected cohort of patients. Thirty-day mortality is higher in patients undergoing urgent procedures. Follow-up mortality was higher in the operated nonagenarians as compared with those who were treated conservatively. Careful patient selection and thorough preparation are crucial to enhance clinical outcomes. Further research on therapy outcomes of nonagenarians will enable physicians to make better evidence-based approaches to individual patients and should be encouraged. The study highlights the growing need to manage vascular diseases in nonagenarians, emphasizing that age alone should not exclude patients from surgical interventions. By demonstrating acceptable short-term outcomes with careful patient selection, this research challenges the traditional bias against operating on the elderly. Clinicians should refine risk assessment and treatment plans, particularly when balancing surgical and conservative options. Comorbidities, rather than age, are key determinants of patient suitability, encouraging more individualized, evidence-based approaches in this expanding demographic."

    "abstract": "Acute upper limb ischemia (AULI) is a medical emergency with high perioperative complication rates; however, these are poorly reported. The aim of this study is to report the complication rates following surgical revascularization in AULI. Retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing brachial embolectomy for AULI from January 2010 to October 2021 was included. Data for baseline demographic characteristics, site of arterial occlusion, cancer status, and the potential underlying etiology were included. Outcomes included technical success, early reintervention, local and systemic complications, functional limb outcome at follow-up, and amputation. 96 patients were identified. Computed tomography angiography was the first line diagnostic imaging modality, with the brachial bifurcation as the most common location for obstruction. The initial technical success rate was 76.4% (n = 73). Major adverse events occurred in 11.5% patients (n = 11); 8.3% had perioperative stroke and 7.3% resulted in in-hospital death (4.2% had both). Local complications occurred in 24%; 7.3% had site hematoma, 11.5% had early thrombosis, and 4.2% had 30-day thrombosis. 2.1% resulted in amputation. No variables were identified as having significant association with local surgical complications. AULI is often associated with underlying systemic and cardiac disorders. An evidence based approach to guide the nonoperative management of AULI is lacking. In appropriately selected patients, Fogarty thrombectomy has a reasonable technical success rate; however, the associated perioperative complication rate is high, both locally and systemically. Further studies of larger sample size are needed to identify negative predictors and reduce perioperative complications in this challenging cohort."

    "abstract": "The number of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) has been progressively increasing worldwide over the past decades, and many international organizations consider DM as a public health emergency of the 21st century.Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is the most severe stage of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in DM and is characterized by a high risk of limb loss without revascularization. Traditional treatment tactics include open and endovascular revascularization surgical techniques. However, in patients not eligible for revascularization and in cases where performed surgical treatment performed has been ineffective, there are almost no therapeutic alternatives, often leading to amputations and death. As of today, one of the newest non-surgical treatment options is cell therapy. Among different cells, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are potentially one of the most prospective for use in this patient population.This article provides an overview of clinical trials using cell therapy in patients with CLI.To analyze publications, electronic databases PubMed, SCOPUS, ClinicalTrials, and ScienceDirect were searched to identify published data from clinical trials, research studies, and review articles on cell therapy for critical lower extremity ischemia. After the search, 489 results were received.As a result of systematic selection, 22 clinical trials were analyzed.According to the analyzed literature data, the use of cell products in this category of patients is effective and safe. Cell therapy can stimulate the formation of new vessels and enhances collateral circulation; it is also reported improved distal perfusion, increased pain-free walking distance, decreased amputation rates, and increased survival rates.Nevertheless, further study of the potential use of this category of drugs is needed. За последние десятилетия количество больных сахарным диабетом (СД) во всем мире прогрессивно увеличивается, и многие международные организации рассматривают СД как чрезвычайную ситуацию в здравоохранении XXI века. Критическая ишемия нижних конечностей (КИНК) является наиболее тяжелой стадией заболеваний артерий нижних конечностей (ЗАНК) при СД и характеризуется высоким риском потери конечности без восстановления кровотока. Традиционные тактики лечения включают открытые и эндоваскулярные методы реваскуляризации. Однако у пациентов, не подлежащих реваскуляризации, и в случаях, когда проведенное хирургическое лечение оказалось недостаточно эффективно, существует мало терапевтических альтернатив, что часто приводит к ампутациям и смерти. На сегодняшний день одним из новейших нехирургических методов лечения является клеточная терапия. В свою очередь мезенхимальные стромальные клетки (МСК) потенциально являются одними из наиболее перспективных для применения у данной категории пациентов. В представленной статье приведен обзор клинических исследований с использованием клеточной терапии у пациентов с КИНК. Для анализа публикаций был проведен поиск в электронных базах данных PubMed, SCOPUS, ClinicalTrials и ScienceDirect с целью выявления опубликованных данных клинических испытаний, научных исследований и обзорных статей, посвященных клеточной терапии при критической ишемии нижних конечностей. В результате поиска было получено 489 результатов. По итогу систематического отбора проведен анализ 22 клинических исследований. Согласно проанализированным литературным данным, применение клеточных продуктов у данной категории пациентов эффективно и безопасно. Клеточная терапия способствует формированию новых сосудов и усилению коллатерального кровообращения; также отмечается улучшение дистальной перфузии, увеличение дистанции безболевой ходьбы, снижение частоты ампутаций и увеличение коэффициента выживаемости. Тем не менее необходимо дальнейшее изучение возможностей применения этой категории препаратов."

    "abstract": "Tongue necrosis is a rare and relatively uncommon condition, usually caused by vasculitis, thrombosis, severe hypotension due to septic or cardiogenic shock, vasopressor use, or intubation. Following damage such as necrosis, dystrophic calcification, a type of soft tissue calcification, can occur. Herein, we present a unique case of bilateral tongue necrosis in a patient with nonintubated septic shock. A 70-year-old East Asian man with no significant medical history presented to the emergency department with postprandial epigastric pain. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit with hypotension due to septic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation. After a short course of vasopressors, the patient developed tongue discoloration and swelling without limb ischemia. Computed tomography was performed to observe the tongue necrosis, and calcification of the tongue was found. The patient was successfully treated by wiping the area with a hexamidine-soaked gauze. Tongue necrosis remains a rare finding, and its occurrence as a complication of vasopressor use is even rarer. Therefore, even with relatively short courses of vasopressors in the intensive care unit, daily visualization of the tongue to check for discoloration, along with daily inspection and pulse checks of the limbs, can help identify vasospasms. These measures allow for prompt intervention, minimizing permanent damage and shortening the recovery time."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia (ALI) due to arterial thromboembolic occlusion is a critical emergency in vascular medicine, requiring attention for rapid diagnosis and intervention, to prevent limb loss and major amputation, which is associated with patient disability in the long term. Traditionally, surgical embolectomy has been used for the treatment of ALI. Endovascular treatment of ALI traditionally involved catheter-directed thrombolysis. This option, however, poses some limitations, including an increased risk for access site and systemic bleeding complications, especially in patients with high bleeding risk. Therefore, in the last decades, several devices have been developed and tested for the mechanical endovascular treatment of ALI. Such devices involve either rotational thrombectomy or continuous thrombus aspiration. While rotational thrombectomy is limited in rather large arteries due to the risk of dissection and perforation in arteries <3 mm, continuous thrombus aspiration can be applied in smaller vessels and tortuous anatomies. In our case series we present a minimal-invasive endovascular approach for the treatment of two patients with ALI due to thrombotic occlusion of tortious and small diameter arteries. Minimal-invasive mechanical thrombectomy using the Penumbra Aspiration System emerged as a successful alternative to surgical embolectomy, enabling prompt treatment and with a short hospital stay for both patients. Our article therefore highlights the use of continuous thrombus aspiration in small diameter vessels and tortuous anatomies, which may represent a contraindication for the use of rotational thrombectomy. In addition, this technique may be applied even in patients with higher bleeding risk since additional lysis is not necessary in patients, where complete thrombus removal can be achieved by this device."

    "abstract": "Ischemia/reperfusion injury is one of the most challenging postoperative situations in vascular surgery, both in elective procedures with prolonged clamping time and in delayed emergency cases with vascular occlusion. The inflammatory response that develops during ischemia and the oxygen-free radicals that proliferate during reperfusion have detrimental effects on the brain, heart, and kidneys. In this study, we aimed to compare the effects of vanillic and rosmarinic acid in preventing ischemia/reperfusion injury in a lower limb ischemia-reperfusion model in rats. Thirty-two female Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 185-240 g were randomly divided into four groups of eight animals each. Group 1 was designated as the control, Group 2 as ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), Group 3 as ischemia/reperfusion + vanillic acid (I/R + VA), and Group 4 as ischemia/reperfusion + rosmarinic acid (I/R + RA). In all groups except the control, the infrarenal abdominal aorta was clamped, and 60 minutes of ischemia followed by 120 minutes of reperfusion was performed. Vanillic acid was administered intra-abdominally 15 minutes before the start of reperfusion in Group 3, and rosmarinic acid in Group 4. At the end of the reperfusion phase, blood samples and hearts were collected, and the rats were euthanized. Histopathologically, myofibrillar edema, myocytolysis, focal hemorrhages, and infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) in cardiac tissue were examined. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidative status (TOS), oxidative stress index (OSI), 8-OH-deoxyguanosine, lactonase, and arylesterase activity were measured in blood samples. Myofibrillar edema was most pronounced in the I/R group and less pronounced in the I/R + VA and I/R + RA groups (p=0.005 and p=0.066, respectively). There was no difference between the ischemia/reperfusion groups regarding myocytolysis, focal hemorrhage, and PMNL infiltration (p>0.99). Among all groups, TOS and OSI were lowest in the control group, while TAC was highest. TAC was similar in the I/R + VA and I/R + RA groups but was significantly higher in these two groups than in the I/R group. The lactonase activity in the I/R + VA group was similar to that in the control group but was significantly higher compared to the I/R and I/R + RA groups. Our study shows that vanillic and rosmarinic acids reduce myofibrillar edema in the heart after lower limb ischemia and increase TAC. However, vanillic acid increases the activity of lactonase, an enzyme known for its antioxidant effect, more than rosmarinic acid."

    "abstract": "Endovascular treatment of popliteal aneurysms (PA) has increased in the last few years, quickly becoming the main treatment performed in many vascular centers, based on the acceptable and promising outcomes reported in the literature. However, endograft infections after endovascular popliteal aneurysm repair (EPAR) are the most dangerous complications to occur as they involve serious local compromise and usually require open surgical conversion and device explantation to preserve the affected extremity. We report two patients who were admitted to the emergency room of our hospital for pain and edema in the lower leg. Both patients had undergone exclusion of a ruptured PA a few years before by endovascular graft. CTA testing showed a significant volume of fluid-corpuscular collection related to perianeurysmal abscess collection in both cases. Blood cultures and drained material cultures were positive for Staphylococcus capitis in the first case and S. aureus in the second. Prophylactic antibiotics were administered for 10 days, then patients underwent an open surgical conversion with the complete explantation of endovascular material and a femoro-popliteal bypass using an autologous vein in the first case and a biological bovine pericardium prosthesis in the second case. The infective department of our hospital had defined a discharged specific antibiotic therapy for each patient, based on intraoperative microbiological samples. Furthermore, we have examined the literature and found six more cases described in case report articles that refer to popliteal graft infections by different microorganisms, mostly presenting acute limb ischemia as the first symptom and suggesting endograft explantation with open conversion and autologous vein bypass as the commonest therapeutic choice. The open surgical conversion of popliteal endograft infection is the best strategy to manage peripheral infection after an endovascular popliteal aneurysm repair procedure."

    "abstract": "Vascular injuries are serious complications of multiligament knee injuries and can result in catastrophic outcomes. These injuries can range from intimal flaps with no compromise of the distal perfusion to a complete occlusion or transection requiring emergent vascular intervention. Several diagnostic tests, including the measurement of the ankle-brachial index (ABI), conventional angiography, and computed tomography angiography (CTA), are commonly used as diagnostic tools to identify vascular injuries in the context of a multiligament knee injury. In this report, the authors discuss the case of a patient with a normal ABI and palpable distal pulses on physical examination who developed limb ischemia after a multiligament knee reconstruction under tourniquet. The patient underwent emergent embolectomy and had a favorable postoperative outcome. During vascular exploration, there was no evidence of injury to the popliteal artery. The two working diagnoses were that either the patient had an intimal flap complicated by the development of a thrombus during surgery or that the initial vascular injury was not detected by ABI and clinical examination. Therefore, intimal flaps in multiligament knee injuries can lead to limb threatening ischemia in the context of reconstructive knee surgery and are likely underdiagnosed with ABI assessment. The utilization of preoperative CTA may help identify these injuries in patients indicated for reconstructive surgeries."

In adults, it is nearly always secondary to pathological changes in the knee joint that cause an effusion. Baker cysts are mostly asymptomatic, but they may have presentations ranging from mild swelling, a picture similar to infective arthritis, to massive swelling leading to rupture and causing lower limb ischemia. We have presented these cases of post-tubercular baker cysts and evaluated their post-treatment outcomes. Between September 2018 and September 2021, 12 patients with post-tuberculous baker cysts who presented to the outpatient department or emergency department of our institute were treated with conservative or open excision and followed up for 12 months at regular intervals. The functional assessment was done by VAS pain scoring and Lysholm knee scoring at the start of treatment, 1, 6 and 12 months after the surgery or conservative treatment. 8 patients with post-tubercular Baker cysts were managed conservatively with aspirations and medications. Four patients with large multiloculated post-tubercular baker cysts were managed operatively. The mean age of patients with complicated post-tuberculosis Baker cyst was 44.92 ± 5.07 years. VAS The scoring of all the patients improved with each visit and 1-year follow-up. The Lysholm Knee score of patients also improved with each visit. All patients had excellent scores, with 3 patients having a score of 100 at 1-year follow-up. Complicated Baker's cysts with multiloculated post-tubercular cysts need surgical management in most cases. Excellent to good functional outcomes can be achieved in these unusual cases with prompt intervention, detailed work-up, and medications."

Catheter-directed thrombolysis is a possible treatment option for mild to moderate ALI, with improved results from endovascular procedures and thrombolytic drugs. However, patients receiving thrombolysis may experience higher rates of distal embolization, serious bleeding events, and stroke than those undergoing surgery. The review article emphasizes the need for postoperative and extended management of ALI patients, including monitoring for compartment syndrome, managing reperfusion damage, and reducing changeable cardiovascular risk factors such as lipid-lowering therapy, diabetes management, and smoking cessation. Complications that can arise from thrombolytic therapy are also discussed, including hemorrhagic complications, minor bleeding, and reperfusion damage, with recommendations to monitor patients closely during treatment and discontinue therapy immediately if any abnormalities are detected. Follow-up evaluations for patients, including Doppler ultrasound, ankle brachial index, pulse volume recordings, and laboratory tests, are recommended to ensure the best possible outcome for patients with ALI."

The aim of the study was to determine characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 who presented with aortic thrombus. We retrospectively conducted a single-center, descriptive study over a period of 1 year and 7 months, between June 2021 and December 2022, involving eight patients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with aortic thrombus revealed by acute limb ischemia. The mean age of patients was 67 years with a median of 64, 5 ± 14. Of the eight included patients, six were men and two were women. Aortic thrombus was diagnosed in all cases. Six patients developed one episode of acute limb ischemia and one patient had recurrent upper and lower ischemia despite full anticoagulation whereas one patient had distal embolization with palpable pulses. In six patients, the thrombi were located in descending and abdominal aorta, while two patients presented with ascending aorta floating thrombus. Seven patients required urgent revascularization whereas medical treatment was recommended for one patient. The primary outcomes were successful in five cases, one patient had to be amputated above elbow, whereas two patients died due to a rapid deterioration of respiratory condition. Aortic thrombosis is a rare clinical presentation in SARS-CoV-2 infection but with potentially fatal embolic complication. Physicians should maintain a high degree of clinical suspicion to diagnose thromboembolic consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection for timely management and avoiding morbidities like ischemic stroke and major amputations."

    "title": "A Five-Year Retrospective Study from a Single Center on the Location, Presentation, Diagnosis, and Management of 110 Patients with Aneurysms of the Femoral and Popliteal Arteries of the Lower Limb.",
    "abstract": "Background: Peripheral aneurysms, although known about for centuries, are challenging to monitor due to their asymptomatic nature. Advanced imaging has improved detection, which is crucial for preventing emergent complications. This five-year retrospective study from a single center aimed to evaluate the location, presentation, diagnosis, and management of 110 patients with aneurysms of the femoral and popliteal arteries of the lower limb. Materials and methods: The study included 71 true aneurysms and 39 pseudoaneurysms patients treated between 2018-2023. Treatment methods were based on aneurysm size, atherosclerosis severity, and operation risk. The study assessed patient demographics, surgical details, postoperative complications, and aneurysm characteristics. Results: Acute limb ischemia was more prevalent in true aneurysms (25.4% vs. 7.7%; p = 0.02). Aneurysmectomy was performed more frequently in pseudoaneurysms (87.2% vs. 54.9%; p < 0.001), while endovascular treatment and surgical bypass were more common in true aneurysms (Endovascular: 22.5% vs. 2.6%; p = 0.01; bypass: 21.1% vs. 0%; p < 0.001). Early postoperative complications occurred in 22.7% of patients. The 12-month freedom from reoperations (73.7% vs. 87%; p = 0.07), amputations (97.7% vs. 93.8%; p = 0.2), and graft stenosis (78.7% vs. 86.87%; p = 0.06) showed no significant differences between groups. Conclusions: Lower limb aneurysms often present with non-specific symptoms, leading to late diagnosis and life-threatening complications. Both open and endovascular treatments are feasible, though more research is needed for pseudoaneurysms. Vigilant follow-up is crucial due to potential adverse events, though overall mortality and morbidity remain low."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is a morbid and deadly diagnosis. However, existing epidemiologic studies describing ALI predate the introduction of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 and direct oral anticoagulants in 2011. Thus, we synergized the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) and United States Census to define contemporary trends in the incidence, treatment, and outcomes of ALI in the US. We included emergent admissions of adults with primary diagnosis of lower extremity ALI in survey-weighted NIS data (2005-2020). Mann-Kendal trend test evaluated ALI incidence (primary outcome), anticoagulation usage, insurance coverage, revascularization type, and in-hospital amputation/death. Multivariable logistic regression quantified covariate associations with in-hospital amputation/death. Of the 582,322,862 estimated hospitalizations in the NIS, 227,440 met the inclusion criteria (mean age 68.80 years, 49.94% women, 76.66% White). ALI incidence peaked in 2006 (7.16/100,000 person-years) but has declined since 2015 to 4.16/100,000 person-years in 2020 (ptrend = 0.008). Endovascular revascularization, anticoagulation, and Medicaid coverage increased, while self-pay insurance decreased (ptrend < 0.05). Amputation rates significantly decreased from 8.04 to 6.54% (ptrend = 0.01) while death rate remained at 5.59% (ptrend = 0.16) over the study period. Prehospitalization anticoagulation was associated with decreased amputation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65-0.84)) and death (aOR = 0.50 (95% CI 0.43-0.57)). When controlling for covariates, women had a higher risk of death (aOR = 1.17 (95% CI 1.07-1.27), P < 0.0001), while Black patients had a higher risk of amputation (aOR = 1.24 (95% CI 1.10-1.41), P < 0.0001). Our US population based epidemiological study demonstrates that ALI incidence and in-hospital amputation rates are decreasing, while mortality remains unchanged. We further highlight the ongoing need for ALI investigation specifically as it relates to access to care, antithrombotic therapy use, treatment strategy, and strategies to combat gender and racial disparities."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischaemia (ALI) is an emergent clinical condition that strains pre-hospital resources and impacts healthcare costs and patient quality of life. Hypothermia has long been used in clinical and research settings to mitigate ischaemic damage in tissues, but prompt reperfusion is needed to prevent loss of limb or function from ALI. To address the unmet need for pre-hospital intervention of threatened limbs awaiting definitive specialty care, we have focused on controlled application of hypothermia. Over years of animal experiments, phantom limb creation, and materials selection, we conceptualised and created a portable limb-cooling device that can be used alone or combined with a traditional tourniquet or resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta. Here, we describe our process of building and testing the device, from computer simulation through animal-limb metabolic studies, to prototype testing."

    "abstract": "Approximately 4 million people with peripheral artery disease (PAD) present with critical limb ischemia each year, requiring urgent revascularization to avoid loss of limb. Minimally-invasive (i.e. endovascular) revascularization is preferable due to increased recovery time and increased risk of complications associated with open surgery. However, 40% of people with PAD also have chronic total occlusions (CTOs), resulting in > 20% of revascularization procedures failing when CTOs are present. A steerable robotic guidewire with integrated forward-viewing imaging capabilities would allow the guidewire to navigate through tortuous vasculature and facilitate crossing CTOs in revascularization procedures that currently fail due to inability to route the guidewire. The robotic steering capabilities of the guidewire can be leveraged for 3D synthetic aperture imaging with a simplified, low element count, forward-viewing 2D array on the tip of the mechanically-steered guidewire. Images can then be formed using a hybrid beamforming approach, with focal delays calculated for each element on the tip of the guidewire and for each physical location to which the robotically-steered guidewire is steered. Unlike synthetic aperture imaging with a steerable guidewire having only a single element transducer, an array with even a small number of elements can allow estimation of blood flow and physiological motion in vivo. A miniature, low element count 2D array transducer with 9 total elements (3 × 3) having total dimensions of 1.5 mm × 1.5 mm was designed to operate at 17 MHz. A proof-of-concept 2D array transducer was fabricated and characterized acoustically. The developed array was then used to image a wire target, a peripheral stent, and an ex vivo porcine iliac artery. Images were formed using the described synthetic aperture beamforming strategy. Acoustic characterization showed a mean resonance frequency of 17.6 MHz and a -6 dB bandwidth of 35%. Lateral and axial resolution were 0.271 mm and 0.122 mm, respectively, and an increase in SNR of 4.8 dB was observed for the 2D array relative to the single element case. The first 2D array imaging system utilizing both mechanical and electronic steering for guidewire-based imaging was developed and demonstrated. A 2D array imaging system operating on the tip of the mechanically-steered guidewire provides improved frame rate and increases field of view relative to a single element transducer. Finally, 2D array and single element imaging were compared for introduced motion errors, with the 2D array providing a 46.1% increase in SNR, and 58.5% and 17.3% improvement in lateral and axial resolution, respectively, relative to single element guidewire imaging."

    "abstract": "Subclavian arterial injury due to blunt trauma is rare but can have devastating outcomes. Massive hemorrhage or limb ischemia might develop depending on the extent of damage, and open repair might be necessary to salvage the limb. However, life-saving treatments should be prioritized in critically unstable patients. A 21-year-old male patient who was transferred to our trauma center following a motorcycle accident. Abdominal and chest computed tomography (CT) revealed right renal injury and massive hemothorax with several rib fractures in the right chest. Right renal injury with multiple extravasations and right 8th intercostal arterial injury were detected during angiography. Emergent exploration with lateral thoracotomy was performed to manage right hemothorax. Pulsating bleeding from the thoracic roof observed in the operative field suggested a subclavian arterial injury. The unstable vital signs did not recover despite massive transfusion, and his right arm had already stiffened. Therefore, endovascular approach was adopted and the second portion of the right subclavian artery was embolized using microcoils and thrombin. Postoperative intensive care unit management performed to resuscitate patient from multiorgan failure included continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). After confirming the demarcation lines, transhumeral amputation of the right arm was performed on admission day 12. The patient recovered from multiorgan failure for more than 3 weeks after the accident; however, the patient survived. Limb salvage, albeit critical for quality of life, is not possible in some cases where life-saving measures require its sacrifice. In these cases, quick decision-making by the surgeon is paramount for patient survival. As illustrated in this case, endovascular approaches should be considered less invasive measures to save the patient's life."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia (ALI) remains a vascular emergency with high morbidity and mortality. While the JETi Hydrodynamic Thrombectomy System (Abbott) offers a percutaneous approach to fragment and aspirate the thrombus in patients with arterial occlusions, data on its efficacy and safety are limited. This study reports our early experience using the JETi device to treat ALI at our institution. This is a single-center, retrospective review of patients with ALI treated with the JETi device between September 2020 and December 2022. Patients were included if the JETi device was used either as a primary intervention or as an adjunct procedure. The primary endpoint was technical success defined as <50% residual thrombus after intervention. Secondary endpoints included achieving complete resolution of the thrombus on angiogram, acute kidney injury (AKI), major bleeding, 30-day major amputation, and 30-day mortality. A total of 59 JETi procedures for ALI (median age 62 years [interquartile range: 56-71 years]) were performed on 39 male and 20 female patients. The median time from onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 24 hours (interquartile range: 4-168 hours). Rutherford classifications were I (10), IIa (27), IIb (14), and undocumented (8). Etiology of ALI was native vessel thrombosis (27), embolism (16), graft/stent thrombosis (14), and iatrogenic (2). A total of 124 vessels were treated, with an average of 2.1 vessels per procedure. The primary outcome was achieved in 86% (107/124) of the arteries, with 82% (102/124) successfully opened using the JETi device alone without the need for any adjunctive therapy. Complete resolution of the thrombus using JETi was achieved in 81% (101/124) arteries, with or without the use of adjunctive therapy. A total of 6.7% (4/59) patients required a major limb amputation within 30 days despite successful recanalization, and one 30-day mortality was recorded. Complications included distal embolization (5), access site hematoma (2), and AKI (4). No major bleeding, hemolysis-induced AKI, or vessel dissection or perforation was observed. The JETi device appears to be a safe and effective percutaneous treatment option in the management of ALI. It provides definitive treatment with a high technical success rate of 86% and a good safety profile."

    "abstract": "Popliteal artery aneurysms (PAAs) are the most common peripheral aneurysm. However, due to its rarity, the cumulative body of evidence regarding patient patterns, treatment strategies, and perioperative outcomes is limited. This analysis aims to investigate distinct phenotypical patient profiles and associated treatment and outcomes in patients with a PAA by performing an unsupervised clustering analysis of the POPART (Practice of Popliteal Artery Aneurysm Repair and Therapy) registry. A cluster analysis (using k-means clustering) was performed on data obtained from the multicenter POPART registry (42 centers from Germany and Luxembourg). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore validity and stability. Using 2 clusters, patients were primarily separated by the absence or presence of clinical symptoms. Within the cluster of symptomatic patients, the main difference between patients with acute limb ischemia presentation and nonemergency symptomatic patients was PAA diameter. When using 6 clusters, patients were primarily grouped by comorbidities, with patients with acute limb ischemia forming a separate cluster. Despite markedly different risk profiles, perioperative complication rates appeared to be positively associated with the proportion of emergency patients. However, clusters with a higher proportion of patients having any symptoms before treatment experienced a lower rate of perioperative complications. The conducted analyses revealed both an insight to the public health reality of PAA care as well as patients with PAA at elevated risk for adverse outcomes. This analysis suggests that the preoperative clinic is a far more crucial adjunct to the patient's preoperative risk assessment than the patient's epidemiological profile by itself."

There is limited literature on malperfusion syndrome after BTAI, and the timing of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in patients with this condition has not been defined. A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of patients with BTAI treated between January 2021 and October 2023. Clinical and thoracic aortic (TA) imaging data, time to TEVAR, in-hospital death, and malperfusion/reperfusion sequelae (paraplegia, renal/visceral/limb ischemia, and compartment syndromes) were assessed. Correlations between clinical and imaging findings, time to TEVAR, and outcomes were evaluated. Of the 19,203 trauma patients evaluated, 13,717 (71%) had blunt injuries and 77 (0.6%) had BTAI. The majority (67.5%) were male, with a median age of 40 years (IQR: 33-55). TEVAR was performed in 42 (54.5%) patients. Seven (9.1%) patients presented with clinical and TA imaging criteria for traumatic thoracic aortic coarctation (TTAC), including diminished/absent femoral pulses and TA luminal narrowing of 50% to 99%. The median time to TEVAR was 9 (IQR: 5-32), 11, and 4 hours for all non-TTAC and TTAC BTAI patients, respectively ( P =0.037). Only TTAC patients presented/developed malperfusion/reperfusion sequelae. In-hospital mortality rates were 7.8%, 5.8%, and 29% for all non-TTAC and TTAC BTAI patients, respectively ( P =0.09). Aortic-related mortality occurred in only 2 (2.6%) TTAC patients. Patients with clinical and TA imaging manifestations of TTAC are predisposed to malperfusion/reperfusion sequelae if TEVAR is delayed. We recommend the emergent repair of all BTAIs with TTAC."

The primary outcome was the incidence of limb ischemia and major bleeding before and after the protocol initiation. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital and 30-day MACCE rate (death, myocardial infarction, stroke, emergent CABG), and how often the operators followed the protocol. A total of 89 patients had pVAD left in place (29 pre-protocol initiation and 60 post-protocol initiation). There was a significant decrease in incidence of limb ischemia post-protocol initiation compared to pre (17.2 % vs 1.7 %, p = 0.01) but no difference in bleeding incidence (13.8 % vs 20.0 %, p = 0.47).

He was tachycardic with a leucocytosis, an unremarkable abdominal exam and a pulseless, insensate and paralysed left lower extremity. Imaging revealed sigmoid thickening, an abscess adjacent to iliac vasculature and occlusion of the left popliteal artery. The abscess came in contact with prior spine anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) hardware at L5-S1 vertebrae. The patient was taken urgently to the operating room for embolectomy, thrombectomy and fasciotomy. He was started on antibiotics and later underwent operative drainage with debridement for osteomyelitis. Non-operative management of the complicated diverticulitis failed, necessitating open sigmoidectomy with colostomy. 1 year later, he was symptom-free and the colostomy was reversed."

    "title": "Bypass Patency and Amputation-Free Survival after Popliteal Aneurysm Exclusion Significantly Depends on Patient Age and Medical Complications: A Detailed Dual-Center Analysis of 395 Consecutive Elective and Emergency Procedures.",
    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: A popliteal artery aneurysm (PAA) is traditionally treated by an open PAA repair (OPAR) with a popliteo-popliteal venous graft interposition. Although excellent outcomes have been reported in elective cases, the results are much worse in cases of emergency presentation or with the necessity of adjunct procedures. This study aimed to identify the risk factors that might decrease amputation-free survival (efficacy endpoint) and lower graft patency (technical endpoint). Patients and Methods: A dual-center retrospective analysis was performed from 2000 to 2021 covering all consecutive PAA repairs stratified for elective vs. emergency repair, considering the patient (i.e., age and comorbidities), PAA (i.e., diameter and tibial runoff vessels), and procedural characteristics (i.e., procedure time, material, and bypass configuration). Descriptive, univariate, and multivariate statistics were used. Results: In 316 patients (69.8 ± 10.5 years), 395 PAAs (mean diameter 31.9 ± 12.9 mm) were operated, 67 as an emergency procedure (6× rupture; 93.8% severe acute limb ischemia). The majority had OPAR (366 procedures). Emergency patients had worse pre- and postoperative tibial runoff, longer procedure times, and more complex reconstructions harboring a variety of adjunct procedures as well as more medical and surgical complications (all p < 0.001). Overall, the in-hospital major amputation rate and mortality rate were 3.6% and 0.8%, respectively. The median follow-up was 49 months. Five-year primary and secondary patency rates were 80% and 94.7%. Patency for venous grafts outperformed alloplastic and composite reconstructions (p < 0.001), but prolonged the average procedure time by 51.4 (24.3-78.6) min (p < 0.001). Amputation-free survival was significantly better after elective procedures (p < 0.001), but only during the early (in-hospital) phase. An increase in patient age and any medical complications were significant negative predictors, regardless of the aneurysm size. Conclusions: A popliteo-popliteal vein interposition remains the gold standard for treatment despite a probably longer procedure time for both elective and emergency PAA repairs. To determine the most effective treatment strategies for older and probably frailer patients, factors such as the aneurysm size and the patient's overall condition should be considered."

    "abstract": "Knee malalignment can increase the risk of osteoarthritis. Osteotomies can correct limb deformities, but they come with the risk of complications such as cortical hinge fracture, hardware failure, pain syndrome, and infection. Vascular injury is rare, but it can lead to bleeding, limb ischemia, and swelling. If revascularization is delayed for over 12 h, it can result in poor outcomes. The work has been reported in line with the SCARE criteria. A 41-year-old female underwent a lateral close-wedge distal femoral osteotomy. Postoperatively, no distal pulse was detected. An emergency vascular surgery consultation revealed popliteal vein penetration and popliteal artery thrombosis, probably during pin penetration. Revascularization was performed, and the patient was discharged without complications. At the three-year follow-up, the patient was in good health and without complications. Knowledge of the femoral artery and vein's proximity to the apex of the wedge is crucial in lateral close wedge distal femoral osteotomy. Despite vascular injury with an oscillating saw, it can happen during guide pin insertion. Although Intraoperative massive bleeding can show vascular injury, lack of it was not a protective factor. During the process of pin insertion, it is important to ensure that the pin's orientation is directly lateral to the medial. This should be checked using the C-Arm by obtaining AP, Lat, and Oblique views. To check for intraoperative bleeding, the tourniquet should be deflated. Once the procedure is complete, it is important to check for any vascular injury by examining distal pulses and limb perfusion carefully, particularly in the recovery room."

A rare but fatal cause of ACS is bulimia nervosa (BN), which is an eating disorder characterized by bingeing, followed by methods to avoid weight gain, including purging. We present a case of a 20-year-old woman who presented with abdominal pain and distension after consuming a large quantity of food the previous night and was unable to purge. She was initially managed conservatively and discharged home, but returned subsequently on the same day with clinical features of ACS secondary to acute gastric distension. Decompression resulted in life-threatening reperfusion injury with critical electrolyte abnormalities and fatal cardiac arrest in the operating theatre. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: A systematic review of the literature found only 11 case reports of ACS secondary to BN, of which only 6 patients survived due to early diagnosis and decompression. Inability to purge and lower limb ischemia appeared to be associated with increased mortality. As BN is a common emergency presentation, the case and systematic review highlights the need to consider ACS as a potentially life-threatening complication of binge eating, particularly when there is unsuccessful purging."

Therefore, we tend to rely on studies investigating acute ischemic stroke in atrial fibrillation for anticoagulation recommendations. We retrospectively reviewed data for patients with acute ischemic stroke who had a non-atrial fibrillation emergent indication for anticoagulation (e.g., intra-arterial thrombus, intracardiac thrombus, acute coronary syndrome, acute limb ischemia, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) diagnosed within 3 days of acute ischemic stroke. Patients who received anticoagulation ≤ 3 days of stroke onset (Group A) were compared to those who either received it afterwards or did not receive it at all (Group B). Out of the 558 patients, only 88 patients met our inclusion criteria. Of the total cohort, 55.7 % patients were males, and basic demographics were similar in both groups except for milder strokes in Group A (national institute of health stroke scale 6 vs. 12.5, p = 0.03). Only 2 patients in Group A and 1 patient in Group B developed intracranial hemorrhage, which was not statistically significant. Group A patients had a lower incidence of both new diagnosis (2 % vs. 34.2 % %, p < 0.001) and propagation of an established venous thromboembolism. They also had a lower rate of any thromboembolic complication (2 % vs. 42 %, p < 0.001). Early anticoagulation (i.e., ≤ 3 days) in non-atrial fibrillation ischemic stroke patients with an emergent indication may be safe and carry a lower risk of thromboembolic complications than later anticoagulation."

    "abstract": "Amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction (AIT) is a side-effect associated with the use of Amiodarone for the treatment of refractory arrythmias. Resulting hyperthyroidism can precipitate cardiac complications, including cardiac ischemia and myocardial infarction, although this has only been described in a few case reports. We present here a clinical scenario involving a 66-year-old male Caucasian patient under Amiodarone for atrial fibrillation, who developed AIT. In the presence of dyspnea, multiple cardiovascular risk factors and ECG abnormalities, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, showing inferobasal hypokinesia. This led to further investigations through a cardiac PET-CT, where cardiac ischemia was suspected. Ultimately, the coronary angiography revealed no abnormalities. Nonetheless, these extensive cardiologic investigations led to a delay in initiating an emergency endovascular revascularization for acute-on-chronic left limb ischemia. Although initial treatment using Carbimazole was not successful after three weeks, the patient reached euthyroidism after completion of the treatment with Prednisone so that eventually thyroidectomy was not performed. Endovascular revascularization was finally performed after more than one month. We discuss here cardiac abnormalities in patients with AIT, which may be due to relative ischemia secondary to increased metabolic demand during hyperthyroidism. Improvement of cardiac complications is expected through an optimal AIT therapy including medical therapy as the primary approach and, when necessary, thyroidectomy. Cardiac investigations in the context of AIT should be carefully considered and may not justify delaying other crucial interventions. If considered mandatory, diagnostic procedures such as coronary angiography should be preferred to functional testing."

    "abstract": "The presence of a primary cardiac tumor in a pediatric patient is a rare echocardiographic finding. We report the case of an 11-year-old female patient with multiple peripheral embolisms, due to a gigantic left ventricular tumor, with a unique echocardiographic appearance. The patient was referred to the emergency department due to acute pain and loss of sensitivity in both of her legs. Past medical history was significant for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Upon physical examination, suspicion of bilateral lower leg ischemia was raised. Doppler arterial ultrasound of both legs confirmed the suspicion mentioned above, as the right lower extremity suffered from partial arterial occlusion of the external iliac artery and total occlusion of the femoral arteries. Meanwhile, in the left lower extremity, the occlusion was localized in the proximal tibio-peroneal artery. Cardiac sonography revealed a massive, mobile, left ventricular intracavitary mass. Aside from its large dimensions (6.3 cm by 3 cm), its aspect was striking as well as it had very mobile and friable edges. Emergency bilateral endarterectomy and excision of the left ventricular tumor were performed alongside systemic anticoagulant therapy, with excellent results, as no tumoral residual masses could be seen in the left ventricle, and the arterial blood flow was restored completely in both lower extremities. The histopathological aspect of the excised masses was that of a myxoma. The patient recovered well after surgery and was discharged on postoperative day 14. Despite only a handful of cases of cardiac myxomas being reported due to their rarity in the pediatric population, clinical presentation with peripheric embolism triggered a high index of suspicion of embolic mechanism in our patient and prompted a rapid assessment and successful management."

Few studies have evaluated late VCs following ECMO; this study aims to assess occurrence and management practices of late VCs following discharge. A retrospective single-institution review was performed of all patients surviving initial hospitalization after being cannulated for central or peripheral veno-venous (VV) or veno-arterial (VA) ECMO between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020. Primary outcomes were to categorize and determine the rate of late VCs. Late VCs were defined as any cannulated vessel injury resulting from ECMO cannulation presenting after discharge from index hospitalization. Analysis was conducted by cannulated vessel and stratified by VV or VA ECMO configurations. A total of 229 patients were identified, of which 50.6% (n = 116) survived until discharge. Late VCs occurred in 7.8% of the surviving cohort (n = 9/116); with a median time until presentation of 150 days (interquartile range, 83-251 days). The most common late VC was infection (n = 5; 55.6%) followed by progression to limb-threatening ischemia (n = 4; 44.4%).

The majority of patients presenting with late VCs had initially been cannulated for peripheral VA ECMO (n = 8; 88.9%), and one patient (11.1%) was cannulated for peripheral VV ECMO. VCs during index hospitalization were seen in 77.8% of patients (n = 7) returning with late VCs. Odds for late VCs were significantly increased in patients that had been cannulated for ECMO as part of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (odds ratio, 8.4; P = .016) and in cases where patients had experienced an index VC during index hospitalization (odds ratio, 19.3; P = .001). Late vascular complications after peripheral ECMO cannulation are not rare, particularly after arterial cannulation. Patients should be followed closely early after surviving ECMO with wound evaluation and formal assessment of perfusion with ankle-branchial indices in the cannulated limb."

    "title": "Iatrogenic acute limb ischemia with complete traumatic rupture of the popliteal artery associated with total knee arthroplasty.",
    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia (ALI) related to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is rare. Most occlusions are caused by thrombus formation in the popliteal artery (PA). Currently such cases are revascularized using less invasive approaches such as endovascular therapy or Fogarty thrombectomy. We report a case of ALI in a 65-year-old woman with complete rupture of the PA due to a TKA procedure. She had resting pain and motor paralysis in her right lower extremity after TKA. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed occlusion of the right femoropopliteal artery. Subsequently, she was referred to our hospital with a diagnosis of ALI. Initially, a less invasive revascularization procedure was unsuccessfully attempted. Therefore, we performed an emergency distal bypass and succeeded in revascularization. Intraoperative examination revealed a complete rupture of the PA. Postoperatively, the patient exhibited no signs of myonephropathic metabolic syndrome. Although there was significant motor impairment, the affected limbs were successfully salvaged. ALI with complete rupture of the PA associated with TKA has not been reported previously. In cases of iatrogenic ALI after TKA, it would be essential to consider diagnostic and revascularization methods that account for the possibility of severe injury to the PA. Acute limb ischemia after total knee arthroplasty is a rare and life- and limb-threatening condition. The underlying pathological mechanism is often thrombus occlusion due to mechanical stimuli of the popliteal artery (PA). There are no established treatments for this condition, and less invasive approaches such as endovascular procedures and Fogarty thrombectomy are often used. However, in cases involving severe damage to the PA, bypass surgery may be necessary, and revascularization procedures should be considered accordingly."

    "abstract": "Vascular surgeons are often called upon to provide emergent surgical assistance to other specialties for iatrogenic complications, both intraoperatively and in the inpatient setting. The management of iatrogenic vascular injury remains a critical role of the vascular surgeon, especially in the context of the increasing adoption of percutaneous procedures by other specialties. This study aims to characterize consultation timing, management, and outcomes for iatrogenic vascular injuries. This study identified patients for whom vascular surgery was consulted for iatrogenic vascular complications from February 1, 2022, to May 12, 2023. Patient information, including demographic information, injury details, and details of any operative intervention, was retrospectively collected from February 1, 2022, to October 13, 2022, and prospectively collected for the remainder of the study period. Analyses were performed with R (version 2022.02.03). There were 87 patients with consultations related to iatrogenic vascular injury. Of these, 42 (46%) were female and the mean age was 59 years (±18 years). The most common consulting services were cardiology (32%), cardiothoracic surgery (26%), general surgery (8%), and neurointerventional radiology (10%). Reasons for consultation included hemorrhage (36%), limb ischemia (36%), and treatment of pseudoaneurysm (23%). A total of 24% of consults were intraoperative, 20% of consults related to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation cannulation, and 16% of consults related to ventricular assist devices including left ventricular assist device and intra-aortic balloon pump. The majority of these consult requests (60%) occurred during evening and night hours (5 PM to 7 AM). Emergent intervention was required in 62% of cases and consisted of primary open surgical repair of arterial injury (54%), endovascular intervention (21%), and open thromboembolectomy (15%). Overall, in-hospital mortality for the patient cohort was 20% and the reintervention rate was 23%, reflecting the underlying complexity of the illness and nature of the vascular injury in this patient group. Vascular surgeons play an essential role in managing emergent life-threatening hemorrhagic and ischemic iatrogenic vascular complications in the hospitalized setting. The complications require immediate bedside or intraoperative consult and often emergent open surgical or endovascular intervention. Furthermore, many of these require urgent management in the evening or overnight hours, and therefore the high frequency of these events represents a potential significant resource utilization and workforce issue to the vascular surgery workforce."

    "abstract": "Recent trends indicate a rise in the incidence of critical limb ischemia (CLI) among younger adults. This study examines trends in CLI hospitalization and outcomes among young adults with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in the United States. Adult hospitalizations (18-40 years) for PAD/CLI were analyzed from the 2016-2020 nationwide inpatient sample database using ICD-10 codes. Rates were reported per 1000 PAD or 100,000 cardiovascular disease admissions. Outcomes included trends in mortality, major amputations, revascularization, length of hospital stay (LOS), and hospital costs (THC). We used the Jonckheere-Terpstra tests for trend analysis and adjusted costs to the 2020 dollar using the consumer price index. Approximately 63,045 PAD and 20,455 CLI admissions were analyzed. The mean age of the CLI cohort was 32.7 ± 3 years. The majority (12,907; 63.1 %) were female and white (11,843; 57.9 %). Annual CLI rates showed an uptrend with 3265 hospitalizations (227 per 1000 PAD hospitalizations, 22.7 %) in 2016 to 4474 (252 per 1000 PAD hospitalizations, 25.2 %) in 2020 (Ptrend<0.001), along with an increase in PAD admissions from 14,405 (188 per 100,000, 0.19 %) in 2016 to 17,745 (232 per 100,000, 0.23 %%) in 2020 (Ptrend<0.0001). Annual in-hospital mortality increased from 570 (2.8 %) in 2016 to 803 (3.9 %) in 2020 (Ptrend = 0.001) while amputations increased from 1084 (33.2 %) in 2016 to 1995 (44.6 %) in 2020 (Ptrend<0.001). Mean LOS increased from 5.1 (SD 2.7) days in 2016 to 6.5 (SD 0.9) days in 2020 (Ptrend = 0.002). The mean THC for CLI increased from $50,873 to $69,262 in 2020 (Ptrend<0.001). The endovascular revascularization rates decreased from 11.5 % (525 cases) in 2016 to 10.7 % (635 cases) in 2020 (Ptrend = 0.025). Surgical revascularization rates also increased from 4.9 % (225 cases) in 2016 to 10.4 % (600 cases) in 2020 (Ptrend = 0.041). Hospitalization and outcomes for CLI worsened among young adults during the study period. There is an urgent need to enhance surveillance for risk factors of PAD in this age group."

    "title": "Factors Associated with Urgent Amputation Status and Its Impact on Mortality.",
    "abstract": "Thirty-day mortality is higher after urgent major lower extremity amputations compared to elective lower extremity amputations. This study aims to identify factors associated with urgent amputations and to examine their impact on perioperative outcomes and long-term mortality. Patients undergoing major lower limb amputation from 2013 to 2020 in the Vascular Quality Initiative were included. Urgent amputation was defined as occurring within 72 hr of admission. Associations with sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, and outcomes including postoperative complication, inpatient death, and long-term survival were compared using univariable tests and multivariable logistic regression. Long-term survival between groups was compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Of the 12,874 patients included, 4,850 (37.7%) had urgent and 8,024 (62.3%) had elective amputations. Non-White patients required urgent amputation more often than White patients (39.8% vs. 37.9%, P = 0.03). A higher proportion of Medicaid and self-pay patients presented urgently (Medicaid: 13.0% vs. 11.0%; self-pay: 3.4% vs. 2.5%, P < 0.001). Patients requiring urgent amputation were less often taking aspirin (55.6% vs. 60.1%, P < 0.001) or statin (62.2% vs. 67.2%, P < 0.001), had fewer prior revascularization procedures (41.0% vs. 48.8%, P < 0.001), and were of higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class 4-5 (50.9% vs. 40.1%, P < 0.001). Urgent amputations were more commonly for uncontrolled infection (48.1% vs. 29.4%, P < 0.001) or acute limb ischemia (14.3% vs. 6.2%, P < 0.001). Postoperative complications were higher after urgent amputations (34.7% vs. 16.6%, P < 0.001), including need for return to operating room (23.8% vs. 8.4%, P < 0.001) and need for higher revision (15.2% vs. 4.5%, P < 0.001). Inpatient mortality was higher after urgent amputation (8.9% vs. 5.4%, P < 0.001). Multivariable analysis revealed non-White race, self-pay, homelessness, current smoking, ASA class 4-5, and amputations for uncontrolled infection or acute limb ischemia were associated with urgent status, whereas living in a nursing home or prior revascularization were protective. Furthermore, urgent amputation was associated with an increased odds of postoperative complication or death (odds ratio 1.86 [1.69-2.04], P < 0.001) as well as long-term mortality (odds ratio: 1.24 [1.13-1.35], P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis corroborated that elective status was associated with improvement of long-term survival. Patients requiring urgent amputations are more often non-White, uninsured, and less frequently had prior revascularization procedures, revealing disparities in access to care. Urgency was associated with a higher postoperative complication rate, as well as increased long-term mortality. Efforts should be directed toward reducing these disparities to improve outcomes following amputation."

    "abstract": "Acute upper limb ischemia (AULI) is a medical and surgical emergency involving sudden decrease in limb perfusion resulting in threat for limb viability. A 52 years old male patient was suffered from AULI. He had the complaints of numbness and pain in left upper limb, headache and pale discoloration of left-hand fingers and acute onset left upper extremity weakness.The Ayurveda diagnosis was considered as Vatarakta. He was advised oral medications - Kaishor guggulu in the dose of 750 mg twice a day with Jwarhar kashaya 40 ml twice a day, Ashwagandha Churna 3 g, Guduchi churna1g, Shatavari churna 2 g, Chopchini churna 1 g with milk twice a day, Shilajatwadi loha 500 mg and Mahavatvidhvansana rasa 250 mg twice a day with honey. All these medications were continued for 12 months. Two courses of Mustadi yapana basti (medicated enema enriched with milk) and Shalishastika pinda swedana (a specific type of sudation with a poultice of rice bolus) and Nasya (nasal therapy) with Shadabindu oil were given. Initial computed tomography (CT) angiogram revealed the abrupt cutoff of the left brachial artery in distal part due to hypodense lesion (thrombus) in the lumen while after 12 months of treatment CT angiogram revealed 70-80 % luminal narrowing in proximal part of left ulnar artery. It suggests the revascularization of left ulnar artery. All the symptoms of AULI were also resolved. We report a unique case of AULI managed with Ayurvedic interventions."

    "abstract": "The radial artery has been used increasingly for percutaneous coronary intervention because of its safety and feasible access route. Nevertheless, transradial complications are possible because of the variation in radial artery anatomy. We experienced a case of the brachioradial artery injury secondary to catheterization, presenting as hypovolemic shock. A 76-year-old woman presented at our emergency department complaining of effort-induced angina. Coronary angiography via the right radial artery showed critical stenosis in the middle of the left anterior descending coronary artery. After wiring into this vessel, balloon angioplasty using a 6-Fr Judkin left guiding catheter was performed with the deployment of the zotarolimus-eluting stent. There was difficulty in negotiating the guidewire and balloons in that resistance was experienced while passing the catheter in the upper arm. Therefore, retrograde radial arteriography was performed to determine any injury to radial artery. This showed contrast extravasation in the brachioradial artery. Initially, manual compression was tried. However, 2 hours later, the patient developed cold sweating and went into a stupor. Laboratory findings showed a decline in hemoglobin, leading to suspicion of hemorrhagic shock. We applied over 30 minutes of balloon inflation, but this was ineffective. While surgical repair was not available, a 6.0 × 50 mm Viabahn stent was placed over the axillary artery. Subsequent angiography showed no further leakage or occlusion of the brachioradial artery. The postprocedural period was uneventful, and the patient was discharged with dual antiplatelet agents. At a 7-year clinical follow-up, the patient was free from limb ischemia symptoms."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic occlusion (AAO) is a rare but serious condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This review provides an emergency medicine focused evaluation of AAO, including presentation, assessment, and emergency department (ED) management based on current evidence. AAO refers to obstruction of blood flow through the aorta due to either thrombosis or embolism. This condition primarily affects older adults ages 60-70 with cardiovascular comorbidities and most commonly presents with signs and symptoms of acute limb ischemia, though the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and spinal cord may be affected. The first line imaging modality includes computed tomography angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. ED resuscitative management consists of avoiding extremes of blood pressure or heart rate, maintaining normal oxygen saturation and euvolemic status, anticoagulation with heparin, and pain control. Emergent consultation with the vascular surgery specialist is recommended to establish a plan for restoration of perfusion to ischemic tissues via endovascular or open techniques. High rates of baseline comorbidities present in the affected population as well as ischemic and reperfusion injuries place AAO patients at high risk for complications in an immediate and delayed fashion after surgical management. An understanding of AAO can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this rare but devastating disease."

Report why subjects undergoing cardiac procedures return urgently to the catheterization laboratory for a repeat procedure during the same day. We retrospectively reviewed patients who were brought back to the cardiac catheterization laboratory within the same day for a repeat procedure. The reasons for index and repeat procedure were identified. Patients who were transferred from an outside center after an initial procedure at other centers were excluded. Between November 2013 and January 2022, 55,942 catheterization procedures were performed at our institution, of which 140 entries were included in our analysis. Common reasons for the index procedure were diagnostic angiography (35.0%), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, 29.2%), and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (15.0%). The most common reason for bringing these patients back to the cardiac catheterization laboratory within the same day was vascular complications (24.2%), followed by repeat PCI (20.7%), need for hemodynamic support (15.0%), heart team discussion and PCI (10%), and pacemaker implantation (10%). Acute limb ischemia was the most commonly identified vascular complication (7.1%), followed by pseudoaneurysm (5%). Our study demonstrates that a very small number of patients underwent repeat procedures within the same day. Special attention should be paid to vascular access and closure and assessment of recurrent chest pain postprocedure, as these are the main reasons for same-day repeat procedures."

    "abstract": "We hypothesized that the severity of foot poikilothermy can be used for better differentiation of grades of acute limb ischemia. Thus, the study aim was evaluation of the value of non-contact foot thermometry, performed using a low-cost infrared medical thermometer, as an adjunct for clinical diagnosis of immediately threatened acute limb ischemia. It was a single-center observational prospective study performed over 3 years. Patients with acute limb ischemia of lower limbs grade I-IIB Rutherford treated with urgent revascularization were included. Grade of ischemia was determined independently by two experienced vascular surgeons. Thermometry of the ischemic foot was performed using a medical digital infrared non-contact thermometer (CK-T1501, Cooligg, China) with measuring accuracy of ±0.2°C. Temperature was measured in three points: the dorsal surface of the foot, plantar surface of the foot (both in the metatarsal region), and forehead. The maximal temperature gradient between patient's forehead and foot (∆Tmax F-F) was calculated. Measurements were repeated 6-12 h after revascularization. A total of 147 patients were included. Only 3 (2%) patients presented rest pain without sensory loss and motor deficit, while the majority were diagnosed with mild (63/147, 42.8%) or moderate (27/147, 18.3%) motor deficit. The temperature of the ischemic foot varied from 20 to 36.1°C, while median value of the temperature was 26.7 [24.5-29.9] °C on the dorsal surface and 26.8 [24.5-29.6] °C on the plantar surface of the foot (p = 0.85). Patients with Grade IIB ischemia had significantly lower dorsal foot temperature, plantar foot temperature, and larger ∆Tmax F-F than the patients with grades I-IIA: 25.1 [23.9-26.8] °C versus 29.9 [27.6-30.8] °C; 25.2 [23.8-27.5] °C versus 29.6 [28-31.1] °C; and 11.6 [9.7-12.8] °C versus 7.2 [6-9] °C (p < 0.0001). Areas under ROC curve for diagnosis of Grade IIB ischemia were similar for dorsal foot temperature (0.82), plantar temperature (0.81), and ∆Tmax F-F (0.82). The best cutoff value by Youden was ≥9.5°C for ∆Tmax F-F, ≤26.8°C for dorsal, and ≤27.7°C for plantar temperature. Criterion ∆Tmax F-F offered the highest specificity of 86% (95%CI 74.2-93.7) and positive predictive value of 89.2% (95%CI 79.5-93.2), while plantar temperature offered sensitivity of 82.5% (95%CI 70.1-91.3) and negative predictive value of 69.1% (95%CI 57.6-83.2). In multivariate analysis including age, gender, and etiology of arterial occlusion, the criterion ∆Tmax F-F of ≥9.5°C was a unique variable significantly associated with risk of amputation (adjusted OR 2.6, 95%CI 1.2-5.9, p = 0.01). Current study demonstrated that patients with immediately threatening ALI have significantly lower foot temperature than those with viable and marginally threatened limbs. Severe foot poikilothermy at admission is associated with poor outcomes of revascularization, mostly with limb loss."

    "abstract": "Surgery for type A aortic dissection (TAAD) is associated with a high risk of early mortality. The prognostic impact of a new classification of the urgency of the procedure was evaluated in this multicenter cohort study. Data on consecutive patients who underwent surgery for acute TAAD were retrospectively collected in the multicenter, retrospective European Registry of TAAD (ERTAAD). The rates of in-hospital mortality of 3,902 consecutive patients increased along with the ERTAAD procedure urgency grades: urgent procedure 10.0%, emergency procedure grade 1 13.3%, emergency procedure grade 2 22.1%, salvage procedure grade 1 45.6%, and salvage procedure grade 2 57.1% (p <0.0001). Preoperative arterial lactate correlated with the urgency grades. Inclusion of the ERTAAD procedure urgency classification significantly improved the area under the receiver operating characteristics curves of the regression model and the integrated discrimination indexes and the net reclassification indexes. The risk of postoperative stroke/global brain ischemia, mesenteric ischemia, lower limb ischemia, dialysis, and acute heart failure increased along with the urgency grades. In conclusion, the urgency of surgical repair of acute TAAD, which seems to have a significant impact on the risk of in-hospital mortality, may be useful to improve the stratification of the operative risk of these critically ill patients. This study showed that salvage surgery for TAAD is justified because half of the patients may survive to discharge."

    "abstract": "Although stroke and acute limb ischemia seem easily distinguishable by anamnesis and physical examination, symptoms may overlap and sometimes mislead the examiner. Such a situation can arise in the occurrence of unilateral neurological symptoms affecting the upper and lower limbs at the same time. As timely diagnosis and a correct therapeutic intervention are crucial to prevent irreversible damage in both diseases, knowledge of the possibility of one disease mimicking the other is essential. We present a unique case of acute unilateral upper and lower limb ischemia mimicking an acute stroke. A 69-year-old Caucasian patient with known atherosclerotic risk factors was admitted to the emergency department with a suspected stroke with unilateral paresthesia. After a comprehensive examination of the patient with the need for repeated reevaluation and a negative brain computed tomography scan, acute left-sided upper and lower limb ischemia was eventually diagnosed. The patient underwent surgical revascularization of the upper and lower limbs with a satisfactory result and was discharged from the hospital after a few days. It is of utmost importance to always stay alert for stroke mimics, as overlooking can lead to severe complications and delay adequate therapy. Our case shows that persistent diagnostic effort leads to successful treatment of the patient even on rare occasions, as is the acute unilateral upper and lower limb ischemia."

    "abstract": "Compartment syndrome, an exceptionally rare condition, is a surgical emergency that can quickly escalate to limb ischemia and necrosis without treatment. Most cases occur post-trauma, typically affecting the anterior compartment of the leg. Patients present with pain out of proportion to their physical examination findings and often have an early hallmark discovery of pain with passive extension. Compartment syndrome of the buttock requires an even higher index of suspicion, as the condition is even more uncommon, and the diagnosis is complicated by it being difficult to palpate the affected area and passively extend the leg when the patient is supine. This case report presents an 83-year-old female with compartment syndrome of the left gluteal region, status post-fall 1 day earlier. She was admitted to the medical team for observation and failed to respond to narcotic pain medication. The physical examination revealed firm, tense, left gluteal compartments with buttock hematoma and surrounding muscle induration, significant pain, and extremity weakness in the sciatic nerve distribution. An emergent fasciotomy was performed to decompress the affected compartments. All physicians must be mindful of gluteal compartment syndrome in patients complaining of buttock pain, especially after pelvic trauma, who present with buttock swelling, tense gluteal compartments, and severe gluteal pain. A delay in diagnosis or treatment can lead to severe consequences, including disability, irreversible gluteal muscle damage, sciatic nerve dysfunction, kidney failure, or death."

    "abstract": "Objective: To analyze the diagnosis and surgical treatment of high-risk anomalous aortic origin of coronary artery (AAOCA). Methods: This is a retrospective case series study. From January 2016 to July 2023, 24 cases of high-risk AAOCA underwent surgical treatment in Department of Cardiac Surgery, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital. There were 18 males and 6 females, operatively aged (M (IQR)) 13 (26) years (range: 0.3 to 57.0 years). They were confirmed by cardiac ultrasound and cardiac CT, all of which had anomalous coronary running between the aorta and the pulmonary artery. There were 15 cases of the right coronary artery from the left aortic sinus of Valsalva, 6 cases of left coronary artery from the right aortic sinus of Valsalva, 3 cases of the sigle coronary artery. Only 3 patients had no obvious related symptoms (2 cases were complicated with a positive exercise stress test and 1 case with other intracardiac malformations), 21 cases had a history of chest tightness, chest pain, or syncope after exercise. Three patients suffered syncope after exercise and underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (2 cases were treated with an extracorporeal membrane oxygenerator (ECMO)). The gap from the first symptom to the diagnosis was 4.0 (11.5) months (range: 0.2 to 84.0 months). The detection rate of coronary artery abnormalities suggested by the first cardiac ultrasound was only 37.5% (9/24). Seven patients were complicated with other cardiac diseases (4 cases with congenital heart defects, 2 cases with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease, 1 case with mitral valve disease). Results: All 24 patients underwent surgical treatment (23 cases underwent abnormal coronary artery unroofing, 1 case underwent coronary artery bypass grafting), and 5 patients underwent other intracardiac malformation correction at the same time. There were no death or surgery related complications in the hospital for 30 days after the operation. A patient with preoperative extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation was continuously assisted by ECMO after emergency AAOCA correction and had complications such as limb ischemia necrosis and renal dysfunction after the operation. During the follow-up of 2.2 (3.3) years (range: 1 month to 7.2 years), one patient who previously underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with a stent implant experienced significant postoperative symptomatic relief, and the other discharged patients had no related symptoms. Conclusions: The accurate rate of initial diagnosis for high-risk AAOCA is still low, but the risk of cardiovascular accidents is high. For sports-related chest pain and other symptoms, more attention should be paid to the detection of AAOCA, especially for adolescents. Exercise stress testing can be helpful in evaluating the cardiovascular risk of asymptomatic AAOCA. Instant surgical treatment can achieve satisfactory curative effects. 目的： 探讨高危冠状动脉异常主动脉起源（AAOCA）的诊断和治疗经验。 方法： 本研究为回顾性病例系列研究。回顾性分析2016年1月至2023年7月在广东省人民医院心外科接受外科手术的24例高危AAOCA患者的临床资料。男性18例，女性6例，手术时年龄［M（IQR）］13（26）岁（范围：0.3~57.0岁）。超声心动图和心脏CT检查确诊AAOCA，均走行于主动脉与肺动脉之间且合并狭窄。右冠状动脉起自左冠状窦15例，左冠状动脉起自右冠状窦6例，单一冠状动脉畸形3例。3例患者无明显相关症状，其中2例运动负荷试验阳性；21例患者有反复运动后胸闷、胸痛、晕厥等病史，其中3例患者出现运动后晕厥进行了心肺复苏。首次超声心动图提示冠状动脉异常的发现率为37.5%（9/24）。 结果： 24例患者均完成手术治疗，包括异常冠状动脉去顶手术23例，冠状动脉旁路移植术1例，其中5例患者同期完成其他心内畸形矫治手术。单纯AAOCA手术患者术中心肺转流时间（111.6±60.6）min（范围：62~213 min），主动脉阻断时间（57.6±25.3）min（范围：35~129 min）。术后院内30 d无死亡，无手术相关合并症。1例术前体外膜肺氧合持续辅助急诊手术患者术后出现肢端缺血坏死、肾功能不全等并发症。随访2.2（3.3）年（范围：1个月至7.2年），1例既往诊断冠心病行介入治疗患者术后症状明显减轻，其他出院患者无任何相关症状。 结论： 高危AAOCA的超声心动图初诊确诊率仍然较低，但心血管意外风险很高。对于运动相关的胸痛等症状应注意排查AAOCA，尤其是青少年。运动负荷试验可以有助于评估无症状AAOCA的心血管风险。外科手术治疗可获得满意的效果。."

    "title": "Percutaneous thrombectomy for acute limb ischemia is associated with equivalent limb and mortality outcomes compared with open thrombectomy.",
    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia (ALI) carries a 15% to 20% risk of combined death or amputation at 30 days and 50% to 60% at 1 year. Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (PT) is an emerging minimally invasive alternative to open thrombectomy (OT). However, ALI thrombectomy cases are omitted from most quality databases, limiting comparisons of limb and survival outcomes between PT and OT. Therefore, our aim was to compare in-hospital outcomes between PT and OT using the National Inpatient Sample. We analyzed survey-weighted National Inpatient Sample data (2015-2020) to include emergent admissions of aged adults (50+ years) with a primary diagnosis of lower extremity ALI undergoing index procedures within 2 days of hospitalization. We excluded hospitalizations with concurrent trauma or dissection diagnoses and index procedures using catheter-directed thrombolysis. Our primary outcome was composite in-hospital major amputation or death. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital major amputation, death, in-hospital reintervention (including angioplasty/stent, thrombolysis, PT, OT, or bypass), and extended length of stay (eLOS; defined as LOS >75th percentile). Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were generated by multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for demographics, frailty (Risk Analysis Index), secondary diagnoses including atrial fibrillation and peripheral artery disease, hospital characteristics, and index procedure data including the anatomic thrombectomy level and fasciotomy. A priori subgroup analyses were performed using interaction terms. We included 23,795 survey-weighted ALI hospitalizations (mean age: 72.2 years, 50.4% female, 79.2% White, and 22.3% frail), with 7335 (30.8%) undergoing PT. Hospitalization characteristics for PT vs OT differed by atrial fibrillation (28.7% vs 36.5%, P < .0001), frequency of intervention at the femoropopliteal level (86.2% vs 88.8%, P = .009), and fasciotomy (4.8% vs 6.9%, P = .006). In total, 2530 (10.6%) underwent major amputation or died. Unadjusted (10.1% vs 10.9%, P = .43) and adjusted (aOR = 0.96 [95% CI, 0.77-1.20], P = .74) risk did not differ between the groups. PT was associated with increased odds of reintervention (aOR = 2.10 [95% CI, 1.72-2.56], P < .0001) when compared with OT, but this was not seen in the tibial subgroup (aOR = 1.31 [95% CI, 0.86-2.01], P = .21, Pinteraction < .0001). Further, 79.1% of PT hospitalizations undergoing reintervention were salvaged with endovascular therapy. Lastly, PT was associated with significantly decreased odds of eLOS (aOR = 0.80 [95% CI, 0.69-0.94], P = .005). PT was associated with comparable in-hospital limb salvage and mortality rates compared with OT. Despite an increased risk of reintervention, most PT reinterventions avoided open surgery, and PT was associated with a decreased risk of eLOS. Thus, PT may be an appropriate alternative to OT in appropriately selected patients."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is a condition in which there is an intimal tear that allows the blood to pass through the tear and into the aortic media, splitting to a true lumen and a newly formed false lumen. It is associated with genetic disorders such as Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and Loeys-Dietz syndrome, or may result from cardiovascular risk factors including smoking, hypertension, and familial hyperlipidemia. The aim this article was to report a complicated Stanford B aortic dissection with acute limb ischemia and compartment syndrome, successfully managed with limb preservation and aortic repair. A 60s male patient with poorly controlled hypertension presented with severe chest pain radiating to the back and right leg ischemia, characterized by coldness, numbness, motor loss, and absent arterial pulses. The patient was treated with intensive medical management, including pain control, heart rate and blood pressure stabilization, while preparing for emergency intervention. A thoracic aortic endovascular stent-graft was placed to seal the entry tear and restore blood flow to the right lower limb. The intervention utilized a Relay thoracic stent-graft (32-28 mm diameter, 200 cm length, Bolton Medical), with access via the left common femoral artery Stanford Type B aortic dissection complicated by limb ischemia is a cardiovascular emergency requiring urgent intervention. Timely monitoring, insight consultation with orthopedic physician to understand the pathophysiology of acute compartment syndrome, the importance of early diagnosis and precise management of acute compartment syndrome following intervention are crucial to preserving the limb and ensuring the success of endovascular aortic repair."

    "abstract": "Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs) affect approximately 5.9/100,000 persons per year, with a male:female ratio of approximately 1.5-1.7:1. Data exploring sex-related variations in epidemiology and clinical presentation are scarce, as women are normally under-represented in clinical trials. As female hormones and their receptors greatly impact the functions of the vascular cells and aneurysm etiology and extent, the age at surgery and comorbidities also differ between men and women. Additionally, female patients have smaller anatomic structures, including visceral/infrarenal aorta and iliac arteries, than most men. Thus, aneurysms of a certain diameter can represent more advanced disease in women comparatively, than the same-sized aneurysms in males, and be the cause of delayed and often emergent treatment. Adjusting the aortic diameter threshold is recommended for surgery using aortic size index (ASI) [aortic diameter in cm/body surface area (BSA) in m2] or aortic height index (AHI) (aortic diameter in cm/patient height in m) indices in patients who are significantly shorter or taller than average, but no specific sex-related size criteria have been indicated so far for TAAA. Data about TAAA outcomes are conflicting, but female sex has been demonstrated to be an independent risk factor for increased major postoperative complications (i.e., bleeding, acute limb ischemia, renal failure, bowel ischemia, spinal cord ischemia) with longer hospital and intensive unit care stay and in-hospital and 30-day mortality following endovascular treatment and increased long-term mortality following open repair. Despite this evidence, sex does not influence TAAA management strategies and currently the allocation to open or endovascular repair is based on anatomy and clinical setting. In light of these disadvantaged outcomes, further efforts are needed to better understand the sex-related differences in the TAAA diagnosis and management in order to allow prompt and appropriate treatment of female patients."

    "abstract": "Patients with symptomatic lower-extremity peripheral artery disease (LE-PAD) are prone to serious cardiovascular and limb events. Few studies have evaluated the effect of rivaroxaban-based dual antithrombotic therapy in high-risk patients with LE-PAD in Asian populations. To investigate the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban-based dual antithrombotic therapy in symptomatic patients with LE-PAD. Retrospective cohort study. This study included patients with LE-PAD treated at the Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2021. These participants were divided into antiplatelet (APT) or antiplatelet therapy combined with rivaroxaban (RAPT) groups. The efficacy outcomes in this study were the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes, and major adverse limb events (MALE), including urgent revascularization, acute limb ischemia, and major amputation. The safety outcomes included major and clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding. Patients were followed up until the time of death or the end of the study (31 March 2023). We included 1144 patients with LE-PAD (APT: 502 patients; RAPT: 642 patients). The RAPT group had a lower risk of primary composite efficacy outcomes [hazard ratio (HR): 0.40] and a nonsignificant increase in major bleeding risk (HR: 2.33) than the APT group. The RATP group also had a significantly lower risk of secondary efficacy outcomes, including ischemic stroke (HR: 0.41), myocardial infarction (HR: 0.31), cardiovascular death (HR: 0.40), and MALE (HR: 0.65), than the APT group. The CRNM bleeding incidence varied between the two groups (HR: 3.96). Moreover, no significant interactions were observed between the subgroups and treatment groups in the composite efficacy analysis. Rivaroxaban-based dual antithrombotic therapy significantly reduced the occurrence of MACE in patients with LE-PAD without increasing major bleeding events. High-risk patients benefited from the dual antithrombotic therapy. Comparison of rivaroxaban-based dual antithrombotic and antiplatelet therapies for symptomatic patients with lower-extremity peripheral artery disease post-revascularization: a retrospective cohort study. Serious cardiovascular and limb events are common adverse effects in patients with symptomatic lower-extremity peripheral artery disease (LE-PAD).Few studies have reported the benefits of dual antithrombotic therapy with rivaroxaban in patients with high risk of LE-PAD in Asian populations. We collected data from in-patients with LE-PAD from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2021.Depending on the antithrombotic medication administered, we classified the patients into antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin and clopidogrel; APT group) and antiplatelet therapy combined with rivaroxaban (RAPT group) groups.The primary efficacy outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), which was a composite of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke or death from cardiovascular causes. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding.Secondary clinical outcomes included myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, death from cardiovascular causes, clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding, and major adverse limb events (MALE), including urgent revascularization, acute limb ischemia, and major amputation.Follow-up continued until death or the end of the study (March 31, 2023). The RAPT group had a lower risk of primary composite efficacy outcome and a non-significant increase in the risk of major bleeding than the APT group.The risk of secondary efficacy was significantly lower in the RAPT group than in the APT groups. The incidence of CRNM bleeding varied between the two groups.The subgroups and treatment groups had no significant interactions with the risk of composite efficacy outcomes. Rivaroxaban-based dual antithrombotic therapy has a clear therapeutic advantage over single antiplatelet therapy in Asian populations and does not increase the risk of major bleeding.Rivaroxaban-based combination therapy reduces the risk of serious adverse cardiovascular and limb events with an acceptable safety profile."

    "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the most common form of acute leukemia, is an aggressive lethal hematological malignancy that mainly occurs in older adults with a slightly higher predominance in males. It is prompted by the clonal expansion of immature myeloid blasts in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and/or extramedullary tissues. Leukostasis in AML is a critical medical condition mainly affecting the lungs and brain and arises when tissue perfusion is compromised due to the clustering of white blood cells (WBCs) within the microvasculature. Cardiac involvement in this condition is exceptionally uncommon. Here, we present a case of a 56-year-old man, recently diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia M4 and leukostasis, who developed acute anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction six days after presentation and in whom emergent coronary angiography showed proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery lesion with a large clot obstructing the flow and thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) I flow, and urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was done; thromboaspiration and drug-coated balloon angioplasty were performed with good angiographic results. Antiplatelet (aspirin and clopidogrel) and anticoagulation (enoxaparin) were started immediately before PCI. Emergent leukapheresis was initiated in addition to hydroxyurea with complete resolution of chest pain. Four days post PCI, the patient developed right-sided hemiparesis with an evident infarct on a CT scan of the brain, and he also developed acute limb ischemia involving the distal right foot. Five days post PCI, the patient had a sudden sustained ventricular tachycardia followed immediately by asystole, and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation was done for 25 minutes but with no response."

    "abstract": "Lower limb ischemia-reperfusion is a common pathological process during clinical surgery. Because lower limb ischemia-reperfusion usually aggravates ischemia-induced skeletal muscle tissue injury after lower limb ischemia-reperfusion, it also causes remote organ heart, intestine, liver, lung and other injuries, and there is no effective clinical treatment for lower limb ischemia-reperfusion injury, so it is urgent to study its injury mechanism. In this study, the rat model of lower limb ischemia-reperfusion was established by clamping the femoral artery with microarterial clips, and the wall destruction such as intimal injury, cell edema, collagen degeneration, neutrophil infiltration, and elastic fiberboard injury of the femoral artery wall was detected. The expression of inflammatory factors was detected by immunohistochemistry. miR-206 preconditioning was used to observe the expression of inflammatory factors, redox status and apoptosis in the vascular wall of rats after acute limb ischemia-reperfusion. Our findings suggest that vascular endothelial cell edema increases, wall thickening, neutrophil infiltration, and elastic fiber layer damage during IRI. Inflammatory factor expression was increased in femoral artery tissue, and miR-206 expression levels were significantly down-regulated. Further studies have found that miR-206 attenuates lower limb IRI by regulating the effects of phase inflammatory factors. In this study, we investigated the effect of miR-206 on inflammatory factors and its possible role in the development of lower limb IRI, providing new research ideas for the regulatory mechanism of lower limb IRI, and providing a certain theoretical basis for the treatment of lower limb ischemia-reperfusion injury after surgery or endovascular intervention."

    "abstract": "A 71-year-old woman with no relevant previous medical history presented to the emergency department with cardiopulmonary arrest due to extensive myocardial infarction. Veno-arterial extracorporeal life support (ECLS) was passed through the right common femoral artery (CFA), and an Impella CP® (16-F introduction sheath, Abiomed Inc., Danvers, MA, USA) was inserted from the left CFA. Although these mechanical devices provide powerful cardiac and organ support, an occlusive large-bore sheath may induce ischemic limb complications. Antegrade flow from the contralateral sheath was circulated through the ECLS circuit, showing the improvement of antegrade left SFA. Cardiac function improved after primary percutaneous coronary intervention, but when the ECLS was terminated, antegrade left limb flow declined. Hence, we bypassed the contralateral flow via the dialysis circuit and prevented limb ischemia. Although an Impella® (Abiomed Inc., Danvers, MA, USA) is useful for assisting left ventricular cardiac function, its large-bore sheath sometimes disturbs the antegrade flow, resulting in ischemic limb complications. A novel yet simple technique that involves an external bypass through the superficial femoral artery to provide antegrade perfusion to the ipsilateral limb is hereby described."

This is particularly relevant given the current lack of well-established guidelines. Acute upper limb ischemia is rarely seen in Horton's disease. We present a case of a 63-year-old female patient with sub-acute ischemia in both upper limbs, accompanied by jaw claudication and absence of bilateral temporal pulses. The CT Angiography scan revealed bilateral occlusions and stenosis of the axillary and sub-clavier arteries, as well as involvement of the external carotid arteries and its branches. The Arteriography confirmed abnormalities in the medium-sized arteries of the supra-aortic trunks. The histopathology examination of the temporal artery biopsy was negative. The patient received emergency corticosteroid therapy followed by an immunosuppressant. Due to the improved clinical condition of the upper limbs, surgical intervention was not performed."

In this report, we present a rare case of an 86-year-old man with chronic limb-threatening ischemia who developed delayed rupture of an idiopathic pseudoaneurysm of the peroneal artery (PA) following EVT. The PA chronic total occlusion (CTO) was successfully crossed using a guidewire via an antegrade approach, however, subintimal crossing was confirmed by intravascular ultrasound. Balloon angioplasty was then performed using an appropriately sized balloon, resulting in successful recanalization of the PA CTO with minor dissection and no complications. Postoperatively, the patient's condition was stable until he suddenly complained of right calf pain 10 days after EVT. Computed tomography revealed a rupture of the PA pseudoaneurysm. Urgent angiography revealed two pseudoaneurysms, one saccular and the other spindle-shaped. The ruptured saccular aneurysm was successfully excluded through coil embolization and stent graft placement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of delayed rupture of a BTK pseudoaneurysm following EVT. Balloon angioplasty in the subintimal space can lead to the formation of a pseudoaneurysm and its delayed rupture."

    "abstract": "Weekend presentation has been associated with adverse outcomes in emergent conditions, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and critical limb ischemia. We examine whether a weekend effect exists in the management of and outcomes after extremity degloving injuries. The cohort included adults presenting with open extremity degloving injuries to a tertiary level one trauma center between June 2018 and May 2022. We collected demographics, comorbidities, injury information, interventions, and complications. Propensity score weighting was used to minimize confounding differences between those presenting on weekends (Sat-Sun) versus weekdays (Mon-Fri). Weighted regressions were used to examine differences in interventions by day of presentation. Multivariable weighted regressions accounting for differences in interventions received were used to examine whether weekend presentation was associated with amputation risk, complications, or functional deficits. Ninety-five patients with 100 open extremity degloving injuries were included. In total, 39% of injuries were weekend-presenting. There was a higher rate of noninsulin-dependent diabetes among patients presenting on weekends (P = 0.03). Weekend-presenting injuries had higher median Injury Severity Scores (P = 0.04). Propensity-weighted regression analysis revealed differences in interventions received on weekends, including lower rates of pedicled and free flaps and bone graft, and increased rates of negative-pressure wound therapy (P ≤ 0.02). Multivariable regression analysis revealed weekend presentation was a significant independent risk factor for amputation of the affected extremity [odds ratio 2.27, 95% CI (1.01-5.33), P = 0.05]. Weekend presentation may impact interventions received and amputation risk in patients presenting with open extremity degloving injuries."

    "title": "High risk and low prevalence diseases: Acute limb ischemia.",
    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia is a rare but serious condition that carries with it a high rate of morbidity and mortality. This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of acute limb ischemia, including presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence. Acute limb ischemia is defined as a sudden decrease in limb perfusion resulting in cessation of blood flow and nutrient and oxygen delivery to the tissues. This leads to cellular injury and necrosis, ultimately resulting in limb loss and potentially systemic symptoms with significant morbidity and mortality. There are several etiologies including native arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis after an intervention, arterial embolus, and arterial injury. Patients with acute limb ischemia most commonly present with severe pain and sensory changes in the initial stages, with prolonged ischemia resulting in weakness, sensory loss, and color changes to the affected limb. The emergency clinician should consult the vascular specialist as soon as ischemia is suspected, as the diagnosis should be based on the history and examination. Computed tomography angiography is the first line imaging modality, as it provides valuable information concerning the vasculature and surrounding tissues. Doppler ultrasound of the distal pulses may also be obtained to evaluate for arterial and venous flow. Once identified, management includes intravenous unfractionated heparin and vascular specialist consultation for revascularization. An understanding of acute limb ischemia can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this potentially deadly disease."

    "abstract": "Popliteal artery aneurysms (PAAs) need urgent treatment in case of acute thrombosis, distal embolization, or rupture. Few data are available in the literature about the treatment results in these scenarios. The aim of the present study was to evaluate an 11-year multicenter experience in the urgent treatment of PAAs. All symptomatic PAAs surgically treated in two vascular centers between 2010 and 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. In the postoperative period periodical clinical and Duplex-Ultrasound evaluation were performed. The evaluated endpoint was the outcome of urgent PAAs treatment according to their clinical presentation. Statistical analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier log-rank evaluation and multivariable Cox regression tests. Sixty-six PAAs needed an urgent repair. Twelve (18%) patients had a PAA rupture and 54 (82%) had an acute limb ischemia (ALI) due to either distal embolization or acute thrombosis. Patients with ALI underwent bypass surgery in 51 (95%) cases, which was associated with preoperative thrombolysis in 18 (31%) cases. A primary major amputation was performed in 3 (5%) cases. The mean follow-up was 52 ± 21 months with an overall 5-year limb salvage of 83 ± 6%. Limb salvage was influenced only by the number of patent tibial arteries (pTA) [5-years limb salvage 0%, 86 ± 10%, 92 ± 8% and 100% in case of 0, 1, 2 or 3 pTA, respectively (P = .001)]. An independent association of number of pTA and limb loss was found [hazard ratio (HR): 0.14 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03-0.6), P = .001]. Overall 5-year survival was 71 ± 7%. Ruptured PAAs were associated with lower 5-year survival compared with the ALI group (48 ± 2% vs. 79 ± 7%, P = .001). The number of pTA (33 ± 20%, 65 ± 10%, 84 ± 10% and 80 ± 10% for 0, 1, 2 and 3 pTA, respectively, P = .001) and the thrombolysis (94 ± 6% vs. 62 ± 10%, P = .03) were associated with higher survival in patients with ALI. There was an independent association of number of pTA and long-term survival [HR 0.15 (95% CI 0.03-0.8), P = .03]. PAA rupture is the cause of urgent PAA treatment in almost one fifth of cases, and it is associated with lower long-term survival. ALI can benefit from thrombolysis, and long-term limb salvage and survival are associated with the number of pTA."

The aim of this study was to describe the management of suspected axillary artery injury associated with PHF according to our experience and to describe a new multidisciplinary surgical approach. This was a single-center retrospective study. A database was created for patients admitted for PHF to the emergency department of the Hospital of Cannes between October 2017 and October 2019. Patients admitted with PHF associated with suspected ipsilateral upper limb ischemia, and/or massive diaphysis displacement, and/or upper limb ipsilateral neurological deficits were included in this study. In total, 301 patients diagnosed with PHF were admitted within these periods. Among these patients, 12 presented with suspected axillary artery lesions, of whom, 6 were included in the present study and treated according to our new approach. A description of these 6 cases, along with an extensive literature review is presented.

The present report describes the case of a patient who developed ALI after treatment of IC at another facility, with malpositioned bilateral common iliac stents, continuous stent extension into the popliteal artery, and acute occlusion of the entirety of the right lower extremity vasculature. This case illustrates how extensive endovascular intervention for IC can result in ALI requiring urgent revascularization."

    "abstract": "Studies suggest that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2014 has improved access to vascular care and vascular outcomes among patients suffering from peripheral arterial disease (PAD). We sought to examine the racial disparities that exist in patients with PAD who have undergone lower extremity bypass (LEB) or a peripheral vascular intervention (PVI) using the Vascular Quality initiative (VQI) database. The VQI infrainguinal and PVI datasets were queried for patients receiving elective and urgent LEB or PVI between 2016, 2 years after ACA implementation, and in 2021. Patients undergoing interventions urgently/emergently or for aneurysm were excluded. The primary outcome was major adverse limb event (MALE-defined as any vascular reintervention or above-ankle amputation) free survival at 1 year. Standard statistical methods were utilized as appropriate. A total of 17,455 LEB and 87,475 PVIs were included in this analysis. Black persons present at a younger age when compared to non-Hispanic White persons (NHW) and are more likely to have diabetes, hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and higher rates of prior amputation. Black persons are more likely to present with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) rather than claudication, and in a more urgent setting. Postoperative outcomes show higher rates of major amputations among racial minorities, specifically Black persons for both LEB (1.8% vs. 0.8% P < 0.001) and PVI (20.8% vs. 16.8% P < 0.001). Black persons are at higher risk of 1-year MALE for LEB (36.7% vs. 29.9% P < 0.001) and PVI (31.0% vs. 21.7%; P < 0.001). Even after adjusting for confounding variables, Black persons have a higher risk of 1-year MALE for LEB, with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 1.15 (95% CI [1.05-1.26], P = 0.003) and PVI (aHR 1.18 95% CI [1.12-1.24], P < 0.001). Other major determinates of 1-year MALE on multivariate Cox regression included CLTI (LEB aHR 1.57 95% CI [1.43-1.72], P < 0.001; PVI aHR 2.29 95% CI [2.20-2.39], P < 0.001) and history of prior amputation (LEB aHR 1.35 95% CI [1.17-1.56], P < 0.001; PVI aHR 1.5 95% CI [1.4-1.6], P < 0.001). Compared to NHW persons, Black persons present with more advanced vascular disease regardless of the operative indication. Black persons are also at significantly higher risk of 1-year MALE. Despite some advances in more accessible care through the ACA of 2014, our observations suggest that Black persons still have significantly worse outcomes due to variety of variables that need further investigation."

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and diabetes are the major causes of lower extremity amputations (LEAs) worldwide. Morbidity and mortality in patients with LEAs are high with an associated significant burden on the global health system. The aim of this article is to report the overall morbidity and mortality rates after major and minor LEAs from the Serbian Vascular Registry (SerbVasc), with an analysis of predictive factors that influenced adverse outcomes. SerbVasc was created in 2019 as a part of the Vascunet collaboration that is aiming to include all vascular procedures from 21 hospitals in Serbia. Prevalence of diabetes among patients with LEAs, previous revascularization procedures, the degree and the type of foot infection and tissue loss, and overall morbidity and mortality rates were analyzed, with a special reference to mortality predictors. In the period from January 2020 to December 2022, data on 702 patients with LEAs were extracted from the SerbVasc registry, mean age of 69.06±10.63 years. Major LEAs were performed in 59%, while minor LEAs in 41% of patients. Diabetes was seen in 65.1% of the patients, with 44% of them being on insulin therapy. Before LEA, only 20.3% of patients had previous peripheral revascularization. Soft tissue infection, irreversible acute ischemia, and Fontaine III and IV grade ischemia were the most common causes of above-the-knee amputations while diabetic foot was the most common cause of transphalangeal and toe amputations. The infection rate was 3.7%, the re-amputation rate was 5.7%, and the overall mortality rate was 6.9%, with intrahospital mortality in patients with above-the-knee amputation of 11.1%. The most significant intrahospital mortality predictors were age >65 years (p<0.001), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (p<0.001), ischemic heart disease (IHD) (p=0.001), previous myocardial revascularization (p=0.017), emergency type of admission (p<0.001), not using aspirin (p=0.041), using previous anticoagulation therapy (p=0.003), and postoperative complications (p<0.001). The main predictors of increased mortality after LEAs from the SerbVasc registry are age >65 years, CKD, IHD, previous myocardial revascularization, emergency type of admission, not using aspirin, using previous anticoagulation therapy, and postoperative complications. Taking into account high mortality rates after LEAs and a small proportion of previous peripheral revascularization, the work should be done on early diagnosis and timely treatment of PAD hopefully leading to decreased number of LEAs and overall mortality.Clinical ImpactMortality after lower limb amputation from the SerbVasc register is high. A small number of previously revascularized patients is of particular clinical importance, bearing in mind that the main reasons for above-the-knee amputations were irreversible ischemia, Fontaine III and Fontaine IV grade ischemia. Lack of diagnostics procedures and late recognition of patients with PAD, led to subsequent threating limb ischemia and increased amputation rates. The work should be done on early diagnosis and timely treatment of PAD in Serbia, hopefully leading to an increased number of PAD procedures, decreased number of LEAs, and lower overall mortality."

    "abstract": "We present the first documented case of achieving surgical anesthesia for a vascular surgery using the suprainguinal approach of the fascia iliaca compartment block (SFICB), in a patient with severe comorbidities from the cardiovascular system. More specifically, a male elderly patient with a history of cardiac amyloidosis, severe aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease, was in need of emergent thrombectomy due to acute lower limb ischemia. During the evaluation of this patient, general and neuraxial anesthesia were both considered. However, the former would expose him to the risk of myocardial ischemia and other complications due to cardiovascular instability caused by the general anesthetic agents while the latter was absolutely contraindicated due to recent clopidogrel use and the specific pathophysiology changes induced by cardiac amyloidosis. Thus, a peripheral nerve block was deemed to be the best option in this case. SFICB, despite being challenging, could offer adequate analgesic results so it was the anesthetic technique of choice. The surgery was completed and the patient recovered appropriately. The aim of this report is to discuss the specific anesthetic considerations of this case, highlight the ability of SFICB to achieve surgical anesthesia in vascular surgeries, and increase familiarity with the procedure."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the clinical effectiveness of the SilverFlow branch stent through endovascular isolation and in situ fenestration (ISF) for the treatment of aortic dissection (AD) involving the aortic arch. A total of 21 patients with AD involving the aortic arch, admitted to our hospital between September 2021 and January 2023, were selected for this prospective study. All patients underwent treatment with an endoluminal isolated ISF-covered stent, with the branch stent being the SilverFlow, developed by Shenzhen Xianjian Company. We assessed the success rate of the ISF procedure stent-related complications and compared the volumes of the true and false cavities before and after treatment. Follow-up evaluations were conducted 1, 3, and 6 months post-operation, focusing on neurological complications, mortality, and the need for secondary interventional treatment. Among the 21 AD patients with aortic arch involvement, 20 (95.23%) underwent non-emergency surgery, while 1 (4.76%) required emergency surgery due to cardiac ischemia and signs of dissection rupture. All surgeries were successfully completed. After treatment, the average volume of the true lumen significantly decreased compared to pre-treatment levels, while the volume of the false lumen significantly increased (P < .05). The success rate was 100%, with only one case (4.76%) experiencing type I internal leakage. There were no cases of stent displacement, distortion, or fenestration vessel occlusion. One patient (4.76%) succumbed to acute pericardial tamponade, resulting in a mortality rate of 4.76%. Another patient (4.76%) suffered from upper limb ischemia, significantly improving with antithrombotic drug treatment. No occurrences of stroke, visceral ischemia, or other complications were reported, and no secondary interventional treatments were required. The application of the SilverFlow branch stent for endovascular isolation of ISF in AD cases involving the aortic arch demonstrates a high success rate, low complication and mortality rates, and significant clinical feasibility and value."

    "title": "Patients with Acute Limb Ischemia Might Benefit from Endovascular Therapy-A 17-Year Retrospective Single-Center Series of 985 Patients.",
    "abstract": "Acute lower limb ischemia (ALI) is a common vascular emergency, requiring urgent revascularization by open or endovascular means. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate patient demographics, treatment and periprocedural variables affecting the outcome in ALI patients in a consecutive cohort in a tertiary referral center. Primary outcome events (POE) were 30-day (safety) and 180-day (efficacy) combined mortality and major amputation rates, respectively. Secondary outcomes were perioperative medical and surgical leg-related complications and the 5-year combined mortality and major amputation rate. Statistical analysis used descriptive and uni- and multivariable Cox regression analysis. In 985 patients (71 ± 9 years, 56% men) from 2004 to 2020, the 30-day and 180-day combined mortality and major amputation rates were 15% and 27%. Upon multivariable analysis, older age (30 d: aHR 1.17; 180 d: 1.27) and advanced Rutherford ischemia stage significantly worsened the safety and efficacy POE (30 d: TASC IIa aHR 3.29, TASC IIb aHR 3.93, TASC III aHR 7.79; 180 d: TASC IIa aHR 1.97, TASC IIb aHR 2.43, TASC III aHR 4.2), while endovascular treatment was associated with significant improved POE after 30 days (aHR 0.35) and 180 days (aHR 0.39), respectively. Looking at five consecutive patient quintiles, a significant increase in endovascular procedures especially in the last quintile could be observed (17.5% to 39.5%, p < 0.001). Simultaneously, the re-occlusion rate as well as the number of patients with any previous revascularization increased. In conclusion, despite a slightly increasing early re-occlusion rate, endovascular treatment might, if possible, be favorable in ALI treatment."

    "abstract": "PAD frequently co-occurs with diabetes, often leading to chronic nonhealing wounds. Foot gangrene and amputation are common outcomes of untreated CLI. A 67-year-old male with diabetes and deteriorating limb ischemia following surgical stress underwent successful surgical repair after emergency PTA of the SFA for extensive heel necrosis. After surgical debridement of necrotic heel tissue, the ABI on the affected side suddenly reduced to 0.36, but it improved to 1.06 at 4 weeks following stenting angioplasty, allowing the subsequent flap surgery to repair the heel defect. At the 1-year follow-up visit, the patient exhibited durable heel coverage and the restoration of weightbearing function. No signs or symptoms indicative of restenosis were evident in the blood vessel treated with stent angioplasty. This case highlights the importance of proper evaluation of critical ischemic conditions and the need for prompt endovascular interventions in preserving the at-risk diabetic foot."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is a limb- and life-threatening condition and urgent treatment including revascularization should be offered to patients unless the limb is irreversibly ischemic. The aim of this study was to investigate 1-year clinical outcomes and prognostic factors following revascularization in patients with ALI. A retrospective, multicenter, nonrandomized study examined 185 consecutive patients with ALI treated by surgical revascularization (SR), endovascular revascularization (ER), or hybrid revascularization (HR) in 6 Japanese medical centers from January 2015 to August 2021. The 1-year amputation-free survival (AFS) rate was estimated to be 69.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 62.8-76.2%). There were no significant differences among SR, ER, and HR regarding both technical success and perioperative complications. Multivariate analysis revealed that Rutherford category IIb and III ischemia (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.06-3.25), supra- to infrapopliteal lesion (HR: 2.06; 95% CI: 1.08-3.95), and technical failure (HR: 2.58; 95% CI: 1.49-4.46) were independent risk factors for 1-year AFS. Rutherford category IIb and III ischemia, supra- to infrapopliteal lesions, and technical failures were identified as independent risk factors for 1-year AFS. Furthermore, patients with multiple risk factors had a lower AFS rate."

These interventions require adequate platelet count and functionality. Anticoagulation and surgery can be complicated in thrombocytopenic patients and require interdisciplinary management for optimal outcomes, as literature is limited in this population. We present a case of a patient with severe thrombocytopenia who developed limb ischemia from cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT). We propose a management strategy for anticoagulation and perioperative platelet transfusion, with successful revascularization without adverse bleeding events. While successful, more data is required to investigate long-term outcomes."

    "abstract": "In the increasingly prevalent hub-and-spoke health system model, specialized services are centralized at a hub hospital, while spoke hospitals offer more limited services and transfer patients to the hub as needed. In one urban, academic health system, a community hospital without procedural capabilities was recently incorporated as a spoke. The goal of this study was to assess the timeliness of emergent procedures for patients presenting to the spoke hospital under this model. The authors performed a retrospective cohort study of patients transferred from the spoke hospital to the hub hospital for emergency procedures after the health system restructuring (April 2021-October 2022). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who arrived within their goal transfer time. Secondary outcomes were time from transfer request to procedure start and whether procedure start occurred within guideline-recommended treatment time frames for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI), and acute limb ischemia (ALI). A total of 335 patients were transferred for emergency procedural intervention during the study period, most commonly for interventional cardiology (23.9%), endoscopy or colonoscopy (11.0%), or bone or soft tissue debridement (10.7%). Overall, 65.7% of patients were transferred within the goal time. 23.5% of patients with STEMI met goal door-to-balloon time, and more patients with NSTI (55.6%) and ALI (100%) underwent intervention within the guideline-recommended time frame. A hub-and-spoke health system model can provide access to specialized procedures in a high-volume, resource-rich setting. However, ongoing performance improvement is required to ensure that patients with emergency conditions receive timely intervention."

This article aims to describe a clinical case and revise the literature about Buerger's disease. A 45-year-old smoker male repeatedly visited the emergency department for refractory pain and inflammatory signs in the right hallux. After developing ulcers in the right foot, Doppler ultrasonography revealed segmental occlusion of distal arteries of that limb. It was also observed in arteriography \"corkscrew\" collaterals. Autoimmune, thrombophilic and cardiovascular diseases were excluded. Analgesia, antibiotics and alprostadil were implemented. As a result, the patient stopped smoking and was submitted to minor amputation with complete healing, after which he remained asymptomatic. Buerger's disease is a diagnosis of exclusion. Therefore, smoking cessation is the most effective treatment and is crucial to prevent disease progression."

    "abstract": "Evidence increasingly shows that the risk of thrombotic complications in COVID-19 is associated with a hypercoagulable state. Several organizations have released guidelines for the management of COVID-19-related coagulopathy and prevention of VTE. However, an urgent need exists for practical guidance on the management of arterial thrombosis and thromboembolism in this setting. What is the current available evidence informing the prevention and management of arterial thrombosis and thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19? A group of approved panelists developed key clinical questions by using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) format that address urgent clinical questions regarding prevention and management of arterial thrombosis and thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19. Using MEDLINE via PubMed, a literature search was conducted and references were screened for inclusion. Data from included studies were summarized and reviewed by the panel. Consensus for the direction and strength of recommendations was achieved using a modified Delphi survey. The review and analysis of the literature based on 11 PICO questions resulted in 11 recommendations. Overall, a low quality of evidence specific to the population with COVID-19 was found. Consequently, many of the recommendations were based on indirect evidence and prior guidelines in similar populations without COVID-19. The existing evidence and panel consensus do not suggest a major departure from the management of arterial thrombosis according to recommendations predating the COVID-19 pandemic. Data on the optimal strategies for prevention and management of arterial thrombosis and thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19 are sparse. More high-quality evidence is needed to inform management strategies in these patients."

    "abstract": "Through significant advances in the treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease, acute ischemia of the lower extremity is still associated with significant morbidity, limb threat and mortality. The two main causes of acute ischemia in lower extremities are arterial embolism and atherosclerotic arteries. Timely recognition and treatment of acute limb ischemia in emergency situations is essential in order to minimize the duration of ischemia. To investigate the application effect of angiojet thrombolysis in the treatment of acute lower extremity arterial embolization. Sixty-two patients with acute lower extremity arterial embolization admitted to our hospital from May 2018 to May 2020 were selected. Among them, the observation group (twenty-eight cases) had received angiojet thrombolysis, and the control group (thirty-four cases) had received femoral artery incision and thrombectomy. After thrombus clearance, significant residual stenosis of the lumen was combined with balloon dilation and/or stent implantation. When the thrombus removal was not satisfactory, catheter-directed thrombolysis was performed. The incidence of postoperative complications, recurrence rate and recovery of the two groups were compared. There were no significant differences in postoperative recurrence (target vessel reconstruction rate), anklebrachial index and the incidence of postoperative complications between the two groups (P > 0.05); there were statistically significant differences in postoperative pain score and postoperative rehabilitation between the two groups (P < 0.05). The application of angiojet in the treatment of acute lower limb artery thromboembolism disease is safe and effective, minimally invasive, quicker recovery after operation, less postoperative complications, which is more suitable for the treatment of femoral popliteal arterial thromboembolism lesions. If the thrombus removal is not satisfactory, the combination of coronary artery aspiration catheter and catheterized directed thrombolysis can be used. Balloon dilation and stent implantation can be considered for obvious lumen stenosis."

    "title": "A Patient With Foot Pain Found to Have Leriche Syndrome: A Case Report and Brief Review of the Literature.",
    "abstract": "Leriche syndrome, a rare and critical complication of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), affects the distal abdominal aorta (infrarenal) and, similar to PAD, is a result of plaque buildup in the arterial lumen. The Leriche syndrome triad includes claudication in the proximal lower extremity, decreased or absent femoral pulses, and, in some cases, impotence. This article presents a patient with an atypical presentation of foot pain who was subsequently found to have Leriche syndrome. The patient was a 59-year-old female, a former smoker, who presented to the emergency department (ED) with atraumatic, acute right foot pain. All right lower extremity pulses were faintly audible on bedside Doppler. Computed tomography with angiography of the abdominal aorta revealed a Leriche-type occlusion of the infrarenal abdominal aorta and left common iliac and a 10 cm right popliteal arterial occlusion. Pharmacological anticoagulation was initiated by the ED. Definitive treatment in this patient included catheter-directed tissue plasminogen activator lysis to the thrombus on the right and placement of kissing stents in the distal aorta without complication. The patient made an excellent recovery and had a complete resolution of her symptoms. PAD is an omnipresent condition and, when untreated, can result in a myriad of high mortality and morbidity conditions such as Leriche syndrome. Collateral vessel formation can make the symptoms of Leriche syndrome vague and inconsistent, often making early recognition difficult. Optimal outcomes hinge on the clinician's ability to efficiently recognize, diagnose, stabilize, and coordinate multidisciplinary involvement of vascular and interventional radiology specialties. Case reports such as this one help to illuminate some of the more infrequent presentations of Leriche syndrome."

    "title": "Acute ischemia of the upper and lower limbs: Tailoring the treatment to the underlying etiology.",
    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia (ALI) can be a devastating clinical emergency with potentially limb- or life-threatening consequences. It is defined as a quickly developing or sudden decrease in limb perfusion producing new or worsening symptoms and signs, often threatening limb viability. ALI is commonly related to an acute arterial occlusion. Rarely, extensive venous occlusion can lead to upper and lower extremities ischemia (ie, phlegmasia). The incidence of acute peripheral arterial occlusion causing ALI is approximately 1.5 cases per 10,000 people per year. The clinical presentation depends on the etiology and whether the patient has underlying peripheral artery disease. Except for traumas, the most common etiologies are embolic or thrombotic events. Peripheral embolism, likely related to embolic heart disease, is the most common cause of acute upper extremity ischemia. However, an acute thrombotic event may occur in native arteries, at the site of a pre-existing atherosclerotic plaque, or as a failure of previous vascular interventions. The presence of an aneurysm may predispose to ALI for both embolic and thrombotic mechanisms. Immediate diagnosis, accurate assessment of limb viability, and prompt intervention, when needed, play important roles in salvaging the affected limb and preventing major amputation. Severity of symptoms is usually dependent on the amount of surrounding arterial collateralization, which may often reflect a pre-existing chronic vascular disease. For this reason, early recognition of the underlying etiology is crucial for choice of best management and definitely for treatment success. Any error in the initial evaluation may negatively affect the functional prognosis of the limb and endanger the patient's life. The aim of this article was to discuss diagnosis, etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of patients with acute ischemia of the upper and lower limbs."

    "abstract": "The thrombotic mechanism, being common to peripheral arterial disease (PAD), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and stroke, is responsible for the highest number of deaths in the western world. However, while much has been done for the prevention, early diagnosis, therapy of AMI and stroke, the same cannot be said for PAD, which is a negative prognostic indicator for cardiovascular death. Acute limb ischemia (ALI) and chronic limb ischemia (CLI) are the most severe manifestations of PAD. They both are defined by the presence of PAD, rest pain, gangrene, or ulceration and we consider ALI if symptoms last less than 2 weeks and CLI if they last more than 2 weeks. The most frequent causes are certainly atherosclerotic and embolic mechanisms and, to a lesser extent, traumatic or surgical mechanisms. From a pathophysiological point of view, atherosclerotic, thromboembolic, inflammatory mechanisms are implicated. ALI is a medical emergency that puts both limb and the patient's life at risk. In patients over age 80 undergoing surgery, mortality remains high reaching approximately 40% as well as amputation approximately 11%. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the scientific evidence on the possibilities of primary and secondary prevention of ALI and to raise awareness among doctors involved in the management of ALI, in particular by describing the central role of the general practitioner."

    "abstract": "Extra Corporeal Life Support (ECLS) is an evolving therapy in therapy-resistant cardiogenic shock (CS). Vascular cannulation in emergency situations can be accomplished through puncture of the femoral vessels by specialised teams. Since lower limb ischemia constitutes one of the major complications following cannulation, a distal perfusion cannula (DPC) has emerged as standard of care. We here aimed to analyse the impact of the DPC on limb perfusion and 6-month survival rate. In a retrospective study from January 2012 to December 2018, 98 patients with cardiogenic shock and peripheral (v-a) ECLS implantation with documented limb perfusion status were identified and analysed. Demographic data, laboratory parameters, cause of CS, comorbidities, limb perfusion complications and complication management were analysed. 53 patients (54%) received ECLS therapy in referral centers by our mobile ECLS team, while in 45 patients (46%) the cannulation occured in our center. 71 patients (72%) received a DPC (group A) at the time of ECLS implantation, whereas 27 (28%) (group B) did not or received later (14 patients owing to limb ischemia). 44 patients (45%) developed limb ischemia as a complication of ECLS therapy (31% in group A and 81% in group B- p < 0.001). The 6-month survival rate was 28% in our study cohort (30% in group A and 22% in group B- p = 0.469). Lower limb ischemia remains a serious complication after peripheral ECLS cannulation in CS, especially when a DPC is absent. Standardised DPC implementation may reduce the rate of severe limb complications in peripheral ECLS."

Upper extremity arterial thrombosis, when present, is more likely to occur on the ulnar side of the circulation. Severe ischemia resulting from radial artery thrombosis is rare, but iatrogenic cannulation is the most common etiology when it occurs. The risk factors underlying this dreadful presentation are numerous and still under investigation. Pregnancy and the immediate postpartum period are physiological hypercoagulable states. Here we present unusual cases of acute limb ischemia post iatrogenic cannulation in two patients within six weeks postpartum. At four weeks postpartum, a 26-year-old para-1 live-1 female presented to the emergency department with swelling in her right upper limb for four weeks and its blackish discoloration for one week. A 24-year-old primigravida female who had a termination of a blighted ovum 12 days ago presented to the emergency department with gangrenous changes in her right hand and forearm. Both patients reported recent antecubital fossa cannulation within six weeks postpartum, triggering gangrenous hand changes. Both patients had to undergo amputation of the digits and hand ultimately. Thus we postulate the need for extra care and education of healthcare workers in the cannulation of pregnant and post-pregnancy patients to prevent limb-threatening complications."

Due to her late presentation in the emergency department, we opted for a conservative approach, closely monitoring her renal function. We noticed a subsequent clinical and biochemical improvement over the following days, with the patient returning to her daily routine in a matter of weeks, despite a persisting bilateral foot drop. Since atypical antipsychotics are known to be associated with rhabdomyolysis, while possibly exerting a toxic effect on mitochondria, we hypothesize that a mild aerobic physical exertion might have triggered the event, in the context of an iatrogenic muscle susceptibility to oxidative distress."

However, TEVAR can be associated with complications such as endoleak, upper extremity limb ischemia, cerebrovascular ischemia, spinal cord ischemia, and post-implantation syndrome. An 80-year-old man with a history of complex thoracic aortic aneurysms underwent repair of a large thoracic aneurysm with a frozen elephant trunk procedure in 2019 at an outside institution. The proximal aortic graft extended to the arch and the innominate and left carotid artery were implanted into the distal portion of the graft. The endograft, extending from the proximal graft to the descending thoracic aorta, was fenestrated to maintain left subclavian artery flow. In an attempt to gain a seal at the fenestration, a Viabahn graft (Gore, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) was inserted. A type III endoleak was identified postoperatively at the fenestration, and a second Viabahn graft was required to gain a seal during the initial hospitalization. In 2020, an endoleak persisted at the fenestration on follow-up imaging, but the aneurysmal sac was stable. No intervention was recommended. The patient later presented to our institution with three days of chest pain. A type III endoleak at the level of the subclavian fenestration persisted with significant enlargement of the aneurysm sac. The patient underwent an urgent repair of the endoleak. This consisted of covering the fenestration with an endograft and left carotid to subclavian bypass. Subsequently, the patient developed a transient ischemic attack (TIA) due to kinking and extrinsic compression by the large aneurysm sac of the proximal left common carotid artery, requiring a right carotid to left carotid-axillary graft bypass. This report with a literature review discusses TEVAR complications and outlines methods to approach them. TEVAR complications and their management should be firmly understood to improve overall treatment outcomes."

An attempt of embolectomy didn't yield any clots. Urgent imaging with computed tomography angiogram of bilateral upper limbs revealed type A aortic dissection (TAAD).

    "abstract": "Acute arterial occlusion of the lower limbs is a medical and surgical emergency due to its morbi-mortality. We present the case of a 59-year-old man admitted to the emergency department for acute and diffuse pain in the left lower limb caused by extensive obstructive clots in the arteries of this limb. Since atheromatous cause was unlikely after angioscopy of the lower limbs, a cardiac origin was suspected. Echocardiogram was normal, however, thoracic angiotomography revealed a floating thrombus in the aortic arch. The patient was treated surgically with placement of an aortic endoprosthesis without complications. La oclusión arterial aguda de los miembros inferiores es una urgencia médica y quirúrgica por su morbimortalidad. Presentamos el caso de un hombre de 59 años que ingresó al servicio de urgencias por un dolor agudo y difuso del miembro inferior izquierdo causado por extensos coágulos obstructivos en las arterias del miembro inferior izquierdo. Siendo improbable la causa ateromatosa tras realización de la angioscopia de miembros inferiores, se sospechó un origen cardíaco. La ecografía cardiaca no mostró anomalías, sin embargo, la angiotomografía torácica reveló un trombo flotante en el arco aórtico. El paciente fue tratado quirúrgicamente con colocación de una endoprótesis aórtica sin complicaciones."

    "title": "The management of patients with popliteal artery aneurysms presenting with acute limb ischemia.",
    "abstract": "Endovascular popliteal artery aneurysm (PAA) repair has acceptable outcomes compared with open repair for elective therapy. Endovascular repair for urgent PAA causing acute limb ischemia (ALI) has not been well-studied. This project compares outcomes of urgent endovascular and open repair of PAA with ALI. The Vascular Quality Initiative database for peripheral vascular interventions (PVIs) and infrainguinal bypass were reviewed for PAAs with ALI from 2010 to 2021. Only patients entered as having symptoms of ALI in the PVI module and ALI as indication in the infrainguinal bypass module were included. In addition, patients undergoing elective treatment were excluded and the sample analyzed was restricted to patients undergoing urgent and emergent open and endovascular repair. Patient demographics and comorbidities as well as procedural details were compared between the two groups. Perioperative complications up to 30 days were compared as well as long-term outcomes including major amputation and mortality at 1 year. Urgent PAA repair for ALI constituted 10.5% (n = 571) of all PAAs. Most urgent repairs were open (80.6%; n = 460) with 19.4% (n = 111) endovascular. The proportion of endovascular repair significantly increased from 16.7% in 2010 to 85.7% in 2021. Patients undergoing endovascular repair were older (71.2 ± 12.5 vs 68.0 ± 11.8; P = .011) than patients undergoing open repair. They were also more likely to have coronary artery disease (32.4% vs 21.7%; P = .006). Open PAA repair was associated with more bleeding complications (20.8% vs 2.7%; P < .001), longer postoperative length of stay (8.1 ± 9.3 days vs 4.9 ± 5.6 days; P < .001), and less likelihood of discharge to home (64.9% vs 70.3%; P = .051). Perioperative major amputation rate was 7.5% with no difference between the two treatment strategies up to 1 year. However, patients receiving endovascular repair had higher inpatient (1.1% vs 0%; P < .001), 30-day (6.3% vs 0.4%; P < .001), and 1-year (16.5% vs 8.4%; P = .02) mortality. Multivariable regression analysis suggested that endovascular repair was possibly associated with increased 30-day mortality, but not 1-year mortality. Endovascular PAA has exponentially increased from 2010 to 2021. Endovascular repair is associated with decreased complications and hospital length of stay. The increased perioperative mortality seen in this group is likely due to selection bias."

    "abstract": "Left subclavian artery (LSA) revascularization during thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is necessary to reduce postoperative complications in patients with Stanford type B aortic dissection and an insufficient proximal anchoring area. However, the efficacy and safety of different LSA revascularization strategies remain unclear. Here, we compared these strategies to provide a clinical basis for selecting an appropriate LSA revascularization method. In this study, we included 105 patients with type B aortic dissection who were treated using TEVAR combined with LSA reconstruction in the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University from March 2013 to 2020. They were divided into four groups according to the method used for LSA reconstruction, namely, carotid subclavian bypass (CSB; n = 41), chimney graft (CG; n = 29), single-branched stent graft (SBSG; n = 21), and physician-made fenestration (PMF; n = 14) groups. Finally, we collected and analyzed the baseline, perioperative, operative, postoperative, and follow-up data of the patients. The treatment success rate was 100% in all the groups, and CSB + TEVAR was the most commonly used procedure in emergency settings compared with the other three procedures (P < 0.05). The estimated blood loss, contrast agent volume, fluoroscopic time, operation time, and limb ischemia symptoms during the follow-up were significantly different in the four groups (P < 0.05). Pairwise comparison among groups indicated that the estimated blood loss and operation time in the CSB group were the highest (adjusted P < 0.0083; P < 0.05). The contrast agent volume and fluoroscopy duration were the highest in the SBSG groups, followed by PMF, CG, and CSB groups. The incidence of limb ischemia symptoms was the highest in the PMF group (28.6%) during the follow-up. The incidence of complications (except limb ischemia symptoms) during the perioperative and follow-up periods was similar among the four groups (P > 0.05) The median follow-up time of CSB, CG, SBSG, and PMF groups was significantly different (P < 0.05), and the CSB group had the longest follow-up. Our single-center experience suggested that the PMF technique increased the risk of limb ischemia symptoms. The other three strategies effectively and safely restored LSA perfusion in patients with type B aortic dissection and had comparable complications. Overall, different LSA revascularization techniques have their advantages and disadvantages."

    "title": "[Clinical analysis of 11 cases of pregnancy with aortic dissection].",
    "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the treatment and maternal and fetal outcomes of pregnant women with aortic dissection (AD). Methods: The clinical data of 11 pregnant women with AD treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Air Force Military Medical University from January 1st, 2011 to August 1st, 2022 were collected, and their clinical characteristics, treatment plans and maternal and fetal outcomes were analyzed retrospectively. Results: (1) Clinical characteristics: the age of onset of 11 pregnant women with AD was (30±5) years old, and the week of pregnancy of onset was (31.4±8.0) weeks. Clinical manifestations: the main symptoms were sudden onset of chest and back pain or low back pain. Type of AD: 8 cases of Stanford type A, and 3 cases of type B. The aortic width was (42±11) mm. Diagnostic methods: the diagnosis of AD was confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), computed tomography angiography (CTA) or enhanced CT examination, among which 4 cases were confirmed by CTA examination, 4 cases by TTE examination, and 3 cases by enhanced CT examination. Laboratory results: white blood cell count was (15.4±8.7) ×109/L, neutrophil count was (13.5±8.5) ×109/L, the median D-dimer level was 2.7 mg/L (2.1-9.2 mg/L), and the median fibrin degradation products level was 12.0 mg/L (5.4-36.1 mg/L). (2) Treatments: all 11 patients were admitted to hospital in emergency. Before operation, the departments of cardiac surgery, obstetrics, pediatrics and anesthesiology cooperated to develop individualized treatment plan. Aortic surgery was performed in 11 pregnant women with AD. In 6 of them, pregnancy termination was performed at the same time as aortic surgery, and aortic surgery was performed after cesarean section. Four cases of pregnancy termination and aortic operation were performed by stages, including aortic operation after cesarean section in 2 cases, and cesarean section after aortic operation in 2 cases. One case (12+6 weeks of gestation) had spontaneous abortion on the day after aortic surgery. The gestational age of the 11 patients on pregnancy termination was (32.9±7.4) weeks. Aorta surgical methods: 7 patients received under extracorporeal circulation ascending aorta replacement ± aortic valve replacement ± coronary artery transplantation (or coronary artery bypass transplantation)± left and right coronary Cabrol + total arch replacement (or aortic arch replacement)± stent implantation, 1 patient received under extracorporeal circulation aortic root replacement, and 3 patients underwent aortic endoluminal isolation. (3) Maternal and fetal outcomes: among the 11 pregnant women with AD, 9 (9/11) survived, 2 (2/11) died with lower limb ischemia before the onset of the disease. A total of 10 newborns were born in 9 pregnant women after delivery (1 of them was twins), and the 2 cases were spontaneous abortion after aortic surgery in the first trimester (12+6 weeks) and fetal death after hysterotomy in the second trimester (26+3 weeks), respectively. Among the 10 surviving neonates, 3 were full-term infants and 7 were premature infants. The birth weight of newborn was (2 651±784) g. Respiratory distress syndrome was found in 6 cases. The newborns were followed up for (5.6±3.6) years after birth, and the infants developed well during the follow-up period. Conclusions: Pregnancy complicated with AD is dangerous, and chest and back pain is the main clinical manifestation of this disease. With early identification and selection of appropriate diagnostic methods, multidisciplinary diagnosis and treatment, mother and children could obtain good outcomes. 目的： 探讨妊娠合并主动脉夹层（AD）孕妇的治疗及母儿结局。 方法： 收集2011年1月1日至2022年8月1日空军军医大学第一附属医院收治的11例妊娠合并AD孕妇的临床资料及随访资料，回顾性分析其临床特点、治疗方案及母儿结局。 结果： （1）临床特点：11例妊娠合并AD孕妇的发病年龄为（30±5）岁，发病孕周为孕（31.4±8.0）周；临床表现：主要症状为突发胸背部疼痛或腰背部疼痛；AD分型：Stanford A型8例，B型3例；主动脉宽度为（42±11）mm。诊断方法：均通过经胸壁超声心动图（TTE）、计算机断层扫描血管造影（CTA）或增强CT检查明确AD的诊断，其中4例CTA检查、4例TTE检查、3例增强CT检查确诊。实验室检查结果：白细胞计数为（15.4±8.7）×109/L，中性粒细胞计数为（13.5±8.5）×109/L；中位D-二聚体水平为2.7 mg/L（2.1~9.2 mg/L），中位纤维蛋白降解产物水平为12.0 mg/L（5.4~36.1 mg/L）。（2）治疗：11例妊娠合并AD孕妇均急诊入院，术前心外科、产科、儿科、麻醉科协作制定个体化治疗方案。11例妊娠合并AD孕妇均行主动脉手术，其中6例终止妊娠与主动脉手术同期进行，且均先行剖宫产术再行主动脉手术；4例终止妊娠与主动脉手术分期进行，其中2例剖宫产术后行主动脉手术、2例主动脉手术后行剖宫产术；1例（孕12+6周）主动脉手术后当天自然流产。11例妊娠合并AD孕妇的终止妊娠孕周为孕（32.9±7.4）周。主动脉手术方式：7例行体外循环下升主动脉置换±主动脉瓣置换±冠状动脉移植（或冠状动脉旁路移植）±左右冠状动脉Cabrol分流+全弓置换（或主动脉弓置换）±支架置入术，1例行体外循环下主动脉根部置换术，3例行主动脉腔内隔绝术。（3）母儿结局：11例妊娠合并AD孕妇中，9例（9/11）孕妇存活，2例（2/11）死亡，死亡的2例孕妇发病前均有双下肢缺血表现；9例孕妇分娩后共获新生儿10例（其中1例为双胎），2例分别为孕早期（孕12+6周）主动脉手术后自然流产、孕中期（孕26+3周）剖宫取胎术后胎儿死亡。10例新生儿中，3例为足月儿，7例为早产儿；新生儿出生体重为（2 651±784）g；其中6例出现呼吸窘迫综合征。新生儿出生后随访（5.6±3.6）年，随访期内婴幼儿发育良好。 结论： 妊娠合并AD发病凶险，胸背部疼痛为其主要临床表现，尽早识别并选择合适的诊断方法，多学科协作诊治，母儿可获得良好结局。."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous lower extremity arterial dissection has been linked to atherosclerotic and non-atherosclerotic causes. A 55-year-old male presented to the emergency department via emergency medical services for a chief complaint of right leg pain. He stated that he was performing leg exercises when he felt a sudden pop in his right leg followed by severe pain. His exam was remarkable for lack of ipsilateral distal popliteal or dorsalis pedis pulse by palpation or doppler. The patient was admitted to a three-year history of non-prescription testosterone injection use along with a history of prior portal vein thrombosis two years prior with anticoagulation noncompliance after one month of therapy. A computed tomography angiography of the lower extremity was performed which demonstrated complete acute occlusion of the right common iliac, and right external iliac, along with right femoral artery dissection. The patient was emergently taken to the operating room with vascular surgery where a thrombectomy with stent placement was performed. After three days in the surgical intensive care unit and nine days in the hospital, the patient was subsequently discharged from the hospital in good condition. A post-operative follow-up appointment three weeks after discharge revealed mild residual pain; however, no issues ambulating or residual weakness, and normal ankle-brachial indexes. This case highlights a unique presentation of acute limb ischemia associated with exogenous testosterone use."

Using a near-infrared spectroscopy oximeter, regional tissue oxygen saturation (rSO2) was monitored to assess the tissue perfusion pre-, intra-, and postoperatively. rSO2 values did not increase sufficiently following thromboembolectomy of the superficial femoral artery, but they dramatically recovered after additional popliteal-anterior tibial bypass surgery. The affected limb was successfully salvaged. rSO2 monitoring was easily measured intraoperatively, which might be beneficial in evaluating tissue perfusion in patients with acute limb ischemia."

The most severe complication is phlegmasia cerulea dolens (PCD), a medical emergency that requires quick intervention to prevent irreversible limb ischemia. This article reports the case of a patient with PCD as the first manifestation of IVCS. The treatment included embolectomy and fasciotomy. Bilateral femoral iliac axis phlebography and cavography were performed 48 hours after the procedure. The IVCS was identified, and balloon predilatation of the lesions followed by implantation of self-expanding stents from the confluence of the LCIV with the inferior vena cava to the middle portion of the left external iliac vein was performed. Postprocedure phlebography demonstrated satisfactory final results, and a 12-month follow-up image showed patent stents and minimal intimal hyperplasia."

    "abstract": "Whipple's disease is known to cause multiple varied systemic symptoms, and is a well-documented cause of culture-negative endocarditis. Endocarditis secondary to Whipple disease, however, has rarely been known to present primarily as a cause of acute limb ischemia. We describe such a case here. A previously healthy 40 year old man presented to the emergency department with acute-onset right arm paresthesias. On exam, he was found to be tachycardic with a VI/VI systolic ejection murmur. He was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia and severe aortic regurgitation, and echocardiography showed a large mass on his bicuspid aortic valve. Thrombectomy was performed urgently, with aortic valve repair the following day. As blood cultures and valvular tissue culture remained unrevealing, the patient remained on empiric vancomycin and ceftriaxone for culture-negative endocarditis. 16 s rRNA nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) of his formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded valvular tissue detected T. whipplei, after which the patient was transitioned to ceftriaxone and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a year of therapy. He continues to do clinically well. We report an unusual presentation of Whipple endocarditis as an acute upper limb ischemia, absent other classic symptoms of Whipple's disease, and with diagnosis made by 16 s rRNA NAAT of valvular tissue in the setting of culture-negative endocarditis."

    "abstract": "Thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) of the aortic arch has started to spread in recent years. We present our initial experience with TEVAR involving supra-aortic branches using parallel and branched grafts. Parallel grafts are typically used in emergency cases. In the case of Z0 proximal fixation, we can perform a combined hybrid surgery with Z1 debranching and securing of the innominate artery with chimney graft, which can also be used instead of Z0 debranching when the patient is unfit for sternotomy. In the case of TEVAR with planned Z2 position with inadvertent covering of the left common carotid artery, we can perform chimney conversion to rapidly recover the circulation of the left common carotid artery (LCCA). Instead of prior revascularization of the left subclavian artery, chimney graft can be used to recover the lumen, in the case of left upper limb ischemia after Z2 TEVAR. Exclusion of penetrating aortic ulcers located in the lesser curvature can be facilitated by use of a custom-made graft, where a scallop is placed around the origin of the supra-aortic vessel, thus increasing the length of the proximal neck. For elective interventions, custom-made branching grafts can be allowed to save all three branches with Z0 fixation. Technical success was obtained in all cases. Orv Hetil. 2023; 164(11): 426-431. Az aortaívet érintő aortabetegségek miatt végzett endovascularis rekonstrukciók (thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair – TEVAR) során a sztentgraft proximalis rögzítése az ívben vagy az aorta ascendensen van. Ilyen esetben hagyományosan nyitott műtéttel előzetesen biztosítjuk a lefedésre kerülő supraaorticus ágak keringését (ún. ’debranching’ műtétek). Nyitott műtétre nem alkalmas betegek esetén azonban az ágak endovascularis módszerekkel történő megtartására kényszerülünk. Tanulmányunkban ezen komplex endovascularis aortaív-rekonstrukciók lehetőségeit mutatjuk be. A párhuzamos graftokat jellemzően sürgősségi körülmények között alkalmazzuk. Az ascendensen történő proximalis rögzítés esetén a jobb arteria (a.) carotisról indított ’debranching’ és a truncus brachiocephalicus párhuzamos grafttal történő biztosításával kombinált hibrid műtétet végeztünk. Létfontosságú ér véletlen lefedésével járó TEVAR esetén sürgősséggel végezhetünk konverziót például a bal a. carotis communis keringésének gyors helyreállítására. A bal a. subclavia előzetes revascularisatiója nélkül végzett sürgősségi TEVAR után ritkán jelentkező bal felső végtagi ischaemia esetén utólagos konverziót végezhetünk a bal a. subclavia lumenének helyreállítására ugyancsak párhuzamos grafttal. A kisgörbületen elhelyezkedő, saccularis morfológiájú penetráló aortafekélyek sikeres kirekesztését segítheti egyedi gyártású graft alkalmazása, melyen a nagygörbületen lévő supraaorticus érszájadék köré kivágást, ún. ’scallop’-ot helyezünk a graft proximalis végéhez, megnövelve így a proximalis nyak hosszát. Elektív körülmények között ugyancsak egyedileg gyártott elágazó graftot is alkalmazhatunk, melynek során akár mindhárom ág megtartható az ascendensről induló proximalis rögzítés mellett, így arra alkalmas anatómia esetén endovascularis ívcserére is lehetőségünk van.

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia is a vascular emergency and current guidelines emphasize the need for rapid treatment in a vascular center with an option of open surgical and interventional revascularization. Endovascular revascularization options for acute limb ischemia are increasingly focused on a wide range of mechanical thrombectomy devices based on different operating principles.For patients with acute limb ischemia in the setting of covid-19 infection high mortality rates and low technical success rates of revascularization procedures have been described. Rezente Studien zeigen bei Patienten mit peripherer arterieller Verschlusskrankheit eine Inzidenz der akuten Extremitätenischämie von 0,8 pro 100 Patientenjahre. Aktuelle Leitlinien betonen die Notwendigkeit einer raschen Behandlung im Gefäßzentrum mit einer Option der offen-chirurgischen und interventionellen Revaskularisierung unter situativer Anpassung der Strategie. Im Vergleich zur offenen Operation zeigte sich in einer schwedischen Analyse mit Propensity score Matching ein Benefit für ein endovaskuläres Vorgehen bei ALI im Hinblick auf die Sterblichkeitsrate nach 30 Tagen und einem Jahr. Ähnliche Ergebnisse wurden in einer US-Analyse gezeigt, da hier die Sterblichkeitsrate während des stationären Aufenthalts bei endovaskulär behandelten Patienten ebenfalls geringer war. In manchen Fällen kann eine Kombination aus offenen und endovaskulären Techniken im Sinne eines Hybrideingriffes erforderlich sein. ENDOVASKULäRE PERKUTANE INTERVENTIONSOPTIONEN BEI ALI.: Die endovaskulären Revaskularisierungsoptionen bei akuter Extremitätenischämie konzentrieren sich zunehmend auf ein breites Spektrum mechanischer Thrombektomiegeräte, basierend auf unterschiedlichen Funktionsprinzipien. Als Vorteil können mit manchen Systemen auch organisierte, subakute Thromben entfernt werden, die durch eine Lysetherapie häufig nicht ausreichend behandelt werden können. Eine lokale Thrombolyse kann so oft eingespart werden oder ist nur für kurze Zeit erforderlich, was das Blutungsrisiko deutlich reduziert. AKUTE EXTREMITäTENISCHäMIE UND COVID-19.: Die bei Patienten mit COVID-19-Erkrankung gehäuft beobachteten Gerinnungsstörungen und damit verbundenen thrombotischen Komplikationen spielen auch eine Rolle für das Auftreten einer akuten Extremitätenischämie bei COVID-19. Zwar zeigen die meisten betroffenen Patienten typische Risikofaktoren für ALI, aber auch bislang weitgehend gesunde Patienten ohne typische Risikofaktoren oder Vorerkrankungen können betroffen sein. Vergleichende Analysen zeigen hohe Sterblichkeits- und niedrige technische Erfolgsraten bei Revaskularisation."

Timely management and recognition of this rare presentation are crucial as this condition can result in limb loss or death if not treated in a timely manner. An 80-year-old man with history of hypertension presented to the emergency department complaining of inability to feel sensation below his left knee after falling from ground level. Physical examination was pertinent for bounding radial and femoral pulses bilaterally, although absent dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses to the left lower extremity. Computed tomography angiography identified occlusion of the left superficial femoral arterial lumen associated with a ruptured popliteal aneurysm, approximately eight centimeters in size. He immediately received unfractionated heparin and was admitted to the hospital for left medial thigh exploration and decompressive dermatofasciotomy. After confirmation of popliteal aneurysmal rupture with advanced imaging, heparinization and vascular surgery consultation are critical steps that should be taken to prevent limb loss."

    "abstract": "Acute tumour embolism to the popliteal artery resulting in limb-threatening ischemia is a rare complication of neoplastic disease. Generally, tumors embolize to the pulmonary circulation via the venous system. In this case, the originating tumor was a lung cancer of a large size and advanced stage that had invaded the left atrium of the heart and disseminated in the systemic circulation. The tumor likely fragmented, resulting in showering to the right popliteal artery, superior mesenteric artery, and left renal artery, which is a unique presentation of tumor embolism. We present a case of a 62-year-old Caucasian gentleman with a large left lower lobe squamous cell lung cancer that had invaded into the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. He presented with acute limb threatening ischemia. A computed tomographic angiogram revealed an occlusion of the left popliteal artery as well as embolization to the superior mesenteric artery and the right renal artery. He was started on intravenous heparin and underwent an emergency popliteal embolectomy and calf fasciotomies, which was limb saving. His fasciotomy wounds were closed after 1 week and he was discharged on anticoagulation. This is a rare case of tumor embolism resulting in both an embolectomy and calf fasciotomies. In the light of such cases, we suggest that tumors invading the bloodstream should be considered high risk for embolization and hypothesize that prophylactic antithrombotic therapy may avoid major morbidity."

In the era of heightened interest in the length of stay (LOS) for surgical patients, this study aims to investigate the association of obesity with postoperative outcomes at the patient, hospital, and at surgeon levels. This study used the Society of Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative suprainguinal bypass database from 2003 to 2021. The selected study cohort was divided into obese patients (body mass index ≥30) (group I) and nonobese patients (body mass index <30) (group II). Primary outcomes of the study included mortality, operative time, and postoperative LOS. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to study the outcomes of ABF bypass in group I. Operative time and postoperative LOS were transformed into binary values by median split for regression analysis. A P value of .05 or less was deemed statistically significant in all the analyses of this study. The study cohort consisted of 5392 patients. In this population, 1093 were obese (group I) and 4299 were nonobese (group II). Group I was found to have more females with higher rates of comorbid conditions, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and congestive heart failure. Patients in group I had increased odds of prolonged operative time (≥250 minutes) and an increased LOS (≥6 days). Patients in this group also had a higher chance of intraoperative blood loss, prolonged intubation, and required vasopressors postoperatively. There was also an increased odds of postoperative decline in renal function in the obese population. Patients with prior history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and urgent or emergent procedures were found to be risk factors for a LOS of more than 6 days in obese patients. An increase in the surgeons' case volume was associated with lesser odds of an operative time of 250 minutes or more; however, no significant impact was found on postoperative LOS. Hospitals where 25% or more of ABF bypasses were performed on obese patients were also more likely to have LOS of less than 6 days after ABF operations, compared with hospitals where less than 25% of ABF bypasses were performed on obese patients. Patients undergoing ABF for chronic limb-threatening ischemia or acute limb ischemia had a longer LOS and increased operative times. ABF bypass in obese patients is associated with prolonged operative times and a longer LOS than in nonobese patients. Obese patients operated by surgeons with more cases of ABF bypasses have shorter operative times. A hospital's increasing proportion of obese patients was related to a decreased LOS. These findings support the known volume-outcome relationship that, with a higher surgeon case volume and increased proportion of obese patients in a hospital, there is an improvement in outcomes of obese patients undergoing ABF bypass."

The aim of this study was to present an updated overview of characteristics, diagnosis, and current treating strategies of patients with ALI."

    "abstract": "Vasopressors used in critically ill patients with refractory shock poses a serious risk of non-occlusive peripheral limb ischemia leading to tissue necrosis and amputation. Acute limb ischemia is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Evidence-based medical literature is scarce on the prevention and management of vasopressor-induced acute limb ischemia (VIALI). Despite being a well-known and frequent complication of vasopressors, there is no standardized guideline for the prevention and management of vasopressor-induced limb ischemia. Vasopressors are required for the management of refractory shock which is defined as hypotension not responsive to intravenous fluid resuscitation alone. Distributive shock, which includes septic shock, causes inadequate tissue perfusion in adjunct with vasopressor use and is the most common cause of non-occlusive peripheral limb ischemia. This case study will focus on how early recognition and prompt treatment of VIALI are crucial in minimizing tissue necrosis and preventing amputations. We present a case of a middle-aged woman who developed distributive shock from sepsis of a urinary source secondary to obstructive uropathy (ureteral calculi). She presented with refractory shock and continued to remain in shock while undergoing emergent rigid cystoscopy with the placement of a ureteral stent. Despite adequate volume resuscitation, she required high doses of vasopressors resulting in peripheral extremity ischemia and necrosis of all her fingers and toes. By promptly initiating mitigation and preventive management strategies, we succeeded in minimizing tissue ischemia and reducing morbidity resulting from iatrogenic vasopressor-induced peripheral non-occlusive ischemia. These strategies include but are not limited to external warming of bilateral lower extremities, nitroglycerin paste application over the entire extremity, arterial assist pump, and low-dose therapeutic anticoagulation. The novel use of the arterial pump in acutely ischemic lower extremities likely helped salvage the toes which appeared to be at high risk of amputation."

    "abstract": "Large bore arterial hemostasis for emergent MCS initiation in cardiogenic shock and during failures of suture mediated vascular closure devices (VCD) necessitates dry/post-closure technique for successful closure. Use of the alternative MANTA fluoroscopic DOT technique, without depth finder, as post closure and as 'bail-out' in this high-risk patient population is described. All patients who underwent emergent percutaneous transfemoral MCS initiation, without use of upfront sutured-mediated pro-glide VCDs, and procedures where proglide-perclose technique (PPT) failed to achieve hemostasis were post-closed with the alternative MANTA fluoroscopic DOT technique (without depth finder) as primary method or as 'bail-out'. Patient related factors, cardiovascular co-morbidities, clinical indication, distribution of 14F versus 18F MANTA, and types of procedures obtained. Primary outcomes of access site related acute flow-limiting limb ischemia or bleeding requiring intervention analyzed. 27 patients met inclusion criteria; mean age 64 years, majority male 19 (70 %), more than half obese (56 %) with mean BMI 31.06 kg/m2. 22 (81 %) had emergent MCS initiation and 5 (19 %) PPT hemostasis failures. Types of percutaneous MCS support included; 11 (44 %) Impella CP, 2 (7 %) 15F arterial ECMO, 6 (22 %) 17F arterial ECMO, 4 (15 %) 19F ECMO. All achieved hemostasis utilizing alternative MANTA fluoroscopic DOT technique without vascular complications of bleeding or acute ischemic limb. The alternative MANTA fluoroscopic DOT technique (without depth finder) can be successfully applied as post-closure for emergent MCS support delayed hemostasis and as bail-out for per-close suture mediated VCD failures for large bore arterial hemostasis."

    "abstract": "Acute lower extremity ischemia is one of the most common emergencies in vascular surgery and is a cause of considerable morbidity and mortality. The goal of this study was to evaluate outcomes of revascularization for acute lower extremity ischemia and to determine factors associated with perioperative morbidity and mortality. A total of 354 patients underwent urgent revascularization for acute lower extremity ischemia at an academic medical center between 2014 and 2019. A retrospective review of patients' demographics, comorbidities, etiology and severity of limb ischemia, and procedural characteristics was recorded. Outcomes, including postoperative complications, perioperative limb loss, and mortality, were analyzed. The mean patient age was 69 ± 17 years, and 52% were females. 50% of patients presented with Rutherford Class IIb ischemia. Arterial embolization was the most common cause of limb ischemia, seen in 33% of cases. Open surgical revascularization was performed in 241 (68%) patients, while endovascular and hybrid approaches were utilized in 53 (15%) and 60 (17%) cases, respectively. Postoperative adverse events occurred in 44% of patients, including wound complications (11%), cardiac (5%) and pulmonary (16%) complications, strokes (4%), UTIs (10%), renal failure (14%), bleeding (5%), and compartment syndrome (3%). The rate of unplanned return to the operating room was 21%. Major adverse cardiovascular events were seen in 103 (29%) patients and major adverse limb events were seen in 57 (16%) patients. The median length of stay was 10 days (IQR = 4); 49% patients were discharged to skilled nursing facility and 19% were readmitted within 30 days.The rate of amputation during index admission was 10%, and perioperative mortality was 20%. Gender, tibial runoff, and etiology of limb ischemia were independent predictors of limb loss. Women had lower risk of limb loss than men (OR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.023, 0.38). Poor tibial runoff (one-vessel or absence of flow below the knee) was a significant predictor of limb loss as compared to three-vessel runoff (OR, 14.92; 95% CI, 1.92, 115.88). Aneurysmal disease (OR, 38.35; 95% CI, 3.54, 42.45) and traumatic injuries (OR, 108.08; 95% CI, 8.21, 159.06) were the strongest predictors of amputation as compared to other etiologies of limb ischemia. Multivariate model identified ESRD (OR, 9.2; 95% CI, 1.8-46.3), degree of ischemia (class IIb or higher vs class IIa; OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.2-10.6), and age (OR, 1.5; 95% CI 1.1-2.0 for every 10 years) as independent predictors of perioperative mortality. Urgent revascularization for management of acute limb ischemia is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Elderly patients with ESRD presenting with severely threatened limbs have especially high risk of perioperative mortality and may not be ideal candidates for limb salvage."

    "abstract": "Acute limb embolism (ALE) is a challenging, highly morbid, and frequently fatal vascular emergency. Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (PMT) devices are an alternative treatment to restore perfusion by removing emboli in the limb arterial system. We evaluated the outcomes of treatment of ALE patients using PMT devices in our center. A retrospective review of ALE patients treated with Rotarex S (Straub Medical) at a single institution from 2018 to 2022 was performed. The primary outcome was technical success, defined as complete recanalization of the occluded segment with satisfactory outflow and good capillary filling of the distal parts of the foot without any major or obstructing residual emboli or thrombi either in the treated segment or in the outflow tract without the need for additional catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) or conversion to open surgery. Embolized segments treated, treatment outcomes, and perioperative complications were reviewed. A total of 17 ALE patients (29% men, 71% women; mean age, 73 years) underwent PMT procedures. The femoral arteries and popliteal arteries are the most commonly treated vessels, with both present in 59% of the patients. The technical success rate was 100%, but the majority of cases (82%) had concurrent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or stent grafting, and two patients were treated with urokinase during the operation. There was one thrombotic recurrence that required amputation. There were no 30-day deaths. Complications included extravasation after PMT (two), intraoperative embolization of the outflow tract (one), access site hematoma (one), target artery thrombosis (one), and acute kidney injury (one). There were no severe bleeding complications. The Rotarex S device has a satisfactory success rate, although complementary use of various adjunctive techniques is frequently required. It seems to be a moderately effective tool for treating ALE to avoid CDT or open surgery. The device appears safe, with low risks of amputation and mortality rates, but special attention should be given to the potential for extravasation and distal embolism."

    "abstract": "Critical ischemia of the lower limbs refers to the last stages of peripheral arterial disease. It is characterized by resting discomfort or trophic disorders such as ulceration, skin necrosis, or gangrene in the lower limbs. Critical ischemia corresponds to Leriche-Fontaine (LF) stages III-IV and Rutherford stages 4-6. The purpose of this study was to observe the patency and postoperative complications of patients who have had infra-inguinal surgical revascularization and compare the results based on the kind of graft utilized. The present study was designed as an observational retrospective cohort study, including all patients from 2018 to 2019 diagnosed with severe ischemia of the lower limbs who were hospitalized at the Vascular Surgery Clinic of the County Emergency Clinical Hospital of Targu Mures. Patients with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft had a higher incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p = 0.01), stage III LF (70.41% vs. 55.29%), p = 0.03), and a lower incidence of stage IV LF (29.95% vs. 44.71%, p = 0.03). As for complications, the PTFE group showed a lower incidence of bypass thrombosis (29.59% vs. 44.71%; p = 0.03) and graft infection (9.18% vs. 21.18%; p = 0.02), but no statistical significance in the event of bleeding (p = 0.40). Regarding the outcomes, no statistical significance was seen for below-the-knee amputations or death. However, the PTFE group had a lower incidence of above-the-knee amputations (11.22% vs. 24.71%; p = 0.01). At multivariate analysis, the PTFE graft is an independent predictor of primary patency at 6, 12, and 24 months (OR: 2.15, p = 0.02; OR: 1.84, p = 0.04; and OR: 1.89, p = 0.03), as well as a protective factor against bypass thrombosis (OR: 0.52; p = 0.03), graft infection (OR: 0.37; p = 0.02), and above-the-knee amputation (OR: 0.38; p = 0.01).; Conclusions: According to this study's findings, there were minor differences regarding the long-term patency, bypass thrombosis, graft infections, and above-the-knee amputations. In addition, the PTFE graft group had a higher incidence of primary patency at 6, 12, and 24 months, as well as a lower incidence of bypass thrombosis, graft infection, and above-the-knee amputations."

This will add to the existing body of literature by highlighting the possible complications associated with the use of ProGlide and reiterate that the use of the sono-guided ProGlide skill will reduce the incidence of these complications. A 78-year-old man underwent minimally invasive cardiac surgery for severe aortic valve stenosis. After the operation, the puncture site of the common femoral artery was closed using ProGlide. The next morning, after regaining consciousness, he complained of pain, motor weakness (grade 2), and coldness in the right lower extremity. A 65-year-old man underwent minimally invasive cardiac surgery for a large secundum atrial septal defect (5 cm × 5 cm). After the operation, the puncture site of the common femoral artery was closed using ProGlide. After extubation, the patient complained of paresthesia of the right thigh. Both the patients underwent emergency surgery for acute occlusion of the common femoral artery. If the sono-guided ProGlide skill is used, complications can be prevented, and ProGlide can be safely used."

    "abstract": "Aberrant subclavian arteries (aSCAs), with or without aortic pathology, are uncommon. The purpose of the present study was to review our experience with the surgical management of aSCA. We performed a retrospective review of patients who had undergone surgery for an aSCA between 1996 and 2020. Symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were included. The primary end points were ≤30-day and late mortality. The secondary end points were ≤30-day complications, graft patency, and reinterventions. A total of 46 symptomatic and 3 asymptomatic patients with aSCA had undergone surgery (31 females [62%]; median age, 45 years). An aberrant right subclavian artery was present in 38 (78%) and an aberrant left subclavian artery in 11 patients (22%). Of the 49 patients, 41 (84%) had had a Kommerell diverticulum (KD) and 11 (22%) had had a concomitant distal arch or proximal descending thoracic aortic aneurysm. Symptoms included dysphagia (56%), dyspnea (27%), odynophagia (20%), and upper extremity exertional fatigue (16%). Five patients (10%) had required emergency surgery. The aSCA had been treated by transposition in 32, a carotid to subclavian bypass in 11, and an ascending aorta to subclavian bypass in 6. The KD was treated by resection and oversewing in 19 patients (39%). Fifteen patients (31%) had required distal arch or proximal descending thoracic aortic replacement for concomitant aortic disease and/or KD treatment. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair was used to exclude the KD in six patients (12%). Seven patients (14%) had undergone only bypass or transposition. The 30-day complications included one death from pulseless electrical activity arrest secondary to massive pulmonary embolism. The 30-day major complications (14%) included acute respiratory failure in three, early mortality in one, stroke in one, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction in one, and temporary dialysis in one patient. The other complications included chylothorax/lymphocele (n = 5; 10%), acute kidney injury (n = 2; 4%), pneumonia (n = 2; 4%), wound infection (n = 2; 4%), atrial fibrillation (n = 2; 4%), Horner syndrome (n = 2; 4%), lower extremity acute limb ischemia (n = 1; 2%), and left recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (n = 1; 2%). At a median follow-up of 53 months (range, 1-230 months), 40 patients (82%) had had complete symptom relief and 9 (18%) had experienced improvement. Six patients had died at a median of 157 months; the deaths were not procedure or aortic related. The primary patency was 98%. Reintervention at ≤30 days had been required for two patients (4%) for ligation of lymphatic vessels and bilateral lower extremity fasciotomy after proximal descending thoracic aorta replacement. One patient had required late explantation of an infected and occluded carotid to subclavian bypass graft, which was treated by cryopreserved allograft replacement. Surgical treatment of the aSCA can be accomplished with low major morbidity and mortality with excellent primary patency and symptom relief."

    "abstract": "The purpose of the study was to compare the clinical presentation, management, and outcomes of surgical revascularization for acute limb ischemia (ALI) in 2 groups of patients-with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the 2 years (01.01.2020-31.12.2021) all consecutive patients diagnosed with ALI and treated with urgent revascularization were prospectively enrolled. Based on the results of polymerase chain reaction swab for SARS-CoV-2 infection patients were allocated to group A-infected or group B-noninfected. Demographic characteristics, clinical, imaging, laboratory data, and details of treatment were collected prospectively. The composite endpoint of major amputation and/or death at 30 days after surgery was defined as main study outcome. The postoperative ankle-brachial index value, reinterventions, complications, and length of hospital stay were considered as secondary outcomes. Overall, 130 patients (139 limbs with ALI) were analyzed-21 patients (23 limbs) in group A and 109 patients (116 limbs) in group B. The anatomical site of arterial occlusion, duration, and severity of ischemia did not differ significantly between the groups. Patients with COVID-19 had significantly shorter time from ALI onset till administration of the first dose of anticoagulant: 8 (2.5-24) hr vs. 15.7 (6-72) hr in group B, P = 0.02. Vascular imaging was performed before intervention only in 5 (23.8%) infected patients compared to 78 (71.5%) patients in group B, P < 0.001. The main outcome was registered in 38 (29.2%) patients, significantly more frequent in infected cohort: 12 (57.1%) patients in group A versus 26 (23.8%) in group B, P = 0.003. Difference was preponderantly caused by high mortality in group A-9 (42.8%) patients, compared to 17 (15.5%) patients in group B, P = 0.01. The difference in the rate of limb loss was not statistically significant: 4 (17.3%) limbs were amputated in COVID-19 patients and 12 (10.3%) limbs-in noninfected patients (P = 0.3). Combination of ALI and COVID-19 resulted in increased 30-day mortality-risk ratio (RR) 2.7 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.42-5.31), P = 0.002, but did not lead to significantly higher amputation rate-RR 1.6 (95% CI: 0.59-4.75), P = 0.32. In group A initial admission of the patient in the intensive care unit was an independent risk factor for amputation/death. Excepting systemic complications which were more frequently registered among COVID-19 patients: 7 (33%) cases vs. 14 (12.8%) in group B, P = 0.04; no differences in other secondary outcomes were observed between the groups. Study demonstrates the significant negative impact of COVID-19 upon the 30-day amputation-free survival in patients undergoing urgent surgical revascularization for ALI. The difference in outcome is influenced by higher rate of mortality among infected patients, rather than by the rate of limb loss. Severity of COVID-19, namely requirement of intensive care, mostly determines the outcome of ALI treatment."

Beyond this debate, there is a lack of data about left subclavian artery coverage during TEVAR in end-stage renal disease patients with a functional left upper limb atreriovenous fistula. We present the case of a patient with a left distal radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula who underwent emergent TEVAR with left subclavian artery coverage for ruptured type B aortic dissection. The arteriovenous fistula remains functional on a 3-month follow-up, and the patient did not develop symptoms related to posterior stroke, spinal cord ischemia, limb ischemia, or vertebrobasilar insufficiency."

    "abstract": "Adventitial Cystic Disease (ACD) is a vastly rare non-atherosclerotic vascular pathology that is principally manifested as intermittent claudication because of peripheral vascular ischemia. Precise etiological factors are not yet concretely identified, and it represents 0.1 % of all lower limb claudication causes. Middle-aged males are the most affected gender age group. Misdiagnosis of Popliteal Artery ACD could delay proper management and hence risk the loss of the affected limb due to critical limb ischemia. We hereby explore the rare case of a 51-year-old female patient, who complained of vague left lower extremity pain accompanied by paresthesia for 1 month prior to admission without signs of local inflammation. The preoperative radiological assessment suggested the presence of thrombosis within the left Popliteal Artery which caused an occlusion in it and hence the proper blood flow was compromised. Surgical intervention and the complete removal of the lesion along with establishing a patent synthetic anastomotic graft to maintain the preexisting vascular bundle was the key to treating our patient. Microscopic analysis of the excised specimen revealed an Adventitial Cystic Disease of the Popliteal Artery. Adventitial Cystic Disease represents an extremely rare vascular pathology with a vast margin of non-specific symptoms that could lead to misdiagnoses. It is fundamental to establish suitable preoperative screening protocols for it and sustain adequate levels of clinical awareness so that we can timely diagnose and in turn, achieve proper therapeutic interventions to plummet the potential disastrous complications that could ensue."

Our study was designed and developed based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Guideline. We critically assessed all included articles by Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklists and the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS). A total of 29 articles (1338 patients/1387 limbs) were included in the study. After a 1-year follow-up, the primary patency rate of the open surgery group was significantly lower than that of the endovascular intervention group (72.65 vs. 81.46%, P = 0.004), but without significant difference in the secondary patency rate (86.19 vs. 86.86%, P = 0.825). The limb salvage rate of the open surgery group was also significantly lower (83.07 vs. 98.25%, P < 0.001).

    "abstract": "Acute lower limb ischemia (ALI) is a limb- and potentially life-threatening condition which requires urgent evaluation and treatment. Contemporary data on optimal therapy and prognosis of ALI are lacking, while surgical, hybrid, and foremost endovascular techniques have rapidly evolved over the past decades. Available clinical guidelines are not based on high-level evidence and do not fully reflect day-do-day practice. Contemporary data on etiology, procedural strategies as well as patient outcomes in ALI are urgently needed to improve care and prevent limb loss. The current study was initiated by the European Vascular Research Collaborative (EVRC), established by young European vascular specialists, and aims to provide insight into contemporary treatment strategies in ALI and its clinical results within Europe. In this manuscript we report the rationale and a detailed study protocol. The proposed study is a prospective, international, multicenter, observational study on ALI (PROMOTE-ALI) (ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT05138679). Patients with ALI (Rutherford classification grade I -III) of one or both lower extremities will be included in the study. The primary endpoint of the study is amputation-free survival (AFS) at 30 d. Secondary endpoints are freedom from target limb reintervention, freedom from complications, clinical outcome of the index leg, and limb salvage and survival at 30 and 90 d after diagnosis of ALI. ALI remains a challenging condition and due to the heterogeneous etiology, clinical presentation and treatment strategies, a large multicenter study on this topic is needed to gain contemporary data on clinical outcomes and prognosis, especially for modern endovascular techniques. PROMOTE-ALI is expected to provide these data and set a benchmark for future randomized controlled trials (RCTs)."

    "abstract": "Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia is a rarely encountered B-lymphocytic malignancy. Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia-associated paraproteinaemia is linked to an increase in serum viscosity, which results in a hypercoagulable state. Burning bilateral foot pain in a man with alcohol dependence and controlled atrial fibrillation presenting to the emergency department was attributed to peripheral neuropathy, given satisfactory angiographic evidence of bilateral foot arterial blood supply. Subsequently, his presentation as an emergency with acute bilateral critical lower limb ischemia that was managed by bilateral above-knee amputations, prompted a wider search for other etiologies. We present a hitherto unreported case of Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia-related acute bilateral lower limb ischemia, which required bilateral above-knee amputations. A 50-year-old Caucasian man, who was an alcohol dependent heavy smoker, presented with burning pain in his right foot that was deemed to be related to alcoholic neuropathy. A computerized tomographic angiogram demonstrated an occluded right distal anterior tibial artery but a patent posterior tibial artery supplying the foot arch, findings that were associated with noncritical ischemia. After multiple presentations within a week, he was admitted following sudden clinical deterioration with acute confusion, hyponatremia, and bilateral foot pain. Over the course of 24 hours, the patient deteriorated rapidly, with bilateral lower limb ischemia requiring bilateral above-knee amputations. Subsequent investigations revealed a diagnosis of Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only reported case of Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia-induced bilateral lower limb ischemia requiring major bilateral amputations."

    "abstract": "Background: Numerous tools, including inflammatory biomarkers and lung injury severity scores, have been evaluated as predictors of thromboembolic events and the requirement for intensive therapy in COVID-19 patients. This study aims to verify the predictive role of inflammatory biomarkers [monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), systemic inflammatory index (SII), Systemic Inflammation Response Index (SIRI), and Aggregate Index of Systemic Inflammation (AISI)] and the CT Severity Score in acute limb ischemia (ALI) risk, intensive unit care (ICU) admission, and mortality in COVID-19 patients.; Methods: The present study was designed as an observational, analytical, retrospective cohort study and included all patients older than 18 years of age with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, confirmed through real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and admitted to the County Emergency Clinical Hospital of Targu-Mureș, Romania, and Modular Intensive Care Unit of UMFST “George Emil Palade” of Targu Mures, Romania between January 2020 and December 2021. Results: Non-Survivors and “ALI” patients were associated with higher incidence of cardiovascular disease [atrial fibrillation (AF) p = 0.0006 and p = 0.0001; peripheral arterial disease (PAD) p = 0.006 and p < 0.0001], and higher pulmonary parenchyma involvement (p < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed a high baseline value for MLR, NLR, PLR, SII, SIRI, AISI, and the CT Severity Score independent predictor of adverse outcomes for all recruited patients (all p < 0.0001). Moreover, the presence of AF and PAD was an independent predictor of ALI risk and mortality. Conclusions: According to our findings, higher MLR, NLR, PLR, SII, SIRI, AISI, and CT Severity Score values at admission strongly predict ALI risk, ICU admission, and mortality. Moreover, patients with AF and PAD had highly predicted ALI risk and mortality but no ICU admission."

    "abstract": "Chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers are epidemic, which bring huge burdens to both the patients and the society. However, with current treatment methods, diabetic foot ulcers often heal poorly and recur frequently, so it is urgent and important to find new and advanced therapies. Stem cell therapy has been proved by a large number of pre-clinical and clinical studies as a potential treatment for chronic wounds. However, the acquisition of stem cells often depends on invasive techniques, and immunogenicity and limited cell survival in vivo also limit the large-scale application and promotion of stem cell therapy. In the recent years, with the development and advance of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, it has shown a strong translational potential in the treatment of chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers. This article reviews the applications and prospect of iPSCs in animal wound healing models including diabetic ulcers and limb ischemia, the limitations of their clinical application, and the methods to improve their safety. 糖尿病足溃疡等慢性创伤在人群中广泛流行，给患者和社会都带来了巨大的负担。而在现有的治疗方式下，糖尿病足溃疡往往愈合不良且容易复发，因此找寻新型疗法显得尤为迫切和重要。干细胞疗法作为一种新兴的治疗方式，其在糖尿病足溃疡愈合中的作用已得到大量基础和临床研究的证实。然而，由于获取干细胞往往依赖于侵入性手段，免疫排斥和移植后的细胞存活率低等问题也限制了干细胞疗法的大规模应用和推广。近年来，随着诱导多能干细胞（iPSC）技术的发展和进步，其在糖尿病足溃疡的治疗中表现出很强的转化潜能。该文将围绕iPSC在包括糖尿病溃疡和肢体缺血在内的创伤愈合动物模型中的应用及前景、临床应用的局限性和改善安全性的方法展开综述。."

During the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, thrombotic complications due to hypercoagulable state have emerged as an important issue. Acute limb ischemia is one of emergency cases in vascular disease caused by a sudden decrease in arterial limbs perfusion. Here, we report a 53-year-old male patient with severe COVID-19 and a history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who developed extensive arterial thrombosis and limb ischemia despite being on therapeutic-dose anticoagulation, requiring surgical intervention. Right and left leg open thrombectomy was performed at day 7 after admission due to the excruciating pain and the worsening of the limb conditions. The patient was transferred to intensive care unit in emergency room because of the unstable hemodynamic and passed away a few hours after the surgery. For critically ill patients with COVID-19, special attention should be paid to abnormal coagulation dysfunction and microcirculatory disorders."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is a vascular emergency associated with high rates of limb loss and mortality. Management of these patients is challenging given the severe systemic illness resulting from tissue ischemia and the high incidence of preexisting comorbid conditions and underlying peripheral arterial disease. Expeditious diagnosis, anticoagulation, and revascularization are of utmost importance in reducing morbidity. Revascularization may be accomplished using open, endovascular, or hybrid techniques. Approach to revascularization depends on the severity of ischemia, location of occlusion, cause, chance of recovery, comorbidities, and available resources."

The admission blood glucose (ABG)/estimated average glucose (eAG) value has recently been shown as a prognostic marker in acute cardiovascular events. In this study, we aimed to investigate the predictive role of an ABG/eAG value in predicting development of early postoperative major amputation after emergency thromboembolectomy operations in patients presenting with ALI. Patients who admitted to our hospital with ALI between November 01, 2016 and September 01, 2021 and underwent surgical thromboembolectomy were retrospectively included in the study. Patients who did not undergo postoperative limb amputation were recorded as Group 1, and patients who underwent major amputation in the early postoperative period (in-hospital), were recorded as Group 2. The median age of the 226 patients included in Group 1 and 72 patients in Group 2 were 58 (34-86) years and 69 (33-91) years, respectively (p<0.001). In univariate analysis, in-hospital amputation was found to significantly correlate with age>70 years (odds ratio [OR]: 1.914, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.351-2.319, p<0.001), PAD (OR: 1.698, 95% CI: 1.270-1.992, p = 0.002 re-embolectomy (OR: 2.184, 95% CI: 1.663-3.085, p < 0.001), admission Rutherford class (OR: 0.762, 95% CI: 0.591-0.859, p = 0.032), admission time>6 h (OR: 1.770, 95% CI: 1.480-1.152, p = 0.009), ABG (OR: 1.275, 95% CI: 1.050-1.790, p < 0.001), and ABG/eAG (OR: 1.669, 95% CI: 1.315-2.239, p < 0.001). According to our study, we can predict patient groups with a high risk of major amputation with the ABG/eAG value calculated from the blood values of the patients at the time of admission."

An interdisciplinary team formed of urological and vascular surgeons decided and performed a one-step operation. The right kidney was removed, and the limb revascularization was achieved by performing a bypass that used the right renal arterial stump as an inflow artery, thus called a reno-femoral bypass. The AAA had no indication for reconstruction. The final pathology interpretation of the kidney tumor revealed a clear cell renal cell carcinoma, excised with oncological safety margins. A short-term follow-up found the patient without ischemic symptomatology and a fully functional graft."

However, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) remains a serious complication in these patients. Clinical case: We report an unusual case of thrombosis due to severe HIT in a 75-year-old female patient following intramedullary nailing for a hip fracture. The patient was taking Verapamine. On the fourth postoperative day she developed paralysis, paresthesia and mild pain over the right lower extremity; faint pulses were palpated. Computed tomography angiogram identified superficial artery occlusion leading to limb ischemia. Anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4) heparin antibody positivity confirmed the diagnosis of HIT. Urgent embolectomy was performed and the patient achieved full recovery. Discussion: Arterial embolism presenting with severe neurological deficits is a rare complication of HIT. Conclusion:A high index of suspicion and close platelet count monitoring is warranted for early diagnosis and treatment of this devastating condition that can be limb and life threatening."

This case series presents 4 patients who underwent HD. The procedure was performed due to various indications including necrotizing fasciitis, gangrene, stump necrosis from previous above-the-knee amputation, and septic joint secondary to chronic osteomyelitis, 3 of which were planned and 1 was emergent. The procedure was performed successfully in all 4 patients. Furthermore, all patients were eventually discharged to home or to a long-term care facility for wound care or rehabilitation. Overall, HD should be reserved as a life-saving treatment for various indications including infections that fail other modalities, limb ischemia, trauma, and malignancy. Ideally, this procedure would be planned and performed on proper candidates; however, HD should still be a consideration in the emergent setting regardless of most optimal patients due to its life-saving potential."

    "abstract": "A well-known complication of COVID-19 is hypercoagulability in both the venous and arterial circulation. Most cases of hypercoagulability-related complications have been described in hospitalized patients with severe diseases and multiple comorbidities. However, this report outlines a case of myocardial infarction in a young patient with no prior medical history after only a mild course of COVID-19. His symptoms resolved after a mild 12-day illness course that did not require hospitalization or supplemental oxygen. Three days after the resolution of his symptoms (15 days after testing positive), the patient presented to the emergency department with crushing chest pain and was found to have complete thrombotic occlusion of his left anterior descending artery. Hypercoagulability in COVID-19 patients is suspected to be caused by vascular endothelial injury and cytokine storm. This has been demonstrated in the arterial and venous circulation, as seen in histopathology samples as well as increased incidence of acute limb ischemia in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, COVID-19 is known to have myocardial involvement, as demonstrated by elevations in cardiac enzymes and cardiac imaging findings that may persist months after initial infection. Those affected by COVID-19 may have dangerous cardiovascular complications that persist after the resolution of the acute viral illness."

This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of General Surgery, Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad, from April 2017 to August 2017. A total of 96 patients with critical limb ischemia requiring urgent surgery for limb salvage were included in our study. Patients who had undergone previous surgeries for limb ischemia involving the same limb, had concurrent venous disease, or suffered from acute limb ischemia were excluded. All patients underwent either endoscopic angioplasty or bypass surgery. All patients were followed up for six months for the success of limb salvage and the requirement for amputation. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 26.0 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). Our patients had a mean age of 62.03±8.46 years, of whom 63 (65.6%) were men. A total of 47 (49.0%) patients required surgery for a non-healing ulcer, while 49 (51.0%) had resting leg pain. In 55 (57.3%) patients, bypass surgery was performed, while 35 (36.5%) underwent endoscopic angioplasty. The remaining six (6.2%) patients received a combination of both procedures. Limb salvage was successful in 78 (81.3%) patients. There was no difference between outcomes across gender (p=0.122), nor was there any difference in outcome between bypass surgery and endoscopic angioplasty (p=0.665). Encouraging results can be obtained in treatment of critical limb ischemia if revascularization techniques are utilized prudently in a time-effective manner and individualized to each patient's requirements."

Mortality in PCD ranges 20-40%. Due to severely compromised venous drainage, compartment pressures can rapidly increase 16-fold within 6 h, but rarely result in arterial compromise. We present a case of a middle-aged woman with no prior history of deep venous thrombosis, with a blue swollen left leg in intractable severe pain unresponsive to 3 doses of hydromorphone. Her pain was successfully alleviated with IV Lidocaine. Patient was found to have phlegmasia cerulea dolens resulting in compartment syndrome of her left leg. Although the patient initially had no motor function, after catheter-directed thrombolysis and emergent thrombectomy, she regained her motor function and made a full recovery. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Phlegmasia cerulea dolens complicated by severe compartment syndrome is a rare entity. Prompt recognition and treatment are necessary to prevent irreversible limb ischemia and associated morbidity and mortality. IV Lidocaine may be considered as an option for analgesia for such patients."

    "abstract": "Iliac artery aneurysms (IAA) can exist in isolation or in combination abdominal aortic aneurysmal disease. Isolated IAA are rare, often asymptomatic and will present with compression of local structures or incidentally on imaging. Treatment depends on symptomology and size. While endovascular repair has become the preferred method in recent years, for patients with extensive aneurysmal disease, the standard of care is surgical procedure. Acute limb ischemia (ALI) related to aneurysmal disease can occur by progression of untreated disease or rarely, as a complication of its repair. A man in his 70s who had previously undergone aorto-bifemoral repair for severe aorto-iliac aneurysmal disease nine years prior presented to the emergency department (ED) with a cold left lower extremity concerning for ALI. Emergent aortogram revealed progression of aneurysmal disease with extrinsic graft compression by a giant left iliac aneurysm and femoral artery thrombosis. He underwent femoral artery thrombectomy, bilateral graft limb stent placement and left femoral graft anastomosis balloon angioplasty with stent placement achieving restoration of limb flow and resolution of symptoms. He was discharged and unfortunately lost in follow up. He returned eight months later with mixed shock due to a ruptured left iliac aneurysm. Despite aggressive treatment measures, patient progressed to multi-organ failure, cardiopulmonary arrest, and death. Our case illustrates an unusual mechanism of ALI by extrinsic graft compression from an expanding left IAA over the course of eight years through delayed retrograde collateral flow. It highlights its life-threating late complications and the importance of close follow-up after abdominal aneurysm surgical repair."

Increasing evidence suggests that various biomarkers can predict amputation at the time of admission. Identifying an easily obtainable and inexpensive indicator has always been a major objective. The aim of this study was to determine the predictive value of the admission monocyte count to the HDL-C ratio for a lower extremity amputation in patients undergoing embolectomy for acute limb ischemia. This retrospective, single-center study included 269 patients who underwent an emergent embolectomy. The study population was divided into two groups according to early amputation: the non-amputation group (n = 220) and the amputation group (n = 49). Two groups were compared based on various data. According to the multivariate regression analysis, patients with a higher CRP and MHR have a significantly higher amputation rate (HR: 1.148; CI: 1.075-1.225; p < 0.001 and HR: 1.547; CI: 1.003-2.387; p = 0.04, respectively). Patients with arterial back bleeding have a significantly lower amputation rate (HR: 0.106; CI: 0.02-0.558; p = 0.008).

Patients in the severe stages of PAD are prone to amputation and death, leading to poor quality of life and a great socioeconomic burden. Furthermore, PAD is one of the major complications of diabetic patients, who have higher risk to develop critical limb ischemia, the most severe manifestation of PAD, and thus have a poor prognosis. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop an effective therapeutic strategy to treat this disease. Therapeutic angiogenesis has raised concerns for more than two decades as a potential strategy for treating PAD, especially in patients without option for surgery-based therapies. Since the discovery of gene-based therapy for therapeutic angiogenesis, several approaches have been developed, including cell-, protein-, and small molecule drug-based therapeutic strategies, some of which have progressed into the clinical trial phase. Despite its promising potential, efforts are still needed to improve the efficacy of this strategy, reduce its cost, and promote its worldwide application.

In this study, we analyzed morbidity and mortality in patients presenting for emergent lower extremity thrombectomy and embolectomy in the transferred and nontransferred populations. A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was performed utilizing the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database for all nonelective, emergent lower extremity embolectomy or thrombectomy (Current Procedural Terminology [CPT] 34,201 and 34,203) performed between 2011 and 2014. Demographics, comorbidities, and 30-day complications, and outcomes were compared among patients presenting from home versus those presenting from another hospital, emergency department, or nursing home. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the association between mode of presentation, major complications, and death. We identified 1,954 patients who underwent emergent lower extremity embolectomy or thrombectomy. 40.7% (795 patients) were identified as transfer patients. Odds of transfer were significantly increased if a patient was functionally dependent (odds ratio OR 1.95, P < 0.001) or had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR 1.348, P = 0.05). Odds of transfer were decreased if a patient was of a nonWhite race (OR 0.511, P < 0.001). 11.7% (229) patients in the described cohort died within 30 days of surgery. Those who died were more likely to present to the treating hospital as a transfer (56.3% vs. 38.6%, P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, transfer status was significantly associated with 30-day mortality (OR 1.9: 95% confidence interval CI 1.40-2.64; P < 0.001). Patients transferred from an outside hospital or nursing home who present for emergent vascular procedures demonstrated increased mortality compared to those who present from home direct to the emergency department despite similar comorbid conditions. In addition, race was identified as an independent factor for transfer. Further studies are needed to understand the complex interactions between inter-hospital transfer patterns, emergency vascular surgery presentations, and racial biases to improve outcomes for this population."

    "abstract": "Vascular complications are a cause of increased morbidity and mortality when performing percutaneous procedures requiring large-bore arterial access. MANTA vascular closure device (VCD) is currently the only large-bore VCD using an intraluminal foot plate and an extraluminal collagen plug. The traditional depth locator approach might be compromised in; emergent cases without the required measurements, cases of hematoma formation, or other patient, procedure, or operator-specific variables. Furthermore, this technique can be used for postclosure in cases without the required measurement of depth. We describe vascular outcomes using fluoroscopy (fluoroscopic DOT technique) rather than traditional depth locator approach for vascular closure with the MANTA VCD. Fifty patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) were retrospectively analyzed using fluoroscopic DOT technique with 18F MANTA VCD between May and August 2021. All patients >18 years of age who qualified for transfemoral TAVI were included. Access was obtained with ultrasound guidance with vessel diameter of at least > 6 mm and free from anterior vessel wall calcification. Patient related factors and primary outcomes of access site bleeding and acute flow-limited limb ischemia requiring intervention were prospectively analyzed. Furthermore, 1 patient who failed hemostasis with suture-mediated VCD had successful hemostasis with fluoroscopic DOT technique as dry postclosure after balloon aortic valvuloplasty. In total, 50 patients were analyzed with a mean age of 81 years and majority were male (56%). Majority had comorbidities of hypertension (88%) and hyperlipidemia (94%), 24% had peripheral arterial disease, 38% coronary artery disease, and 58% were former smokers. Importantly, 40% were obese with an average body mass index (BMI) of 29 kg/m2. There were no bleeding or ischemic limb complications post MANTA VCD deployment using the fluoroscopic DOT technique. Furthermore, none of the patients required peripheral intervention from index procedure to 1 month post verified during their 1-month post TAVR follow-up. Fluoroscopic DOT technique using the MANTA VCD is highly reproducible and allows hemostasis in a predictable manner for procedures requiring large-bore arterial access in the absence of MANTA depth measurement."

This observational, analytical, and retrospective cohort study with longitudinal follow-up aimed to confirm the relevance of the preoperative inflammatory biomarkers neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in predicting the 30-day poor prognosis of patients with Rutherford classification (RC) grades II and III ALI. The ROC analysis found a strong association of an NLR > 4.33 with all studied outcomes, while a PLR > 143.34 was associated with all studied outcomes, except the composite endpoint in all RC stages. Depending on the optimal cut-off value, the ROC analysis found a higher incidence of all adverse outcomes in all high NLR (>4.33) and high PLR (>143.34) groups. A multivariate analysis showed that a high baseline value for NLR and PLR was an independent predictor of amputation (OR:11.09; 95% CI: 5.48−22.42; p < 0.0001; and OR:8.97; 95% CI: 4.44−18.16; p < 0.0001), mortality (OR:22.24; 95% CI: 9.61−51.47; p < 0.0001; and OR:8.32; 95% CI: 3.90−17.73; p < 0.0001), and composite endpoint (OR:21.93; 95% CI: 7.91−60.79; p < 0.0001; and OR:9.98; 95% CI: 3.89−25.55; p < 0.0001), respectively.

The NLR and PLR are excellent predictors of risks associated with ALI for primary and secondary prevention. Our study showed that increased pre-operative values for NLR and PLR are indicators of a poor outcome in patients with RC grades II and III ALI."

    "abstract": "Access to surgical service is limited by provider availability and geographic barriers. Telemedicine ensures that patients can access medical care. The objective is to describe our use of telemedicine in delivering vascular surgery services to remote locations before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a retrospective chart review analyzing care delivered at six vascular surgery telemedicine clinics over a 22-month period. We examined vascular diagnoses, recommended interventions, referrals placed, and emergency department visits within 30 days of evaluation. We calculated travel distance saved for patients between their local clinic and our main hospital. We identified 94 patients and 144 telemedicine visits, with an average of 1.5 visits per patient (SD = 0.73). The most common referrals were for peripheral artery disease (20.2%) and abdominal aortic aneurysm (14.9%). Three patients were immediately referred to the emergency department due to concern for acute limb ischemia (2) or questionable symptomatic AAA (1). Telemedicine visit recommendations were distributed between no intervention (n = 30, 31.9%), medical management (n = 41, 43.6%), and surgical intervention (n = 23, 24.5%).The surgical intervention cohort was most commonly referred to arterial revascularization (n = 4), venous ablation (n = 4), and arteriovenous fistula procedures (n = 4). Fourteen patients came to our main hospital for surgery and four to local providers. Average travel distance saved per telemedicine visit was 104 miles (SD = 43.7). Telemedicine provided safe, efficient care during the COVID-19 pandemic and saved patients an average of 104 travel miles per visit."

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to describe and analyze changes in the incidences of lower extremity amputations (LEAs), patient characteristics, vascular history of amputees and survival in Southwest Finland. This is a retrospective patient study in the Hospital District of Southwest Finland. All consecutive patients with atherosclerosis and diabetes-caused LEA, between 1st January 2007 and 31st December 2017, were included. The annual incidences of major LEA patients were statistically standardized. Patients' diagnoses, functional status, previous revascularizations and minor amputations were recorded, and survival was analyzed. During the 11-year-period major LEAs were performed on 891 patients, 118 (13.2%) were urgent operations. The overall incidence of major LEA was 17.2/100 000 and was age-dependent (3.1 for ≤64 years, 34.3 for 65-74 years, 81.5 for 75-84 years, 216 for ≥85 years). A decrease in incidence was detected in the <65 year-age-group (incidence 4.98 in 2007 and 1.88 in 2017; p = 0.0018). Among older age groups, there was no significant change. Half (50.6%) of all amputees were diabetics. Altogether, 472 patients (53.0%) had a history of revascularization before LEA. 80.1% of index amputations were transfemoral and 19.9% transtibial. Re-surgery was performed on 94 (10.5%) patients. The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival were 56%, 30%, and 18%, respectively. Our results suggest that in an aging population, despite good availability of vascular services, a significant number of patients are not fit for active revascularization, and LEA is the only feasible treatment for critical limb ischemia."

    "abstract": "Contained chronic rupture of aortic aneurysm (CCR-AA) is a rare condition that can be associated with vertebral body erosion (VBE) and is often a diagnostic challenge; in fact, CCR-AAs are in general hemodynamically stable and the patients tend to present with a non-specific low-back pain syndrome secondary to vertebral involvement. Furthermore, the differential diagnosis of a retroperitoneal mass can be difficult on medical imaging. We discuss the case of a 79-years-old man, heavy smoker without history of cardiovascular diseases, admitted to the emergency department with signs of left lower limb ischemia. The patient was hemodynamically stable and the medical examination revealed a pulsatile abdominal mass. Doppler ultrasound showed the presence of aneurysmal dilatation of infra-renal abdominal aorta and chronic femoropopliteal occlusion on the left side. The subsequent computed tomography angiography (CTA) demonstrated a voluminous retroperitoneal mass continuous with the infra-renal aorta, which infiltrated the psoas muscles and caused vertebral bodies erosion of the anterior wall in L2, L3 and L4 suspected for CCR-AA or mycotic aortic aneurysm. Furthermore, the examination confirmed the occlusion of the peripheral arterial circulation of the left lower limb. The patient underwent a successful open replacement of the infra-renal abdominal aorta through aorto-aortic prosthetic graft insertion; the visualization during the surgical procedure of a posterior vessel wall opening in continuity with the eroded vertebral bodies associated with negative microbiological culture of the thrombotic material sample, led to the definitive diagnosis of CCR-AA. The post-operative CTA showed successful open vascular treatment. A bypass surgery of the left lower limb was then performed with positioning saphenous graft between femoral common artery and posterior tibial artery. The patient was finally discharged in good clinical conditions."

    "title": "Evidence-Based Nursing Model in Interventional Thrombolysis for Acute Lower Extremity Arterial Embolism.",
    "abstract": "Acute lower extremity arterial embolism (AE) is a serious clinical emergency, and, if not treated in time, it can easily lead to limb ischemia and necrosis and eventually facing amputation, which seriously damages patients' physical and mental health. In the past, the conventional drug thrombolytic therapy had slow and limited efficacy, and the best time for treatment is easily delayed, while arterial dissection and thrombectomy treatment, although fast, is traumatic and has many complications, which is not easily accepted by patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the value of evidence-based care model in the application of interventional thrombolysis for acute lower limb arterial embolism. Seventy-two patients with acute lower limb arterial embolism who underwent interventional thrombolysis treatment received by the Department of Vascular Surgery of our hospital from July 2016 to December 2021 were randomly divided into a control group (given conventional nursing services) and a quality group (given full quality nursing services) to compare the effect of nursing services in the two groups. The results showed that the postoperative psychological status of patients in the quality group was significantly better than that of patients in the control group (P < 0.05). The total incidence of postoperative adverse events and the total treatment efficiency of the quality group were better than those of the control group (P < 0.05). The efficacy of quality nursing care in patients with acute lower extremity arterial embolism is more desirable than conventional nursing care and is recommended. The site of vascular occlusion after bypass surgery can be clarified when angiography is performed after thrombolytic therapy, which can help secondary surgical intervention to prolong the time to patency. The efficacy of quality nursing care in patients with acute lower extremity arterial embolism is more desirable than that of conventional nursing care and is recommended."

    "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, cardiovascular patients were found to be presenting to hospitals with myocardial infarctions and cerebrovascular accidents at progressed disease states. We noticed a parallel in acute limb ischemia (ALI) patients presenting during Massachusetts' COVID-19 State of Emergency declaration. We question whether patients developed a hesitancy to seek medical attention at hospitals due to fear of COVID-19. Our objective was to compare acuity of ALI, interventions, and limb survival in patients presenting before, during, and after a state of emergency. Four timeframes were set to compare patients presenting peri-2020 COVID-19 State of Emergency and patients presenting during a pre-pandemic era at a tertiary, academic institution. A reference period from 2019, Pre-State of Emergency period, State of Emergency period, and Post-State of Emergency period were designated. Patient characteristics, interventions, and outcomes data were collected. Unpaired t-test, ANOVA, and Chi-square statistical analyses were used. A total of 95 patients presenting with ALI were identified. Compared to Reference group, state of emergency group had more patients presenting with Rutherford Class III, 12.9% vs 35%, and less patient presenting with Class I, 45.1% vs 0%, P = .02. State of emergency group had more delayed presentations with ≥6 hours after symptom onset, 45% vs 85%, P = .01. Above-knee amputations were performed in 20% of patients during state of emergency and 31.6% for Post-State of Emergency, vs 6.5% in the Reference group; P = .03. There was no difference in intensive care unit admission, length of stay, or mortality between patients from different groups. During a state of emergency, ALI patients were noted to present later from symptom onset, have greater disease severity, and more likely to undergo amputations. We suspect delay in presentation and limb lost to be attributed to reluctance to seek immediate medical attention."

    "title": "Embolic Protection Devices are Not Associated with Improved Outcomes of Atherectomy for Lower Extremity Revascularization.",
    "abstract": "Atherectomy is associated with a risk of distal embolization, but the role of embolic protection devices (EPDs) during atherectomy is not well-defined. This study examines the utilization and impact of EPD on the outcomes of atherectomy during peripheral vascular interventions (PVIs). The annual trend in utilization of EPD during atherectomy in the Vascular Quality Initiative PVI files (2010-2018) was derived. Patients with concomitant open surgery, acute limb ischemia, emergent-status, concomitant thrombolysis, missing indication, missing EPD use, and missing long-term follow-up data were excluded. The characteristics of patients undergoing atherectomy with and without EPD were compared. Propensity matching based on age, gender, race, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, end-stage renal disease, prior PVI, indication, urgent-status, TransAtlantic interSociety Consensus classification, and anatomical location of lesion was performed. The perioperative and 1-year outcomes of the matched groups were compared. EPD was used in 23.3% of atherectomy procedures (n = 5,013/21,500). The utilization of EPD with atherectomy increased from 8.8% to 22.7% (P = 0.003) during the study period. Patients undergoing atherectomy without EPD were more likely to have ESRD (7.8% vs. 5.2%; P < 0.001), tissue loss (31% vs. 23.1; P < 0.001), tibial intervention (39.6% vs. 23.3%; P < 0.001), higher number of arteries treated (1.78 ± 0.92 vs. 1.68 ± 0.93; P = 0.001), and longer length of lesion (21.15 ± 21.14 vs. 19 ± 20.27 cm; P = 0.004). Conversely, patients undergoing atherectomy with EPD were more likely to be White (81.1% vs. 74%; P < 0.001), have a history of smoking (80.6% vs. 74.5%; P < 0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (24.8% vs. 21.6%; P < 0.037), coronary artery disease (38.5% vs. 33.2%; P = 0.002), prior percutaneous coronary intervention (24.3% vs. 19.9%, P = 0.005), prior coronary artery bypass grafting (32.3% vs. 24.9%; P < 0.001), and prior PVI (49.2% vs. 45.1%; P = 0.023). After propensity matching, there were 1,007 patients in each group with no significant difference in baseline characteristics. There was no significant difference in short-term outcomes including the rate of distal embolization, technical success, dissection, perforation, discharge to home, and 30-day mortality. The use of EPD was, however, associated with longer fluoroscopy time. At 1-year, there was also no difference in primary patency, ipsilateral minor or major amputation, ankle brachial index improvement, reintervention, or mortality rate between patients who underwent atherectomy with and without EPD. EPD has been increasingly used in conjunction with atherectomy especially in patients with claudication and femoropopliteal disease. However, the use of EPD during atherectomy does not seem to impact the outcomes. Further research is needed to justify the additional cost and fluoroscopy time associated with the use of EPD during atherectomy."

    "title": "[Endovascular interventions for peripheral arterial disease].",
    "abstract": "Successful revascularization of patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) requires a comprehensive understanding of the risk population and the available treatment options. Even the urgency of revascularization varies widely depending on the clinical presentation. Patients with intermittent claudication should undergo a structured exercise program before revascularization may become necessary, whereas acute limb ischemia is a medical emergency and must be revascularized within a few hours. Endovascular treatment techniques have evolved rapidly over the past 20 years. New technologies and procedural techniques allow even complex lesions to be successfully treated with endovascular techniques, and most patients can now be treated minimally invasively in line with an \"endovascular first\" strategy. Bypass surgery remains an important option for patients with advanced disease. The techniques used vary depending on the clinical presentation, location, and complexity of the lesion. Although the evidence for different techniques is limited, a variety of clinical and lesion factors are known to be critical for acute technical success and long-term patency rates. The use of paclitaxel-coated balloons and stents has been shown to significantly reduce restenosis and reintervention rates after femoropopliteal interventions. However, a late mortality signal associated with the use of these devices continues to be debated. After successful intervention, appropriate drug therapy and standardized follow-up should be established to prevent adverse limb events and reduce the high rate of cardiovascular events. Eine erfolgreiche Revaskularisation von Patienten mit peripherer arterieller Verschlusskrankheit (PAVK) erfordert ein umfassendes Verständnis der Risikopopulation und der verfügbaren Behandlungsoptionen. Bereits die Dringlichkeit einer Revaskularisation ist je nach Krankheitsbild sehr unterschiedlich. Patienten mit Claudicatio intermittens sollen vor einer eventuell notwendigen Revaskularisation ein strukturiertes Trainingsprogramm durchlaufen, während eine akute Extremitätenischämie einen medizinischen Notfall darstellt und eine Revaskularisation innerhalb weniger Stunden erforderlich macht. Endovaskuläre Behandlungstechniken haben sich in den letzten 20 Jahren rasant weiterentwickelt. Neue Technologien und Verfahrenstechniken ermöglichen es, selbst komplexe Läsionen erfolgreich endovaskulär zu versorgen; die meisten Patienten können daher heute im Sinne einer „Endovascular-first-Strategie“ minimal-invasiv behandelt werden. Die Bypasschirurgie bleibt eine wichtige Option für Patienten mit fortgeschrittener Erkrankung. Die angewendeten Techniken variieren je nach klinischem Bild, Lage und Komplexität der Läsion. Zwar ist die Evidenz für verschiedene Techniken eingeschränkt, doch sind zahlreiche klinische und läsionsbezogene Faktoren bekannt, die entscheidend sind für den akuten technischen Erfolg und die Langzeitoffenheitsrate. Gerade die Verwendung von paclitaxelbeschichteten Ballons und Stents konnte die Restenose- und Wiedereingriffsrate nach femoropoplitealen Interventionen deutlich reduzieren. Allerdings wird ein spätes Mortalitätssignal in Zusammenhang mit der Verwendung dieser Devices weiterhin diskutiert. Nach erfolgreicher Intervention sollten eine entsprechende medikamentöse Therapie und standardisierte Nachkontrollen etabliert werden, um unerwünschte Extremitätenereignisse zu verhindern und die hohe kardiovaskuläre Ereignisrate zu vermindern."

    "title": "Acute Limb Ischemia in Cogan Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Cogan syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder associated most frequently with ocular, vestibular, and auditory involvement from presumed small vessel vasculitis. Cogan syndrome, in a significant proportion of patients, can progress to systemic symptoms, including gastrointestinal, neurologic, and musculoskeletal manifestations. Large-vessel involvement has also been described in some cases (eg, aortitis), but acute limb ischemia in the setting of this illness has been infrequently reported. CASE REPORT We present a rare case of Cogan syndrome complicated by acute vascular ischemia of the left upper extremity. A 50-year-old man presented with symptoms of severe acute pain and weakness of the left arm. The patient endorsed a diagnosis of Cogan syndrome 4 years prior in the setting of unilateral left-sided hearing loss and bilateral uveitis. A physical examination revealed pallor of the left forearm and pulselessness at the wrist. Computed tomography angiography was suggestive of vasculitis and concerns for embolic occlusion of several arterial structures of the left upper limb. After consultation with various specialists, the patient was treated with high-dose steroids, anticoagulants, and topical nitroglycerin and experienced significant clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of Cogan syndrome with severe systemic manifestations depends on the organ involvement and degree of extension. Our patient's presentation serves as an impressive example of systemic vasculitis with subsequent acute ischemia in the setting of this rare autoimmune disorder. In such a case, given the potential for life- or limb-threatening systemic vascular catastrophes, emergent interventions (including imaging, anticoagulation, and specialist involvement) are required to prevent untoward outcomes."

Herein, we described a reverse \"cheese wire\" endovascular fenestration repair (CWFER) in a patient with complicated abdominal aortic dissection which had never been reported. A 62-year-old male presented abdominal tear-like pain and acute ischemia of the right lower extremity during the endovascular treatment of celiac trunk aneurysms. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) showed abdominal aortic type B dissection with acute ischemia of the right lower extremity preoperatively. After a detailed preoperative examination, the patient then was performed a reverse CWFER. So far, the patient has been followed-up for 6 months, postoperative CTA demonstrated good stent-graft expansion and perfusion of bilateral common iliac arteries; also, no endoleak was detected. The right iliac artery in this patient supplied by false lumen, which lead to acute ischemia of the right lower extremity, needed to be treated as an emergency and dealt with promptly. CWFER is a very high-risk treatment that requires the rich experience of vascular surgeon and accurate assessment of aortic dissection. After interventional treatment, the patient recovered uneventfully after 6 months' follow-up."

    "abstract": "Whether pharmaco-mechanical thrombolysis (PMT) results in superior outcomes to catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) in treating thrombotic or embolic arterial occlusion of the lower limbs is unclear. We enrolled 94 patients with Rutherford class I-IIb due to thrombotic or embolic arterial occlusion in the lower limbs and who received emergency endovascular treatment. Baseline demographics, laboratory data, angiography and clinical outcomes were collected through chart reviews and fluoroscopic imaging. The procedural characteristics (thrombolytic drug dosage, treatment duration, and additional procedures), immediate angiographic outcomes (patency of calf vessels, and complete lysis), complications (major bleeding, and fasciotomy), and primary composite end-points (30-day mortality, amputation, and reocclusion) were compared between patients who received CDT versus PMT. Compared with CDT, PMT was independently associated with lower total UK dosage (standardized coefficient β=- 0.44; P<0.01) and higher prevalence of complete lysis (odds ratio =1.78, 95% confidence interval: 1.03-3.06; P=0.04) after adjustments of covariates. The PMT group had significantly shorter treatment duration (23.00 [7.25-39.13] vs. 41.00 [27.00-52.50]; P<0.01). No significant intergroup differences were observed for the primary composite end point (10.7% vs. 9.1%; P=0.81), or prevalence of the major bleeding (9.1% vs. 0.0%; P=0.10) despite the PMT group comprising patients with more advanced chronic kidney disease and more diffuse thrombosis. PMT with a Rotarex is a safe and effective strategy for treating thrombotic or embolic lower limb ischemia. It significantly reduced the thrombolytic drug dosage, and resulted in the complete lysis being more likely."

    "abstract": "Arterial thoracic outlet syndrome (ATOS) is rare. We present our 30-year experience with the management of ATOS at a high-volume referral center. A retrospective review of all patients who had undergone primary operative treatment for ATOS from 1988 to 2018 was performed. ATOS was defined as subclavian artery pathology caused by extrinsic compression from a bony abnormality within the thoracic outlet. A total of 41 patients (45 limbs) underwent surgery for ATOS at a median age of 46 years (interquartile range [IQR], 34-58 years). Chronic symptoms (>6 weeks) were present in 31 limbs (69%). Of the 45 limbs, 13 (29%) presented with acute limb ischemia (ALI), requiring urgent brachial artery thromboembolectomy (BAT) in 9 and catheter-directed thrombolysis and thrombectomy (CDT) in 4. All patients underwent thoracic outlet decompression. 31 limbs (69%) required subclavian artery reconstruction. No perioperative deaths and only one major adverse limb event occurred. Patients with ALI underwent staged thoracic outlet decompression after initial BAT or CDT at a median of 23 days (IQR, 11-140 days). Of the 13 limbs with an initial presentation of ALI, 8 (62%) had recurrent thromboembolic events before thoracic outlet decompression subsequently requiring 10 additional BATs and 1 CDT. The cumulative probability of recurrent embolization at 14, 30, and 90 days was 8.33% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28%-54.42%), 16.67% (95% CI, 4.70%-59.06%), and 33.33% (95% CI, 14.98-74.20%), respectively. The median follow-up for 32 patients (35 limbs) was 13 months (IQR, 5-36 months). Subclavian artery/graft primary and secondary patency was 87% and 90%, respectively, at 5 years by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Of the 35 limbs, 5 (14%) had chronic upper extremity pain and 5 (14%) had persistent weakness. Preoperative forearm or hand pain and brachial artery occlusion were associated with chronic pain (P = .04 and P = .03) and weakness (P = .03 and P = .02). Of the 13 limbs that presented with ALI, 11 had a median follow-up after thoracic outlet decompression of 6 months (IQR, 5-14 months), including 9 (82%) with oral anticoagulation therapy. Anticoagulation therapy had no effect on subclavian artery patency (P = 1.0) or the presence of chronic symptoms (P = .93). The presentation of ATOS is diverse, and the diagnosis can be delayed. Preoperative upper extremity pain and brachial artery occlusion in the setting of ALI were associated with chronic pain and weakness after thoracic outlet decompression. Delayed thoracic outlet decompression was associated with an increased risk of recurrent thromboembolic events for patients who presented with ALI. An early and accurate diagnosis of ATOS is necessary to reduce morbidity and optimize outcomes."

    "abstract": "The number of office-based procedure centers with the capability of performing a wide range of endovascular procedures has substantially increased over the past decade. This shift in practice settings has occurred faster in the private sector as compared to the academic environment. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of endovascular procedures performed at a dedicated academic outpatient procedural center. We reviewed the clinical data of 400 patients who underwent 499 endovascular procedures in a university-based, academic outpatient procedure center between November 2013 and December 2016. Outcomes analyzed included procedure-related complications, limb loss, mortality, and emergency department visits or hospital admissions that occurred within 30 days following the procedure. The 400 patients had a mean age of 65 ± 13 years with slightly more females (51%; n = 203) as compared to males (49%; n = 197). Most patients (71%; 284) were Caucasian while 80 (20%) were African-Americans. Associated comorbidities included hypertension (86%), diabetes mellitus (51%), chronic kidney disease (42%), and obesity (mean body mass index of 29 ± 6). Based on anesthetic risk, most were ASA class 3 (81%), while ASA 1 and 2 comprised 17% and ASA 4 only 2%. Medicare beneficiaries accounted for 254 (64%) of our patients. Pre-operative studies included mainly duplex ultrasound (62%) and other noninvasive arterial studies (57%).The mean procedural time was 58 min (range, 7 to 200) with an overall technical success rate of 97%. There were no deaths. Complications developed in 10 patients following the 483 procedures (2.1%) being hospitalized with four of them transferred directly to the emergency room. The reasons for these hospitalizations included acute limb ischemia, arterial pseudoaneurysm, deep vein thrombosis, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and lower extremity pain not vascular in origin. Financial reimbursement at the office-based center was higher than that seen with hospital-based procedures. Endovascular procedures performed in an academic office-based procedure center are safe and associated with good clinical outcomes. A small minority of patients have subsequent ER visits or hospital admissions. Academic institutions should consider adding an office-based procedure center based on today's competitive healthcare market."

COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 Infection Disease 2019) infections, prematurity, deferoxamine treatment, iron overload, neutropenia, diabetes, and malignant hemopathies proved to be risk factors for mucormycosis. We present the case of a 7-year-old boy who was treated every three weeks with blood transfusion for major beta-thalassemia, receiving deferoxamine for secondary hemochromatosis. After two weeks with nonspecific respiratory and digestive symptoms, he was admitted for fever, followed by lower limb ischemia and neurological signs. Echocardiography revealed massive endocarditis affecting the mitral and tricuspid valves with embolization phenomena in the brain, lungs, kidney, spleen, and lower limbs. As a particular finding, IgG antibodies for COVID-19 were positive. Emergency cardiac surgery was performed. The mitral valve necessitated replacement with CarboMedics prosthesis. Unfortunately, the patient did not survive. Cunninghamella spp. was confirmed via the PCR analysis of vegetations. Cunninghamella endocarditis in the context of a systemic infection presented as an opportunistic infection affecting a child who had several risk factors. Mucormycosis is challenging to treat, with high mortality. Prophylactic treatment in beta-thalassemia patients with iron-chelator deprivation drugs, such as deferiprone, may help in preventing these particular fungal infections."

    "title": "[Catheter-directed thrombolysis in acute critical limb ischemia].",
    "abstract": "Introduction: Acute limb ischemia has great clinical significance due to its common occurrence and serious complications. Besides open surgical intervention, catheter-directed thrombolysis is a proven treatment alternative, however, it is not widely used in Hungary. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of catheter-directed thrombolysis in acute limb ischemia. Methods: In a retrospective single-center study, we analyzed the data of 40 patients (mean age: 64, SD: ±11.79; 25 men, 69.57%) who underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis due to acute limb ischemia at Semmelweis University Heart and Vascular Centre between 01. 03. 2012 and 31. 12. 2019. Results: 42 thrombolysis were performed on 40 patients. The median alteplase dose was 5 mg (IQR: 5), the median continuous dose was 2 mg/h (IQR: 0.8). 23 (54.76%) procedures were successful and 16 (69.57%) cases required further percutaneous interventions. Hemorrhage led to 5 and occlusion to 3 emergency interventions. The most common postoperative complications were amputation (17.5%), hematoma (11.9%) and distal embolisation (7.14%). 16 (40%) cases required late reintervention at the surgical site. 11 (27.5%) cases needed major amputation. 30 day postoperative mortality was 2.5%. Average intervention-free survival was 1626 days (SD: ±1710), while average amputation-free survival was 2038 days (SD: ±1665). Additional intravenous heparin given during thrombolysis did not affect reocclusion rate and amputation-free survival. Conclusion: Catheter-directed thrombolysis is a therapeutic option in acute limb ischemia. Successful thrombolysis often requires endovascular intervention at the same time. Frequent early complications and late reinterventions have to be considered. Further studies are needed for developing specific therapeutic protocol. Orv Hetil. 2022; 163(11): 424–430. Bevezetés: Az akut alsó végtagi ischaemia nagy klinikai jelentőségét gyakori előfordulása és súlyos szövődményei (amputáció, halálozás) okozzák. A műtéti megoldás mellett a katéterrel végzett thrombolysis jelent terápiás lehetőséget, használata azonban nem terjedt el széles körben hazánkban. Célkitűzés: A katéterrel végzett thrombolysis hatékonyságának és biztonságosságának megállapítása akut alsó végtagi ischaemia esetén. Módszer: A Semmelweis Egyetem Városmajori Szív- és Érgyógyászati Klinikáján 2012. 03. 01. és 2019. 12. 31. között akut alsó végtagi ischaemia miatt katéteres thrombolysisen átesett 40 beteg (átlagéletkor: 64 év, SD: ±11,79; 25 férfi, 62,5%) adatait elemeztük retrospektív vizsgálat során. Eredmények: 40 páciens esetében 42 katéteres lysist hajtottunk végre. A medián alteplázbolus 5 mg (IQR: 5), a medián folyamatos dózis 2 mg/h (IQR: 0,8) volt. A lysisek közül 23 (54,76%) volt sikeres, ebből 16 (69,57%) esetben végeztünk kiegészítő percutan beavatkozást. Vérzés miatt 5 (11,9%), elzáródás miatt 3 (7,14%) betegen végeztünk sürgős beavatkozást. A leggyakoribb posztoperatív szövődmény az amputáció (17,5%), a haematoma (11,9%) és a distalis embolisatio (7,14%) volt. 16 (40%) esetben végeztünk a lizált érszakaszon később beavatkozást. 11 (27,5%) betegnél történt major amputáció. A posztoperatív 30 napon belüli mortalitás 2,5% volt. Az átlagos beavatkozásmentes időszak 1626 nap (SD: ±1710), az átlagos amputációmentes túlélés 2038 nap (SD: ±1665) volt. A lysis alatt adott intravénás heparin nem befolyásolta a nyitva maradást és az amputációt. Következtetés: A katéterrel végzett thrombolysis terápiás lehetőség akut alsó végtagi ischaemia esetén. Sikeres lysis esetén is gyakran kell endovascularis intervenciót végezni. Katéteres thrombolysis alkalmazásakor számolni kell a gyakori korai szövődmény és a késői reintervenció veszélyével. A pontos terápiás protokoll kialakításához további vizsgálatokra van szükség. Orv Hetil. 2022; 163(11): 424–430."

    "abstract": "Chimneys and periscopes are often used to treat pararenal or thoracoabdominal aneurysms de novo or after failed open or endovascular repair. We sought to describe our institutional experience, given their limited success and questionable long-term outcomes. We retrospectively reviewed the electronic records for patients treated with chimneys/periscopes from 1997 through 2020. Baseline characteristics, procedural details, periprocedural complications, reinterventions, and midterm outcomes were collected. Fifty-eight patients (86 vessels) were treated; the median follow-up was 32 months (range, 0.03-104 months). There were 36% (n = 21) juxta-renal, 2% (n = 1) para-visceral, and 21% (n = 12) thoracoabdominal aneurysms, and 41% (n = 24) had pararenal failure of prior endovascular aneurysm repair (n = 17) or open repair (n = 7). Stent configuration for the majority of the 86 vessels (n = 80; 93%) treated were chimney configuration (n = 6 periscopes; 7%). The most common stent graft utilized was Viabahn, and 8.1% (n = 7) were reinforced with a bare metal stent. Although the majority of the cases were elective, 36.2% (n = 21) of the cases were urgent/emergent. At the conclusion of the initial procedure, 16 of 58 patients had an endoleak (gutter, 50% [8/16]; type Ia, 25% [4/16]; and type II, 25% [4/16]). On follow-up, 14 of 58 patients developed one or more endoleaks, with the most common endoleaks being a gutter endoleak (35% [7/20]). Other endoleaks observed included 30% (6/20) type III, 15% (3/20) type Ia, 15% (3/20) type Ib, and 5% (1/20) type II. Eleven of 58 patients underwent interventions for one or more endoleak (gutter, 33% [5/15]; type Ib, 20% [3/15]; type II, 7% [1/15]; and type III, 40% [6/15]). Twelve of 58 patients returned to the operating room for one or more procedures during the index hospitalization (five laparotomies, three dialysis access, three acute limb ischemia, and four chimney/periscope interventions). Ten of 58 patients underwent angioplasty/stenting for chimney/periscope compression or occlusion during the follow-up period. Survival was 61.3% at 1 year by Kaplan-Meier analysis (75% for elective, 37% for urgent/emergent) (aneurysm-related death, 22%). Cox hazard modeling showed that aneurysm diameter (hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.004-1.05; P = .02) and urgent/emergent interventions (hazard ratio, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.33-9.74; P = .01) were predictors of mortality. Endovascular repair of aortic aneurysms with chimneys/periscopes is associated with poor outcomes, including limited technical success and aneurysm exclusion, as well as high morbidity and mortality, with a high rate of reinterventions both in the immediate postoperative period and on follow-up. They should be used only when other surgical or endovascular options are not possible."

A 41-year-old man has acute limb ischemia, critical limb ischemia, and diabetes mellitus. Investigation results showed vascular disorders in the lower extremity area with necrosis of the digit I pedis destra. The patient underwent retrograde and antegrade thrombectomy of the right to left femoral artery and amputation of the digit pedis.

    "abstract": "Behçet's disease (BD) is a rare form of systemic vasculitis that affects small to large vessels. It is characterized by mucocutaneous, pulmonary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and neurological manifestations. Large vessel involvement may occur in a third of cases. Veins are usually more affected than arteries. Furthermore aneurysms are the most frequent arterial complication. A 41-year-old man presented with multiple arterial aneurysms. He had previous medical history of a right popliteal aneurysm treated with a reversed femoro-popliteal venous bypass, long-term steroids and immunosuppressive treatment. On admission, diagnostic computed tomography angiography revealed multiple aneurysms, including an 87 mm aneurysm of the femoro-popliteal bypass and an abdominal aortic and left common iliac artery aneurysm. He received an intensification of medical treatment with methylprednisolone and infliximab intravenous infusion. Aorto iliac artery aneurysms were treated by infrarenal bifurcated stent graft implantation. The aneurysm of the venous femoro-popliteal bypass was treated by explantation and prosthetic repair. One month later, he presented with acute right limb ischemia related to occlusion of the right limb of the stent graft despite anticoagulation which was treated by mechanical thrombectomy. Vascular BD can worsen the vascular outcome after surgery. Except in an urgent context, BD must be controlled before surgery. This case report illustrates the importance of combined medical and surgical management, with first BD activity control with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive treatment, then surgical or endovascular treatment."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a tremendous impact on the respiratory tract. In severe COVID-19 infections, patients may experience shock and multiple organ failure. We described 4 cases of severe arterial thrombosis induced by COVID-19 with and without other stressors and their responses to treatment measures. CASE REPORT In Case 1, a 61-year-old man was hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia 2 weeks prior to the presentation of acute upper-limb ischemia after intravenous forearm line insertion. He was classified as IIB and thus underwent emergency thrombectomy followed by 3 months of enoxaparin. Case 2 was a 41-year-old female patient with granulomatosis who was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit due to COVID-19 pneumonia and developed acute upper-limb ischemia. A medical approach using therapeutic heparin was used. Case 3 was a 65-year-old man who was admitted due to COVID-19-related pneumonia and was otherwise medically and surgically free. We assessed and managed a new onset of the lower-limb IIB acute limb ischemia (ALI). Case 4 was a patient with the first COVID-19 presentation of ALI, which was managed accordingly. CONCLUSIONS The development of a thrombotic event in patients with COVID-19 was previously reported. Moreover, different management options and outcomes have been reported in the literature. Therefore, careful planning is needed for procedures such as cannulation or central line insertion to prevent such events. In addition, short-term anticoagulation therapy might be of clinical benefit when planning a procedure or if the patient exhibits minor arterial complications."

    "abstract": "To compare the efficacy of intravenous (IV) lidocaine with standard analgesics (NSAIDS, opioids) for pain control due to any cause in the emergency department. The electronic databases of PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, CENTRAL, and Google Scholar were explored from 1st January 2000 to 30th March 2021 and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IV lidocaine with a control group of standard analgesics were included. Twelve RCTs including 1,351 patients were included. The cause of pain included abdominal pain, renal or biliary colic, traumatic pain, radicular low back pain, critical limb ischemia, migraine, tension-type headache, and pain of unknown origin. On pooled analysis, we found no statistically significant difference in pain scores between IV lidocaine and control group at 15 min (MD: -0.24 95% CI: -1.08, 0.61 I 2 = 81% p = 0.59), 30 min (MD: -0.24 95% CI: -1.03, 0.55 I 2 = 86% p = 0.55), 45 min (MD: 0.31 95% CI: -0.66, 1.29 I 2 = 66% p = 0.53), and 60 min (MD: 0.59 95% CI: -0.26, 1.44 I 2 = 75% p = 0.18). There was no statistically significant difference in the need for rescue analgesics between the two groups (OR: 1.45 95% CI: 0.82, 2.56 I 2 = 41% p = 0.20), but on subgroup analysis, the need for rescue analgesics was significantly higher with IV lidocaine in studies on abdominal pain but not for musculoskeletal pain. On meta-analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of side-effects between the two study groups (OR: 1.09 95% CI: 0.59, 2.02 I 2 = 48% p = 0.78). IV lidocaine can be considered as an alternative analgesic for pain control in the ED. However, its efficacy may not be higher than standard analgesics. Further RCTs with a large sample size are needed to corroborate the current conclusions."

    "abstract": "Arterial diseases represent a severe public health problem in the 21st century. Although men have a higher overall prevalence, reports have suggested that women may exhibit atypical manifestations, be asymptomatic, and have hormonal peculiarities, resulting in worse outcomes and severe emergencies, such as acute limb ischemia (ALI). To analyze the morbidity and mortality profile of ALI emergencies in Brazil between 2008 and 2019. An ecological study was carried out with secondary data from SIH/SUS, using ICD-10 code I.74 The proportions of emergency hospital admissions and in-hospital mortality rates (HMR) by gender, ethnicity, and age were extracted from the overall figures. P<0.05 was considered significant. From 2008 to 2019, there were 195,567 urgent hospitalizations due to ALI in Brazil, 111,145 (56.8%) of which were of men. Women had a higher HMR (112:1,000 hospitalizations) than men (85:1,000 hospitalizations) (p<0.05), and a higher chance of death (OR=1.36; p<0.05). Furthermore, mean survival was significantly higher among men (8,483/year versus 6,254/year; p<0.05). Stratified by ethnicity, women who self-identified as white (OR=1.44; p<0.05), black (OR=1.33; p<0.05), and brown (RR=1.25; p <0.05) had greater chances of death than men in the same ethnicity categories. Moreover, women over the age of 50 years had a higher chance of death, with a progressive increment in risk as age increased. There was a trend to worse prognosis in ALI emergencies associated with women, especially in older groups. The literature shows that the reasons for these differences are still poorly investigated and more robust studies of this relevant disease in the area of vascular surgery are encouraged. Doenças arteriais representam um grave problema de saúde pública no século XXI. Apesar de homens apresentarem maior prevalência geral, estudos sugerem que mulheres podem cursar com quadros assintomáticos, clínica atípica e particularidades hormonais, que resultam em desfechos desfavoráveis e urgências graves, como oclusões arteriais aguda (OAA). Analisar o perfil de morbimortalidade das urgências em OAA no Brasil entre 2008 e 2019. Realizou-se estudo ecológico com dados secundários do Sistema de Informações Hospitalares/Sistema Único de Saúde, utilizando-se o código I.74 do Código Internacional de Doenças-10. Dos números absolutos, obteve-se proporções de internamentos de urgência e taxa de mortalidade intra-hospitalar (TMH) por gênero, etnia e idade. Considerou-se p < 0,05 significativo. Entre 2008 e 2019, houve 195.567 internamentos de urgência por OAA no Brasil, dos quais 111.145 (56,8%) eram homens. Mulheres tiveram maior TMH (112:1.000 hospitalizações) em comparação a homens (85:1.000 hospitalizações) (p < 0,05), assim como maior chance de morte (odds ratio [OR] = 1,36; p < 0,05). Ademais, a média de sobrevida anual foi maior entre homens do que entre mulheres (8.483/ano vs. 6.254/ano, respectivamente; p < 0,05). Estratificando por etnia, mulheres apresentaram maior chance de óbitos entre brancas (OR = 1,44; p < 0,05), pretas (OR = 1,33; p < 0,05) e pardas (razão de risco [RR] = 1,25; p < 0,05), comparadas a homens das mesmas etnias. Nas análises etárias, mulheres com mais de 50 anos apresentaram maior chance de óbito, com aumento progressivo do risco com o envelhecimento. Nossas análises comparativas evidenciaram tendência de pior prognóstico nas urgências em OAA associadas a mulheres, sobretudo em grupos de idade avançada. A literatura evidencia que as razões para essas diferenças ainda são pouco estudadas, estimulando investigações mais robustas sobre essa importante casuística da cirurgia vascular."

    "abstract": "A 40-year-old female patient presented to our cardiology department with typical angina of 1 month's duration. The patient was on a combination of valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide for the treatment of hypertension. Electrocardiography showed a normal sinus rhythm with T-wave negativity in the anterior precordial leads. A cardiovascular stress test with the Bruce protocol revealed 2 mm horizontal ST-segment deviation in the inferior and lateral leads. Therefore, the patient was scheduled to undergo coronary angiography (CAG). Before CAG, she was anxious and stressed; hence, intravenous diazepam was administered. CAG, performed via the right femoral artery, demonstrated an insignificant muscular bridge in the mid-portion of the left anterior descending artery (Figure 1A). Twenty minutes after the procedure, the patient felt numbness in her right lower leg and had difficulties in her movements. On physical examination, there was no pulse in the right lower extremity. Because of the presence of the signs and symptoms of acute lower extremity ischemia, an urgent peripheral angiography via the left femoral artery was performed. It illustrated an acute occlusion in the external iliac artery (EIA) (Figure 1B and Video 1). Afterward, intravenous nitroglycerin and unfractionated heparin (5000 U) were given through the right diagnostic catheter. Following this therapy, antegrade blood flow was achieved in the EIA and the signs and symptoms of acute limb ischemia disappeared (Figure 1C and Video 2). Arterial duplex ultrasonography just after this procedure revealed a retrograde arterial dissection flap without significant stenosis (Figure 1D-E and Video 3). In addition, a triphasic blood-flow pattern was observed in the EIA (Figure 1E). During coronary intensive care, intravenous low-dose nitroglycerin and unfractionated heparin were administered for 48 hours. The in-hospital follow-up of the patient was uneventful, and there were no signs and symptoms of peripheral embolism. Arterial duplex ultrasonography, performed 2 weeks after hospital discharge, showed that there was no residual stenosis and that the dissection flap was sealed. Arterial dissection is an infrequent clinical entity encountered during CAG. Remarkably, even though vasospasm and compression to the access site were other contributing factors, acute EIA occlusion due to retrograde dissection is an extremely rare event. As was shown in our case, medical therapy, including intravenous nitroglycerin and unfractionated heparin, could potentially allow the resolution of the total occlusion of the EIA without necessitating percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or stenting."

    "abstract": "Over 200 million individuals worldwide are estimated to have peripheral artery disease (PAD). Although the term peripheral can refer to any outer branch of the vasculature, the focus of this review is on lower-extremity arteries. The initial sequelae of PAD often include movement-induced cramping pain in the hips and legs or loss of hair and thinning of the skin on the lower limbs. PAD progresses, sometimes rapidly, to cause nonhealing ulcers and critical limb ischemia which adversely affects mobility and muscle tone; acute limb ischemia is a medical emergency. PAD causes great pain and a high risk of amputation and ultimately puts patients at significant risk for major adverse cardiovascular events. The negative impact on patients' quality of life, as well as the medical costs incurred, are huge. Atherosclerotic plaques are one cause of PAD; however, emerging clinical data now shows that nonatherosclerotic medial arterial calcification (MAC) is an equal and distinct contributor. This ATVB In Focus article will present the recent clinical findings on the prevalence and impact of MAC in PAD, discuss the known pathways that contribute specifically to MAC in the lower extremity, and highlight gaps in knowledge and tools that limit our understanding of MAC pathogenesis."

Though diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an established complication of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, its association with PA is extremely rare. Likewise, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and Acute limb ischemia (ALI) have rare, reported association with DKA. We present one such case of rare associations seen in our clinical practice. A 20-year-old woman was brought to our emergency room with headache, breathlessness, and altered sensorium. Clinical and biochemical evaluation revealed SVT, DKA, and right lower limb ALI. On enquiry, the patient was found to be diagnosed with pituitary adenoma 2 years ago and lost to follow-up. PA was detected on neuroimaging and confirmed histopathologically.

We report the case of a 73-year-old woman with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis with a radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula on the right arm that was brought to the emergency department with decreased strength in her right arm, ipsilateral hypoesthesia and facial hemi-hypoesthesia. The patient was given a brain computed tomographic scan that did not confirm suspicion of stroke. On re-examination, the patient had new-onset pain at arteriovenous fistula level, and her right arm was cold and pale. The nephrology department was called for arteriovenous fistula evaluation. On physical examination, her forearm fistula had a decreased thrill and arm elevation exacerbated its paleness. A bedside ultrasound was performed for arteriovenous fistula assessment. Doppler ultrasound revealed: partial thrombosis at brachial bifurcation, a flow of 80-105 mL/min at brachial artery level and a radial artery with a damped waveform. Anastomosis and draining vein were permeable. In this case, the diagnosis of acute embolic brachial artery occlusion was made by a fast bedside ultrasound evaluation. The patient underwent thromboembolectomy with Fogarty technique, recovering fistula thrill, radial and cubital pulses. Thromboembolism of the fistula feeding artery is a rare cause of vascular access thrombosis and it is rarely mentioned in the literature. In this report, failure to recognize the upper limb ischemia would have led to delayed treatment, potentially resulting in the fistula's complete thrombosis and further limb ischemia. We highlight the importance of a diagnosis method like Doppler ultrasound, which allows for rapid evaluation at the patient's bedside."

    "abstract": "Total occlusion of the abdominal aorta is an uncommon but potentially devastating event. Clinical symptoms are usually sudden and may vary depending on the level of the aortic occlusion. Associated morbidity and mortality remain substantial with high rates of limb loss, acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, and death. We report a case of a bedridden 91-year-old woman with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, anemia and dementia, carried to the emergency department because of bilateral lower limb pallor. She had been at the same department the week before because of the same problems and high blood pressure (BP), but had been discharged after administration of hypotensive drugs and a short period of observation. No attention was paid to those perfusion alterations, or the global picture at all. The physical examination revealed cooling of the lower limbs and significant BP differential between upper and lower limbs (ankle-brachial index of 0.173), leading to the suspicion of bilateral acute limb ischemia. Abdominal, pelvic and lower limb CT was conducted, revealing calcification and important atheromatosis of the thoracic-abdominal aorta and a mural thrombus beginning above the origin of the celiac trunk, with complete occlusion below the origin of the renal arteries. After discussion with Vascular Surgery Department, given the advanced age, known co-morbidities and the timing of diagnosis, the patient was considered not eligible for revascularization surgery and comfort measures were honored. This case highlights the importance of stablishing a timely and correct diagnosis, even in the very elderly, emphasizing that they too benefit from secondary and tertiary prophylaxis, in order to prevent devastating outcomes as this."

    "abstract": "Arteriotomy repair through the preclosure technique during elective arterial access procedures is well documented. Outcomes associated with application of this technique to the removal of arterial access cannulas in patients undergoing urgent venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) have not previously been reported. We reviewed the records of consecutive patients who required VA-ECMO for cardiogenic shock. Patients were compared by use of the preclosure device (Perclose ProGlide Suture-Mediated Closure System; Abbott Vascular, Abbott Park, Ill) at time of VA-ECMO cannulation. The rate of limb complications (composite of limb ischemia, infection, and site necrosis) and secondary end points of bleeding events, pseudoaneurysm, distal part embolization, and intensive care unit length of stay after decannulation were compared between the groups. Ninety-nine consecutive patients managed with VA-ECMO were identified and the preclosure device was utilized in 51 of these patients. Preclosure device failure occurred in 5 instances (9.8%) and was successfully managed with surgical repair in 4 cases and endovascular intervention in another. Use of the preclosure device was associated with both fewer limb complications (odds ratio, 0.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.78) and bleeding events (odds ratio, 0.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.89). Pseudoaneurysm (n = 0) and distal part embolization (n = 1) were infrequently encountered in the cohort and no difference in intensive care unit length of stay after decannulation was noted between the groups. In this cohort, use of the preclosure technique in weaning from VA-ECMO was technically feasible, safe, and associated with an approximate 80% lower likelihood of limb complications and bleeding events compared with surgical removal."

    "abstract": "Acute arterial thrombosis after hip arthroplasty is a rare event associated with potentially catastrophic complications. Early clinical diagnosis of progressive limb ischemia is often difficult in the immediate postoperative period because of residual neuraxial blockade and the nonspecific nature of signs. We describe the use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) to diagnose this complication early and facilitate timely intervention. A 78-yr-old female patient underwent elective right hip revision arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia and postoperatively had an absent dorsalis pedis pulse on her operative leg as screened by an audible-only Doppler. No obvious clinical symptoms were present as the patient was still under subarachnoidal blockade. A bedside POCUS vascular evaluation was performed in the PACU and showed an absence of blood flow in the superficial femoral artery, expediting the confirmation of a surgical emergency. The patient underwent a successful open thrombectomy and made an uneventful postoperative recovery. Our case report highlights the novel use and impact of bedside POCUS to assess the presence or absence of distal limb arterial blood flow and, in this case, the level of arterial occlusion. RéSUMé: OBJECTIF: La thrombose artérielle aiguë après arthroplastie de la hanche est un événement rare associé à des complications potentiellement catastrophiques. Le diagnostic clinique précoce de l’ischémie progressive du membre est souvent difficile à poser dans la période postopératoire immédiate en raison du bloc neuraxial résiduel et de la nature non spécifique des signes. Nous décrivons l’utilisation de l’échographie ciblée (POCUS) en salle de réveil (SDR) pour diagnostiquer cette complication rapidement et faciliter une intervention rapide. CARACTéRISTIQUES CLINIQUES: Une patiente de 78 ans a bénéficié d’une arthroplastie non urgente de révision de la hanche droite sous rachianesthésie; après l’intervention, le pouls pédieux, tel que dépisté par un Doppler uniquement sonore, était absent au niveau de la jambe opérée. Aucun symptôme clinique évident n’était présent alors que la patiente était toujours sous bloc sous-arachnoïdien. Une évaluation vasculaire d’échographie ciblée a été réalisée en salle de réveil et montrait l’absence de circulation sanguine dans l’artère fémorale superficielle, confirmant l’urgence chirurgicale. La patiente a bénéficié d’une thrombectomie ouverte réussie et s’est rétablie sans incident après l’opération. CONCLUSION: Notre présentation de cas met en évidence l’utilisation innovante et l’impact de l’échographie ciblée pour évaluer la présence ou l’absence du flux sanguin artériel distal et, dans ce cas, le niveau de l’occlusion artérielle."

    "abstract": "An 84-year-old male patient with no known comorbidity was admitted to the emergency department with complaints of dyspnea and respiratory distress. The patient was referred to the COVID outpatient clinic, laboratory and radiology tests were performed. Thoracic CT scan of the patient showed large peripheral patchy ground glass densities observed in the lower lobes of both lungs. CT imaging findings were evaluated by an experienced radiologist and reported as COVID-19 pneumonia. The patient, who was self-isolated at home for 5 days, presented to the emergency department again on the fifth day with complaints of respiratory distress, fever, bruising with cough, and loss of peripheral pulse in the left lower extremity. Necessary tests were performed on the patient. An above-knee amputation was performed when a diagnosis of limb ischemic necrosis was made and no revascularization attempt was considered by the CVS department. This case study describes the coexistence of sudden lower extremity thrombosis and Covid-19 in our case without a known chronic disease."

    "abstract": "Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) is a multisystemic autoimmune disease characterized by arterial and venous thrombosis and / or obstetric morbidity in the presence of at least one circulating anti-phospholipid antibody. The spectrum of vascular events varies from deep venous thrombosis to catastrophic APS, a rare form characterized by acute multiorgan thrombosis and high mortality. We present the case of a 32-week pregnant woman arriving in the hospital emergency room with bilateral acute lower limb ischemia. In the obstetric evaluation, fetal death was declared. Computerized Tomography angiography showed pulmonary embolism of both pulmonary arteries, areas of splenic and right renal infarction and multiple arterial and venous thrombosis. The patient underwent urgent caesarean section and axillary-bifemoral bypass. No events registered. In the postoperative period, in an intensive care unit, treatment with rituximab and plasmapheresis were added to anticoagulant therapy. The laboratorial investigation was negative for thrombophilia and autoimmune diseases. Catastrophic APS develops quickly, with multiorgan involvement and high mortality rate. The presented case poses a multidisciplinary challenge, with the surgical approach of extra-anatomical revascularization being less invasive and guaranteeing immediate perfusion of the lower limbs. Although the serological tests were negative for anti-phospholipid antibodies, this case hardly fits into another diagnosis. Therefore, it was treated as a catastrophic APS, having shown a favorable evolution."

    "abstract": "Acute lower limb ischemia (ALI) is limb and life-threatening. The aim of this study was to explore the association between adherence to guidelines on clinical diagnosis of ALI and outcome at 1 year. The hypothesis was that that better examination was associated with favorable outcome in ALI patients. Retrospective cohort study between 2015 and 2018. In-hospital, operation, radiological and autopsy registries captured 161 citizens of Malmö with ALI. The initial bedside evaluation was performed by an emergency physician. Scoring was based on evaluation of the 6 \"Ps\" and 1 point was given for pain, pallor, pulselessness, perishing cold, paresthesia, paralysis or ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI). The performance was scored (range 0-7), and a score ≥5 was defined as a satisfactory vascular leg status. A multivariate logistic regression was performed to adjust for confounders and expressed in Odds Ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A satisfactory first clinical examination was performed in 55.3% of the patients. Measurement of ABI (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11-0.55), performing complete pulse status (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20-0.85), evaluating paralysis (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.20-0.89), and a bedside score ≥5 points (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.23-0.97) were independently associated with reduced risk of major amputation/mortality at 1-year follow up. Quality of initial bedside evaluation in patients with ALI was unsatisfactory to a large extent and better clinical examinations were associated with favorable outcome at 1 year. Skills in clinical diagnostics in ALI needs to be much improved."

    "abstract": "Following severe limb ischemia requiring urgent/emergent revascularization, peripheral arterial disease patients suffer a high risk of recurrent atherothrombosis. Patients discharged from Hamilton General Hospital (Hamilton, Ontario) between April 2016 and September 2017 following severe limb ischemia requiring urgent/emergent revascularization were identified via the Local Health Integration Network CorHealth database, with supplemental information from chart review. A total of 158 patients admitted for urgent/emergent revascularization were identified (148 alive at discharge). Among patients without a pre-existing indication for anticoagulation, 38.8% (n = 47) were discharged on single-antiplatelet therapy, 27.3% (n = 33) on dual-antiplatelet therapy, 19.8% (n = 24) on anticoagulants plus antiplatelet therapy, 6.6% (n = 8) on anticoagulants alone, and 2.6% (n = 3) on unknown therapy. Patients who received angioplasty with stenting were more likely be discharged on dual-antiplatelet therapy (hazard ratio [HR]: 7.14; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.87-17.76; P < 0.01); patients who received an embolectomy/thrombectomy were more likely be discharged on an anticoagulant alone (HR: 2.61; 95% CI: 1.00-6.81; P = 0.049); and patients who received peripheral bypass grafting were more likely be discharged on single-antiplatelet therapy (HR: 2.28; 95% CI: 1.11-4.69; P = 0.024). Neither statins (60.8% vs 56.3%; P = 0.23) nor renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (48.7% vs 50.6%; P = 0.58) were prescribed at higher rates at discharge, compared with the rate at admission. Substantial heterogeneity exists in antithrombotic prescription following urgent/emergent revascularization. No intensification of non-antithrombotic vascular protective medications occurred during hospitalization. Clinical trials and health system interventions to optimize medical therapy in peripheral arterial disease patients are urgently needed. Après une ischémie grave d’un membre ayant nécessité une revascularisation urgente/nouvelle revascularisation, les patients atteints d’une maladie artérielle périphérique ont un risque élevé de récidive d’athérothrombose. Nous avons recensé les patients qui ont obtenu leur sortie de la Hamilton General Hospital (Hamilton, Ontario) entre avril 2016 et septembre 2017 à la suite d’une ischémie grave d’un membre ayant nécessité une revascularisation urgente/nouvelle revascularisation via la base de données Local Health Integration Network CorHealth et grâce aux renseignements complémentaires issus de la revue des dossiers. Nous avons recensé un total de 158 patients admis pour une revascularisation urgente/nouvelle revascularisation (148 patients en vie à la sortie de l’hôpital). Parmi les patients chez lesquels l’anticoagulation n’avait pas antérieurement été indiquée, 38,8 % (n = 47) avaient reçu à leur sortie de l’hôpital un simple traitement antiplaquettaire; 27,3 % (n = 33), une bithérapie antiplaquettaire; 19,8 % (n = 24), des anticoagulants plus un traitement antiplaquettaire; 6,6 % (n = 8), des anticoagulants seuls; 2,6 % (n = 3), un traitement inconnu. Les patients qui avaient subi une angioplastie et une pose d’endoprothèse étaient plus susceptibles d’obtenir à leur sortie de l’hôpital une bithérapie antiplaquettaire (rapport de risque [RR] : 7,14; intervalle de confiance [IC] à 95 % : 2,87-17,76; P < 0,01); les patients qui avaient subi une embolectomie, ou thrombectomie, étaient plus susceptibles d’obtenir à leur sortie de l’hôpital un anticoagulant seul (RR : 2,61; IC à 95 % : 1,00-6,81; P = 0,049); les patients qui avaient subi un pontage périphérique étaient plus susceptibles d’obtenir à leur congé de l’hôpital un simple traitement antiplaquettaire (RR : 2,28; IC à 95 % : 1,11-4,69; P = 0,024). Comparativement à l’admission, ni les statines (60,8 % vs 56,3 %; P = 0,23) ni les inhibiteurs du système rénine–angiotensine–aldostérone (48,7 % vs 50,6 %; P = 0,58) n’avaient été prescrits à des taux plus élevés à la sortie de l’hôpital. Nous observons une hétérogénéité substantielle de l’ordonnance des antithrombotiques après la revascularisation urgente/nouvelle revascularisation. L’hospitalisation n’a donné lieu à aucune augmentation des médicaments de protection vasculaire non antithrombotiques. Des essais cliniques et des interventions du système de santé qui permettent d’optimiser le traitement médical des patients atteints d’une maladie artérielle sont d’une urgente nécessité."

A 49-year-old man presented to the emergency department with acute right limb ischemia (Rutherford IIB) nine days after his ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) vaccination. CT angiography revealed significant aortic thrombosis and right femoral artery occlusion. Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 23 × 103/µL), promptly elevated D-dimers (37937 ng/mL) and a reduced fibrinogen level (176 mg/dL) were remarkable. ELISA testing for anti-PF4 antibodies confirmed the diagnosis of VITT. An emergency revascularization of the right leg was provided via thrombectomy. High-dose intravenous immunoglobulins were administered whereafter the platelet count restored gradually. Therapeutic anticoagulation was progressively started. The postoperative course was uneventful and follow-up imaging after four weeks showed an almost complete resolution of the significant aortic thrombosis. Early recognition and appropriate counseling of VITT is advocated to pursue a good clinical outcome. Our patient presenting with severe aortic thrombosis and acute limb ischemia was successfully treated by a vascular thrombectomy along with intravenous immunoglobulins and anticoagulation therapy as the mainstay therapy."

    "abstract": "A Viabahn stent graft (SG) is a heparin-coated self-expandable SG for lower extremity arterial disease that exhibits high flexibility and accuracy in the delivery system. This study aimed to evaluate the short-term efficacy and safety of emergency endovascular treatment (EVT) using a Viabahn SG for upper and lower extremity arterial bleeding (ULEAB). Consecutive patients with ULEAB who underwent emergency EVT using the Viabahn SG between January 2017 and August 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. The indications for EVT, location of artery, technical success, clinical success, limb ischemia, periprocedural complications, bleeding-related mortality, 30-day mortality, diameter of the target artery, diameter of the SG, neck length, rebleeding, endoleaks, and patency of the SGs at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months were evaluated. EVT using the Viabahn SG was performed in 22 patients (mean age, 72.0 ± 13.0 years; 11 men) and 23 arteries (upper, 6; lower, 17). The indications for EVT were pseudoaneurysm (n = 13, 59.1%), extravasation (n = 9, 39.1%), and inadvertent arterial cannulation (n = 1, 4.3%). The anatomical locations of the 23 ULEAB injuries were the brachiocephalic (1 [4.3%]), subclavian (3 [13.0%]), axillary (1 [4.3%]), brachial (1 [4.3%]), common iliac (4 [17.4%]), external iliac (8 [34.8%]), common femoral (2 [8.7%]), superficial femoral (2 [8.7%]), and popliteal (1 [4.3%]) arteries. The technical and clinical success rates were 100%. The rates of limb ischemia, periprocedural complications, and bleeding-related mortality were 0%, whereas the 30-day mortality rate was 22.7%. The mean diameters of the arteries and SGs were 7.7 ± 2.2 and 8.9 ± 2.3 mm, respectively. The mean neck length was 20.4 ± 11.3 mm. No endoleaks or rebleeding occurred during the follow-up period (mean, 169 ± 177 days). Two SG occlusions without limb ischemia occurred in the external iliac and brachial arteries after 1 and 4 months, respectively. Subsequently, cumulative SG patency was confirmed after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months in 91.7%, 91.7%, 81.5%, and 81.5% of patients, respectively. Emergency EVT using the Viabahn SG for ULEAB was effective and safe according to short-term outcomes. Appropriate size selection and neck length are important for successful treatment. SG patency was good after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months."

    "abstract": "After extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), acute compartment syndrome (ACS) can develop because of limb ischemia or reperfusion. The standard treatment for ACS is emergency fasciotomy. We introduced an interrupted incision technique instead of a long double-incision to reduce blood loss and subsequent hypovolemia in ECMO patients. Two patients were treated venoarterial ECMO with heparinization by inserting cannulas into their right femoral vessels: Case #1 after emergency pulmonary thrombectomy for massive pulmonary thrombi and Case #2 after percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-elevation myocardial infarction with ventricular fibrillation. Some of the '5 P' signs of ACS were detected on their right legs. We treated them with the interrupted incision fasciotomy: four or five skin incisions of 2-3 cm each on lateral side; one 6-7 cm proximal skin incision with one or two separate short distal skin incisions of 1-1.5 cm each on the posteromedial side. The subcutaneous layer was also incised through these interrupted incisions; interrupted multiple \"soft tissue tunnels\" can be formed above muscle layer between the incisions. Once the fascia was exposed, the connected fasciotomy was performed with the knife blade facing subcutaneous layer, rather than muscle. The two patients' foot pulse, skin color, and muscle tone were immediately restored, and delayed primary wound closures were possible. Both patients were satisfied with their limb salvage and could walk with a little help using an orthosis or a cane. We recommend the interrupted incision fasciotomy as an attractive and effective technique for ACS, particularly after ECMO."

This study aims to describe the trends in hospitalizations for cardiovascular surgical emergencies in France, before, during and after the first lockdown. All adults admitted for mechanical complications of myocardial infarction (MI), aortic dissection, aortic aneurysm rupture, acute and critical limb ischemia, circulatory assistance, heart transplantation and major amputation were included. This retrospective cohort study used the French National Hospital Discharge database. The numbers of hospitalizations per month in 2020 were compared to the previous three years. From January to September 2020, 94,408 cases of the studied conditions were reported versus 103,126 in the same period in 2019 (-8.5%). There was a deep drop in most conditions during the lockdown, except for circulatory assistance, which increased. After the lockdown, mechanical complications of MI and aortic aneurysm rupture increased, and cardiac transplantations declined compared with previous years. We confirmed a deep drop in most cardiovascular surgical emergencies during the lockdown. The post-lockdown period was characterized by a small over-recovery for mechanical complications of MI and aortic aneurysm rupture, suggesting that many patients were able to access surgery after the lockdown."

Both surgical and percutaneous approach can be used for cannulation, but percutaneous approach has been associated with fewer complications. Angio-guided percutaneous cannulation and decannulation may further decrease the rate of complication. We aimed to compare outcome and complication rates in patients supported with V-A ECLS through percutaneous angio-guided versus surgical approach. We included all patients with emergent peripheral femoro-femoral V-A ECLS implantation for refractory cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest in our center from March 2018 to March 2021. Survival and major complications (major bleeding, limb ischemia and groin infection) rates were compared between the percutaneous angio-guided and the surgical groups. One hundred twenty patients received V-A ECLS, 59 through surgical approach and 61 through angio-guided percutaneous approach. Patients' baseline characteristics and severity scores were equally balanced between the 2 groups. Thirty-day mortality was not significantly different between the 2 approaches. However, angio-guided percutaneous cannulation was associated with fewer major vascular complications (42% vs. 11%, p > 0.0001) and a higher rate of V-A ECLS decannulation. In multivariate analysis, percutaneous angio-guided implantation of V-A ECLS was independently associated with a lower probability of major complications. Compared to surgical approach, angio-guided percutaneous V-A ECLS implantation is associated with fewer major vascular complications. Larger studies are needed to confirm those results and address their impact on mortality."

    "abstract": "Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is used to describe the constellation of symptoms arising from neurovascular compression of the thoracic outlet. The structures passing through the thoracic outlet include the subclavian artery, subclavian vein and trunks of the brachial plexus. Patients may experience symptoms related to compression of any one or various combinations of these structures. Arterial pathology as the cause of TOS is rare, though repetitive overhead arm motion, such as seen in athletes, is a risk factor for developing arterial TOS (aTOS). Symptoms include chronic findings, such as pallor, arm claudication or cool arm. Currently diagnosis of aTOS is made using clinical and imaging parameters which include focused history and physical including provocative maneuvers and imaging follow-up ranging from angiography to MRI. Occasionally, acute thrombosis can result in limb threatening ischemia requiring emergent catheter directed thrombolysis. Outside of acute limb ischemia, management of aTOS is variable, however typically begins with conservative measures such as physical therapy. In patients who do not respond or progress on conservative management, surgical decompression may be performed. Open or endovascular treatment of subclavian artery pathology may be necessary for recalcitrant cases. In this article, the aim is to review the elements involving diagnosis and management of aTOS."

Here we present a case of ALLI in the setting of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) while systematically reviewing the current literature to withdraw conclusions about the management, prognosis, and treatment for this atypical presentation of AL. Methods: We conducted a systematic electronic research according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis protocol (PRISMA) for articles published from January 1981 up to January 2021 concerning ALLI in the setting of acute leukemia (AL). Patients' baseline characteristics were recorded and nine outcomes of interest were studied. Results: Twenty-six individuals, 16 males with a mean age of 46.3 years (±20) were included in this review. The diagnosis included 13 AML patients (50%), 11 acute promyelotic leukemia (APL) (42.3%) and two acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) (7.7%). Treatment varied among nine different regimens. Four patients were treated with chemotherapy alone (15.4%), four with thrombectomy alone (15.4%), and 11 with a combination of chemotherapy and thrombectomy (42.3%). Eight major amputations were recorded (30. 8%). Thirty-day mortality was 35.7%. Forty-eight peripheral thrombotic events were recorded with 12 patients suffering recurrent thrombotic events. Conclusion: ALLI as the presenting symptom of AL is a rare condition that carries significant mortality and amputation rates. Timely diagnosis is crucial concerning short-term survival and limb salvage. APL, despite being the rarest form of AL, represented a significant proportion of the patient population in this review. The role of leukostasis in the disease's progression and the efficacy of leukapheresis as a treatment regimen should be further investigated through case-control studies."

    "abstract": "Background: Acute lower limb ischemia with a motor deficit (Rutherford IIb) needs urgent revascularization to avoid major amputation and mortality. It is unclear whether immediate revascularization without performing CT angiography (CTA) prior to revascularization in Rutherford IIb acute lower limb ischemia (ALI) is associated with better outcomes. Methods: Retrospective observational study of Rutherford IIb ALI patients treated between 2006 and 2018. A propensity score adjusted analysis was performed to compare outcomes after the performance of CTA examination or not. Results: Among 681 patients, 260 had Rutherford IIb ALI. CTA prior to revascularization was performed in 131 (50.4%) and increased (p < 0.001) throughout the study period. Open vascular and endovascular surgery was first performed in 147 (56.5%) and 113 (43.5%) patients, respectively. The proportion of endovascular treatment increased while the open vascular surgery decreased during the study period (p = 0.031). In the propensity score adjusted analysis, the performance of CTA was associated with decreased risk of combined major amputation /mortality (odds ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.27-0.99; p = 0.046) at 1 year. Conclusion: Performance of CTA was associated with a higher amputation-free survival in revascularized patients with Rutherford IIb ALI. CTA seem to provide guidance in selecting the most appropriate candidates for revascularization and choice of technique."

For this reason, their bites are often erroneously treated in the field with the application of a tourniquet in the hope of delaying systemic spread of the venom. Observational studies have shown that inappropriate tourniquet application is a common, harmful practice. An arterial tourniquet is not a recommended first aid measure because of the risk of limb ischemia and gangrene. When inappropriately applied, the rapid removal of the tourniquet in the emergency department may precipitate a life-threatening venom and metabolic toxin rush, leading to respiratory arrest. We present two cases of black mamba bites in Gauteng, South Africa, where gradual tourniquet removal was used to avoid a venom rush and rapid respiratory paralysis. Venom and metabolic toxin rush with potentially fatal respiratory muscle paralysis may be averted by gradual, cautious removal of field-applied tourniquets with concomitant antivenom administration."

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Coagulopathy is frequently found in severe cases of COVID-19 and is usually manifested as a prothrombotic state. Hyperinflammation, endotheliitis, and immobilization during illness are hypothesized to play a role. Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is one of the presentations of arterial thrombosis in COVID-19. We present two cases of middle-aged men with COVID-19 infection, who developed ALI. The first patient developed ALI after 16 days from the initial COVID-19 diagnosis, and the second patient was admitted to the emergency ward due to sudden discoloration of his right lower limb, and COVID-19 was diagnosed during the evaluation."

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been widely reported to be associated with increased risk of Venous Thromboembolism, both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism. A rare and extreme manifestation of DVT is Phlegmasia cerulea dolens, characterized by poor tissue perfusion due to marked limb swelling which can progress to limb and life-threatening venous gangrene. We report the case of a 53-year-old man with severe SARS-CoV2 pneumonia who developed acute iliofemoral DVT leading to acute limb ischemia due to Phlegmasia cerulea dolens. The patient underwent successful emergent fasciotomy and mechanical thrombectomy with removal of extensive thrombus burden and restoration of normal venous circulation. Our case highlights the importance of clinical vigilance and early implementation of therapeutic interventions to avoid adverse outcomes in patients who develop SARS-CoV2 induced Venous Thromboembolism complications."

    "title": "Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio Could Predict Outcome in Patients Presenting with Acute Limb Ischemia.",
    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia (ALI), classified according to Rutherford's classification (RC), is a vascular emergency burdened by high rates of mortality and morbidity. The need of new and different prognostic values for ALI has emerged, and, among all, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been proven as a strong outcome predictor in vascular disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of preoperative NLR in predicting clinical outcomes in patients presenting acute limb ischemia. A single-center retrospective study was conducted between January 2015 and December 2019. Demographic and clinical characteristics, procedural technical aspects, postoperative and early (up to 30-day) outcomes were recorded. All enrolled patients were categorized into low- and high-NLR at baseline, using a cut-off value of 5. Study outcomes were 30-day all-cause mortality and amputation rates. A total of 177 ALI patients were included in the final analysis (6 RC I, 44 RC IIA, 108 RC IIB, and 19 RC III), 115 males (65%), mean age 78.9 ± 10.4 years. Mean NLR at hospital presentation was 6.65 ± 6.75 (range 0.5-35.4), 108 (61.1%) patients presented a low-NLR, 69 (38.9%) a high-NLR. Immediate technical success was achieved in 90.1% of cases. At 30 days, freedom from amputation and freedom from death rates were 87.1% and 83.6%, respectively. At the univariate analysis, amputation (p < 0.0001, OR: 9.65, 95%CI: 3.7-25.19), mortality (p = 0.0001, OR: 9.88, 95%CI: 3.19-30.57), and cumulative event rates (p < 0.001, OR: 14.45, 95%CI: 6.1-34.21), were significantly different between the two groups according to NLR value. Multivariate analysis showed that a high baseline NLR value was an independent predictor of unfavorable outcomes in all enrolled patients. Consistently, at ROC analysis, a preoperative NLR > 5 was strongly associated with all outcome occurrences. Preoperative NLR value seems to be strongly related to ALI outcomes in this unselected population. The largest series should be evaluated to confirm present results."

    "abstract": "Cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest are life-threatening emergencies with high mortality rates. Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) and extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (e-CPR) provide viable options for life sustaining measures when medical therapy fails. The purpose of this study is to determine the utilization and outcomes of VA ECMO and eCPR in patients that require emergent cardiac support at a single academic center. A retrospective chart review of prospectively collected data was performed at an academic institution from January 1st, 2018 to June 30th, 2020. All consecutive patients who required VA ECMO were evaluated based on whether they underwent traditional VA ECMO or eCPR. The study variables include demographic data, duration on ECMO, length of stay, complications, and survival to discharge. A total of 90 patients were placed on VA ECMO for cardiac support with 44.4% (40) of these patients undergoing eCPR secondary to cardiac arrest and emergent placement on ECMO. A majority of the patients were male (n = 64, 71.1%) and the mean age was 58.8 ± 15.8 years. 44.4% of patients were transferred from outside hospitals for a higher level of care and 37.8% of patients required another primary therapy such as an Impella or IABP. The most common complication experienced by patients was bleeding (n = 41, 45.6%), which occurred less often in eCPR (n = 29, 58% vs. n = 12, 30%). Other complications included infections (n = 11, 12.2%), limb ischemia (n = 13, 14.4%), acute kidney injury (n = 17, 18.9%), and cerebral vascular accident (n = 4, 4.4%). The length of stay was longer for patients on VA ECMO (32.1 ± 40.7 days vs. 17.7 ± 18.2 days). Mean time on ECMO was 8.1 ± 8.3 days. Survival to discharge was higher in VA ECMO patients (n = 23, 46% vs. n = 8, 20%). VA ECMO provided an effective rescue therapy in patients in acute cardiogenic shock with a survival greater than the expected ELSO guidelines of 40%. While the survival of eCPR was lower than expected, this may reflect the severity of patient's condition and emphasizes the importance of careful patient selection and planning."

We present the case of a 54-year-old male patient. polytrauma patient who underwent internal iliac artery embolization leading to extensive gluteal necrosis requiring: debridement, abdominoperineal resection and composite anterolateral thigh flap reconstruction with prolonged lithotomy position. The patient presented lower limb ischemia briefly after surgical theater. A computed tomography scan revealed the obstruction of the left superficial femoral artery requiring emergency revascularization. Arterial thrombosis is a potentially devastating complication and plastic surgeons should be aware of the possible dangers when performing surgeries in prolonged lithotomy position. Preoperative detection of patients at high risks for developing complications should be performed in order to implement preventive measures and avoid potentially life-threatening sequelae."

    "abstract": "Aortoiliac occlusion disease, also called Leriche syndrome, is characterized by atherothrombotic obliteration of the aortic bifurcation and bilateral common iliac arteries; typically, it has a chronic presentation. Pulmonary embolism is more related to venous thromboembolism rather than arterial thromboembolic events. Therefore, cases of simultaneous acute Leriche syndrome and pulmonary embolism are rare. Existing intracardiac right-to-left shunt were detected in most previous cases. Herein, we present the first likely documented case wherein acute Leriche syndrome and pulmonary embolism occurred simultaneously without a patent foramen ovale. A 58-year-old man with hyperlipidemia and coronary artery disease presented with a 4-h history of bilateral lower limb numbness. He was a heavy smoker with a history of stroke. Computed tomography angiography revealed pulmonary embolism and aortoiliac artery occlusion. Although a massive thrombus straddled the bilateral pulmonary arteries, orthopnea was his only presentation, without right ventricle failure. Cyanosis of the affected limbs was noted, and muscle strength in both limbs had regressed to grade 1. Owing to acute limb ischemia, he underwent an emergency operation to salvage the limbs. On postoperative day 5, the general condition of both the legs improved; the muscle strength improved to grade 4. He was then transferred to the general ward and enoxaparin was continued. Computed tomography angiography was repeated to evaluate the pulmonary embolism on postoperative day 8; the thrombus remained lodged in the bilateral main pulmonary arteries. Owing to persistent orthopnea and chest tightness with intermittent tachycardia, he underwent a staged operation for the pulmonary embolism on postoperative day 13. During the surgery, intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography showed no patent foramen ovale or an existing right-to-left shunt. Postoperatively, he was closely monitored in the intensive care unit for 3 days and then transferred to the general ward for 10 days. A final computed tomography angiography performed on postoperative day 18 revealed thrombus resolution. He was then discharged on postoperative day 30 without any in-hospital complications. We present a case that might be the first documented report of acute Leriche syndrome co-occurring with pulmonary embolism without an existing patent foramen ovale."

This study describes the change in vascular surgery services across Australia and New Zealand before and during the COVID-19 restrictions. De-identified data from the Australia and New Zealand Society for Vascular Surgery Australasian Vascular Audit from January 2015 to September 2020 was obtained. Vascular surgery procedure numbers from January to September of 2020 (study period) was compared to the corresponding months between 2015 and 2019 (pre-study period). The volume of procedures, both elective and emergency, were compared. Subgroup analyses included procedures categorized by operation type and location. There was a 11% decrease in total vascular procedures, 22% decrease in elective procedures, and a 14% increase in emergency procedures, comparing the study and pre-study periods. There was a large increase in all revascularization procedures for critical limb ischemia and no change in acute limb ischemia interventions, without a concomitant rise in major or minor all-cause amputation. There was a decrease in interventions for abdominal aortic aneurysm and carotid artery disease, driven by a fall in elective procedures, while volume for dialysis access remained the same. Change in procedural volume varied by state with the largest decrease noted in NSW and Victoria. The COVID-19 pandemic reduced vascular surgery procedures across Australia and New Zealand with a decrease in elective operations and an increase in emergency operations."

    "abstract": "Diabetes and peripheral vascular diseases are accompanied frequently by lower limb ischemia and in minority, need for amputation, as a treatment of last resort. Even after a decision has been made regarding amputation, the procedures are often repeatedly postponed due to more urgent surgeries and lack of operating room availability. This study assessed the possible relationship between the duration of time inpatients wait for semiurgent amputations and the incidence of postamputation complications. A retrospective cohort, including all 360 adult patients who underwent nontraumatic limb amputation due to an ischemic/gangrenous/infected foot in a single center during an 11-year period (2007-2017). Most (96%) of the procedures were major amputations. The mean waiting time until amputation was 3 ± 5 days. Mortality during hospitalization occurred in 101 (28%) patients and re-amputation in 38 (11%). The duration of antibiotic treatment was 11 ± 14 days. The rate of sepsis was 30% (107/360). There was no significant difference between the duration of time until amputation and mortality during hospitalization: among those who waited ≤48 hours, the mortality rate was 27% (60/224) and among those who waited >48 hours 30% (41/136) (p = .5). Patients waiting ≤48 hours had higher re-amputation rates than those waiting >48 (31/223 (14%) vs 7/136 (5%), p = .009). Mortality was associated significantly to patients' age and renal function. Correlation was found between the waiting time until amputation (≤48 or >48 hours) and the rates of in-hospital mortality, sepsis, duration of antibiotic treatment and overall duration of hospitalization. Re-amputation rate was higher in group with the shorter waiting time. This correlation may be explained by the fact that patients who needed urgent amputation had a more extensive and severe disease, and thus tended to require more re-amputation operations."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is a surgical emergency that generally develops in the outpatient setting. Hospitalized patients are also at risk for acute limb ischemia, but their presentation may be atypical or altered by medical therapy. Our institution developed an alert system to facilitate the prompt recognition and treatment of ALI that occurs in the inpatient population. We aimed to evaluate the usage of the system after the first 2 years of operation. All ALI alerts from October 2017 to December 2019 were collected from paging records and analyzed for location, timing, and the need for intervention. Alerts undergoing vascular intervention were classified as urgent (within 8 hours) or delayed (after 8 hr). Time and location data were evaluated to determine patterns of usage and true-positive rate of the system. From October 2017 to December 2019, there were 237 ALI alerts obtained from paging records containing time and location information for the alert. More alerts originated from ICUs relative to non-ICU floors (68% vs. 33%, P< 0.001), however a greater proportion of non-ICU floor alerts required intervention compared to ICU alerts (32.0% vs. 5.1%, P < .0001). The highest number of ALI alerts were from the Medical ICU (MRICU) (45.9%) and medical/surgical floors (33.3%), followed by Surgical ICU (20.2%). Alerts were more common within 3 hr of morning and evening nursing shift changes (47.3%, P < 0.001). From the 237 total alerts, the patient was able to be identified retrospectively in 186 cases, and of these 27 resulted in operative interventions (14.5%, positive predictive value), with 11 patients (40.7%) requiring urgent intervention with a median time to intervention of 3.5 hr (range 2.2-4.8), and 16 (59%) alerts undergoing a delayed intervention at a mean of 3 days (range 2-4). A total of 73 (39.2%) alert patients died during their admission, of which 65 (89.0%) were in an ICU, and no deaths were directly related to ALI. The median time to death was 2 days (range 0-95 days), and in 22 cases death occurred <24 hr from time of alert. Our novel hospital-wide ALI alert system demonstrates a 14.5% positive predictive value for ischemia that resulted in an intervention. Alerts were more likely to originate from the ICU setting and during nursing shift changes. Alerts originating from non-ICU floors were 5 times more likely to undergo surgical intervention for ALI. Further analysis is required to assess the effect of this system on patient safety, outcome, and allocation of institutional resources."

    "abstract": "A 64-year-old man with a history of a 5.5-centimeter (cm) abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of severe back pain after climbing over a fence and falling a distance of eight feet. Prior to arrival, the prehospital paramedics reported that the patient did not have palpable pulses in either lower extremity. The initial physical examination in the ED was significant for absent dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally as well as absent posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally and cold, insensate lower extremities. Point-of-care ultrasound identified an approximate 7-cm infrarenal AAA with a mural thrombus present. After receiving several computed tomography (CT) studies including CT head without contrast and CT angiography of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, the patient was diagnosed with acute thrombosis of AAA and associated thromboembolic occlusion of both his right and left distal iliac vessels causing bilateral acute limb ischemia. He immediately received unfractionated heparin and was admitted to the hospital for embolectomy and intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator. Acute thrombosis of AAA and subsequent thromboembolic events are a rare but significant complication that can occur in patients with a history of AAA. Thromboembolic events may occur spontaneously or in the setting of blunt abdominal trauma. Common presenting signs and symptoms include distal limb ischemia and absent femoral pulses. Timely management and recognition of this rare complication is vital as this condition can ultimately result in limb loss or death if not treated in a timely manner. Heparinization after confirmation of non-ruptured AAA as well as vascular surgery, and therapeutic and vascular interventional radiology consultations are key steps that should be taken to decrease patient morbidity and mortality."

In this observational, retrospective, single-center cohort study, we describe the impact of COVID-19 pandemic containment strategies on patients with lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) referred during the period March 11, to May 11, 2020, compared to the same time frames in 2018 to 2019. Patients admitted for acute limb ischemia (ALI) or chronic PAD and undergoing urgent or elective vascular surgery or primary amputation were included. Patients' characteristics, indications for admission, and surgical features were analyzed. The occurrence of 30 day outcomes was assessed, including length of stay, rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and major adverse limb events (MALE), and procedural and hemodynamic success. Overall, 166 patients were included. Fewer subjects per 10 day period were operated in 2020 compared to, 2018 to 2019 (6.7 vs. 10.5, respectively; P < 0.001). The former had higher rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (25% vs. 11.1%; P = 0.029), and ASA score (3.13 vs. 2.90; P = 0.015). The percentage of patients with ALI in 2020 was about double that of the same period in 2018 to 2019 (47.5% vs. 24.6%; P = 0.006). Overall, the types of surgery were similar between 2020 and 2018 to 2019, while palliative care and primary amputations occurred only in 2020 (5 out 40 cases). The rate of post-operative MACE was significantly higher in 2020 (10% vs. 2.4%; P = 0.037). During the first state of emergency for COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, less regular medical follow-up and hindered hospital access could have resulted in more acute and advanced clinical presentations of patients with PAD undergoing surgery. Guidelines are needed to provide appropriate care to this vulnerable population and avoid a large-scale disaster."

    "abstract": "Endovascular treatment is prevalent as a primary treatment for coronary and peripheral arterial diseases. Although the introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES) dramatically reduced the risk of in-stent restenosis, stent thrombosis persists as an issue. Notwithstanding improvements in newer generation DES, they are yet to address the urgent clinical need to abolish the late stent complications that result from in-stent restenosis and are associated with late thrombus formation. These often lead to acute coronary syndromes with high mortality in coronary artery disease and acute limb ischemia with a high risk of limb amputation in peripheral arterial disease. Recently, a significant amount of research has focused on alternative solutions to improve stent biocompatibility by using tissue engineering. There are two types of tissue engineering endothelialisation methods: in vitro and in vivo. To date, commercially available in vivo endothelialised stents have failed to demonstrate antithrombotic or anti-stenosis efficacy in clinical trials. In contrast, the in vitro endothelialisation methods exhibit the advantage of monitoring cell type and growth prior to implantation, enabling better quality control. The present review discusses tissue-engineered candidate stents constructed by distinct in vitro endothelialisation approaches, with a particular focus on fabrication processes, including cell source selection, stent material composition, stent surface modifications, efficacy and safety evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies, and future directions."

    "abstract": "Acute Limb Ischemia (ALI) carries a high morbidity and mortality rate that is compounded in the cancer patient. Though it is a relatively uncommon event, it is of extremely high adverse impact and carries poor awareness among clinicians. Retrospective review of electronic medical records was performed of cancer patients presenting with acute limb ischemia (ALI) to the tertiary cancer center's urgent care center or as inpatient between January 1, 2014 and January 1, 2020. Out of the 29 cancer patients with ALI, 12 (41%) died within 3 month and 9 (31%) patients died within 1 months of ALI diagnosis. 65% had long term adverse outcome after ALI - 31% with death in 1 month, 2 (7%) with an amputation, 5 (17%) with lifestyle-limiting claudication, and 3 (10%) with subsequent wound ulceration or gangrene. Patients not eligible for standard of care (12 patients, 41%) (RR 2.33 95% CI [1.27-4.27], p <  0.01) and heparin administration ≥6 h from presentation (19 patients, 65%) (RR 2.81 [1.07-7.38], p = 0.04) were at increased risk of adverse outcome.

The patient was quickly diagnosed with PCD affecting the left lower extremity, which quickly resolved after administration of heparin infusion for one hour, despite the degree of limb ischemia. There is no consensus for the treatment of this condition. The most interesting feature of this case is the prompt resolution of symptoms with short-term administration of anticoagulation with total resolution without the need for thrombolysis or thrombectomy. This may suggest that prompt pharmacologic treatment in patients eligible for anticoagulation may successfully restore venous flow negating the need for further intervention."

Individuals can have an immune-mediated reaction to heparin products which results in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has added to the difficulty of treating patients with ALI due to increasing the likelihood of HIT via the virus's ability to manipulate the coagulation parameters. We present a case of ALI complicated by HIT in a 49-year-old male with a confirmed asymptomatic COVID-19. The patient initially presented with progressive pain, coldness, and tingling in the right foot. He was treated with a tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) and a heparin drip. The occlusion persisted despite medical intervention leading to right below-knee amputation.

Herein, we report the successful treatment of BAAI via endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) performed immediately after emergency laparotomy to repair a bowel injury. A 78-year-old man was injured after being caught between a shovel car and the bumper of his own car for approximately 15 s. Upon arrival at the hospital, the patient was conscious and had stable vital signs, abdominal and low back pain, and numbness in the right lower limb. Computed tomography revealed contrast medium leakage into the mesentery, as well as aortic dissection and rupture. Hemostasis and intestinal resection were completed, and EVAR was performed immediately after abdominal closure. The patient was discharged from the hospital at 35 days after surgery. In this case, there existed a risk of artificial blood vessel infection if reconstruction was simultaneously performed with intestinal resection. Symptoms of lower limb ischemia that were observed prior to surgery resolved. After open surgery, bleeding was controlled, and the patient's vital signs were stable. EVAR was performed as treatment for aortic injury, thereby reducing the risk of direct implant infection and enabling minimally invasive treatment. EVAR may be useful for the treatment of BAAI in the presence of intestinal injuries, reduce the risk of implant infection, and allow for a one-time, minimally invasive treatment."

This retrospective cohort study collected the clinical data from 124 patients (128 affected lower limbs) with ALI who underwent emergency surgery from March 2010 to November 2019. Patients were consecutively divided into Group A and Group B. Patients in Group A underwent simple arterial thrombectomy via the Fogarty catheterization. Patients in Group B underwent arterial thrombectomy, and the DSA was performed during the surgery. The differences in the success rate of primary surgery, the second intervention rate, and the amputation/mortality rate within 30-days after surgery were compared. In Group A, 4 of 70 limbs (5.7%) were amputated, 54 of 70 limbs (77.1%) had improved blood flow, 14 of 70 limbs (20.0%) received a second intervention, and 3 of 68 patients (4.4%) died within 30 days. In Group B, 1 of 58 limbs (1.7%) was amputated, 56 of 58 limbs (96.6%) had improved blood flow, 3 of 58 limbs (5.2%) received a second intervention, and 2 of 56 patients (3.5%) died within 30-days. The success rate of primary surgery, the second intervention rate, and the amputation rate of Group B were significantly lower than Group A (P < 0.05). Arterial thrombectomy combined with DSA may effectively improve the clinical efficacy of patients with ALI."

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has rapidly spread worldwide, is now a public health emergency, and has been declared a pandemic. While SARS-CoV-2 is known to cause significant pulmonary disease, ranging from pneumonia to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), various extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 have also been reported. Growing evidence suggests that COVID-19 leads to a hypercoagulable state leading to micro and macro-vascular angiopathies. We present a case of an 80-year-old male without a previous history of prothrombotic disorders who developed descending aortic thrombosis, approximately 40% stenosis, at the level of the diaphragmatic hiatus and acute limb ischemia secondary to COVID-19 requiring emergent surgical intervention. After 12 days of persistent ischemic left lower extremity imaging despite thrombectomy, bypass, and therapeutic heparin, the patient's limb was deemed non-salvageable and underwent left above-knee amputation. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular function, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and no evidence of atrial septal defect, aortic root abnormalities, or intraventricular thrombi. Evaluation of autoimmune and inflammatory vasculitis was negative. While further study into the prothrombotic nature of this condition still needs to be pursued, the thromboembolic risk of COVID-19 represents an urgent need for appropriate anticoagulation for venous thrombosis. Arterial thrombosis requires other kinds of management to avoid the severe adverse effects of emboli and related ischemia. This current case highlights the need for randomized control trials testing different prophylactic strategies. Further evidence is also required for the role of amputation surgery when initial interventions for revascularization fail to restore blood flow."

    "abstract": "Acute upper limb ischemia is considered a vascular emergency. These events are mostly thromboembolic and are often detected in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Surgical thrombectomy and percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy are the usual methods to treat this medical emergency. In this case, we report the case of a 75-years old woman with a history of AF who initially presented to our center because of syncope resulting from Torsades de pointes due to a known long-QT syndrome. Those episodes were treated adequately from the implanted ICD. In addition to the symptoms of syncope, the patient also noted symptoms of right upper-limb ischemia. Using duplex sonography, we noticed a thrombotic occlusion at the level of the axillary artery. Using femoral access, we performed an antegrade angiography of the axillary artery, which confirmed a fresh thrombotic occlusion. The initially performed thrombus aspiration wasn't successful, and the decision was made to use an ekosonic endovascular system (Ekosonic ™ Endovascular System, Boston Scientific, EKOS) catheter to perform catheter-directed thrombolysis. Locally, 10 mg Actilyse were administrated. Then an EKOS Catheter was delivered to the occlusion area and was placed for 6 h. Symptoms of ischemia were resolved, and the angiographic control showed normal flow in the axillary artery. The patient was discharged without any local deficits of the right hand."

A 36-year-old male patient was admitted with chronic limb threatening ischemia of the left lower limb. The duplex ultrasound and computer tomography angiography (CTA) demonstrated a fusiform popliteal artery aneurism with a maximal diameter of 14 mm and distal occlusion of peroneal and both tibial arteries. Urgent hybrid intervention was performed, starting with an open thrombectomy from the distal posterior tibial artery via a retromalleolar access followed by percutaneous deployment of the DLM Roadsaver® stent (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) for the exclusion of the popliteal artery aneurism. The flow diverting effect was observed immediately with contrast stagnation in the asymmetrical part of the aneurism sac (grade C2 of the O'Kelly-Marotta flow diversion scale). The procedure was uneventful, with the regaining of an adequate foot perfusion and palpable pulse at the posterior tibial artery. On the 2nd postoperative day, the patient was diagnosed with a symptomatic form of COVID-19 infection and transferred to a dedicated facility. At a one-month follow-up, the patient had no symptoms of limb ischemia and CTA showed complete thrombosis of the aneurism sac, absence of endoleaks, and patency of the treated arterial segment. This case demonstrates the possibility of off-label use of the DLM Roadsaver® stent for hybrid treatment of popliteal artery aneurism complicated by distal embolization and critical limb ischemia."

Continual identification of foreign bodies on trauma imaging is of the utmost importance. Identifying and treating this rare entity can help vascular interventionalists improve patient outcomes. Our patient presented to the emergency room after sustaining 2 gunshot wounds to the right axilla. Initial imaging demonstrated 2 bullet fragments: one in the right axilla and another in the lower chest overlying the heart. A subsequent trauma computed tomography was performed 13 minutes later and demonstrated a bullet fragment in the left common iliac vein, which had embolized from the original location in the lower chest. Interventional radiology was consulted to perform foreign body removal. A transcutaneous approach was utilized, and the bullet embolus was removed successfully without complication. Bullet fragment embolization is a rare entity with complications ranging from critical limb ischemia to venous thrombosis or obstruction. This case helps to demonstrate the importance of identifying and accounting for bullet fragments in gunshot trauma imaging."

    "abstract": "Since the coronavirus pandemic set in in Spain in March 2020, a noteworthy increase in the incidence of acute limb ischemia (ALI) has been observed. It has been recently discovered that SARS-CoV 2 may lead to ALI secondary to arterial thrombosis. Elevation of D-dimer (DD) in patients with coronavirus infection (COVID-19) indicates that a hypercoagulable state causes acute arterial thrombosis. A remarkably high DD elevation has been reported to be a poor prognosis factor in COVID-19. The ways in which SARS-CoV 2 results in arterial thrombosis may be multiple. On the other hand, surgical revascularization for ALI is associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients, probably in relation to hypercoagulability. Here, we describe two ALI cases in patients who required urgent surgical treatment for limb salvage and were positive for the novel coronavirus infection (COVID 19). Desde que a pandemia pelo novo coronavírus se estabeleceu na Espanha, em março de 2020, um aumento notável da incidência de isquemia aguda de membros foi observado. Recentemente, descobriu-se que o coronavírus 2 causador da síndrome respiratória aguda grave (SARS-CoV-2) pode ocasionar isquemia aguda de membros secundária à trombose arterial. A elevação do D-dímero em pacientes acometidos pela doença do novo coronavírus (COVID-19) indica o estado de hipercoagulabilidade como causa da trombose arterial aguda. Vale destacar que a alta elevação do D-dímero foi relatada como um fator de prognóstico reservado na COVID-19. Há diversas maneiras pelas quais o SARS-CoV-2 pode resultar em trombose arterial. Em pacientes com COVID-19, a revascularização cirúrgica para isquemia aguda de membros está associada a desfechos desfavoráveis, provavelmente relacionados a hipercoagulabilidade. Descrevemos dois casos de isquemia aguda de membros de pacientes que necessitaram de tratamento cirúrgico de urgência para salvamento de membro e que haviam testado positivo para COVID-19."

Arterial Duplex ultrasound identified femoropopliteal occlusion, with popliteal refilling below the knee and a patent peroneal artery. An endovascular procedure was performed, requiring retrograde access to the popliteal artery to re-establish blood flow and deploy a popliteal stent. Technical success was achieved and the patient underwent debridement of the wound. Two days later, about 48 hours after the operation, the patient began to exhibit respiratory symptoms, with coughing and dyspnea. He immediately underwent a chest CT that identified ground glass opacities, the crazy-paving pattern, and bilateral air bronchogram in the lungs. A reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was positive for SARS-Cov-2. The patient was moved to an intensive care unit and put on mechanical ventilation. Both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were administered. Despite appropriate treatment, the patient died 4 days after he was diagnosed with COVID-19.

In the best of our knowledge there are no cases of sudden graft occlusion after such long time, described in literature. Patient presented with sudden pain and pallor in the right lower limb and subsequently same symptoms to the left lower limb. One year before she underwent an emergency repair for abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture with an aortobiliac graft. Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) scan showed a complete occlusion of the infrarenal aorta, including aortoiliac graft, to the common bilateral iliac arteries. On the right side was also found a complete occlusion of the popliteal artery.Emergent embolectomy of the right popliteal artery via the femoral artery was performed. CTA scan performed on third post-operative day showed the patency of infrarenal aorta and aortic portion of the grafts in presence of floating thrombus, right iliac branch patency and chronic occlusion of left iliac branch. A kinking of both graft iliac branches was evident after this CTA scan. CTA scan at one month demonstrated resolution of the thrombosis of the infrarenal aorta, complete patency of aortic portion of the graft and right iliac branch and chronic obstruction of the left common iliac artery. Acute limb ischemia caused by sudden graft occlusion one year later an aortic repair for acute abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture is a very rare event. Graft limbs kinking could explain acute thrombosis of the graft."

    "abstract": "Acute abdominal aortic occlusion (AAO) is a rare vascular emergency associated with high morbidity and mortality. In the present study, we analyzed the clinical management and outcomes for a consecutive patient series during a 16-year period. We included all patients with an acute AAO and bilateral acute limb ischemia who had been treated between 2004 and 2019. Patients with dissection, aneurysm rupture, or chronic occlusive disease were excluded. The patient characteristics, surgical procedures, and outcomes were extracted retrospectively from a prospective aortic database, electronic patient files, and outpatient examination records. The extent of ischemia was classified according to the TASC II (Inter-Society Consensus for the Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease) section on acute limb ischemia. The primary endpoints were 30-day mortality (safety endpoint) and the combined 6-month amputation and/or death rate (efficacy endpoint). The follow-up outcomes, amputation rates, and 30-day complications were evaluated as secondary endpoints. The patient cohort was divided into four 4-year groups (2004-2007, 2008-2011, 2012-2015, 2016-2019) to assess the outcome changes over time. Statistical analysis included χ2 tests and univariate and linear regression analyses. A total of 74 patients (57% male; median age, 64.5 years) with an acute AAO were identified. Arterial thrombosis was the most common etiology (66%). The extent of ischemia was TASC I, IIa, IIb, and III in 7%, 39%, 40%, and 14%, respectively. The patient numbers had increased significantly over time (P = .016). Of the patients, 42% had undergone open transfemoral recanalization (including hybrid procedures), 35% open aortic surgery, 15% extra-anatomic bypass surgery, and 5% (four patients) endovascular therapy alone. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 23%, and the 6-month amputation and/or death rate was 43%. The 30-day mortality rate had declined significantly from 54% for 2004 to 2007 to 10% for 2011 to 2015 (odds ratio [OR], 0.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.001-0.52) and 20% for 2016 to 2019 (OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.05-0.90), a statistically nonsignificant trend showing that the relative decline in the use of open aortic procedures was associated with decreased 30-day mortality (P = .06). Univariate analysis indicated that elevated serum lactate on admission (OR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.06-10.48) and an advanced stage of limb ischemia (OR, 4.33), were strongly associated with an increased 30-day mortality rate. The incidence of severe postoperative systemic complications also indicated a greater incidence of both primary endpoints. The 6-month amputation and/or mortality rates were also affected by the presence of atrial fibrillation (OR, 3.63; 95% CI, 1.34-9.79) and increased patient age (OR, 3.96; 95% CI, 1.49-10.53). Acute AAO remains a life-threatening emergency. Immediate transfemoral open or endovascular techniques should be preferred, if technically possible and proper intraoperative imaging is available."

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial embolism from malignant disease is uncommon and a rare cause of limb ischemia. In the acute setting, patients can present with severe ischemia of either the upper or lower limb, and urgent surgical intervention is often required to avoid severe debilitation and limb loss. Our case series comprised three patients who presented with upper and lower limb ischemia and were found to have concomitant malignancy. All three patients were female, with a median age of 54.3 years, and none of the patients was on active chemotherapy. One presented with stage IIb uterine carcinoma, one with stage IIIb ovarian carcinoma, and the other with stage IIIb cervical carcinoma. These patients were referred for vascular management, with two being acute and the other acute on chronic. Of the three patients, two presented with acute limb ischemia and underwent arterial thrombectomy, one of the upper and the other the lower limb. The third patient, with acute-on-chronic upper limb ischemia, was treated conservatively with intravenous heparin followed by oral anticoagulation. All three had limb salvage and survival outcome at 1 year post-treatment. In this small series, surgical intervention in two patients and conservative management in the other patient led to limb salvage with a reasonably good quality of life. Even though the long-term survival for patients with malignant disease is generally poor, surgical intervention can achieve limb salvage with a reasonably good quality of life."

However, they are associated with an extremely high morbidity including limb loss and asymmetric limb growth. 11 year old previously healthy female who presented to a pediatric emergency department immediately after sustaining blunt trauma to her abdomen by a bicycle handlebar. She complained of pain in her right lower extremity without paresthesia and was noted to have a painful superficial laceration to the right lower abdomen with tenderness on palpation. The extremity was noted to be mottled, cool to touch, with decreased sensations and delayed capillary refill but intact motor function. The peripheral pulses in the extremity were noted to be absent on exam, which was confirmed by a bedside Doppler. A Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) of the abdomen and pelvis revealed an occluding thrombus in the external iliac and right common femoral arteries which required surgical repair. She subsequently developed occlusion secondary to traumatic dissection and compartment syndrome in the same extremity requiring repeat surgical intervention. In managing patients with blunt force trauma to the abdomen from handlebars, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for vascular injuries even with low-risk mechanism of injury and superficial injuries noted on exam. Their assessment should include immediate examination of bilateral peripheral pulses of the lower extremities to evaluate for clinical findings associated with acute lower limb ischemia as well as bedside Doppler exams and early consideration of CTA to assess for occult vascular injury."

This prospective observational study was undertaken from June 2017 till March 2018. Individuals aged at least 18 years who were admitted for CAG through upper extremity were eligible and categorized to TSA (n = 70) and TRA (n = 56) groups. Occurrence of complications including hematoma, pain or paresthesia, pseudoaneurysm formation, arterial obstruction, limb ischemia, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and emergency vessel revascularization was assessed after the procedure and in two separate visits three and six months afterwards. The mean age of participants in TSA and TRA groups was 55.1 ± 9.7 and 56.5 ± 9.6 years, respectively (P = 0.415). Men were the dominant group in both approaches [TSA: 44 (62.8%), TRA: 36 (64.3%), P = 0.868]. Success rates in TSA and TRA were 88.6% and 94.6%, respectively (P = 0.230). Radial artery occlusion (RAO) was reported in two (3.2%) and one (1.8%) case in TRA and TSA, respectively (P = 0.653). MACE incidence was not significantly different in TSA compared with TRA group (1.8% vs. 4.8%, respectively, P = 0.389). There was no major procedural complication, neither in TSA nor in TRA category. Our results revealed that TSA could be classified as an alternative modality to other common CAG and angioplasty methods due to its high safety rate and lower complications. Several comprehensive population-based studies are necessary for confirming these findings."

    "abstract": "The 4D-printing technology is applied to fabricate a shape memory peripheral stent with good biocompatibility, which sustains long-term drug release. The star polymer s-PCL is prepared by ring opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone with the -OH of β-cyclodextrin (βCD) as initiator, and then the s-PCL is modified with acrylate endgroup which allows the polymerization under UV light to form the crosslinking network c-PCL. Attributed to the feature of the high crosslinked structure and chemical nature of polycaprolactone (PCL) and βCD, the composite exhibits appropriate tensile strength and sufficient elasticity and bursting pressure, and it is comparable with great saphenous vein in human body. The radial support of the 4D-printed stent is 0.56 ± 0.11 N and is equivalent to that of commercial stent. The cell adhesion and proliferation results show a good biocompatibility of the stent with human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Due to the presence of βCD, the wettability and biocompatibility of the materials are improved, and the sustained paclitaxel release based on the host-guest complexion shows the potential of the drug-loaded stent for long-term release. This study provides a new strategy to solve the urgent need of small-diameter scaffolds to treat critical limb ischemia."

    "abstract": "Effective revascularization of the patient with peripheral artery disease is about more than the procedure. The approach to the patient with symptom-limiting intermittent claudication or limb-threatening ischemia begins with understanding the population at risk and variation in clinical presentation. The urgency of revascularization varies significantly by presentation; from patients with intermittent claudication who should undergo structured exercise rehabilitation before revascularization (if needed) to those with acute limb ischemia, a medical emergency, who require revascularization within hours. Recent years have seen the rapid development of new tools including wires, catheters, drug-eluting technology, specialized balloons, and biomimetic stents. Open surgical bypass remains an important option for those with advanced disease. The strategy and techniques employed vary by clinical presentation, lesion location, and lesion severity. There is limited level 1 evidence to guide practice, but factors that determine technical success and anatomic durability are largely understood and incorporated into decision-making. Following revascularization, medical therapy to reduce adverse limb outcomes and a surveillance plan should be put in place. There are many hurdles to overcome to improve the efficacy of lower extremity revascularization, such as restenosis, calcification, microvascular disease, silent embolization, and tools for perfusion assessment. This review highlights the current state of revascularization in peripheral artery disease with an eye toward technologies at the cusp, which may significantly impact current practice."

SGLT2is are currently indicated in North America and in Europe in type 2 diabetes mellitus, especially in patients with cardiovascular (CV) disease, high CV risk, heart failure, or renal disease. In Europe, dapagliflozin is also approved as an adjunct to insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. New data provide evidence for benefits in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and chronic kidney disease, including in patients without diabetes. The use of SGLT2is is expected to increase, suggesting that a growing number of patients will present to the emergency departments with these drugs. Most common adverse events are easily treatable, including mild genitourinary infections and conditions related to volume depletion. However, attention must be paid to some potentially serious adverse events, such as hypoglycemia (when combined with insulin or insulin secretagogues), lower limb ischemia, and diabetic ketoacidosis.

No-option chronic limb threatening ischemia is defined as limb ischemia for which no treatment options exist and where lower limb amputation is necessary in the short term. The values and preferences identified in this study can help improve decision-making processes. This was a qualitative study, using semi-structured interviews to gather data from patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals. Participants were selected from the patient and employee population of an academic medical center in The Netherlands. Nine patients and seven caregivers who dealt with lower limb amputation for no-option chronic limb threatening ischemia six to twelve months prior to the interview and were not cognitively impaired were selected. Nine healthcare professionals dealing with patients with no-option chronic limb threatening ischemia and lower limb amputation were selected. Lower limb amputation was explicitly discussed late in the disease process, sometimes during an emergency setting. Patients stated goals were never discussed, healthcare professionals stated they were. The most important goal for patients was to live independently after lower limb amputation. Patients and caregivers feel healthcare professionals should be upfront about the possible necessity of lower limb amputation. Reasons to undergo lower limb amputation were absence of treatment options, pain and wanting to enjoy life again. Participants indicated accelerating lower limb amputation was not a viable option. All stakeholders reported overlapping values and preferences regarding main reasons for lower limb amputation, the primary goals after lower limb amputation, and the absence of a desire to accelerate lower limb amputation. The main difference in values and preferences is the preferred timing of discussing lower limb amputation."

Aortic repair was performed before limb interventions in 36 patients (86%; 19 TEVAR, 16 open arch and ascending repair, and 1 open descending aortic repair with fenestration). Seven (19%) had immediate failure with persistent malperfusion recognized in the operating room and underwent additional limb intervention, including extra-anatomic revascularization (n = 4), iliac stenting (n = 2), and femoral patch with septal fenestration or tacking (n = 2). Three patients (8%) had early delayed failure requiring extra-anatomic bypass in two and amputation in one. In contrast, six patients had limb-first intervention with extra-anatomic revascularization. None had immediate failure, but one-half had early delayed failure requiring proximal aortic intervention: two TEVAR and one open aortic fenestration. Limb-first patients were more likely to have early delayed failure compared with aortic dissection treated first patients (50% vs 8%; P = .029). The amputation rate was 2%, occurring in one type A patient. The overall in-hospital mortality was 7% (n = 3), with no difference between type A and type B aortic dissection. There was no difference in surgical site infection, postoperative dialysis need, stroke, and myocardial infarction. In patients presenting with acute aortic dissection with limb ischemia, resolution of the malperfusion occurs in the majority of cases after primary aortic dissection intervention, emphasizing the usefulness of urgent TEVAR for complicated type B and open repair of type A before lower extremity intervention. Limb-first interventions have a higher early delayed failure rate and thus require more frequent reoperation. However, the overall amputation rate in LEM owing to aortic dissection remains low."

    "title": "Acute compartment syndrome resultant from alcohol abuse.",
    "abstract": "Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) is defined as a severe rise in pressure within a fascial compartment thereby leading to impaired microvascular perfusion of the limb. Therefore, ACS is a surgical emergency and if not treated immediately, permanent neurovascular and muscular compromise can ensue. When compartment syndrome is suspected, clinical recognition and timely assessment of the limb is essential to preventing limb ischemia. The classic cause of ACS is trauma; however, coagulopathies have been known to incite these events. Hemorrhage into a compartment can cause ACS but is rare in the literature. Here we present a case of thrombophilia resulting from pathological liver disease, leading to ACS that ultimately led to limb exsanguination. Education on early recognition of liver disease as an indirect underlying cause of ACS is imperative in order to prevent the dangerous sequelae that follow ACS."

    "abstract": "For more than a year, health systems all over the world have been combating the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first described in the city of Wuhan in China, presenting as an atypical infection of the lower respiratory tract. COVID-19 is characterized by multisystemic involvement, and mortality is attributed mainly to the respiratory system involvement, which may lead to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure. Several COVID-19-associated complications are being increasingly reported, including arterial and venous thromboembolic events that may lead to amputation of the affected limbs. So far, a large number of reports have described hypercoagulability crises leading to amputation of the lower limbs. However, a search of the National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE) revealed no cases of urgent upper limb amputation in COVID-19 patients. This article describes a novel case of upper limb ischemia in a COVID-19 patient, with rapid progression to hand necrosis, requiring urgent through-arm amputation of the upper limb. This case emphasizes the need for anticoagulant therapy in COVID-19 patients and to maintain a constant awareness of the possible thromboembolic COVID-19-related sequelae."

    "abstract": "Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is the gold standard for surgical management of descending thoracic aortic pathology. Depending on the anatomy, TEVAR often requires deployment across the origin of the left subclavian artery (LSA) to obtain a proximal seal, thus potentially compromising perfusion to the left upper extremity (LUE). However, in most patients this is generally well tolerated without revascularization due to collateralization from the left vertebral artery (LVA). We present a complex 59-year-old Caucasian patient case of TEVAR with a history of prior arch debranching and intraoperative LSA coverage requiring subsequent LSA embolization and emergency take-back for left carotid-subclavian bypass. The purpose of this case report is to highlight an often overlooked anatomic LVA variant and an atypical, delayed presentation of acute LUE limb ischemia."

    "abstract": "Endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) is obviously less invasive than open aortic repair (OAR) for the treatment of infra-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). However, it is not free of complications which can potentially result in severe morbidity or even mortality. The purpose of this study was to share our single-center experience with stent-graft related and systemic complications associated with EVAR. Patients with infra-renal AAA treated by elective and emergency EVAR between March 2014 and November 2020 were retrospectively identified. Demographic data, risk factors, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, systemic complications, stent-graft related complications, surgical site complications, 30-day mortality, late EVAR related mortality, estimated blood loss, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS and follow-up durations were collected and analyzed. A total of 43 patients underwent EVAR during the period of study. There were 42 males (97.7%) and 1 female (2.3%). The mean age was 68.8 ± 6.2 years. Elective EVAR was performed in 36 (83.7%) and emergency EVAR in 7 (16.3%). Technical success was achieved in 42 patients (100%) with no conversion to OAR. Stent-graft related complications were (21.0%) endoleaks, (2.3%) graft limb occlusion, (0%) graft infection, and (2.3%) rupture-EVAR. Systemic complications were (2.3%) myocardial infarction (MI), (2.3%) stroke, (2.3%) spinal cord injury (SCI), (2.3%) respiratory failure, (19.0%) wound complications, and (2.3%) acute lower limb ischemia (ALI). The 30-day mortality was (2.3%) due to perioperative MI and the late graft related mortality was (2.3%) due to rupture-EVAR. EVAR showed a high technical success rate with no conversion to OAR. The most common complications were type II and type I endoleaks followed by graft limb occlusion. The 30-day mortality was 2.3% due to perioperative MI. Only one late stent-graft related mortality was registered due to rupture-EVAR."

    "abstract": "The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly since it was identified. We sought to understand its effects on vascular surgery practices stratified by VASCON surgical readiness level and determine how these effects have changed during the course of the pandemic. All members of the Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Society were sent electronic surveys questioning the effects of COVID-19 on their practices in the early pandemic in April (EP) and four months later in the pandemic in August (LP) 2020. Response rates were 206/731 (28%) in the EP group and 108/731 (15%) in the LP group (P < 0.0001). Most EP respondents reported VASCON levels less than 3 (168/206,82%), indicating increased hospital limitations while 6/108 (6%) in the LP group reported this level (P < 0.0001). The EP group was more likely to report a lower VASCON level (increased resource limitations), and decreased clinic, hospital and emergency room consults. Despite an increase of average cases/week to pre-COVID-19 levels, 46/108 (43%) of LP report continued decreased compensation, with 57% reporting more than 10% decrease. Respondents in the decreased compensation group were more likely to have reported a VASCON level 3 or lower earlier in the pandemic (P = 0.018). 91/108(84%) of LP group have treated COVID-19 patients for thromboembolic events, most commonly acute limb ischemia (76/108) and acute DVT (76/108). While the majority of respondents are no longer delaying the vascular surgery cases, 76/108 (70%) feel that vascular patient care has suffered due to earlier delays, and 36/108 (33%) report a backlog of cases caused by the pandemic. COVID-19 had a profound effect on vascular surgery practices earlier in the pandemic, resulting in continued detrimental effects on the provision of vascular care as well as compensation received by vascular surgeons."

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is a multisystemic disorder. Hematologic and cardiovascular involvement of COVID-19 causes thromboembolic events across multiple organs which mainly manifest as venous thromboembolism, and rarely, peripheral arterial thromboembolic events. In-situ thrombosis of a healthy, non-atherosclerotic native artery is rare, and COVID-19 has been reported to be a cause of this phenomenon. We aimed to report our institutional experience with COVID-19 patients who developed acute limb ischemia (ALI) during hospitalization or after discharge. This was a single-center cross-sectional study. Records of all patients ≥18 years of age admitted to a tertiary center with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection between September 1 and December 31, 2020 were retrospectively examined. Data regarding patient demographics, co-morbidities and outcomes were collected. Patients were followed-up during index hospitalization and for 30 days postdischarge. Acute limb ischemia was diagnosed by means of duplex ultrasound and computed tomography angiography in the presence of a clinical suspicion. A total of 681 consecutive patients (38.5% women) were hospitalized with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 during the study period. Median age was 63 years (IQR, 52-74). In-hospital mortality occurred in 94 (13.8%) patients. Ninety (13.2%) patients required intensive care unit admission at some point of their hospital stay. Six (0.9%) patients (one woman) with a median age of 62 years experienced ALI (IQR, 59-64.3). All patients were receiving low molecular weight heparin when they developed ALI. The median of duration between COVID-19 diagnosis and ALI symptom onset was 13 days (IQR, 11.3-14). Three patients underwent emergent surgical thrombectomy combined with systemic anticoagulation, and 3 received systemic anticoagulation alone. Two patients with ALI did not survive to hospital discharge. Among survivors, 1 patient underwent bilateral major amputations, and another underwent a minor amputation within 1 month of hospital discharge. Symptoms of ALI completely resolved in 2 patients without sequelae. COVID-19 is a multisystemic disorder with involvement of hematologic and cardiovascular systems. Despite widespread use of thromboprophylaxis, hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are at increased risk of ALI, and subsequent limb loss or even death."

    "abstract": "To evaluate outcomes of endovascular treatment (EVT) using a combination of multiple endovascular techniques for acute lower limb ischemia (ALLI) and to compare outcomes based on vessel type and artery location. A total of 95 consecutive patients with ALLI (mean age, 72.0 years; 65 males; 104 lower limbs) who received emergency EVT using a combination of multiple endovascular techniques including thrombolysis, aspiration thrombectomy, stenting, and balloon angioplasty with or without surgical thromboembolectomy, between January 2005 and December 2017 were included. Vessel type was classified into native artery occlusion (native occlusion) and bypass graft occlusion (graft occlusion), including prosthetic and vein graft. Additionally, native arteries were categorized into below-knee occlusion and non-below-knee occlusion. Technical success, perioperative death (POD), ALLI-related death, amputation, amputation-free survival (AFS), and complications were compared according to vessel type (native occlusion vs. graft occlusion) and artery location (below-knee occlusion vs. non-below-knee occlusion). Of all patients with ALLI, 16.8% underwent a single endovascular technique, whereas 83.2% underwent a combination of multiple endovascular techniques. The technicalsuccess, POD, and ALLI-related death rates in the total number of patients were 94.7%, 11.6%, and 4.2%, respectively. A total of 67 patients (75 limbs) and 28 patients (29 limbs) were classified as having native occlusion and graft occlusion (prosthetic, 24 limbs; vein, 5 limbs), respectively. No significant differences in technical success (native occlusion: 92.5% vs. graft occlusion: 100%), POD (14.9% vs. 3.6%), and ALLI-related death (6.0% vs. 0%) were noted between native occlusion and graft occlusion. However, the 30-day AFS rate of native occlusion was significantly lower than that of graft occlusion (75.2% vs. 96.3%, P=0.01). The amputation rate (P=0.03) and AFS rate (P=0.03) of below-knee occlusion were significantly worse for below-knee occlusion patients than for non-below-knee occlusion patients. EVT using multiple endovascular techniques for ALLI is effective and safe. A combination of multiple endovascular techniques is crucial for successful treatment. However, native occlusion may have a lower AFS rate than graft occlusion, and below-knee occlusion may have a higher risk of amputation than non-below-knee occlusion."

They suffer unacceptably high complication rates including recurrent ALI, vascular amputation, and death. In this article, we examine (1) the burden of cardiovascular complications according to PAD severity, (2) discuss medical optimization to improve vascular outcomes in symptomatic LE-PAD patients, and (3) review the evidence for management of patients following urgent/emergent limb ischemia. The VOYAGER trial recently demonstrated that rivaroxaban 2.5 mg BID + ASA daily significantly reduces major adverse cardiac and limb events in patients following lower extremity revascularization. A recent Canadian survey also demonstrated that significant heterogeneity exists in antithrombotic prescribing practices following urgent/emergent revascularization. COMPASS and VOYAGER have demonstrated the efficacy of aspirin 81 mg daily and rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily at reducing MACE and MALE events in stable PAD patients and those undergoing elective revascularization. Patients who require urgent or emergent peripheral revascularization remain the highest thrombotic risk subgroup of PAD patients, in whom there is insufficient evidence to guide antithrombotic therapy. Despite clear evidence that multi-modal medical therapy (including statins, antihypertensive agents and smoking cessation) benefits patients with atherosclerosis, their use remains unacceptably low in PAD, and greater efforts are needed to understand and address patient, health provider, and system issues that prevent their optimal implementation in practice."

The aim of this study was to create a risk prediction model for treatment outcomes 30 days after revascularization in patients with CLTI. Consecutive patients with CLTI who had undergone revascularization between 2013 and 2016 were collected from the JAPAN Critical Limb Ischemia Database (JCLIMB). The cohort was divided into a development and a validation cohort. In the development cohort, multivariable risk models were constructed to predict major amputation and/or death and major adverse limb events using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression. This developed model was applied to the validation cohort and its performance was evaluated using c-statistic and calibration plots. Some 2906 patients were included in the analysis. The major amputation and/or mortality rate within 30 days of arterial reconstruction was 5.0 per cent (144 of 2906), and strong predictors were abnormal white blood cell count, emergency procedure, congestive heart failure, body temperature of 38°C or above, and hemodialysis. Conversely, moderate, low or no risk in the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) and ambulatory status were associated with improved results. The c-statistic value was 0.82 with high prediction accuracy. The rate of major adverse limb events was 6.4 per cent (185 of 2906), and strong predictors were abnormal white blood cell count and body temperature of 38°C or above. Moderate, low or no risk in the GNRI, and age greater than 84 years were associated with improved results. The c-statistic value was 0.79, with high prediction accuracy. This risk prediction model can help in deciding on the treatment strategy in patients with CLTI and serve as an index for evaluating the quality of each medical facility."

    "abstract": "Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a severe type of peripheral artery disease (PAD) which occurs due to an inadequate supply of blood to the limb extremities. Patients with CLI often suffer from extreme cramping pain, impaired wound healing, immobility, cardiovascular complications, amputation of the affected limb and even death. The conventional therapy for treating CLI includes surgical revascularization as well as restoration of angiogenesis using growth factor therapy. However, surgical revascularization is only suitable for a small percentage of CLI patients and is associated with a high perioperative mortality rate. The use of growth factors is also limited in terms of their poor therapeutic angiogenic potential, as observed in earlier clinical studies which could be attributed to their poor bio-availability and non-specificity issues. Therefore, to overcome the aforesaid disadvantages of conventional strategies there is an urgent need for the advancement of new alternative therapeutic biomaterials to treat CLI. In the past few decades, various research groups, including ours, have been involved in developing different pro-angiogenic nanomaterials. Among these, zinc oxide nanoflowers (ZONFs), established in our laboratory, are considered one of the more potent nanoparticles for inducing therapeutic angiogenesis. In our earlier studies we showed that ZONFs promote angiogenesis by inducing the formation of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide (NO) as well as activating Akt/MAPK/eNOS cell signaling pathways in endothelial cells. Recently, we have also reported the therapeutic potential of ZONFs to treat cerebral ischemia through their neuritogenic and neuroprotective properties, exploiting angio-neural cross-talk. Considering the excellent pro-angiogenic properties of ZONFs and the importance of revascularization for the treatment of CLI, in the present study we comprehensively explore the therapeutic potential of ZONFs in a rat hind limb ischemia model (established by ligating the hind limb femoral artery), an animal model that mimics CLI in humans. The behavioral studies, laser Doppler perfusion imaging, histopathology and immunofluorescence as well as estimation of serum NO level showed that the administration of ZONFs could ameliorate ischemia in rats at a faster rate by promoting therapeutic angiogenesis to the ischemic sites. Altogether, the present study offers an alternative nanomedicine approach employing ZONFs for the treatment of PADs."

A 59-year-old patient presented with an acute abdominal pain evolving for one day with a clinical presentation in favor of peritonitis by perforation of the last ileal loop and acute limb ischemia. At emergency laparotomy, we found a fecal peritonitis by perforation of the last ileal loop. The patient underwent an ileo-caecal resection with rifle barrel ileo-colostomy associated with embolectomy using a Fogarty catheter of the femoral artery. Pathological examination of the specimen showed an aspect consistent with an ileo-caecal Crohn's disease and blood clot embolus of the femoral artery. Postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was kept in remission with immunosuppressants. Several complications may arise during the evolution of the disease. However, Life-threatening complication scarcely inaugurate crohn's disease like in our patient. Free perforation of the small intestine in crohn's disease occurs rarely, which makes its statistical study difficult. Risk factors for perforation are still poorly identified. Patients diagnosed with crohn's disease have a higher risk of thromboembolic complications. Indeed, there is an association between the activity of the disease and thromboembolic events. In our case, the severity of the clinical presentation as well as its inaugural character are unique. The management of inaugural two uncommon acute conditions in Crohn's disease is challenging."

We compared those data with the two-month period before the pandemic (P0). Compared to P0, ambulatory activities were severely reduced during P1 and limited to hospitalized patients and outpatients with urgent criteria. We performed 61 operations (18 urgent and 43 elective), with a decrease in both aortic (-17.8%), cerebrovascular (-53.3%), and peripheral artery (-42.6%) disease treatments. We also observed a greater drop in open procedures (-53.2%) than in endovascular ones (-22%). All the elective patients were treated for notdeferrable conditions and they were COVID-19 negative at the ward admission screening; despite this one of them developed COVID19 during the hospital stay. Four COVID-19 positive patients were treated in urgent setting for acute limb ischemia.

    "abstract": "Creation of good long-term arteriovenous access is essential in patients requiring hemodialysis for end-stage renal failure. However, arteriovenous grafts or fistulae can be complicated by infection that may require emergency surgery. For infections that involve the brachial artery anastomosis, or if total graft explantation is indicated, brachial artery repair or reconstruction is often required. An alternative management strategy would be brachial artery ligation (BAL). We performed a systematic review to evaluate the outcomes of BAL that has been performed for infected arteriovenous grafts or fistulae. A thorough literature search was conducted using various electronic databases. We included articles that reported outcomes of BAL performed for infected arteriovenous grafts or fistulae. The primary outcome was the incidence of upper limb ischemia after BAL. Secondary outcomes were the need for urgent revascularization, need for upper limb amputation, and incidence of postoperative neurological deficit after BAL. A total of five studies with a total of 125 patients were included in our systematic review. BAL was performed for infected arteriovenous grafts or fistulae for all studies. Follow-up period ranged from 1 to 27 months. The incidence of upper limb ischemia after BAL was low. Only a single study reported three patients who developed upper limb ischemia. Two patients required urgent revascularization, and one patient required forearm amputation after proximal ligation. All studies reported clearance of infection with no recurrence. Distal BAL may be performed safely for patients with infected arteriovenous fistulae or grafts with low risk of upper limb ischemia, postoperative neurological deficit, and recurrent infection."

The Society for Vascular Surgery Patient Safety Organization queried both data managers and physicians in May 2020 to discern the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately three fourths of physicians (74%) had adopted a restrictive operating policy for urgent and emergent cases only. However, one half had considered \"time sensitive\" elective cases as urgent. Data manager case entry was affected by both low case volumes and low staffing resulting from reassignment or furlough. A sevenfold reduction in arterial Vascular Quality Initiative case volume entry was noted in the first quarter of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019. The downstream consequences of delaying vascular procedures for carotid artery stenosis, aortic aneurysm repair, vascular access, and chronic limb ischemia remain undetermined. Further ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown will likely be amplified if resumption of elective vascular care is delayed beyond a short window of time."

    "abstract": "Blunt thoracic aortic injuries (BTAIs) are an uncommon traumatic injury that if not treated promptly, can result in death. We present the case of a BTAI with aberrant aortic anatomy. A 60-year-old female was involved in a motor vehicle crash where she suffered significant polytrauma including a BTAI. She was also found to have an aberrant right subclavian artery originating from the aortic arch. Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair (TEVAR) with a right common carotid artery to right subclavian artery bypass was accomplished. She required three more vascular surgical interventions, two for persistent type II endoleak and the third for left upper extremity acute limb ischemia. She had a 2-month hospital course for her devastating injuries and was eventually discharged home. A follow-up CT angiogram showed a stable thoracic aortic arch stent. BTAIs are uncommon in the trauma population. In our patient who had an aberrant right subclavian artery, further procedures were required in the form of a right common carotid artery to right subclavian artery bypass and embolizations to resolve endoleaks. Blunt thoracic aortic injuries are life threatening and require urgent intervention. TEVAR is associated with better outcomes. An aberrant right subclavian artery originating from the aortic arch, distal to the left subclavian artery is an anatomic variant that adds significant complexity to TEVAR. TEVAR is still an option for repair of blunt thoracic aortic injuries despite anatomic variations as open repair still carries an increased risk of morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "Cases of systemic thromboembolism due to thrombus formation in the pulmonary vein stump after lobectomy have been reported recently. Cerebral infarction after left upper lobectomy is a common symptom in these cases. We encountered a rare case of acute limb ischemia caused by a thrombus formed in the left inferior pulmonary vein stump after left lower lobectomy. A 62-year-old man underwent video-assisted left lower lobectomy under general anesthesia with epidural anesthesia. On postoperative day 2, he suddenly developed pain in the left calf. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed left popliteal artery occlusion and thrombus formation in the left inferior pulmonary vein stump. Anticoagulant therapy was started immediately, and emergent endovascular thrombectomy was performed. The patient recovered without complications. Left lower lobectomy can cause thrombus formation in the pulmonary vein stump, leading to systemic thromboembolism. Early detection and treatment are the keys to minimize complications."

This study sought to evaluate pathology specimens of COVID-19-positive patients postamputation, who were found to have Rutherford 3 acute limb ischemia requiring amputation. A retrospective review was performed of all vascular surgery emergency room and inpatient consultations in patients who presented to the Mount Sinai Health System from March 26, 2020, to May 10, 2020. Pathology specimens were examined using hematoxylin and eosin stain. The specimens were assessed for the following: inflammatory cells associated with endothelium/apoptotic bodies, mononuclear cells, small vessel congestion, and lymphocytic endotheliitis. Of the specimens evaluated, 2 patients with a known history of peripheral vascular disease were excluded. Inflammatory cells associated with endothelium/apoptotic bodies were seen in all 4 patients and in 4 of 5 specimens. Mononuclear cells were found in 2 of 4 patients. Small vessel congestion was seen in all patients. Lymphocytic endotheliitis was seen in 1 of 4 patients. This study shows endotheliitis in amputation specimens of four patients with COVID-19 disease and Rutherford Class 3 acute limb ischemia. The findings in these patients is more likely an infectious angiitis because of COVID-19."

    "abstract": "We report a case of stent graft occlusion, severe lower extremity ischemia, and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm due to type B acute aortic dissection 3 years after endovascular aneurysm repair. He admitted our hospital because of abrupt back pain and dysesthesia of bilateral lower limb. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed type B acute aortic dissection and occlusion of the stent graft due to dynamic compression by the false lumen. Emergent right axillo-bifemoral bypass operation was done for his critical limb ischemia. Immediately after the successful operation, he fell into shock vital and dissecting abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture was revealed by CT scan. We performed the stump occlusion of the infrarenal abdominal aorta and the bilateral common iliac arteries by abdominal midline incision. Postoperative myonephropathicmetabolic syndrome due to the left ischemia resulted in amputation of his left lower leg for lifesaving. While EVAR cases are increasing, various its complications come to be reported. We consider that this case report might be cautious about the indication of EVAR for the younger generation.

    "abstract": "A 60-year-old male with a history of primary hypertension presented to the emergency department of a tertiary care hospital, in Pakistan, with complaints of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. He tested positive for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction, with bilateral infiltrates found in chest X-ray. At admission, oxygen saturation was 80% on room air; hence, he was immediately put on non-invasive ventilation. Laboratory investigation revealed elevated D-dimer, international normalized ratio, and total leukocyte count. C-reactive protein was markedly elevated (82.5 mg/L), indicating the state of a cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Treatment started with antibiotics, prophylactic enoxaparin (40-mg subcutaneous once daily), methyl prednisone 60 mg BD and multivitamins. Intravenous tocilizumab (TCZ) 6 mg/kg was started from Day 1 to address the CRS. On Day 3, he complained of pain in the right lower limb with signs of hypothermia, numbness, and slight blackening of the right foot. Peripheral pulses were not palpable, and vascular ultrasound showed no vascular flow in the popliteal, anterior and posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis artery. The Vascular Surgery department declared the limb unsalvageable and right limb above-knee amputation. On Day 9, the right foot was blackened and atrophied extending up to the knee. Above-knee amputation was done, and he was discharged on rivaroxaban after 48 hours of observation. We conclude that heparin is effective in treating coronavirus disease 2019-associated coagulopathy, while TCZ, simultaneously, decreases the severity of CRS. Our case suggests that the concomitant use of TCZ and anticoagulation therapy can be beneficial in patients presenting with arterial and venous thrombosis."

    "abstract": "A 37-year-old pregnant woman who had undergone three previous cesarean sections was diagnosed as having placenta percreta. We decided to perform cesarean hysterectomy with bilateral common iliac artery balloon occlusion (CIABO). The duration of surgery was 2 h and 2 min and total estimated blood loss was 2600 mL. Surgery was completed without any surgical complications, but the pulse oximeter waveform of the left leg became undetectable during surgery. We immediately performed angiography after closure of laparotomy and found abnormal pooling of contrast media at the left common iliac artery in the region in which the balloon was positioned. We made a diagnosis of left common iliac artery dissection caused by CIABO. We performed emergent revascularization by intravascular stenting. We conclude that CIABO can cause common iliac artery dissection by mechanical stimulation of the inflated balloon. Careful intraoperative evaluation of limb ischemia and preparation of intravascular treatment is needed for a safe procedure."

    "abstract": "COVID-19 infection may predispose to venous and arterial thromboembolism due to excessive inflammation, hypoxia, immobilization and disseminated intravascular coagulation; however, there are few reports of lower limb ischemia as the main manifestation of the disease. Male patient, 69 years old, asthmatic, ex-smoker and bearer of systemic arterial hypertension, has been admitted to the emergency department with sudden onset of pain in the right lower limb (RLL), associated with cyanosis and reduced temperature of the limb. He has been tested for COVID-19 in the OR with positive result for IGG and IGM. Computed tomography angiography (AngioCT) was performed, showing signs of arterial embolization to both limbs, right internal iliac artery, and superior mesenteric artery. Faced with the threat of limb loss and the absence of signs and symptoms of visceral ischemia, the patient underwent full anticoagulation and RLL thromboembolectomy and tricompartmental fasciotomy. He was discharged after 7 days of hospitalization and demonstrated no other signs and symptoms of COVID-19, following outpatient follow-up. COVID-19 is associated with high risk of thrombotic complications being related to the clinical severity of the patient, with few studies that show symptoms of sudden pain in the lower limb without other complaints. Individuals infected with COVID-19 are at risk for arterial thromboembolic events, and knowledge of such cases is essential in order to create specific protocols for prophylaxis of thrombotic events in these patients, in addition to increasing the suspicion of infection in individuals with acute arterial occlusion, mostly during pandemic times."

The sensitivity of brain tissue to ischemia causes this time dependence of the effectiveness of rTPA. Early recognition and management of a stroke is imperative for positive outcomes in such patients. Clinical assessment warrants immediate treatment for patients with suspected stroke. As emergency physicians, an awareness of stroke mimics who might undergo unwarranted investigations and thrombolysis is important. We present a case of an elderly female who presented with sudden onset of left upper limb weakness, was thrombolysed and was subsequently diagnosed with subclavian artery thrombotic occlusion. Acute limb ischemia is a rare cause of a stroke mimic. It would be prudent for emergency physicians to be aware regarding the same, especially in patients presenting with monoplegia."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is a vascular emergency associated with a high risk for limb loss and death. Most cases result from in situ thrombosis in patients with preexisting peripheral arterial disease or those who have undergone vascular procedures including stenting and bypass grafts. The other common source is cardioembolic. The incidence has decreased in recent times due to better anticoagulation strategies. Patients with suspected ALI should be evaluated promptly by a vascular specialist and consideration should be given for transfer to a higher level of care if such expertise is not available locally. Initial assessment should focus on staging severity of ischemic injury and potential for limb salvage. Neurological deficits can occur early and are an important poor prognostic sign. Duplex ultrasound and computed tomography angiography help plan intervention in patients with a still-viable limb and prompt catheter-based angiography is mandated in patients with an immediately threatened limb. Further investigations need to be pursued to differentiate embolic from thrombotic cause for acute occlusion as this can change management. Options include intravascular interventions, surgical bypass, or a hybrid approach. In this article, the authors discuss the common etiologies, clinical evaluation, and management of patients presenting with acute limb ischemia."

Prospective observational trial using samples obtained from human trauma patients and retrospective observational study using remnant samples from human sepsis patients and arctic ground squirrels. Preclinical interventional study using hind-limb ischemia and reperfusion injury in mice. Level I trauma center emergency room and ICU and animal research laboratories. Adult human sepsis and trauma patients, wild-caught adult arctic ground squirrels, and sexually mature laboratory mice. Ischemia and reperfusion injury was induced in mice by temporary application of tourniquet to one hind-limb. Iodide was administered IV just prior to reperfusion. Free iodide was measured using ion chromatography. Relative to iodide in plasma from normal donors, iodide was increased 17-fold in plasma from trauma patients and 26-fold in plasma from sepsis patients. In arctic ground squirrels, iodide increases over three-fold during hibernation. And during ischemia/reperfusion injury in mice, iodide accumulates in ischemic tissue and reduces both local and systemic tissue damage. Iodide redistributes during stress and improves outcome after injury. Essential functions of iodide may have contributed to its evolutionary selection and be useful as a therapeutic intervention for human patients."

The aim of this paper is to describe the protocols adopted and to evaluate their impact during the acute phase of Coronavirus spread, focusing on the management of elective and urgent/emergent surgery, outpatients activity, and also health staff preservation from intra-hospital Coronavirus disease 2019 infection. Several measures were progressively adopted in the Padova University Hospital to front the Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, with a clear strong asset established by 9 March 2020, after the Northern Italy lockdown. Since this date, the Vascular Surgery Unit started a \"scaled-down\" activity, both for elective surgical procedures and for the outpatient Clinical activities; different protocols were developed for health preservation of staff and patients. We compared a two months period, 30 days before and 30 days after this time point. In particular, emergent vascular surgery was regularly guaranteed as well as urgent surgery (to be performed within 24 h). Elective cases were scheduled for \"non-deferrable\" pathology. A swab test protocol for COVID-19 was applied to health-care professionals and hospitalized patients. The number of urgent or emergent aortic cases remained stable during the two months period, while the number of Hospital admissions via Emergency Room related to critical limb ischemia decreased after national lockdown by about 20%. Elective vascular surgery was scaled down by 50% starting from 9 March; 35% of scheduled elective cases refused hospitalization during the lockdown period and 20% of those contacted for hospitalization where postponed due to fever, respiratory symptoms, or close contacts with Coronavirus disease 2019 suspected cases. Elective surgery reduction did not negatively influence overall carotid or aortic outcomes, while we reported a higher major limb amputation rate for critical limb ischemia (about 10%, compared to 4% for the standard practice period). We found that 4 out of 98 (4%) health-care providers on the floor had an asymptomatic positive swab test. Among 22 vascular doctors, 3 had a confirmed Coronavirus disease 2019 infection (asymptomatic); a total of 72 swab were performed (mean = 3.4 swab/person/month) during this period; no cases of severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (deaths or requiring intensive care treatment) infection were reported within this period for the staff or hospitalized patients. Elective vascular surgery needs to be guaranteed as possible during Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. The number of truly emergent cases did not reduce, on the other side, Emergency Room accesses for non-emergent cases decreased. Our preliminary results seem to describe a scenario where, if the curve of the outbreak in the regional population is flattened, in association with appropriate hospitals containment rules, it may be possible to continue the activity of the Vascular Surgery Units and guarantee the minimal standard of care."

To report the remodeling of the Vascular Surgery Department of San Raffaele Hospital as regards the strategies of preparation, escalation, and return to normal activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Regional Authority of Lombardy remodeled the hospitalization system to allocate appropriate resources to treat patients with COVID-19 and to identify \"Hub/Spoke\" hospitals for highly specialized medical activities. The Hubs hospitals were required to guarantee full-time evaluation of all patients presenting with cardiovascular diseases with an independent pathway for patients with suspect or confirmed COVID-19 infection. San Raffaele Hospital was identified as Hub for cardiovascular emergencies and the Vascular Surgery Department was remodeled to face this epidemic situation. Surgical treatment was reserved only to symptomatic, urgent, or emergent cases. Large areas of the hospital were simultaneously reorganized to assist patients with COVID-19. During this period, 135 patients were referred to San Raffaele Vascular Surgery Department. COVID-19 was diagnosed in 24 patients and, among them, acute limb ischemia was the most common cause of admission. At this time, the COVID-19 trend is in decline in Italy, and the local authorities reorganized the healthcare system to return to normal activities avoiding new escalations of COVID-19 cases. The COVID-19 pandemic will be remembered in Lombardy as a cataclysm. Nevertheless, the HUB/spoke system has proven to be a valid model in the management of ischemic emergencies.

TRA pseudoaneurysm is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication that may result in bleeding, infection, graft dysfunction/loss, lower limb ischemia/loss, hemorrhagic shock, and death. TRA pseudoaneurysm treatment remains challenging as it needs to be tailored to the patient characteristics including hemodynamic stability, graft function, anatomy, presentation, and pseudoaneurysm features. This publication discusses the clinical scenario of massive gross hematuria that derived from a retroperitoneal hematoma which originated from an actively bleeding TRA pseudoaneurysm. This case highlights the combined approach of endovascular stent placement and subsequent transplant nephrectomy as a last resort in the management of intractable bleeding from a complicated TRA pseudoaneurysm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published case report of an actively bleeding TRA anastomotic pseudoaneurysm that caused a massive retroperitoneal bleed that in turn evacuated via the bladder after disrupting the ureter-to-bladder anastomosis. A temporizing hemostatic arterial stent placed percutaneously allowed for a safer and controlled emergency transplant nephrectomy."

Our objective is to assess the utility of preoperative stress test in determining patient outcomes. This is a retrospective study utilizing the national Vascular Quality Initiative database. We collected data from 2013-2018 on all patients undergoing lower extremity bypass for CLI and assessed whether or not they had a preoperative stress test. Rates of an MI were then compared between groups of patients who either did not receive a stress test, had a normal stress test or a positive stress test. An MI was distinguished as troponin only and electrocardiogram (EKG)/clinical. Our secondary end point was in-hospital mortality. Univariate and multivariate analysis with the stress test as a covariate was used to determine significance. During this time period, 29,937 bypasses were performed on 27,219 patients. The average age was 67.5 years (±11.09), 66.3% were men, and 17.3% were African American. Risk factors included hypertension (89.5%), diabetes (55.9%), congestive heart failure (20%), coronary artery disease (32.5%), coronary artery bypass graft (22.2%), and percutaneous coronary intervention (21%). 19,108 patients (64.1%) did not undergo the stress test before bypass, 6,830 (22.9%) had a normal stress test, and 2,898 (9.7%) had a positive stress test. Overall rate of an MI was 4%, with 2% being troponin only and 2% EKG/clinical. The positive stress test had a higher rate of troponin only (2.85%) as well as EKG/clinical (3.37%) MI. For every 10 year increase in age, the odds of having a postoperative MI increased by 27% (P < 0.0001). Overall in-hospital mortality was 1.4%. Patients with positive stress tests had a 2.6% mortality compared with normal/not performed at 1.3%. Of the patients who died, 21.5% had an EKG/clinical MI. Of those patients, 50% did not have a stress test, 12% had normal stress tests, and 23% had positive stress tests. When comparing rates of patients who died or had an MI, there was no difference between patients who had no or a normal stress test (7.29%) versus those who had a positive stress test (7.58%), (P = 0.11). A positive stress test before lower extremity bypass is a significant predictor of a postoperative MI. However, mortality increase was minimal in patients with a positive stress test. Therefore, the stress test result should not delay care for patients needing urgent revascularization."

Prolonged length of stay (LOS) has been implicated in the occurrence of SSI across multiple surgical disciplines. The impact of preoperative LOS in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) undergoing LEB is unknown. We examined the association of preoperative LOS on SSI after LEB. A retrospective analysis of the Society for Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative Infrainguinal Bypass Registry identified patients undergoing elective LEB for chronic limb-threatening ischemia from 2003 to 2019. Patients undergoing LEB for acute limb ischemia, urgent/emergent procedures, aneurysm, or who had concomitant suprainguinal bypass were excluded. The primary outcome measure was postoperative SSI. Multivariable forward stepwise logistic regression was then performed including all variables with a P value of less than .10 in both matched and unmatched cohorts to evaluate for demographic and perioperative predictors of SSI. Propensity score matching was used to create matched cohorts of patients for each LOS group. A total of 17,883 LEB procedures were selected for inclusion: 0 days (12,362 LEB), 1 to 2 days (1737 LEB), and 3 to 14 days (3784 LEB).

Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that preoperative LOS of 3 to 14 days was associated with increased rate of SSI (odds ratio [OR], 1.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-3.07; P = .01). Transfusion of 3 or more units (OR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.89-4.36; P < .01) and prolonged procedure length (>220 minutes; OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.26-2.73; P < .01) were also significantly associated with postoperative SSIs. Many factors including preoperative comorbidities and operative complexity covary with preoperative LOS as risk factors for SSI. However, when patients are matched based on comorbidities and factors that would predict overall clinical complexity, preoperative LOS remains important in predicting SSI."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic occlusion (AAO) represents potentially fatal acute vascular emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and intervention. Clinical condition of patients with AAO is frequently severely devastated when surgical intervention is questionable. Our objective was to retrospectively review our institutional experience with AAO and assess predictors of intrahospital mortality and morbidity. This is a retrospective single-center cohort study with prospectively collected data between January 1, 2005 and January 1, 2018. The total number of 28 consecutive patients with AAO were included in our analysis. Patients with acute aortic thrombosis manifested by bilateral acute limb ischemia were divided in two groups based on potential caues of AAO (embolism or in-situ thrombosis) differentiated according to condition of aortoilical segment. We identified 28 patients with AAO. All of them underwent either aortobifemoral bypass (N.=20, 71%) or bilateral trans-femoral thrombectomy (N.=8, 29%). The overall in-hospital mortality was 36%. Factors that influenced in-hospital mortality were: paralysis (OR=4.41, 95% CI: 1.88-21.78) and higher lactate values on admission (OR=1.23, 95% CI: 1.09-1.83), postoperative development of severe acute kidney injury (OR=3.08, 95% CI: 1.42-14.66), hemodialysis (OR=10.74, 95% CI: 1.64-109.78) and bowel ischemia (OR=5.19, 95% CI: 1.58-55.63). Paralysis, higher lactate values, development of acute kidney injury, hemodialysis and bowel ischemia are predictors of worse outcome and may be used for risk stratification of patients with acute aortic occlusion and improve counseling patients and their families about expected postoperative outcomes. Patients with embolism and malignant disease have worse outcome; however, this should be tested in future studies on larger sample."

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which is characterized by a multitude of clinical abnormalities, including hypercoagulability. Although thrombosis is commonly observed in sepsis, the hypercoagulable state associated with COVID-19 is much more dramatic and may not be related to either the severity of the disease or the D-dimer levels. It may be due to a prothrombotic state induced by the disease itself. We report three cases of arterial thrombosis with a significant clot burden requiring urgent medical and surgical intervention. It is now a common practice to initiate anticoagulation for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis based on the D-dimer level in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. However, in our clinical experience, D-dimer levels did not correlate well with the clot burden or the risk for future thrombosis."

    "abstract": "After surgery or other interventions, unplanned readmissions are associated with poor outcomes and drain health care resources. Patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) are at particularly high risk of readmission, and readmissions result in increased health care costs. The primary aims of the study were to discover and compare the 30-day readmission rates of patients who underwent lower extremity surgical bypass (LEB) and endovascular infrainguinal endovascular intervention (IEI) for CLI and to evaluate the relationship between unplanned readmissions likely related to the primary procedure for IEI compared with LEB. The Targeted Vascular Module from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program was queried to identify all infrainguinal LEB or IEI for CLI from 2015 to 2018. Those who were not eligible for the primary outcome of interest were excluded. The primary 30-day outcome was unplanned readmission. Univariate analyses for primary and secondary outcomes were performed using Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank-sum testing. Multivariate analysis was performed using inverse probability weighting and independent risk factors for readmission were identified with logistic regression. There were 12,873 patients who met inclusion criteria. In the LEB cohort, there were 7270 (56.5%) patients, and in the IEI cohort, there were 5603 (43.5%) patients. Thirty percent (n = 1696) of the IEI cohort underwent a tibial intervention, and 49% (n = 3547) underwent a distal bypass. The IEI cohort was more likely to be high physiologic risk (P < .001) and to present with tissue loss (P < .001), whereas the LEB cohort was more likely to have high anatomic risk features (P < .001) and be performed under emergent conditions (P < .001). After multivariable analysis, LEB was found to be independently predictive for both unplanned readmissions due to any cause (adjusted odds ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-1.51; P < .001) and procedure-related unplanned interventions (adjusted odds ratio, 1.85; 95% confidence interval, 1.63-2.11; P < .001). Independent predictors of readmission were LEB, preoperative sepsis, severe chronic kidney disease, dependent functional status, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, high-risk physiologic features, African American race, preoperative steroid use, history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and preoperative tissue loss. LEB is independently associated with unplanned readmission from all causes and from procedure-related causes after adjusting for the measured confounders. More research is required to determine the economic burden of these readmissions."

Transradial access (TRA) is a recently integrated alternative at the authors' institution. This noninferiority study compares the technical success and complication rate of TRA compared with TFA. All patients undergoing emergent endovascular interventions between March 2016 and March 2019 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Data were collected on access type, complications, and procedural success. A noninferiority margin was established from previous randomized trials for technical success (0.475) and complications (0.015). Over 3 years, 96 patients underwent TRA and 335 patients received TFA. The overall technical success rate was 98.1%, without significance based on access strategy (p = 0.078). All femoral arteries and 97.9% (n = 94) of radial arteries were accessed as intended. Complications occurred in 1.0% of TRA and 9.9% of TFA groups (p = 0.002). In the TFA group, complications included access site bleeding, hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, lower limb ischemia, and femoral artery thrombosis (n = 6, 14, 3, 3, and 4, respectively). In the TRA group, complications included radial artery thrombosis (n = 1). Transradial access procedural success and complication rate fell within the lower bound confidence interval of the noninferiority margin, demonstrated the noninferiority of TRA in this data set. Transradial access in a cohort of trauma patients undergoing endovascular intervention does not appear to be inferior to TFA in relation to technical success and complications. For patients where groin access may be challenging, TRA is a useful, efficacious, and safe alternative. Longer-term study is required to fully characterize the advantages and disadvantages of TRA compared with TFA. Therapeutic V."

Quality data collection with subsequent outcomes analysis, benchmarking, and direct feedback is necessary to achieve optimal care. The Outpatient Endovascular and Interventional Society (OEIS) established the OEIS National Registry in 2017 to collect data on safety, efficacy, and quality of care for outpatient endovascular interventions. Since then, it has grown to include a peripheral artery disease (PAD) module with plans to expand to include cardiac, venous, dialysis access, and other procedures in future modules. As a Qualified Clinical Data Registry approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, this application also supports new quality measure development under the Quality Payment Program. All physicians operating in an office-based laboratory or ambulatory surgery center can use the Registry to analyze de-identified data and benchmark performance against national averages. Major adverse events were defined as death, stroke, myocardial infarction, acute onset of limb ischemia, index bypass graft or treated segment thrombosis, and/or need for urgent/emergent vascular surgery. Since Registry inception in 2017, 251 participating physicians from 64 centers located in 18 states have participated. The current database includes 18,134 peripheral endovascular interventions performed in 12,403 PAD patients (mean age 72.3±10.2 years; 60.1% men) between January 2017 and January 2020. Cases were performed primarily in an office-based laboratory (85.1%) or ambulatory surgery center setting (10.4%). Most frequently observed procedure indications from 16,086 preprocedure form submissions included claudication (59%), minor tissue loss (16%), rest pain (9%), acute limb ischemia (5%), and maintenance of patency (3%). Planned diagnostic procedures made up 12.2% of cases entered, with the remainder indicated as interventional procedures (87.6%). The hospital transfer rate was 0.62%, with 88 urgent/emergent transfers and 24 elective transfers. The overall complication rate for the Registry was 1.87% (n=338), and the rate of major adverse events was 0.51% (n=92). Thirty-day mortality was 0.03% (n=6). This report describes the current structure, methodology, and preliminary results of OEIS National Registry, an outcomes-based registry designed to collect quality performance data with subsequent outcome analysis, benchmarking, and direct feedback to aid clinicians in providing optimal care."

    "abstract": "On March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak a pandemic. During this period, surgical activity and admission to the Emergency Department (ED) decreased globally. The aim of this article is to understand how the admission of a patient to the ED for vascular surgery changed in our center in Portugal and if this situation prevented urgent surgical procedures. Through a retrospective study, we compared the volume of patients admitted to the ED during the emergency state (ES) in Portugal with the same period in 2019. In addition, we analyzed the urgent surgical activity during the ES and in the correspondent period of the previous 10 years, regarding limb acute ischemia, acute aortic pathology, and vascular trauma. Two groups of patients were formed-patients operated during the ES and during the non-ES, for control. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS® Statistics, version 25. In the ES, 115 patients were observed at the ED and 179 in the 2019 corresponding period. During the ES, patients significantly recurred less to the ED directly from home (P < 0.001) and were less referred to the ED by primary care doctors (P < 0.001). Patients observed at the ED were significantly more urgent-required urgent surgery or were admitted to the department-than those in 2019 (40% vs. 24%). However, there were no differences when only considering urgent surgery (14% in ES vs. 10% in 2019). In the ES, 38% of patients observed at the ED were discharged with no follow-up related to vascular surgery against 60% in 2019, although this difference was not significant. Compared with the preceding 10 years, there are not significant differences in the number of patients who underwent urgent surgery in both ES and non-ES periods. In patients with acute limb ischemia, we did not find an increase in the time between onset of symptoms and ED admission, during the ES. Fewer patients were admitted at the ED during the ES, and those admitted were significantly more urgent. We did not find a decrease in the number of urgent surgeries when compared with the preceding 10 years. Therefore, we cannot assume that coronavirus pandemic precluded urgent surgical procedures."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to report the experience of one of the major \"hubs\" for vascular surgery in Lombardy, Italy, during the first 7 weeks after total lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic. Data from all patients treated at our Department since the decision of the regional healthcare authorities of Lombardy to centralize surgical specialties creating a hub/spoke system (March 9, 2020) were prospectively collected and compared with a retrospectively collected cohort from the same period of year 2019. Primary study end point was defined as primary clinical success. Secondary end points were defined as in-hospital mortality and/or any in hospital major adverse event or lower limb amputation. One hundred sixteen patients were treated (81 men, 70%; median age: 71 years, IQR 65-81). Thirty-two patients (28%) were addressed from spoke hospitals directly referring to our hub, 19 (16%) from hospitals belonging to other hub/spoke nets, 48 (41%) came directly from our emergency department, and 17 (15%) were already hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia. Acute limb ischemia was the most observed disease, occurring in 31 (26.7%), 12 (38.7%) of whom were found positive for COVID-19 pneumonia on admission, whereas 3 (9.7%) became positive during hospitalization. Chronic limb ischemia was the indication to treatment in 24 (20.7%) patients. Six (5.2%) patients underwent primary amputation for irreversible ischemia. Aortic emergencies included 21 cases (18.1%), including 13 (61.9%) symptomatic abdominal aortic or iliac aneurysms, 4 (19.0%) thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, 2 (9.5%) cases of acute type B aortic dissection (one post-traumatic). Seventeen (14.7%) patients were admitted for symptomatic carotid stenosis (no COVID-19 patients); all of them underwent carotid endarterectomy. Seventeen (14.7%) cases were treated for other vascular emergencies. Overall, at a median follow-up of 23 ± 13 days, primary clinical success was 87.1% and secondary clinical success was 95.9%. We recorded 3 in-hospital deaths for an overall mortality rate of 2.6%. Compared with the 2019 cohort, \"COVID era\" patients were older (72 vs. 63 years, P = 0.002), more frequently transferred from other hospitals (44% vs. 21%, P = 0.014) and more frequently with decompensated chronic limb threatening ischemia (21% vs. 3%, P = 0.015); surgical outcomes were similar between the 2 cohorts. Since its appearance, SARS-CoV-2 has been testing all national healthcare systems which founds themselves facing an unprecedented emergency. Late referral in the pandemic period could seriously worsen limb prognosis; this aspect should be known and addressed by health care providers. Vascular surgical outcomes in pre-COVID and COVID era were comparable in our experience."

However, systematic evidence on this subject is sparse. We aimed to investigate the rate of emergent hospital admissions, subsequent invasive treatments and comorbidities during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. This was a retrospective analysis of health insurance claims data from the second largest insurance fund in Germany, BARMER. Patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction, acute limb ischemia, aortic rupture, stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) between January 1, 2019, and May 31, 2020, were included. Admission rates per 100,000 insured, invasive treatments and comorbidities were compared from January-May 2019 (pre-COVID) to January-May 2020 (COVID). A total of 115,720 hospitalizations were included in the current analysis (51.3% females, mean age 72.9 years). Monthly admission rates declined from 78.6/100,000 insured (pre-COVID) to 70.6/100,000 (COVID). The lowest admission rate was observed in April 2020 (61.6/100,000). Administration rates for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (7.3-6.6), non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (16.8-14.6), acute limb ischemia (5.1-4.6), stroke (35.0-32.5) and TIA (13.7-11.9) decreased from pre-COVID to COVID. Baseline comorbidities and the percentage of these patients treated with interventional or open-surgical procedures remained similar over time across all entities. In-hospital mortality in hospitalizations for stroke increased from pre-COVID to COVID (8.5-9.8%). Admission rates for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular emergencies declined during the pandemic in Germany, while patients' comorbidities and treatment allocations remained unchanged. Further investigation is warranted to identify underlying reasons and potential implications on patients' outcomes."

From January 2013 to December 2018, 825 patients presented with aortic dissection. Of these, 28 patients with non-A non-B dissection (classified as dissection extending into the aortic arch with entry between the left common carotid artery and the left subclavian arteries) underwent a novel hybrid surgery. Self modified stent-grafts (Micropart Corp, Shanghai, China) were implanted via median sternotomy. Clinical presentation, postoperative data, and early outcomes were recorded. All patients underwent an emergency operation. There were no in-hospital mortalities, reexplorations for hemorrhage, reports of paraplegia, cerebral infarctions, endoleaks, or left subclavian artery occlusions. No blood products were required during or after the operations. During the early follow-up at 39.12 ± 15.04 months (6.0-74.0 months), 1 patient was lost to follow-up, and 1 patient died suddenly. Computed tomography angiography showed false lumen patency persisted in the aortic arch and descending aorta without any symptoms. The 6-month computed tomography angiography showed significantly smaller distal aortic arch diameters (31.94 ± 6.95 mm) and descending aorta diameters (34.84 ± 4.15 mm) than measured preoperatively (36.76 ± 4.15 mm and 37.31 ± 4.7 mm, respectively). No paraplegia, cerebral infarction, upper limb ischemia, or left subclavian artery ischemia events were reported. Our inclusion aortic arch technique is a safe, effective, and simple treatment for non-A non-B aortic dissections that can avoid endoleaks, requires no blood products, and has satisfactory early outcomes."

A 64-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital for acute left lower limb ischemia. Six years ago, he underwent bilateral axillary-femoral bypass due to Leriche syndrome. On emergency admission, thrombosis of the left bypass vessel was identified. Blood flow could not be restored due to failure to restore patency of the proximal and distal anastomosis of the left bypass vessel during surgery. We performed LAx-PF bypass surgery to successfully rescue the limb, which was on the verge of necrosis. If thrombectomy cannot restore blood flow in the previous axillary-femoral bypass, LAx-PF bypass is an easy procedure to rescue the ischemic limb."

A bolus of 70-100 IU/kg of heparin is currently recommended for patients undergoing PCI. However, the ideal dose of heparin has not been evaluated in a randomized trial. The higher dose of 100 IU/kg may increase the risk of bleeding. An initial bolus of low-dose heparin may be advantageous to avoid supratherapeutic activating clotting times (ACT) while still allowing for the administration of additional heparin if the ACT is subtherapeutic. From January 2008 to February 2020, 904 patients undergoing elective transfemoral PCI received an initial bolus of 40 IU/kg of heparin. Patients who underwent transradial PCI were not included. Patients were routinely pretreated with dual antiplatelet therapy. The primary end point was the composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), urgent target vessel revascularization (TVR) for ischemia, or major bleeding within 30 days after PCI. The initial mean activating clotting time was 235.4 ± 26.6 s. The clinical event rates were low: the primary end point occurred in 5.3%, cardiac death in 1.0%, MI in 3.1%, urgent TVR in 0.7% and major bleeding in 1.9%. Stent thrombosis was uncommon (0.2%). No patients developed profound thrombocytopenia. Three patients (0.3%) had acute limb ischemia that required revascularization.

The patient will classically have livedo reticularis or \"blue toes.\" We present a case of a patient who presented to the emergency department with the complaint of a painful, blue toe. The patient had intact distal pulses on exam with the distal 2/3 of the first toe having a markedly blue/black color with livedo reticularis spreading proximally on the other 1/3 of the toe. CT angiogram with runoff to the lower extremities revealed a 3.6-cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with a 5-mm penetrating aortic ulcer with a three-vessel runoff to the distal lower extremities. The diagnosis of CES secondary to a PAU was made. While thrombotic embolization from PAU causing acute limb ischemia is less common, it is well described.

The vascular patient is at a higher risk of developing a severe form of the disease because of its nature associating several comorbid states, and thus, some vascular surgery communities from many countries have tried to stratify patients into those requiring care during these uncertain times. This is an observational study describing the current daily vascular surgery practice at one tertiary academic hospital in Madrid region, Spain-one of the most affected regions worldwide due to the COVID-19 outbreak. We analyzed our surgical practice since March 14th when the lockdown was declared up to date, May 14th (2 months). Procedural surgical practice, organizational issues, early outcomes, and all the troubles encountered during this new situation are described. Our department is composed of 10 vascular surgeons and 4 trainees. Surgical practice has been reduced to only urgent care, totaling 50 repairs on 45 patients during the period. Five surgeries were performed on 3 COVID-19-positive patients. Sixty percent were due to critical limb ischemia, 45% of them performed by complete endovascular approach, whereas less than 10% of repairs were aorta related. We were allocated to use a total of 5 surgical rooms in different locations, none our usual, as it was converted into an ICU room while performing 50% of those repairs with unusual nursery staff. The COVID-19 outbreak has dramatically changed our organization and practice in favor of urgent or semiurgent surgical care alone. The lack of in-hospital/ICU beds and changing nursery staff changed the whole availability organization at our hospital and was a key factor in surgical decision-making in some cases."

This survey study sought to identify practice changes, to understand current personal protective equipment (PPE) use, and to determine how caring for patients with COVID-19 differs for vascular surgeons practicing in states with high COVID-19 case numbers vs in states with low case numbers. A 14-question online survey regarding the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on vascular surgeons' current practice was sent to 365 vascular surgeons across the country through REDCap from April 14 to April 21, 2020, with responses closed on April 23, 2020. The survey response was analyzed with descriptive statistics. Further analyses were performed to evaluate whether responses from states with the highest number of COVID-19 cases (New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and California) differed from those with lower case numbers (all other states). A total of 121 vascular surgeons responded (30.6%) to the survey. All high-volume states were represented. The majority of vascular surgeons are reusing PPE. The majority of respondents worked in an academic setting (81.5%) and were performing only urgent and emergent cases (80.5%) during preparation for the surge. This did not differ between states with high and low COVID-19 case volumes (P = .285). States with high case volume were less likely to perform a lower extremity intervention for critical limb ischemia (60.8% vs 77.5%; P = .046), but otherwise case types did not differ. Most attending vascular surgeons worked with residents (90.8%) and limited their exposure to procedures on suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases (56.0%). Thirty-eight percent of attending vascular surgeons have been redeployed within the hospital to a vascular access service or other service outside of vascular surgery. This was more frequent in states with high case volume compared with low case volume (P = .039). The majority of vascular surgeons are reusing PPE (71.4%) and N95 masks (86.4%), and 21% of vascular surgeons think that they do not have adequate PPE to perform their clinical duties. The initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in reduced elective cases, with primarily only urgent and emergent cases being performed. A minority of vascular surgeons have been redeployed outside of their specialty; however, this is more common among states with high case numbers. Adequate PPE remains an issue for almost a quarter of vascular surgeons who responded to this survey."

Although rare, the most feared complication of UGTI is arterial thrombosis or embolism during the off-label injection of thrombin causing acute limb ischemia requiring emergent surgical intervention. Higher thrombin volume, rapidity of injection, and wide or short-neck PSAs are all thought to increase the risk of arterial thrombosis or embolism during this procedure. For patients with unfavorable PSA anatomy who are high-risk surgical candidates due to their medical comorbidities or active critical illness, balloon-assisted thrombin injection (BATI) has been suggested as a means to potentially reduce the risk of thrombosis or distal embolization associated with UGTI. This minimally invasive technique also decreases the risk of groin wound dehiscence or infection associated with open repair, especially in patients who are morbidly obese or have had prior groin surgery. We report a patient with a complex femoral artery PSA after endovascular intervention who was successfully treated with BATI and describe the procedure in detail."

    "title": "Successful Treatment of Acute Limb Ischemia Secondary to Iatrogenic Distal Embolization Using Catheter Directed Aspiration Thrombectomy.",
    "abstract": "Objective: Acute limb ischemia (ALI) due to thromboembolism is a limb- and life-threatening condition regularly encountered by vascular surgeons. Iatrogenic distal embolization is occasionally seen as a complication of various endovascular procedures. We present a series of four patients who developed ALI due to arterial embolization during cardiovascular procedures that were successfully treated via catheter directed aspiration embolectomy. Methods: Retrospective review of demographics, risk factors, and procedural outcomes was completed for 4 patients who presented with ALI due to distal embolization following cardiovascular procedures. All patients were successfully treated with catheter directed aspiration embolectomy using the Penumbra Indigo System (Penumbra Inc., Alameda, California). All patients had high-quality angiography demonstrating successful embolectomy and end-procedure patency. Results: Three patients presented with Rutherford 2A and one with Rutherford 2B ALI secondary to intraoperative distal embolization. Three patients presented with ALI secondary to distal embolization during peripheral vascular interventions, and one following emergent intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement for myocardial infarction. All emboli were located in the infra-inguinal vasculature. Median post-operative ABIs were 0.94 (n = 4). Median length of stay was 2 days. There were no mortalities and no need for adjunctive fasciotomy, amputation, or bypass for limb salvage. All patients improved clinically after intervention, and returned to their reported pre-hospitalization functional status. Conclusion: All procedures achieved technical success with catheter-directed aspiration thrombectomy with or without adjunctive lysis. Catheter-directed aspiration embolectomy with the Penumbra Indigo System for ALI following an iatrogenic embolic event is a safe, less-invasive treatment option. The use of this technology may reduce the need for traditional open thrombectomy or thrombolytic therapy to address ALI."

    "abstract": "The aim of our study was to determine the incidence, characteristics, and clinical outcomes of patients with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection who had presented with and been treated for acute limb ischemia (ALI) during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. We performed a single-center, observational cohort study. The data from all patients who had tested positive for COVID-19 and had presented with ALI requiring urgent operative treatment were collected in a prospectively maintained database. For the present series, successful revascularization of the treated arterial segment was defined as the absence of early (<30 days) re-occlusion or major amputation or death within 24 hours. The primary outcomes were successful revascularization, early (≤30 days) and late (≥30 days) survival, postoperative (≤30 days) complications, and limb salvage. We evaluated the data from 20 patients with ALI who were positive for COVID-19. For the period from January to March, the incidence rate of patients presenting with ALI in 2020 was significantly greater than that for the same months in 2019 (23 of 141 [16.3%] vs 3 of 163 [1.8%]; P < .001)]. Of the 20 included patients, 18 were men (90%) and two were women (10%). Their mean age was 75 ± 9 years (range, 62-95 years). All 20 patients already had a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Operative treatment was performed in 17 patients (85%). Revascularization was successful in 12 of the 17 (70.6%). Although successful revascularization was not significantly associated with the postoperative use of intravenous heparin (64.7% vs 83.3%; P = .622), no patient who had received intravenous heparin required reintervention. Of the 20 patients, eight (40%) had died in the hospital. The patients who had died were significantly older (81 ± 10 years vs 71 ± 5 years; P = .008). The use of continuous postoperative systemic heparin infusion was significantly associated with survival (0% vs 57.1%; P = .042). In our preliminary experience, the incidence of ALI has significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Italian Lombardy region. Successful revascularization was lower than expected, which we believed was due to a virus-related hypercoagulable state. The use of prolonged systemic heparin might improve surgical treatment efficacy, limb salvage, and overall survival."

    "abstract": "COVID-19 infection has been reported to be related with an increased risk of thrombotic complications because of the hypercoagulability state and inflammation. At the moment, no reports are available regarding thrombosis of prosthetic vascular grafts. We present the case of a patient with COVID-19-related pneumonia, who suffered from the acute thrombosis of a previously implanted aortic graft. A 67-year-old male patient, who had undergone open repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm with a bifurcated graft 6 years before, was admitted to the emergency department with high fever for a week without cough or dyspnea. Thoracic ultrasound showed signs of bilateral interstitial pneumonia, and the Sars-Cov-2 swab was positive. Antiretroviral therapy and prophylactic low molecular weight heparin treatment were initiated. Owing to the progressive impairment of the respiratory function, the patient was intubated after eight days from the admission, the day after he showed signs of bilateral acute limb ischemia. A duplex ultrasound demonstrated the complete thrombosis of the aortic graft without flow at the femoral level. An urgent angio-computed tomography scan for revascularization purpose was requested, but the patient died on the arrival in the radiological suite. Acute thrombosis of vascular prosthetic grafts is a possible, catastrophic complication of COVID-19 infection. In COVID-19 patients with prosthetic graft, an aggressive antithrombotic treatment could be considered to prevent such an event."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic syndromes (AASs) are deadly cardiovascular emergencies involving the thoracic aorta. AASs are relatively rare conditions, have unspecific signs and symptoms (including truncal pain, syncope, neurologic deficit and limb ischemia) and require contrast-enhanced tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest and abdomen for conclusive diagnosis and subsequent therapeutic planning. In the Emergency Department (ED), most patients with potential signs/symptoms of AASs are finally found affected by other alternative diagnoses. Hence, misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis of AASs are major concerns. In critically ill patients, decision to perform CTA is usually straightforward, as exam benefits largely outweigh risks. In patients with ST-tract elevation on ECG, suspected primary ischemic stroke and in stable patients (representing the most prevalent ED scenarios), proper selection of patients necessitating CTA is cumbersome, due to concurrent risks of misdiagnosis and over-testing. Available studies support an algorithm integrating clinical probability assessment, bedside echocardiography and D-dimer (if the clinical probability is not high). Therapeutic management includes medical therapy for all patients including an opioid and anti-impulse drugs (a beta-blocker and a vasodilator), targeting a heart rate of 60 bpm and systolic blood pressure of 100-120 mmHg. Patients with AASs involving the ascending aorta are likely candidate for urgent surgery, and complicated type B AASs (severe aortic dilatation, impending or frank rupture, organ malperfusion, refractory pain, severe hypertension) necessitate evaluation for urgent endovascular treatment. For uncomplicated type B AASs, optimal medical therapy is the current standard of care."

    "abstract": "For decades, open intervention was the treatment of choice in patients requiring lower extremity revascularization. In the endovascular era, however, open and endovascular revascularization are options. The implications of prior revascularization on the outcomes for subsequent revascularization are not known. In the present study, we evaluated 30-day outcomes after open lower extremity revascularization for critical limb ischemia (CLI) in those who had previous interventions. The 2012-2017 open lower extremity bypass Participant User Data Files from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program were used to identify a cohort of patients with CLI. Patients whose operation was considered emergent were excluded from the analysis. Patients were stratified on whether they had a previous open or endovascular intervention or undergoing a primary revascularization. The primary outcome measure was 30-day major adverse limb events (MALEs). Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) and wound complications. A total of 12,668 patients met study criteria with 59.6% (n = 7,549) undergoing a primary open revascularization, 22.4% (n = 2,839) having a prior endovascular intervention, and 18.0% (n = 2,280) having a prior open revascularization. There were notable differences in the baseline characteristics between the 3 groups. In addition, there were differences in the reason for intervention (rest pain versus tissue loss), type of revascularization, and type of conduit used between the 3 groups. After adjustment, a prior open revascularization was significantly associated with 30-day MALE when compared with a primary revascularization (adjusted odds ratio, 1.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.47-1.94; P < 0.001) and prior endovascular intervention (adjusted odds ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.46-2.12; P < 0.001). There were no differences in outcomes between primary revascularization and prior endovascular patients. There were no differences between MACEs or wound complications between the 3 groups. A prior endovascular intervention does not seem to accrue any additional short-term risk when compared with primary revascularization, suggesting an endovascular-first approach may be a safe strategy in patients with CLI. However, a prior open intervention is significantly associated with 30-day MALE in patients undergoing redo open revascularization, which may be related to the rapid decline in patients once they have exhausted their best open revascularization option."

LVT can also lead to systemic thromboembolic events causing threatening limb ischemia. We report a rare case of critical bilateral limb ischemia that resulted from peripheral embolization of LVT post MI, which was managed successfully by emergent surgical intervention and anticoagulation. A 74-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and coronary artery disease status post stenting of the left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries presented to the emergency department with typical chest pain and progressive shortness of breath. Cardiac troponin levels on admission were 35 ng/mL of blood. The patient subsequently underwent emergent cardiac catheterization which revealed significant triple vessel disease, and was referred for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiograms revealed the presence of an apical aneurysm with chronic organized mobile thrombus at the apex. Post CABG, the patient complained of excruciating right leg pain. Computed tomography (CT) angiogram of the abdominal aorta and lower extremities revealed a large embolus at the aortic bifurcation occluding the right and nearly occluding the left common iliac arteries and thrombus in the right popliteal artery. He underwent emergent vascular surgery with resolution of his symptoms and remained without further complications. The incidence of LVT remains high in post-MI patients, and complications of LVT are known to include thromboembolic events. Peripheral embolization of acute or chronic LVT leading to bilateral distal embolization and critical limb ischemia remains a rare occurrence. This case report aims to aid clinicians to recognize and promptly manage LVT and related arterial thromboembolic events with anticoagulation and emergent surgical intervention if limb ischemia develops."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia caused by peripheral venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) cannulation is associated with increased mortality. Early detection of limb hypoperfusion may lead to timely intervention and prevent irreversible muscle damage. Methods to determine the adequacy of tissue oxygenation in cannulated extremities include bedside physical examination, trending serum biochemical markers, and somatic near-infrared spectroscopy. To prevent ECMO-related limb ischemia events, interventions include the addition of distal antegrade perfusion catheters to the arterial ECMO canula, minimizing arterial cannula diameter, placing arterial and venous cannulae on opposite extremities, and adding a side-arm graft to the cannulated artery. If the limb develops early signs of ischemia, preventative measures such as distal perfusion catheter insertion or changing the location of the arterial cannula should be performed. Acute compartment syndrome requires emergency fasciotomy or amputation if the limb is unsalvageable. Opportunities for future research include improving monitoring technology and standardizing the use of the distal perfusion catheter."

Two months prior he had a right-sided ureteric stent inserted for ureteric obstruction. Routine bloods revealed an acute-on-chronic renal injury and subsequent noncontrast computed tomography (CT) demonstrated left-sided hydroureter and hydronephrosis suggestive of extrinsic compression by the left bypass graft limb. A new left-sided ureteric stent was inserted and the right exchanged with no gross signs of infection. His impaired renal function precluded intravenous contrast and so a CT with oral contrast showed circumferential oral contrast and gas surrounding the right limb of his ABF. Urgent gastroscopy revealed periprosthetic erosion with the ABF limb traversing the distal third part of the duodenum. He underwent bilateral axillofemoral bypass grafts, laparotomy with explantation of the ABF, and primary duodenojejunostomy. Bilateral ureters were compressed by overlying graft limbs. Bilateral groins were infected with frank pus on exploration and were associated with impending anastomotic disruption of his previous ABF distal anastomoses. His postoperative course was complicated by colonic ischemia with perforation leading to irreversible multiorgan failure. This patient was remarkably well on presentation with life-threatening pathology. He had no abdominal symptoms or gastrointestinal bleeding. This case demonstrates the diagnostic and management difficulties of periprosthetic erosions and the consequences of graft tunneling superficial to ureters."

Patients with PAD often have several comorbidities, including chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Diagnostic and interventional angiography using iodinated contrast agents provides excellent image resolution but can be associated with contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). The use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a contrast agent reduces the volume of iodine contrast required for angiography and reduces the incidence of CIN. However, CO2 angiography has been underutilized due to concerns regarding safety and image quality. Modern CO2 delivery systems with advanced digital subtraction angiography techniques and hybrid angiography have improved imaging accuracy and reduced the incidence of CIN. Awareness of the need for optimal imaging conditions, contraindications, and potential complications have improved the safety of CO2 angiography. This review aims to highlight current technological advances in the delivery of CO2 in vascular angiography for patients with PAD and critical limb ischemia, which result in limb preservation while preventing kidney damage."

    "abstract": "Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a potentially life-threatening condition that involves severely reduced blood flow to the peripheral arteries due to arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) of the limbs or a similar condition. CLI patients must undergo revascularization to avoid amputation of the lower limbs and improve their survival prognosis. However, the outcomes of conventional surgical revascularization or endovascular therapy are inadequate; therefore, establishing further effective treatment methods is an urgent task. We perform therapeutic angiogenesis using autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells in clinical practice and demonstrated its safety and efficacy for CLI patients for whom conventional treatments failed or are not indicated. Exercise therapies must be devised for CLI patients who have undergone therapeutic angiogenesis to save their limbs and improve survival. Because evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of exercise therapy for CLI patients is lacking, we plan to perform a prospective trial of the efficacy and safety of optimal exercise therapy following therapeutic angiogenesis for CLI patients.The trial will enroll 30 patients between 20 and 79 years with Rutherford category 4 or 5 CLI caused by ASO who will undergo therapeutic angiogenesis. Participants will be randomly allocated to receive either optimal exercise therapy or fixed exercise therapy. Those receiving optimal exercise therapy will undergo tissue muscle oxygen saturation monitoring using near-infrared spectroscopy while performing exercises and will be prescribed optimal exercise therapy. The optimal amount of exercise will be determined on day 8, 31, 61, 91 and 181 after therapeutic angiogenesis. This protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine.

Aspiration mechanical thrombectomy (AMT) devices are an alternative approach to remove thrombus in the peripheral arterial system and to restore limb perfusion, but data are limited. We evaluated the outcomes of AMT for the treatment of ALLI at our institution. We performed a single-center retrospective review of patients with ALLI treated with Indigo (Penumbra Inc, Alameda, Calif) AMT device from 2014 to 2017. The primary outcome was technical success (restoration of blood flow with <50% residual thrombus without need for catheter-directed thrombolysis [CDT] or open surgery) as main treatment or adjunctive treatment (after failure of another modality). Indications, anatomic segments treated, outcomes, and complications were reviewed. There were 41 patients (68% male, 32% female; mean age, 67 years; range, 27-90 years) who underwent 43 procedures. The cause of ALLI was embolism (18), native vessel thrombosis (13), bypass thrombosis (7), intraluminal thrombus due to pseudoaneurysm (1), stent thrombosis (1), intraprocedural embolization (1), recurrent thrombosis of native vessel (1), and chronic thrombosis (1). AMT was the main treatment in 29 cases and adjunctive in 14. Technical success was 52% (15/29) as main treatment and 50% (7/14) as adjunctive treatment. Thrombolysis was avoided in 53% of patients (23/43). There were six thrombotic recurrences, one after successful isolated AMT. The other five required multiple modalities after AMT failure. There were no 30-day deaths. Five patients required amputations, but only one after successful AMT. Complications included intraoperative distal embolization (two), access site hematoma (one), pseudoaneurysm (one), acute kidney injury (one), and spontaneous calf hematoma (one). There were no blood transfusions required or severe bleeding complications. With an overall success rate of 51% in selected patients, the Indigo AMT device avoided the need for CDT or open surgery in about half of patients with ALLI. The device has a favorable safety profile, particularly in high-risk cases. Given its moderate effectiveness, the role of Indigo AMT in the management of ALLI will further be defined by the description of optimal technique, the determination of treatment indications, and a direct comparison with CDT."

    "abstract": "Paradoxical embolism is the translocation of a thrombus originating in the systemic venous circulation into the arterial circulation through a cardiac defect, most commonly a patent foramen ovale (PFO). PFO exists in 15-35% of the adult population. The most common manifestation is cerebrovascular accident; acute limb ischemia is much rarer. A 67-year-old woman with multiple confounding risk factors for hypercoagulability presented with grade IIb left lower limb ischemia secondary to thromboembolism through a previously silent PFO. Management included urgent embolectomy, prophylactic fasciotomy, postoperative anticoagulation, and PFO closure. A systematic literature review of PFO-mediated acute limb ischemia was performed to identify the patient populations most commonly affected, the anatomic distribution of emboli, and patient management. Forty-three reports including 51 patients with first-time PFO-mediated paradoxical embolism were identified. Fifty-one percent were men, and the average age at presentation was 54 years. Multiple limbs were affected in 14 patients (27.5%), and a propensity for the lower limbs (72%) and left-sided circulation (82%) was noted. Deep venous thromboembolism was identified in 36 patients (71%). Immediate anticoagulation was instituted in 31 patients. Embolectomy and/or fibrinolysis were performed in 45 patients (88%). Acute limb ischemia is a rare manifestation of PFO-mediated paradoxical embolism that requires a high index of suspicion for diagnosis. Middle-aged individuals appear to be more commonly affected, and acute limb ischemia most often occurs in the lower limbs and left-sided circulation, with the potential to affect multiple extremities simultaneously. Prompt identification and surgical embolectomy with prophylactic fasciotomy can facilitate successful outcomes. Perioperative management should include anticoagulation and may include workup with echocardiography, duplex ultrasound, and hypercoagulability testing."

This was a retrospective consecutive cohort study of patients with ALI who were submitted to endovascular treatment with PMT or fibrinolysis at the Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Hospital do Servidor Público Estadual (São Paulo, Brazil), between July 2015 and December 2018. The limb salvage rate and survival rate at 720 days were analyzed in both the PMT (group 1) and CDT treatment (group 2), as well as the perioperative mortality rate (PMR) at 30 days after surgery. One hundred twelve patients were admitted to the emergency department with ALI between July 2015 and December 2018. Seventeen patients diagnosed with Rutherford III irreversible ALI and 46 patients submitted to open surgery were excluded. Thus, 49 patients were submitted to endovascular surgery; 18 (36.7%) were classified into group 1, and 31 (63.3%) were classified into group 2. The clinical data were equal between the 2 groups, but there was a higher prevalence of thrombophilia in group 1 (3 cases; P < 0.001). The limb salvage rate and the overall survival rate at 720 days were similar between groups 1 and 2 (87.8% vs. 89.7%, P = 0.78 and 84.7% vs. 69.2%, P = 0.82, respectively). There was no statistical difference regarding secondary patency rates at 720 days between groups 1 and 2 (group 1, 81.9% and group 2, 78.8%; P = 0.66). The PMR was 16.7% (8 patients) within the first 30 days. Group 2 had a higher overall mortality rate (OMR) (6 patients, 19.3%, P = 0.03). Regarding the PMT group, there was a higher rate of complications such as myoglobinuria, hematuria, acute renal failure, and death in the subgroup of patients in whom there were performed more than 150 cycles/sec during the surgery (P < 0.001). In the present study, the PMT and CDT endovascular procedures had similar limb salvage, overall survival, and secondary patency rates. However, the OMR was higher in the CDT group. Another important finding was related to the number of cycles/sec performed in the PMT group, in whom patients with more than 150 cycles/sec have presented with higher rates of hematuria, myoglobinuria, acute renal failure, and death."

Duplex sonography revealed thrombotic occlusion and the absence of flow in both the ulnar and radial arteries. Electrocardiogram exhibited atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 88 bpm. Antegrade puncture of the brachial artery was performed, and digital subtraction angiography confirmed fresh occlusion of the ulnar and radial arteries with some residual flow in the accessory brachial artery. Thrombus aspiration using a 6-Fr Eliminate aspiration catheter (Terumo Interventional Systems, Eschborn, Germany) was repeatedly performed, resulting in thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) III antegrade flow to the right hand, promptly filling of the palmar arch and retrograde filling of the ulnar artery. Pain and paresthesia immediately resolved without need for further pharmacological interventions. The patient was discharged without functional deficits of his right hand, and duplex sonography after 4 weeks and 6 months revealed triphasic flow of the brachial and radial arteries and retrograde flow of the ulnar artery."

    "abstract": "The treatment of patients with acute back pain is becoming increasingly more important due to the high incidence; however, acute clinical pictures from other disciplines can also primarily be symptomatic with back pain and falsely lead to a consultation with an orthopedist. In order to assure an adequate treatment of potentially critical patients, it is absolutely necessary to exclude life-threatening differential diagnoses by a structured study of the patient history, investigations and diagnostics. Depending on the suspected diagnosis, necessary first aid measures and emergency referral to the appropriate specialist department should be initiated. This article gives an overview of selected clinical pictures and tries to look beyond the field of orthopedics."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to report the outcome of immediate and direct revascularization by mechanical thrombectomy in acute limb ischemia due to thrombosed popliteal artery aneurysm (PAA). Two patients with acute limb ischemia due to PAA thrombosis were admitted at our hospital, and immediately treated by mechanical thrombectomy (Indigo System). The first patient had a complete recanalization after thrombectomy, while the second one required urokinase infusion (12 hr) due to a suboptimal result. After revascularization, both patients were treated by a polytetrafluoroethylene bypass to definitively exclude PAA. Follow-up showed the patency of the femoropopliteal bypass with good distal outflow. In these 2 reported cases, the Indigo System® has proven to be safe and effective, allowing an immediate limb reperfusion, reducing the necessity for thrombolytic drug infusion."

    "abstract": "Coral reef aorta (CRA) is a rare condition featured by rock-hard calcifications that grow into the lumen of the thoracoabdominal aorta. Patients suffering from CRA may present severe downstream ischemic and embolic events involving the viscera and the lower limbs. In these patients, open surgical repair is the first choice of treatment. We present a case of a 70-year-old woman with acute presentation of bilateral limb ischemia and abdominal pain. An angio-computed tomography (CT) scan showed the subocclusion of the distal thoracic aorta due to a severe calcified coarctation with intraluminal thrombosis, a chronic occlusion of the superior mesenteric and celiac trunk arteries, a hypertrophic inferior mesenteric artery associated with signs of partial left kidney ischemia. The patient underwent urgent endovascular repair. A soft dilatation of the coarctation using a 7-mm noncompliant balloon was initially performed; a 21-mm conformable thoracic stent graft was subsequently deployed and increasingly dilated using progressively larger angioplasty balloons. The procedure was uneventful and the aortic gradient was reduced to zero. A postoperative CT scan revealed the proper deployment of the graft with no residual stenosis. Endovascular approach with the covered thoracic stent graft could be an accurate technique to treat CRA in the emergency setting. It allows for a primary protected balloon angioplasty and, in case of aortic-graft recoiling, a subsequent placement of covered or uncovered balloon-expandable stent graft can be safely and easily performed."

    "abstract": "Extremity tourniquet (TNK) application is an effective means of achieving compressible hemorrhage control in the emergency prehospital and clinical trauma setting. Modern United States military medical doctrine recommends TNK use to prevent lethal hemorrhage from extremity injury, followed by systemic prophylactic antibiotics to prevent wound infection. Because tissue pharmacokinetics of prophylactic antimicrobials during and after TNK-induced limb ischemia are largely unknown, this study was conducted to empirically determine the relationship between TNK application time and soft tissue antibiotic exposure in order to guide medical personnel in the management of extremity trauma. Hind limbs of anesthetized male Sprague Dawley rats were exsanguinated, and ischemia maintained by a pneumatic cuff placed at the level of the mid femur on one limb; the non-ischemic contralateral limb served as comparison tissue. Systemic prophylactic antibiotics (cefazolin, moxifloxacin, or ertapenem) were administered intravenously before or after TNK release following 2 or 4 h of ischemia with subsequent re-dosing every 12 h for 3 days. Free antibiotic in the interstitial fluid (ISF) of the tibialis anterior muscle of both hind limbs was recovered via microdialysis during ischemia and over three periods during reperfusion: immediately following TNK release, at 24 h post TNK release, and at 72 h post TNK release. Plasma and ISF free drug concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Tourniquet application prevented delivery of prophylactic antibiotics into distal soft tissue for the duration of ischemia, and caused a profound reduction in skeletal muscle drug exposure for up to 72 h following TNK release. A progressive decline in tissue antibiotic exposure during reperfusion was observed as TNK times increased from 2 h to 4 h. The timing and severity of reduced drug distribution in post-ischemic skeletal muscle varied substantially among the three antibiotic classes evaluated. Prolonged tourniquet application can significantly reduce distribution of prophylactic antibiotics into soft tissue during and after ischemia, potentially impairing prophylaxis of extremity wound infection. Our findings support the examination of alternative approaches to wound infection prophylaxis under conditions of delayed casualty evacuation when occlusive hemorrhage control measures are utilized."

    "abstract": "Missile embolism (ME) is a rare condition and was seen in 0.3% of gunshot wounds during the Vietnam War. It was first reported by Thomas Davis in 1834. ME occurs when a small caliber, slow velocity projectile penetrates a wall in the vasculature; loses its kinetic energy; and gets carried away along the bloodstream to occlude another vessel at a distant site. Civilian victims of low-velocity bullets account for 60% of such cases. ME can be arterial, venous, or paradoxical. Systemic arterial embolization accounts for 80% of published reports and occurs after the projectile penetrates the left chambers of heart, aorta, or very rarely pulmonary veins (PVs). There are only nine published reports of ME through PV till date. We report here, embolism of an air-gun pellet entering through the right thorax, into right PV, embolizing into right femoral artery, causing acute limb ischemia, in a young male. Emergency arteriotomy and removal of the embolic pellet saved the limb with good recovery. He did not require a thoracotomy. The clinical picture, radiological findings, operative details, and the management are presented and discussed with relevant literature. The purpose of this report is to highlight the unique presentation of ME through PV, as its management is different from other cases of arterial ME. Early diagnosis of the condition is imperative to prevent permanent ischemic damage of end organ and its sequelae. We present an analysis of all published reports of systemic ME through PV and also give our recommendations for its management."

In ALI, which is commonly caused by embolism or traumatic occlusion, symptoms appear quickly due to a lack of collateral blood flow and extension of the thrombus to arterial outflow. In cases with ALI presentation, urgent evaluation and management are necessary. Here, we report 3 cases with ALI due to thromboembolism. Conventional open thromboembolectomy was performed with a femoral artery cutdown and antegrade passage of the embolectomy catheter. Further, distal access was created in the dorsalis pedis artery and/or posterior tibial artery at the ankle level. After the retrograde passage of the guidewire and antegrade insertion of the embolectomy catheter, the embolus was completely removed."

However, presentation with complete occlusion of the aorta is uncommon. We report an 18-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with features of acute bilateral limb ischemia. Arterial Doppler ultrasonography showed infrarenal aortic occlusion. A bedside cardiac ultrasound was done in the emergency department which clinched the diagnosis of atrial myxoma. Complete surgical excision of the tumor and subsequent histopathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of atrial myxoma. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: This report puts emphasis on the fact that atrial myxoma, though rare, may be considered as a source of embolism in patients presenting with acute limb ischemia.

Post rupture cardiac hydatid there is disseminated echinococcosis in the body. We report a healthy 20-year old male, while he was working as a farmer who presented with sudden onset acute right lower limb ischemia caused by ruptured of primary hydatid cyst of the heart which managed as a surgical emergency. Patients with a cardiac hydatid cyst usually have symptoms after its rupture. Hydatid cyst rupture into left-sided chambers may cause systemic emboli, like in our case which presented with emboli of right common iliac artery and later on the patient had cerebral hydatid. Cardiac hydatid cyst can have two extremes, either remain asymptomatic over long periods or be discovered after serious and even fatal complications. Acute limb ischemia should be considered as an extremely a rare cause of rupture cardiac hydatid in an endemic area of echinococcosis also, this case confirms the need for the evaluation of the patient well after ruptured cardiac hydatid for other sites of emboli like brain hydrated as in our patient."

    "title": "Current Treatment Options in Acute Limb Ischemia.",
    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia represents a clinical emergency with eventual limb loss and life-threatening consequences. It is characterized by a sudden decrease in limb perfusion. Acute ischemia is defined as a duration of symptoms for less than 14 days. Aging of the population increases the prevalence of acute limb ischemia. The two principal etiologies are arterial embolism and in situ thrombosis of an atherosclerotic artery. Immediate diagnosis, accurate assessment and urgent intervention when needed are crucial to save the limb and to prevent a major amputation. Delay in diagnosis and therapy may lead to irreversible ischemic damage. To assess the current treatment options in acute limb ischemia, this review is based on a selective literature search in PubMed representing the current state of research. Patients with acute limb ischemia should receive immediate anticoagulation. Treatment depends on the classification based on the degree of ischemia and limb viability. Especially acute (< 14 days symptom duration) Rutherford Categories IIa and IIb with marginally and immediately threatened limbs require definitive therapeutic intervention and are salvageable, if promptly revascularized. The current literature suggests that open surgical revascularization is more time effective then catheter-directed thrombolysis. However, with the advent of thrombolytic delivery systems and mechanical thrombectomy devices, treatment time can be minimized and successful utilization in patients with Category IIb (Rutherford Classification for Acute Limb Ischemia) has been reported with promising limb-salvage and survival rates. Large randomized studies are still missing, and guidelines suggest choosing the method of revascularization depending on anatomic location, etiology, and local practice patterns, with the time to restore the blood flow being an important factor to consider. · Acute limb ischemia is an interdisciplinary emergency. It can lead to limb loss with life-threatening consequences.. · Immediate diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent irreversible damage.. · An endovascular approach should be considered in acute limb ischemia Category IIa and IIb of the Rutherford Classification for Acute Limb Ischemia (< 14 days), on a case-based decision and local capabilities. Especially elderly, multimorbid patients with high perioperative risk (may probably) benefit from these minimally invasive procedures.. · Fluck F, Augustin A, Bley T et al. Current Treatment Options in Acute Limb Ischemia. Fortschr Röntgenstr 2020; 192: 319 - 326. Die akute Ischämie der unteren Extremität stellt einen klinischen Notfall mit möglichem Extremitätenverlust und lebensgefährlichen Folgen dar. Sie ist durch eine plötzliche Minderdurchblutung der Extremität gekennzeichnet. Definitionsgemäß weist die akute Ischämie eine Symptomdauer bis zu 14 Tagen auf. Die Prävalenz der akuten Extremitätenischämie ist durch die zunehmende Lebenserwartung in den letzten Jahren gestiegen. Die Thrombembolie und Lokalthrombose sind die häufigsten ätiologischen Faktoren. Ausschlaggebend für den Extremitätenerhalt ist die sofortige Diagnosestellung und Initiierung des therapeutischen Prozederes. Eine Verzögerung von Diagnose und Therapie kann zu irreversiblen ischämischen Schäden führen. Diese Übersichtsarbeit basiert auf einer selektiven Literaturrecherche in PubMed, die den aktuellen Forschungsstand repräsentiert. Patienten mit akuter Ischämie der unteren Extremität sollten umgehend antikoaguliert werden. Das weitere diagnostische und therapeutische Prozedere ist abhängig vom Schweregrad der Ischämie. Insbesondere die akuten (< 14 Tage Symptomdauer) Rutherford-Kategorien IIa und IIb mit marginaler und unmittelbarer Gefährdung der Extremitäten erfordern eine definitive therapeutische Intervention und sind im Falle einer prompten Revaskularisation beinerhaltend angehbar. Bislang galt die offen chirurgische Revaskularisation als zeiteffektiver im Vergleich zur lokalen Thrombolyse. Durch die Entwicklung neuer perkutaner mechanischer Katheterthrombektomie-Systeme ist die Behandlungszeit verkürzt und erfolgsversprechende Ergebnisse bezüglich Extremitätenerhalt und Überlebensraten wurden berichtet. Es fehlen randomisierte Studien und die Leitlinien empfehlen, die Methode der schnellstmöglichen Revaskularisation in Abhängigkeit von Lokalisation, Ätiologie und persönlicher Expertise zu wählen. · Die akute Ischämie der unteren Extremität ist ein interdisziplinärer Notfall. Er kann zum Extremitätenverlust führen und lebensbedrohliche Folgen haben.. · Sofortige Diagnosestellung und Therapieeinleitung sind entscheidend, um irreversible Schäden zu vermeiden.. · Der endovaskuläre Behandlungsansatz sollte in den Kategorien IIa und IIb nach der Rutherford-Klassifikation für akute Extremitätenischämie (< 14 Tage) erfolgen.

    "abstract": "Readmission to the hospital after revascularization for peripheral artery disease (PAD) is frequently reported. No consensus exists as to the exact frequency and risk factors for readmission. This review aimed to determine the incidence of and risk factors for 30-day readmission after revascularization for PAD. PubMed/Medline (Ovid), Scopus, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL were searched systematically from inception until May 20, 2018. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they included patients with diagnosed PAD undergoing revascularization and reported the readmission rate and a statistical evaluation of the association of at least one risk factor with readmission. Studies were excluded if data for other procedures could not be distinguished from revascularization. Two authors undertook study selection independently with the final inclusion decision resolved through consensus. The PRISMA and Meta-analyses of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines were followed regarding data extraction and quality assessment, which was performed by two authors independently. Data were pooled using a random effects model. The primary outcome was readmission within 30 days of revascularization. Fourteen publications reporting the outcomes of 526,008 patients were included. Reported readmission rates ranged from 10.9% to 30.0% with a mean of 16.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.1%-17.9%). Meta-analyses suggested the following risk factors had a significant association with readmission: female sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.13; 95% CI, 1.05-1.21), black race (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.28-1.46), dependent functional status (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.43-2.06), critical limb ischemia (OR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.72-2.62), emergency admission (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.43-2.15), hypertension (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.26-1.54), heart failure (OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.50-2.20), chronic pulmonary disease (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.08-1.32), diabetes (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.32-1.63), chronic kidney disease (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.62-2.31), dialysis dependence (OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.75-2.48), smoking (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.78-0.89), postoperative bleeding (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.23-2.35), and postoperative sepsis (OR, 4.13; 95% CI, 2.02-8.47). Approximately one in six patients undergoing revascularization for PAD are readmitted within 30 days of their procedure. This review identified multiple risk factors predisposing to readmission, which could potentially serve as a way to target interventions to reduce readmissions."

    "abstract": "Chronic critical limb ischemia (CLI) represents a clinical end stage of peripheral arterial disease. Many CLI patients are ineligible for conventional revascularization therapies; thus, it is urgent to explore an alternative strategy to rescue the ischemic limb. Recent stem cell studies have greatly developed the field of therapeutic angiogenesis, which aims to significantly improve the limb blood supply. In our study, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) served as the control to evaluate the function of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs) in enhancing angiogenesis. We compared gene expression between BMMSCs and UCMSCs, and a bioinformatics analysis indicated that both UCMSCs and BMMSCs could stimulate angiogenesis and angiogenesis-related factors were upregulated in UCMSCs. In vitro assays indicated that both BMMSCs and UCMSCs promoted human umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation, and the effects of UCMSCs were more obvious. Consistent with in vitro results, both UCMSCs and BMMSCs improved the limb blood supply in a mouse model of hind limb ischemia, in which UCMSCs promoted angiogenesis more significantly. Finally, we found that activation of ERK and PI3K-Akt pathways might be the mechanism by which UCMSCs promote angiogenesis. These results indicate that UCMSCs play an important role in therapeutic angiogenesis to improve limb blood perfusion."

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that more bypass outflow targets for bypass grafts improve patency and outcomes. Our objective was to examine this in a multicenter contemporary series of axillary to femoral artery grafts. The Vascular Quality Initiative database was queried for all axillary-unifemoral (AxUF) and axillary-bifemoral (AxBF) bypass grafts performed between 2010 and 2017 for claudication, rest pain, and tissue loss. Patients with acute limb ischemia were excluded. Patients' demographics and comorbidities as well as operative details and outcomes were recorded. Univariable, multivariable, and Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to assess long-term outcomes. There were 412 (32.9%) AxUF grafts and 839 (67.1%) AxBF grafts identified. Overall, the mean age of the patients was 68.3 years, 51.1% were male, and 84.7% were white. Compared with AxBF grafts, AxUF grafts were more often performed for urgent cases; in patients who were younger, male, nonambulatory, and diabetic; and in those with preoperative anticoagulation, critical limb ischemia, prior bypass, aneurysm repair, peripheral vascular intervention, and major amputation (P < .05 for all). There were no significant differences between AxUF and AxBF grafts in perioperative wound complications (4.2% vs 2.9%; P = .23), cardiac complications (7.3% vs 10.4%; P = .08), pulmonary complications (4.1% vs 6%, P = .18), early stenosis/occlusion (0.2% vs 0.8%; P = .22), perioperative mortality (2.9% vs 3.2%; P = .77), and length of stay (6.4 ± 5.6 days vs 6.7 ± 8 days; P = .29). The mean estimated blood loss (268.1 mL vs 348.6 mL; P < .001) and mean operative time (201 minutes vs 224.1 minutes; P < .001) were significantly lower for AxUF grafts. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that AxUF and AxBF grafts had similar freedom from graft occlusion (62.6% vs 71.8%; P = .074), major adverse limb event-free survival (57.1% vs 66.6%; P = .052), and survival (86% vs 86%; P = .897) at 1 year. Major amputation-free survival was lower for AxUF grafts (63.7% vs 73%; P = .028). Multivariable analysis also showed that the type of graft configuration did not independently predict occlusion/death (hazard ratio [HR], 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-1.46; P = .72), amputation/death (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.83-1.51; P = .45), major adverse limb event/death (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.73-1.3; P = .85), or mortality (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.65-1.26; P = .55). Three-year survival after placement of AxUF and AxBF grafts was similar (75.1% vs 78.2%; P = .414). AxUF and AxBF grafts have similar perioperative and 1-year outcomes. Graft patency was not significantly different between an AxBF graft and an AxUF graft at 1 year. Overall, patients treated with these reconstructions have many comorbidities and low long-term survival."

It was a retrospective study, extended over a period of 12years, going from 2007 to 2018, covering 26 patients operated on surgically for popliteal aneurysm. We have operated 26 patients for PAA. All patients were male. The average age was 59years [39-80years]. The aneurysm was symptomatic in 22 cases and asymptomatic in 4 cases. The mean aneurysm diameter was 37mm [26-70mm]. Twenty-two patients have received a planned surgery and we did emergency surgery for 4 patients because of a limb ischemia complication. The surgical treatment consisted in a surgical bypass after the aneurysm removing. The restoration of blood continuity was achieved by a vein graft in 23 cases and prosthetic in 3 cases. Three patients needed major amputation within 30days (11.53%) and no mortality was observed during this period. Mean follow-up was 24months [12-96months]. Two-years mortality, complication rate and limb salvage was respectively 7.69%, 15.38% and 84.62%. The PAA represents a serious disease that can affect the vitality of the lower limb.

Methods Retrospective analysis of data obtained from 100 patients' medical history in the period 2000-2016 at the Clinic of Vascular Surgery Sarajevo: group A - 60 patients with acute limb ischemia in the period 2005-2016 and group B - 40 patients with acute limb ischemia (ALI) in the period 2000-2005. From 2000 to 2005 conservative treatment method was used, invasive diagnostic and surgical procedures were often delayed for a shorter or longer period of time. During the period from 2005 to 2016, the management model and safe practice included emergency diagnostic procedures, colour-Doppler, arteriography, emergency surgery (embolectomy by Fogharty and if necessary, vascular by-pass). Results Better health service for the patients with acute limb ischemia was offered in the period 2005-2016, which relied on proven medical treatment trends. The largest share of the total costs of each patient included costs of hospital bed with significant difference between the period 2005-2016 and 2000-2005, mean of 1398.71 KM and 2480.45KM, respectively (p<0.0001), indicating rationalization of time that patients spend at the Vascular Clinic.

Many patients who undergo PFAs have concomitant comorbidities and generally present with a severe acute manifestation of the condition, such as gangrenous changes, systemic infection, or debilitating pain, which would then require emergency amputation on an inpatient basis. The purpose of this study was to track the recent prevalence of PFAs and to investigate the current demographic trends of the physicians managing and performing PFAs, specifically regarding medical degree and specialty. Doctors of podiatric medicine are striving to achieve parity with their allopathic and osteopathic surgical counterparts and become a more prominent part of the multidisciplinary approach to limb salvage and emergency surgical treatment. This study evaluated 4 years (2009-2012) of PFA data from the Pennsylvania state inpatient database in the two most populated areas of Pennsylvania: Philadelphia and Allegheny counties. Statistics on medical schools were obtained directly from the accrediting bodies of allopathic, osteopathic, and podiatric medical schools. The goal of this study was to evaluate the general trends of patients undergoing a PFA and to quantify the upswing of podiatric surgeons intervening in the surgical care of these patients. The number of partial foot amputations in the United States rose from 2006 to 2012. Podiatric surgeons performed 46% of theses procedures for residents of Philadelphia County from 2009 to 2012. In Allegheny County podiatric physicians performed 42% of these procedures during the same time frame. Partial foot amputations are increasing over time.

Femoral arterial access was established in 52 patients (73% percutaneously). Vascular complications were observed in 28,6% of the VA femoral ECMOs: 12 acute limb ischemias and 3 major hemorrhages. At the time of femoral cannulation, distal peripheral catheter (DPC) was placed in 5 patients and none developed limb ischemia. For those who developed limb ischemia, several interventions were performed: DPC placement in 9 cases, fasciotomy in 4 and 2 major amputations. Thirty patients underwent arterial cannulas open surgical removal: 8 underwent balloon catheter trombectomy and 5 needed femoral reconstruction. There was an association between PAD (p=0,03) and ischemic cardiopathy (p=0,02;OR 4,5) with the present of vascular complications after ECMO implantation. Cannulation of femoral vessels remains associated with considerable rates of vascular events (28.6%). PAD and ischemic cardiopathy are associated with vascular complications in this form of cannulation."

    "abstract": "Acute upper limb ischemia is a medical and surgical emergency. Studies that have reported revascularization results in acute upper limb ischemia are rare. For this reason, the revascularization delay has remained poorly defined. The purpose of this study was to evaluate surgery results of acute upper limb ischemia related to revascularization delay. We report a retrospective study of patients operated for acute upper limb ischemia between 2008 and 2016. Patients with thrombotic, traumatic or iatrogenic ischemia were excluded from this study. Patients were divided into two groups (those operated before 12hours and those operated after 12hours). A statistical analysis was performed to compare surgery results between the two groups in terms of limb salvage rate and neurological sequelae rate. Our population consisted of 138 patients. The average age was 69 [31,92]. There were 90 women and 48 men. The mean revascularization delay was 20hours [2,240]. Seventy-six patients were operated on before 12hours and 62 patients after 12hours. At one month, the mortality was 1.4% and the morbidity was 5.7%. The overall limb salvage rate was 86.9% and the overall neurologic sequelae rate was 31.8%. Statistical analysis showed that there was no significant difference between patients operated before or after 12hours in terms of limb salvage (86.8% versus 87%, P=0.258). However, there was a statistically significant difference in terms of neurological sequelae in favor of patients operated after 12hours (15.7% versus 51.6%, P=0.012). Revascularization of acute embolic upper limb ischemia is often associated with good results even if performed late. Beyond 12hours of ischemia, amputation rate is not significantly higher, however, the rate of neurological sequelae can be high."

    "abstract": "Background: To evaluate trends in frequency, mortality and treatment for non-traumatic vascular emergencies (VE) in the US. Methods: VE in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2005-2014) were identified. ICD-9 CM diagnosis and procedures codes captured six common VE. Results: 228,210,504 emergency admissions with 317,396 procedures for VE were estimated. Mean age was 67.8 years and were primarily men (56.1 %; p < 0.0001). The commonest VE was Acute Limb Ischemia (ALI) (82.4 %) followed by ruptured AAA (10.8 %) and Acute Mesenteric Ischemia (4.71 %). VE increased from 132.8 per 100,000 admissions in 2005 to 153.6 in 2014 (p < 0.001), with mortality decrease for all VE (13.8 % vs. 9.1 %; p < 0.0001). Length of stay decreased (median 8 vs. 7 days; p < 0.0001) but cost of care increased (median $ 25,443 vs. $ 29,353; p < 0.0001). Endovascular treatment increased overall for VE from 23.7 % in 2005 to 37.2 % in 2014 (p < 0.0001). Hospital mortality for VE decreased overall, except ruptured thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm with mortality decrease with endovascular treatment (34.3 vs. 11.1; p = 0.04) and mortality increase with open treatment (44.7 vs. 47.6; p = 0.06). ALI overall mortality decreased from 8.1 % to 5.7 % (p < 0.0001) due to reduced open surgical mortality from 9.6 % to 7.4 % (p < 0.0001); endovascular mortality did not improve over time (4.0 % vs. 3.4 %; p = 0.45). Hospital mortality also increased for endovascular treatment of ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysm (rTAA) from 14.9 % to 27.4 % (p = 0.0003) during this period. Conclusions: VE frequency increased with a decrease in overall mortality over time. Overall hospital stay has decreased but with an increase in the cost of care. Open surgical mortality for VE has also decreased overall, suggesting perioperative care improvements, with the exception of ruptured thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. Endovascular utilization for VE has significantly increased; associated with lower mortality for most VE, although an increase in hospital mortality after endovascular repair of rTAA was seen. This may be due to an increased implementation of endovascular repair for patients not previously eligible for surgery due to high risk. We recommend careful selection of patients for rTAA treatment as mortality has increased despite endovascular therapy and at an increased cost of care."

    "abstract": "Management of acute aortic intramural hematomas (IMHs) involving the ascending aorta and root remains controversial. Some series have suggested that delaying operative intervention beyond the first 24-hours may be beneficial. A retrospective single-institution analysis was performed to identify patients presenting with type A IMH. These patients were classified by whether they underwent surgery within 24 hours or delayed operative intervention. Patients with additional indications for emergent operation, such as acute aortic regurgitation or malperfusion syndromes, were excluded. Outcomes were assessed with logistic regression, and the Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze long-term survival. Of the 129 patients with acute type A aortic pathology, 36 (27.9%) presented with isolated IMH. IMH patients were less likely to present with acute aortic regurgitation (8.6% versus 27.9%, P = .020) or limb ischemia (0% versus 12.6%, P = .027). Of the IMH patients without other emergent operative indications, 23 (67.6%) underwent surgery within 24 hours. Delayed operative repair was not associated with increased risk of mortality, stroke, or renal failure (all P >.05). Survival analysis showed no difference in survival at 1 year. In well-selected patients, delayed operation for type An intramural hematoma is not associated with adverse outcomes."

    "abstract": "Noncardiac surgery early after coronary stenting has been associated with a high rate of stent thrombosis and catastrophic outcomes. However, those outcomes were mostly seen when dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) was discontinued before surgery. This observational study sought to estimate the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) after femoral artery repair following recent stent-percutaneous coronary intervention under continued DAPT and to explore potential risk factors. We suspect that in this setting, the risk of MACEs is lower than previously reported. This retrospective cohort study included all consecutive patients who underwent femoral artery repair because of puncture site complications (bleeding or occlusion) within 28 days after coronary stenting at a tertiary referral center in Switzerland from 2005 to 2015. The primary end point consisted of the MACEs death, cardiac arrest, stent thrombosis, and myocardial infarction. There were 12,960 patients who underwent coronary stenting. Seventy patients (0.5%) required repair of the femoral vessels, which was performed under continued DAPT in all cases. Eight patients (11.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.4-21.8) experienced a total of 17 MACEs within 30 days after surgery, including 5 deaths (7.1%; 95% CI, 2.7-16.6). Factors significantly associated with postoperative MACEs were cardiogenic shock on admission before coronary stenting (hazard ratio, 6.9; 95% CI, 1.8-29.6; P = .035) and limb ischemia as an indication for surgery compared with bleeding (hazard ratio, 10.5; 95% CI, 2.7-40.7; P = .008). In our series, femoral artery repair under DAPT for access site complications early after stent-percutaneous coronary intervention is associated with only a modest MACE rate and therefore a much better outcome than previously reported."

For decades, emergency thoracotomy or laparotomy and aortic cross clamping have remained the gold standard intervention. Recently, there has been a movement toward less invasive techniques for noncompressible hemorrhagic control, such as resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA). The REBOA technique involves inflation of an endovascular balloon within the abdominal aorta proximal to the vascular injury to temporarily inhibit bleeding. Although the literature is robust on this new technique, skepticism remains about whether REBOA is superior to aortic cross clamping, as it has been associated with complications including organ and limb ischemia, limb amputation, femoral aneurysm, and thrombosis."

    "abstract": "To analyze the long-term outcomes of a hybrid treatment method combining rotational atherectomy with drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty in patients with total in-stent occlusion in the iliac and/or infrainguinal arteries. Between April 2014 and June 2017, 74 consecutive patients (mean age 66.7±9.7 years; 49 men) with total occlusion of a previously implanted stent underwent endovascular recanalization using the Rotarex system and DCB angioplasty. Half (37, 50%) of the patients had critical limb ischemia (CLI), and 30 (41%) of the procedures were performed in emergency. Mean lesion length was 22±15 cm. Overall procedure success was achieved in 73 (98.6%) patients. Six (8.1%) CLI patients developed distal embolism that responded to thrombolysis. Three (4.1%) dissections did not require treatment, while 1 (1.4%) perforation necessitated stent-graft implantation. In all, 33 (44.6%) patients had an additional stent implanted, mainly due to a suboptimal outcome (n=28) or complications (n=5 including the stent-graft). The restenosis rate assessed by duplex ultrasound at 12 months was 20.5% (15/73); 4 (5.5%) patients underwent target lesion revascularization. Recurrent restenosis was more frequent in patients with Rutherford category 5 ischemia (p=0.005), in emergency procedures (p=0.021), after extensive procedures involving 3 independent vessel segments (p=0.016), and if a complication arose during the procedure (p<0.001). In multivariate analysis, only occurrence of a procedural complication was an independent predictor of recurrent restenosis at 1 year (OR 63.3, 95% CI 5.7 to 701.5). These findings imply that rotational atherectomy and DCB angioplasty may provide satisfactory outcomes in the treatment of total in-stent occlusion, with a satisfactory recurrent restenosis rate at 12 months."

    "abstract": "Wound healing is the physiologic response to a disruption in normal skin architecture and requires both spatial and temporal coordination of multiple cell types and cytokines. This complex process is prone to dysregulation secondary to local and systemic factors such as ischemia and diabetes that frequently lead to chronic wounds. Chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers are epidemic with great cost to the healthcare system as they heal poorly and recur frequently, creating an urgent need for new and advanced therapies. Stem cell therapy is emerging as a potential treatment for chronic wounds, and adult-derived stem cells are currently employed in several commercially available products; however, stem cell therapy is limited by the need for invasive harvesting techniques, immunogenicity, and limited cell survival in vivo. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) are an exciting cell type with enhanced therapeutic and translational potential. iPSC are derived from adult cells by in vitro induction of pluripotency, obviating the ethical dilemmas surrounding the use of embryonic stem cells; they are harvested non-invasively and can be transplanted autologously, reducing immune rejection; and iPSC are the only cell type capable of being differentiated into all of the cell types in healthy skin. This review focuses on the use of iPSC in animal models of wound healing including limb ischemia, as well as their limitations and methods aimed at improving iPSC safety profile in an effort to hasten translation to human studies."

    "abstract": "Physical exam and angiography have important roles in the diagnosis of traumatic lower extremity vascular injury with similar reported high rates of sensitivity and specificity. It has been previously shown that CTA is not universally indicated in the setting of acute lower extremity trauma when a reliable physical examination is obtained. As such, the purpose of this study was to determine if obtaining a CTA following physical examination altered the clinical care of patients following high-energy lower extremity trauma and the generalizability to the military population. Retrospective review of all patients who underwent lower extremity CTA during the initial trauma evaluation at a Level 1 Trauma Center from 2007 to 2014. One hundred and fifty-seven patients met inclusion criteria. One hundred and seventeen patient's initial physical exam excluded limb ischemia with 67 vascular injuries on CTA (9 underwent angiogram in the OR) with no reperfusions required. 40 patients had hard signs of ischemia or ABI's <0.90, 29 had injuries on CTA, and fifteen underwent a vascular reperfusion procedure for acute vascular injury. Ten of 15 reperfusions required no further angiography after CTA. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of physical exam for needed reperfusion were both 100%. There were no instances of missed vascular injury or readmission and 53 patients were discharged directly from the emergency room after a negative CTA. This study suggests that physical exam alone achieves a high sensitivity for vascular injury in lower extremity trauma. Physical exam excluded all lower extremity ischemia without the need for advanced imaging. While CTA was useful to confirm and localize the source of acute vascular injury, the majority of vascular injuries identified on CTA did not affect immediate clinical care and lead to additional unnecessary procedures. However, in patients with suspected vascular injury, a negative CTA was also used as rationale for immediate discharge from the emergency department without further clinical observation. When applied to the deployed military setting the results of this study support the use of physical exam to accurately diagnose limb threatening ischemia at the time of injury or Role 1 facilities with CTA reserved for diagnosing the level of the vascular injury and for potential patient clearance prior to prolonged evacuation."

Hybrid (HYB) surgery in the form of femorofemoral bypass and retrograde endovascular aortoiliac intervention is increasingly being used to achieve the same goal. This study compared the perioperative outcomes of HYB surgery with traditional surgery for bilateral inflow revascularization. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program files for the years 2012 to 2015 were reviewed, and all patients undergoing ABF bypass, AXBF bypass, and HYB surgery (femoral-femoral bypass and retrograde endovascular intervention) were included. Patients' demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes were compared between the three groups. A propensity-matched analysis was subsequently performed to compare HYB surgery with ABF bypass only. The χ2 test and analysis of variance with post hoc analysis were conducted to evaluate between-group differences in risk factors and outcomes. SPSS statistical software (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) was used. There were 1426 patients (ABF bypass, 976; AXBF bypass, 257; HYB surgery, 193). There were significant differences in the three populations of patients, with ABF bypass patients significantly more likely to have age <70 years (ABF bypass, 84.2%; AXBF bypass, 49.8%; HYB surgery, 58%; P < .001) and more likely to be independent (ABF bypass, 98%; AXBF bypass, 89.1%; HYB surgery, 93.2%; P < .001). Patients undergoing AXBF bypass were significantly more likely to be treated for critical limb ischemia (ABF bypass, 46.5%; AXBF bypass, 72.4%; HYB surgery, 51.8%; P < .001) under emergent conditions (ABF bypass, 0.9%; AXBF bypass, 5.1%; HYB surgery, 3.6%; P < .001). There was no difference in mortality between the three groups (P = .178). After propensity matching, a total of 571 patients with ABF bypass were compared with HYB surgery patients. HYB surgery patients had significantly less pneumonia (ABF bypass, 8.7%; HYB surgery, 1.6%; P < .001), unplanned intubation (ABF bypass, 7.7%; HYB surgery, 3.1%; P = .032), cardiac arrest (ABF bypass, 3.7%; HYB surgery, 0.5%; P = .025), transfusion (ABF bypass, 44.4%; HYB surgery, 18.1%; P < .001), and composite morbidity (ABF bypass, 55%; HYB surgery, 32.6%; P < .001). Patients undergoing ABF bypass had significantly higher mortality (ABF bypass, 4.2%; HYB surgery, 1%; P = .043) and 30-day reoperation (ABF bypass, 17.5%; HYB surgery, 9.3%; P = .009) and longer total hospital length of stay (ABF bypass, 9.79 ± 10.69 days; HYB surgery, 5.79 ± 9.72 days; P < .001). There was no difference in major amputation (P = .607) and readmission (P = .495) between the two groups. ABF bypass is the most common surgery for bilateral lower extremity revascularization in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database and continues to have good outcomes. In selected patients, HYB surgery was associated with improved perioperative, 30-day outcomes compared with ABF bypass."

Objectives were to review our experience with systematic initial axillary artery cannulation, characterize patients on the basis of cannulation site, and assess outcomes. From January 2000 to January 2017, 775 patients underwent emergency acute type A dissection repair. Initial axillary cannulation was performed in 617 (80%), femoral in 93 (12%), and central in 65 (8.4%). In-hospital mortality and stroke risk factors were identified using logistic regression. Reasons for selecting initial central or femoral instead of axillary cannulation included unsuitable axillary anatomy (n = 67; 42%), surgeon preference (n = 38; 24%), hemodynamic instability (n = 34; 22%), and preexisting cannulation (n = 19; 12%). Cannulation site was shifted or added intraoperatively in 82 (11%), with initial cannulation site being axillary (n = 23 of 617; 3.7%), central (6 of 65; 9.2%), or femoral (n = 53 of 93; 57%), for surgeon preference (n = 60; 73%), high flow resistance (n = 13; 16%), increased aortic false lumen flow (n = 6; 7.3%), and other (n = 3; 3.7%). In-hospital mortality was 8.6% (n = 67; lowest for axillary, 7.3% [P = .02]) and stroke 8.3% (n = 64). Hemodynamic instability (odds ratio [OR], 7.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.2-14), limb ischemia (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.5-9.3), stroke (OR, 5.5; 95% CI, 2.2-14), and aortic regurgitation (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-4.2) at presentation were risk factors for mortality and central cannulation site (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.05-5.1) and aortic stenosis (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2-4.6) for stroke. Systematic initial axillary cannulation for acute type A dissection repair is safe and effective and can be tailored to patients' specific needs. With this strategy, comparable outcomes are observed among cannulation sites and are largely determined according to patient presentation rather than cannulation site."

The Legflow is a new generation of DCB that has a homogenous, stable surface coating incorporating 0.1-µm paclitaxel particles. From January 2014 to June 2016, 139 patients (mean age 67.1±10.8 years; 109 men) were enrolled at 4 European institutions. Seventy-nine (56.8%) patients had claudication, while 60 (43.2%) had critical limb ischemia (CLI). Mean lesion length (MLL) was 90.0±41.2 mm. Eighty (57.6%) patients were treated for de novo lesions (MLL 83.2±41.2 mm), 29 (20.9%) for postangioplasty restenosis (MLL 81.2±30.9 mm), and 30 (21.6%) for in-stent restenosis (MLL 117.0±39.5 mm). The primary outcome measure was freedom from binary restenosis as determined by a peak systolic velocity ratio ≥2.4 on duplex or >50% stenosis on digital subtraction angiography at 12 months. The secondary outcome was freedom from clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR) at 12 months. Technical success was achieved in all the 139 treated patients. During the hospital stay, 3 CLI patients died of wound-related complications and 3 CLI patients underwent urgent TLR due to early occlusion in 2 and stent thrombosis in 1. At 12 months, 4 additional patients died of cardiac disease unrelated to the procedure. Of the 132 patients available for 1-year follow-up, the primary outcome (freedom from restenosis) was obtained in 107 (81.1%) patients. Freedom from CD-TLR was obtained in 110 (83.3%). Of the 25 late restenoses >50%, only 3 asymptomatic patients did not require TLR. Freedom from CD-TLR was higher in claudicants (87.0%) than in CLI patients (78.2%, p=0.20). In patients treated for in-stent restenosis, freedom from TLR at 1 year was 89.2%. These data suggest that the use of a new generation paclitaxel-coated balloon represents a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for femoropopliteal obstructions in different clinical and anatomical settings. These data will need to be confirmed with longer-term follow-up and in randomized controlled trials."

The sample of patients was split into two groups using the threshold of 15 ng/mL for the serum level of cotinine (low cotinine level - LCL vs. high cotinine level - HCL). Furthermore, the ROC analysis was conducted to identify the threshold of cotinine level able to discriminate between CLI patients with and without trophic lesions.Results: The mean age of patients was 60.7 ± 10.5 years with a significantly higher percentage of male patients (84%). A significant association was identified between urban origin and serum cotinine level, which is related to the increased number of cigarettes smoked per day among urban participants. Excepting necrectomy and toe disarticulation, no differences were found between LCL and HCL group regarding symptoms, signs or comorbidities. In smokers with CLI (38/43), a serum cotinine cut-off of 9.765 ng/mL was observed on eight out of 10 CLI patients with necrectomy and five out of 28 patients without necrectomy.Conclusion: Our study showed higher serum cotinine levels associated with a higher number of smoked cigarettes and necrectomy in patients with CLI. The serum cotinine could be a fair screening test for necrectomy in smokers CLI patients."

Complete or even partial occlusion of the arterial supply to a limb can lead to rapid ischemia and poor functional outcomes within hours. In human echinococcosis cardiac involvement is a rare presentation, it may lead to life-threatening complications including cyst rupture; anaphylactic shock; tamponade; pulmonary, cerebral or peripheral arterial embolism. Cardiac hydatid cyst (CHC) may have different presentation include acute lower limb ischemia secondary to embolization from a ruptured cyst. We report an 18-year old male healthy building worker while he was working who presented with sudden onset acute right lower limb pain and paresthesia caused by rupture of primary CHC which managed as a surgical emergency. Clinical presentation of ruptured of CHC depends on the specific location of the ruptured cyst that interferes and mobilization of daughter cyst that logged in vascular system with the function of the surrounding cardiac structures like our case that present with embolization of daughter cyst into the right external iliac artery which leads to acute limb ischemia. Cardiac hydatid cyst is a rare finding with a wide range of signs and symptoms. We are reporting this case to underline that cardiac hydatidosis should be considered as a differential diagnosis in young patients who suddenly develop acute limb ischaemic without a history of both cardiac diseases and trauma that lives in endemic regions of hydatidosis."

    "abstract": "The surgical procedures due to aortoiliac aneurysm (AAA) represent the most demanding procedures in conventional vascular surgery. This is due, among other things, to the relatively frequent systemic and surgical complications in polymorbid and often urgently operated patients. Surgical and vascular complications after resections of aortoiliac aneurysms are relatively common, and reintervention due to these complications is reported to range around 14%. Retrospective clinical study of a group of patients undergoing surgical management for aortoiliac aneurysms in the period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2017 at the Department of Vascular and Plastic Surgery of Pardubice Hospital NPK. In a group of 240 patients (205 males, 35 females), mortality reached a total of 10.4%, with mortality in elective cases 3.4% and 31.1% in urgent procedures (37.5% in AAA rupture). Overall, in the elective group, we recorded a total of 29 (16.2%) surgical and/or vascular complications with the necessity of 16 (8.9%) surgical, endovascular or combined interventions. In the emergency group, these complications were recorded 30 times (49%) with the need for intervention in 19 cases (31.1% of emergency procedures). Open surgical procedures on AAA are accompanied by a high incidence of systemic and surgical and/or vascular complications. These patients therefore require high attention and quality of intensive care in the postoperative period, focusing on early diagnosis and subsequent treatment of these complications. Key words: aortoiliac aneurysm surgical complications - bleeding limb ischemia abdominal compartment syndrome."

    "title": "Acute Limb Ischemia.",
    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is a rapid decrease in lower limb blood flow due to acute occlusion of peripheral artery or bypass graft, and in ALI not only limbs but also life prognosis will be poor unless quick and appropriate treatment is given. The etiology is broadly divided into embolism and thrombosis with various comorbidities. The symptoms of ALI are abrupt with pain, numbness, and coldness of lower limb, and paresthesia, contracture, and irreversible purpura will appear with the exacerbation of ischemia. Severity and treatment strategy should be determined based on physical findings and image findings. Considering life prognosis, limb amputation should be done without hesitation when the limb was diagnosed as irreversible. ALI can be treated by means of open surgical revascularization, endovascular, or hybrid approach with rapid systemic administration of heparin. In any cases, evaluating the lesions by intraoperative angiography and appropriate additional treatment are important. ALI is a serious disease requiring urgent treatment, and it is essential to promptly perform the best initial treatment that can be performed at each facility.

    "title": "Urgent need to clarify the definition of chronic critical limb ischemia - a position paper from the European Society for Vascular Medicine.",
    "abstract": "Chronic critical lower limb ischemia (CLI) has been defined as ischemia that endangers the leg. An attempt was made to give a precise definition of CLI, based on clinical and hemodynamic data (Second European Consensus). CLI may be easily defined from a clinical point of view as rest pain of the distal foot or gangrene or ulceration. It is probably useful to add leg ulcers of other origin which do not heal because of severe ischemia, and to consider the impact of frailty on adverse outcome. From a hemodynamic viewpoint there is no consensus and most of the existing classifications are not based upon evidence. We should thus propose a definition and then validate it in a prospective cohort in order to define the patients at major risk of amputation, and also to define the categories of patients whose prognosis is improved by revascularisation. From today's available data, it seems clear that the patients with a systolic toe pressure (STP) below 30 mmHg must be revascularised whenever possible. However other patients with clinically suspected CLI and STP above 30 mmHg must be evaluated and treated in specialised vascular units and revascularisation has to be discussed on a case by case basis, taking into account other data such as the WiFi classification for ulcers.In conclusion, many useful but at times contradictory definitions of CLI have been suggested. Only a few have taken into account evidence, and none have been validated prospectively. This paper aims to address this and to give notice that a CLI registry within Europe will be set up to prospectively validate, or not, the previous and suggested definitions of CLI."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia (ALI), a subclass of critical limb ischemia, is a medical emergency. The cause of ALI is usually thrombotic or embolic in nature, and the specific etiology often dictates the appropriate therapy. While the diagnosis is a clinical with common presenting symptoms, advances in ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance technology have impacted the diagnosis and subsequent therapy. In ALI, the time to revascularization is critical and computed tomography angiography (CTA) provides a highly sensitive and specific technique for rapidly identifying occlusions and precisely defining vascular anatomy prior to interventions. In patients with significant renal disease, magnetic resonance angiography with or without contrast provides effective alternatives at the expense of imaging time. Treatment can include a variety of endovascular or surgical interventions, including thromboembolectomy, angioplasty, or bypass. Proper evaluation of the etiology of the ischemia, affected vasculature, and medical history is critical to select appropriate treatment and improve patient outcomes. Here, we examine the presentation, evaluation, and treatment of ALI and the role of CTA in diagnosis and therapy."

    "abstract": "The femoral prosthetic patch is a surgical procedure frequently used to treat atherosclerotic lesions involving femoral artery bifurcation. Even though it is an easy to perform procedure, surgical management of complications, first of all graft infection, may be challenging, with a high morbidity and mortality risk for patients. We report our experience on surgical treatment of femoral patch infections. Between April 2012 and April 2018, 26 patients (26 limbs) were referred to the emergency department at our institution for the treatment of femoral prosthetic patch infections. None of the patients had been previously treated at our institution. All patients underwent a wide debridement of the infection site. Blood flow was restored through a vein interposition graft anastomosed at least 4-5 cm from the site of infection. End points of the study were death-related events, major or minor limb loss (major loss for above or below the knee amputation and minor for foot or toe), vein interposition graft failures, recurrent graft infections, or surgical wound healing. A total of 26 patients (21 male and 5 female patients) underwent surgical treatment. The mean age of patients was 69 years. The majority of our patients (54%) had been previously treated with an isolated femoral artery prosthetic patch. Three (11%) patients had been treated with a bilateral prosthetic femoral patch, but only one side was infected. After debridement of the infection site, we used the great saphenous vein to revascularize the lower limb in 22 (85%) cases, whereas the cephalic vein was used in only 4 cases (15%). The 5-year survival rate was 81% (standard error [SE] = 0.12). The 5-year primary patency rate was 70% (SE = 0.14). During follow-up, 4 graft occlusions occurred, and in 2 cases, a major amputation was required. The limb salvage rate at 5 years was 81% (SE = 0.13). An infection can complicate the femoral prosthetic patch carrying a high rate of morbidity, mortality, and limb loss. Surgical indication for a primary procedure must be restricted to critical limb ischemia, and it must be associated to a multilevel correction of the atherosclerotic disease."

    "abstract": "A 69-year-old woman with a history of graft replacement for abdominal aortic aneurysm developed a complicated type B aortic dissection that resulted in renal malperfusion after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). The primary entry tear was formed at the aortic arch and the false lumen (FL) continued to the abdominal aorta. The distal end of the FL formed a pouch-like blind alley above the suture line of the bifurcated abdominal graft. The true lumen (TL) was compressed and caused severe limb ischemia. The right renal artery (rRA) originated from the FL. The patient had initially undergone emergent axillofemoral bypass for limb malperfusion. Three weeks later, restenosis of the TL caused visceral malperfusion, and a huge thrombus formed in the FL pouch. TEVAR expanded the TL and restored visceral vascularization. However, the expanded TL compressed the thrombus in the blind alley to the rRA orifice and caused right renal malperfusion. The history of abdominal graft replacement may have increased the risk of a thrombotic event after TEVAR. Primary TEVAR may have helped prevent thrombus formation in the FL pouch. <Learning objective: This case report describes visceral arterial embolism induced by endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for type B aortic dissection in a patient with prior abdominal aortic grafting. A huge thrombus formed in the blind pouch of the false lumen (FL) above the graft suture line. TEVAR expanded the true lumen and the FL thrombus occluded a visceral artery with FL origin. Post-graft replacement has a risk of thrombus formation in the FL pouch and thrombus compression in visceral arteries.>."

    "abstract": "A 72-year-old male with sudden onset pain and coldness in his left lower limb was referred to our hospital. An emergency angiography of the lower limbs demonstrated the cause of acute limb ischemia as a subsequent acute thromboembolism at the site of a narrowing anastomosis of femoral-popliteal bypass (FPB). In particular, the site of the narrowing anastomosis had already been fixed using a nitinol stent 4 years previously. We confirmed that the severe stent fracture resulted from misalignment. After local lysis therapy, we decided to deploy another nitinol stent to in-stent restenosis (ISR) lesion of the stent fracture. Final angiography confirmed full patency in FPB without flow delay. Additionally, to maintain the patency of arterial flow, we prescribed aspirin and warfarin. After 2 years of operation, his follow-up ankle-brachial pressure index on the left side remained 0.86 and no ischemic leg pain was observed to date. Stent-in-stent procedure using another nitinol stent for ISR treatment for the narrowing anastomosis in FPB indicated feasible and effective results. <Learning objective: Endovascular intervention for acute limb ischemia (ALI) is one of the most challenging cases. Physicians often come up against a problem as no-flow phenomenon after revascularization. Local lysis therapy has established its own position in ALI treatment. However, the effectiveness of various interventional treatments for ALI has not been clarified. This report highlights the potential of a combination of local lysis and intervention in achieving good outcomes in represented repetitive ALI.>."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia is a common vascular emergency requiring immediate intervention. Thrombolysis has been widely utilized for acute limb ischemia; the purpose of this study is to analyze contemporary trends, outcomes and complications of thrombolysis for acute limb ischemia. Patients were identified from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2003-2013) using ICD-9. Patients undergoing emergency thrombolysis for acute limb ischemia were evaluated. Three groups were analyzed: thrombolysis alone, thrombolysis and endovascular procedure (T+ENDO), and failed thrombolysis requiring open surgery (T+OPEN). A total of 162,240 patients with acute limb ischemia were estimated: 33,615 patients (20.7%) underwent thrombolysis as the initial treatment. Mean age was 66.2 ± 34.9 years with 54% male. The utilization of thrombolysis increased significantly during the study period (16.8-24.2%, p < 0.0001). The most common group was thrombolysis and endovascular procedure (40.7%), followed by thrombolysis alone (34.1%), and T+OPEN (25.2%). Thrombolysis and endovascular procedure increased significantly over time (31.6-47.8%, p < 0.0001) whereas thrombolysis alone and T+OPEN significantly decreased (39.6-28.6% and 28.7-23.6%, respectively, p < 0.0001). Overall mortality was 4.9%; thrombolysis and endovascular procedure compared to thrombolysis alone and T-OPEN had a lower mortality rate (3.2% vs. 6.1% and 5.9%, p < 0001). The overall stroke rate was 1.9%; thrombolysis alone had the highest stroke rate (3.0%, p < 0.0001) with thrombolysis and endovascular procedure the lowest (1.2%) and T+OPEN 1.7%. The highest amputation rate was T+OPEN (11.6%, p < 0.001) compared to thrombolysis and endovascular procedure (5.1%) and thrombolysis alone (5.3%). T+OPEN had the highest incidence of cardiac (5.5%), respiratory (7.3%) and renal complications (12.5%), pneumonia (4.0%), and fasciotomy (16.8%) (all p < 0.0001). Thrombolysis remains an effective treatment for acute limb ischemia with increased utilization over time. There was a significant increase in thrombolysis and endovascular procedure leading to improved outcomes. Thrombolysis alone carried the highest mortality and stroke rate, with T+OPEN associated with the highest amputation and complications. Although thrombolysis is effective, 25% of patients required an open procedure suggesting that patient selection for thrombolysis first instead of open surgery continues to be a clinical challenge."

    "abstract": "May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) is a rarely diagnosed vascular abnormality that typically presents in young adults. The anomaly arises from compression of the left common iliac vein between the right iliac artery anteriorly and the lumbar vertebral body posteriorly, resulting in lower extremity venous outflow obstruction and recurrent deep vein thromboses (DVTs). We report the case of a 24-year-old female with a long history of recurrent DVTs and pulmonary emboli (PE) despite full anticoagulation. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed findings consistent with MTS, and a left common iliac vein stent was placed. However, the patient continued to have DVTs while trialing several anticoagulation therapies, including rivaroxaban, enoxaparin, and warfarin. Eventually, the patient developed arterial thrombi resulting in critical limb ischemia, necessitating a right below knee amputation (BKA). One month status-post BKA, the patient was admitted for severe BKA stump pain secondary to infection and necrosis. She underwent BKA revision, but continued to experience pain post-operatively and was found to have new right common iliac artery, external iliac artery, and common femoral artery thrombosis in the setting of continued inpatient anticoagulation therapy with enoxaparin and aspirin. The patient returned to the operating room for emergent Fogarty thrombectomy, however, this was complicated by rupture of the balloon catheter secondary to migration of the left common iliac vein stent into the right common iliac artery lumen. A stent was placed in the right common iliac artery to shift the rogue vein stent, but the patient continued to have poor distal circulation of the BKA stump and eventually underwent an above knee amputation. Dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel in combination with enoxaparin were used to prevent in-stent thrombosis and future formation of arterial and venous thrombi. After the initiation of DAPT and enoxaparin, her clinical course was free of any further thromboembolic events. Clinicians should consider MTS in the differential diagnosis of younger adults presenting with recurrent DVTs or other unprovoked thromboembolic events. A two-pronged strategy of DAPT and anticoagulation was employed for successful prevention of thrombotic events."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia is a vascular emergency defined as a sudden decrease in limb perfusion associated with a risk of loss of viability of the affected extremity. Surgical treatment (Fogarty thromboembolectomy) is indicated only in suprainguinal occlusions. Other cases of acute and subacute limb ischemia should be managed percutaneously. Catheter-based treatment involves local thrombolysis and percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (PMT). There are several devices in use for PMT; of them, the Rotarex system appears to be the most useful. There are no randomized studies comparing thrombolysis and PMT. Only indirect comparison is possible. The immediate and long-term results of PMT using the Rotarex device are probably more favorable than those following thrombolysis. Particularly for older and polymorbid patients, it may be significant that PMT, in comparison with thrombolysis, can restore blood flow faster and in one session; no contraindications for PMT in contrast to potentially life-threatening complications in thrombolysis exist, and there is also no need for observation in intensive care unit after PMT. Hospital stay after PMT is shorter. There is only one exception when thrombolysis cannot be replaced by Rotarex PMT - in the case of crural arteries involvement - due to the catheter size. In our opinion, PMT is superior to thrombolysis in the treatment of acute and subacute limb ischemia. Thrombolysis should be considered only in special cases, e.g. in crural arteries occlusions or in failure of mechanical thrombectomy."

We assessed the safety and feasibility of RIC for AIS patients undergoing endovascular treatment (ET). We conducted a pilot study with patients with AIS who were suspected of having an emergent large-vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation and who were scheduled for ET within 6 hours of ictus. Four cycles of RIC were performed before recanalization, immediately following recanalization, and once daily for the subsequent 7 days. The primary outcome was any serious RIC-related adverse events. Twenty subjects, aged 66.1 ± 12.1 years, were recruited. No subject experienced serious RIC-related adverse events. The intracranial pressure, cranial perfusion pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, middle cerebral artery peak systolic flow velocity, and pulsatility index did not change significantly before, during, or after the limb ischemia (P > 0.1 for all). Of 80 cycles, 71 (89%) were completed before recanalization and 80 (100%) were completed immediately after recanalization; 444 of 560 cycles (78%) were completed within 7 days posttreatment. No patients had to stop RIC because it affected routine clinical managements. Six subjects (30%) experienced intracerebral hemorrhage, which was symptomatic in one case (5%). At the 3-month follow-up, 11 subjects (55%) had achieved functional independence, and two subjects (10%) died. RIC appears to be safe and feasible for patients with AIS undergoing ET. Investigations are urgently needed to determine the efficacy of RIC in this patient population."

Use of peripheral nerve blocks for below and above knee amputations is quite uncommon which provides better hemodynamic stability and pain management, especially in the very sick patients. The surgeries were successfully carried out under ultrasound-guided combined femoral and sciatic nerve blocks. All five patients obtained adequate level of block at the area of amputation. There were no complications related to anesthetic management. Patients remained hemodynamically stable and pain-free during surgery and postoperatively. Combined femoral-sciatic nerve block under ultrasound guidance is safe and satisfactory alternative anesthetic technique for such patients."

    "abstract": "Despite major advances in the contemporary management of peripheral arterial occlusive disease, acute ischemia of the lower limb is still characterized by an important morbidity, limb threat, and mortality, and continues to pose a challenge to the vascular surgeon. Ageing of the population increases the prevalence of acute lower limb ischemia. The two principal etiologies of acute ischemia of the lower limbs are arterial embolism and in situ thrombosis of an atherosclerotic artery or of a bypass graft. Popliteal aneurysm thrombosis and vascular trauma are less common causes of severe limb ischemia. Prompt recognition and treatment of acute limb ischemia in an urgent setting are crucial, in order to shorten as much as possible the duration of the ischemia. This paper highlights diagnostic work-up (staging of the severity of ischemia) and appropriate management of acute ischemia of the lower limb. Different procedures of revascularization (operative clot removal, catheter-directed thrombolysis, bypass grafting are evaluated and their outcome results are compared.

Fifteen patients had Rutherford category 5 ischemia, and all patients had moderate to severe below-the-knee arterial calcification. Patients were treated with the Shockwave Medical Peripheral IVL System and followed for 30 days. The primary safety endpoint was a composite of major adverse events through 30 days defined as death, myocardial infarction, need for emergency surgical revascularization of the target limb, or amputation of the target limb. The primary effectiveness outcome was acute reduction in the percent diameter stenosis. IVL catheter delivery was successful in 19 patients. The composite of major adverse events at 30 days was 0%. The acute reduction in percent diameter stenosis of target lesions was 46.5%. All patients achieved residual diameter stenosis ≤50%. Vascular complications were minimal with only 1 type B dissection reported and 2 stents placed.

    "abstract": "Treatment of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAAs) is still burdened by high morbidity and mortality. Although endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) offers encouraging results in elective setting, its role as first-line strategy to treat rAAA is still debated. Our aim was to compare early and late outcomes in patients undergoing open surgical repair (OSR) versus EVAR for rAAAs. A retrospective review of data extracted from medical records identified 105 consecutive patients with rAAA who were submitted to open or endovascular repairs from 2008 to 2016. The primary end point was to assess the rAAA-related mortality in the immediate postoperative period, within 1 month and 1 year after OSR, and EVAR; secondary endpoints included the following: length of stay, AAA-related postoperative complications such as acute limb ischemia, myocardial infarction, renal and respiratory failure, and rAAA-related re-interventions. Statistical analysis was performed using the Fisher exact test, χ2 test, and logistic regression calculations. Early and midterm survival rates were assessed with Cox model. Of the 105 patients with rAAA, 70.48% underwent OSR including 41.89% which was hemodynamically (Hd) unstable and the remaining 29.52% was submitted to rEVAR. (all Hd stable). Compared with EVAR group, the OSR group had a higher rAAA-related mortality rate for both Hd stable and Hd unstable patients: 18.92% vs. 6.45% at 24 hr; (P = 0.185) 39.19% vs. 19.35% at 30 days (P = 0.082); 44.59% vs. 38.71% at 1 year (P = 0.734) If only Hd stable patients were considered, mortality following OSR and EVAR was as follows: 6.98% vs. 6.45% at 24 hr (P = 0.703); 27.91% vs. 19.35% at 30 days (P = 0.567); 32.56% vs. 38.71% at 1 year (P = 0.764). Mean length of stay for patients was 15 days after OSR and 10 days after rEVAR (P = 0.002). At 1-year follow-up, the overall rAAA-related complications incidence was higher in the rEVAR group than that in the OSR group (47.85% vs. 18.33%; P = 0.008); re-interventions were 18.33% in OSR group vs. 21.82% in EVAR group (P = 0.917). Cox model showed that instability and coronary artery disease were predictors of overall mortality of rAAAs. EVAR does not independently reduce 1-year mortality in comparison with OSR in Hd stable patients. Urgent EVAR for rAAAs in unstable patients can be limited by logistical problems. It follows that patients selected for OSR have a more complex aortic anatomy and worse Hd status than those submitted to rEVAR. rEVAR burdened by a higher incidence of procedure-related complications than OSR. Reconfiguration of acute aortic services and establishment of standardized institutional protocols might be advisable for improvements in the management of ruptured AAA. A careful evaluation of whether the benefits of an endovascular strategy translate into long term benefit is needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn about the advantages of EVAR as first-line strategy for ruptured aneurysms."

CTOs are frequent among patients with severe claudication or critical limb ischemia. Failure to recanalize CTOs remains common and is associated with poor prognosis. The SoundBite™ Crossing System (SoundBite Medical Solutions Inc., Montreal, QC, Canada) is a newly developed device that uses a 0.018-inch wire (SoundBite™ Active Wire) to deliver acoustic shock waves to the distal tip of a steerable guidewire to facilitate directed penetration of the proximal cap and crossing of the occlusion. Symptomatic patients with de novo infrainguinal CTOs from 3 centers were enrolled in a prospective, single-arm feasibility study. The primary endpoint was 30-day device success defined as composite of technical success, defined as penetration and progression within the CTO with the SoundBite™ Active Wire followed by complete recanalization, and freedom from device-related major adverse events including death, urgent amputation, clinically-driven target vessel revascularization, perforation, type ≥C dissection, or distal embolization requiring intervention. Thirty-seven patients including 41 CTO lesions were enrolled in this study. CTO length ranged from 10 mm to 270 mm (mean 97.9±77.4 mm), and moderate-to-severe calcification was present in 24 (58.5%) of the treated lesions. CTOs were successfully crossed in 34 (91.9%) patients. No device-related adverse events occurred, resulting in a 30-day device success rate of 91.9%. Compared with baseline, 30-day ankle brachial index (0.66±0.24 versus 0.89±0.20; P<0.001) and Rutherford class (3 [2, 4] versus 0 [0, 1], P<0.001) significantly improved.

There were 317 patients identified who underwent infrainguinal LEB for CLI. Average age was 66 years, and 60.6% of patients were male. Within 30 and 90 days, 24.3% and 36.3% presented to the ED overall, and 16.7% and 26.5% of all postoperative patients had an ED presentation without hospital admission, respectively. Most common reasons for any ED visits and for ED visits without admission within 30 days were wound complications (22.1% and 20.8%), cardiac complications (16.9% and 17%), and ipsilateral leg pain (10.4% and 11.3%), respectively. Cryopreserved vein bypass (odds ratio [OR] 3.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-8.84, P = 0.046) and index length of stay (LOS) (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.04-1.15, P < 0.001) predicted any 30-day ED visit. Active leg infection at the time of bypass (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.21-4.58, P = 0.012) and index LOS (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.004-1.09, P = 0.033) predicted 30-day ED presentation without hospital admission. Most common reasons for any ED visit and for ED visits without admission within 90 days were surgical wound complications (15.8% and 14.3%), cardiac complications (14.9% and 14.3%), and nonsurgical wounds (9.6% and 9.5%), respectively. Chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) (OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.52-4.93, P = 0.001) and index LOS (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.12, P = 0.017) predicted any 90-day ED visit. CRI (OR 3.34, 95% CI 1.81-6.17, P = 0.001) predicted 90-day ED presentation without hospital admission. For multiple ED visits within 90 days, there were 5 patients each with 5 ED visits, 12 each with 4 ED visits, 26 each with 3 ED visits, and 47 each with 2 ED visits. There is a high rate of ED utilization in CLI patients after LEB. Targeting these patients with closer follow-up and improved outpatient ambulatory access could assist in decreasing the frequency of postoperative ED visits. Particular areas of targeted improvement are those patients who presented to the ED and were not admitted."

    "title": "Cost Analysis of Initial Treatment With Endovascular Revascularization, Open Surgery, or Primary Major Amputation in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease.",
    "abstract": "To compare the total initial treatment costs for open surgery, endovascular revascularization, and primary major amputation within a single-payer healthcare system. A multicenter, retrospective analysis was undertaken to evaluate 1138 patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) who underwent 1017 endovascular procedures, 86 open surgeries, and 35 major amputations between 2013 and 2016. A cost-mix analysis was performed on individual patient data generated for selected diagnosis-related groups. Mean costs are presented with the 95% confidence interval (CI). There was no intergroup difference in demographics or private health insurance status. However, the amputation group had a higher proportion of emergency procedures (68.6% vs 13.3% vs 27.9%, p<0.001) and critical limb ischemia (88.6% vs 35.9% vs 37.2%, p<0.001) compared with the endovascular therapy and open surgery groups, respectively. The endovascular revascularization group spent less time in hospital and used fewer intensive care unit (ICU) resources compared with the open surgery and major amputation groups (hospital length of stay: 3.4 vs 10.0 vs 20.2 days, p<0.01; ICU: 2.4 vs 22.6 vs 54.6 hours, p<0.01), respectively. While mean prosthetic and device costs were higher in the endovascular group [AUD$2770 vs AUD$1658 (open) and AUD$1219 (amputation), p<0.01], substantial disparities were observed in costs associated with longer operating theater times, length of stay, and ICU utilization, which resulted in significantly higher costs in the open and amputation groups. After adjusting for confounders, the AUD$18,396 (95% CI AUD$16,436 to AUD$20,356) mean cost per admission for the endovascular revascularization group was significantly less (p<0.001) than the open surgery (AUD$31,908, 95% CI AUD$28,285 to AUD$35,530) and major amputation groups (AUD$43,033, 95% CI AUD$37,706 to AUD$48,361). Endovascular revascularization procedures for PAD cost the health payer less compared with open surgery and primary amputation. While devices used to deliver contemporary endovascular therapy are more expensive, the reduction in bed days, ICU utilization, and related hospital resources results in a significantly lower mean total cost per admission for the initial treatment."

    "abstract": "Phlegmasia cerulea dolens (PCD) is a rare complication of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Massive ileo-femoral DVT is usually the cause and prompt treatment is mandatory as it represents a medical emergency. Reported amputation rates range from 12% to 25% and mortality ranges from 25% to 40%. Limb ischemia results from obstruction to arterial inflow secondary to extreme levels of venous hypertension. Primary treatment goal is restoration of venous outflow and can be achieved by endovascular or surgical techniques. After thrombus removal an underlying iliac vein stenosis may be present. May-Thurner syndrome, a condition where the left common iliac vein is compressed by the right iliac artery, is the most prevelant iliac stenotic lesion. We report a case of a 57 years-old male, smoker, with no significant medical history, who presented to the emergency department with excruciating sudden left limb pain and swelling, with no trauma history, with a 2-hour onset. On physical examination he showed significant edema, purplish discoloration of the entire leg and absent dorsalis pedis artery pulse. Hipocoagulation with intravenous heparin was immediately initiated and emergent surgical venous thrombectomy was performed associated with direct intravenous fibrinolytic agent injection. Postprocedure phlebography showed a left common iliac vein lesion which was treated with angioplasty and venous stent placement. Pain, edema and coloration improved markedly after procedure without any complications. The patient was discharged home with anticoagulation treatment and compression stocking. Endovascular approaches such as catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) or pharmacomecanical thrombolysis (PMT) are becoming the treatment of choice to achieve venous outflow in DVT. In cases of PCD, when rapid restauration of venous outflow is mandatory, CDT has the disadvantage of having a long mean treatment time. This way, surgical thrombectomy still plays an important role in cases of PCD, especially if PMT is not available. In our case, the combined used of surgical thrombectomy with direct intravenous thrombolytic infusion provided effective treatment of PCD and uncovered an underlying left common iliac vein stenosis, which was successfully managed by angioplasty and stenting."

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) implies the identification of antiphospoholipid antibodies and arterial/venous thrombosis or pregnancy loss. During pregnancy, there is an increased risk of thrombotic complications. Present a case of acute lower limb ischemia in a patient with APS during postpartum period Materials/ Methods: review of a clinical case and available literature Results: Patient diagnosed with APS (triple antibody positive and antecedent of 3 previous abortions) underwent cesarean at 29 weeks of gestation. She was medicated with aspirin 00mg/day and enoxaparin 60mg/day and had discharge on the second postoperative day. After 3 days she came to the emergency department with acute limb ischemia. AngioCT revealed thrombosis of the right iliac axis and pulmonary thromboembolism. Endovenous hypocoagulation with unfractionated heparin was immediately started. Due to the high thrombotic risk associated with any type of surgical intervention and improvement of ischemia with hypocoagulation, it was decided to postpone surgical revascularization. At the 10th day of hospitalization angioCT was repeated with maintenance of the iliac thrombosis and clinically the patient had severe claudication and ankle-arm index of 0.26. On the 16th day of hospitalization (after 5 plasmapheresis sessions), she was submitted to trans-femoral thrombectomy, with a good femoral pulse at the end of the procedure. On the 3rd postoperative day we detected pulse loss and angioCT confirmed re-thrombosis of the iliac axis and an oclusion of the popliteal artery. A new attempt at revascularization was made and a new transfemoral thrombectomy was performed, with immediate pulse recovery. We performed intraoperative angiography that confirmed occlusion of the popliteal artery and we proceeded trans-popliteal thrombectomy. Intraoperative control angiography revealed permeability of ilio- -femoro-popliteal axes with some defects of filling of the crural arteries (anterior tibial and peroneal arteries). After the procedure the patient become assymptomatic, with an ankle-arm index of 0.55 (with normal flow in femoral and popliteal artery but monophasyc flow in distal arteries) and had discharged medicated with aspirin, antivitaminik K and corticoid. The beneficial/risk of revascularization surgery should be well considered as well as the timing in which it should be performed. Plasmapheresis is important to minimize the thrombotic risk associated with the surgical procedure. Intra-operative angiography is essencial since arterial thrombosis can occur in several sectors, which can conditionate the success of revascularization procedure."

    "abstract": "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been evolved as a life-saving measure for patients requiring emergent support of respiratory and cardiac function.The femoral artery is the standard site for vascular access when initiating adult venoarterial (VA) ECMO.Cannulation-related complications are a known source of morbidity and it has been speculated that patients undergoing ECMO via femoral arterial cannulation are more likely to develop peripheral vascular complications (up to 70%). In patients with severe peripheral arterial disease (PAD) these risks are even higher and its presence may be considered a relative contraindication for femoral artery cannulation. Retrospective institutional review of patients requiring ECMO (January 2011-August 2017).The primary outcome of this study was to investigate the prevalence of cannulation- -related complications on VA ECMO and to determine its effect on patient morbimortality.We evaluated demographics and co-morbidities data.Patients were divided into two groups (complications present VS not present) and statistic analysis was performed to determine the impact of different variables such as co-morbidities,cannulation strategy and time on ECMO in each group.Operative reports were reviewed to analyze the surgical procedures implied for treating vascular complications. Eighty-two patients underwent ECMO therapy during the period of study, 56,1% were male with a mean age of 55,8 years.The median time on the ECMO device was 5,5 days.The VA mode was used in 61 patients, 56 with peripheral cannulation.Femoral arterial access was established in 52 patients (73% percutaneously).Vascular complications were observed in 28,6% of the VA femoral ECMOs:12 acute limb ischemias and 3 major hemorrhages. At the time of femoral cannulation, distal peripheral catheter (DPC) was placed in 5 patients and none developed subsequent limb ischemia.For those who developed limb ischemia, several interventions were performed: DPC placement in 9 cases, fasciotomy in 4 and 2 major amputations. Thirty patients underwent arterial cannulas open surgical removal:8 underwent balloon catheter trombectomy and 5 needed femoral reconstruction.There was an association between PAD (p=0,03) and ischemic cardiopathy (p=0,02;OR 4,5) with the present of vascular complications after ECMO implantation.VA femoral ECMO mortality was 69,2% (n=36).Vascular complications after ECMO support are not associated with higher mortality rates (p>0,05). Cannulation of femoral vessels remains associated with considerable rates of vascular events (28.6%).PAD and ischemic cardiopathy are associated with vascular complications in this form of cannulation.Physical examination and the assessment of ankle-brachial índex before ECMO implantation is therefore recommended.Improved efforts at preventing these complications need to be developed to avoid additional morbidity in an already critical patient population."

    "title": "[Ruptures of popliteal artery aneurysms].",
    "abstract": "To improve diagnosis and surgical outcomes in patients with ruptured popliteal artery aneurysm. Eight patients with ruptured popliteal artery aneurysm have undergone surgery for the period from 1999 to 2015 at the Vascular Surgery Department of Sklifosovsky Research Institute for Emergency Care. Incidence of rupture was 2.9% from total number of popliteal artery aneurysm. 7 patients with rupture had signs of lower limb ischemia (acute form grade I in 2 (25%) cases, grade IIA in 1 (12.5%), grade IIB in 1 (12.5%) case, chronic ischemia grade IIB in 2 (25%) patients, grade III in 1 (12.5%) patient). 1 (12,5%) patient had not lower limb ischemia. Preoperatively all patients underwent sonography of lower limb arteries and soft tissues, computed tomography of the same structures was carried out in 3 patients, 5 patients underwent subtraction digital angiography. Presence and dimensions of soft tissues hematoma, arterial perfusion proximally and distally to popliteal artery, aneurysms of contralateral limb and other localizations were assessed. Amputations after surgical repair were absent in 6 patients. Five patients were discharged with patent graft, completely compensated blood flow and primary healing of postoperative wound. Severe postoperative complications followed by amputation occurred in 2 patients. One patient died with reperfusion syndrome, hematoma and graft infection, sepsis. 1) Ruptured popliteal artery aneurysm is extremely rare complication, however it is a formidable event with high risk of amputation and death. 2) Early diagnosis of popliteal artery aneurysm and surgical treatment prior to embolism, thrombosis and rupture are necessary to prevent formidable complications. 3) Timely detection of aneurysms and their complications by general practitioners is extremely low due to rarity and specificity of the disease, presence of various symptoms. It is necessary to popularize knowledge about this disease among general practitioners. 4) Sonography is screening method for differential diagnosis. 5) CT-angiography or subtraction angiography are advisable to assess distal perfusion if patient's state is stable without severe ischemia. 6) Aneurysm repair with popliteal artery replacement should be performed in early period after rupture in order to reduce time of ischemia and to prevent infection of hematoma in view of ischemia and anemia. Цель - на основании анализа литературы и собственного опыта улучшить диагностику и результаты хирургического лечения разрыва - редкого осложнения истинных аневризм подколенных артерий. Материал и методы. За период с 1999 по 2015 г. в отделении сосудистой хирургии НИИ СП им. Н.В. Склифосовского оперированы 8 пациентов по поводу разрыва аневризмы подколенной артерии. Осложнение в виде разрыва составило 2,9% всех выявленных аневризм. У 7 больных разрыв сопровождался ишемией конечности различной выраженности: острой I стадии - у 2 (25%), острой IIА стадии - у 1 (12,5%), острой IIБ стадии - у 1 (12,5%), хронической IIБ стадии - у 2 (25%), хронической III стадии - у 1 (12,5%), ишемии конечности не было у 1 (12,5%) больного. Дооперационно во всех наблюдениях выполняли УЗДГ артерий, УЗИ мягких тканей нижних конечностей, в трех - МСКТ-исследование сосудистого русла и мягких тканей бедра и голени, в пяти - субтракционную дигитальную ангиографию. Оценивали наличие и размер гематомы мягких тканей, состояние артериального русла проксимальнее и дистальнее подколенной артерии, а также выявляли аневризмы контралатеральной конечности и аневризмы иной локализации. Результаты. Оперированные конечности удалось сохранить в 6 наблюдениях. 5 больных выписаны с функционирующим протезом, полной компенсацией кровообращения, первичным заживлением послеоперационной раны. Тяжелые послеоперационные осложнения, потребовавшие ампутации конечности, развились у 2 больных. Умер один больной с реперфузионным синдромом, инфицированием гематомы и протеза, сепсисом. Вывод. 1. Разрыв аневризмы подколенной артерии, возникающий крайне редко, тем не менее является тяжелым осложнением, угрожающим потерей конечности, а иногда и жизни больного. 2. С целью предотвращения грозных осложнений необходимы раннее выявление аневризмы подколенных артерий и хирургическое лечение до возникновения эмболии, тромбоза и разрыва. 3. Своевременная выявляемость как наличия самих аневризм подколенных артерий, так и их осложнений врачами общей практики, крайне низкая, что обусловлено редкостью и специфичностью заболевания, наличием множества симптомов. Необходима популяризация знаний об этом заболевании среди врачей общей практики. 4. Скрининговым методом выявления и дифференциальной диагностики служит ультразвуковое исследование. 5. Для оценки состояния дистального артериального русла (так называемых путей оттока) при стабильном состоянии больного и неугрожающей ишемии конечности возможно выполнение мультиспиральной КТ-ангиографии или субтракционной ангиографии. 6. Оперативное лечение в объеме резекции аневризмы, протезирования подколенной артерии необходимо выполнять в ранние сроки после возникновения разрыва, чтобы сократить сроки ишемии конечности и предотвратить инфицирование гематомы на фоне ишемии конечности и анемизации больного."

    "abstract": "Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA), which has been increasingly used for the management of hemorrhagic shock, is a less invasive strategy for the management of patients with very severe hemorrhage. However, its effectiveness remains controversial. This retrospective case series included trauma patients who underwent REBOA for hemorrhagic shock due to trauma in four Japanese tertiary care emergency centers from January 2013 to March 2017. Patients in cardiac arrest at the time of REBOA and those who underwent REBOA for nontraumatic causes during the study period were excluded. A total of 24 patients underwent REBOA during the study period. The median age was 52 years (interquartile range (IQR) 36.5-62.5), 17 (70.8%) of the patients were male, and 23 (95.8%) had blunt trauma. The 24-h survival was 50% (n = 12), and the in-hospital survival rate was 41.7% (10/24). In all cases, REBOA was performed in emergency rooms by emergency physicians without fluoroscopic guidance. Complications of REBOA were mesenteric ischemia (n = 1, 4.2%), ischemia of the lower extremities (n = 1, 4.2%), and placement of REBOA in thoracic aortic injury (n = 3, 12.5%). REBOA can be an effective and feasible tool for controlling massive hemorrhage due to trauma. However, caution should be exercised regarding complications including placement of REBOA in aortic injury and limb ischemia in cases where REBOA is performed in an emergency department setting with minimal or no support from trauma surgeons."

Computed tomographic angiography demonstrated occlusion of the infrarenal aorta beginning just above the patient's known abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and extending into both common iliac arteries. He was emergently treated via open repair of the AAA with a Gore-Tex tube graft, bilateral common iliac thrombectomies, and bilateral lower extremity four-compartment fasciotomies. Post-operatively, he had monophasic signals in both posterior tibial arteries, neither of which was present before the operation. During recovery, he developed an ileus but otherwise did not have complications. He was discharged to rehabilitation on post-operative day 15."

    "abstract": "Descending thoracic aortic aneurysm rupture is a life-threatening disease associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Treatment in these cases is a surgical emergency. Less invasive therapies for the treatment of this pathology have been developed over time. For descending thoracic aneurysm rupture, endovascular stent grafting is less invasive, life-saving, and a unique alternative to open repair. However, this approach is subject to anatomical and logistic limitations. The purpose of the present study is to report a case of an emergency endovascular repair for a ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysm in a patient with peripheral arterial disease, and to discuss some important issues related to this approach. Severe calcifications were discovered in this patient on both iliac arteries, and the remaining circulated lumen was less than 2 to 3 mm. Unfortunately, only catheter insertion into the left iliac artery for angiography was able to determine the development of a dissection in the arterial wall. We decided to dilate both iliac arteries with partial stabilization of the dissection on the right iliac artery which allowed us to successfully continue the endovascular procedure. After 24 hours, the patient experienced right limb ischemia, and revascularization of the affected limb was achieved by performing a right axillofemoral bypass."

    "title": "Early Outcomes following Endovascular, Open Surgical, and Hybrid Revascularization for Lower Extremity Acute Limb Ischemia.",
    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia (ALI) of the lower extremity is a potentially devastating condition that requires urgent and definitive management. This challenging scenario is often treated with endovascular, open surgical, or hybrid revascularization (HyR) in an urgent basis, but the comparative effects of such therapies remain poorly defined. The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of endovascular, open surgical, and HyR for ALI in the contemporary era. A large statewide cardiovascular consortium of 45 hospitals was queried for patients between January 2012 and June 2015 who underwent an endovascular, open surgical, or HyR for ALI deemed at high risk of limb loss if not treated within 24 hr (Rutherford class IIA or IIB). A propensity score weighted analysis was performed controlling for demographics, medical history, and procedure type for patients. The primary outcomes were 30-day morbidity and mortality. A total of 1,480 patients underwent endovascular revascularization (ER; n = 818), open surgical revascularization (OSR; n = 195), or hybrid revascularization (HyR; n = 467) for ALI. The mean age was similar across revascularization technique with an increased predominance of male gender in open surgery cohort. Comorbidities for all groups were consistent with peripheral arterial disease. The most common endovascular procedures were angioplasty (93%) and thrombolysis (49.8%), whereas the most common surgical revascularization was femoral to popliteal bypass (32.8%), femoral to tibial bypass (28.2%), and thrombectomy (19.0%); ER as compared with OSR and HyR procedures was associated with less transfusion (OSR versus ER, odds ratio [OR] 2.7; HyR versus ER, OR 2.8; P < 0.001) and major amputation (OSR versus ER, OR 3.4; HyR versus ER, OR 4.0; P < 0.001) within 30 days of intervention. There was no difference in 30-day freedom from reintervention, myocardial infarction (MI), or mortality. Among patients requiring urgent revascularization for Rutherford grade IIA and IIB ischemia, ER has lower 30-day morbidity but similar mortality and rates of reintervention. Although long-term patency rates were not compared, ER may offer superior short-term outcomes compared with open surgery and hybrid revascularization."

    "abstract": "The accepted treatment for acute limb ischemia (ALI) is immediate systemic anticoagulation and timely reperfusion to restore blood flow. In this study, we describe the retrospective assessment of pretransfer management decisions by referring hospitals to an academic tertiary care facility and its impact on perioperative adverse events. A retrospective analysis of ALI patients transferred to us via our Level I Vascular Emergency Program from 2010 to 2013 was performed. Patient demographics, comorbidities, Rutherford ischemia classification, time to anticoagulation, and time to reperfusion were tabulated and analyzed for correlation to incidence of major adverse limb events (MALEs), mortality, and bypass patency in the perioperative period (30-day postoperative). All intervals were calculated from the onset of symptoms and categorized into 3 subcohorts (<6 hr, 6-48 hr, and >48 hr). Eighty-seven patients with an average age of 64.0 (±16.2) years presented to outlying hospitals and were transferred to us with lower extremity ALI. The mean delay from symptom onset to initial referring physician evaluation was 18.3 hr. At that time of evaluation, 53.8% had Rutherford class IIA ischemia and 36.3% had class IIB ischemia. Seventy-six patients (87.4%) were started on heparin previous to transfer. However, only 44 patients (57.9%) reached therapeutic levels as measured by activated partial thromboplastin time before definitive revascularization. A delay of anticoagulation initiation >48 hr from symptom onset was associated with increased 30-day reintervention rates compared with the <6 hr group (66.7% vs. 23.5%; P < 0.05). However, time to reperfusion had no statistically significant impact on MALE, 30-day mortality, or 30-day interventional patency in our small cohorts. Additionally, patients with a previous revascularization had a higher 30-day reintervention rate (46.5%; P < 0.05). The practice of timely therapeutic anticoagulation of patients referred for ALI from community facilities occurs less frequently than expected and is associated with an increased perioperative reintervention rate."

    "abstract": "Single-length saphenous vein continues to be the conduit of choice in infected-field critical limb ischemia. However, half of these individuals have inadequate vein secondary to previous use or chronic venous disease. We reviewed our outcomes of infected-field infrainguinal bypasses performed with cryopreserved homografts (CHs), a widely accepted alternative to autogenous vein in this setting. This is a retrospective, institutional descriptive analysis of infected-field infrainguinal revascularizations between 2012 and 2015. Twenty-four operations were performed in the same number of patients for limb ischemia with signs of active infection. The mean age of the cohort examined was 62.5 ± 14.4 (standard deviation) years. Mean Society of Vascular Surgery risk score was 3.9 with a baseline Rutherford's chronic ischemia score of 4.3 at presentation. Emergent procedures constituted 29% of cases, and the remainder cases were urgent procedures. The CH bypass captured was a reoperative procedure in all but one of the patients. Culture positivity was present in 75% of cases with Staphylococcus aureus (29%), the most commonly isolated organism. Thirty-day mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events were both 4%. Amputation-free survival (AFS) was 75% at 30 days. Similarly, 30-day reintervention was 38% with debridement (43%) and bleeding (29%), the most common indications. Average duration of follow-up was 27.9 ± 20.4 months (range: 0.5-60.4). Mean length of stay was 14.8 days. Reinfection requiring an additional procedure or antibiotic regimen separate from the index antibiotic course was 13%. Primary patency and AFS at 1 year was 50% and 58%, respectively. Primary patency and AFS at 2 years was 38% and 52%, respectively. Limb salvage at 1 and 2 years was 70% and 65%, respectively. Fifteen patients (63%) required reintervention during the follow-up period with 40% of those subjects undergoing multiple procedures. CHs remain a marginal salvage conduit in the setting of infection and no autogenous choices. Therefore, clinicians should individualize usage of this high-cost product in highly selected patients only."

    "abstract": "We evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous lidocaine in adult patients with acute and chronic pain who are undergoing pain management in the emergency department (ED). We searched Ovid CENTRAL, Ovid EMBASE, and Ovid MEDLINE databases for randomized controlled trials and observational studies from inception to January 2017. Efficacy outcomes included reduction in pain scores from baseline to postintervention and need for rescue analgesia. Safety outcomes included incidence of serious (eg, cardiac arrest) and nonserious (eg, dizziness) adverse events. We used the Cochrane Collaboration tool and a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to evaluate the risk of bias across studies. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to evaluate the confidence in the evidence available. From a total of 1,947 titles screened, 61 articles were selected for full-text review. Eight studies met the inclusion criteria and underwent qualitative analysis, including 536 patients. The significant clinical heterogeneity and low quality of studies precluded a meta-analysis. Among the 6 randomized controlled trials included, intravenous lidocaine had efficacy equivalent to that of active controls in 2 studies, and was better than active controls in 2 other studies. In particular, intravenous lidocaine had pain score reduction comparable to or higher than that of intravenous morphine for pain associated with renal colic and critical limb ischemia. Lidocaine did not appear to be effective for migraine headache in 2 studies. There were 20 adverse events reported by 6 studies among 225 patients who received intravenous lidocaine in the ED, 19 nonserious and 1 serious (rate 8.9%, 95% confidence interval 5.5% to 13.4% for any adverse event; and 0.4%, 95% confidence interval 0% to 2.5% for serious adverse events). The confidence in the evidence available for the outcomes evaluated was deemed to be very low because of methodological limitations, including risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. There is limited current evidence to define the role of intravenous lidocaine as an analgesic for patients with acute renal colic and critical limb ischemia pain in the ED. Its efficacy for other indications has not been adequately tested. The safety of lidocaine for ED pain management has not been adequately examined."

Advances in vascular imaging techniques have demonstrated that involvement of the large vessels of the upper and lower limbs may be more prevalent than was once thought, although the clinical implications of this are unknown. Isolated lower extremity claudication without systemic or classic cranial symptoms, especially as a primary manifestation of giant cell arteritis, is rare. We present the case of a patient with isolated bilateral limb claudication that rapidly progressed to critical limb ischemia requiring urgent surgical intervention after steroid therapy.

    "abstract": "To evaluate the clinical features and outcomes of patients with anemia undergoing percutaneous peripheral vascular intervention (PVI) in a contemporary registry. We evaluated the differences in the clinical features and outcomes of patients with and without anemia undergoing PVI in the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Cardiovascular Consortium (BMC2 VIC) registry. Anemia was defined using World Health Organization criteria. Baseline anemia was present in 42.3% of 15,683 patients undergoing PVI. Compared to patients without anemia, those with anemia were older (mean age, 67 years vs 71 years), were more often black (16% vs 29%), and had higher comorbidities. Anemic patients were twice as likely to present with acute limb ischemia (5% vs 11%) and undergo urgent PVI (6% vs 15%) or below-the-knee PVI (18% vs 35%). Many in-hospital adverse events were higher in anemic patients. In a propensity-matched cohort, any adverse outcome (3.4% vs 8.4%; odds ratio [OR], 2.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.94-3.42) or major cardiovascular event, defined as death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or amputation (1.1% vs 3.2%; OR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.83-4.79) was more likely in anemic patients. Of all adverse events, the highest odds were observed for post-PVI transfusions and amputations in anemic patients. Multivariable logistic regression showed that baseline hemoglobin (1 g/dL below the normal value) was associated with greater risk of any adverse event (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.47-1.68). The prevalence of anemia was high among PVI patients and was associated with significantly greater likelihood of amputation, any adverse event, and major cardiovascular events. Whether preprocedure correction of anemia has the potential to decrease post-PVI adverse events remains to be studied."

    "abstract": "The Formosa Fun Coast explosion is an internationally-known event that occurred in Taiwan on June 27th, 2015. The blast involved 495 casualties in total, with 253 patients receiving 2nd degree or deeper burns on greater than 40% of the total body surface area (TBSA). Questions were raised regarding whether these victims were sent to the appropriate hospitals or not. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of the initial admission destination in this study. We retrospectively reviewed all of the victims from the explosion who were sent to the emergency department of Linkou and Keelung Chang Gung Memorial Hospitals. Patients were divided by direct admission and received via transfer. The basic demographics, the efficacy of the initial resuscitation and the clinical outcomes were analyzed. In total, forty-six patients were included. Thirty-five of them were primarily admitted, and eleven of them were received via transfer. Between the two groups, there was no significant difference in the resuscitation outcome. The ratio of delaying intubation was similar (14.3% vs 27.3%, p=0.322). The rate of delayed-detected ischemic events was significantly increased in the referral group (0% vs 27.3%, p=0.001). However, there was no amputation event in either group. No difference in mortality was observed between groups (5.7% vs 9.1%, p=0.692). Our preliminary findings suggest that local hospitals are capable of providing high-quality acute care to mass casualty burn victims. Our results suggest that patients with suspected limb ischemia should be rapidly transferred to a regional burn center to ensure optimal care. Systemic pre-planning such as employing telemedicine and personnel collaboration, should be considered by the administration to maximize the function of preliminary hospitals in burn care."

However, they can also present with life threatening head and neck injuries, massive soft tissue trauma, as well as combined orthopedic and vascular extremity injuries where a high possibility of limb loss exists. We present two adult dog bite victims with multiple bites inflicted by large canines identified as Pit-Bull Terriers. They were presented with deep lacerations to the axillary area resulting in limb ischemia and loss of upper limb pulses. The right axillary artery was crushed in both patients whilst the axillary vein was lacerated in one. The vessels were repaired; the wounds debrided and both limbs were salvaged. Canine attacks by Pit Bull Terriers and Rottweiler's can occur at any age and in any anatomical area of the body particularly the limbs. Injuries involving the extremities presenting with no pulses or pulsatile bleeding demand an urgent exploration as any undue delay is intolerable especially if there are bony injuries like fractures or fracture/dislocation. All patients with complex neurovascular injuries should be managed by a multidisciplinary team for an optimal outcome. Attacks by Pit Bull Terriers are more likely to cause severe morbidity than other breeds of dogs. Immediate surgical exploration is required to prevent catastrophic outcomes, especially limb loss. Stronger animal control laws, public education and responsible dog ownership may reduce deaths from these canines."

    "abstract": "The PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor evolocumab reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and cardiovascular events in the FOURIER trial (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk). We investigated the efficacy and safety of evolocumab in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) as well as the effect on major adverse limb events. FOURIER was a randomized trial of evolocumab versus placebo in 27 564 patients with atherosclerotic disease on statin therapy followed for a median of 2.2 years. Patients were identified as having PAD at baseline if they had intermittent claudication and an ankle brachial index of <0.85, or if they had a prior peripheral vascular procedure. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospital admission for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization. The key secondary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. An additional outcome of interest was major adverse limb events defined as acute limb ischemia, major amputation, or urgent peripheral revascularization for ischemia. Three thousand six hundred forty-two patients (13.2%) had PAD (1505 with no prior myocardial infarction or stroke). Evolocumab significantly reduced the primary end point consistently in patients with PAD (hazard ratio [HR] 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66-0.94; P=0.0098) and without PAD (HR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80-0.93; P=0.0003; Pinteraction=0.40). For the key secondary end point, the HRs were 0.73 (0.59-0.91; P=0.0040) for those with PAD and 0.81 (0.73-0.90; P<0.0001) for those without PAD (Pinteraction=0.41). Because of their higher risk, patients with PAD had larger absolute risk reductions for the primary end point (3.5% with PAD, 1.6% without PAD) and the key secondary end point (3.5% with PAD, 1.4% without PAD). Evolocumab reduced the risk of major adverse limb events in all patients (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.38-0.88; P=0.0093) with consistent effects in those with and without known PAD. There was a consistent relationship between lower achieved low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lower risk of limb events (P=0.026 for the beta coefficient) that extended down to <10 mg/dL. Patients with PAD are at high risk of cardiovascular events, and PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab significantly reduced that risk with large absolute risk reductions. Moreover, lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with evolocumab reduced the risk of major adverse limb events. URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT01764633."

    "abstract": "To demonstrate feasibility and safety of ultrasound-guided popliteal sciatic nerve block for providing analgesia during urgent endovascular treatment of critical limb ischemia with resting pain. Ultrasound-guided popliteal sciatic blocks were performed by an interventional radiologist in angiography suite immediately prior to commencement of urgent endovascular treatment of 30 critical limb ischemia patients. Subjective pain levels prior to and following sciatic block were assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS). Need for any supplemental anxiolytics or analgesics during treatment was recorded. Post-procedural evaluation of patient and operator satisfaction levels regarding the intervention was also documented. Ultrasound-guided sciatic block provided adequate analgesia in all patients; VAS scores were 0 (no pain) in 87% and 1-3 (mild to annoying pain) in 13%. Two patients required anxiolytic premedication. Additional analgesia was not required during course of endovascular treatment of any patients. Time necessary to perform sciatic block ranged 3-9 (mean 5.9 ± 1.3) min. Median number of needle attempts was 1 (range 1-3). Onset of satisfactory block ranged from 5 to 20 min (mean 9.4 ± 2.6 min). Mean treatment time was 102.2 ± 36.7 min, and balloon time was 22.4 ± 6.1 min. Patient and operator satisfaction with pain control were very good in all cases. There were no procedure-related complications. Ultrasound-guided popliteal sciatic block is a feasible and safe alternative for providing adequate analgesia during urgent endovascular treatment of critical limb ischemia with resting pain.

Primary endpoint included incidence of distal embolization, acute limb ischemia, or emergency limb amputation. Safety endpoints were freedom from bleeding, vessel perforation, or dissection. Lesion location was in the superficial femoral artery in 39% of cases and popliteal and infrapopliteal in 61% of patients. Procedural success was achieved in 98.4% of patients and 1 patient had distal embolization. There was no bleeding or perforation or major flow-limiting vessel dissection. Our study demonstrated that the cuff-occlusion strategy was feasible and safe for protection form distal embolization in PVI. Further study is required to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this novel method compared with existing devices for distal protection."

The Ovation Prime system utilizes a polymer-filled sealing ring that is cast in situ at the margin of the aneurysm; however, the residual endograft inner volume after ring filling may reduce volume and graft flow. Nevertheless, there are no reports about severe complications using the Ovation Prime system. A 75-year-old male presented to our hospital for acute lower limb ischemia. The patient reported a previous endograft for abdominal aortic aneurysm 1 month previously, which utilized the Ovation device. Computed tomography (CT) angiography demonstrated a critical narrowing of the endograft at the site of the proximal sealing rings. We decided on urgent treatment, delivering a covered stent graft (CP STENT NUMED™). Intraoperative intravascular ultrasound showed effective compaction of the proximal rings. Nine-month follow-up with CT angiography demonstrated good patency without ring recoil of the endograft. This is the first report of endovascular treatment for an acute and symptomatic shrinkage of proximal rings in the Ovation trivascular endograft. Angiographic and intravascular ultrasound findings showed that covered stenting is effective and that the ring polymer is safely moldable."

Arterial embolization is mostly associated with intracardiac tumors while lung malignancies are the second most common cause of tumor embolism. In this report, we present a male patient who developed acute bilateral lower limb ischemia in the immediate postoperative period after a thoracotomy for attempted left upper lobe resection for lung cancer. The patient was treated with a subclavian-bifemoral bypass, since an initial attempted embolectomy was unsuccessful. Histopathological characteristics of thrombus obtained during embolectomy were consistent with the histopathology of the primary tumor. Acute ischemia is an emergency that should be diagnosed and treated immediately. Interestingly, in this case, the presence of epidural anesthesia masked the initial symptoms and delayed diagnosis. Preoperative assessment with transesophageal echocardiography may reveal patients at high risk for tumor embolism."

In this study, we analyzed prognostic factors for AFB patency and limb salvage rate to facilitate the choice of procedure. Between Jan 2006 and Aug 2013, 45 patients underwent AFB surgery in our department, 24 for critical limb ischemia (CLI) and 23 for infection. Endpoints of study were graft occlusion, graft infection, amputation and patient's death. Prognostic factors were compared by univariate analysis for each indication group. Mean follow-up was 40.2 (±23.2) months. Complication rate was significantly higher in infection group (88.0 vs. 54.4%, p = 0.003) and in emergency surgery (83.3 vs. 56.9%, p = 0.023). Overall primary patency rate after AFB procedures was 66.7% after 1, 3, and 5 years, while secondary patency rate was 91.1% after 1 year, 82.2% after 3 years and 80.0% after 5 years. The primary and secondary patency rates did not significantly differ between the both groups (p = 0.059 and p = 0.136). Following prognostic factors showed a statistically significant influence on patency rates in CLI group: >1 previous vascular surgical intervention, patch angioplasty at the distal anastomosis site, complications after previous vascular surgery, and perioperative intake of platelet aggregation inhibitor. Only the employed bypass material had a statistical significant influence on the secondary patency rates in the infection group. Overall limb salvage rate was 82.2% after 1 year, 80.0% after 3 years and 77.8% after 5 years. There were statistically significant differences in the limb salvage rates depending on emergency surgery and a 3-vessel-run-off in the lower leg in both indication groups. AFB have acceptable patency and limb salvage rates. AFB is a good alternative in patients with CLI at high operative risk or with infections of aortoiliac segments, even with endovascular approaches.

CT angiography showed a spiral type B dissection with collapse of the proximal portion of the endovascular repair of aortic aneurysm (EVAR) device and left limb occlusion. Urgent treatment with thoracic endovascular aortic repair distal to the left subclavian covered the entry tear and redirected the majority of the flow to the true lumen leading to near immediate expansion of the proximal portion of the EVAR device. After surgical femoral control, balloon embolectomy of the occluded iliac limb was performed and the limb relined. His lower extremity ischemic symptoms resolved, and his abdominal and back pain dissipated. At latest 6-month follow-up, CT angiography shows an intact thoracic endovascular aortic repair stent graft and a widely patent EVAR stent graft, and the patient has no further abdominal, back, or leg symptoms. ATBD causing proximal abdominal EVAR collapse is an extremely rare presentation of false lumen pressurization and can be treated similarly to complicated type B dissection with the goal of restoring true lumen patency."

The patient is an 18-year-old healthy female who presented to the emergency department with acute left lower extremity ischemia. Her symptoms began as sudden onset mild foot pain approximately two months ago. Over the 72h prior to presentation, she developed severe pain, pallor, paralysis, loss of pedal pulses, paresthesia, and poikilothermia. Due to her advanced ischemia, she was taken immediately to the operating room for angiography and intervention. Initial angiography demonstrated distal superficial femoral and popliteal artery occlusions along with lack of tibial or pedal artery blood flow. She underwent percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy and initiation of catheter directed thrombolysis. After 48h of catheter directed thrombolysis and repeat mechanical thrombectomy, computed tomography (CT) was performed and demonstrated external compression of the superficial femoral artery in the adductor canal and residual chronic thrombus. Echocardiography and CT of the thoracic aorta was also performed, and were negative, therefore excluding other potential sources of arterial embolism. She next underwent surgical exploration, division of an anomalous musculotendinous band compressing the left superficial femoral artery and thromboendarterectomy of the distal left superficial femoral artery. The patient recovered well without any post-operative complications and could return to her daily activities 3 weeks following surgery. Knowledge of rare non-atherosclerotic vascular disorders, such as adductor canal compression syndrome, is paramount when treating patients who present with limb ischemia and lack traditional risk factors."

There are little data on the effect of functional status on the outcomes of endovascular lower extremity interventions, especially in the elderly frail population. This is a retrospective analysis of the American College of Surgeons - National Surgical Quality Improvement Program files for the years 2011-2013 to assess the impact of functional status on outcome after endovascular intervention for critical limb ischemia (CLI). Elderly patients (age ≥70) undergoing revascularization for CLI were included. The patients were divided into 2 groups based on functional status prior to surgery: independent (IND) or dependent (DEP), which included partially dependent as well as totally dependent patients. The 2 groups were compared with respect to demographics, comorbidities, complications, length of stay, limb loss, and mortality. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. There were 1,055 patients (DEP = 253, 24%). There was no difference in gender or race but DEP patients were older than IND (P = 0.008). DEP patients were significantly more likely to have history of congestive heart failure (P = 0.003), hypertension (P = 0.042), and diabetes (P <0.001). There was no difference in emergent surgeries between the 2 groups (P = 1.00). DEP patients had more tibial interventions compared with IND (P <0.001). DEP developed more pneumonia (P <0.001) and septic shock (P = 0.016) and had a trend toward more urinary tract infections (P = 0.051) after endovascular revascularization. There was no significant difference in operating time (P = 0.232) or major amputation (P = 0.092). DEP had significantly longer length of hospital stay (P = 0.0068). DEP had significantly higher mortality (5.98% vs. 2.01%, P = 0.002). On multivariate analysis, DEP status, emergency procedure, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation, myocardial infarction, sepsis, and septic shock were independently associated with 30 days of mortality. Irrespective of age, DEP functional status was the most significant preoperative predictor of mortality with an odd ratio of 5.16 [1.93-13.83], P = 0.001 (parsimonious model). Functional status should be carefully assessed when considering endovascular revascularization in the elderly as DEP has significantly higher morbidity and mortality."

The aim was to describe the early chain of care in ALLI focusing on lead times and emergency management in order to identify weak links for improvement. This was a retrospective, descriptive case study. This study analysed the medical records of all patients with a main discharge diagnosis of ALLI between January 2009 and December 2014. Predetermined emergency care data on lead times, diagnosis recognition, presenting symptoms, emergency care treatment and outcome were collected for patients who were transported by the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) and those who were not. In total, 552 medical records were audited of which 195 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were analysed. Among them were 117 (60%) transported by the EMS. The median time from symptom onset to revascularisation was 23 (interquartile range [IQR] 10-55; EMS transported) and 93 (IQR 42-152, not EMS transported) hours (p < .01). The time from symptom onset to arrival in hospital was 5 (IQR 2-26; EMS transported) and 48 (IQR 6-108; not EMS transported) hours. After arrival in hospital, the median time to first doctor evaluation was 51 (IQR 28-90; EMS transported) and 80 (IQR 44-169; not EMS transported) minutes, p = .01. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was given to 72% of patients in the emergency department (ED) and a multivariate analysis showed that the use of LMWH was associated with a more favourable outcome. Both the time spent in the ED and the time from the onset of symptoms to revascularisation were considerably longer than optimal. Time delays in the early treatment chain can mainly be attributed to \"patient delay\" and a considerable time spent in hospital before revascularisation. The use of LMWH as an integral part of ED management was associated with a better outcome."

CDAR system could retrieve clinical data from all 42 public hospitals in our region, which provided almost 90% inpatient care of the population. Daily incidence was defined as total number of emergency admissions from all 42 pubic hospitals due to ALI from 00:00 till 23:59 hr of that day. For the 10-year period, spanning from January 2005 to December 2014, there were a total of 634 recorded ALI with revascularization, 608 (95.9%) of which underwent emergency femoral embolectomy, 15 (2.4%) underwent thrombolysis, and 11 (1.7%) underwent thrombolysis and embolectomy. ALIs with primary amputation or conservative management were excluded from the study. The average daily incidence of ALI was 0.170. A linear regression model was built using mean ambient temperature as independent variable and incidence of ALI as dependent variables. The line of best fit was drawn through the data points. The daily incidence of ALI could be predicted by ambient temperature (in °C) with the equation: incidence = 0.274-0.004 × temperature (linear regression; r = -0.053, r2 = 0.003, F = 10.42, and P = 0.001). In other words, daily incidence was 0.274 at 0°C; and for every 10°C increase, the incidence would drop by 0.040. At 30°C, daily incidence of ALI was 0.154. This study showed an association of cold temperature and ALI in our population. Measures to protect the susceptible population from cold temperatures should be considered."

    "title": "Treating Peripheral Artery Disease in the Wake of Rising Costs and Protracted Length of Stay.",
    "abstract": "There has been growing scrutiny in the treatment of patients with peripheral artery disease due to the utilization of resources to manage this complex patient population. The purpose of this study was to determine the factors associated with prolonged length of stay (LOS > 7 days) following lower extremity bypass using data from the Vascular Quality Initiative as well as to define the additional costs incurred due to prolonged LOS in our health system. Summary statistics were performed of patients undergoing lower extremity bypass from 2010 to 2015. Student's t-tests and χ2 tests were performed to compare those with and without prolonged LOS. Multivariable logistic regression was then performed to determine the independent predictors for increased LOS. We then compared our institutional LOS with that of representative institutions from the University Health System Consortium and evaluated the impact of prolonged LOS on limb salvage and survival. This study included 334 patients with a mean age of 66.4 ± 12.4 years, 64.7% males, 58.5% of white race, 11.1% on dialysis, 80.5% smokers, and 53.6% with diabetes. The mean LOS was 15.7 ± 12.2 days. Prolonged LOS was associated with transfer (15.4% vs. 2.3%, P = 0.001), diabetes (58.3% vs. 40.2%, P = 0.004), critical limb ischemia (71.3% vs. 49.4%, P < 0.001), preoperative need for ambulatory assistance (44.5% vs. 16.1%, P < 0.001), prior ipsilateral bypass (6.9% vs. 1.1%, P = 0.042), urgent surgery (39.7% vs. 9.8%, P < 0.001), tibial or distal target vessel (52.7% vs. 28.0%, P < 0.001), use of vein (65.4% vs. 46.3%, P = 0.002), return to operating room (42.6% vs. 1.2%, P < 0.001), ambulatory assistance (65.0% vs. 34.1%, P < 0.001) as well as discharge anticoagulant (22.8% vs. 9.8%, P = 0.010). Multivariable logistic regression identified urgency (odds ratio [OR] = 5.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.16-12.02, P < 0.001), critical limb ischemia (OR = 3.12, 95% CI 1.65-5.90, P < 0.001), return to OR (OR = 40.30, 95% CI 5.36-303.20, P < 0.001), use of vein (OR = 2.19, 95% CI 1.18-4.07, P = 0.013), and the need for anticoagulation at discharge (OR = 2.56, 95% CI 1.03-6.33, P = 0.043) as independent predictors of LOS > 7 days. Prolonged hospital stays accounted for an additional $40,561.64 in total cost and $26,028 in direct costs incurred. Despite these increased costs, limb salvage and overall survival were not adversely impacted in the prolonged LOS group in follow-up. Lower extremity bypass is associated with a longer than expected LOS in our health system, much of which can be attributed to return to the OR for minor amputations and wound issues. This led to added total and direct costs, where the majority of this increase was attributable to prolonged LOS. Limb salvage and overall survival were preserved, however, in this subset of patients in follow-up. These findings suggest that lower extremity bypass patients are a resource-intensive population of patients, but that these costs are worthwhile in the setting of preserved limb salvage and overall survival."

Other imaging and noninvasive physiologic tests may prove important for longer term management but are less recommended in the acute setting. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios.

We report a patient who ingested foxglove mistaking it for comfrey and developed refractory ventricular arrhythmias. The patient died despite treatment with digoxin-specific antibody fragments (DSFab) and veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO). A 55-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting and generalized weakness eight hours after drinking \"comfrey\" tea. She had bradycardia (54 beats/min) and hyperkalemia (7.6 mEq/L). Electrocardiogram revealed a first-degree atrioventricular conduction block with premature atrial contractions, followed by polymorphic ventricular tachycardia three hours after arrival. A serum digoxin level was 151.2 ng/mL. The patient developed ventricular fibrillation while waiting for Digibind infusion. Resuscitation was performed and an emergent VA-ECMO was set up. A total of eight vials of Digibind were given over the next 16 hours. She temporarily regained consciousness, but remained hemodynamically unstable and subsequently developed lower limb ischemia and multiple organ failure, and she expired on hospital day seven. A botanist confirmed that the plant was foxglove. The diagnosis of cardiac glycoside plant poisoning can be difficult in the absence of an accurate exposure history. In facilities where DSFab is unavailable or insufficient, early VA-ECMO might be considered in severely cardiotoxic patients unresponsive to conventional therapy."

The incidence of these complications and other outcomes is poorly understood in young trauma victims who receive endovascular aortic repair of blunt thoracic aortic injury (BTAI). A 29-year-old pedestrian was struck by a vehicle resulting in polytrauma including BTAI with transection distal to the left subclavian artery origin. The patient underwent successful TEVAR. Nine months later, the patient developed transient paresthesia below the waist that progressed to bilateral lower extremity paralysis and malperfusion syndrome below the diaphragm including nonpalpable pulses in the lower extremities, acute renal failure, and ischemic colitis. Imaging demonstrated near occlusive thrombosis of the distal end of the thoracic endograft. An emergent axillobifemoral bypass resolved the organ malperfusion and acute limb ischemia. Patients who have undergone TEVAR for BTAI may develop asymptomatic or symptomatic intragraft thrombosis. In patients presenting with malperfusion syndrome below the diaphragm, extra-anatomic bypass can expeditiously resolve symptoms until definitive treatment can be performed. Oversizing of thoracic stents in trauma patient may lead to intragraft thrombosis."

The medical charts of patients with PAOD (n=466) and CLI (n=223) were reviewed and data were collected. The study included 689 patients; mean age 67 years for PAOD patients and 65 years for CLI patients. A significantly higher percentage of patients were male in both groups (79.25%, P < 0.0001). Most of the patients in both groups had received at least a secondary education (P < 0.0001). Most of the subjects in both groups were smokers (>71.30%) with no difference between groups (P = 0.566). No significant differences were found between the groups in comorbidities (diabetes, arterial blood hypertension, cardiac ischemia, rhythm disorders, P > 0.05). There were more CLI patients that were overweight than overweight patients with PAOD (P = 0.0004).

The goal of this study was to determine the incidence, risk factors, and effect of DE on the outcomes of lower extremity endovascular interventions (LEIs). All LEIs between 2010 and 2014 in the Vascular Study Group of New England (VSGNE) database were reviewed. Patient characteristics were analyzed to determine predictors of DE. LEIs involving the superficial femoral artery (SFA) were reviewed to assess the effect of type of treatment on DE. The outcomes examined were loss of patency, limb loss, and mortality after LEI involving the SFA. A multivariable regression was used to determine predictors of DE. There were 10,875 procedures. The incidence of DE was 17.3 per 1000 procedures, and 68% required treatment (57% endovascular, 11% open surgery). DE was more common in patients treated for critical limb ischemia compared with claudication (relative risk [RR], 2.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-3.45; P = .006) and for emergency interventions compared with elective (RR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.22-7.30; P = .017). DE increased with the number of arteries treated (P < .0001) and with the length of occlusion (P < .0001). The SFA was the most commonly treated artery (4751 [43.7%]). In comparison with atherectomy and balloon angioplasty, stenting alone (RR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.17-0.73; P = .005), balloon angioplasty alone (RR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.13-0.41; P < .0001), and combined stenting and balloon angioplasty (RR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.17-0.49; P < .0001) were associated with a significantly lower risk of DE. DE was not significantly associated with loss of patency, major amputation, or mortality. The incidence of DE during LEIs is 1% to 2% in the VSGNE database, and most patients are treated with additional endovascular interventions. The incidence increases in patients with critical limb ischemia and with the use of atherectomy."

    "abstract": "Hospital readmissions after surgical operations are preventable and are now counted as a quality metric. Patients with peripheral arterial disease often have several serious medical comorbidities. With advancements in endovascular technology and increasing comfort level of vascular surgeons, more and more patients with peripheral arterial disease are being treated with endovascular therapy. Most of these interventions are done as same-day operations. This study retrospectively reviewed the factors associated with hospital readmission after lower extremity endovascular interventions. This study used the 2013 endovascular repair-targeted American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database and generalized 2013 general and vascular surgery Program User Files. Patient, diagnosis, and procedure characteristics of patients undergoing lower extremity endovascular surgery were assessed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine independent risk factors for hospital readmission ≤30 days after surgery. During 2013, 1096 patients (61% men, 39% women) underwent lower extremity endovascular interventions. Indications for operations included claudication (40%), critical limb ischemia with rest pain (19%), critical limb ischemia with tissue loss (35%), and others (6%) Among these patients, 147 (13.4%) were readmitted to the hospital ≤30 days after surgery, and ∼46% of all readmissions were ≤2 weeks after the discharge The following factors had significant associations with readmission: smoking (odds ratio [OR], 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.3-0.9), noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 0.9-3.2), dyspnea (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1-3.7), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2-3.6), body mass index >30 kg/m2 (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.3-5.1), dependent functional status (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.4-4.8), emergent surgery (OR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.9-9.6), and unplanned return to the operating room (OR, 8.3; 95% CI, 4.7-14.7). Readmission after lower extremity endovascular intervention is a serious complication. Various factors place a patient at a high risk for readmission. High body mass index, unplanned return to the operating room, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, nonsmoking status, dyspnea, dependent functional status, and emergency operation are independent risk factors for hospital readmission. Return to operating room is associated with an 8.3-fold increase in hospital readmission."

However, growing use of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has revived interest in this technique. We analyzed the current indications for BAV and outcomes in a single center. Acute results and long-term outcomes were analyzed in a retrospective single-center registry of patients undergoing BAV between January 2013 and January 2016. Twenty-three patients underwent BAV, 56.5% male, mean age 78±7 years. Indications were severe aortic stenosis and decompensated heart failure (n=5), urgent non-cardiac surgery (n=8), or bridge to definitive treatment (n=10). Peak invasive gradient decreased from a median of 54.0±19.0 mmHg to 28.5±13.8 mmHg (p=0.002). Complications included one ischemic stroke, one lower limb ischemia and one femoral pseudoaneurysm requiring surgery. During a mean follow-up of 11±10 months, eight patients underwent TAVI and two underwent surgical aortic valve replacement. Thirteen patients died, nine of non-cardiovascular causes. On Kaplan-Meier analysis mortality was significantly lower among patients undergoing definitive treatment (20.0% vs. 84.6% at two-year follow-up; p=0.005).

We performed elective percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PCI) to the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). The sudden thrombus formation in the LAD occurred during the procedure. We suspected HIT and administered argatroban. We deployed four everolimus-eluting stents in the LAD and intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP) support was started. The platelet counts were rapidly reduced almost 50% next day after PCI and IgG-specific anti-PF4/heparin antibodies were elevated. Multiple cerebral infarctions were detected by magnetic resonance imaging after the PCI. The patient received the continuous argatroban administration and IABP support for 4 days. Subacute stent thrombosis occurred after quitting argatroban. We performed thrombus aspiration and fibrinolytic treatment. Finally we re-inserted IABP and stabilized the hemodynamic state. Right popliteal arterial thromboembolism occurred after emergency PCI. Argatroban is essential and following oral anticoagulant therapy is necessary to prevent thromboembolic complications. <Learning objective: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an adverse immune-mediated drug reaction that is associated with thromboembolic complications. The incidence of HIT in patients who received unfractionated heparin is reported to be 0.1- 1%.

Our goal was to define the perioperative morbidity for emergency embolectomy and develop a risk prediction model for perioperative mortality. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement database was queried to identify patients undergoing emergency unilateral and lower extremity embolectomy. Patients with previous critical limb ischemia, bilateral embolectomy, nonemergency indication, and those undergoing concurrent bypass were excluded. Patient characteristics and postoperative morbidity and mortality were analyzed. Multivariate analysis for predictors of mortality was performed, and from this, a risk prediction model was developed to identify preoperative predictors of mortality. There were 1749 patients (47.9% male) who met the inclusion criteria. The average age was 68.2 ± 14.8 years. Iliofemoral-popliteal embolectomy was performed in 1231 patients (70.4%), popliteal-tibioperoneal embolectomy in 303 (17.3%), and at both levels in 215 (12.3%).

The patient with arterial thrombosis showed elevations of fibrin degradation product and D-dimer and received antithrombin and heparin intravenously. The patient with PSA was immediately assessed by a contrast-enhanced computed tomography because of a transient ischemic episode with no evidence of hypercoagulability. Newborns suspected of having arterial thrombosis may need urgent surgical intervention along with thrombolytic and anticoagulant therapy to prevent organ ischemia and amputation of extremities. Conversely, some PSA cases have reportedly been treated conservatively. This vascular anomaly was previously reported as a cause of lower limb ischemia only in a newborn. PSA is a critical differential diagnosis of neonatal arterial thrombosis that needs urgent therapeutic intervention."

    "abstract": "Acute alcohol intoxication is a common cause of emergency visits worldwide. Although moderate alcohol consumption is protective against coronary artery disease, binge drinking is associated with adverse cardiovascular and neurological outcomes and may even cause sudden death. Although, few past accounts of venous thrombosis with alcohol binge drinking are available, arterial thrombosis with the condition has never been reported in the literature. We present the unusual case of a young Afghan male, who presented to us with painful, tender and swollen legs three days after a heavy alcohol binge on a Saturday night. He was diagnosed as a case of acute limb ischemia secondary to massive abdominal aorta and bilateral femoral artery thrombosis. He also had acute renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Cardiac workup revealed new onset paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and a large thrombus in the left ventricular cavity. His blood ethanol level was high. He was treated by a multidisciplinary team; urgent surgical thrombectomy for thrombotic complications, intravenous fluid hydration and later renal replacement therapy for acute renal failure. To the best of our knowledge, such a constellation of clinical features in association with severe acute alcohol intoxication has not been reported in the literature. We believe, the procoagulant nature of high blood ethanol levels and the onset of atrial fibrillation after the heavy alcohol binge, known as the holiday heart syndrome, precipitated the thrombotic events leading to rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. Through this case, we conclude that a very heavy alcohol binge may cause thrombotic occlusion of the abdominal aorta and femoral arteries resulting in ischemic rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. A high index of suspicion must be kept, especially for a patient presenting with tender, swollen lower limbs and acute renal failure after an alcohol binge."

Thirty-day mortality was 1.6%. Survival was 92.9% at 1 year and 87.2% at 3 years. Amputation-free survival, freedom from loss of patency or death, and reintervention-free survival were 93.5%, 83%, and 87.5% at 1 year, respectively, by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Multivariable predictors of mortality were tissue loss, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), end-stage renal disease, urgent case, and age, whereas aspirin use and non-Caucasian race were protective. Tissue loss, rest pain, COPD, end-stage renal disease, stent use, nonambulatory status, and female sex were predictive of major amputation whereas aspirin use, P2Y12 antagonist use, statin use, and initial technical success were protective. Tissue loss, case urgency and nonambulatory status predicted patency loss or death. Tissue loss, COPD, stent use, and history of prior bypass predicted reintervention. Endovascular interventions of the CFA/DFA have a low rate of periprocedural morbidity and mortality. One-year patency is lower than historically observed for CFA endarterectomy. Stent use is associated with reinterventions and amputation. Longer-term analysis is needed to better assess durability."

    "abstract": "We report our experience with the urgent treatment of two high-risk patients with infected femoral artery pseudoaneurysms (IFAPs) with the placement of a self-expandable covered stent (SECS). In both cases, there was no perioperative mortality and the aneurysm exclusion was successful without early or late stent thrombosis/stent fracture nor acute or chronic limb ischemia or limb loss. There was no recurrence of local or systemic infection during the follow-up period. Endovascular therapy represents a feasible treatment option for IFAPs in those patients for whom the risk of open surgical repair would be prohibitive, especially under urgent circumstances."

    "abstract": "To determine the predictors of periprocedural blood transfusion and the association of transfusion on outcomes in high risk patients undergoing endoluminal percutaneous vascular interventions (PVI) for peripheral arterial disease. Between 2010-2014 at 47 hospitals participating in a statewide quality registry, 4.2% (n = 985) of 23,273 patients received a periprocedural blood transfusion. Transfusion rates varied from 0 to 15% amongst the hospitals in the registry. Using multiple logistic regression, factors associated with increased transfusion included female gender (OR = 1.9; 95% CI: 1.6-2.1), low creatinine clearance (1.3; 1.1-1.6), pre-procedural anemia (4.7; 3.9-5.7), family history of CAD (1.2; 1.1-1.5), CHF (1.4; 1.2-1.6), COPD (1.2; 1.1-1.4), CVD or TIA (1.2; 1.1-1.4), renal failure CRD (1.5; 1.2-1.9), pre-procedural heparin use (1.8; 1.4-2.3), warfarin use (1.2; 1.0-1.5), critical limb ischemia (1.7; 1.5-2.1), aorta-iliac procedure (1.9; 1.5-2.5), below knee procedure (1.3; 1.1-1.5), urgent procedure (1.7; 1.3-2.2), and emergent procedure (8.3; 5.6-12.4). Using inverse weighted propensity matching to adjust for confounders, transfusion was a significant risk factor for death (15.4; 7.5-31), MI (67; 29-150), TIA/stroke (24; 8-73) and ARF (19; 6.2-57). A focused QI program was associated with a 28% decrease in administration of blood transfusion (p = 0.001) over 4 years. In a large statewide PVI registry, post procedure transfusion was highly correlated with a specific set of clinical risk factors, and with in-hospital major morbidity and mortality. However, using a focused QI program, a significant reduction in transfusion is possible."

    "abstract": "Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) is an emergency procedure to manage severe hemorrhagic shock from torso injury but can cause severe ischemia of the lower extremities. However, lower extremity ischemia occurring as a complication of REBOA has been rarely reported. We describe the severe lower extremity ischemia caused by REBOA with a 12-Fr sheath in a small-built patient. The patient was a 16-year-old male who developed severe hemorrhagic shock due to abdominal blunt trauma. Following REBOA with a 12-Fr sheath on the right femoral artery, an emergency laparotomy and angiography to control the hemorrhage were performed. Twenty-eight hours after admission, suspecting lower extremity ischemia and compartment syndrome, we removed the sheath with a manual maneuver and performed fasciotomy. The limb ischemia was thus partially resolved. However, amputation was necessary because of ischemic necrosis on day 32. Our patient was physically small, and the diameter of his femoral artery on the contralateral site of sheath placement was also small. Therefore, disproportion of the sheath and femoral artery sizes may have caused the ischemic complication. Our experience highlights the importance of appropriate size selection for the sheath in line with the target vessel. We also recommend postoperative monitoring of limb perfusion in such cases with the use of near-infrared spectroscopy to facilitate the early detection of ischemia."

We report a case of acute aortic occlusion in a patient with chronic paralysis due to spinal cord injury. A 65-year-old man with chronic paralysis due to spinal cord injury developed mottling of the right extremity. Because of the complete tetraplegia, the patient had no subjective symptoms. Computed tomography revealed occlusion of the infrarenal abdominal aorta. An emergency thromboembolectomy established adequate blood flow, and the postoperative course was uneventful. The loss of muscle mass might be an advantage in avoiding ischemia reperfusion syndrome. Early detection of acute aortic occlusion and immediate reperfusion are primarily important, but patients with chronic paralysis present a risk of delay in detection, diagnosis, and treatment of acute aortic occlusion because of motor or sensory deficits. Although rare, it is necessary to consider acute aortic occlusion in the case of acute limb ischemia in patients with chronic paralysis due to spinal cord injury."

    "abstract": "The adductor canal compression syndrome is one of the several rare nontraumatic causes of arterial occlusions, which may lead to critical ischemia of the lower limb. We report the case of a 46-year-old athletic woman, who suffered from activity-related paresthesia and sharp pain in the left upper and lower leg for 2 years. Imaging and neurological investigations of the spine remained without pathological findings that would explain the patient's complaints. Actually, the patient presented with symptoms of critical lower limb ischemia. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed nearly complete thrombotic occlusion of the common femoral artery and the arteries of the lower leg. An emergency surgery was performed, revealing an external compression of the superficial femoral artery in the adductor canal. Subsequently, a thrombectomy was performed and a venous bypass graft was installed. No postoperative complications occurred, the patient recovered well and could return to her activities of daily living about 3 weeks after the surgery. The adductor canal compression syndrome results from a local anomalous musculotendinous band or hypertrophic musculature surrounding the passing structures. It mainly occurs in athletes exposed to repetitive stress, especially runners and skiers, and may lead to thrombosis followed by critical lower extremity ischemia. The lack of obvious symptoms during routine physical examination often impedes rapid diagnosis and timely therapy. Considering the high thrombotic risk, attention should be paid to this rare cause of lower limb pain to prevent the patient from critical lower extremity ischemia and potential limb loss due to consecutive acute thrombotic occlusions."

    "abstract": "Readmission rates after vascular surgery are among the highest within surgical specialties, and lower extremity bypass has the highest readmission rate of vascular surgery procedures. We analyzed how 30-day readmissions and risk factors for readmissions vary by indication for lower extremity bypass. We queried the 2012-2014 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program procedure-targeted vascular cohort to identify all patients who underwent lower extremity bypass. Emergent procedures and planned readmissions were excluded. Patients were stratified by surgical indication: claudication, critical limb ischemia rest pain (CLI RP), critical limb ischemia tissue loss (CLI TL), and other. The χ2 and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to test the differences between categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios for predictors of readmission adjusted for preoperative factors that were selected a priori. The overall 30-day readmission rate among the 6112 patients who underwent lower extremity bypass was 14.8%. Readmission rates varied significantly on the basis of the indication for surgery. In unadjusted comparisons, 18.8% of patients with CLI TL were readmitted compared with 16.5% with CLI RP, 9.4% with claudication, and 8.2% with other indications (P < .001). After adjustment for preoperative factors, 30-day readmissions were higher for patients with CLI TL (odds ratio, 1.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.35-2.06) and CLI RP (odds ratio, 1.70; 95% confidence interval, 1.38-2.09) compared with patients with claudication. The 30-day readmission rates after lower extremity bypass vary significantly by surgical indication. Because lower extremity bypasses are performed for multiple indications, if readmission rates are publically reported and hospitals can be penalized for higher than expected readmission rates, the expected readmission rates should be adjusted for surgical indication."

    "abstract": "A 77-year-old woman underwent emergency ascending aortic replacement for type A acute aortic dissection. Fifteen days after the operation, she had motor and sensory disturbances in the lower limbs. Computed tomography revealed multiple aortic thrombi and disrupted blood flow in the right external iliac and left common iliac arteries. She underwent an emergency thrombectomy for acute limb ischemia. Because heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia (HIT) was suspected to have caused the multiple aortic thrombi, we postoperatively changed the anticoagulant therapy from heparin to argatroban. Seventeen days after the first operation, gastrointestinal bleeding developed, and the patient died of mesenteric ischemia caused by HIT. Arterial embolization caused by HIT after cardiovascular surgery is a rare, but fatal event. To avoid fatal complications, early diagnosis and early treatment are essential. Use of a scoring system would probably facilitate early diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease, particularly critical limb ischemia, is an area with urgent need for optimized therapies because, to date, vascular interventions often have limited life spans. In spite of initial encouraging technical success after femoropopliteal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or stenting, postprocedural restenosis remains the major problem. The challenging idea behind the drug-coated balloon (DCB) concept is the biological modification of the injury response after balloon dilatation. Antiproliferative drugs administered via DCBs or drug-eluting stents are able to suppress neointimal hyperplasia, the main cause of restenosis. This article reviews the results of DCB treatments of femoropopliteal and infrapopliteal lesions in comparison to standard angioplasty with uncoated balloons. A systematic literature search was performed in 1) medical journals (ie, MEDLINE), 2) international registers for clinical studies (ie, www.clinicaltrials.gov), and 3) abstracts of scientific sessions. Several controlled randomized trials with follow-up periods of up to 5 years demonstrated the efficacy of paclitaxel -DCB technology. However, calcified lesions seem to affect the efficacy of DCB. Combinations of preconditioning methods with DCBs showed promising results. Although the mechanical abrasion of calcium via atherectomy or laser ablation showed favorable periprocedural results, the long-term impact on restenosis and clinical outcome has to be demonstrated. Major advantages of the DCBs are the rapid delivery of drug at uniform concentrations with a single dose, their efficacy in areas wherein stents have been contraindicated until now (ie, bifurcation, ostial lesions), and in leaving no stent scaffold behind. Reinterventions are easier to perform because DCBs leave no metal behind. Various combinations of DCBs with other treatment modalities may prove to be viable options in future. The follow-up results of clinical studies will evaluate the long-term impact of DCBs."

    "abstract": "Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is the advanced stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and associated with an extremely poor clinical outcome. In order to understand the possible role of circulating cytokines and poor outcome associated with CLI we compared the circulating cytokine profile of patients with CLI against patients with intermittent claudication (IC). The levels of 48 circulating cytokines were examined in 226 consecutive patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) admitted for elective, non-urgent, invasive treatment of IC or CLI. The PAD patient cohort was evenly distributed between subjects with IC (46.5%) and CLI (53.5%). As accustomed in PAD, CLI was associated with higher age, chronic kidney disease and diabetes when compared to IC (P < 0.01 for all). In multivariable linear regression modeling taking into account the baseline differences between IC and CLI groups CLI was independently associated with elevated levels of a large number of cytokines: IL-1β, IL-1ra, IL-2Rα, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ, GM-CSF, G-CSF (P < 0.01 for all), and IL-2, IL-7, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, bFGF, VEGF, SCGF-β (P < 0.05 for all). The current findings indicate that CLI is associated with a circulating cytokine profile, which resembles serious medical conditions such as severe pancreatitis, sepsis, or even cancer. Compared to IC, CLI is a systemic inflammatory condition, which may explain the extremely poor outcome associated with it."

Despite its time critical nature, little is known regarding the delays encountered during the patient pathway. The aim of this study was to identify sources of delay in the patient pathway at our institution. Sixty-seven cases of ALI of the lower extremities from 66 patients, who had presented to our center between May 2003 and April 2014, were identified for retrospective analysis. Data were retrieved from the patient records, discharge summaries and hospital laboratory, emergency department and radiology databases. Median time from onset of symptom to arrival at our institution was 11.35 hr (interquartile range [IQR] 6.27-72). Median cumulative time taken from arrival to vascular team review was 40 min (22.5-120), to imaging being performed was 4.75 hr (2.42-17.25), and to intervention being performed was 10.2 hr (4-31). There were significantly longer delays to presentation in those transferred from inpatient beds as compared with those transferred from the emergency department of other hospitals (66 hr [10.3-98] vs. 8 hr [5.6-14.9], P = 0.007). In total, 84.6% of patients underwent preoperative arterial imaging. Time taken from arrival to diagnostic arterial imaging was significantly longer in patients presenting out-of-ours (15 hr [6.5-20.75]) as compared with patients presenting in-hours (3.5 hr [2-6.5], P = 0.014) or during the weekend (2 hr [2-3], P = 0.022). Time from presentation to intervention was significantly shorter in patients presenting over the weekend (3.9 hr [2.6-5.1]) as compared with those presenting in-hours (14.2 hr [6.2-29], P = 0.006) and out-of-hours (16 hr [10-33], P = 0.021). Out-of-hours, a significant portion of the delay, was attributable to imaging (median time to imaging 15 hr). This study demonstrates the systematic nature of delays in the patient pathway from onset of symptoms to treatment. Several factors including time to patient presentation and time to imaging and delays in timely transfer to an appropriate facility contribute to this. Strategies need to be deployed to reduce time to revascularization."

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a deadly condition, particularly with rupture. Emergency physicians provide vital frontline care to the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) has become the gold standard for treatment of AAA, but the management of EVAR complications is not well discussed in the emergency medicine literature. The purpose of this article is to provide an emergency medicine-focused review of the complications of EVAR. Although many complications may arise after AAA repair, the most common include aortoenteric fistula, endoleak, limb ischemia, and graft infection. All potential complications should receive vascular surgery consultation and hemodynamic resuscitation. Aortoenteric fistula often presents nonspecifically with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Computed tomography with intravenous contrast is required for diagnosis. An endoleak is defined by vascular flow outside of the graft. The optimal diagnostic modality includes triple phase computed tomographic scan (noncontrast, arterial, delayed phase). Limb ischemia may occur before 2 months, or in a later period, with symptoms ranging from claudication to complete neurovascular compromise. Graft infection is most commonly due to Staphylococcus aureus, and imaging can suggest the diagnosis. Definitive diagnosis requires tissue or fluid sampling. Through an understanding of these complications, emergency physicians may improve patient outcomes. With the growing use of EVAR, emergency physician exposure to complications of this procedure is increasing. Knowledge of the complication presentations, diagnoses, and management can play an integral role patient care."

    "abstract": "Currently there is no data on peripheral arterial disease prevalence in Russia. To estimate prevalence of patients with symptomatic low limb ischemia (LLI) in Russian Federation on 2014. «League for patient' protection» had sent questionnaires for all regional health departments asking to name prevalence of ICD-10 codes I70.2 (atherosclerosis of arteries of extremities) and I73.1 (thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger)) on 2014. The figures were listed separately for ischemia I-IIa and III-IV (critical limb ischemia, CLI) (Pokrovsky, 1976). Also were mentioned major amputations and mortality. Total number of received questionnaires was 44, we've got information from all RF' federal regions with a population of appr. 71 million people. There were 174 125 cases of symptomatic LLI. Prevalence of symptomatic LLI among Russian population aged more than 40 years was 0.51%. Prevalence of intermittent claudication was 0.36% and of critical limb ischemia - 0.13%. Rate of major amputations was 6.9%. World PAD prevalence among people older than 25 years is 8.3%. The same figure in our study was only 0.5%. This is due to the fact that we considered only symptomatic LLI and only with codes I70.2 and I73.1. Prevalence of symptomatic patients among all PAD patients is 10-35%. So the real number of PAD patients in Russian might be 1.5-5%. We can conclude that PAD is still unrevealed in Russia. Another conclusion could be that the treatment results are less than satisfactory. Finally there is urgent necessity for special PAD register in RF. На сегодняшний день не проведено ни одного статистического исследования по определению распространенности ишемии конечностей среди взрослого населения РФ. Цель - оценить преваленс (распространенность) симптомной ишемии нижних конечностей (НК) в РФ на 2014 г. Материал и методы. Обрабатывали ответы на анкеты, разосланные в региональные министерства здравоохранения РФ с помощью 'Лиги защитников пациентов'. Использовали код I70.2 (атеросклероз артерий конечностей) по классификации МКБ-10, гораздо реже - I73.1 (облитерирующий тромбангиит). Отдельно выделяли случаи пациентов с ишемией I-II б стадии и случаи ишемии III-IV стадии по классификации А.В.  Покровского, учитывали также число выполненных ампутаций конечностей и летальность. Результаты. Общее число ответов на анкеты составило 44. Получена информация из всех федеральных округов РФ с суммарной численностью населения около 71 млн человек. Сообщается о 174 125 случаях проявляющихся клинически заболеваний периферических артерий (ПА). Среди населения старше 40 лет в РФ преваленс симптомной ишемии конечностей составил 0,51%, с перемежающейся хромотой (ПХ) - 0,36%, а с критической ишемией конечностей - 0,13%. Число ампутаций среди больных с диагнозами атеросклероз артерий конечности' или облитерирующий тромбангиит составило 6,9%. Выводы. По данным сборных статистик, преваленс заболевания ПА среди населения мира старше 25 лет составляет 8,3%. В нашем же опросе эта цифра составила всего 0,5%. Однако нужно учитывать, что в нашем статистическом опросе учитывалась симптомная ишемия только по кодам I70.2 и, гораздо реже, I73.1. Частота симптомной ишемии составляет от 10 до 35% среди всех пациентов с заболеваниями ПА. Поэтому реальное число больных с заболеваниями ПА среди взрослого населения может составлять 1,5-5%. В результате можно сделать вывод о недостаточной выявляемости подобных пациентов в РФ. Следует также констатировать, что по-прежнему результаты лечения заболевания ПА и, в частности, критической ишемии, остаются неудовлетворительными и сопровождаются высокими цифрами выполненных ампутаций и летальности. Помимо этого, существует настоятельная необходимость создания регистра учета подобных больных."

A minority of patients have persistent ischemia after central aortic repair and require peripheral arterial revascularization. We investigated whether the need for limb revascularization is associated with adverse outcomes. We reviewed our cases of AAD from 2000 to 2014 and identified patients with malperfusion syndromes (coronary, cerebral, spinal, visceral, renal, or peripheral ischemia). Patients with DeBakey I/II (Stanford type A) dissection had urgent open repair of the ascending aorta. Patients with DeBakey III (Stanford type B) dissection were initiated on anti-impulse medical therapy and had either open aortic repair or thoracic endovascular aortic repair for malperfusion syndromes. Patients with persistent lower limb ischemia after aortic repair usually had either extra-anatomic bypass grafting or iliac stenting. Some DeBakey III patients had peripheral revascularization without central aortic repair. We performed univariate and multivariate analysis to determine the effects of need for limb revascularization and clinical outcomes. We treated 1,015 AAD patients (501 [49.4%] DeBakey I/II and 514 [50.6%] DeBakey III) with a mean age of 59.7 ± 14.5 years (67.5% males). Aortic repair was performed in all DeBakey I/II patients and in 103 (20.0%) DeBakey III patients. Overall 30-day mortality was 11.3%. Lower limb ischemia was present in 104 (10.3%) patients and was more common in DeBakey I/II compared with DeBakey III dissections (65.4% vs. 34.6%; odds ratio [OR] 2.1, confidence interval [CI] 1.4-3.2; P = 0.001). Among the 40 patients who required limb revascularization, there was no difference in need for revascularization between DeBakey I/II and III patients. Patients requiring limb revascularization were more likely to have mesenteric ischemia compared with the rest of the cohort in both DeBakey I/II (P = 0.037) and DeBakey III dissections (P < 0.001) with worse 10-year survival (21.9 % vs. 59.2%, P < 0.001). When adjusted for other malperfusion syndromes, patients with limb revascularization had similar long-term survival compared to uncomplicated dissection patients (P = 0.960). Patients requiring lower limb revascularization after treatment for AAD are more likely to have mesenteric ischemia and worse survival. The need for limb revascularization is a marker for more extensive dissection and should prompt evaluation for visceral malperfusion."

    "title": "Nonoperative Management of Acute Upper Limb Ischemia.",
    "abstract": "Acute upper limb ischemia (AULI) is an uncommon emergency warranting immediate evaluation and treatment. The role of nonsurgical therapies including endovascular techniques, thrombolytics, and anticoagulation remains undefined. The authors systematically reviewed the current literature on the nonsurgical treatment of acute ischemia of the upper extremity. A PubMed and Embase search was conducted, and articles were screened using predetermined criteria. Data collected included patient demographics, cause of upper limb ischemia, type of nonsurgical treatment used, treatment outcomes, and complications. Patients were divided into 4 treatment groups: catheter embolectomy, catheter-directed thrombolysis, endovascular stenting, and anticoagulation/medical therapy alone. Twenty-three retrospective studies met the search criteria. Of 1326 reported occlusions, 92% (1221) were attributed to thromboembolic disease. The second most common cause was iatrogenic (1.5%). Overall limb salvage rates were excellent with catheter embolectomy (862 of 882 cases, 97.7%) and catheter-directed thrombolysis (110 of 114 cases, 96.5%). Limb salvage rates were also high with anticoagulation/medical therapy (158 of 165 cases, 95.8%), but poor functional outcomes were more often reported. High-quality evidence to guide the nonsurgical treatment of AULI is lacking. Retrospective studies support the utility of catheter-based embolectomy and thrombolysis for distal ischemia. Whether a surgical or nonsurgical approach is taken, anticoagulation therapy remains a mainstay of both treatment and prevention of AULI. Because AULI patients often have underlying cardiac and/or systemic disease, a multidisciplinary approach is essential to minimize complications and prevent future occurrences."

    "title": "Comparative Assessment of Medical Resource Use and Costs Associated with Patients with Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease in the United States.",
    "abstract": "There is growing concern about appropriate disease management for peripheral artery disease (PAD) because of the rapidly expanding population at risk for PAD and the high burden of illness associated with symptomatic PAD. A better understanding of the potential economic impact of symptomatic PAD relative to a matched control population may help improve care management for these patients. To compare the medical resource utilization, costs, and medication use for patients with symptomatic PAD relative to a matched control population. In this retrospective longitudinal analysis, the index date was the earliest date of a symptomatic PAD record (symptomatic PAD cohort) or any medical record (control cohort), and a period of 1 year pre-index and 3 years post-index was the study time frame. Symptomatic PAD patients and control patients (aged ≥ 18 years) enrolled in the MarketScan Commercial and Encounters database from January 1, 2006, to June 30, 2010, were identified. Symptomatic PAD was defined as having evidence of intermittent claudication (IC) and/or acute critical limb ischemia requiring medical intervention. Symptomatic PAD patients were selected using an algorithm comprising a combination of PAD-related ICD-9-CM diagnostic and diagnosis-related group codes, peripheral revascularization CPT-4 procedure codes, and IC medication National Drug Code numbers. Patients with stroke/transient ischemic attack, bleeding complications, or contraindications to antiplatelet therapy were excluded from the symptomatic PAD group but not the control group. A final 1:1 symptomatic PAD to control population with an exact match based on age, sex, index year, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was identified. Descriptive statistics comparing patient demographics, comorbidities, medical resource utilization, cost, and medication use outcomes were generated. Generalized linear models were developed to compare the outcomes while controlling for residual difference in demographics, comorbidities, pre-index resource use, and pre-index costs. 3,965 symptomatic PAD and 3,965 control patients were matched. In both cohorts, 54.7% were male, with a mean age (SD) of 69.0 (12.9) years and a CCI score of 1.3 (0.9). Symptomatic PAD patients had more cardiovascular comorbidities than control patients (27.7% vs. 12.6% coronary artery disease, 27.1% vs. 15.9% hyperlipidemia, and 49.8% vs. 28.2% hypertension) in the pre-index period. Post-index rates of ischemic stroke, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and cardiovascular- or PAD-related procedures (limb amputations, endovascular procedures, open surgical procedures, percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary artery bypass graft) were higher among symptomatic PAD patients versus control patients. All-cause annualized inpatient admissions (0.46 vs. 0.22 admissions), emergency department/urgent care days (0.27 vs. 0.22 days), and office visit days (12.5 vs. 10.2 days) were higher among symptomatic PAD versus control patients post-index. Annualized all-cause inpatient costs ($8,494 vs. $3,778); outpatient costs ($8,459 vs. $5,692); and total costs ($20,880 vs. $12,501) were higher among symptomatic PAD versus control patients post-index. Only 17.8% of symptomatic PAD patients versus 6.6% of control patients were on clopidogrel pre-index. In the post-index period, clopidogrel prescriptions in the symptomatic PAD population increased to 38.0%. Results were consistent in the regression models with the symptomatic PAD population having a higher number of all-cause post-index inpatient admissions, emergency department/urgent care days, office visit days, inpatient costs, outpatient costs, and total costs versus control patients (P ≤ 0.026). Symptomatic PAD patients have significantly higher medical resource use and costs when compared with a matched control population. As the prevalence of symptomatic PAD increases, there will be a significant impact on the population and health care system. The rates of use of evidence-based secondary prevention therapies, such as antiplatelet medication, were low. Therefore, greater effort must be made to increase utilization rates of appropriate treatments to determine if the negative economic and clinical impacts of symptomatic PAD can be minimized.

    "abstract": "Upper limb thromboembolism is a relatively uncommon clinical syndrome that mainly affects elderly patients with cardiovascular comorbidities. Atrial fibrillation has been recognized as the main cause. However, many other cardiac and non-cardiac disorders have been identified as possible sources of upper limb thromboemboli. From a clinical point of view, upper limb thromboembolism represents a vascular emergency so that the delay in diagnosis and treatment is highly likely to imply dramatic complications. Therefore, prompt recognition and treatment is mandatory as well as identification and correction of risk factors. Despite its clinical relevance, data in literature are lacking and sparse, most likely because upper limb thromboembolism has a relatively low prevalence in the general population. We sought to write a simple but comprehensive review of this topic, thus proving cardiologists and critical care physicians with the essential tools to recognize and treat upper limb thromboembolism, identifying and correcting also its risk factors and causes."

    "abstract": "Aortic occlusion (AO) for resuscitation in traumatic shock remains controversial. Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) offers an emerging alternative. The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Aortic Occlusion for Resuscitation in Trauma and Acute Care Surgery registry prospectively identified trauma patients requiring AO from eight ACS Level 1 centers. Presentation, intervention, and outcome variables were collected and analyzed to compare REBOA and open AO. From November 2013 to February 2015, 114 AO patients were captured (REBOA, 46; open AO, 68); 80.7% were male, and 62.3% were blunt injured. Aortic occlusion occurred in the emergency department (73.7%) or the operating room (26.3%). Hemodynamic improvement after AO was observed in 62.3% [REBOA, 67.4%; open OA, 61.8%); 36.0% achieving stability (systolic blood pressure consistently >90 mm Hg, >5 minutes); REBOA, 22 of 46 (47.8%); open OA, 19 of 68 (27.9%); p =0.014]. Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) access was femoral cut-down (50%); US guided (10.9%) and percutaneous without imaging (28.3%). Deployment was achieved in Zones I (78.6%), II (2.4%), and III (19.0%). A second AO attempt was required in 9.6% [REBOA, 2 of 46 (4.3%); open OA, 9 of 68 (13.2%)]. Complications of REBOA were uncommon (pseudoaneurysm, 2.1%; embolism, 4.3%; limb ischemia, 0%). There was no difference in time to successful AO between REBOA and open procedures (REBOA, 6.6 ± 5.6 minutes; open OA, 7.2 ± 15.1; p = 0.842). Overall survival was 21.1% (24 of 114), with no significant difference between REBOA and open AO with regard to mortality [REBOA, 28.2% (13 of 46); open OA, 16.1% (11 of 68); p = 0.120]. Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta has emerged as a viable alternative to open AO in centers that have developed this capability. Further maturation of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Aortic Occlusion for Resuscitation in Trauma and Acute Care Surgery database is required to better elucidate optimal indications and outcomes.

    "abstract": "Late-presenting acute limb ischaemia represents a challenging vascular emergency. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome in patients following revascularization and management of existing or impending reperfusion injury of ischaemic limbs over a 12-year period (2002-2014). Routine procedural codes were used to label consecutive patients admitted 72 hours following onset of symptoms for surgical revascularization of an acutely ischaemic limb. Data collected included demography, clinical presentation, synchronous morbidities, procedural specifics and outcomes of surgical management of all patients. The study sample included 206 patients, (117 male and 89 female, average age =49.4±14.6 years) presenting with a diagnosis of acute limb ischemia. The most frequent cause of acute thromboembolic limbs was cardiac disease (n=148). Femoral artery exploration with embolectomy was the most common procedure and was used for aortic, iliac, infrainguinal and distal occlusion. Thirty-four patients required additional vascular surgery due to failure of revascularization by embolectomy. Fasciotomy was performed in 45.6% of cases for existing or impending compartment syndrome when the patient presented very late. Surgical site infection occurred in 8.25% of cases, repeat embolectomy was required in 10.68% of cases; amputation in 13.1% and mortality was 5.8%. Predictors of morbidity and mortality included age of the patient, time of presentation and specific comorbidities. The 5-year amputation-free and survival estimate was 80%. Our study suggests that late revascularization of acute leg ischaemia improves blood supply to the limb, thereby reducing the number of amputations. The results suggest that revascularization is clinically warranted, even one week following the onset of acute ischaemia. Additional surgical procedures including fasciotomy further reduce the morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "Lack of a reliable outcome measure often leads to excessive or insufficient interventions for critical limb ischemia (CLI). SPY technology (Novadaq Technologies Inc, Bonita Springs, Fla), widely adapted by plastic and general surgeons, uses laser-assisted fluorescence angiography (LAFA) to assess tissue perfusion. We sought to determine the role of SPY as an alternative, perhaps more reliable outcome measure for vascular interventions. All patients undergoing elective or urgent revascularization for claudication and CLI were prospectively recruited from June 2012 to August 2014. LAFA using SPY technology was performed before and after revascularization procedures under a standard Institutional Review Board-approved protocol. Quantitative measures of perfusion at plantar surfaces were analyzed and compared with ankle-brachial index. A total of 93 patients with claudication or CLI underwent LAFA before and after a revascularization procedure in the study period. The mean preoperative ankle-brachial index increased from 0.60 to 0.84 (P < .001) after a revascularization procedure. Plantar perfusion as measured by LAFA also improved significantly after intervention. Ingress, defined as the rate at which fluorescence intensity increases on the plantar surface during LAFA, increased from 7.1 to 12.4 units/s (P < .001). Peak perfusion, defined as the difference between the baseline and the peak of fluorescence intensity, increased from 97.1 and 143.9 units (P < .001). Egress, defined as the rate at which intensity diminishes after reaching peak perfusion, increased from 1.0 to 1.9 units/s (P = .035). Procedure-related digital embolization was also observed in several patients despite lack of an angiographic finding. This is the largest prospective study evaluating SPY technology in peripheral vascular interventions. Our study shows that SPY is a valuable tool in visualizing real-time procedural outcomes and providing additionally useful information on regional tissue perfusion. Further investigation is warranted to standardize outpatient use and to determine threshold values that predict wound healing."

    "abstract": "Current intra-arterial catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) protocols recommend treatment with small doses of a thrombolytic agent, which excludes patients in need of urgent revascularization. We evaluated the effects of accelerated thrombolysis utilizing increased recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) doses. Forty-one patients with acute, thrombotic limb ischemia (ALI) were treated using accelerated CDT. The treatment consisted of an initial dose of 10 mg rt-PA for 30 minutes followed by a 3-hour course of a continuous intra-arterial 10 mg/hour rt-PA infusion. Simultaneously, intravenous unfractionated heparin (500 IU/hour) was administered. No deaths occurred. Satisfactory lysis was achieved in 37 of the 41 patients (90.2%). All significant underlying lesions were corrected (89.2%). Complications developed in nine patients (22%); the most frequent complication (four patients, 9.8%) was puncture site hematoma. The reintervention rate was 2.6% and 15.4% at the 1 and 6-month follow-ups, respectively. The major amputation rate was 10.3% and 12.8% at the 1 and 6-month follow-ups, respectively. Outflow compromise was adversely related to successful outcome at the 6-month follow-up (p=0.01). In conclusion, this study confirms the effectiveness and safety of the accelerated CDT regimen for treatment of thrombotic ALI at a single center, but requires confirmation in further studies."

    "abstract": "Debate regarding the optimal cannulation site for aortic surgery continues. We report our recent experience with a simple and rapid open Seldinger-guided technique for femoral cannulation. Aside from speed and simplicity (no need for arterial incision or suture closure), this technique has the added benefit that the distal limb continues to be perfused, as no arterial snare is required. We recently began routinely utilizing an open Seldinger-guided technique for femoral artery cannulation. The artery is exposed surgically but cannulated by guidewire inside a pursestring without arterial incision. The pursestring is simply tied when decannulation is performed. We report our experience with the routine application of this technique from August 2011 to April 2015. We reviewed the outcome of 337 consecutive peripheral arterial cannulations performed for thoracic aortic surgery (303 femoral, 34 axillary) using the open Seldinger technique. Within the femoral cannulation group, the hospital survival rate was 97% (295 of 303). The survival rate for elective operations was 98% (277 of 283), and 90% (18 of 20) for emergent/urgent. Seldinger-guided femoral cannulation was performed for replacement of the ascending/aortic arch in 88% (266 of 303), the descending thoracic aorta in 7% (22 of 303), and the thoracoabdominal aorta in 5% (15 of 303). There were no instances of intraoperative malperfusion phenomena, arterial dissection, or vascular injury or rupture. No patients had postoperative acute limb ischemia. Local wound complications were observed in 1% of patients (3 of 303). The stroke rate was 1.6% (5 of 303). The same open Seldinger technique was also used without complication in the axillary cannulation group. An open Seldinger-guided femoral (or axillary) cannulation technique is quick and easy to perform, with minimal vascular or other complications and extremely low risk of stroke. This technique is recommended for its speed, simplicity, and effectiveness, and for its preservation of distal arterial flow (which is occluded with the traditional arterial incision/arterial snare technique)."

AS is self-limiting and a non-urgent surgical condition. It can be differentiated from other pathologies by clinical spectrum, patient demographics and in doubtful circumstances (acute limb ischemia) by Doppler sonography. An algorithmic approach can avoid hospital admissions, partially unnecessary investigation and assist in patient assurance."

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the predictive value of 2 established risk models for surgical mortality in a contemporary cohort of patients undergoing repair of acute type-A aortic dissection. Retrospective analysis. Single tertiary care hospital. Seventy-nine consecutive patients undergoing emergent repair of acute type-A aortic dissection between 2008 and 2013. All patients underwent emergent repair of acute type-A aortic dissection. The receiver operating characteristic curve was compared for each scoring system. Of the 79 patients undergoing emergent repair of acute type-A aortic dissection, 23 (29.1%) were above the age of 70. Seventeen (21.5%) patients presented with hypotension, 25 (31.6%) presented with limb ischemia, and 10 (12.7%) presented with evidence of visceral ischemia. Overall operative mortality was 16.5%. Increasing age was the only preoperative variable associated with increased operative mortality. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for operative mortality was 0.62 and 0.66 for the scoring systems developed by Rampoldi et al and Centofanti et al, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for operative mortality for age was 0.67. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for operative mortality between the 2 scoring systems and for age were not statistically different. Existing predictive risk models for acute type-A aortic dissection provide moderate discriminatory power for operative mortality. Age as a single variable may provide equivalent discriminatory power for operative mortality as the established risk models."

A retrospective assessment of 214 SFA stent procedures between 2003 and 2012 was conducted from a prospectively compiled database. Patency rates and patient outcomes were compiled from case notes and computerized records. Stent patency was confirmed by either duplex scan or clinical examination (palpable distal pulse). Survival and patency were compared across a range of factors using Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank tests. Factors found to be significant were further assessed by Cox regression models. Data were analyzed for 214 limbs in 205 patients. Inclusion criteria included those patients who received an SFA stent for treatment of claudication or critical limb ischemia (CLI) with follow-up data. This gave a study group of 151 limbs divided into 76 claudicant and 75 patients with CLI (male-female ratio = 103:48, mean age 71 years, standard deviation 11.7). Seventy-one percent of procedures were elective and 29% were emergency procedures; 53% of procedures were carried out on a day case basis. Median follow-up was 11 months (range 1 day-89 months). Patency was significantly worse for patients with CLI (P = .009), with a 1- and 3-year patency of 63% and 34% compared to 79% and 60% in patients with claudication. Significant factors associated with patency included oral therapy controlled diabetes (P = .003), lesions located in either the mid-SFA (P = .029) or the mid-popliteal (P = .013), and periprocedural complications (P = .005). There was no significant difference in patency rates between insulin-dependent and nondiabetic patients (hazard ratio: 1.0, 95% confidence interval: 0.4-5.6, P = .983). The overall amputation rate for the total study group was 5%. Patients with 1- and 3-year survival were 98% and 96% in the claudication group and 74% and 51%, respectively, in the CLI group. SFA stents have superior outcomes in claudicants. Patency is related to severity of disease, diabetes, and location of disease."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is a highly morbid and fatal vascular emergency with little known about contemporary, long-term patient outcomes. The goal was to determine predictors of long-term mortality and amputation after open and endovascular treatment of ALI. A retrospective review of ALI patients at a single institution from 2005 to 2011 was performed to determine the impact of revascularization technique on 5-year mortality and amputation. For each main outcome 2 multivariable models were developed; the first adjusted for preoperative clinical presentation and procedure type, the second also adjusted for postoperative adverse events (AEs). A total of 445 limbs in 411 patients were treated for ALI. Interventions included surgical thrombectomy (48%), emergent bypass (18%), and endovascular revascularization (34%). Mean age was 68 ± 15 years, 54% were male, and 23% had cancer. Most patients presented with Rutherford classification IIa (54%) or IIb (39%). The etiology of ALI included embolism (27%), in situ thrombosis (28%), thrombosed bypass grafts (32%), and thrombosed stents (13%). Patients treated with open procedures had significantly more advanced ischemia and higher rates of postoperative respiratory failure, whereas patients undergoing endovascular interventions had higher rates of technical failure. Rates of postprocedural bleeding and cardiac events were similar between both treatments. Excluding Rutherford class III patients (n = 12), overall 5-year mortality was 54% (stratified by treatment, 65% for thrombectomy, 63% for bypass, and 36% for endovascular, P < 0.001); 5-year amputation was 28% (stratified by treatment, 18% for thrombectomy, 27% for bypass, and 17% for endovascular, P = 0.042). Adjusting for comorbidities, patient presentation, AEs, and treatment method, the risk of mortality increased with age (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.04, P < 0.001), female gender (HR = 1.50, P = 0.031), cancer (HR = 2.19, P < 0.001), fasciotomy (HR = 1.69, P = 0.204) in situ thrombosis or embolic etiology (HR = 1.73, P = 0.007), cardiac AEs (HR = 2.25, P < 0.001), respiratory failure (HR = 2.72, P < 0.001), renal failure (HR = 4.70, P < 0.001), and hemorrhagic events (HR = 2.25, P = 0.003). Risk of amputation increased with advanced ischemia (Rutherford IIb compared with IIa, HR = 2.57, P < 0.001), thrombosed bypass etiology (HR = 3.53, P = 0.002), open revascularization (OR; HR = 1.95, P = 0.022), and technical failure of primary intervention (HR = 6.01, P < 0.001). After the treatment of ALI, long-term mortality and amputation rates were greater in patients treated with open techniques; OR patients presented with a higher number of comorbidities and advanced ischemia, while also experiencing a higher rate of major postoperative complications. Overall, mortality rates remained high and were most strongly associated with baseline comorbidities, acuity of presentation, and perioperative AEs, particularly respiratory failure. Comparatively, amputation risk was most highly associated with advanced ischemia, thrombosed bypass, and failure of the initial revascularization procedure."

    "abstract": "Rates of surgical site infections (SSIs) following groin incision for femoral artery exposure are much higher than expected of a clean operation. The morbidity and mortality is high, particularly with the use of prosthetic grafts. The vascular surgery population is at an increased risk of SSIs related to peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes, obesity, previous surgery and presence of tissue loss. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) dressings have been used on primarily closed incisions to reduce surgical site infections in other surgical disciplines. We have not come across any randomized controlled trials to support the prophylactic use of negative pressure wound therapy in high-risk vascular patients undergoing lower limb revascularization. In this single-center, prospective randomized controlled trial, patients scheduled for a lower limb revascularization requiring open femoral artery exposure who are at a high risk (BMI > 30 kg/m(2), previous femoral cutdown or Rutherford V or VI category for chronic limb ischemia) will be eligible for the study. A total of 108 groin incisions will be randomized to the use of a negative pressure wound device or standard adhesive gauze dressing. Patients will be followed in hospital and reassessed within the first 30 days postoperatively. The primary outcome is SSI within the first 30 days of surgery and will be determined using the intention-to-treat principle. Secondary outcomes include length of stay, emergency room visits, reoperation, amputation and mortality. A cost analysis will be performed. The trial is expected to define the role of NPWT in SSI prophylaxis for lower limb revascularization in high-risk vascular patients. The results of the study will be used to inform current best practice for perioperative care and the minimization of SSIs. NCT02084017 , March 2014."

    "abstract": "In an emergency, a general surgeon may be faced with the need to treat arterial trauma of the extremities when specialized vascular surgery is not available in their hospital setting, either because an arterial lesion was not diagnosed during pre-admission triage, or because of iatrogenic arterial injury. The need for urgent control of hemorrhage and limb ischemia may contra-indicate immediate transfer to a hospital with a specialized vascular surgery service. For a non-specialized surgeon, hemostasis and revascularization rely largely on damage control techniques and the use of temporary vascular shunts (TVS). Insertion of a TVS is indicated for vascular injuries involving the proximal portion of extremity vessels, while hemorrhage from distal arterial injuries can be treated with simple arterial ligature. Proximal and distal control of the injured vessel must be obtained, followed by proximal and distal Fogarty catheter thrombectomy and lavage with heparinized saline. The diameter of the TVS should be closely approximated to that of the artery; use of an oversized TVS may result in intimal tears. Systematic performance of decompressive fasciotomy is recommended in order to prevent compartment syndrome. In the immediate postoperative period, the need for systematic use of anticoagulant or anti-aggregant medications has not been demonstrated. The patient should be transferred to a specialized center for vascular surgery as soon as possible. The interval before definitive revascularization depends on the overall condition of the patient. The long-term limb conservation results after placement of a TVS are identical to those obtained when initial revascularization is performed."

    "abstract": "Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) requires urgent decision-making and high-quality skills, which may not be uniformly available throughout the week. Few data exist on the outcomes of patients with cardiac arrest who receive in-hospital ECPR on the weekday versus weekend. Therefore, we investigated whether the outcome differed when patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest received ECPR during the weekend compared with a weekday. Two hundred patients underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation after in-hospital cardiac arrest between January 2004 and December 2013. Patients treated between 0800 on Monday to 1759 on Friday were considered to receive weekday care and patients treated between 1800 on Friday through 0759 on Monday were considered to receive weekend care. A total of 135 cases of ECPR for in-hospital cardiac arrest occurred during the weekday (64 during daytime hours and 71 during nighttime hours), and 65 cases occurred during the weekend (39 during daytime/evening hours and 26 during nighttime hours). Rates of survival to discharge were higher with weekday care than with weekend care (35.8% versus 21.5%, p = 0.041). Cannulation failure was more frequent in the weekend group (1.5% versus 7.7%, p = 0.038). Complication rates were higher on the weekend than on the weekday, including cannulation site bleeding (3.0% versus 10.8%, p = 0.041), limb ischemia (5.9% versus 15.6%, p = 0.026), and procedure-related infections (0.7% versus 9.2%, p = 0.005). ECPR on the weekend was associated with a lower survival rate and lower resuscitation quality, including higher cannulation failure and higher complication rate."

    "abstract": "Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO(1)) systems are a life-saving option in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS(2)), but may be encumbered by severe vascular complications in the groin. A pregnant woman was admitted with respiratory failure due to H1N1 influenza. VA-ECMO was inserted percutaneously by the intensivists and then accidentally removed by the patient after 8 days. 24h later VA-ECMO was reinstalled with surgical denudation of femoral vessels in another department. 2h later, due to active bleeding and signs of limb ischemia, the patient was referred to our department and emergency trombectomy and patch angioplasty with PTFE were performed. Evolution was further bad with wound infection (Pseudomonas, Proteus), which imposed large debridement, replacing the PTFE patch with 2 parallel venous patches and wound reconstruction through sartorius muscle rotation. The wound underwent negative pressure therapy for 10 days and was skin grafted. The patient recovered under systemic antibiotic and virostatic therapy. Major complications of using VA-ECMO devices are related to vascular access, most common bleeding at the puncture site and acute limb ischemia. In the groin, sartorius muscle flap is the most used for vascular coverage and small tissue defect reconstruction because of the ease in harvesting and low donor-site complications. Although ischemic complications associated with VA-ECMO are accepted by intensivists under the slogan \"leg for life\", for the repair of the femoral artery in the presence of groin infection the sartorius muscle remains an efficient solution for limb salvage."

The occurrence of MACE, defined as composite endpoint of acute myocardial infarction, urgent coronary revascularization, stroke, and death was assessed in 319 consecutive PAD patients admitted to the University Hospital between January 2010 and January 2014 (66.5% men, mean [±standard deviation] age 70±10 years, mean ankle brachial index 0.58±0.14) with normal LVEF (>50%). Multivariate Cox regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, traditional cardiovascular risk factors, anemia, polyvascular disease, critical limb ischemia (CLI), statin treatment, CRP (>5 mg/L), and impaired renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min) was applied to assess the independent predictors of MACE. During median follow-up period of 24 months (interquartile range, 16-34 months), 77 patients (24%) experienced MACE. Compared to patients without MACE, these patients were older, more likely to have CLI, polyvascular disease, anemia, elevated CRP, and impaired renal function. In multivariate regression analysis, age (HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07), polyvascular disease (HR 1.95, 95% CI 1.23-3.09), elevated CRP (HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.18-3.02), and impaired renal function (HR 1.68, 95% C 1.01-2.78) remained independent predictors of MACE. Patients with both impaired renal function and high CRP values on admission were 3.59 times more likely to experience MACE than patients with normal CRP and preserved renal function. Elevated admission CRP and renal impairment are independent predictors of MACE in symptomatic PAD patients with preserved LVEF."

    "abstract": "Our objective was to analyze periprocedural and 1-year outcomes of peripheral endovascular intervention (PVI) for critical limb ischemia (CLI). We reviewed 1244 patients undergoing 1414 PVIs for CLI (rest pain, 29%; tissue loss, 71%) within the Vascular Study Group of New England (VSGNE) from January 2010 to December 2011. Overall survival (OS), amputation-free survival (AFS), and freedom from major amputation at 1 year were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The number of arteries treated during each procedure were 1 (49%), 2 (35%), 3 (12%), and ≥4 (5%). Target arterial segments and TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus classifications were aortoiliac, 27% (A, 48%; B, 28%; C, 12%; and D, 12%); femoral-popliteal, 48% (A, 29%; B, 34%; C, 20%; and D, 17%); and infrapopliteal, 25% (A, 17%; B, 14%; C, 25%; D, 44%). Technical success was 92%. Complications included access site hematoma (5.0%), occlusion (0.3%), and distal embolization (2.4%). Mortality and major amputation rates were 2.8% and 2.2% at 30 days, respectively. Overall percutaneous or open reintervention rate was 8.0% during the first year. At 1-year, OS, AFS, and freedom from major amputation were 87%, 87%, and 94% for patients with rest pain and 80%, 71%, and 81% for patients with tissue loss. Independent predictors of reduced 1-year OS (C index = .74) included dialysis (HR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.8-5.1; P < .01), emergency procedure (HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.0-6.2; P = .05), age >80 years (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.7-2.8; P < .01), not living at home preoperatively (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.4-2.8; P < .01), creatinine >1.8 mg/dL (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3-2.8; P < .01), congestive heart failure (HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.2; P < .01), and chronic β-blocker use (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.9; P = .03), whereas independent preoperative ambulation (HR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6-0.9; P = .014) was protective. Independent predictors of major amputation (C index = .69) at 1 year included dialysis (HR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6-4.5; P < .01), tissue loss (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.7; P = .02), prior major contralateral amputation (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.5; P = .02), non-Caucasian race (HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0-2.9; P = .045), and male gender (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.6; P = .03), whereas smoking (HR, .60; 95% CI, 0.4-1.0; P = .042) was protective. Survival and major amputation after PVI for CLI are associated with different patient characteristics. Dialysis dependence is a common predictor that portends especially poor outcomes. These data may facilitate efforts to improve patient selection and, after further validation, enable risk-adjusted outcome reporting for CLI patients undergoing PVI."

Of 174 patients, 37 were readmitted within 30 days of discharge. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the readmitted and the nonreadmitted groups. In a multivariate logistic regression model, urgent operation and advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) were associated with increased risk of 30-day readmission. The most common reasons for readmission were infection of the surgical site or index limb (18 of 37), followed by unresolved limb symptoms (13 of 37). The 30-day readmission is frequent after lower extremity interventions to treat PAD. Urgent operative intervention and advanced CKD appear to be risk factors for early hospital readmission."

In contrast to SSI that develops while patients are still hospitalized, little is known about the cohort of patients who develop SSI after discharge. In this study, we explore the factors that lead to postdischarge SSI, investigate the differences between risk factors for in-hospital vs postdischarge SSI, and develop a scoring system to identify patients who might benefit from postdischarge monitoring of their wounds. Patients who underwent major vascular surgery from 2005 to 2012 for aneurysm and lower extremity occlusive disease were identified from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Participant Use Files. Patients were categorized as having no SSI, in-hospital SSI, or SSI after hospital discharge. Predictors of postdischarge SSI were determined by multivariable logistic regression and internally validated by bootstrap resampling. Risk scores were assigned to all significant variables in the model. Summative risk scores were collapsed into quartile-based ordinal categories and defined as low, low/moderate, moderate/high, and high risk. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine predictors of in-hospital SSI. Of the 49,817 patients who underwent major vascular surgery, 4449 (8.9%) were diagnosed with SSI (2.1% in-hospital SSI; 6.9% postdischarge SSI). By multivariable analysis, factors significantly associated with increased odds of postdischarge SSI include female gender, obesity, diabetes, smoking, hypertension, coronary artery disease, critical limb ischemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dyspnea, neurologic disease, prolonged operative time >4 hours, American Society of Anesthesiology class 4 or 5, lower extremity revascularization or aortoiliac procedure, and groin anastomosis. The model exhibited moderate discrimination (bias-corrected C statistic, 0.691) and excellent internal calibration. The postdischarge SSI rate was 2.1% for low-risk patients, 5.1% for low/moderate-risk patients, 7.8% for moderate/high-risk patients, and 14% for high-risk patients. In a comparative analysis, comorbidities were the primary driver of postdischarge SSI, whereas in-hospital factors (operative time, emergency case status) and complications predicted in-hospital SSI. The majority of SSIs after major vascular surgery develop following hospital discharge. We have created a scoring system that can select a cohort of patients at high risk for SSI after discharge. These patients can be targeted for transitional care efforts focused on early detection and treatment with the goal of reducing morbidity and preventing readmission secondary to SSI."

A total of 1425 consecutive patients with non-emergency spine surgery underwent a PAD screening using ABI measurement. We reviewed their ABI data, age, smoking status, and co-morbidities including diabetes mellitus (DM), cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and ischemic heart disease (IHD). CT- or MR-angiography was used for a definitive diagnosis of PAD when the ABI was 0.9 or less. Of 1425 patients, 37 patients (2.5%) showed less than 0.9 in ABI; 24 patients (1.6%) were eventually diagnosed as PAD. Of 24 patients with PAD, 22 patients (91.6%) were over 65 years. The prevalence of DM was 58.3% in the PAD group versus 18.7% in the non-PAD group (P < 0.05). Patients with CVD or IHD were more likely to have PAD, but the differences were not significant. Smoking rate was 62.5% in the PAD group versus 42.4% in the non-PAD group (P < 0.05). The current preoperative PAD screening data showed that age over 65 years, DM and smoking habit were the risk factors for PAD development. Based on the current results, we advocate preoperative ABI measurement for over 50-year patients who had co-morbidities and/or smoking habit and all the patients aged 65 years or more."

We searched the English language references from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, TOXNET, and gray literature that featured one or more case descriptions of phenytoin- or fosphenytoin-associated PGS after administration and provided information on the clinical setting of the event and associated outcome(s). Descriptive statistics were employed to summarize relevant facts about the cases. We identified 82 unique cases of parenteral phenytoin-associated PGS and 5 cases of fosphenytoin-associated PGS that were published from 1984 to 2015. Additionally, we found two cases of PGS associated with oral formulation of phenytoin published from 1999 to 2015. The spectrum of tissue injury ranged from mild local cutaneous reactions around the infusion site to frank limb ischemia. Just over a half of cases reported symptoms after one dose of IV phenytoin. Pathologic findings included evidence for microvascular thrombosis and possible microvascular or subclinical extravasation as a contributing mechanism. Dopper ultrasound and conventional angiography were used in some patients to identify arterial or venous thrombosis. Various treatments were documented including the use of supportive care such as limb elevation and heat or cold application, utilization of systemic antibiotics, anticoagulants, or vasodilators, and local infiltration of hyaluronidase, heparin, or other compounds. In a small number of patients, invasive interventions such as regional anesthesia, thrombectomy, fasciotomy, and debridement were described. Time to resolution varied from days to weeks. Resolution of PGS without deficits was documented in the majority of cases. Skin changes followed by sensory and motor deficits were described in 16, 6, and 5 cases, respectively. Four patients underwent skin grafting and eight patients required limb amputation. Death as a result of PGS was documented in two patients. PGS associated with oral and injectable phenytoin or parenteral fosphenytoin has been documented in the literature and sometimes includes significant vascular thrombosis and potentially limb-threatening ischemia. Avoidance of small hand veins, adherence to recommended IV administration guidelines and monitoring of the infusion site for reactions should be considered to decrease the morbidity of IV phenytoin or fosphenytoin use. Patients with PGS and evidence of decreased distal perfusion should undergo prompt vascular imaging and potential intervention to avoid ischemic sequelae. Alternative anticonvulsant drugs should be considered in patients at risk for PGS when possible."

We used a prospective database to review patients who underwent placement of an Impella left ventricular assist device in our tertiary referral center from July 2010 to December 2013. Patient demographics, comorbidities, interventional complications, and 30-day mortality were recorded. The study included 90 patients (60% male). Mean age was 66 years (range, 17-97 years). Hypertension was found in 69% of the patients, 37% were diabetic, 57% had a history of tobacco abuse, and 65% had chronic renal insufficiency. The median preprocedure cardiac ejection fraction was 30%. Most (87%) had undergone coronary artery intervention. Cardiogenic shock was documented in 67 patients (74%). The Impella was placed for an average of 1 day (range, 0-5 days). At least one vascular complication occurred in 15 patients (17%). Acute limb ischemia occurred in 12 patients; of whom four required an amputation and six required open or endovascular surgery. Other complications included groin hematomas and one pseudoaneurysm. All-patient 30-day mortality was 50%, which was not significantly associated with vascular complications. Female sex and cardiogenic shock at the time of insertion were associated with vascular complications (P = .043 and P = .018, respectfully). Vascular complications are common with placement of the Impella percutaneous left ventricular assist device (17%) and are related to emergency procedures. Vascular complications in this high-risk patient population frequently lead to withdrawal of care. These data provide quality improvement targets for left ventricular assist device programs."

Vorapaxar offers a unique mechanism for platelet inhibition via the antagonism of protease-activated receptor-1. It is approved for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) or PAD. This new drug approval was mainly based on the results from subgroup analyses from a large landmark trial (Thrombin Receptor Antagonist in Secondary Prevention of Atherothrombotic Ischemic Events-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 50), which found that vorapaxar reduces the rate of the combined end point of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, and urgent coronary revascularization when used in addition to aspirin and/or clopidogrel in patients without a history of stroke. In this study, vorapaxar was discontinued in patients with a history of stroke due to excessive risk for intracranial hemorrhage after 2 years of therapy. As an adjunctive therapy to standard regimens, vorapaxar provides a greater net clinical benefit in MI patients who are at a lower risk for bleeding. In patients with PAD, it reduces the rates of recurrent acute limb ischemia with rehospitalization or peripheral revascularization. The most concerning adverse effect is bleeding. Vorapaxar should not be used in patients with a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, intracranial hemorrhage, or active pathological bleeding. The risks and benefits of adding vorapaxar to intensify antiplatelet regimens should be assessed in individual patients to aim for additional therapeutic outcomes with minimal bleeding risks."

    "abstract": "Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) is one of the ultimately invasive procedures for managing a noncompressive torso injury. Since it is less invasive than resuscitative open aortic cross-clamping, its clinical application is expected. We retrospectively evaluated the safety and clinical feasibility of REBOA (intra-aortic occlusion balloon, MERA, Tokyo, Japan) using the Seldinger technique to control severe hemorrhage. Of 5,230 patients admitted to our trauma center in Japan from 2007 to 2013, we included 24 who underwent REBOA primarily. The indications for REBOA were a pelvic ring fracture or hemoperitoneum with hemodynamically instability and impending cardiac arrest. Emergency hemostasis was performed during REBOA in all patients. All 24 patients had a blunt injury, the median age was 59 (interquartile range, 41-71 years), the median Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 47 (interquartile range, 37-52), the 30-day survival rate was 29.2% (n = 7), and the median probability survival rate was 12.5%. Indications for REBOA were hemoperitoneum and pelvic ring fracture in 15 cases and overlap in 8 cases. In 10 cases of death, the balloon could not be deflated in 5 cases. In 19 cases in which the balloon was deflated, the median duration of aortic occlusion was shorter in survivors than in deaths (21 minutes vs. 35 minutes, p = 0.05). The mean systolic blood pressure was significantly increased by REBOA (from 53.1 [21] mm Hg to 98.0 [26.6] mm Hg, p < 0.01). There were three cases with complications (12.5%), one external iliac artery injury and two lower limb ischemias in which lower limb amputation was necessary in all cases. Acute kidney injury developed in all three cases, but failure was not persistent. REBOA seems to be feasible for trauma resuscitation and may improve survivorship. However, the serious complication of lower limb ischemia warrants more research on its safety. Therapeutic/care management, level V."

    "title": "Endovascular intervention for peripheral artery disease.",
    "abstract": "Advances in endovascular therapies during the past decade have broadened the options for treating peripheral vascular disease percutaneously. Endovascular treatment offers a lower risk alternative to open surgery in many patients with multiple comorbidities. Noninvasive physiological tests and arterial imaging precede an endovascular intervention and help localize the disease and plan the procedure. The timing and need for revascularization are broadly related to the 3 main clinical presentations of claudication, critical limb ischemia, and acute limb ischemia. Many patients with claudication can be treated by exercise and medical therapy. Endovascular procedures are considered when these fail to improve quality of life and function. In contrast, critical limb ischemia and acute limb ischemia threaten the limb and require more urgent revascularization. In general, endovascular treatments have greater long-term durability for aortoiliac disease than femoral popliteal disease. Infrapopliteal revascularization is generally reserved for critical and acute limb ischemia. Balloon angioplasty and stenting are the mainstays of endovascular therapy. New well-tested innovations include drug-eluting stents and drug-coated balloons. Adjunctive devices for crossing chronic total occlusions or debulking plaque with atherectomy are less rigorously studied and have niche roles. Patients receiving endovascular procedures need a structured surveillance plan for follow-up care. This includes intensive treatment of cardiovascular risk factors to prevent myocardial infarction and stroke, which are the main causes of death. Limb surveillance aims to identify restenosis and new disease beyond the intervened segments, both of which may jeopardize patency and lead to recurrent symptoms, functional impairment, or a threatened limb."

The incidence of vascular complications ranges in recent series from 10 to 70% including both early and late complications. The aim of the present study was to determine the incidence of early vascular complications and the effectiveness of the prevention of limb ischemia by the insertion of a catheter for distal perfusion. Data from our registry of 100 patients treated with VA ECMO implanted via percutaneous femoral approach for cardiogenic shock or refractory cardiac arrest were analyzed. If the leg perfusion was inadequate, an additional 7-9 Fr percutaneous catheter distal to the ECMO arterial cannula was placed into the femoral artery to prevent limb ischemia. Thirty-five patients had early vascular complications. Thirty patients with early ischemia were cannulated with a small reperfusion cannula to obtain antegrade perfusion of the limb. Twenty-six had an effective reperfusion. Seven patients developed a compartment syndrome of the leg requiring urgent fasciotomy that led to clinical improvement and recovery in five, while the other two patients progressed to irreversible ischemia requiring amputation of the limb. The majority of ischemic episodes were resolved with the insertion of a distal perfusion catheter. We did not observe any mortal vascular complication, nor any of the observed complications was related to increased mortality."

From the literature, it may be deduced that physiological changes resulted from repeated episodes of brachial-cuff inflation/deflation during RIPC provoke, in some way, systemic \"training\" of the whole organism. At the same time, the effectiveness of such a \"training\" is substantially different in different humans, and the latter remains unclear. We propose the hypothesis as follows: the magnitude of real-time response of cardiovascular system to transient upper limb ischemia serves as a predictive indicator of the organismal sensitivity to RIPC preventive procedure and RIPC clinical efficiency in a particular person. The hypothesized prognosis of the RIPC-induced different resistance to post-ischemic reperfusion injury in different patients is represented in a quantitative manner using dynamic infrared examination of all human limbs simultaneously. With this screening method, it is clearly shown that different cohorts of healthy individuals exhibit different organismal responsiveness to upper limb arterial transient crossclamping.

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) continues to grow in global prevalence and consumes an increasing amount of resources in the United States health care system. Overall rates of intervention for PAD have been rising steadily in recent years. Changing demographics, evolution of technologies, and an expanding database of outcomes studies are primary forces influencing clinical decision making in PAD. The management of PAD is multidisciplinary, involving primary care physicians and vascular specialists with varying expertise in diagnostic and treatment modalities. PAD represents a broad spectrum of disease from asymptomatic through severe limb ischemia. The Society for Vascular Surgery Lower Extremity Practice Guidelines committee reviewed the evidence supporting clinical care in the treatment of asymptomatic PAD and intermittent claudication (IC). The committee made specific practice recommendations using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system. There are limited Level I data available for many of the critical questions in the field, demonstrating the urgent need for comparative effectiveness research in PAD. Emphasis is placed on risk factor modification, medical therapies, and broader use of exercise programs to improve cardiovascular health and functional performance. Screening for PAD appears of unproven benefit at present. Revascularization for IC is an appropriate therapy for selected patients with disabling symptoms, after a careful risk-benefit analysis. Treatment should be individualized based on comorbid conditions, degree of functional impairment, and anatomic factors. Invasive treatments for IC should provide predictable functional improvements with reasonable durability. A minimum threshold of a >50% likelihood of sustained efficacy for at least 2 years is suggested as a benchmark. Anatomic patency (freedom from restenosis) is considered a prerequisite for sustained efficacy of revascularization in IC. Endovascular approaches are favored for most candidates with aortoiliac disease and for selected patients with femoropopliteal disease in whom anatomic durability is expected to meet this minimum threshold. Conversely, caution is warranted in the use of interventions for IC in anatomic settings where durability is limited (extensive calcification, small-caliber arteries, diffuse infrainguinal disease, poor runoff). Surgical bypass may be a preferred strategy in good-risk patients with these disease patterns or in those with prior endovascular failures. Common femoral artery disease should be treated surgically, and saphenous vein is the preferred conduit for infrainguinal bypass grafting. Patients who undergo invasive treatments for IC should be monitored regularly in a surveillance program to record subjective improvements, assess risk factors, optimize compliance with cardioprotective medications, and monitor hemodynamic and patency status."

An emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed to stop intra-abdominal bleeding, while his left limb ischemia was not noticed until 32 h later and femorofemoral bypass was then successfully performed for revascularization. Compartment syndrome was observed postoperatively, and fasciotomy was performed promptly. The wound was temporarily covered with Vaccum Sealing Drainage due to high skin tension.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand fundamental mechanisms regulating vascular repair in specific cell types to develop new beneficial therapeutic interventions. In this review, we highlight recent studies demonstrating that epigenetic mechanisms (including post-translational modifications of DNA and histones as well as non-coding RNA-mediated processes) play essential roles in the regulation of endothelial stem/progenitor cell functions through modifying chromatin structure. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of using small molecules that modulate the activities of epigenetic enzymes to enhance the vascular repair function of endothelial cells and offer insight on potential strategies that may accelerate clinical applications."

Whether patients with lower extremity ischemia admitted over the weekend have inferior outcomes compared with those admitted on a weekday is unknown. Nonelective admissions for critical limb ischemia (CLI) and acute limb ischemia (ALI) from lower extremity thrombosis or embolism were identified in the 2005 to 2010 Nationwide Inpatient Sample, and outcomes were compared based on weekend vs weekday admission by using multiple logistic and linear regression. Of the 63,768 patients identified with lower extremity vascular emergencies, 15.4% were admitted during the weekend. Patients admitted on the weekend were less likely to have CLI than those admitted on a weekday (51.2% vs 65.4%; P < .001) and were more likely to have ALI than patients admitted during a weekday (48.8% vs 34.5%; P < .001). Weekend admission was independently associated with a lower likelihood of revascularization (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.95; P < .001), a longer time until revascularization (3.09 days vs 2.75 days; P < .001), an increased likelihood of major amputation (aOR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.19-1.53; P < .001), in-hospital complications (aOR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.11-1.25; P < .001), and discharge to a skilled nursing facility (aOR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06-1.25; P = .001), and a longer predicted length of stay (10.1 days vs 9.5 days; P < .001). There was no statistically significant association between weekend admission and in-hospital mortality (aOR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06-1.25; P = .10). Patients admitted on the weekend for lower extremity vascular emergencies are significantly more likely to experience adverse outcomes, including major amputation, than patients admitted on a weekday, independent of their presenting diagnosis with ALI or CLI. Further investigation into the etiologies of these differences is needed to address this disparity. These data raise questions about the proper staffing models to optimize urgent treatment of lower extremity vascular emergencies."

Delay in treatment increases the risk of major amputation and may be present at different stages, including patient delay, doctors´ delay and waiting time in the emergency department. It is important to identify existing problems in order to reduce time delay. The aim of this study was to collect data for patients with acute limb ischemia and to evaluate the time delay between the different events from onset of symptoms to specialist evaluation and further treatment with focus on pre-hospital and in-hospital time delays. We conducted a prospective cross-sectional cohort study including all patients suspected with acute limb ischemia who were admitted to the emergency department of a community hospital in a six months period. Temporal delay in the different phases between the time of occurrence of symptoms and completion of treatment was recorded prospectively. All patients who underwent intervention had a 30 days follow-up with regard to major amputation of the leg and survival. A total of 42 patients (21 men and 21 women) age 73 (20-95) years (median (range)) was identified. From onset of symptoms to first contact with a doctor the time for all patients were 24 (0-1200) hours. Thirty patients needed immediate intervention. In the group of fourteen patients who had immediate operation, the median time from vascular evaluation to revascularization was 324.5 (122-873) minutes and in the group of eight patients that went through an imaging procedure before an operation the median delay was 822 (494-1185) minutes from specialist assessment to revascularization. The median time for revascularization among four patients, who were treated with arterial thrombolysis was 5621 (1686-8376) minutes. At 30 days follow up, six patients had had the ischemic limb amputated above the ankle and four patients had died. We found that the largest time delay was between onset of symptoms and first contact to a medical doctor. A greater public awareness is needed, so as to facilitate urgent revascularisation and improve outcomes."

In all cases the urgent endovascular revascularization was considered the first therapeutic option. Twenty-seven patients (26%) were excluded from this approach (long occlusion >30 cm of the femoro-popliteal tract and/or massive gangrene with abscess/osteomyelitis/necrotizing fasciitis). Seventy-seven out of 104 patients received an urgent endovascular treatment. They were predominantly male (43, 55.8%) with a mean age of 76.5 years (range 47-94). In 67 cases (87%) the patients had leg/foot lesions (54, 70.1%, Rutherford class 5, and 13, 16.9%, Rutherford class 6). During the follow-up (mean duration 6.2 months, range 1-24 months) the healing of the lesions and the relief of rest pain were obtained in 46 cases (59.7%).

    "abstract": "The promise of cell therapy for repair and restoration of damaged tissues or organs relies on administration of large dose of cells whose healing benefits are still limited and sometimes irreproducible due to uncontrollable cell loss and death at lesion sites. Using a large amount of therapeutic cells increases the costs for cell processing and the risks of side effects. Optimal cell delivery strategies are therefore in urgent need to enhance the specificity, efficacy, and reproducibility of cell therapy leading to minimized cell dosage and side effects. Here, we addressed this unmet need by developing injectable 3D microscale cellular niches (microniches) based on biodegradable gelatin microcryogels (GMs). The microniches are constituted by in vitro priming human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) seeded within GMs resulting in tissue-like ensembles with enriched extracellular matrices and enhanced cell-cell interactions. The primed 3D microniches facilitated cell protection from mechanical insults during injection and in vivo cell retention, survival, and ultimate therapeutic functions in treatment of critical limb ischemia (CLI) in mouse models compared with free cell-based therapy. In particular, 3D microniche-based therapy with 10(5) hMSCs realized better ischemic limb salvage than treatment with 10(6) free-injected hMSCs, the minimum dosage with therapeutic effects for treating CLI in literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first convincing demonstration of injectable and primed cell delivery strategy realizing superior therapeutic efficacy for treating CLI with the lowest cell dosage in mouse models. This study offers a widely applicable cell delivery platform technology to boost the healing power of cell regenerative therapy."

Visceral, renal, and limb ischemia occur in up to 30% of patients with ABAD and are associated with higher in-hospital mortality. The aim of the open fenestration is to resolve the malperfusion by creating a single aortic lumen at the suprarenal or infrarenal level. This surgical procedure is less invasive than total aortic replacement, thus not requiring extracorporeal support and allowing preservation of the intercostal arteries, which results in decreased risk of paraplegia. Surgical aortic fenestration represents an effective and durable option for treating ischemic complications of ABAD, particularly for patients with no aortic dilatation. In the current endovascular era, this open technique serves as an alternative option in case of contraindications or failure of endovascular management of complicated ABAD."

If we consider that according to all epidemiological studies, the number of diabetic people is expected to double by 2030, the worse complication of this disease could represent a big sanitary, social, and economic problem in the near future. In developed countries, the cost of treatment for diabetic disease-related foot problems represents 15 - 25 % of available resources for the treatment of diabetes in general, but in some developing countries, the same cost may reach up to 40 % of available resources for diabetic disease. On the positive side, currently over 90 % of all diabetes-related amputations may be prevented thanks to the education of diabetic patients as primary prevention, and mainly to the new non-surgical revascularization techniques, which effectively fight the consequences of diabetic arteriopathy as a secondary prevention. The virtual pathway in reducing lower limb amputations starts with a better comprehension of critical limb ischemia (CLI), particularly its diagnostic aspects and consequent revascularization treatment. For 15 years we have assisted in a spectacular improvement of revascularization modalities and particularly of endovascular interventions. As a consequence, a large series of treated patients have shown the possibility to reduce the risk of limb loss in subjects at a higher risk to a rate of 1.7 - 2.4 %. Management of CLI requires integrating clinical, interventional, and surgical competencies together to a significant cultural advancement of every single physician involved in reducing the risk of limb loss. Consensus documents and international guidelines are, in general, precious opportunities to promote cultural and scientific upgrading of the involved specialist, but their results sometimes do not meet the physician's expectations.

There were no major complications or emergency amputations. Mean patient follow-up was 64 weeks, and two patients were lost to follow-up. Primary patency rates at 3, 6, and 12 months were 87%, 48%, and 16%, respectively. Successful secondary procedures were performed in seven patients, with secondary patency rates at 3, 6, and 12 months of 88%, 73%, and 44%, respectively. Limb salvage rates at 12 and 24 months were 94% and 65%, and amputation-free survival rates at 12 and 24 months were 87% and 60%, respectively. Endovascular recanalization of native CTOs in patients with failed lower-extremity bypass grafts is technically feasible and safe and results in acceptable limb salvage."

    "abstract": "A 66-year-old man was referred for treatment of critical limb ischemia arising with multiple organ dysfunction due to acute pneumonia. Angiographic examinations demonstrated total obstruction of the bilateral external iliac arteries and the bilateral superficial femoral arteries with collateral circulation to the distal vessels. Urgent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty dissolved the obstruction of the left external iliac artery, and subsequent low-density-lipoprotein apheresis ameliorated his progressive ischemia in the lower extremities. Femoro-femoral and bilateral femoro-popliteal bypasses were performed 31 days after the endovascular intervention, which achieved successful limb salvage with the relief of ischemic symptoms related to arteriosclerotic obliterans."

    "title": "Hybrid revascularization of complex multilevel disease: a paradigm shift in critical limb ischemia treatment.",
    "abstract": "Critical limb ischemia frequently occurs on a background of extensive co-morbidities and carries a poor prognosis which requires urgent management. Disease severity and patient comorbidity influence the initial choice of management which according to traditional paradigms, is a choice between open or endovascular repair. Over the last decade hybrid intervention, which is the planned combined use of both open and endovascular techniques, has increasingly been used to tackle multilevel disease. In this review we look at the techniques and results of hybrid surgery. This technique is ideal for multilevel lesions, as it is minimally invasive, allows prompt limb revascularization as opposed to the delays inherent in staged procedures and it appears to be more convenient to patients. It also leads to reduced length of hospital stay and reduces overall cost. Most importantly it offers an alternative to open revascularization in medically high risk patients. The success and popularity of hybrid interventions has been underpinned by advances in stent and balloon technology and the advent of the hybrid operating theatre which has allowed multiple techniques to be used simultaneously. Iliac angioplasty and stenting is now the first line of treatment for TASC C/D iliac lesions with good technical success and long-term patency. In patients who also have common femoral disease, endarterectomy can be combined with iliac stenting and this has now almost replaced open bypass. Most series for a variety of hybrid procedures report good limb salvage rates, with morbidity and mortality data considered equal to or better than open bypass procedures. Careful patient selection and detailed preoperative planning are essential to achieve these excellent results. Studies have reported on prospective series or retrospective analysis for various hybrid techniques, including non randomized trials comparing hybrid and open surgical treatment. Ideally, a randomized controlled trial comparing open and hybrid treatment is needed to minimize confounding variables."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes after endovascular repair (ER) and contemporary open repair (OR) of popliteal artery aneurysms (PAAs). Clinical data of PAA patients treated between 2005 and 2012 were reviewed. Primary end points were major adverse events (MAEs) including mortality, major amputation, patency, complications, and reinterventions. A total of 149 PAAs were treated in 120 patients (mean age, 74 ± 10 years). ER was performed in 42 limbs of 35 men (mean age, 81 ± 6.5 years), in 32 electively and in 10 emergently. Technical success was 98%. The 30-day MAEs were more frequent after emergent repair (50% vs 9%; odds ratio [OR], 9.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.74-54; P = .01); mortality and amputation rate was 0% after elective repair, 20% after emergent repair. Mean follow-up was 2.6 years (1 month-6.5 years); 3-year freedom from MAEs was lower after emergent repair than after elective repair (40% vs 66%; hazard ratio [HR], 3.13; 95% CI, 1.10-8.85; P = .03). OR was performed in 107 limbs of 91 patients (90 men; mean age, 71 ± 9.6 years), in 93 electively and in 14 emergently. The 30-day MAEs were more frequent after emergent repair (43% vs 5%; OR, 13; 95% CI, 3.29-53; P < .001); mortality was 1% after elective repair, 0% after emergent cases. Amputation rate was 0% for both elective and emergent repairs. Mean follow-up was 3.8 years (1 month-8.4 years); 3-year freedom from MAEs was lower after emergent repair (50% vs 80%; HR, 3.78; 95% CI, 1.55-9.20; P = .003). The 30-day MAE rates were equivalent between ER and OR independent of urgency of repair (elective: OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 0.41-8.09; P = .43; emergent: OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.26-6.81; P = .73). In elective interventions, ER had a trend to decreased freedom from MAEs (66% vs 80% at 3 years; HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 0.92-4.07; P = .08); freedom from reintervention was lower after ER (72% vs 88%; HR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.02-5.70; P = .046). In emergent interventions, 1-year freedom from MAEs was similar (40% vs 50%; HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.49-3.74; P = .55). Emergent ER and poor runoff predicted MAEs. Our study failed to prove the superiority of ER over OR. If anatomy is suitable, ER of PAA in the elderly and high-risk patients is justified. For emergent PAA repairs, MAEs are frequent after both ER and OR; ER has not changed the severe prognosis of acute limb ischemia from PAA. A multicenter randomized controlled trial of PAA patients with acute presentation is warranted."

    "abstract": "This population-based study aims to elucidate the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HCAI) and related risk factors in non-emergent, open and endovascular lower extremity vascular procedures. This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from the Swedish National Vascular Surgery registry (Swedvasc), National Patient registry, and Cause of Death registry. A nationwide survey of all postoperative infections among patients who have undergone non-emergent open and endovascular surgery for lower extremity arterial disease between January 2005 to December 2010 (n = 10,547) has been performed. Data were retrieved from the National Vascular Surgery registry and cross-matched with the National Patient and Cause of Death registries. The primary purpose of the study was to identify the rate of 30-day postoperative infections and the associated risk factors for the different classes of lower extremity ischemia and operative procedures. The study cohort included patients with claudication 27.0% (n = 2,827) and critical limb ischemia (CLI), consisting of rest pain 17.0% (n = 1,835) and ulceration/gangrene 56.0% (n = 5,885) undergoing endovascular intervention (n = 6,262; 59.0%), thromboendarterectomy (n = 1,061; 10.0%), or bypass surgery (n = 3,224; 31.0%). The total incidence of postoperative infection (<30-days) was 9.7% (n = 1,019), including skin and soft tissue infection (n = 735; 6.9%), urinary tract infection (n = 168; 1.6%), pneumonia (n = 114; 1.1%), and sepsis (n = 91; 0.9%). In claudicants, the risk of infection was increased eightfold for bypass surgery compared with endovascular intervention (odds ratio 8.4, 95% confidence interval 5.0-14). Risk factors associated with infection were degree of lower extremity ischemia, diabetes, renal insufficiency, and heart and lung disease (p < .05). The postoperative rate of HCAI is associated with cardiovascular risk factors, operative method, and degree of lower extremity ischemia. This may be of assistance when deciding on the type of operative procedure for these patients."

We report the case of a young female patient presenting to the ED with a painful white left leg. Clinical examination revealed acute lower-limb ischemia, abdominal distention, and shock. Diagnostic work-up, including an abdominal computed tomography scan, showed compression of the aorta, inferior vena cava, and both iliac arteries, as well as hypoperfusion of the right kidney and left liver lobe, all due to compression by a massive gastric dilatation. Gastroscopy revealed a massively dilated stomach containing > 6 L of fluid and gastric wall ischemia. After decompression, the circulation to the lower limbs recovered immediately. The day after admission the patient developed an acute abdomen leading to a semi-urgent laparoscopy during which a sleeve gastrectomy was performed for the treatment of partial gastric necrosis. Clinical evolution afterward was favorable and the patient recovered completely. This case report underscores the importance of a thorough clinical examination in every patient admitted to the ED. Early diagnosis and treatment are mandatory in preventing fatal complications."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia is a complication of severe peripheral arterial disease that can be a threatening limb as well as life. Multiple procedures exist today to help revascularize extremities; however, even with the latest technologies, surgical amputation of the limb may still be necessary. Cryoamputation, or physiologic amputation, is a method used to treat patients who are hemodynamically unstable for the operating room and who are in need of urgent amputation owing to arterial ischemia. This procedure is used in the rare instance where not only a persons' limb is threatened, but also their life. This is a case study regarding one patient who presented to the hospital with limb-threatening ischemia who became hemodynamically unstable owing to the rhabdomyolysis associated with the ischemia of his lower extremity. Cryoamputation was used to stabilize the patient and prevent further deterioration, so that he could safely undergo surgical amputation of the limb without an increase in mortality risk. Cryoamputation must be followed by formal surgical amputation when the patient is hemodynamically stabilized. It is not a limb salvaging, procedure but it is a life-saving procedure. This case study demonstrates the usefulness of the procedure and discusses the technique used for cryoamputation."

Our aim was to evaluate the immediate and midterm clinical results on 28 patients with acute lower limb ischemia treated with hybrid reconstructions on emergent basis, from January 2010 to March 2013 in our tertiary referral vascular center. A total of 28 patients (31 operated limbs) underwent emergent hybrid revascularization, with endovascular treatment performed proximally or distally to the site of open reconstruction. The median follow-up period was 6 months (range: 1-26). The immediate technical success was clinically and hemodynamically evaluated with an ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) measurement. Six-month overall patency, limb salvage, and survival rate were also estimated. All analyses were performed with Kaplan-Meier life table method, using the STATISTICA 7.0 statistical program. Twenty-seven patients presented with grade IIb and 1 with grade III ischemia, respectively. Technical success was achieved in all patients, whereas hemodynamic improvement rate was achieved in 98%. ABPI preoperatively was increased from 0.14 ± 0.1 to 0.69 ± 0.28 postoperatively (P < 0.05). Perioperative morbidity and mortality rates were 21% and 11% respectively. Six-month overall patency, limb salvage, and survival rate were 86%, 92%, and 79%, respectively. Hybrid revascularization in immediately threatened limbs provides an effective and durable option with acceptable mortality and amputation rate in these high-risk patients. These findings should be further confirmed by larger scale clinical studies."

Unfortunately, residual thrombus, propagation of thrombi, chronic atherosclerotic disease, and vessel injuries secondary to balloon catheter passage may limit the clinical success rate. Intraoperative angiography can identify any arterial imperfection after TE, which may be corrected simultaneously by endovascular techniques (so-called \"hybrid procedures,\" HP). The aim of this study is to compare outcomes of surgical TE vs HP in patients with acute lower limb ischemia (ALLI). From 2006 to 2012, 322 patients with ALLI were admitted to our department. Patients received urgent surgical treatment using only a Fogarty balloon catheter (TE group = 112) or in conjunction with endovascular completion (HP group = 210). In-hospital complications, 30-day mortality, primary and secondary patency, reintervention rate, limb salvage, and overall survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by log-rank test. HPs (n = 210) following surgical TE consisted of angioplasty (PTA) ± stenting in 90 cases, catheter-directed intra-arterial thrombolysis + PTA ± stenting in 24, thrombus fragmentation and aspiration by large guiding catheter + PTA ± stenting in 67, vacuum-based accelerated thromboaspiration by mechanical devices in 9, and primary covered stenting in 12. Estimated primary patency was 90.4% vs 70.4% at 2-year and 87.1% vs 66.3% at 5-year follow-up, respectively, for HP and TE patients (hazard ratio, 3.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.78-5.41; P < .01). A hazard ratio of 2.1 for limb salvage was noted for the HP group (95% confidence interval, 1.01-4.34; P = .03). Estimated freedom from reintervention at 1 year was 94.4% for HP vs 82.1% for TE patients, and 89% vs 73.7% at 5 years, respectively (P = .04). HPs for ALLI may represent the tools that, when applied to specific clinical scenarios, hold the potential to reduce the morbidity previously associated with acute arterial occlusion."

Between June 2011 and June 2013, we prospectively enrolled all patients with acute type B dissection (<14 days) complicated by visceral malperfusion and treated by the Zenith Dissection Endovascular System, including a proximal covered stent and a distal noncovered stent. Organ malperfusion was diagnosed during the clinical, biological, and morphologic follow-up of patients admitted to a dedicated intensive care unit (SOS Aorta). End points were 30-day mortality and morbidity, and reoperation rate, survival, and remodelling of the dissected aorta during follow-up. Fifteen patients (11 men; mean age, 60 ± 12 years) were treated in emergency procedures with a median delay of 36 hours. Malperfusions included renal ischemia in all patients, intestinal ischemia in nine, and lower limb ischemia in six. The proximal entry tear in each patient was covered by a stent Zenith TX2 graft (mean diameter, 36 mm; mean length, 170 mm; Cook Medical), supplemented by a noncovered aortic stent (diameter, 36 or 46 mm; length, 164 mm) with a technical success rate of 100%. The left subclavian artery in 10 patients was covered without revascularization. One chimney was necessary to revascularize the left common carotid artery. Six patients required complementary arterial branch stenting for persistent static malperfusion, using eight peripheral stents (five iliacs, three renals). No deaths were recorded during the 30-day postoperative period. Major adverse events were reported in three patients (20%): 1 paraparesis with complete recovery, 1 colonic resection, 1 stroke, and 2 transient renal failures. The mean hospital stay was 14 ± 6 days. During a mean follow-up of 8 ± 3 months, one sudden death, no aortic-related complications, and no reoperations or conversions were recorded. Remodelling with healing of the thoracic false lumen was obtained in 10 patients (67%), and five others had a partially thrombosed false lumen without remodelling. Used as a treatment for organ malperfusion complicating acute type B dissections, the Zenith Dissection Endovascular System achieved safely and effectively satisfactory clinical results in the short term. The long-term effect of this composite treatment on aortic remodelling remains to be determined."

In the diagnosis of limb pain of arterial origin it is essential to distinguish rest pain from intermittent claudication. Rest pain is associated with high risk of amputation and is therefore an indication for examinations within specialized care. First-line treatment of intermittent claudication instead consists of the management of risk factors and guided exercise. Specialized care consultation is required only in case of intermittent claudication which is refractory to conservative treatment and threatening the ability to work and function.

A PubMed database search was performed looking for studies reporting endovascular treatment of PAA with the Hemobahn/Viabahn endograft within the period January 2000-December 2012. All relevant studies were independently assessed and all references were examined for potentially missed relevant reports. Studies were included if they reported experience with five patients or more. Eight studies with 222 patients (mean age 72.4 years, 92.3% male) and 251 PAA (mean diameter 2.9 mm, 14.3% symptomatic) were included. Thirteen cases (5.2%) were treated on an urgent basis, including three cases of ruptured PAA and 10 cases of acute limb ischemia. Initial technical success was 99.2%. The mean number of implanted endografts/PAA was 1.8 (range 1-4). Thirty-day mortality was 1 (0.4%) patient. Perioperative complications occurred in 1.6%, consisting of three access site hematomas and one acute endograft thrombosis. Cumulative mean follow-up duration was 36.9 months. During this period, a total of 46 endograft failures (42 occlusions, 4 stenoses) were observed within a mean postoperative time interval of 10.8 months. Cumulative primary and secondary patency rates were 85.6% and 93.4% at one year, and 78.5% and 90.4% at 2 years, respectively. Limb salvage rate during follow-up was 99.2%. Endoleak was noticed in 15 (6%) cases and endograft migration in 13 (5.2%) cases. Endograft fracture was reported in 14 (5.6%) cases, resulting in occlusion in six patients, and in type III and IV endoleaks in two patients. Secondary intervention during follow-up was required in 47 (18.7%) cases, including 32 reinterventions for endograft occlusion, four for endograft stenosis, and 11 for endoleak repair. Endovascular PAA repair with the Hemobahn/Viabahn endograft is feasible and safe yielding excellent initial technical success rates, minimum perioperative mortality and morbidity, and mid-term patency and limb salvage rates comparable to open surgery. These results suggest that a significant proportion of patients might benefit from endovascular PAA repair."

Technical success was obtained in 16 cases (88.9%). At disharge mortality was 5.9% (1 case), and amputation rate was 6.2% (1 pt). The Kaplan-Meier curves at 1 year revealed an estimated freedom from death, amputation and re-occlusion of 76.5%, 88.2%, and 71.3%, respectively. The over 90 years old patient represent a challenging case for vascular surgeon. Vascular procedures involve high mortality rate but emergent revascularization by Fogarty Embolectomy in ALI is safe and effective even in older patient."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia is both a limb-threatening and life-threatening disease process. Nontraumatic acute peripheral arterial occlusion is most commonly caused by a thrombosis or an embolism. There is limited evidence on the use of bedside ultrasound for the detection of acute limb ischemia, but duplex ultrasonography is standard in the diagnosis and operative planning in chronic limb ischemia. Emergency physicians may use bedside ultrasound in the evaluation of patients with symptoms and signs suggestive of this disease entity. A 64-year-old man with a past medical history of hypertension and an ischemic stroke presented to the Emergency Department with <2 h of severe upper left leg pain that radiated down to his foot. A bedside ultrasound of the left lower extremity was emergently performed. On B-mode ultrasound evaluation, echogenic material was visualized in the left common femoral artery, the artery was noncompressible, and there was an absence of Doppler flow signal. He was then directly taken to the operating room for an emergent limb-saving procedure. A focused examination of the aorta, iliac vessels, and femoral artery bifurcation with bedside ultrasonography may help to localize peripheral arterial occlusions and can assist the emergency physician in seeking timely surgical consultation and management."

    "abstract": "The aim of this paper was to analyze the durability and efficacy of emergency thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for acute Stanford type B aortic dissection (TBAD) with malperfusion syndrome. A retrospective analysis of acute TBAD with spinal cord, kidney, viscera, and extremity malperfusion was performed. Emergency TEVAR to cover primary tear site by stent-graft was strongly suggested to included candidates. Computed tomography (CT) scans and clinical findings were carried out in diagnosis and follow-up. One hundred twenty-seven TBAD patients (101 men, 46.1±11.4 year, range 34~76) who presented with acute end-organ malperfusion, including sudden paraplegia (N.=4), acute renal failure (N.=26), acute viscera ischemia (N.=61) and limb ischemia (N.=36), received aortic stent-grafting 2~48 hours after onset. Technical success was achieved in all primary TEVAR. The overall endoleak rate was 7.1% (9/127; typeI:3; typeII: 4; typeIV: 2). The 30-day mortality was 0.8% (2/127). 125 patients were followed for 19.1±14.5 (1~86) months, one patient died 50 days post-TEVAR due to myocardial infarction. Four patients required reintervention with additional stent grafts. Follow-up CT angiography showed enlargement of the true lumen and different degrees of thrombosis in the distal false lumen (complete thrombosis in 48, partial thrombosis in 52 and patency in 24). Emergency TEVAR is an effective method to treat acute TBAD complicated with end-organ malperfusion. Covering of the proximal entry site of TBAD by stent-graft leads to flow increased in the true lumen and thrombosis of the false lumen of varying degree, which may improve end-organ perfusion and restore branch vessels patency."

    "abstract": "The most severe complication of ischemia-reperfusion injury following lower limb arterial surgery is reperfusion syndrome. Therefore, our aim was to describe the extent of muscle damage and the reperfusion syndrome-related remote organ lesions in detail, through a well-documented case of long-lasting infrarenal aorta thrombosis. After urgent revascularization, several clinical signs of multiple organ dysfunction were detectable, including the circulatory, urinary, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and hemostatic systems. Upon histological examination, intraoperative muscle biopsy showed severe muscle damage. Muscle fiber viability was assessed with a special nitroblue tetrazolium staining-based viability test developed by our team; the obtained results indicated significant degree of muscle damage before this was confirmed by conventional histological methods. Thorough postmortem examination confirmed the presence of remote organ damage. The pathological findings included acute tubular necrosis, myocardial and jejunal infarctions, ischemic pancreatitis, and diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation in the lungs and focal centrilobular liver necrosis. By using special staining techniques, the presence of myoglobin and lipofuscin deposits was confirmed in the kidney samples. In this paper, we present a patient who developed all major complications following long-lasting arterial occlusion. We also introduce a novel method to assess the degree of ischemic injury, which may be suitable in the near future for the rapid detection of irreversible muscle injury. Therefore, the mortality of the disease might be reduced."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia (ALI) represents an emergency in which delayed intervention results in significant morbidity, and potentially, death. To assess the role of duplex in differentiating embolic from thrombotic ALI. We prospectively recruited 57 patients; with 62 non-traumatic ALI. We measured the diameter at the occluded site (dO) and the corresponding contralateral healthy side (dC). The absolute (∆) and percent change (∆%) between the two diameters were calculated as: (dO-dC) and [(∆/dC)×100] respectively. According to the reference standard (contrast angiography or surgery), limbs were classified into embolic (E-group:37 limbs) and thrombotic (T-group:25 limbs) groups. Postoperative duplex was done in 34 patients after embolectomy and the absolute (∆P) and percent change (∆P%) between the postoperative (dP) and preoperative (dO) diameters at the occlusion were calculated as: (dP-dO) and [(∆P/dO)×100] respectively. The baseline clinical characteristics were similar between both groups. However, in the E-group, (∆%) was 21.96±17.53% vs. -11.03±16.16% in the T-group, (p<0.001). A cutoff value of >1.41% for (∆%) had 100% sensitivity and 76% specificity for the diagnosis of embolic vs. thrombotic occlusion with AUC 0.95 (95% CI: 0.901-0.999, p<0.00l). Postoperatively (∆P%) was -11.8±8.2% with a significant negative correlation found between (∆) and (∆P); Spearman's coefficient (rho)=-0.912, P<0.001. A cut off value of 1.41% as percent dilatation or diminution in the diameter of occluded artery is the most important duplex sign for predicting embolic or thrombotic ALI respectively. Postoperative reduction in the diameter of occluded artery after embolectomy confirms this sign."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (AAAD) is a cardiovascular emergency with a high potential for death. Rapid surgical treatment is indicated to prevent fatal complications. Aggressive appropriate medical management starts at first suspicion and is essential to prevent exacerbation or rupture of the dissection. Despite improved surgical techniques, perioperative care and the development of specialized cardiovascular centers, mortality remains high. Organ ischemia is a catastrophic manifestation of aortic dissection, demanding acute surgical intervention in specialized cardiovascular centers. We present the case of a 62-year-old man with isolated acute limb ischemia due to an acute type A aortic dissection treated in a regional general hospital, without a specialized cardiovascular service, with immediate open malperfusion repair and aggressive medical management. The patient did not undergo further surgical aortic repair, and after a 30-month follow-up he remains symptom free and in good clinical condition, suggesting that although aortic surgery remains the gold standard for treatment of acute Type A dissection, appropriate medical management and early malperfusion repair may offer an initial limb- or life-saving procedure. This staged approach gives clinicians more time to properly evaluate and transfer the patient to a specialized cardiovascular center, and in some cases may even offer a definite treatment."

A 52-year-old male patient with multiple atherogenic risk factors was admitted for non-healing pedal ulcer and absent distal pulses. Based on the clinical presentation, Doppler ultrasound and angiography findings, the patient underwent elective in situ bypass arterial reconstruction. The saphenous vein graft was of satisfactory quality and the procedure went routinely. Acute graft thrombosis on postoperative day 0 was recognized immediately and prompted an emergent surgical revision. No technical errors or anatomical/mechanical causes for failed reconstruction were found and the graft was successfully thrombectomized using a Fogarty balloon-catheter. Graft rethrombosis, however, ensued after several hours. Considering the absence of threatening limb ischemia and the idiopathic recurrent thrombosis, raising suspicion of prothrombotic state, conservative treatment was pursued. Postoperative thrombophilia testing proved positive for activated protein C resistance, mandating introduction of chronic oral anticoagulation. Six months later, the operated extremity is viable. Inexplicable vascular graft thrombosis, particularly if early and recurrent, should raise suspicion of underlying thrombophilia. If confirmed by laboratory testing, long-term secondary antithrombotic prophylaxis may be required."

A single-center series of 3000 kidney transplants and 126 pancreas transplants between 1974 and 2010 was studied retrospectively. Ten patients had anastomotic arterial aneurysms: eight after kidney transplantation and two after pancreas-kidney transplantation. Diagnosis was based on the association Doppler ultrasonography-angioscanner. Ten arterial anastomotic aneurysms were identified. The circumstances of discovery were clinical in eight cases, half of them by hemodynamic collapsus. A majority of our patients (60%) were diagnosed in the year following the transplantation and two cases were discovered after transplantectomy. Pancreas-kidney transplantation had a high risk for arterial anastomotic aneurysm. Candida albicans was isolated in preoperative samples in four cases. The management consisted to transplantectomy in seven patients, revascularization of the lower limb in six patients and one renal transplant preservation. We found two lower limb ischemia and two deaths by a fatal intraoperative haemorrhage and vascular cerebral haemorrhage. No recurrence was identified after in the follow-up ranged from 20 months to 12 years. Arterial anastomotic aneurysm was in our study a serious complication that requires emergency surgery. The transplantectomy followed by revascularization of the limb is the treatment of choice associated to an appropriate antifungal or antibiotic treatment."

    "abstract": "Specific perioperative risk assessment models have been developed for bariatric, pancreatic, and colorectal surgery. A similar instrument, specific for patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI), could improve patient-centered clinical decision making. We describe a novel tool to predict 30-day major morbidity and mortality (M&M) after bypass surgery for CLI. Data for 4985 individuals from the 2007 to 2009 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program were used to develop and internally validate the model. Outcome measures included mortality, major morbidity, and a composite end point (M&M). M&M included mortality and the most severe postoperative morbidities that were highly associated with death (eg, sepsis and major cardiopulmonary complications). More than 30 preoperative factors were tested for association with 30-day mortality, major morbidity, and M&M. Significant predictors in multivariate models were assigned integer values (points), which were added to calculate a patient's Comprehensive Risk Assessment For Bypass (CRAB) score. Performance was assessed (C-index) across all outcome measures and compared with other general tools (American Society of Anesthesiologists class, Surgical Risk Scale) and existing CLI-specific survival prediction models (Finnvasc score, Edifoligide for the Prevention of Infrainguinal Vein Graft Failure [PREVENT III] score) on a distinct validation sample (n = 1620). In the derivation data set (n = 3275), the 30-day mortality rate was 2.9%. The rate of any major morbidity was 19.1%. The composite end point M&M occurred in 10.1%. Significant predictors of M&M by multivariate analysis included age >75 years, prior amputation or revascularization, tissue loss, dialysis dependence, severe cardiac disease, emergency operation, and functional dependence. Applied to a distinct validation sample of 1620 patients, higher CRAB scores were significantly associated with higher rates of mortality, all major morbidities, and M&M (P < .0001). Comparison with other models by assessment of area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve revealed the CRAB was a more accurate predictor of mortality, all major morbidity, and M&M. The CRAB is a CLI-specific, risk assessment instrument derived from multi-institutional American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program surgical outcomes data that out-performs existing prognostic risk indices in the prediction of clinically significant adverse events after bypass surgery. Use of the CRAB as a risk assessment tool provides an evidence basis for patient-centered clinical decision making and may have a role in identifying patients at higher risk for surgical revascularization in whom an endovascular approach is preferable."

We assessed our hypothesis that urgent proximal aortic repair resolves most cases of limb ischemia without additional peripheral revascularization. We retrospectively reviewed operative cases of acute type A aortic dissection from 1999 to 2011. Our standard technique involved urgent replacement of the ascending aorta and hemiarch. Persistent limb ischemia after aortic repair was treated by bypass surgery. Comparisons between groups both with and without limb ischemia were made. We repaired 335 cases during the study period. Sixty-one patients had limb ischemia (18.2%), of whom 51 were classified with lower limb ischemia (15.2%). All patients with upper limb ischemia survived to discharge without limb loss or death. Only 11 of the 51 patients with lower limb ischemia (21.6%) required peripheral revascularization after aortic repair. There was one case of lower limb loss resulting from delayed recognition of persistent ischemia. Renal dysfunction occurred in 21% of patients with isolated lower limb ischemia and in 31% of patients with uncomplicated dissection (P = .29). In-hospital mortality was 13.7% overall and 8.0% in patients with isolated lower limb ischemia (P = .89). There was no difference in long-term survival between isolated limb ischemia and uncomplicated cases (P = .54). Most cases of limb ischemia resolve after immediate repair of acute type A aortic dissection. There is no difference in renal dysfunction or in-hospital or long-term mortality between patients with isolated limb ischemia and those with nonmalperfusion dissection. If ischemia persists, limb salvage is successful if revascularization is expeditious."

Most of the causes of acute limb ischemia are thrombosis of a limb artery or bypass graft, embolism from the heart or a disease artery, dissection, and trauma.

Prompt diagnosis and revascularization by means of catheter-based thrombolysis or thrombectomy and by surgery reduce the risk of limb loss and mortality. Amputation is performed in patients with irreversible damage.

The high morbidities and mortalities in current pediatric ECMO practice are noted in China. Therefore, it is necessary to review the experience on rescue use of ECMO in critically ill pediatric patients. A retrospective analysis was done for patients who had been receiving ECMO treatment to rescue refractory cardiorespiratory failure from different causes in a hospital between July 2007 and May 2011. A total of 12 patients were treated with ECMO; 7 of them were male and 5 female, they aged 6 days to 11 years, weighed 2.8 - 35 (17.21 ± 11.64) kg. The underlying causes of cardiorespiratory failure were as follows: two cases with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leading to respiratory failure, 4 with failure of weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, 3 with fulminant myocarditis, 1 with right ventricular cardiomyopathy leading to repeated cardiac arrest, 1 with preoperative severe hypoxemia, and 1 with anaphylactic shock complicated with massive pulmonary hemorrhage and severe hypoxemia. Of the 12 cases, 3 were established ECMO (E-CPR) while underwent chest compression cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The mean ECMO support time was 151.75 (15 - 572) h. Seven patients (58.33%) were weaned from ECMO, 6 patients (50.00%) were successfully discharged. Six cases had bleeding from sutures, 2 cases with severe bleeding underwent thoracotomy hemostasis, 2 presented with acute renal failure. Infection was documented in 3 cases, hyperbilirubinemia in 2 cases, lower limb ischemia in 1 case, hyperglycemia in 3 cases, disseminated intravascular coagulation in 1 case, membrane lung leakage in 2 cases, systemic hemolysis in 3 cases, oxygenator failure in 2 cases and oxygenator thrombosis in one case. During the follow-up between 6 months and 4.5 years, 5 patients survived with good quality of life, without any documented central nervous system disorders. One case survived with the right lower extremity disorder from ischemic damage. His motor function has been improved following orthopedic operation at one year after discharge.

We used alternate approaches of intra-aortic balloon pump insertion to provide temporary and minimally invasive support for patients with decompensating, end-stage heart failure. The present study describes the outcomes with closed-chest, transthoracic intra-aortic balloon pumps by way of the subclavian artery. During a 3-year period, 20 patients underwent subclavian artery-intra-aortic balloon pump in the setting of end-stage heart failure. The balloon was inserted through a polytetrafluoroethylene graft sutured to the right subclavian artery in 19 patients (95%) and to the left subclavian artery in 1 patient (5%). The goal of support was to bridge to transplantation in 17 patients (85%) and bridge to recovery in 3 patients (15%). The primary outcome measure was death during subclavian artery-intra-aortic balloon pump support. The secondary outcomes included survival to the intended endpoint of bridge to transplantation/bridge to recovery, complications during subclavian artery-intra-aortic balloon pump support (eg, stroke, limb ischemia, brachial plexus injury, dissection, bleeding requiring reoperation, and device-related infection), emergent surgery for worsening heart failure, and ambulation during intra-aortic balloon pump support. The duration of balloon support ranged from 3 to 48 days (mean, 17.3 ± 13.1 days). No patients died during subclavian artery-intra-aortic balloon pump support. Of the 20 patients, 14 (70%) were successfully bridged to transplant or left ventricular-assist device. Two patients (10%) required emergent left ventricular-assist device for worsening heart failure. An intra-aortic balloon pump inserted through the subclavian artery is a simple, minimally invasive approach to mechanical support and is associated with limited morbidity and facilitates ambulation in patients with end-stage heart failure."

    "abstract": "Meprobamate tablets contain microcrystalline cellulose, a potent embolic agent that has been shown to cause gangrene in animal studies. Microvascular embolization caused by microcrystalline cellulose can contribute to the ischemic process. We report a case of acute hand ischemia after accidental intra-arterial injection of crushed meprobamate powder in a 23-year-old male drug abuser. The distal tips of the patient's right thumb, index finger, ring finger, and little finger continued to develop gangrene despite medical therapy with heparinization, low molecular-weight dextran infusion, corticosteroid administration, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. We believe this is the first case of acute limb ischemia caused by intra-arterial injection of meprobamate powder documented in humans. Emergency physicians should be aware that accidental intra-arterial injection of crushed oral drug formulations is potentially limb threatening and prompt recognition of similar clinical scenarios is of vital importance."

    "abstract": "An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is used routinely in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery to prevent or treat low-cardiac-output syndrome and to reduce perioperative mortality. The insertion and management of IABP carry the risk of major vascular complications. The authors reviewed their database to ascertain the incidence of IABP-related severe complications. A retrospective study. A teaching hospital. Ten thousand three hundred sixty-five patients scheduled for elective or emergency cardiac surgery over a 12-year period at a single center. Four hundred twenty-three patients received an IABP perioperatively. Careful preoperative screening for peripheral arterial disease, strict postoperative control, and the sheathless insertion technique to spare the arterial flow to the lower limb were performed routinely. The use of a perioperative IABP was 0.7% at the beginning of the observation period in 1999 and 7.3% in 2010, showing a fluctuating trend. Two patients (0.47%) died of direct complications, arterial wall damage and bleeding. Immediate surgical exploration and control of bleeding were followed by multiple-organ failure and death. Vascular complications, leading to lower-limb ischemia, occurred in 4 of 423 patients (0.94%). All of them underwent urgent vascular surgery and survived. Local sepsis occurred in 2 other patients (0.47%). These data indicate that an IABP is a valuable option in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery even if not devoid of intrinsic risks for vascular complications (0.94%), septic complications (0.47%) and mortality (0.47%)."

The puncture site was selected according to duplex scan analysis and physical examination (brachial, crossover, or antegrade). In cases of antegrade approach, a bare needle angiogram of the femoral bifurcation was performed in order to have an adequate distance (>2 cm) from the target lesion. Between January 2010 and August 2011, 64 diabetic patients underwent PTA for ostial SFA lesions. Crossover or brachial approach was electively adopted in 19/64 (30%) patients. The antegrade bare needle angiogram was performed in the remaining 45/64 (70%) patients. In two patients, the vascular anatomy was considered not suitable for antegrade approach, and they were treated in crossover. Technical success was achieved in 38/45 (84%) of patients. During hospital stay, one patient had SFA stent thrombosis treated with urgent bypass grafting. The antegrade approach can be safely performed in most patients presenting with CLI and ostial SFA lesions. The use of clinical and radiographic criteria correctly identifies patients with ostial SFA lesions suitable for an antegrade approach in 42/44 (95%) of cases."

    "abstract": "Choice of cannulation site (femoral, axillary) for cardiopulmonary bypass for thoracic aortic surgery is controversial. We review a single-center consecutive experience with femoral cannulation in the era of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Femoral artery cannulation is our preference for both aneurysms and dissections. If intraoperative TEE (or preoperative computed tomography) shows mobile atheroma, we avoid femoral cannulation and use the right axillary artery. Charts were reviewed to detect any cannulation- or perfusion-related complications. Eight hundred eighty patients underwent cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass for thoracic aortic surgery: 767 femoral (87%) and 113 other (13%, 87 aortic, 22 axillary, 4 innominate). Among the femoral cases, 673 (87.7%) were elective and 94 (12.2%) urgent or emergency. Hospital survival was 723 of 767 (94%): 654 of 673 (97%) for elective cases and 69 of 94 (73%) for urgent or emergency cases. Survivals were 549 of 572 (95%) for ascending and arch, 91 of 97 (93%) for descending, and 83 of 98 (84%) for thoracoabdominal. Stroke (fixed neurologic deficit) occurred in 14 of 767 cases (1.8%): 9 ascending or arch and 5 descending or thoracoabdominal. There were 5 paraplegias in the descending or thoracoabdominal group. There was 1 instance of intraoperative descending dissection (well tolerated), no arterial ruptures, and 6 instances (0.7%) of local femoral arterial narrowing requiring surgical correction (patch graft). One patient (0.1%) had postoperative ischemia of the cannulated limb, and 25 patients (3.2%) had local wound problems (infection 21, seroma 4) treated conservatively. This large experience in the TEE era strongly supports femoral cannulation for aortic surgery, with good survival, low stroke rate, minimal perfusion-related rupture or dissection, and minimal limb ischemia. If intraoperative TEE shows mobile atheroma, axillary cannulation is preferred."

We retrospectively included all patients, from 1997 to 2008, operated on for aortoiliac occlusive disease using an extra-anatomical bypass from a donor iliac artery or a femoral artery to the contralateral femoral artery (common or profunda artery). Demographic data, initial clinical status, characteristics of the interventions, and short- and midterm results were collected. Elective surgery was distinguished from urgent surgery (critical limb ischemia, acute ischemia, vascular infection). One hundred twenty-four femorofemoral bypasses were performed (103 male), mean age 68 (±12) years. Indications were critical limb ischemia (47.1%), intermittent claudication (38.8%), acute ischemia (12.1%), and vascular infections (1.7%). Perioperative outcomes were 5.6% mortality (elective surgery 0.0%, urgent surgery 9.7%, P = 0.02) and 27.4% morbidity without any secondary graft infections (elective surgery 22.5%, urgent surgery 31.9%, P = 0.17). Mean follow-up period was 3 years, and overall survival was 69.4% (elective surgery 88.7%, urgent surgery 56.7%, P = 0.08). At 3 years, primary patency was 81.8% and secondary patency was 89.3% (elective surgery 96.4%, urgent surgery 84.2%, P = 0.68). No significant risk factors for immediate and secondary thromboses were found. In our current practice, femorofemoral bypasses are applied mainly for urgent procedures when avoiding a direct aortic approach is mandatory, with good midterm results. Although indications are limited for good-fit patients, femorofemoral bypass has confirmed safety (no perioperative deaths, no infections) and high durability (good secondary patency)."

Contemporary Analysis of Perioperative Cardiovascular Surgical Care (CAPS-Care) collected detailed perioperative data from 2390 CABG patients between 2004 and 2005 at 55 U.S. hospitals. High-risk elective or urgent CABG patients were eligible for inclusion. We stratified participating hospitals into high, medium, and low tertiles of inotrope use. Hospital-level outcomes were compared before and after risk adjustment for baseline characteristics. Hospital-level risk-adjusted rates of any inotrope/vasopressor use varied from 100% to 35%. Hospitals in the highest tertile of use had more patients with mitral regurgitation compared to medium- or low-use hospitals (p < 0.001), more previous cardiovascular interventions (p = 0.002), longer cardiopulmonary bypass (p < 0.001), longer cross-clamp times (p < 0.001), and required more transfusions (p = 0.001). Despite these differences, unadjusted outcomes were similar between high-, medium-, and low-use hospitals for operative mortality (4.5% vs. 5.3% vs. 5.2%; p = 0.702), 30-day mortality (4.1% vs. 4.6% vs. 5.0%; p = 0.690), postoperative renal failure (7.2% vs. 9.2% vs. 6.6%; p = 0.142), atrial fibrillation (23.0% vs. 27.2% vs. 25.6%; p = 0.106), and acute limb ischemia (0.6% vs. 0.5% vs. 0.5%; p = 0.945). These similar outcomes persisted after risk adjustment: adjusted OR = 0.97 (95% CI [0.94, 1.00], p = 0.086) for operative mortality and adjusted OR = 1.00 (95% CI [0.96, 1.04], p = 0.974) for postoperative renal failure. While considerable variability is present among hospitals in inotrope use following CABG, observational comparison of outcomes did not distinguish a superior pattern; thus, randomized prospective data are needed to better guide clinical practice."

In 76 patients the operations were performed due to critical limb ischemia. Revascularization was urgent in 12 patients, while 76 patients were elective. Dacron prosthesis was used in 81 patients, while PTFE was used in 7 patients. Statistical analysis was made by logistic regression. During hospitalisation the graft remained patent in 82 patients, and graft thrombosis occurred in 6 patients. Limb salvage rate was 90.91%. Early morbidity rate (within the first postoperative month) was 13.64%, while early mortality rate was 4.55%. Using logistic regression we established that early graft patency was statistically more significant in males (p < 0.05). Age (p = 0.07) and hypertension (p = 0.08) appeared to be predicting influence of the graft patency on the border of the accepted statistical significance level.

Interventional therapy, ranging from endovascular procedures (PTCA, stenting) to open surgery (by-passes, TEA, prostheses), remains the only effective weapon against critical acute limb ischemia, offering excellent revascularization rates (80-90%). Conservative treatment, comprehending thrombolysis, prostanoids and anticoagulant drugs recruit the role of invasive methods or are limited, alone, to ineligible patients. Genetics is still far from certain and durable results. AOCP is a long-term severe condition; multifactoriality and asymptomatology in a great number of patients, often justify misdiagnosed cases.

To the best of our knowledge, these are the first three cases reporting the use of the AngioJet rheolytic thrombectomy in ALI due to stent or graft thrombosis.

Patients were divided into two groups based on method used for the treatment of critical ischemia. Group A consisted of 40 patients that were subjected to surgical treatment of critical extremity ischemia during period 2004-2009. All patients were subjected to thrombectomy in local anesthesia (2% lidocaine) as initial step of treatment protocol. Urgent Seldinger angiography was performed for all patients that have undergone thrombectomy regardless of successfulness of thrombectomy. Based on angiography findings decision was made about further definitive treatment. It consisted of either using antiaggregating drugs (acetyl salicylic acid; 150 mg/day) if no significant postthrombectomy stenotic lesion was found or subjecting patients to further surgical revascularization in the form of bypass were significant stenosis or occlusion was identified. Group B consisted of 40 patients; all of them received conventional heparin anticoagulation therapy supplemented with vasoactive infusion treatment (Pentoxyohylline 300 mg/day) during period 1998-2004.

    "abstract": "In critical limb ischemia (CLI), an underlying principle of treatment is that it takes more oxygenated blood to heal a wound than to maintain tissue integrity. Urgent restoration of perfusion to the ischemic territory, not long-term patency of the target vessel, is the primary treatment goal. However, in patients with CLI treated by surgical bypass, loss of graft patency is associated with poor outcomes. We decided to address the conventional wisdom that restenosis is not a major concern in CLI as long as tissue healing occurs in patients undergoing endovascular revascularization. We retrospectively reviewed the records of consecutive patients treated for CLI with infra-popliteal percutaneous revascularization from 2007 to 2009. Those with prior ipsilateral percutaneous revascularization for CLI formed the study population. Among 29 CLI patients treated for infra-popliteal revascularization, six patients had a history of prior successful ipsilateral revascularization for CLI. All six patients were free of rest pain and ulcers at the 60-day follow-up. The median time interval between the two percutaneous revascularization procedures was 21 months (quartile ranges: 25th = 4.5 months, 75th = 36 months). Five of the six patients had restenosis of a previous lesion, while the sixth patient had a de novo lesion causing recurrent CLI. In conclusion, we found that one in five patients receiving infra-popliteal angioplasty for CLI has had a similar percutaneous revascularization procedure in the past. Among these patients most cases were for restenosis rather than de novo lesions. Further research is needed to determine whether the incidence of recurrent CLI is due to de novo lesions or restenosis. Close clinical follow-up of these patients and maintaining long-term patency with endovascular techniques will likely reduce CLI recurrence."

The presence of concomitant vascular disease can only serve to further compromise the complexity of the situation. We demonstrate a new indication for the transthoracic intra-aortic balloon pump as a preoperative means of unloading the heart and improving clinical outcome in such high-risk patients with severe vascular disease. We present the case of a 75-year-old man with a history of severe vascular disease who was transferred emergently to Vanderbilt University Medical Center with an acute inferolateral wall myocardial infarction resulting in severe acute ischemic mitral regurgitation and acute multi-organ failure. He presented with shock liver (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT] of 958), renal failure (creatinine of 3.0), and respiratory failure with a pH of 7.18. Emergent cardiac catheterization revealed 100% occlusion of the left circumflex artery as well as severe ileofemoral disease. The advanced nature of his ileofemoral disease was such that the arterial access catheter occluded the right femoral artery. The duration of time that the catheter was in the artery led to transient limb ischemia with an elevation of his creatine phosphokinase (CPK) to 10,809. Balloon angioplasty followed by stent placement was successfully performed, which restored flow to the coronary vessel. Given the grave nature of the patient's condition, we were very concerned that immediate operative intervention for his condition would entail prohibitively high risk. In fact, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk adjusted mortality was calculated to be 56%. In order to minimize patient mortality and morbidity, it was critical to help restore perfusion and organ recovery. Therefore, we decided that the chances for this patient's survival would improve if his condition could be optimized by placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump before undergoing surgery. Given the limb ischemia following arterial sheath insertion, femoral placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump was not an option. Placement of the intra-aortic balloon pump was attempted via a left subclavian artery cutdown, but was not successful. Therefore, a sternotomy was performed, and we placed a transthoracic intra-aortic balloon pump in order to stabilize the patient's hemodynamics and allow for organ recovery. The patient showed immediate improvement, and 4 days later, the multi-organ failure resolved and he successfully underwent mitral valve replacement. The patient was ultimately discharged to a local rehabilitation facility in satisfactory condition. This case demonstrates the utility of a transthoracic intra-aortic balloon pump as a preoperative means of stabilization in very high risk patients with severe peripheral vascular disease in whom the conventional approaches are not possible."

Over the next few hours, the foot became progressively ischemic and an urgent computed tomography angiogram revealed bilateral popliteal artery aneurysms with acute thrombosis of the aneurysm on the affected limb. The patient underwent emergent femoral popliteal bypass using a Dacron supported interpositional graft. The majority of the foot was salvaged but the toes eventually became necrotic. Direct compression of the aneurysm during reduction of the hip dislocation in conjunction with transiently decreased blood pressure from conscious sedation likely resulted in a low flow state within the artery leading to thrombosis of the aneurysm. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of such an event. This case emphasizes the need for a high index of suspicion for vascular injuries following manipulation of limbs with underlying arterial aneurysms. Reduction maneuvers for hip dislocations should be modified to minimize compression of the popliteal fossa in limbs with vascular abnormalities. Serial postreduction neurovascular exams are essential for identification and prompt management of vascular complications."

    "abstract": "To investigate the security and efficiency of endovascular repair for Stanford type B aortic dissection (AD) with severe complications. Between January 2003 and December 2009, 60 patients having Stanford type B AD with severe complications were treated, including 39 males and 21 females with an average age of 43.7 years (range, 34-71 years). Severe complications included 27 cases of huge hemothorax, 1 case of paraplegia, 7 cases of acute renal failure, 10 cases of celiac trunk ischemia, 10 cases of superior mesenteric artery ischemia, and 5 cases of severe limb ischemia. Emergency stent-graft deployment were applied in all patients, and 64 stent-grafts were successfully implanted. All patients survived and were followed up 3-86 months. Hemothorax disappeared after 28 days to 3 months of operation in all hemothorax patients; renal function returned normal after 1 to 9 days; limb and visceral ischemia disappeared gradually after 1 to 14 days; and muscular strength of lower limb in the paraplegia patient began to recover after 4 hours of operation. The postoperative CT angiography showed enlarged true lumen and thrombosis in the false lumen. Emergency endovascular repair is a safe and effective method to treat Stanford type B AD with severe complications."

    "abstract": "Posterior elbow dislocations are the most common type of elbow dislocation and are usually caused by a fall on an outstretched hand. Although the incidence of elbow dislocation complications is rare, the emergency physician is responsible for evaluation and identification of concomitant neurovascular injuries. Failure to identify neurovascular compromise after elbow dislocation or reduction can potentially lead to severe morbidity with limb ischemia, neurologic changes, compartment syndrome, and potential loss of limb. Cyanosis, pallor, pulselessness, and marked pain should suggest vascular injury or compartment syndrome, both requiring immediate intervention. Patients in whom it is not clear if there is vascular injury should undergo further imaging with angiography, considered the gold standard for evaluation of arterial damage. It is important for the emergency physician to maintain a high level of suspicion and evaluate for neurovascular compromise on every patient with elbow dislocation despite the low overall incidence of severe injury."

This is a case report of a patient with aortoaortic tube graft, who present critical left limb ischemia immediately after surgical procedure. Angiography showed complete occlusion of left common iliac artery, affecting the distal graft anastomosis. The occlusion was resolved with endovascular treatment, and a noncovered, self-expanding, nitinol stent was deployed (primary stenting) covering the distal bypass anastomosis, with no complications and complete lower limb perfusion recovery. One month later, the patient was still asymptomatic, with distal pulse palpable and ankle-brachial index 1."

Endovascular interventions with stent-graft prostheses are a less invasive alternative and may obviate the need for surgery in most cases. We report here on our five years' experience with endovascular stenting in complicated acute type B dissections. Between March 2001 and January 2006, 32 patients (27 males, 5 females) with a mean age of 61.4+/-11.32 years (range 29-80) underwent stent grafting for complicated acute type B dissections. Indications were progression of dissection with impending rupture (n=10), uncontrollable hypertension (n=9), intractable thoracic pain (n=7), and malperfusion syndrome (n=6). Talent-Medtronic (n=34) and Excluder-Gore (n=3) stent-grafts were used. In 5 patients two stents were necessary. In addition to stent grafting, aortic fenestration was performed in all three cases with lower limb ischemia. Endovascular stent placement was successful in all patients. Hospital mortality was 9.3% (3/32). No deaths occurred during follow-up (mean 32 months). Endovascular stenting of complicated acute type B dissections represents a safe alternative to surgery. Endovascular stent-grafts of appropriate sizes should be readily available in the hospital for emergency use, thus avoiding delays in treatment."

    "abstract": "Acute pulmonary embolism requires ICU management only for patients with hemodynamic instability who need artificial ventilation, or for hemodynamically stable patients with significant right ventricular dysfunction. For both patient groups, echocardiography is the most relevant diagnostic method. The main therapeutic consideration is on systemic thrombolysis. It is indicated in almost all patients with hemodynamic instability but only in selected cases of right ventricular dysfunction. All other patients receive standard anticoagulation only. A second vascular emergency scenario is type 2 heparin-induced thrombocytopeniae (HIT II) which may cause venous as well as arterial complications. Alternative anticoagulation has to be established from the first moment of clinical suspicion. It has to be continued in a therapeutic dosage if HIT II is confirmed, and has to be stopped if the diagnosis is refuted. The latter case is by far more frequent. Regarding arterial occlusions (acute limb ischemia, acral gangrene, iatrogenic vascular trauma) hints are given for the management in the setting of intensive care."

In order to avoid the risk of genetic materials or injury in collection of implanted cells, a basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) sustained release system using cross-linked gelatin microspheres was developed for therapeutic angiogenesis. In this study, gelatin microspheres (MSs) and the complex of MSs and bFGF (MSs-bFGF) were prepared. MSs and MSs-bFGF were analyzed for morphology, particle size, in vitro bFGF release and the bioactivity of the released medium. MSs-bFGF was intramuscularly implanted into the ischemic hind limb of a dog and free bFGF, empty MSs and untreated animals were used as controls. Histological examination was performed for angiogenesis evaluation. After immersion in an aqueous solution, the un-cross-linked MSs became deformed and adhered together. The cross-linked MSs showed a more stable character both in vivo and in vitro. The bFGF released from MSs remained bioactive. The histological examination indicated that the densities of micro-vessels in the MSs-bFGF-treated hind limb muscle were significantly greater than that in the untreated control, free bFGF and empty MSs groups. The MSs-bFGF sustained release system was a simple, safe and effective way to achieve therapeutic angiogenesis in an ischemic limb."

Cases of HH were also reported under specific conditions such as heat stroke, grand mal seizure, obstructive sleep apnea, and complicated aortic aneurysm. In this study, we report 5 cases of HH occurring in the course of acute lower limb ischemia (ALLI). To the best of our knowledge, the association between HH and ALLI has not yet been reported. In a prospective and consecutive series of 142 cases of HH, we identified 5 cases (3.5%) in which ALLI was the triggering condition. The clinical, hemodynamic, and liver laboratory data of these 5 cases are reported. A review of the literature on liver injury observed in the case of ALLI is also made. The 5 patients were 4 males and 1 female of mean age 63 years. All 5 had typical HH after ALLI. Four of them were in shock on admission. Arterial blood pH lower than 7.15 was observed upon admission in the 3 patients who died. Other potential causes of liver hypoxia were present in all patients. Urgent and efficient revascularization of the ischemic limb was a necessary condition for survival. Acute lower limb ischemia should be added to the list of conditions able to trigger HH. In this particular setting, urgent revascularization of the ischemic limb seems to be a prerequisite for survival."

Investigations revealed a pedunculated mass in the aortic arch, floating under the innominate and left common carotid arteries. Urgent resection was performed through a longitudinal aortotomy with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest and axillary artery perfusion to reveal a 2.5 x 1.5 cm pedunculated mass attached to the posterior aspect of the arch that was resected. Histology revealed thrombus material prompting lifelong systemic anticoagulation. On 3 months follow-up, the patient had returned to normal activities and computed tomography confirmed complete resection without recurrence. This case study demonstrates that spontaneous thrombus formation is possible in high-flow vascular regions such as the aortic arch and also confirms the importance of evaluating central sources of thromboemboli in patients presenting with acute limb ischemia. Urgent surgical removal is recommended and can be performed safely."

The goal of this study is to relate preoperative functional status, a defined metric in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database, to perioperative MM. Between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2007, all patients who underwent BPG from the NSQIP private sector database were reviewed. The primary end-point was 30-day MM. Patients were stratified by preoperative functional status: independent (IND) vs dependent (DEP). Associated patient demographic/clinical data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate methods. Composite odds ratios were constructed with clusters of high-risk comorbidities. There were 5639 BPG patients (4600 [81.6%] IND and 1039 [18.4%]) DEP. DEP patients were significantly older (71.6 +/- 11.8 vs 66.8 +/- 11.8 years; P < .0001), had more chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (16.7% vs 11.4%; P < .0001), diabetes (54.2% vs 40.7%; P < .0001), dialysis dependence (16.4% vs 5.6%; P < .0001), and critical limb ischemia (64.6% vs 44.0%; P < .0001). DEP patients had a higher incidence of death (6.1% vs 1.5%; P < .0001) and major complications (30.3% vs 14.2%; P < .0001). DEP was an independent predictor of major complications (odds ratio [OR]: 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [1.7-2.4]; P < .0001) major systemic complications (2.5 [1.9-3.2]; P < .0001), major operative site complications (1.6 [1.4-1.9]; P < .0001) and death (2.3[1.6-3.4]; P < .0001). The combination of DEP with emergency surgery, Cr > 1.8, or rest pain increased the odds of major complications by five, seven, or 11-fold, respectively. The combination of DEP with hemodialysis, emergency surgery, or age > or = 80 years increased the odds of death by 13, 38, or 87-fold, respectively. Preoperative DEP is significantly correlated with all adverse 30-day outcomes in BPG patients. Furthermore, when combined in high-risk composites with specific preoperative clinical variables, DEP is associated with prohibitive MM, thereby identifying patient cohorts that may be unsuitable for BPG."

The patient's hemoglobin levels dropped postoperatively, but there was no obvious bleeding, hemodynamic instability, pulsatile mass, or limb ischemia. The patient's hemoglobin levels continued to drop despite nine units of transfused blood. Three days after surgery, the patient underwent an angiography that showed an avulsion injury to a posterior branch of the profunda femoral artery. The avulsion was ligated and the hematoma was evacuated. Vascular damage may present in many ways including obvious bleeding, haemodynamic instability, a pulsatile mass, limb ischemia, and occult blood loss. Any of these signs in isolation or in combination could represent a vascular injury and an urgent angiogram should be considered."

There are conflicting reports concerning the usefulness of risk scales (P-POSSUM, APACHE, SAPS, ASA, Goldman, etc.) in vascular surgery. We decided to take a fresh look at preoperative risk factors of early death in the context of the usefulness of some parameters which have not been included in existing risk calculators. The study group consisted of 1270 patients treated at the Department of Vascular Surgery, General Surgery, and Angiology, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin, during one year. METHOD This was a prospective non-randomized study. All data recorded at admission and data from P-POSSUM, ASA, Goldman, and ECOG-Zubroda-WHO scales were analyzed. Statistics were done with discriminant, multivariate, and logistic tests. There were 42 early deaths in the group. The following independent risk factors were involved in early death: ASA > 2 (OR = 18.31), persistent atrial fibrillation (OR = 5.75), leukocytosis (OR = 13.31), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (OR = 5.78), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) (OR = 11.36), emergency admission (OR = 38.62), critical limb ischemia (OR = 4.87), acute limb ischemia (OR = 8,98), abdominal aortic aneurysm (OR = 4.4), and ruptured aortic aneurysm (OR = 10.59). Logistic regression exposed the influence of five factors: ASA III, ASA IV, persistent atrial fibrillation, leukocytosis, GFR < 30 mL/kg/1.73 m2, and ruptured aortic aneurysm. The P-POSSUM calculator was found to be an accurate predictor of early death although the predicted death rate was insignificantly higher than the observed rate. Risk scales of early death currently used in vascular surgery need to be \"refreshed\". Creation of the Polish National Vascular Surgery Register seems to be unavoidable."

We retrospectively reviewed the records of hemodynamically stable patients with isolated lower extremity gunshot wounds seen at our urban, university-based trauma center and who were discharged from the emergency department. Evaluation consisted of determining which patients were hemodynamically normal, had no fractures, and had an ABI > or =0.9. Patients with an ABI <0.9 underwent CT angiography. We then applied this practice algorithm prospectively, adding evaluation of high probability proximity wounds by ultrasonography or CT angiography to rule out missed injuries. The retrospective review identified 182 patients who met our criteria. None had bleeding, limb ischemia, or limb loss. The specificity of the evaluation in the retrospective study to predict safe discharge was 100%, with a negative predictive value of 98%. There were 90 patients in the prospective study. Bleeding, limb ischemia, or limb loss did not develop in any patient. The prospective algorithm for predicting safe discharge home had a 100% positive predictive value and 98% negative predictive value. Using this algorithm, costs were 992 dollars per patient. If every patient received ultrasonography or CT angiography, it would have been 1,135 dollars or 4,632 dollars, respectively, per patient. Hemodynamically normal patients with lower extremity gunshot wounds without fracture and an initial ABI > or =0.9 can be discharged safely from the emergency department without additional diagnostic imaging, potentially saving health care costs."

    "abstract": "Using 30-day operative mortality reported with lower extremity bypass (LEB) in preoperative decision making may underestimate the actual death rate encountered before patients have truly recovered from surgery, especially in elderly, debilitated patients with significant tissue loss. Therefore, we examined preoperative, patient-level risk factors that predict survival within the first year following LEB. Using our regional quality improvement initiative in 11 hospitals in Northern New England, we studied 2306 LEB procedures performed in 2031 patients between January 2003 and December 2007. Sixty surgeons contributed to our database, and over 100 demographic and clinical variables were abstracted by trained researchers. Cox proportional hazards models were used to generate hazard ratios (HR) and surrounding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for our combined outcome measure of death occurring within the first year postoperatively. We found that within our cohort of 2306 bypass procedures, 11% of patients died within 1 year of surgery (2% prior to discharge, 9% prior to 1-year follow-up). We identified six preoperative patient characteristics associated with higher risk of death in multivariate analysis: congestive heart failure (HR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.8), diabetes (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.1), critical limb ischemia (CLI) (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3-2.4), lack of single-segment saphenous vein (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.5-2/5), age over 80 (HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.5-2.7), dialysis dependence (HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.9-3.6), and emergent nature of the procedure (HR 3.4, 95% CI 1.7-6.8). While patients with no risk factors had 1-year death rates that were less than 5%: patients with three or more risk factors had a 28% chance of dying before 1 year postoperatively. When we compared risk-adjusted survival across centers, we found that one center in our region performed significantly better than expected (observed-to-expected outcome ratio 0.7, 95% CI 0.6-0.9, P = .04). Preoperative risk factors allow surgeons to predict survival in the first year following LEB, and to more precisely inform patients about their operative risk with LEB. Additionally, our model facilitates benchmarking comparison of risk-adjusted outcomes across our region. We believe quality improvement measures such as these will allow surgeons to identify best practices and thereby improve outcomes with LEB across centers."

Results from Clermont-Ferrand and Saint-Etienne hospitals have been collected. Between January 1993 and December 2001, 61 patients (59 men and two women, mean age 65 years) underwent a partial or complete second aortic reconstruction through a direct approach. Three different indications that required redo surgery were detected. Twenty-three patients presented with an infection (37%), 17 with an occlusive pathology (28%), and 21 with an aneurysm (34%). Medical or endoluminal treatment could no longer be considered. Mean period of time for redo surgery was 101 months (range 1-294). Eighteen of the procedures were emergency surgeries. A polyester prosthesis was used in 45 cases, an arterial allograft in 15 cases, and autogenous venous material in one case. In 22 cases (36%) a visceral, renal, or infracrural revascularization was associated. Four patients died (6.5%): three with an infection and one with an occlusive pathology. Global morbidity rate was 64%. Twelve vascular surgical complications (19%) required redo surgery: seven limb ischemia, three hemorrhage, and two colic ischemia. The preoperative factors generating severe complications were a septic context, renal insufficiency, and American Society of Anesthesiologists grade 3 or 4. Follow-up concerned the 57 surviving patients with a 43-month mean period of time (range 4-105). Actuarial survival rate was 80.7% at 3 years and could be compared to that observed after infrarenal aortic first surgery. Primary and secondary global patency rates were, respectively, 66.4 +/- 6.7% and 94.6 +/- 3% at 3 years with no major amputation. In our series including 37% of septic patients and nearly 30% of patients operated on in emergency, aortic iterative surgery led to mortality and morbidity rates twice and four times as important as those resulting from infrarenal aortic initial surgery, respectively. In the long term, patient survival and limb salvage rates were quite similar to those obtained with de novo surgery."

    "title": "Acute limb ischemia.",
    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia occurs when there is an abrupt interruption of blood flow to an extremity usually because of either embolic or thrombotic vascular occlusion. When profound ischemia ensues, this represents an emergency in which restoration of perfusion through early intervention can lead to limb salvage, whereas delay may result in significant morbidity, including limb loss and, potentially, death. Patients in whom urgent or semi-urgent surgical or endovascular revascularization is indicated may undergo catheter angiography unless there is a contraindication, such as profound critical limb ischemia, renal dysfunction, or contrast allergy. Alternative imaging modalities include ultrasound, contrast-enhanced computed tomographic angiography, and magnetic resonance angiography. The clinical degree of the ischemic insult will determine the most appropriate course of management, as severely ischemic limbs may require immediate surgical revascularization, while endovascular interventions, such as catheter-directed thrombolysis, may be appropriate in patients with moderate ischemia. Additionally, many percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy devices are being used or undergoing clinical evaluation, either alone or in combination with pharmacologic thrombolysis, for the treatment of acute limb-threatening ischemia. In this article, we present our approach to an acutely ischemic limb, with a focus on the pertinent aspects of endovascular intervention."

Fifteen patients had ingested cardiotoxic drugs, including 11 cases of drugs with membrane stabilizing activity. Time from hospital admission to initiation of ECLS was 6.4 +/- 7.0 hours. Time to ECLS implant was 58 +/- 11 minutes. The mean ECLS flow rate was 3.45 +/- 0.45 L/min. The average ECLS duration was 4.5 +/- 2.4 days. Early complications included limb ischemia (n = 6), femoral thrombus (n = 1), cava inferior thrombus (n = 1), and severe bleeding at the site of cannulation (n = 2). Fifteen patients were weaned off ECLS support and 13 (76%) were discharged to hospital without sequelae. Based on our experience, we consider ECLS as a last resort, efficient, and relatively safe therapeutic option in this population. However, the uncontrolled nature of our data requires careful interpretation."

    "abstract": "Aortic thrombus is rare in patients with essential thrombocytosis (ET), so the optimal treatment remains undefined. A 45-year-old man with history of ET, under chronic treatment with aspirin, presented to the emergency department complaining of acute onset in both the legs and abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed that both dorsalis pedis pulses were not palpable with cold and pale feet. His abdomen was soft and nondistended. The platelet count was 436 x 10(9)/L. The thoraco-abdominal computerized tomographic scanning revealed normal aortic diameter with supraceliac and infrarenal nonoccluding thrombus and infarction areas in spleen and left kidney. At the emergency department he presented with recurrent symptoms, losing bilateral posterior tibial pulses. A decision was made to perform a thoracoretroperitoneal incision. A longitudinal sequential aortotomy was performed in the distal thoracic and infrarenal aorta, and the thrombus was easily removed. Following this, he underwent bilateral crural thrombectomy and local intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy. The postoperative course was uneventful. The left toes were amputated because of necrosis. He was discharged and put on antiaggregants, anticoagulants and hydroxyurea. Aortic thrombus in patients with ET is unusual, but potentially lethal. There is complete relief from symptoms in recurrent cases following surgery. An appropriate medical treatment after intervention must be supported."

    "abstract": "Time to revascularization is speculated to be a major determinant of limb salvage for traumatic popliteal injuries. The purpose of this study was to determine whether location of diagnostic arteriography affected outcome. From 1996 to 2006, patients with popliteal injuries were identified from our trauma database. Additional data were extracted from chart review. Amputation rates for those undergoing arteriography performed in radiology (ARAD) versus the operating room (AOR) were compared. In 35 patients 36 limbs were treated, with 94% resulting from blunt mechanisms. The mean age was 37 years (11-69 years), 81% were men, and the mean Injury Severity Score was 15. The average mangled extremity severity scores (MESS) was 6 +/- 2. Follow-up was available in 97% patients with a median of 14 months. Overall amputation rate was 16.7% (6 of 36). Extremities with MESS <8 had 93% limb salvage, and MESS > or =8 had 55% limb salvage. ARAD (n = 10) and AOR (n = 15) groups were equivalent with regard to age, mechanism, Injury Severity Score, MESS, time to presentation, associated injuries, and fasciotomy rate. The median time from emergency room arrival to operating room was shorter (125 minutes vs. 214 minutes; p < 0.05) and salvage rate was higher (100% vs. 70%; p = 0.05) in the AOR group compared with the ARAD group. For popliteal artery injuries, diagnostic arteriography in the operating room reduces the likelihood of amputation by decreasing time to initiating repair and thereby limiting limb ischemia. Salvage is possible in the most severely injured extremities with rapid transport to the operating room."

    "abstract": "There are very few population-based studies of long-term outcomes after lower extremity (LE) bypass graft surgery. This study analyzes perioperative and long-term limb salvage and amputation-free survival outcomes for patients undergoing initial aortoiliac or femoropopliteal bypass graft surgery in California hospitals from 1996 to 1999. Administrative data with encrypted identifiers were used to identify a chronologically first, index admission of all patients undergoing LE bypass procedures for occlusive disease from 1996 to 1999. A 1993 to 1995 look-back period was used to exclude patients who had undergone prior bypass surgery or amputation procedures. Patients with incident procedures were then followed forward to determine subsequent hospitalizations and vital status through 2004. The study comprised 28,128 patients discharged from 345 California hospitals with a median 61.5-month follow-up. Risk factors included demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, admission type, gangrene or ulceration, operation level, hospital LE bypass surgery volume, and year of discharge. Logistic regression was used to analyze 30-day outcomes, and Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze amputation-free survival. Overall 30-day mortality was 4.3, and the 30-day major amputation rate was 2.6%. Limb salvage was 81.9% at 5 years and 76.4% at 9 years. Amputation-free survival was 51.5% at 5 years and 34.1% at 9 years. Risk factors were generally similar for both perioperative and late outcomes. Advanced age, higher comorbidity level, gangrene, and emergency or nursing home admission conferred significantly greater risk. Hospital volume was associated with both perioperative and late outcomes. African American and Hispanic patients had much higher amputation rates but did not have higher mortality risk after controlling for baseline severity of illness. Long-term outcomes of LE bypass surgery were superior for high-volume hospital patients. Graft surveillance and risk factor follow-up care provide a major opportunity for quality improvement efforts. The contrast between traditional limb salvage and amputation-free survival outcomes raises questions about the value of surgical treatment, particularly for patients with limited life expectancy and without coding of tissue loss or critical limb ischemia."

In addition, 3 patients presented with peripheral embolism with impending limb ischemia that necessitated emergency embolectomy. Echocardiography was generally enough for the demonstration of the myxomas. Two sporadic myxomas (%2.98) and one familial myxomas (1.49%) presented with recurrence. There were three (4.47%) hospital mortalities. Two patients (2.27%), with preoperative decompensation, died after tumor resection, from progressive low cardiac output. One patient, with preoperative massive pulmonary embolus, died two days after operation, from right ventricle insufficient. In conclusion, we herein summarized surgical results with primary cardiac myxomas. Surgical excision of primary cardiac myxomas tends to show excellent results after surgical excision."

    "abstract": "Up to 50% of all popliteal artery aneurysms (PAA) present with acute limb ischemia (ALI). ALI due to PAA is a difficult surgical problem, with a 20% to 60% incidence of limb loss and up to 12% mortality reported in the literature in the last three decades. Imminent limb threat requires emergency infrainguinal reconstruction, preferably with autogenous conduit. ALI due to PAA is limb-threatening, often due to obliteration of the tibial vessels in addition to thrombosis of the PAA itself. Arteriography is needed to define inflow vessel and outflow vessel anatomy followed by thrombectomy of the run-off vasculature to establish an appropriate target for bypass. Patients without evidence of neurologic deficit are best served by formal arteriography. Intraarterial thrombolysis is used to establish an outflow vessel for bypass if no runoff vessels are visible. In general, emergency operations are associated with inferior patency and limb salvage compared to elective procedures. Endovascular exclusion of PAA with covered stent graft is used increasingly in the elective setting and has been reported in patients presenting with limb ischemia. The following discussion outlines our algorithm in managing ALI from PAA and reviews management decisions and results of treatment."

The aim of the study was to evaluate the progression of compartment syndrome by measuring of intracompartmental pressure and monitoring of decreased tissular oxygenation, indicating an insufficient secondary microcirculation. 16 patients were examined in our study (12 males, 4 females, mean age: 62.7+/-9.5 years), who underwent acute lower limb revascularization surgery for a critical (lasting more than 4 hours) limb ischemia. The indications were: 5 iliac artery embolizations and 11 femoral artery occlusions. After revascularization, on the second postoperative day, we detected significant lower limb edema and swelling of several grade. To monitor the elevated intracompartmental pressure (ICP) and to evaluate the extremital circulation, we used KODIAG pressure meter and the tissular oxygen saturation (StO2) was measured by near-infrared-spectroscopy. In 12 cases the ICP exceeded the critical 40 mmHg. In these patients the average StO2 was 50-53%, in spite of complete recanalization. In these cases we made urgent, semi-open fasciotomy. In 4 cases, where the clinical aspect showed compartment syndrome, the measured parameters did not indicate a surgical intervention (ICP: 25-35 mmHg, StO2: around normal). A novel approach in our examination is that, besides empirical therapeutic guidelines generally applied in clinical practice, we established an objective, parameter-based (\"evidence based medicine\") surgical indication strategy for the lower limb compartment syndrome. Our parameter results produced by the above pressure and saturation measurements help the clinicians to decide between conservative and operative treatment of the disease."

However, given the multitude of injected substances and complex pathophysiology, guidelines regarding diagnosis and management of patients with intraarterial injections remain vague. As such it remains unclear, when to expect limb ischemia and whether and for how long to monitor patients after intraarterial injections. We present the case of a \"near miss event\" in an i.v. drug abuser presenting to the emergency department 3 hours after injection of water dissolved zolpidem (Ambientrade mark) tablets into the right ulnar artery. Chief complaint was forearm pain. Clinical examination at the time revealed no concern for limb ischemia and patient was discharged. The patient returned unplanned 18 hours after injection with an ischemic right hand. Angiography revealed no flow in the distal ulnar artery and minimal flow in the palmar arch. Emergent intraarterial thrombolysis with Urokinase was performed and restored hand perfusion. Clinical follow-up 3 months after injury showed full recovery with regular recapillarisation and normal Allen test. This case report highlights the need to rigorously monitor patients with suspected intraarterial injections for potential delayed onset of limb ischemia. This is to our knowledge the first described case report of a successful revascularization after prolonged ischemia with delayed onset after zolpidem injection. We recommend close monitoring of these patients for at least 24 hours in addition to starting prophylactic anticoagulation."

This study was designed to assess the effect of 72 hr iloprost infusion on systemic ischemia post-open elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (EAAA) surgery. Between January 2000 and 2007, 104 patients undergoing open EAAA were identified: 36 had juxtarenal, 15 had suprarenal, and 53 had infrarenal aneurysms, with a mean maximal diameter of 6.9 cm. The male-to-female ratio was 2.5:1, with a mean age of 71.9 years. No statistically significant difference was seen between the study groups with regard to age, sex, risk factors, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, or diameter of aneurysm repaired. All emergency, urgent, and endovascular procedures for aneurysms were excluded. Fifty-seven patients received iloprost infusion for 72 hr in the immediate postoperative period compared with 47 patients who did not. Patients were monitored for signs of pulmonary, renal, cardiac, systemic ischemia, and postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) morbidity. Statistically significantly increased ventilation rates (p=0.0048), pulmonary complication rates (p=0.0019), and myocardial ischemia (p=0.0446) were noted in those patients not receiving iloprost. These patients also had significantly higher renal indices including estimate glomerular filtration rate changes (p=0.041) and postoperative urea level rises (p=0.0286). Peripheral limb trashing was noted in five patients (11.6%) in the non-iloprost group compared with no patients who received iloprost. Increased rates of transfusion requirements and bowel complications were noted in those who did not receive iloprost, with their ICU stay greater than twice that of iloprost patients. All-cause morbidity affected 67% of patients not receiving iloprost compared to 40% who did. Survival rates were significantly better with iloprost than without in both 30-day (p=0.009) and 5-year cumulative (p=0.0187) survival. Iloprost infusion for 72 hr after open AAA repair was associated with improved systemic perfusion and decreased systemic ischemia. Patients had a significant survival benefit at 30 days and 5 years and significantly improved renal, cardiac, and respiratory function."

Seventeen patients (12 women; mean age 68.3+/-10.7 years) enrolled in a prospective registry underwent IVUS imaging at baseline, after treatment with P-PS using tissue plasminogen activator and RT (AngioJet), and prior to definitive treatment of the vessel. The primary safety endpoints were major bleeding, distal embolization, vascular access complications, and renal failure. Effectiveness outcomes were (1) procedural success with a residual stenosis <30%, (2) IVUS-documented resolution of the thrombus, and (3) the combined clinical endpoint of procedure-related death, stroke, unplanned amputation, and unplanned urgent revascularization of the treated limb. At baseline, the majority of patients (16, 94.1%) had a definite thrombus identified by IVUS; in the remaining patient (6.3%), thrombus was likely to be present according to the IVUS scan. By angiography, 2 (11.8%) patients had a definite grade 3 thrombus and 5 (29.4%) patients had a grade 1 thrombus (modified TIMI scale) at baseline. IVUS data were available pre and post P-PS/RT in 16 (94.1%) patients. In 10 (62.5%), the thrombus was partially resolved; in 5 (31.25%), there was no apparent change. The thrombus appeared to have completely resolved in only 1 (6.3%) patient. Embolization occurred in 3 (17.6%) patients with no adverse clinical sequelae. The combined clinical endpoint was met in 1 (5.9%) of 17 patients. After final definitive treatment of the vessel, acute procedural success was 100%, with no angiographic filling defects seen. Thrombus is present in most if not all patients with a recent history of limb ischemia who are found to have an occluded culprit vessel. The application of the P-PS/RT led to partial or complete thrombus resolution in about two thirds of the patients treated. The overall safety outcome was favorable, but large studies are needed to test the effectiveness of the P-PS/RT technique prior to routine use."

Complications included contained rupture, hemothorax, refractory chest pain, and severe visceral or lower limb ischemia. Stent-graft types included custom-made first-generation endografts and second-generation commercial stent-grafts (Gore Excluder or TAG; W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc, Flagstaff, Ariz.). Follow-up was 100% complete, averaged 36 +/- 36 months, and included postprocedural surveillance computed tomographic scans. Early mortality was 25% +/- 11% (70% confidence limit), with no late deaths. No new neurologic complications occurred. According to the latest scan, 4 patients (25%) had complete thrombosis of the false lumen; the lumen was partially thrombosed in 6 patients (38%). Distal aortic diameter was increased in only 1 patient. Actuarial survival at 1 and 5 years was 73% +/- 11%; freedom from treatment failure (including aortic rupture, device fault, reintervention, aortic death, or sudden, unexplained late death) was 67% +/- 14% at 5 years. With follow-up to 9 years, endovascular stent-grafting for patients with complicated acute type B aortic dissection conferred benefit.

These injuries present with life-threatening bleedings, associated regional injuries and critical limb ischemia and although surgery has been considered the treatment of choice, subclavian injuries pose a real surgical challenge. We prospectively examined data of six patients presenting with penetrating subclavian artery injuries that were treated by urgent endovascular stent-graft placements. All stent-grafts were deployed successfully achieving complete exclusion of the pseudoaneurysm, control of bleeding and reconstruction of the injured artery. No procedural complications, stent thrombosis or stent infections occurred during hospitalization. One patient developed stenosis at 7 months, which required angioplasty. The series mean clinical and ultrasound-CTA follow-up is 38+/-19.7 months (range 11-60 months) and 28+/-19.1 months (range 6-58 months), respectively. This series shows the feasibility of endovascular repair by means of stent-grafts for selected patients with acute penetrating injuries of the subclavian arteries. This approach proved to be safe and effective in restoring the arterial lumen and patency, excluding the pseudoaneurysms and controlling the bleeding caused by subclavian lacerations. Mid-term follow-up on stent-graft patency rates are encouraging."

The most important known risk factors are nicotine, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipoproteinemia. Patients suffering from PAD run a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events and therefore should be on permanent antithrombotic therapy as secondary prophylaxis. Besides clinical examination and determination of the ankle/brachial index, complementary imaging is mandatory. Here angiography is the gold standard.

Recent reports using DES in patients with CLI have documented excellent short-term infrapopliteal vessel patency. Higher primary patency rates in infrapopliteal vessels treated with DES could translate into better long-term clinical outcomes and improved limb salvage rates. Twenty-four consecutive patients with CLI (defined as rest pain, nonhealing ulcers, or gangrene) because of severe infrapopliteal disease were treated with DES from August 2004 to June 2006. Procedural success was achieved in 96% (27/28) of targeted lesions. There were no procedure-related deaths, acute vessel thrombosis events, or need for urgent surgical intervention. There was one case of distal embolization. Clinical follow up, ranging 8-34 months, is available for 100% of patients of which 83% (20/24) achieved limb preservation and healing.

DES is a safe and effective long-term option for CLI due to severe infrapopliteal arterial disease. Long-term vascular patency led to a high rate of limb preservation and low amputation rate.

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to validate the Finnvasc score for prediction of immediate outcome after infrainguinal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for critical lower limb ischemia (CLI). Our registry included prospective data on 512 patients who underwent isolated infrainguinal PTA revascularization procedures for CLI. The Finnvasc score herein evaluated was calculated by assigning one point each to diabetes, coronary artery disease, foot gangrene, and urgent operation. Early mortality and major limb amputation rates after PTA revascularization were 2.5% and 12.3%, respectively. Seventy-two patients (14.1%) died and/or had lower limb amputation. Diabetes (p = 0.001), foot gangrene (p = 0.047), urgent operation (p < 0.0001), and preoperative renal failure (p = 0.001) were independent predictors of postoperative mortality and/or major limb amputation. Finnvasc score was predictive of major lower limb amputation (p = 0.003), mortality (p < 0.0001), and mortality and/or major amputation (p < 0.0001) after PTA. Mortality, major lower limb amputation, and combined end point rates in patients with a Finnvasc score of 3-4 were 12.8%, 25.6%, and 35.9%, respectively. The Finnvasc score is a simple risk scoring method which can be useful to estimate the risk of immediate postprocedural mortality and/or major lower limb amputation also in patients undergoing infrainguinal PTA for CLI."

    "abstract": "Foot infections are common among diabetic patients with ulceration and are a major cause of hospitalization and lower extremity amputation. Aggressive and emergent surgical intervention is essential in the face of life- or limb-threatening infection to achieve limb salvage and survival. Critical limb ischemia, neuropathy, and an impaired host complicate the treatment of a severe diabetic foot infection. A severe diabetic foot infection carries a 25% risk of major amputation. For this reason, surgery should be coordinated with a well-functioning multidisciplinary team that specializes in diabetic limb preservation. Timing of surgery and strategies employed should be understood and agreed on by both the surgical and medical disciplines managing the diabetic patient with a limb-threatening infection. The overall strategy for surgically managing a severe diabetic foot infection is as follows: the first step is infection control through aggressive and extensive surgical debridement, the second step is a comprehensive vascular assessment with possible vascular surgery and/or endovascular intervention, and the final step is soft tissue and skeletal reconstruction after infection is eradicated to obtain wound closure and limb salvage. A consistent stepwise surgical approach combined with sound surgical principles is paramount for successful management of the severe diabetic foot infection. The authors discuss their stepwise surgical approach to reduce the mortality, morbidity, psychological distress, and length of hospitalization associated with life- or limb-threatening diabetic foot infections."

    "abstract": "Because there is a paucity of data about management and outcome of true profunda femoris artery aneurysms (PFAAs), we reviewed our 21-year experience with surgical repair of PFAAs. Clinical data from the 15 patients who underwent repair between 1985 and 2006 were retrospectively reviewed. Fifteen men had 17 PFAAs (mean diameter, of 3.4 cm). Three had an acute presentation with rupture (n = 2) or acute limb ischemia (n = 1), one had local tenderness, and 11 were asymptomatic. Sizes of the ruptured PFAAs were 1.5 and 7.5 cm. Eleven patients (73%) had synchronous aneurysms, most frequently in the popliteal artery (n = 7). Three of the asymptomatic patients required an emergency operation because of acute lower extremity ischemia caused by thrombosis of a synchronous popliteal aneurysm (n = 2) or for a ruptured iliac aneurysm (n = 1). Aneurysmectomy with graft interposition between the common femoral and PFA was used in 15 repairs. Ligation alone was used for one aneurysm, and another was treated by partial aneurysmectomy with primary repair. There were no deaths, graft thrombosis, or limb loss at 30 days. At a mean follow-up of 28 months (range, 3 to 108 months), one patient required above knee amputation 2 years after aneurysm ligation, and another patient presented with a recurrent aneurysm. Long-term graft patency was 100%. PFAAs are rare but often occur with synchronous aneurysms. One-third of patients presented with complications of limb ischemia or rupture caused by their PFAA or synchronous aneurysms. Good-risk patients with a PFAA >2 cm should undergo elective repair. Aneurysmectomy with femoral interposition graft is a durable repair."

We tested whether the intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP) could give us the necessary time for clinical decision-making and preserve adequate circulation until it is made. We assessed 11 dilated cardiomyopathy patients of NYHA class IV, listed for heart transplantation or a ventricular assist device (VAD), who had conventional IABP placed. Heart function prior to and after IABP insertion as well as hemodynamics, end-organ function (renal and hepatic), frequency of complications and clinical outcomes were assessed. The duration of intra-aortic balloon pump insertion ranged from 72 to 360 h (mean 181.54+/-81.65). After 48 h of intra-aortic balloon pump support, there was a significant increase of mean systemic arterial pressure from 74.5+/-9.6 to 82.3+/-4.7 mmHg (P=0.02), and ejection fraction from 14.7+/-6.4 to 21.0+/-8.6 (P=0.014). Meanwhile improvement of cardiac index, pulmonary wedge pressure and end-organ perfusion markers did not reach statistical significance. Three patients were successfully weaned off the balloon and recovered without additional interventions, two patients were transplanted and three were supported with counterpulsation until the implantation of assist device. Three patients died due to progressive heart failure, two after IABP removal and one after VAD implantation. There was no incidence of infection, limb ischemia, thrombus, or embolic complications. Our data showed that intra-aortic balloon pump support may be successfully and safely used in the acute decompensated dilated cardiomyopathy patients, as an urgent measure of cardiac support, to stabilize the patient and maintain organ perfusion until transplant is available, VAD is placed or patient is weaned from IABP."

    "abstract": "Acute lower limb ischemia is not infrequently associated with limb loss 10-30%) or death of the affected patient (15-30%). Thus, acute lower limb ischemia is an emergency. There are two categories of acute arterial occlusion: embolism (70-80%) and thrombosis (20-30%). Early diagnosis is a prerequisite for optimal management. Initial clinical examination is the crucial point: it makes the diagnosis of acute ischemia, localizes the level of occlusion, collects etiologic information and allows for assessing the local and general impact of ischemia on the patient. If sensation and motor function are present, viability of the limb is not threatened (incomplete limb ischemia), and good results can be obtained by utilizing anticoagulation and delayed elective revascularization, if the latter is indicated. If the patient, however, presents symptoms of a complete limb ischemia (paralysis or anesthesia is present), then ultimate limb loss is likely. Most patients present with subtle findings and lack classic symptoms, which makes the diagnosis difficult. The standard office-based tests to determine the presence of acute peripheral vascular disease are calculation of the ankle-brachial index and color duplex sonography. Up to now, digital subtraction angiography is used as standard of reference for definitive localization of the occlusion before revascularization. Magnetic resonance arteriography may be helpful when symptoms or findings do not correlate with the noninvasive ultrasound methods. Therapeutic choices are high-dose heparin therapy, surgical removal of the clot, mechanical interventional thrombectomy, and/or catheter-directed thrombolysis - the ultimate choice being dependent on the particular status of the patient. Patients with severe ischemia require immediate surgical intervention. In patients with contraindications to surgical management or incomplete ischemia, interventional revascularization is the therapy of primary choice. Successful outcome is dependent on careful clinical assessment and a prompt multidisciplinary approach to revascularization."

    "abstract": "Acutely ischemic limbs are often of uncertain viability. To assist operative management, this study determined prospectively which indicators on admission were the best predictors of major amputation and, conversely, limb preservation. Data were collected on admission. Presenting complaint, history, clinical assessment, and blood test results, including creatine kinase (CK), were recorded. Surgical procedures were noted-in particular, the presence or absence of major amputation by death or discharge. The setting was a tertiary vascular referral center in a university teaching hospital. Subjects included all patients referred as emergency cases to the vascular unit over an 18-month period who were admitted for inpatient management with acute lower limb ischemia. The main outcome measure was major amputation. A total of 97 patients with acute ischemia were studied prospectively (51 men and 46 women). Twenty-one patients (21.6%) underwent major amputation. Previous vascular surgery (P = .012), mottling (P = .001), sensory loss (P = .003), motor loss (P = .001), muscle tenderness (P < .001), absent ankle Doppler signals (P = .008), neutrophilia (P = .011), and increased CK (P < .001) were significantly associated with major amputation. If CK was normal, the risk of major amputation was 4.6% (95% confidence interval, 0.0%-9.7%). If CK was increased, the risk was 56.2% (95% CI, 39.1%-73.4%). Specific clinical findings were significantly associated with major amputation. Of these, only CK had a positive predictive value greater than 50%. Plasma CK can assist operative management of acute lower limb ischemia by quantifying prospectively the risk of major amputation or limb preservation on admission."

From 1990 to 2005, six patients suffering subacute limb ischemia, secondary to thrombosis of a popliteal artery aneurysm, benefited selective intra-arterial fibrinolysis, followed by subsequent aneurysm exclusion and bypass grafting. This represents ten percent of all popliteal aneurysms operated on in that time period and 28% of all thrombosed popliteal artery aneurysms. The lytic procedure was successful in all cases, restituting patency in two (n = 3), one (n = 2) or all (n = 1) crural arteries. The venous bypass graft remained patent in all but one patient. In one patient, the graft occluded at 10 months without limb loss. This outcome compares more favorable than the result obtained with emergent surgery alone for thrombosed popliteal artery aneurysms with profound limb ischemia (eight patients, of whom one required amputation at day 5 and one lost his limb at nine months following graft thrombosis). Preoperative intra-arterial lytic therapy, in the setting of subacute limb ischemia caused by thrombosis of a popliteal artery aneurysm, can be considered as safe and effective."

The Finnvasc registry included data on 3,925 infrainguinal surgical revascularization procedures. This database was randomly divided into a derivation and a validation data set of similar sizes. In the overall series, 30-day postoperative mortality and major amputation rates were 3.1% and 6.3%, respectively. The 30-day postoperative mortality and/or limb-loss rate was 9.2%. Diabetes, coronary artery disease, foot gangrene, and urgent operation were independent predictors of 30-day postoperative mortality and/or major lower-limb amputation.

Patients with severe acute limb ischemia (Rutherford category IIb) need emergent revascularization. CDT should be considered, nonetheless, if the relative risks compared with primary operation are favorable. CDT is a life- and limb-saving treatment for many patients despite limitations of efficacy and associated complications.

This multicenter trial was sponsored by the Cooperative Studies Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Of the 510 patients enrolled in the CARP trial and randomized to coronary revascularization or no revascularization before elective vascular surgery, 143 had CLI and 164 had IC as an indication for lower limb revascularization; >95% of each group were men. The presence of coronary artery disease was determined by cardiac catheterization. Eligible patients had at least one treatable coronary lesion of > or =70%. Those with significant left main disease, ejection fraction of <20%, and aortic stenosis were excluded. Patients were randomized to coronary artery disease revascularization or no revascularization before vascular surgery and followed for mortality and morbidity perioperatively and for a median of 2.7 years postoperatively. Medical treatment of coronary artery disease was pursued aggressively. Patients with IC had a longer time from randomization to vascular surgery (p = .001) and more abdominal operations (p < .001). Patients with CLI had more urgent operations (p = .006), reoperations (p < .001), and limb loss (p = .008) as well as longer hospital stays (p < .001). The IC group had more perioperative myocardial infarctions (CLI, 8.4%; IC, 17.1%; p = .024), although perioperative mortality was similar (CLI, 3.5%; IC, 1.8%; p = .360). In follow-up, the IC group also had numerically more myocardial infarctions (CLI, 16.8%; IC, 25%; p = .079), but mortality was not different (CLI, 21%; IC, 22%; p = .825). Coronary artery revascularization did not lower perioperative or long-term mortality in either group. Our data indicate that patients with significant coronary artery disease and either CLI or IC can undergo vascular surgery with low mortality and morbidity, and these results are not improved by coronary artery revascularization before vascular surgery. Furthermore, when selected for the presence of symptomatically stable, severe coronary artery disease, there is no difference in long-term survival between patients with CLI and IC. Finally, the better-than-predicted outcomes for these patients with advanced systemic atherosclerosis may be due to aggressive medical management with beta-blockers, statins, and acetylsalicylic acid."

Complications are reported as prolapse, retraction, and paracolostomal abscess. However, complication with an ischemic distal limb has not been reported. We report a case of critical intra-abdominal disease after decompressed colostomy for relieving malignant sigmoid colon obstruction; a potential fatal condition should be alerted. A 76-year-old male visited our emergency department for symptoms related to obstructed sigmoid colon tumor with foul-odor vomitus containing fecal-like materials. An emergent blow-hole colostomy proximal to an obstructed sigmoid lesion was created, and resolution of complete colon obstruction was pursued. Unfortunately, extensive abdominal painful distention with board-like abdomen and sudden onset of high fever with leukocytopenia developed subsequently. Such surgical abdomen rendered a secondary laparotomy with resection of the sigmoid tumor along with an ischemic colon segment located proximally up to the previously created colostomy. Eventually, the patient had an uneventful postoperative hospital stay. In the present article, we have described an emergent condition of sudden onset of distal limb ischemia after blow-hole colostomy and concluded that despite the decompressed colostomy would resolve acute malignant colon obstruction efficiently; impending ischemic bowel may progress with a possible irreversible peritonitis. Any patient, who undergoes a decompressed colostomy without resection of the obstructed lesion, should be monitored with leukocyte count and abdominal condition survey frequently."

Since contrast angiography may miss the diagnosis, the authors suspect that thrombosis of PAA may be an underappreciated cause of acute ischemia. Routine use of duplex arteriography (DA) may aid in the diagnosis and may help identify the outflow vessels with improved results. One hundred and nine patients (group 1) from 1994 to 1997 and 201 patients from 1998 to 2001 (group 2) presenting with acute limb-threatening ischemia were studied. None of the group 1 patients underwent preoperative DA and no diagnosis of acute popliteal artery aneurysm thrombosis was made. Ten patients with acute ischemia due to thrombosed popliteal artery aneurysms were identified in group 2 when preoperative DA was routinely performed. Urgent revascularization based on the results from DA was performed with use of autogenous saphenous vein in all patients. Six patients had functioning bypasses with a mean follow-up of 15.6 months. There were 3 deaths, 2 within 30 days and 1 after 2(1/2) years with functioning grafts. One patient was lost to follow-up. No major amputations were performed. Incidence of thrombosed popliteal artery aneurysms as the cause of acute limb-threatening ischemia is probably underestimated. Routine use of DA may provide the diagnosis and identifies the available outflow vessels. Contrary to previously published reports, urgent revascularization of an acutely ischemic extremity from thrombosed popliteal aneurysm can provide excellent rates of limb salvage."

On admission, 9 (22.5%) had cardiogenic shock/hypotension, 20 (50%) cardiac tamponade, 14 (35%) kidney failure, 11 (27.5%) limb ischemia, 3 (7.5%) neurologic deficit, and 1 (2.5%) myocardial ischemia. Surgical procedures included isolated replacement of the ascending aorta in 34 patients (85%), associated with total root replacement in 5 (12.5%), and with aortic valve replacement in 1 (2.5%). Eleven patients (27.5%) underwent aortic arch replacement (hemiarch: n=8, 20%; total arch: n=3, 7.5%). In-hospital mortality was 30% (12 patients). Mortality tended to be higher (8/21, 38% vs 4/19, 21%; p=NS) for patients presenting with any one of the following complications: tamponade, shock, brain and/or myocardial, renal, limb malperfusion. Actuarial survival at 1, 5, and 7 years was 93+/-5%, 80+/-8%, and 80+/-8%, respectively, and freedom from reoperation 97+/-2%, 97+/-2%, and 97+/-2%, respectively.

Seventy-four percent of survivors are in NYHA FC I, and quality of life test (RAND SF-36) revealed a generalized perception of independency and well-being, comparable to an age-matched population. Overall results for emergency repair of acute type A aortic dissection in the elderly justify intervention, particularly in uncomplicated cases. Expeditious referral and intervention by lowering pre-operative dissection-related complications and comorbidities might help to improve results.

    "abstract": "The most common anticoagulant used for cardiopumonary bypass is heparin. An alternate form of anticoagulant therapy is needed for patients who have immune-mediated heparin-associated thrombocytopenia (HIT). Thrombocytopenia causes bleeding and may lead to serious arterial and venous thrombosis. HIT or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis type II (HITT) are both described as adverse reactions to heparin. They are diagnosed with a platelet count less than a 100,000/mcl for 2 consecutive days. HITT, the severe form, is characterized with the thrombocytopenia in combination with thromboembolic complications, such as strokes, myocardial infarctions, and limb ischemia. Two cases are presented in which r-hirudin was used for anticoagulation for aortocoronary bypass surgery and mitral valve replacement. The activated partial prothrombin time (aPTT) was used to monitor coagulation. In the first case, the aPTT was maintained greater than 100 seconds, and at the termination of cardiopulmonary bypass, some clot was noted in the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. In the second case, a longer cardiopulmonary bypass run was anticipated, the hirudin bolus and infusion rate were increased, and the aPTT was maintained at greater than 200 sec. Adequate coagulation resulted, and, at the end of bypass, no clot was noted. These case studies seem to suggest a higher dosage of r-hirudin may be required for the use of cardiopulmonary bypass and a need to maintain aPTT values greater than 200 sec to help monitor anticoagulation."

    "abstract": "Interventional radiologists, cardiologists, and vascular surgeons are capable of performing endovascular procedures successfully in their respective environments. Suboptimal anatomy or intraoperative technical problems can be encountered, and endovascular management alone is not always suitable. The objectives of this study were to define the incidence of adjunctive surgical techniques, to discuss the rationale for endovascular reconstruction in a well-developed surgical environment, and to assess the effect of experience on the incidence of adjunctive repair. All primary aortic and aortoiliac elective, urgent, and emergent endovascular procedures performed at the Peter Lougheed Center and entered into a prospective database from May 25, 1999 to June 01, 2005, were reviewed. All adjunctive surgical techniques to enable stent deployment, enhance attachment site, or solve intraoperative difficulties were captured. The study period was divided into two time periods based on learning curve data to assess the effect of experience on the rate of adjunctive repairs. Four hundred thirty-eight patients underwent elective (80%), urgent (15%), or emergent (5%) endovascular procedures during the study period. These consisted of 101 thoracic and 337 abdominal operations, including the use of 13 fenestrated stents. One hundred thirty-nine patients (31.7%) required 180 open surgical procedures. Complete data were available for the entire patient cohort. The mean follow-up was 793.2 days (SD, 519.1 days). Procedures were necessary for vascular access, arterial dissection/rupture, limb ischemia, and enhancement/elongation of the stent attachment site. The persistent endoleak rate was 5.3%, the late rupture rate was 0.7%, the conversion rate was 1.6%, the 30-day surgical mortality rate was 3.2%, all-cause mortality to date is 7.3%, and the reintervention rate was 4.6%. There was no statistically significant effect of the learning curve on the incidence of surgical adjunctive procedures in either the thoracic group (11/26 [42.3%] for phase 1 vs 17/75 [22.6%] for phase 2) or the abdominal group (14/50 [28.0%] for phase 1 vs 97/287 [33.8%] for phase 2). Overall, 31.5% of patients required adjunctive surgical repair. Successful endografting requires endovascular expertise in addition to a well-developed surgical environment to increase applicability and decrease patient risk. Despite advances in endovascular technology, hybrid techniques will continue to be required to achieve good overall success rates."

    "abstract": "Nowadays acute limb ischemia (ALI) is still a tremendous complication that may compromise local or general prognosis. Every practician might be able to diagnose this situation in order to transfer in emergency the patient in a vascular unit. The main determinants of outcome of the leg are the severity of the ALI and a prompt treatment. The severity is evaluated according the SCV/ISCVS classification. Patients with a sensitive-motor neurologic deficit are at high risk; they require urgent therapy. The main causes are embolism and thrombosis. In case of classical presentation of embolism, immediate embolectomy will be done under local anesthetic. But this presentation is rare; often the picture is much more complex; the majority of ALI patients are elderly with atherosclerotic vessels. In such situation a team approach is mandatory to decide optimal management. The treatment may combine thrombolytic therapy or aspiration thrombectomy and percutaneous or surgical revascularisation. Finally, atrial fibrillation is now the most common cause of embolism, and appropriate anticoagulation would prevent this complication."

    "abstract": "Although heparin/protamine has been the standard anticoagulation regimen in cardiac surgery for decades, it induces negative reactions within the vasculature. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a highly prothrombotic immune reaction to heparin that may result in death, limb ischemia leading to amputation, graft occlusion, and other severe thrombotic events. Patients undergoing cardiac surgery are at high risk for HIT antibody seroconversion and at risk for clinical HIT. For patients with acute or subacute HIT and needing urgent cardiac surgery, accepted protocols for alternative, non-heparin anticoagulation are needed. The direct thrombin inhibitor bivalirudin offers promise in this area and is currently being evaluated in multicenter trials as an alternative for heparin/protamine in patients with HIT undergoing cardiac surgery."

Diagnosis is mainly based on clinical data. Complementary investigations have a limited place, and should not unnecessarily delay the treatment. There are two categories of acute arterial, non-traumatic occlusion: embolism and thrombosis of an atherosclerotic vessel. The distinction between these two entities is not always evident, since ischemia can be the consequence of an arterial embolism in a diseased atherosclerotic artery. We discuss the clinical aspects and the causes of acute lower limb ischemia. The prognosis, outcome and therapeutic management are determined by the cause of the acute arterial obliteration."

    "abstract": "Ischemic preconditioning (IP) is defined as a brief period of ischemia (\"preclamping\") followed by tissue reperfusion, thereby increasing ischemic tolerance for a subsequent longer ischemic period. Several studies showed the effectiveness of classic local IP by preclamping the flap pedicle. There are two temporally and mechanically different types of IP: acute preconditioning, which is induced by preclamping the flap pedicle briefly before flap ischemia, and late preconditioning, induced by a preclamping procedure 24-48 h before flap ischemia. However, both types of local ischemic preconditioning are rarely used clinically, most likely since they can be applied only by invasive means, significantly increase operation time, or even require a second surgical procedure. Several studies from our laboratory showed, in different experimental models, that acute IP, enhancement of flap survival, and improvement of reperfusion microcirculation can be achieved not only by preclamping the flap pedicle, but also by induction of an ischemia/reperfusion event in a body area distant from the flap prior to elevation. This new acute remote IP procedure can be applied without invasive means, using limb tourniquet ischemia briefly before flap ischemia. The effectiveness of acute remote IP was confirmed by other authors in large animal models. Another of our studies showed that late remote IP using a limb tourniquet 24 h before flap ischemia attenuates ischemia/reperfusion in muscle flaps, whereas it was ineffective in adipocutaneous flaps. The exact mechanism of \"classic\" as well as remote IP is not yet finally determined, although several studies demonstrated that endogenous nitric oxide plays an important role. In summary, the use of a tourniquet to induce limb ischemia before flap ischemia could provide a new, alternative, noninvasive remote IP protocol, although late remote IP might be effective only in muscle flaps. However, the possible future clinical application for late IP is elective flap surgery, whereas acute remote IP could even be used in emergency flaps."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischaemia (ALI) is a serious medical emergency leading to high rate of complications, being not only limb- but even life-threatening, often in spite of early successful revascularization. Concomitant underlying diseases, the metabolic derangement that seems a result of the acute insult and a possible reperfusion injury following revascularization may account for this severe prognosis. Only anticoagulation, fasciotomy and perioperative supportive treatment are established strategies in ALI patients. Possible benefit from chronic therapies active on vascular and cardiac side has been suggested. Moreover, several categories of compounds, potentially acting on pathophysiological mechanisms of ischemia-reperfusion syndrome, have been tested in experimental models, but none of them has as yet been proven effective in clinical studies. Prostanoids are drugs traditionally utilized in critical chronic limb ischaemia, and their pharmacological properties support a potential usefulness as adjuvant treatment in ALI. In a pilot double-blind placebo-controlled study it has been evaluated the effect of perioperative iloprost, a synthetic prostacyclin analogue, in 30 patients with ALI undergoing Fogarty's thromboembolectomy. The encouraging results of iloprost in this study (lower incidence of major clinical events, more evident metabolic improvement by means of transcutaneous tensiometry--statistically significant reduction in TcpCO2--suggested the opportunity of performing a larger, multicenter trial (ILAILL). In comparison with the pilot study, ILAILL included patients undergoing various types of surgical revascularization, and a longer period of experimental treatment and post-operative follow-up. Preliminary data from this study confirm the high morbidity and mortality of ALI (overall incidence of major events, 29%). Results of ILAILL trial, as for comparison of effects between iloprost and control group, will be available at the beginning of 2005."

    "abstract": "We present our experience with surgical treatment of arterial complications in Behcet disease (vasculo-Behcet disease), and the long-term results and pitfalls of surgical treatment. Between January 1990 and January 2003, 20 consecutive patients underwent surgery to treat vasculo-Behcet disease. Most patients (17 of 20) were men, with mean age of 38.4 years. Thirty-four operations were performed in 20 patients. The operative mortality rate was 5.8% (2 patients). There were 17 emergency operations, 6 because of ruptured primary abdominal aneurysms. There were five others with critical limb ischemia, resulting in 3 amputations. All patients were followed up postoperatively on average for 44 months (range, 6 months-14 years). Two additional patients were lost to follow-up. After the initial operation 10-year survival rate was 30%, 10-year complication-free survival rate was 13%, and 5-year repeat operation-free survival rate was 26%. Although surgical intervention should be postponed until active inflammation has subsided, often this is not possible, because of the emergent nature of these problems. Most arterial complications of vasculo-Behcet disease present with a pseudoaneurysm rupture or with impending rupture. An aggressive surgical approach can be life-saving in such instances, and should be undertaken regardless of long-term complications, which are more common when the operation is performed in the presence of active inflammation. Early and late results can be improved by individualizing, selecting a disease-free area for reconstruction, and eliminating use of autologous graft material."

Of these, 20 patients presented with arterial embolism of the peripheral arteries of varying standing (from in-hospital episodes of embolism to 8 months). Embolism of the cerebral arteries was identified in 8 (3.0%) patients with IE. In 5 patients, an embolus was located in the orifice of the internal carotid artery. Three persons were diagnosed to have embolism of the intracranial arteries. Thromboembolism of the limb arteries was present in 12 (4.5%) cases. Active IE was diagnosed in 11 patients; in 9 cases, IE was in a stage of remission, Bivalvular mitralaortic disease was present in 4 patients; aortic disease was identified in 9 and mitral disease in 7 patients. In 3 patients with acute disorders of cerebral circulation arising from embolism of the carotid arteries and in 3 patients with progressive acute limb ischemia due to embolism of lower limb arteries, the operations were performed on an emergency basis. In these cases, two stage operations were undertaken. Five patients presenting with infective aneurysms of lower limb arteries and thromboembolism of the peripheral arteries with chronic lower limb artery ischemia underwent one stage operations. The first stage of operation consisted in resection of the infected vascular segment and an aneurysm, the second stage in correction of valvular heart disease. The outcomes of operations were regarded as satisfactory in all the cases. No complications or lethal outcomes were recorded in the postoperative period."

A national vascular registry (Finnvasc)-based survey included 5709 operations for CLI from 1991 through 1999. Of these operations, 2508 (44%) were performed on diabetics. Tissue loss was the indication for surgery in 77% of diabetics and in 52% of nondiabetics. The proportion of femorodistal bypasses was 43% in diabetics and 24% in nondiabetics, whereas the proportion of reconstructions for aortofemoral arterial occlusive disease was 16% in diabetics and 34% in nondiabetics. Thirty-day mortality was 4.5% in diabetics and 3.4% in nondiabetics ( P = .05). The rate for early below-knee amputation was 6.5% in diabetics and 3.3% in nondiabetics ( P < .001). Independent factors for postoperative death were aortofemoral reconstruction (odds ratio [OR], 4.0), preoperative cardiac risk factor (OR, 3.1), primary surgery (OR, 2.0), renal insufficiency (OR, 1.9), urgent surgery (OR, 1.7), and age (OR, 1.3). Diabetes was an independent risk factor for postoperative below-knee amputation (OR, 1.7), cardiac complications (OR, 1.5), and superficial wound infection (OR, 1.3). There was an inverse association between diabetes and acute graft occlusion (OR, 0.8). Independent risk factors for early postoperative mortality in diabetes were aortofemoral reconstruction (OR, 2.5), urgent surgery (OR, 2.0), male gender (OR, 2.0), renal insufficiency (OR, 1.9), cardiac risk factor (OR, 1.7), and age (OR, 1.4). In nondiabetics independent risk factors for early postoperative mortality were aortofemoral reconstruction (OR, 4.5), cardiac risk factor (OR, 3.6), primary surgery (OR, 2.6), and extra-anatomic bypass (OR, 2.3). Diabetes was not an independent risk factor for early postoperative mortality in CLI as there was an increased morbidity in diabetics associated with old age, male gender, known coronary artery disease, and renal insufficiency, as well as urgent surgery. As diabetics have increased proclivity for these factors, special attention needs to be paid to their preoperative assessments."

The objective of this paper is to present our experience with the incidence, presentation, and management of such complications. Over 9 years 311 patients with aortic aneurysms underwent EVAR. A retrospective review identified 28 patients (9.0%) with ischemic complications. Among 28 patients with ischemic complications, 21 had lower extremity ischemia and 7 had pelvic ischemia: colon (n = 4), buttock (n = 2), and spinal cord (n = 2). Of the 21 patients with lower extremity ischemia, 15 had limb occlusions (71.4%), 3 due to embolization (14.7%) and 3 the result of common femoral artery thromboses (14.7%). Limb occlusions were manifested as severe acute arterial ischemia (n = 6), rest pain (n = 3), intermittent claudication (n = 5), and decreased femoral pulse (n = 1). Limb occlusions were managed with thrombectomy and stent placement (n = 4), femorofemoral bypass (n = 7), eventual explantation because of persistent endoleak (n = 1), and expectant management (n = 3). The 3 patients with occlusions managed expectantly all had intermittent claudication, which has subsequently improved. In the 6 patients with lower extremity ischemia due to embolization or common femoral artery injury presentation was acute, and embolectomy was performed, followed by femoral artery endarterectomy and patch angioplasty or placement of an interposition graft. One patient who had a prolonged postoperative course including cardiac arrest subsequently required distal bypass and ultimately above- knee amputation. Among the 7 patients with pelvic ischemia, 2 patients had unilateral hypogastric artery embolization before the original surgery. Among the patients with colonic ischemia, 3 were seen immediately postoperatively, and required colectomy and colostomy. Two patients who required urgent colectomy subsequently had multiple organ failure, and died in the perioperative period. One patient had abdominal pain 1 week after surgery, which was managed with bowel rest, with subsequent improvement. In 2 patients spinal cord ischemia developed immediately after surgery, which resulted in persistent paraplegia. Buttock ischemia developed in 2 patients, 1 of whom required fasciotomy because of gluteal compartment syndrome, and had transient renal failure. Ischemic complications are not uncommon after EVAR, and may exceed the incidence with open surgical repair. Limb ischemia is most often a result of limb occlusion, and can be successfully managed with standard interventions. Pelvic ischemia often results from atheroembolization despite preservation of hypogastric arterial circulation. Colonic and spinal ischemia are associated with the highest morbidity and mortality."

A retrospective analysis of a prospectively recorded vascular surgery database from June 1992 to December 2002 was performed with chart review. Main outcome measures Patient survival, limb salvage, and graft patency were evaluated. Fifty-one popliteal artery aneurysms were repaired in 39 patients, all male and ranging in age from 18 to 87 years (mean 67.1). Mean follow-up was 47.8 months. Repair was elective in 37 (72.5%) and emergent in 14 (27.5%) limbs, 13 with acute ischemia and one with aneurysm rupture. Thrombolytic therapy was utilized in four ischemic limbs with no suitable bypass target vessel identified on initial arteriogram. Outflow vessels included the popliteal artery in 22 (43.1%) and infrapopliteal vessels in 29 (56.9%) limbs. Cardiac morbidity and 30-day mortality rates were 0%. Overall primary patency, secondary patency, limb salvage, and actuarial survival were 95.6%, 100%, 98.0%, and 98.0% at 1 year and 85.1%, 96.9%, 98.0%, and 83.8% at 5 years, respectively. Bypass graft redo or revision was performed for stenosis in one and occlusion in four limbs. Two amputations were performed at 6 days and 63.6 months after initial aneurysm repair. No difference was noted between elective and emergent groups with regard to patency, limb salvage, or survival (P >.26), and no association between the number of identified target vessels and limb salvage or patency was demonstrated (P =.12). In our experience, the outcome of the popliteal artery aneurysm repair was comparable in the emergent and elective settings. Aggressive tibial reconstruction plays a crucial role in the treatment of popliteal artery aneurysms, especially in those presenting with acute limb ischemia. Thrombolytic therapy is infrequently required in the acute setting, although it may be useful in patients with no identifiable outflow target vessel on initial arteriogram."

    "abstract": "The presence of peripheral vascular disease, in particular iliofemoral disease, is responsible in part for vascular complications from femoral artery cannulation. We investigated whether prescreening for vascular obstructions with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in high-risk patients with peripheral vascular disease (PVD) would provide useful information to angiographers seeking to improve the safety and efficiency of femoral artery access at cardiac catheterization. Twelve consecutive patients with known or suspected PVD underwent contrast-enhanced, aorto-iliofemoral MRA using a real-time BolusTrak technique. Contrast-to-noise ratios for each patient were calculated. The cardiac angiographer reviewed the MRA prior to catheterization and selected an access site. The patients' subsequent clinical course was evaluated, and a postprocedure questionnaire was completed by the angiographer to define the value of the prescreening MRA. No significant vascular complications occurred in these patients as defined by failure of initially chosen access site, arterial dissection, limb ischemia, pseudoaneurysm formation, hemorrhage (including retroperitoneal hematoma), or need for blood transfusion or emergency vascular surgical repair. Statistical frequency analysis of the responses in the postprocedure questionnaire demonstrated that the MR data were clinically valuable in (1) influencing the initial choice of access site; (2) influencing technical alterations to the standard access; and, (3) enhancing confidence in the selection of access site. MRA prescreening in patients with PVD is an effective, novel adjunct to cardiac catheterization in selected patients that improves physician confidence and influences technical choices during coronary angiography from the femoral artery approach."

Factors in this progress encompass rapid noninvasive diagnosis, intraoperative introduction of aprotinine, surgical glue, sealed grafts, and refined surgical technique. The objective of this study is to identify which factors contributed to the improvement of the surgical outcome of acute type A dissections. Between January 1989 and February 2001, 78 consecutive patients had emergency surgeries for acute type A dissection. The initial 31 patients (group I) received preoperative angiography, when possible. Since 1996, the next 47 patients (group II) have received noninvasive rapid diagnosis with hemostatic surgical management. This included aggressive proximal resection and judicious use of gelatin resorcine formol glue and felt strips. Between the two groups, in-hospital mortality and morbidity, incidence of neurological complications, late survival and cardiovascular events were compared. Risk factors for in-hospital death were investigated with univariate and multivariate analysis. The in-hospital mortality was significantly improved in group II (4.3%) compared with group I (29.0%). Overall mortality was 14.1%. Multivariate analysis revealed preoperative limb ischemia and delayed timing of operation (> 3 hours after arrival) as independent risk factors for in-hospital death. Late survival at 5 years was 61.5+/-7.5%. Between the two groups there was no significant difference in late survival or cardiovascular events. Immediate surgical intervention, using rapid noninvasive diagnosis with hemostatic management, substantially improves the surgical outcome of acute aortic dissection."

Echocardiography was confirmatory in the diagnosis of all the benign tumors, whereas the malignant tumors were incidentally found during surgery. All the patients survived the operation. Complete resection of the tumor was possible only in benign tumors; however, malignant tumors were partly removed to relieve obstruction. All the excised benign tumors showed no recurrence on a mean follow-up of 54.78 +/- 31.30 months (range 3-108 months). Myxoma was found in 31 patients, left ventricular fibroma in 1, and leiomyosarcoma in 2. Both the patients with malignant tumors developed recurrence postoperatively, and succumbed to extensive distant metastases.

The subclavian artery was also dissected, with only minimal flow in the left mammary artery. The visceral and renal vessels originated from the false lumen and were not perfused. Emergent stent-graft placement was undertaken to close the entry tear and re-establish perfusion of the lower extremity as well as visceral and renal organs. Additional stent-grafts were placed in the dissected left subclavian artery to perfuse the left internal mammary bypass and in the inferior mesenteric artery, which arose from the false lumen. Six months after operation, the patient is well. Acute iatrogenic aortic dissection secondary to endoscopic CAB surgery can be treated emergently to restore distal perfusion to vital organs."

Unfractionated heparin as a single shot is immediately given followed by continuous infusion when diagnosis is clinically evident and contraindications are excluded. Thromboembolectomy using a Fogarty catheter is immediately performed in patients with evidence of arterial embolization and signs of advanced ischemia (TASC IIb/III) followed by intraoperative angiography. Patients with evidence of arterial thrombosis require urgent angiography followed by thrombectomy and probably subsequent endovascular or surgical interventions and vascular reconstruction. For patients with moderate ischemia (TASC IIa), initial diagnostic angiography is recommended followed by primary thrombectomy with subsequent intraoperative angiography and immediate endovascular or operative treatment of remaining vascular problems. As an alternative therapeutic option initial catheter-guided local thrombolysis can be performed in selected patients with the intention of subsequent limb revascularization or unmasking relevant vessel alterations leading to specific endovascular or surgically performed vascular reconstruction. Possible development of muscle ischemia because of increased compartment pressure should be considered and fasciotomy performed when indicated. Primary amputation of the severely ischemic limb after initial thrombectomy might be recommended in patients with life-threatening organ failure related to muscle necrosis."

The mortality rate with conservative medical management is approximately 75%, whereas it ranges from 18% to 37% with surgical treatment. At our institution, 7 of the 87 patients admitted because of blunt aortic trauma, between January 1995 and January 2002, had abdominal aortic dissection. Four patients were treated using endovascular techniques by percutaneous stent placement. The indications for endovascular management were lower limb ischemia in one case and extension of the dissection in two; one patient was asymptomatic. Aortic dissection was complicated by ischemic paraplegia in two patients, and both were treated by conventional operative repair. One patient was managed medically because of a minimal intimal disruption. No deaths were related to the aortic dissection or its treatment. Angiographic and computed tomographic (CT) studies showed thrombosis of the false lumen and complete obliteration of the dissection in the endovascular group. The neurologic condition of the two paraplegic patients either cleared completely or partially improved. In the absence of ischemic paraplegia or other injuries that require emergency surgery, endovascular treatment is a safe and efficient method for treating traumatic infrarenal aortic dissection."

    "title": "Surgery of popliteal artery aneurysms: a 12-year experience.",
    "abstract": "Management of asymptomatic popliteal aneurysm is controversial, and the prognosis for acutely thrombosed aneurysm is notoriously poor. We evaluated the management and outcome for popliteal aneurysm. A retrospective review of all patients with popliteal aneurysm between 1988 and 2000 was carried out. Fifty-two limbs were operated on in 41 patients. Data collected included findings at presentation, operative details, graft patency, limb salvage, complications, and 30-day mortality. Initial findings included acute ischemia (n = 14), no symptoms (n = 29), acute rupture (n = 2), chronic ischemia (n = 5), and symptoms of nerve or vein compressive (n = 2). All patients with symptomatic aneurysms and 22 patients with asymptomatic aneurysms (21 larger than 2 cm in diameter, 1 with thrombus at duplex ultrasound scanning) underwent surgery as first-line treatment. Of the 7 patients with asymptomatic aneurysm managed with surveillance with duplex ultrasound scanning, acute ischemia developed in three, 1 aneurysm ruptured, compressive symptoms developed in 1, and 2 remained asymptomatic but required surgery because of aneurysm enlargement (>2 cm). Of the 17 patients with acute ischemia, 13 had neurologic signs and underwent immediate thromboembolectomy (trifurcation alone in 8, ankle-level arteriotomy in 4) and bypass grafting (n = 12) or inlay grafting (n = 1), and the other 4 underwent intra-arterial thrombolysis initially. Of these 4 procedures, 2 were successful and had elective surgery; the other 2 required urgent surgery because of secondary distal embolism and failure of recanalization. Thirteen of the 17 grafts were to the crural vessels. Bypass grafting (medial approach) was used in 16 of the 17 patients with acute ischemia, all 5 patients with chronic ischemia, and the 8 patients with no symptoms. An inlay technique (posterior approach) was used in 16 patients with no symptoms, the 3 patients with symptoms of nerve or vein compression, and 1 patient with acute ischemia. The distal anastomoses were to the below-knee popliteal artery in 35 patients and the crural arteries in 15 patients, using autologous vein. Two of the patients with rupture underwent ligation alone, the other undergoing bypass grafting in addition. The overall 5-year primary patency rate was 69%, secondary patency rate was 87%, and limb salvage rate was 87%. Limb salvage was achieved in 14 of the 17 patients with acute ischemia. Patients with asymptomatic aneurysms had better secondary graft patency (100%) compared with symptomatic aneurysms (74%; P <.01). Acute ischemia, technique used, and crural artery grafts were not predictors of graft failure with either univariate or multivariate analysis. Symptomatic aneurysms were associated with more postoperative complications and greater 30-day mortality (4 of 28 vs 0 of 24). Thromboembolectomy followed by crural bypass grafting is an effective treatment for popliteal aneurysm with severe acute limb ischemia. Outcome is better with surgical management of asymptomatic popliteal aneurysm compared with symptomatic aneurysm."

    "abstract": "Good patient outcomes depend on the rapidity and completeness with which re-establishment of arterial blood flow to the limbs occurs. Patients with a greater magnitude of ischemic tissue--such as with an acute aortic occlusion--have worse outcomes than patients with a segmental artery occlusion such as a popliteal arterial thrombosis. Limb loss is high in any situation in which a delay in diagnosis occurs. It is unclear whether or not endovascular therapy will supercede traditional surgery because the etiologies of ALI are too broad to make sweeping conclusions at this time. The author and others [14,15], including those who have promulgated the use of thrombolytic therapy, have come to reasonable conclusions regarding how to deal with ALI: The diagnosis of ALI should be established rapidly. Determine its classification based on the patient's history and physical examination, and promptly institute anticoagulant therapy. Determine whether or not the patient should be taken emergently for surgical thromboembolectomy or a revascularization procedure versus arteriogram and possible thrombolysis. Adjunctive therapy such as antiplatelet agents (e.g., GIIb/IIIa antagonists) and other anticoagulant agents must be better investigated before recommendations can be made. Save life over limb. Emergent guillotine amputation is sometimes required to save a patient's life."

    "abstract": "Despite remarkable progress in both, diagnostic and therapeutic development in treating aortic dissections, this continues to be one of the most severe vascular disorders and is subject to high mortality rates. While aortic dissections of Type A can be treated surgically today, in the majority of patients with Type B dissections hypotensive treatment is the method of choice, providing a better chance of survival and the effective prevention of aneurysm formation and rupture at the site of the intimal tear. However in certain cases, Type B dissection generates either isthmic aneurysm formation, or, with distal progression, may result in long segmental thoracic, thoraco-abdominal or abdominal deterioration of the aorta and its side branches. The spinal, visceral, renal and lower limb ischemia threatens the viability of these organs and hypotensive medication may enhance this risk. Emergency diagnostic work-up and selective surgical reconstruction could lead to reduced mortality. In our department we have undertaken 33 thoracoabdominal endoaortectomies with meticulous reconstruction of renal and visceral orifices. The mortality rate in this subgroup of patients was 6%. Based on our experience with Type B aortic dissections we recommend open \"endoaortectomy\" in selected cases in order to improve the long-term outcome."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia is a vascular-surgical emergency requiring immediate referral to a hospital provided with all the necessary therapeutic facilities. Essential initial measures are protection of the limb against continued cooling, management of pain, and bolus administration of heparin. For the physician providing further care, not only an accurate history, but, ideally, also the results of earlier investigations such as ECG, abdominal US or Doppler studies, provide useful information. In patients who have not undergone prior surgery vascular-surgical management, that is, embolectomy with a balloon catheter, is the treatment of choice. Furthermore, the patient requires continuing care after discharge; here, wound management and the supervision of anticoagulation measures that might be needed are important tasks for the general practitioner."

Patients were treated for 3 to 4 weeks with intravenous infusions of the rheologic, antioxidant and endotheliumprotective flavonoid mixture 0-(beta-hydroxyethyl)-rutosides (HR) (Venoruton; Zyma, now Novartis) which improves microvascular blood perfusion and possesses antiedematous effects. The infusions were combined with oral anticoagulation (Waran) which was continued afterwards as long-term treatment for at least 2 years. In some cases anticoagulation was later replaced by low-dose aspirin. A statistically significant favorable effect was found for both limb salvage and survival--the 10 selected cases of limb salvage in spite of \"end-point ischemia\" also included 1 uremic case on hemodialysis with very severe rest pain and toe necrotization. Improved microcirculation following soon after the start of treatment was observed in all 10 cases as well as an often very rapid alleviation of rest pain and beginning healing of ischemic lesions. The follow-up showed a preservation of the threatened limb for a mean time of 7.9 years in the atherosclerotic group and, in spite of high age at start of treatment (mean age 72 years), an apparently long survival of those patients who had died, on average 7.7 years. Because side effects are rare and there is a rapid alleviation of rest pain, it may be possible to give the HR infusions safely on an ambulatory basis in the out-patient department."

A tear on the anterior surface of the vein was discovered during an emergency laparotomy, and the rent was repaired successfully. Twenty-four hours later, the leg swelling increased, and at the reexploration, the common iliac vein was found to be occluded by an organized thrombus as the result of a well-endothelialized membranous band (Cockett or May-Turner syndrome). A Palma-Dale operation (crossover saphenous bypass grafting) was performed secondarily. The swelling in the leg diminished slowly, and the patient was discharged 10 days later with an oral anticoagulant therapy and elastic stockings."

    "abstract": "A 39 year old male comes to the emergency room because of rapidly increasing pain in his left leg one hour after the injection of Flunitrazepam into a groin vessel. There is a history of drug abuse for more than 15 years. The left leg is cool and shows intense patchy cyanosis. The same skin discoloration is seen at the left lower abdomen and parts of the thigh. The leg is paretic but foot-pulses are detectable. Color-coded duplex-sonography of the left leg shows normal shaped arteries with regular flow. Regarding the veins there are post-thrombotic changes but no signs of actual thrombosis. The ECG shows sinus rythme. No source of emboli can be found by echocardiography. The laboratory tests reveal normal results except of anemia (Hb 9.6 g/dl, normocytic, normochromic). As an accidental intraarterial injection with a toxic/allergic insult to the vessel-walls has to be supposed the patient is treated besides of analgesics with systemic anticoagulation, high doses of cortisone and calcium channel-blockers. With this therapeutic regimen the leg and the left lower abdomen improve gradually except for some toes which remain cyanotic. During the first days the patient develops signs of moderate rhabdomyolysis with swelling of the leg and an increase of creatininase concentration in blood. After 12 days the left leg has normalised but the toes show further demarcation. They have to be amputated six weeks later. The accidental injection of drugs into the femoral artery may result in the clinical picture of acute limb ischemia without occlusion of the big vessels of the leg. This obviously occurs most often with benzodiazepines, especially when crushed tablets soluted in water are injected. Color-coded duplex sonography is able to show open vessels within minutes and prevents ineffective surgical interventions."

A retrospective study of 208 patients (188 men and 20 women) with a mean age of 65.6 years who survived elective or emergency open repair of an infrarenal AAA was conducted at a university referral hospital. Main outcome measures included late graft-related complications, survival free from any reintervention, survival free from any vascular reintervention, and overall survival rates. Late graft-related complications occurred in 32 patients (15.4%). A proximal para-anastomotic pseudoaneurysm developed in six patients (2.9%), and a distal pseudoaneurysm developed in 18 patients (8.7%); in seven of these cases (3.4%), it was bilateral or recurrent. A graft limb occlusion occurred in 11 patients (5.3%). These complications required 37 surgical or other invasive procedures in 27 patients (13.0%). Thirty-one vascular and/or endovascular reoperations were performed. The 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year survival free from any reintervention rates were 91.5%, 86.2%, and 72.0%, respectively. At the same intervals, the survival free from any vascular reintervention rates were 93.8%, 88.5%, and 73.9%, respectively, and the overall survival rates were 66.8%, 39.4%, and 18.0%, respectively. Complications associated with a ruptured femoral artery pseudoaneurysm, a ruptured aortic pseudoaneurysm, an aortoduodenal fistula, and the elective repair of a femoral pseudoaneurysm were the graft-related causes of death, which occurred in four patients (1.9%). Age (P <.0001) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P =.002) were shown by means of multivariate analysis to be predictive of poor survival outcome, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P =.02) and lower limb ischemia (P =.04) were shown to be associated with an increased need for vascular reinterventions to treat graft-related complications. Open repair of infrarenal AAAs can achieve satisfactory 15-year follow-up rates of survival free from reintervention for any graft-related complications, suggesting that surgery should still be considered the procedure of choice for infrarenal AAAs, at least in patients who are fit for surgery."

The surgeon is more and more forced to choose between amputation d emblée and the attempt to revascularization in very old patients and in deficient general conditions. Shall we point out some principle to address our strategy? To answer this question we reviewed retrospectively our surgical choices and the results obtained during two years, from January 1997 to December 1998 (medium follow-up 11.3 months), at the Emergency Division of the Cannizzaro Hospital of Catania. In this period 143 diabetic patients were selected by our ambulatory. Of these, nineteen had a critical lower limb ischemia and therefore were submitted to a revascularization and/or amputation. All the revascularized patients were controlled by Doppler-sonography immediately after operation and then daily, till their discharge. Controls were done at the first, third, sixth month and after one year, except for patients who complained a new objective or subjective ischemic symptomatology. The primary patency rate was 84.2% and the secondary patency rate was 89.4%. The amputation rate due to the procedure failure was 5%. The complications were three: two graft infections (10.5%) and one early thrombosis of a femoro-popliteal bypass graft, due to technical defect (5.2%). Perioperative mortality rate was 15.7%. These results, if related with those reported in the letterature about amputations, are in favour of the attempt to revascularization."

From that database, 9 patients were found to have had a TKA after an ipsilateral peripheral arterial reconstruction. One patient had had bilateral peripheral arterial reconstruction followed by bilateral TKA, and 10 TKAs were reviewed. The medical records were reviewed retrospectively with particular attention given to the type of peripheral bypass surgery performed, the bypass graft source, the timing of the bypass surgery relative to TKA, the use of a tourniquet at the time of TKA, and the occurrence of complications after TKA. Of the 10 TKAs, 2 patients had acute arterial occlusion. One patient had a tourniquet, and the other patient did not. There was not a statistical correlation between graft type, tourniquet use, timing of surgery, postoperative anticoagulation, and occurrence of arterial occlusion. There is a marked risk of acute thrombosis of an ipsilateral arterial bypass graft after TKA that cannot be eliminated by performing the TKA without a tourniquet. Careful monitoring of the vascular status of the limb is required in the early postoperative period to detect arterial compromise. Should limb ischemia be suspected, an emergent vascular surgery consultation is required, and arterial flow to the lower extremity must be re-established."

    "abstract": "This paper describes the authors' experience with the management of the abdominal aorta in patients aged over 80 years. Ten urgent procedures were performed on patients older than 80 years during a 2 year period. In 4 cases surgery was performed because of a ruptured aneurysm of the subrenal abdominal aorta, in 2 cases for active symptomatic aneurysms, in 3 cases for severe lower limb ischemia (occlusion of the iliac and femoral arteries) and in 1 case for a secondary aortoenteric fistula. The operative mortality rate was 20% (2 cases with a ruptured aneurysm). Five patients are still alive in good health conditions (one of them had been operated twice for two different diseases). Even if our findings refer to a small number of patients, although similar series on emergency operations found in the literature are not substantially larger, the results do not advise against operative treatment of the abdominal aorta in cases requiring a direct approach, even in patients over 80 years of age. If this treatment strategy is obviously adopted in emergency conditions, as with the patients we are reporting on, since the alternative to operation is usually death, it should also be carefully considered in elective circumstances, where alternative treatments such as endovascular stents did not to date obtain better results. In the elective scenario all the necessary biological and physical parameters as well as the patient's age should be taken into proper account in deciding whether to operate. This is specially true now that the average life spans of an individual is longer so that patients, who may incur serious problems if left untreated, may be offered a better quality of life."

To better define its role and the indications for its use and to evaluate its success at relieving organ or limb malperfusion, we reviewed our experience with direct fenestration of the aorta. A retrospective analysis of all consecutive aortic fenestrations performed between January 1, 1979, and December 31, 1999, was performed. Fourteen patients, 12 men and two women (mean age, 59.6 years; range, 43-81), underwent fenestration of the aorta. All patients were hypertensive and had a history of tobacco use. By Stanford classification, there were three type A and 11 type B patients. In the acute dissection group (n = 7), indications for surgery were malperfusion in six patients (leg ischemia, 4; renal ischemia, 5; bowel ischemia, 3) and intra-abdominal bleeding from rupture in two. In the chronic dissection group (n = 7), indications for surgery were abdominal aortic aneurysm in 4 patients (infrarenal, 3; pararenal, 1), thoracoabdominal aneurysm in 1, hypertension from coarctation of the thoracic aorta in 1, and aortic occlusion with disabling claudication in 1. Emergency aortic fenestration was performed in seven patients (surgically for 6 and percutaneously for 1). Fenestration level was infrarenal in four and pararenal in three. Concomitant abdominal aortic graft replacement was performed in four patients, combined with ascending aortic replacement (n = 1) and bilateral aortorenal bypasses (n = 1). In two patients, acute fenestration was performed for organ malperfusion after prior proximal aortic replacement (ascending aorta, 1; descending thoracic aorta, 1). Seven elective aortic fenestrations were performed for chronic dissection (descending thoracic aorta, 2; paravisceral aorta, 2; infrarenal aorta, 2 and pararenal aorta, 1). Concomitant aortic replacement was performed in six patients (abdominal aorta, 5; thoracoabdominal aorta, 1). Fenestration was successful at restoring flow in all 10 patients with malperfusion. Operative mortality for emergency fenestration was 43% (3/7). The three deaths that occurred were of patients with anuria or bowel ischemia, or both. There were no postoperative deaths for elective fenestration. At a mean follow-up of 5.1 years, there were no recurrences of malperfusion and no false aneurysm formations at the fenestration site. Fenestration of the aorta can effectively relieve organ or limb ischemia. Bowel ischemia and anuria are indicators of dismal prognosis and emergency fenestration in these patients carries a high mortality. Elective fenestration combined with aortic replacement can be performed safely in chronic dissection. Aortic fenestration is indicated for carefully selected patients with malperfusion and offers durable benefits."

This study compares the outcomes of failed SV and PTFE grafts with a specific emphasis on the degree of acute limb ischemia caused by graft occlusion. Over a 6-year period, 718 infrainguinal revascularization procedures were performed, of which 189 were femoropopliteal bypass grafts (SV, 108; PTFE, 81). Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery (SVS/ISCVS) standardized runoff scores were calculated from preoperative arteriograms. Clinical categories of acute limb ischemia resulting from graft occlusion were graded according to SVS/ISCVS standards (I, viable; II, threatened; III, irreversible). Primary graft patency and limb salvage rates at 48 months were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients were well matched for age, sex, and comorbidities. Chronic critical ischemia was the operative indication in most cases (SV, 82%; PTFE, 80%; P =.85). Runoff scores and preoperative ankle-brachial index measurements were similar for the two groups (SV, 6.0 +/- 2.5 [SD] and 0.51 +/- 0.29; PTFE, 5.3 +/- 2.8 and 0.45 +/- 0.20; P =.06 and P =.12). The distal anastomosis was made below the knee in 60% of SV grafts and 16% of PTFE grafts (P <.001). Grade II ischemia was more likely to occur after occlusion of PTFE grafts (78%) than after occlusion of SV grafts (21%; P =.001). Emergency revascularization after graft occlusion was required for 28% of PTFE failures but only 3% of SV graft failures (P <.001). Primary graft patency at 48 months was 58% for SV grafts and 32% for PTFE grafts (P =.008). Limb salvage was achieved in 81% of SV grafts but only 56% of PTFE grafts (P =.019). Patients undergoing femoropopliteal bypass grafting with PTFE are at greater risk of ischemic complications from graft occlusion and more frequently require emergency limb revascularization as a result of graft occlusion than patients receiving SV grafts. Graft patency and limb salvage are superior with SV in comparison with PTFE in patients undergoing femoropopliteal bypass grafting."

    "abstract": "The most common anticoagulant used for cardiopulmonary bypass is heparin. An alternate form of anticoagulant therapy is needed for patients who have immune-mediated heparin-associated thrombocytopenia (HIT). Thrombocytopenia causes bleeding and may lead to serious arterial and venous thrombosis. HIT or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis type II (HITT) are both described as adverse reactions to heparin. They are diagnosed with a platelet count less than a 100,000/mcl for 2 consecutive days. HITT, the severe form, is characterized with the thrombocytopenia in combination with thromboembolic complications, such as strokes, myocardial infarctions, and limb ischemia. Two cases are presented in which r-hirudin was used for anticoagulation for aortocoronary bypass surgery and mitral valve replacement. The activated partial prothrombin time (aPTT) was used to monitor coagulation. In the first case, the aPTT was maintained greater than 100 seconds, and at the termination of cardiopulmonary bypass, some clot was noted in the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. In the second case, a longer cardiopulmonary bypass run was anticipated, the hirudin bolus and infusion rate were increased, and the aPTT was maintained at greater than 200 sec. Adequate coagulation resulted, and, at the end of bypass, no clot was noted. These case studies seem to suggest a higher dosage of r-hirudin may be required for the use of cardiopulmonary bypass and a need to maintain aPTT values greater than 200 sec to help monitor anticoagulation."

This study was performed as a retrospective study. From 1980 to 1997, 46 patients with chronic lower limb ischemia with moderate to severe claudication as the result of isolated infrarenal disease or aortoiliac disease underwent PTA. All patients underwent angiography before and after angioplasty and Doppler ultrasound scan examination with ankle-brachial index determination. No stents were used. The technical success rate was 96% (44 of 46 cases). Thirty-eight patients (83%) immediately showed clinical, hemodynamic, and angiographic improvement. The initial success rate for patients with isolated infrarenal or bifurcation disease was 92%, whereas it was 71% for aortoiliac disease. Among the eight patients with no initial improvement, four had clinical deterioration and two required emergency surgical revascularization. There were no other complications. Fifty-six percent of the patient conditions (95% confidence interval [CI], 38% to 74%) remained clinically improved at the 5-year follow-up examination. Recurrence of symptoms was caused by femoropopliteal disease in most patients. The primary patency rate assumed with maintenance of hemodynamic improvements was 70% (95% CI, 52% to 88%) and 64% (95% CI, 44% to 84%) at 4 and 5 years of follow-up, respectively. The primary patency rate at 4 years for patients with isolated infrarenal or bifurcation disease was 83% (95% CI, 64% to 100%), whereas it was 55% for aortoiliac disease (95% CI, 30% to 80%; P =.06) The variables that were statistically predictive of patency failure were poor runoff (P =. 01) and presence of aortoiliac atherosclerotic disease (P =.04). Our results suggest that PTA is an excellent treatment for chronic arterial insufficiency of the lower extremities as the result of isolated atherosclerotic lower abdominal aortic occlusive lesions because of good long-term patency. Aortic PTA for those patients with iliac involvement or with poor runoff gives acceptable results but carries lower patency and clinical success rates."

A total of 90% of the accidents occurred when the machine was put into reverse and the limb was caught by the rotary blades; the cause of the remaining accidents was unknown. Of the 23 patients, 10 patients (43.5%) suffered posterior dislocation of the knee due to forced hyperextension. Injuries were classed in two groups as a function of their prognosis: group I consisted of osteomuscular lesions without vascular or nerve involvement (11 lower limbs, 11 patients). The mortality rate in this group was 9%, the rate of major amputation was 18%, and the prognosis was favorable in 82% of the cases. Group II corresponded to lower limb injuries with neurovascular involvement (12 lower limb injuries in 10 patients: one patient belonged to both group I and group II). Acute lower limb ischemia was constant in group II; the mortality rate was 20% (two of 10 patients), and the rate of major amputation was 41.6% (five of 12 patients; three emergency amputations and two secondary amputations). These agricultural machines can cause severe trauma, and the resulting wounds are contaminated by telluric germs in rural areas.

From 1992 through 1997, 350 patients underwent iliac artery PTA at the authors' institutions. Of this group, 88 patients (88 arteries) had one or more stents placed after PTA (140 stents in total) for residual stenosis or pressure gradient (63 patients), iliac dissection (12 patients), long-segment occlusion (10 patients), or recurrent stenosis (3 patients). Thirty patients required the placement of more than one stent. The indications for PTA in these 88 patients were claudication (48 patients) and limb-threatening ischemia (40 patients). Forty-seven patients had stents placed in the common iliac, 29 patients had stents placed in the external iliac, and 12 patients had stents placed in both. Seventy-one arteries (81%) were stenotic, and 17 (19%) were occluded before PTA. Sixty-six arteries were treated by interventional radiologists, 15 by a vascular surgeon, and 7 jointly. Criteria for success included (1) increase of at least one clinical category of chronic limb ischemia from baseline or satisfactory wound healing, (2) maintenance of an ankle/brachial index increase of more than 0.10 above the preprocedure index, and (3) residual angiographic stenosis less than 25% and, for patients with pressure gradient measurements, a residual gradient less than 10 mm Hg. Stent placement was accomplished in all 88 patients with 16 (18%) major complications. Mean follow-up was 17 months (range, 3 to 48 months). By life-table analysis, success was 75% at 1 year, 62% at 2 years, and 57% at 3 years. No cardiovascular risk factor or independent variable was statistically significant in predicting success. There was no difference in success rates for common iliac or external iliac lesions. Superficial femoral artery patency did not correlate with outcome. Although stents can eliminate residual lesions and arterial dissection, these patients are likely to require adjuvant or subsequent procedures to attain clinical success. By controlling the PTA complication and treating the emergent problem, stents may allow for subsequent elective intervention."

    "abstract": "Axillobifemoral bypass (AxBFB) is considered an inferior operation because of comparatively poor long-term results. One factor that has not been considered in the literature is whether or not the operation is performed electively or for acute ischemia (< 24 hours duration). This may be a more important predictor of poor results than previously recognized. During the last 10 years, we have performed 59 AxBFB. In Group A, 41 patients (mean age 71) underwent elective AxBFB and in Group B, 18 patients (mean age 65) had emergency AxBFB. Indications for surgery in Group A were limb-threatening ischemia (30), infected aortic graft (5), and severe claudication (6); in Group B, indications for surgery were acute limb ischemia (16), and aortoduodenal fistula (2). Primary patency (p < 0.002), limb salvage (p < 0.002), and survival (p < 0.03) were significantly better in Group A versus Group B. We conclude that an AxBFB performed electively provides satisfactory palliation of severe vascular disease in high-risk patients. The indications for operation and timing of the operation may explain the widely disparate clinical results reported in the literature."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia is an emergency which regularly requires operative treatment in departments of general surgery. In about 70% of cases there is an embolic reason for acute ischemia. In the majority of cases urgent operative desobliteration is required to guarantee limb salvage. The introduction of balloon catheters reduced the surgical trauma significantly in cases of long secondary thromboses. More complex procedures are required in patients with preexisting chronic arterial occlusive disease. The mortality of these emergency operations is still 10-20% with a limb salvage rate of 80-90%."

    "abstract": "Chronic critical limb ischemia is defined as ischemia which generally endangers the distal part of a limb. If the ischemia is unrelenting, there is a high risk that amputation will be required. These critical limbs were amputated as an initial treatment long ago. Now it becomes clear that disabling patients have very poor quality of life after major amputation, and ischemic leg produces noxious substances which circulates whole body. So that primary amputation should not be a first choice for the most of the cases. And excellent techniques or new surgical materials bring successful vascular reconstruction to critical limb ischemia. Since we have not a clear definition, European and US criterion seems to be useful for a while. Macrocirculation is represented by ankle systolic pressure and microcirculation by transcutaneous oxygen pressure as well. Its value of les than 10 mmHg means urgent critical condition. Main surgical repairs include below knee bypass using autovein or fine profundaplasty with or without PTA. Usually patients should receive general cares because of high risks."

A left intraventricular thrombus was diagnosed as the source of multiple arterial emboli, resulting in an initial cerebrovascular event and subsequent bilateral acute lower extremity ischemia requiring emergency surgery. No underlying heart disease was detected. Pathologic examination of the embolectomy specimen revealed fibrin platelet aggregates with rare white and red blood cells, consistent with a \"white thrombus.\" We conclude that routine monitoring of platelet count should be performed in all patients receiving heparin to identify promptly individuals who have heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and when thromboembolic complications occur in this setting, echocardiography is indicated to identify possible intracardiac sources for emboli, even in patients with previously known structurally intact hearts."

    "abstract": "This study used an experimental model (canine hind limb) of compartment syndrome, monitored with phosphorus 31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, to determine the pressure threshold for metabolic deterioration in skeletal muscle previously subjected to ischemia. Our results show that muscle subjected to 6 h of antecedent ischemia has a lower tolerance to increased tissue pressure than otherwise normal muscle. The threshold was found to occur at a delta P (difference between mean blood pressure and limb compartment pressure) of 40 mm Hg, compared with a delta P of 30 mm Hg in muscle that was not subjected to antecedent ischemia. In addition, once the critical pressure threshold of postischemic muscle was crossed, there was a more rapid rate of high-energy phosphate depletion than that seen in normal muscle pressurized to the same degree beyond its delta P threshold. For compartment syndromes that appear after relatively atraumatic ischemia (i.e., drug overdose-induced limb compression, proximal arterial trauma causing distal limb ischemia, etc.), of < or = 6 h, fasciotomy should be performed at a delta P < or = 40 mm Hg. Compartment pressure elevation after local blunt muscle trauma and ischemia may well require earlier or even prophylactic fasciotomy. Fasciotomy in ongoing postischemic compartment syndromes should be considered particularly urgent owing to the rapid rate of metabolic deterioration that is observed once the critical delta P threshold is crossed. The type of compartment syndrome should always be considered when interpreting tissue pressure measurements as indications for fasciotomy."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether angiographic patterns correlate with the clinical severity of acute lower limb ischemia (ALLI) and with the outcome of treatment with percutaneous intraarterial thrombolysis (PIAT). A retrospective analysis was conducted of angiograms and case records of 186 consecutive PIAT infusions in 160 patients with ALLI. The number of segments of occlusions; associated stenoses of inflow, outflow, and collateral vessels; and the demonstration of patent distal vessels were correlated with severity of ischemia and outcome of PIAT. Occlusions requiring flow to traverse one collateral bed to supply patent distal vessels (angiographic category I) correlated with the \"viable\" clinical classification of ALLI. Those requiring blood to flow through two contiguous collateral beds to supply patent distal vessels (category II) correlated with the \"threatened\" clinical classification. Occlusions with distal propagation that occluded the distal vascular bed (category III) correlated with the \"irreversible\" clinical category. Rates at 30 days for patency, amputation, and mortality were as follows for category I: 100%, 0%, and 0%; category II: 90%, 8.6%, and 0.7%; and category III: 55%, 19%, and 5%, respectively. Angiographic patterns correlate well with clinical severity of ischemia and predict the outcome from PIAT as initial therapy of ALLI. Amputation and mortality rates are less than those reported for emergency surgical treatment of ALLI."

Fifty-four patients out of 10457 admitted in the four Departments of Pneumology of the Binaghi Hospital (Cagliari) between 1-1-1985 and 31-3-1993, were referred to our Department of General Surgery due to non-thoracic surgical emergencies. There was a considerable delay in the referral (only 25% of patients within 12 hours from the onset of symptoms): indeed predominant respiratory symptoms, hypoxia and hypercapnia made these patients no responsive to symptoms of surgical emergency. Surgical emergencies in causal correlation with respiratory disease (intestinal occlusion due to abdominal metastases of lung carcinoma, complicated peptic ulcer) had the worst prognosis (mortality: 52.9%). Those in chance connection, such as acute limb ischemia and preexisting abdominal disease, had a less adverse outcome. Mortality, however, was 37.5%: this datum outlines the role of chronic lung disease in defining operative risk. The authors call attention to three groups of observed patients: 1) three patients were operated on for intestinal occlusion due to unrecognized abdominal neoplasia, that showed itself in the course of hospitalization in the Department of Pneumology for lung metastases; 2) in 3 cases symptoms and signs of acute abdomen were observed without abdominal disease. The cause of acute pseudoabdomen was diaphragmatic pleural or basal pulmonary inflammation; 3) the eight patients with pulmonary embolism were all admitted in the Department of Pneumology with a wrong diagnosis of bronchopneumonia."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine current practice in the treatment of all categories of popliteal aneurysms (PA) in light of the efficacy of intraarterial thrombolysis in PA presenting as acute ischemia. Prospective data collected from 19 vascular surgeons from 200 PA in 137 patients during a 4-year period from 1989. The most common presentation (125 PA) was leg ischemia, with the most severe symptom being claudication in 58, acute limb-threatening ischemia in 56, and digital atheroembolism in 11 limbs. The nonischemic group (75 PA) included 43 symptom-free cases and 32 cases with local symptoms arising from the popliteal fossa. Of 62 patients requiring emergency treatment, bypasses were done in 56, 10 of whom had early occlusion. Thrombolysis was used alone or in combination with bypass on 23 occasions, with 16 successful outcomes. Of 138 PA presenting electively, 80 underwent bypass, with one early occlusion, and 58 were observed. In the observed group, 18 later underwent bypass during a median follow-up of 22 months. The indications for late bypass were expansion of a small (< 2 cm) asymptomatic PA and the development of distal ischemia. There were 18 deaths in the observed group because of medical unfitness; limb ischemia did not develop during follow-up. Intraarterial thrombolysis is of value in restoring the distal run off before bypass in PA presenting as acute limb-threatening ischemia. However, the results do not justify an expectant policy for asymptomatic aneurysms."

An alternative technique currently available is continuous arteriovenous hemodiafiltration (CAVH-D). Records of 44 surgical patients with ARF who were treated with CAVH-D in our surgical intensive care unit from 1989 to 1992 were reviewed. Thirty-five patients underwent emergency operations, and 4 patients underwent elective operations. Thirty-three patients were hemodynamically unstable immediately prior to the institution of CAVH-D, making hemodialysis a contraindication. A total of 565 CAVH-D days with an average of 13 days per patient were evaluated. Seventeen patients survived, with recovery of renal function in 13 patients. Vascular access was obtained via 227 percutaneous femoral catheters and 4 Scribner shunts. Seven vascular complications occurred, including arteriovenous fistula, pseudoaneurysm, limb ischemia, femoral artery hemorrhage, and femoral vein thrombosis. Based on these data, we conclude that CAVH-D is a safe and effective alternative in surgical patients with ARF."

Patients with acute limb ischemia secondary to embolus or in situ thrombosis usually require emergency revascularization, either surgically or with the use of thrombolytic agents. It is commonly assumed that heparin therapy alone, without disobliterative intervention, can produce clinical improvement through continued patency and enlargement of the collateral circulation. The occurrence of spontaneous thrombolysis of major limb vessels is not generally accepted. We describe three patients, all with confirmed occlusion of either the iliac or superficial femoral arteries, who had spontaneous thrombolysis of occluded vessels. These experiences document that spontaneous resolution of arterial occlusion does occur, although it may be infrequent."

Forty patients (23 male), aged 49.4 years, have been operated at the hospital Clínico de la Universidad Católica. Twenty six presented with acute dissections. Angiography conformed the dissection in 63.3% and computed axial tomography in 84.6% of patients; lately, transesophageal echocardiography has become the most sensitive diagnostic method. Twenty three patients (57.5%) were subjected to emergency operations and 17 to semielective procedures. In 24 patients (60%) ascending aorta was replaced and in 16 a composite graft was used. Operative mortality was 27.5%. Univariate analysis showed that the period in which the operation was performed and the presence of limb ischemia were the only independent predictors of operative mortality. Long term follow up was achieved in 26 patients (89.6%). Actuarial 5 year survival without considering operative mortality was 87.9%. It is concluded that patients with acute dissections involving the ascending aorta should be operated as soon as the imaging diagnosis is complete and, since this is a palliative procedure, a close follow up is required for early detection of complications."

Sixty-one patients (82%) had severely threatened limb viability, and 13 (18%) had major irreversible ischemic limb changes at presentation. Eighty-six percent of patients were initially anticoagulated with heparin. Seventy percent underwent preoperative angiography. Surgical revascularization included 42 inflow and 20 outflow arterial reconstructions and 9 thrombectomy or embolectomy procedures. Mean follow-up was 17 months (range, 0 to 64). Life-table primary patency at 36 months for arterial reconstructions was 81% for inflow and 78% for outflow procedures. Cumulative limb salvage was 70% at 1 month and 68% at 36 months. Patient survival was 85% at 1 month and 51% at 36 months. No death was directly attributable to complications related to limb reperfusion, and no patient required dialysis for myoglobinuria. We conclude that management of severe, acute lower limb ischemia with early amputation of nonviable limbs and heparinization, angiography, and prompt operative revascularization for threatened but viable extremities minimizes morbidity and mortality rates, while maximizing limb salvage. These results may be useful for comparison with comparable groups of patients treated with thrombolytic or endovascular modalities."

This report describes patient characteristics that influence the clinical outcome of hip disarticulation. The medical records of all patients undergoing hip disarticulation from 1966 to 1989 were reviewed for surgical indication, perioperative wound complications, and postoperative deaths. Fifty-three patients underwent hip disarticulation for limb ischemia (10), infection (12), infection and ischemia (14), or tumor (17). The overall incidence of wound complications was 60%, and no significant differences were found among the groups. Prior above-knee amputation and urgent/emergent operations were significantly associated with increased wound complications (p less than 0.05). The overall mortality rate was 21%, ranging from 0% (tumor) to 50% (ischemia) and differed significantly among the groups (p less than 0.02). Mortality was significantly associated with urgent/emergent operations (p less than 0.01). Age, diabetes mellitus, and previous inflow procedures did not influence mortality rates. The presence of limb ischemia influenced mortality rates to a greater extent than did infection, and a history of cardiac disease was statistically predictive of death. Wound complications frequently accompanied hip disarticulation, regardless of operative indication, and were significantly increased by urgent/emergent operations and prior above-knee amputation. Hip disarticulation can be performed with low mortality rates in selected patients. Both limb ischemia and infection substantially increase operative mortality rates."

    "title": "Acute peripheral arterial occlusion.",
    "abstract": "Acute arterial occlusion resulting in limb ischemia may be caused by a diverse array of conditions but most often is the result of an arterial embolism or thrombosis of a previously diseased vessel. Differentiation of these two primary entities may be difficult, but a careful history, thorough physical examination, and liberal use of arteriography can usually separate them. Distinction is important because an embolus is almost always best treated by prompt operation, whereas management of acute arterial thrombosis is often improved when the limb is viable, and emergency operation can be deferred. The significant underlying cardiac problems responsible for an embolus continue to cause appreciable morbidity and mortality after arterial embolectomy despite simplification in the operative procedure itself and steady improvement in limb salvage. Although the risk of emergency surgical treatment of acute arterial thrombosis is usually less than that associated with embolectomy, results of salvage of the limb are often less satisfactory. Nonoperative management of acute ischemia by high-dose antiocoagulation alone or use of fibrinolytic drugs may also be useful in specific circumstances. Exact indications for the use and likely benefits of such nonoperative therapy remain unsettled."

Mortality rates of approximately 10-30% and amputation rates of the same magnitude in the survivors are repeatedly reported despite advances in medical and surgical techniques. Our experience, which utilized percutaneous intra-arterial thrombolysis as the initial treatment in 72 instances (63 patients), has resulted in a markedly lower mortality rate of 1.6% and a lower amputation rate of 8.5% in the survivors. Careful categorization by clinical degree of ischemia indicates that 82% of the cases were either threatened or irreversible limb ischemia. The initial treatment with thrombolysis did not preclude subsequent prompt surgical treatment when necessary; in these cases, thrombolysis promoted improved surgical results (100%) when it was successful. It markedly reduced the need for urgent surgery, usually simplified the subsequent surgical approach, diminished the overall need for surgery, and often accomplished a successful outcome alone (31%). Significant bleeding was not noted during subsequent surgical procedures and was noted in only 2.8% of the cases. Confirmation of these results and further improvements in technique might justify the use of an initially high-dose urokinase transcatheter infusion regimen as the initial treatment of choice for acute lower-limb ischemia."

The measurement of tcPO2 and foot-chest tcPO2 was found to be more sensitive to degrees of severity of limb ischemia and more closely associated with the outcome of revascularization than AP and ABI. TcPCO2 and tcPO2/tcPCO2 were not useful in assessment of the vascular patient undergoing reconstructive surgery. Before operation, tcPO2 less than or equal to 22 torr and foot-chest tcPO2 less than or equal to 0.46 indicate severe limb ischemia requiring urgent revascularization. After operation, tcPO2 less than or equal to 22 torr and foot-chest tcPO2 index less than or equal to 0.53 indicate that revascularization is likely to fail. We conclude that tcPO2 monitoring, as a metabolic test of actual tissue perfusion, is a more reliable indicator of preoperative limb ischemia and postoperative outcome of revascularization than hemodynamic, Doppler-derived pressure tests."

Overall prognosis was poor; only 46 of the 90 patients were alive at postoperative follow-up averaging 23 months. Limb ischemia arose in 20%, with incidence uninfluenced by catheter insertion technique (percutaneous v. 'open'). Surgical treatment was required for half of the ischemic limbs. Groin hematoma commonly followed percutaneous extraction of IABP catheter, whereas 'open' removal was always hemostatic, with potential for embolectomy. Percutaneous insertion of IABP catheter via the femoral artery is the method of choice in an emergency situation. 'Open' Seldinger technique is preferable in the operating room. For elective IABP catheter removal, the 'open', hemostatic technique is recommended. If limb-threatening ischemia develops, the catheter must be removed. If the patient is IABP-dependent, the contralateral femoral artery or the ascending aorta should be considered as an alternative catheter route."

    "abstract": "One hundred two patients with acute lower limb ischemia were treated with intra-arterial streptokinase. Thirty-seven patients had occluded vascular grafts and sixty-five had had no previous vascular surgery. Eighty-six limbs were acutely threatened. Intra-arterial streptokinase was given as an initial loading dose with a lower maintenance dose given afterward. The mean duration of therapy was 59 hours and hematologic monitoring was meticulous. Indications for intra-arterial streptokinase therapy were contraindication to surgery, anticipation of technically difficult surgery, and multiple occlusions that required separate surgical approaches. Seventy-two legs were saved (71%) and 30 amputated. Morbidity was low and only 1 of the 11 deaths was attributable to streptokinase. No leg was lost that would otherwise have been saved by straightforward surgery and no leg was lost that had not been previously threatened. In 46 patients for whom emergency femorotibial bypass would have been necessary, 35 legs (76%) were saved. Forty-three patients had vascular reconstruction immediately after streptokinase therapy was stopped, to bypass occlusive lesions that had been demonstrated by the thrombolytic therapy in 28 patients, and because streptokinase had produced no response in 15 patients. The advantages of intra-arterial streptokinase in the management of the acutely ischemic leg are that the leg may be saved without surgery, that surgery is not precluded, that the patient can be made as fit as possible for surgery during the streptokinase infusion, and that streptokinase can facilitate surgery by delineating underlying vascular pathologic conditions and clearing distal runoff vessels."

    "abstract": "This study reports our experience with 10 patients who underwent the emergent construction of a femorofemoral bypass graft to salvage an acutely ischemic lower extremity following the insertion of a transfemoral intra-aortic balloon pump catheter. All patients had excellent resolution of the ischemia and salvage of the extremity. Half of the procedures were done at the bedside with the remainder performed in the operating room. No long-term infections or ischemic sequelae resulted from the procedures in the nine patients available for long-term follow-up. The use of femorofemoral bypass grafting is, therefore, recommended in patients with severe ipsilateral limb ischemia who are dependent on an intra-aortic balloon pump to prevent extremity tissue loss as well as the systemic metabolic manifestations of ongoing tissue ischemia and necrosis. Patient selection, technical considerations, and postoperative management are discussed."

    "title": "\"Coral reef\" atherosclerosis of the suprarenal aorta: a unique clinical entity.",
    "abstract": "Localized obstruction in a suprarenal aorta of normal diameter is rare. Between 1970 and 1983, nine patients (all women, mean age 51 years) required aortic reconstruction to relieve severe lower extremity ischemia (nine patients), hypertension (nine), visceral ischemia (two), and congestive heart failure (three) caused by an eccentric, heavily calcified polypoid lesion originating from the posterior surface of the suprarenal aorta. This mass typically began at the level of the diaphragm and extended to the level of the renal arteries, almost totally occluding the aortic lumen. The rock-hard, irregular, gritty, whitish surface strongly resembled a coral reef. Elective revascularization was carried out in eight patients, and an emergency procedure was necessary in one patient who had acute aortic thrombosis with catastrophic visceral, renal, and lower extremity ischemia. The suprarenal atheroma was removed en bloc through a retroperitoneal thoracoabdominal aortic endarterectomy. Concomitant aortoiliofemoral revascularization was necessary in seven patients (five prosthetic grafts, two endarterectomies). Two patients died postoperatively. The seven long-term survivors remain asymptomatic at a mean follow-up interval of 4 years after revascularization, without evidence of recurrence of this lesion. Suprarenal \"coral reef\" atherosclerosis should be considered if visceral, renal, and limb ischemia is not adequately explained by the arteriographic pattern of conventional atherosclerosis. This unusual atheroma exhibited extensive calcification and metaplastic bone formation, although its precise pathophysiology remains to be defined."

    "title": "Acute arterial thrombosis of the lower extremity. Its natural history contrasted with arterial embolism.",
    "abstract": "We compared a group of 52 patients with acute lower extremity ischemia secondary to arterial thrombosis with a series of 220 patients with peripheral embolism who were seen at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, from 1967 through 1980. The conditions of patients with arterial thrombosis were misdiagnosed as acute embolism at a rate of 20%. Mortality in the patients with embolism was significantly higher. While patients with acute embolism were routinely treated with embolectomy, two thirds of the patients with thrombotic occlusion required surgery during their initial hospitalization for ongoing severe ischemia. More than half of these operations were carried out as emergency procedures. Limb salvage in surgically treated patients with arterial thrombosis was inferior to that seen with embolism. Early revascularization for acute thrombosis was carried out with a 30-day patency rate of 82%. While the mortality associated with acute thrombosis was significantly lower than that seen with peripheral embolism, the risk of major amputation was 35%. There should be no reluctance to proceed with indicated vascular reconstruction in the setting of acute limb ischemia secondary to arterial thrombosis."

    "abstract": "A case is described of a woman admitted to the emergency room with myocardial infarction and acute leg ischemia and suspected thromboembolism. Surgical exploration of the common femoral artery and its branches was performed. The surgical outcome and the subsequent clinical course suggested the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma which was supported by isotopic red-cell labelling study and catecholamine measurement. The very high values of catecholamine production explained the marked and persistent arterial vasospasm which led to marked and irreversible ischemia."

    "title": "Management of acute thromboembolic limb ischemia.",
    "abstract": "Acute arterial occlusion affecting the extremities remains a significant cause of death and limb loss. Our approach to the management of these patients has been selective, and it is based upon a clinical distinction between embolism and thrombosis. Patients with acute embolic occlusion are treated with prompt embolectomy. Patients with thrombosis are given a course of heparin therapy, followed by elective arterial repair if necessary. Deterioration of the limb is an indication for emergency reconstruction, and nonviable limbs are amputated early. This approach to treatment was assessed in a 1-year prospective study, involving 29 patients with embolism and 50 patients with thrombosis. The initial diagnosis was found to be incorrect for seven patients (8.9%). Of the patients with embolism, four died (13.8%) and three required amputation (10.4%). There were six deaths (12%) among the patients with thrombosis, but eleven required amputation (22%), and in seven of these amputation was the definitive treatment. We have concluded that the selective use of surgery is an appropriate method of treatment for patients with acute thromboembolic limb ischemia."

    "title": "Unappreciated causes of ischemia in the leg.",
    "abstract": "Limb ischemia due to blunt trauma, dissecting hematoma, and cardiac dysfunction jeopardizes limbs and lives more than is generally appreciated. Delay in diagnosis after blunt trauma led to major amputation in 21 percent of our patients. Current principles avoid those hazards. Five patients presented with acute limb ischemia caused by dissecting hematoma of the aorta. Suspicion of that diagnosis is warranted in patients without a history of chronic vascular occlusive disease or cardiac disease, in young white males with Marfan characteristics, and in middle-aged hypertensive black males. Confirmation of the diagnosis requires urgent angiography. In selected cases, treatment with femorofemoral bypass will be limb- and life-saving. Ischemia due to low flow, which portends a dire prognosis, should be suspected in severely ill patients with a history of peripheral vascular disease. Analysis of cardiac and metabolic functions with the Automated Physiologic Profile system identified the cause of the low flow state in 10 patients, permitting precise management with specific therapy. A discernible improvement in circulatory status of the limb coincided with correction of the low flow states. Angiography and surgery were not necessary in 90 percent of this group, and should be avoided during low flow episodes."

    "title": "Late appearance of arterial emboli: diagnosis and management.",
    "abstract": "Although the occurrence of an arterial embolus is usually a cataclysmic event prompting emergency presentationand early diagnosis, we have managed 22 patients who presented more than 48 hours after the onset of symptoms. The diagnosis was apparent in only six patients. The remainder had subacute limb ischemia, and arteriography was used to help delineate the diagnosis in 14 of these patients. In most instances arteriograms were atypical of chronic occlusive disease, rather than diagnostic of arterial emboli. Embolectomy was performed a mean of 13 days after the onset of symptoms, with retrieval of thromboembolic material in all instances. Two patients died (mortality rate of 9%), and the limb salvage rate for the 25 limbs explored was 88%. Among 22 lower extremity embolectomies, foot pulses were restored in 13 patients (59%), and four patients (18%) had viable extremities without pulses. Adjunctive arterial reconstruction was required in three patients."

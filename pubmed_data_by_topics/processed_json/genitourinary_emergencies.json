    "title": "Qualitative assessment of facilitators and barriers to testicular torsion care: Findings from the testicular torsion collaborative.",
    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a well-documented pediatric urological emergency that poses a time-sensitive risk to the testicle and long-term morbidity. Despite the urgent nature of testicular torsion, few studies have explored the institutional and clinical factors that influence diagnosis and management. To address this gap, we performed qualitative focus group interviews across the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Pediatric (NSQIPP) Testicular Torsion Collaborative to better understand facilitators and barriers to testicular torsion care. Relevant stakeholders involved in testicular torsion care (i.e. emergency department, radiology, urology, peri-operative services, anesthesia, and surgical quality leadership) across the Testicular Torsion Collaborative were invited to participate in focus group interviews led by a moderator and included a note-taker. All focus groups were recorded and transcribed via Zoom™ audio-visual conferencing software. Inductive coding was performed by 3 reviewers using Dedoose (Los Angeles CA). Themes were designated within the Theoretical Domain Framework (TDF) construct for implementation science and determined to be either a facilitator or barrier to testicular torsion care. Of the 29 invited sites, 10 sites and 47 individuals participated. Thematic saturation was reached for 20 themes, each represented in at least 2 focus group discussions. All elements of the TDF were represented in the discussions. Community education, culture of quality, high standard of care expectations, and leveraging available data were universally seen as facilitators. Long term follow-up and outcomes, manual detorsion care, and competing care demands were universally seen as barriers. Based on focus groups of stakeholders in all aspects of testicular torsion care, opportunities to improve care include leveraging quality improvement culture and resources (i.e. trained personnel, data). Barriers to care include competing care demands arising from outside transfers and institutional clinical volume. We hope readers can use this data as a framework to improve in testicular torsion care."

    "title": "Prioritization: Intracranial Hemorrhage, Testicular Torsion, and Tricyclic Antidepressant Toxicity Presenting to a Community Emergency Department.",
    "abstract": "This case is designed for emergency medicine residents preparing for the American Board of Emergency Medicine Certifying Exam (ABEM). While we tested the case with third year emergency medicine residents, it could also be used with first- and second-year residents to develop complex decision-making and prioritization skills in a simulated environment. Emergency medicine requires physicians to rapidly prioritize care, stabilize critically ill patients, adapt to changing clinical circumstances, and delegate tasks and resources. Traditional oral board cases emphasize single-patient encounters rather than multitasking or task-switching. This prioritization case better aligns with the clinical workflow of a shift in the emergency department, including triage, teamwork, and flexibility. This case forces learners to make timely decisions with incomplete information, giving examiners insight into how the examinee performs in the clinical environment. By the end of this case learners should: 1) Become familiar with the format of a prioritization case (a component of the ABEM Certifying Exam), 2) demonstrate their ability to prioritize multiple patients and provide stabilizing care, 3) consider changes in status/patient acuity/new cases as presented, 4) understand how to utilize team resources appropriately. A group of five emergency medicine faculty with experience in simulation and oral board case design created a 15-minute practice prioritization case. This case is based on information provided by ABEM on the prioritization case format from the ABEM Certifying Exam. Learners are presented with evolving patient scenarios via tracking boards and prompted to prioritize, stabilize, task switch, and delegate as they manage multiple patients. The case is intended to be administered with two examiners and one examinee at a time. We used a group debrief structure, but this case can also be debriefed with each individual learner. This case was tested on 18 third-year emergency medicine residents. Following the case, each resident completed an anonymous two-item evaluation. The first item, \"This case increased my understanding of the certifying exam format,\" was scored on a 5-point Likert scale from \"strongly disagree\" to \"strongly agree.\" The second item, \"How would you rate the overall quality of this case?\" was scored on a 5-point Likert scale from \"poor\" to \"excellent.\" Sixteen of eighteen (89%) examinees completed the post-case evaluation. All respondents (100%) \"agreed\" or \"strongly agreed\" that the case improved their understanding of the ABEM Certifying Exam format. Overall case quality was rated 4.88/5, and all learners rated the case \"very good\" or \"excellent.\" This case was effective in simulating the competing demands of the clinical environment while also preparing learners for a new exam format. During the group debrief session, learners appreciated the pace, needing to stabilize multiple patients, and reacting to new information as it was presented. This case significantly improved residents' understanding of the prioritization case type that will be tested on the ABEM Certifying Exam. It also provides a controlled environment for program faculty to observe how residents perform managing multiple sick patients simultaneously.

    "title": "Comparison of Testicular Workup for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion (TWIST), Testicular Torsion (TT Lim), and Boettcher Alert (BAL) Scoring Systems for the Diagnosis of Testicular Torsion in 50 Surgical Cases.",
    "abstract": "Objective The objective of the study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of three clinical scoring systems (Testicular Workup for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion (TWIST), Testicular Torsion Lim (TT developed by Lim), and Boettcher Alert (BAL) scoring systems) for testicular torsion (TT) in patients presenting with acute scrotum. Methods This retrospective study included 50 patients who underwent emergency scrotal exploration at the Saga University Hospital between January 2010 and December 2023. The TWIST, TT (Lim), and BAL scores were calculated from medical records, and their diagnostic performance was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Saga University. Results Out of 50 patients, 34 (68%) were diagnosed with TT. The TWIST score showed 88.2% sensitivity, 43.8% specificity, 90.9% PPV, and 87.5% NPV. The TT (Lim) score demonstrated 85.3% sensitivity, 18.8% specificity, 96.7% PPV, and 100% NPV. The BAL score showed the highest sensitivity (94.1%) but lower specificity (37.5%), with a PPV of 76.2% and an NPV of 75.0%. All scores showed statistically significant associations with the TT diagnosis (p<0.01). Conclusions The TWIST, TT (Lim), and BAL scores have unique advantages in evaluating an acute scrotum. BAL may be most suitable for initial screening because of its high sensitivity, whereas TWIST may aid surgical decision-making. The TT score may be useful in ruling out torsion in selected low-risk cases, although validation in larger cohorts is required."

    "title": "Impact of COVID-19 on testicular torsion: A single-center retrospective study from a children's hospital.",
    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a urological emergency necessitating immediate surgical intervention. However, the altered medical environment during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic posed several challenges and the current study aimed to analyze its effects on the treatment of pediatric testicular torsion cases. We retrospectively analyzed 47 pediatric patients diagnosed with testicular torsion at Severance Children's Hospital from 2009 to 2022. Patients were categorized into pre-COVID-19 (n=38) and COVID-19 (n=8) groups. Data were collected for each patient, and the differences between the two groups were statistically analyzed. The patients' median age was from 13 years (range, 1-19 years) to 13 years (range, 1-16 years) between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 period (p=0.309). The analysis revealed a significant difference between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 groups in the time from symptom onset to emergency department arrival (6.4 hours [0.7-120.0] vs. 20.0 hours [1.3-288.0], p=0.031) and the time from symptom onset to surgery start (19.5 hours [4.5-124.3] vs. 28.5 hours [6.1-293.4], p=0.047). The median postoperative size of the affected testis was 9.8 mL (range, 2.0-13.9 mL) during the COVID-19 period, compared to 1.6 mL (range, 0.1-7.3 mL) in pre-COVID-19 period (p=0.012). The testicular volume ratio (affected/unaffected) was used to evaluate outcomes across patients with varying ages and testicular sizes. The current study shows that pandemic-related delays in treatment may worsen ischemic injury in testicular torsion, emphasizing the importance of timely intervention even during global crises."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a common urological emergency that can lead to irreversible spermatogenic dysfunction and infertility. Sophocarpine, derived from Sophora flavescens Ait, has demonstrated broad therapeutic effects, including protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). However, its effects on testicular IRI remain underexplored. This study aimed to assess the protective effects of sophocarpine on bilateral testes in a rat model and to investigate the underlying mechanisms involved. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to five groups: the sham, control, sophocarpine, control + wortmannin, and sophocarpine + wortmannin groups (n = 7 rats per group). All groups, except for the sham group, underwent unilateral testicular IRI. The procedure involved 3 h of right spermatic cord torsion (720° clockwise) followed by 3 h of detorsion. Sophocarpine (administered at a dose of 30 mg/kg) was given to the rats in the respective treatment groups. The therapeutic effects were evaluated via histological analysis, oxidative stress assessment, inflammatory response measurement, protein analysis, and immunohistochemistry. Sophocarpine treatment significantly protected the bilateral testes after unilateral testicular torsion-detorsion, as indicated by a reduction in the testis weight-to-body weight (TW/BW) ratio, testicular volume, and structural damage. Additionally, sophocarpine increased the seminiferous tubule diameter and epithelial height. The treatment also suppressed oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Notably, sophocarpine inhibited ferroptosis through the AKT signaling pathway, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of AKT in the testes. Furthermore, the AKT inhibitor wortmannin reversed both the phosphorylation of AKT and the protective effects of sophocarpine on the testes. Sophocarpine effectively protects the bilateral testes after unilateral testicular torsion-detorsion, with protective effects through ferroptosis mediated by the AKT signaling pathway, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in testicular IRI."

    "abstract": "To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and reliability of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in pediatric acute scrotal emergencies and assess its impact on clinical decision-making for differentiating surgical from non-surgical conditions. This prospective study conducted at a tertiary care center between March 2023 and October 2024, included 294 pediatric patients (age 1-17.9 years) presenting to the pediatric emergency department with acute scrotal pain. POCUS examinations were performed using B-mode and color Doppler imaging. Diagnoses were confirmed through surgical intervention (n = 102), clinical follow-up (n = 58), or imaging follow-up (n = 134). Statistical analyses included diagnostic accuracy metrics, logistic regression for identifying predictors of surgical emergencies, and inter-examiner agreement using Cohen's kappa. POCUS demonstrated 100% diagnostic accuracy in our sample for inflammatory conditions, testicular trauma, infarction, and scrotal abscess. For testicular torsion, sensitivity and specificity were 89.5% and 100%, while for appendiceal torsion, they were 94% and 97.5%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified six significant predictors of surgical emergencies, with the strongest being scrotal tenderness (OR = 4.48, p < 0.001), reduced/absent Doppler vascularization (OR = 3.67, p < 0.001), and scrotal skin changes (OR = 3.32, p < 0.001). Inter-examiner agreement was almost perfect for hydrocele (κ = 0.91), testicular torsion (κ = 0.90), hematocele (κ = 0.86), and skin thickening (κ = 0.81). POCUS offers high diagnostic accuracy for most pediatric scrotal conditions, though with relatively lower sensitivity for testicular torsion, requiring careful clinical correlation. When combined with clinical assessment, POCUS effectively differentiates surgical from non-surgical emergencies, potentially reducing unnecessary surgical interventions."

    "abstract": "To evaluate the role of manual detorsion (MD) in gonadal salvage and determining non-emergency surgery in testicular torsion (TT). We retrospectively analysed paediatric patients treated for TT over 10 years at a tertiary centre. MD was attempted based on surgeon preference. Successful MD was defined by complete pain resolution, and normal colour Doppler ultrasound showing no spermatic cord torsion and normal perfusion. All patients underwent surgical exploration. Data analysed included age, referral status, pain duration, MD attempt and result, time to surgery, surgical findings, and outcomes. A comparative analysis between data from previous a published series (2014-2018) and after previous published series (2019-2023) was executed. Two hundred and seventy-six patients were included. Sixty percent were referred from other centres (165/276). MD was attempted in 57 % (156/276), resulting in significantly less gonadal loss (9 % vs 46 %, p < 0.05). MD was successful in 44 % (68/156) of attempts; all underwent non-emergency bilateral orchiopexy; one patient developed new TT during the waiting period, successfully treated with MD; at surgery, three (3/68, 4 %) cases had partial non-ischemic cord torsion and none suffered testicular loss. After unsuccessful MD, residual cord torsion was 33 % (29/88). After median follow-up of 8 months, gonadal loss (14/156, 9 %) occurred after unsuccessful MD; no losses occurred following successful MD. Successful MD correlated with significantly improved gonadal salvage (p < 0.05). There was no gonadal loss after non-emergency surgery. Our data shows that attempting MD results in increased testicular salvage rates, and that a successful manoeuvre may safely enable non-emergency orchiopexy."

    "abstract": "Acute scrotum is a common pediatric urological emergency, with testicular torsion requiring prompt surgical intervention to prevent irreversible ischemic damage. In Japan, large-scale multicenter data on diagnostic and management practices remain limited. This multicenter retrospective study reviewed pediatric patients (aged 0-21 years) presenting with acute scrotal pain across 15 institutions in the Kyushu-Okinawa region between 2014 and 2023. Clinical characteristics, diagnostic workup, initial facility type, specialty of first-contact physician, and care pathway were analyzed. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with testicular salvage. A total of 906 patients were included (median age, 11 years). Final diagnoses were epididymitis (41.9%), testicular torsion (26.8%), torsion of the testicular appendage (12.1%), and other causes (19.2%). Among torsion patients (n = 243), ultrasonography was performed in 98.8%, TWIST scoring in 31.7%, and inter-facility transfer was required in 66.7%. Multivariable analysis identified three independent predictors of testicular salvage: Time from symptom onset to skin incision < 6 h (OR 3.38, 95% CI 1.56-7.36, p = 0.002), age ≥ 10 years (OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.28-5.75, p = 0.009), and same-hospital treatment (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.23-6.07, p = 0.013). Frequent inter-facility transfers significantly reduce testicular salvage rates, underscoring the importance of timely surgical management within the same hospital. Regional standardized protocols, provider education, and public health awareness campaigns are warranted to minimize preoperative delay and improve outcomes for pediatric testicular torsion."

Examination revealed a firm, tender, irreducible mass in the left inguinal canal and an empty left hemiscrotum. The right testis was retractile and non-tender. Doppler ultrasound showed absent blood flow to the left testis, prompting urgent surgical exploration. Intraoperatively, the testis was incarcerated within the left inguinal canal amid dense post-surgical adhesions. After adhesiolysis, the testis was viable and mobilized for tension-free orchidopexy via a subdartos pouch. The contralateral testis was also fixated. We hypothesize acquired canalicular cryptorchidism due to post-herniorrhaphy scarring causing vascular compromise from extrinsic compression. This rare mimic of torsion underscores the importance of recognizing atypical presentations of a threatened testis and demonstrates timely surgery is feasible in rural settings with remote specialist support."

    "abstract": "Epididymal cysts are common benign lesions that typically present as painless scrotal masses. They predominantly occur in adult males but can also be found in adolescents, albeit with a higher likelihood of being overlooked at this age. Most patients experience relief or complete resolution of symptoms following conservative treatment. However, large cysts pose a risk of torsion. Torsion of an epididymal cyst in adolescents is clinically rare, with only a few reported cases to date, presenting diagnostic challenges for clinicians. We report three cases of epididymal cysts in adolescents. Case 1 involved an asymptomatic cyst treated with aspiration, demonstrating significant cyst reduction at 4-month follow-up. Case 2 presented a persistent simple cyst managed by elective surgical excision with pathological confirmation after prolonged surveillance showed no resolution. Case 3 presented acutely with pain and suspected torsion on scrotal ultrasound, requiring emergency surgical intervention that revealed a 720° torsion of the epididymal cyst combined with 180° testicular torsion, treated testis detorsion and cyst excision. All cases achieved favorable outcomes. Epididymal cysts in adolescents warrant a tailored management strategy. While aspiration or elective excision are effective for non-acute cases, the potential for synchronous testicular torsion necessitates a high index of suspicion and prompt surgical exploration in acute presentations to preserve testicular viability."

    "title": "Testicular Torsion in Inguinal Cryptorchidism: Report on Two Patients and Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "Undescended testis (UT) is a common congenital urological condition in boys, with an incidence of 2-8%. Orchiopexy is the recommended surgical treatment for UT, ideally performed before 12 months of age, with a latest window of 18 months. Testicular torsion (TT) is a pediatric urological emergency, occurring in 3.8 per 100,000 boys. While both UT and TT are common conditions individually, their co-occurrence in children under 18 months is rare and represents a challenging clinical scenario, especially when diagnosis and treatment are delayed, increasing the risk of testicular necrosis. This report describes two cases of testicular torsion in undescended testes in infants under 1 year of age. Both patients were presented to the hospital more than 24 h after symptom onset. Such delay led to the possibility of testicular salvage being lost due to necrosis. The first case involved a 10-month-old infant with bilateral undescended testis, who underwent orchiectomy after 36 h of torsion. The second case involved a 7-month-old baby, where a delayed diagnosis led to orchiectomy following 36 h of torsion. Both children were previously on the waiting list for orchiopexy, and in both cases contralateral orchiopexy was performed. A review of the literature on PubMed using the key-words \"cryptorchid\", \"undescended testis\", and \"testicular torsion\" revealed 36 cases of UT complicated by TT in children under 18 months, showing a high incidence of orchiectomies due to delayed diagnosis. Testicular torsion in undescended testis in children under 18 months is rare but associated with a high risk of gonadal necrosis. The key to improving testicular salvage rates is timely diagnosis and intervention, ideally within 6 h of symptom onset. Delayed presentation due to atypical clinical signs, such as inguinal swelling or nonspecific symptoms, complicates early detection and thus testicular salvage. Therefore, it is crucial for both parents and pediatricians to recognize the potential for torsion in cryptorchidic patients, emphasizing the importance of early surgical intervention, including orchiopexy, to prevent torsion and its associated complications."

Scrotal Doppler ultrasonography serves as an effective, non-invasive diagnostic tool by demonstrating absent venous flow within the pampiniform plexus while confirming normal testicular perfusion. We present a case of spontaneous pampiniform venous plexus thrombosis diagnosed using Doppler ultrasound. The patient was successfully managed with conservative measures, including anticoagulation, analgesics, and brief bed rest, resulting in complete resolution of symptoms and normalization on follow-up imaging. This case underscores the importance of including pampiniform plexus thrombosis in the differential diagnosis of acute testicular pain and highlights the pivotal role of scrotal Doppler in guiding timely and appropriate treatment, thereby preventing unnecessary surgical intervention.

Different assessment approaches were suggested to improve overall patient outcomes, as the Testicular Workup for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion (TWIST) score, which has been integrated with ultrasound findings to enhance diagnostic accuracy in suspected cases of testicular torsion. Additionally, Doppler ultrasound is recommended in accordance with recently updated national and international guidelines. This is a retrospective study conducted at Bronglais General Hospital (BGH), Aberystwyth, United Kingdom, from January 2019 to January 2024 of patients who had undergone scrotal exploration for suspected TT. A total of 34 patients were included in the study. The study aims to review the management of all patients who present to BGH with suspected \"testicular torsion\" as per available national & international guidelines, aiming to develop a local protocol. Also, the study aims to investigate the potential causes of the delay in management of patients presented with scrotal pain and to structure a local management pathway for patients presented with scrotal pain at BGH. Out of 34 patients in our study, 67.64% (n=23) were in the age group of 11 to 20 years. Only 38% (n=13) had confirmed TT. Of these 13 patients, 69.23% (n=9) of the testes were viable, and in 30.77% (n=4), the testis was not viable. The TWIST score was applied in only 6% (n=2) of cases. Ultrasound was performed in only 9% (n=3) of cases. To improve surgical outcomes for scrotal pain exploration and reduce delays in intervention, it is important to address existing documentation gaps and the inconsistent use of diagnostic tools such as the TWIST score and ultrasound, even though TT is generally managed in a timely manner at BGH. However, a local protocol has been developed that includes direct referral to the on-call surgical registrar to further decrease time to theatre. It also includes the TWIST score to guide diagnosis. Raising awareness of children and their carers/parents is of paramount importance. A proposed pathway for the management of patients with scrotal pain and suspected of TT at BGH was developed and will be followed up on in future practice."

This study investigated the protective effects of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor rosuvastatin on TT-induced I/R injury and explored the underlying mechanisms. Male Balb/C mice (n = 28) were subjected to 720° testicular torsion for two hours, followed by 24 h of detorsion. Rosuvastatin was administered either acutely (post-torsion) or prophylactically (prior to injury). Histopathological evaluation, assessment of oxidative stress parameters, sperm motility and morphology analysis, and Western blot examination of survival and stress related signaling proteins (pAKT, pJNK1/2, pERK1/2, and Bcl-xL) were performed. Rosuvastatin treatment significantly reduced tissue damage decreased oxidative stress (as indicated by increased TAS and reduced TOS/OSI), and improved sperm motility and morphology. Both acute and prophylactic treatment regimens enhanced cell survival by increasing pAKT and Bcl-xL levels, reducing pERK1/2 activation, and modulating stress responsive JNK1/2 signaling. These findings suggest that rosuvastatin mitigates I/R induced testicular damage primarily through modulation of key intracellular pathways, particularly PI3K/AKT, and support its therapeutic potential in acute testicular injuries and related degenerative conditions."

A 3-month-old boy presented with an empty right hemiscrotum. Imaging revealed a right intra-abdominal mass (22.8 × 15.9 × 21.3 mm) and left testicular lesion (7.1 × 3.9 × 7.0 mm). Serum alpha-fetoprotein was within normal limits for age, suggesting benign disease. Laparoscopy confirmed a torsed necrotic right testicular mass, managed by orchiectomy. Left testis-sparing surgery excised a separate tumor. Histopathology confirmed bilateral mature teratoma. Hormonal profiles, including testosterone (0.81 ng/mL) and follicle-stimulating hormone (3.74 mIU/mL), as well as karyotype (46,XY), were normal. No additional therapy was required, as mature teratomas are benign. Postoperative alpha-fetoprotein levels normalized, with no recurrence at 6-month follow-up. Parental education regarding testicular examination is important for early detection of future abnormalities. Tumors associated with intra-abdominal undescended testes warrant urgent intervention due to torsion risk. Surgery preserving testicular tissue is recommended for bilateral benign teratomas to maintain fertility. Serial alpha-fetoprotein monitoring and ultrasound surveillance are essential postoperatively."

It has not been validated in Australia to date. Scrotal ultrasound is also not routinely recommended for patients presenting with an acute scrotum in Australia. This study assessed TWIST's utility and validity in an Australian paediatric setting and compared it to clinical suspicion alone. This prospective observation cohort study enrolled 307 patients aged 3 months to 18 years; 116 (37.8%) were assessed by Emergency Department (ED) doctors only, 81 (26.4%) by surgeons only and 110 (35.8%) by both. Doctors recorded their clinical suspicion of testicular torsion (nil/low/intermediate/high). TWIST scores were calculated post data collection. Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values were calculated for TWIST values and clinical suspicion risk levels. Receiver Operator Curves (ROC) were constructed to analyse and compare TWIST and clinical suspicion. Area under the ROC (AUC) for ED TWIST score was 0.768 (95% CI = 0.674, 0.862). The AUC for ED clinical suspicion was 0.866 (95% CI = 0.791, 0.940) (p = 0.035). For surgeons, the AUC for TWIST was 0.876 (95% CI = 0.809, 0.943) and for clinical suspicion was 0.899 (95% CI = 0.822, 0.976) (p = 0.962). Our study found there was no evidence that TWIST is superior to clinical acumen alone, and there is some evidence that ED doctors' clinical acumen may perform better than TWIST."

    "abstract": "Urological emergencies are often time-critical and require structured action. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) translate guidelines into concrete processes and can improve the quality of care. Literature review on the effects of SOPs in urological emergency management. SOPs increase guideline adherence, shorten diagnosis and treatment times, and reduce morbidity, mortality, and length of hospital stay. Examples include \"Code Torsion\" for testicular torsion, sepsis bundles for urosepsis, and SOP checkboxes for priapism. National programs such as the British GIRFT initiative show that standardized SOPs reduce treatment variability and allow resources to be used more efficiently. SOPs increase efficiency, safety, and structure in urological emergency care while also helping to relieve pressure on the healthcare system. HINTERGRUND: Urologische Notfälle sind häufig zeitkritisch und erfordern strukturiertes Handeln. „Standard operating procedures“ (SOP) übersetzen Leitlinien in konkrete Abläufe und können die Versorgungsqualität verbessern. Der Beitrag bietet eine Literaturübersicht zu Effekten von SOP im urologischen Notfallmanagement. Die SOP steigern die Leitlinienadhärenz, verkürzen Diagnose- und Therapiezeiten und senken Morbidität, Mortalität sowie Krankenhausverweildauer. Beispiele sind „code torsion“ bei Hodentorsion, Sepsis-Bundles bei Urosepsis und SOP-Checkboxen beim Priapismus. Nationale Programme wie die britische GIRFT-Initiative zeigen, dass standardisierte SOP Behandlungsvariabilität reduzieren und Ressourcen effizienter genutzt werden. Die SOP erhöhen Effizienz, Sicherheit und Struktur in der urologischen Notfallversorgung und leisten zugleich einen Beitrag zur Systementlastung."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion (TT) is a pediatric emergency that requires a prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention to increase the likelihood of testicular salvage. Pre-pubescent males have a heightened risk of undergoing an orchiectomy compared to post-pubescent males with TT. We sought to identify specific factors characteristic of pre-pubescent males compared to post-pubescent males. This retrospective analysis of a pediatric TT dataset over a 10-year period (January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2024) was conducted at a pediatric acute care children's hospital in a metropolitan community. Males ages 1-20 years with TT were divided into two age groups: the pre-pubescent group ages 1-12 years and the post-pubescent group ages 13-20 years. A total of 286 patients were diagnosed with TT, including 208 (73%) post-pubescent males and 78 (27%) pre-pubescent males. There was a significant association between the pre- and post-pubescent patients and duration of TT symptoms (p=0.03). Of the 193 patients whose symptom duration was <24 hours, 148 (77%) were pre-pubescent compared to 45 (23%) who were post-pubescent. There was also a significant association between the two age groups and the type of surgery (p =0.001). The prevalence of orchiectomy in the younger group was 46.2% compared to 26.4% in the older group. Post-pubescent males had a 59% lower odds of undergoing an orchiectomy compared to pre-pubescent patients. The younger boys were 2.4 times more likely to have an orchiectomy compared to older boys. Among children treated for TT, pre-pubescent males are at a higher risk for orchiectomy than post-pubescent males. Higher levels of awareness, as well as prompt evaluation and surgical exploration, are needed to increase the rates of salvageable testes."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a time-sensitive urological emergency in which delays in diagnosis and treatment can lead to testicular loss. Despite advances in healthcare delivery, delayed presentation and management remain common worldwide and contribute to significant morbidity. This scoping review aimed to explore trends in presentation, diagnosis, and surgical management of testicular torsion across healthcare settings; identify and categorise the causes of delays; assess the impact of these delays on outcomes; highlight predictive factors influencing salvage; and map gaps in the literature to inform future research and interventions. The review was conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched for studies published between 2010 and 2025. Eligible studies were original peer-reviewed research articles reporting on delays, predictive factors, or outcomes of testicular torsion. Data were charted on study characteristics, delays, predictive factors, and surgical outcomes. Ten studies were included, representing 1,910 patients with acute scrotal pain, of whom 1,529 had confirmed torsion. Delays in presentation and diagnosis were multifactorial, arising from patient-related, diagnostic, and system-level barriers. Salvage rates varied from 12% to 82%, with an overall salvage rate of 41.5% and orchidectomy rate of 58.5%. Outcomes were closely linked to timing of surgery, with salvage highest within six hours of symptom onset and declining sharply thereafter. Predictive factors included symptom duration, degree of torsion, age, and imaging findings. None of the studies reported long-term functional outcomes. Delays remain the most important determinant of outcome in testicular torsion. Findings are consistent with international guidelines emphasising urgent exploration within six hours. Improved patient education, streamlined referral pathways, and institutional preparedness are essential to reduce preventable testicular loss. Future research should prioritise long-term outcomes and the evaluation of system-level interventions."

    "abstract": "Acute Scrotum (AS) is defined as pain associated with swelling and redness of the scrotum. This study investigates the hemogram and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) values obtained from patients diagnosed with AS, based on the hypothesis that blood parameters can be used as biomarkers in the diagnosis of Testicular Torsion (TT). The aim was to evaluate the predictability of these parameters in diagnosing AS in both pediatric and adult age groups. Demographic data and blood parameters including Hemoglobin (Hb), Platelet (PLT), CRP, and White Blood Cell (WBC) levels of patients who presented to our Emergency Department with the diagnosis of AS (TT, epididymitis, varicocele) and received medical and surgical treatment were analyzed. The importance of these parameters in diagnosis was assessed. A total of 26 patients were included in the study. The mean age of the cases was 15.8±3.6 years. 20 of the patients (76.9%) were in the pediatric age group, while 6 (23.1%) were in the adult age group. 93.1% (27) of the cases were unilateral, while 6.9% (2) had bilateral acute scrotum symptoms. The highest incidence of cases occurred in spring with 9 cases (31%), followed by winter and summer with 7 cases each (24.1%), and autumn with 6 cases (20.7%). Significant differences in age, platelet, and hemoglobin levels were observed between the pediatric and adult age groups. In conclusion, this study highlights significant age-related differences in the diagnosis and treatment of AS. The higher requirement for surgical intervention in pediatric patients further emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and timely intervention. However, further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to validate these findings and better understand the etiological differences. Additionally, a more specific analysis of blood parameters in subgroups (such as epididymitis, orchitis, TT) under the term \"acute scrotum\" may contribute to the literature."

Fibrotic bands around the epididymis/spermatic cord that can cause severe testicular ischemia are extremely rare. The origin of these bands is unknown. Although scrotal colour doppler ultrasonography (CDUS) has an important place in the diagnosis of TT, it may be insufficient in the diagnosis of the bands.

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is an emergency that can require orchiectomy if too much time passes between ischemia onset and surgery. This prospective, survey-based study demonstrates that there is poor understanding about torsion among boys, parents, and school nurses, and that a short, animated video could improve this knowledge gap and motivate early presentation to the hospital. After completing a survey about managing acute testicular pain, participants viewed a video ( https://share.vidyard.com/watch/7aKDRapNbeKrVzhdYrxton ) and answered follow-up questions. 670 parents, 376 school nurses, 43 boys, and 47 pediatricians completed the study. 45% of parents have never heard of torsion. Over half of the boys report they would wait before telling a parent about testicular pain. Less than half of school nurses say they would recommend a child's parents take him to the emergency department. Viewing an educational video improves awareness among boys, parents and school nurses that acute testicular pain needs to be evaluated and treated emergently. Testicular torsion is the most common urologic emergency in children, but most boys and their caregivers are unaware of the diagnosis. This leads to delays in care and higher rates of testicular loss. Many hospital initiatives have sought to decrease delays for boys with testicular torsion after they interact with the healthcare system, however, most time delay occurs prior to arrival at the hospital. This is the first study to demonstrate that patient and parent education can be more effective in taking efficient care of boys with acute testicular torsion."

    "abstract": "Introduction Testicular torsion is a urological emergency requiring prompt diagnosis and intervention to salvage testicular viability. The British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) and British Urology Researchers in Surgical Training (BURST) released consensus guidelines known as the Finding Consensus for Orchidopexy in Torsion (FIX-IT) study, to standardize scrotal explorations and improve clinical outcomes. This audit conducted at a district general hospital in Kent aimed to evaluate compliance with these guidelines - over two cycles, identifying areas for improvement. Methods A retrospective review of operation notes was conducted for all scrotal explorations performed in two distinct audit cycles in 2024. The first cycle, which spanned from January to June 2024, included a total of 16 cases. After completing the first cycle, a review in July 2024 highlighted areas for improvement. Based on this feedback, recommendations for practice improvements were made. The second cycle, conducted from August to December 2024, involved 38 cases, with data collection completed at the end of December. The data gathered for both cycles included the initial incision choice, intraoperative decision-making, fixation technique, closure methods, operation note documentation, and follow-up planning. These domains were then compared to the BURST-BAUS consensus guidelines to evaluate compliance and identify areas for improvement. Results A total of 54 scrotal explorations (16 in the first cycle and 38 in the second cycle) were reviewed across both audit cycles. The use of median raphe incisions was universal, with 100% compliance in both cycles. Fixation techniques were fully compliant with the guidelines, with non-absorbable sutures and three-point or four-point fixation being consistently used across both cycles. Closure techniques demonstrated 100% compliance, with all cases employing separate closure of the Dartos and skin layers using continuous and interrupted sutures, respectively, to optimize healing and minimize complications. However, intraoperative decision-making revealed notable divergence from the guidelines, particularly in non-torsion cases where orchidopexy was performed even in the absence of torsion or associated risk factors. In Cycle 1, all non-torsion cases (100%) underwent orchidopexy, whereas in Cycle 2, this was reduced (75%) but still persisted in a significant proportion of cases. Documentation of critical details (such as the degree of torsion and testicular appearance) and follow-up planning remained inconsistent but showed improvement between the two cycles. Conclusion The audit highlights substantial improvement between cycles, particularly in reducing inappropriate orchidopexy and planning follow-up. However, documentation gaps and residual guideline non-adherence indicate the need for ongoing education and standardization of scrotal exploration practice."

    "abstract": "Evaluation of fetal genitalia is often neglected after determining fetal sex, yet the identification of a scrotal mass may suggest significant underlying conditions requiring specific management. We conducted a systematic literature review, following PRISMA guidelines and registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024559035), on the five most common causes of prenatal scrotal masses: inguinoscrotal hernia (IH), meconium periorchitis (MPO), testicular solid tumors (TST), hydrocele (H), and testicular torsion (TT). A total of 83 cases were included (IH = 31; MPO = 23; TST = 6; H = 10; TT = 13), all diagnosed in the third trimester. IH typically presented as unilateral right-sided masses (63%), while MPO and H were predominantly bilateral (72% and 100%). TST and TT were mainly unilateral with no side preference. IH and MPO showed larger average diameters (> 35 mm). Additional findings were often associated with IH and MPO. MPO had the highest rates of preterm delivery (48%), neonatal medical support (40%), and urgent surgery (60.86%). IH and TST were usually associated with term deliveries and scheduled surgery (92.31% and 100%). TT showed a high incidence of urgent surgery (61.54%). This review outlines key sonographic features of prenatal scrotal masses to guide differential diagnosis and optimize perinatal care strategies."

    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Acute scrotal pain in children and adolescents requires prompt evaluation to differentiate testicular torsion from other scrotal pathologies. Testicular torsion, a surgical emergency, can lead to irreversible testicular damage if not managed rapidly. This study aims to assess the clinical signs, diagnostic tools, and outcomes related to testicular torsion in patients presenting with acute scrotal pain. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 111 patients diagnosed with acute scrotal conditions. Clinical signs, presentation times, ultrasound findings, and treatment outcomes (surgical intervention, orchiectomy, or medical management) were evaluated. The statistical analysis was performed with a p-value < 0.05 being considered significant. Correlations between clinical signs, diagnostic imaging, and treatment modalities were assessed. Results: The most prevalent clinical signs were scrotal swelling (92.2%), pain on palpation (93.5%), and scrotal hyperemia (84.4%). Testicular torsion was strongly associated with the absence of the cremasteric reflex (p < 0.0001) and testicular retraction (p < 0.0001). Ultrasound findings, including absent blood flow and testicular heterogeneity, were highly predictive of surgical intervention (p < 0.01). Patients presenting within 8 h of symptom onset had higher success rates of detorsion and testicular preservation. Conclusions: Timely and accurate clinical assessment, including the identification of key signs such as the absence of the cremasteric reflex and testicular retraction, is critical for differentiating testicular torsion from other conditions. Ultrasound findings are pivotal in guiding treatment decisions in cases of clinical uncertainty. Early intervention significantly improves testicular viability and outcomes, underscoring the importance of rapid diagnosis and management."

    "abstract": "Timely diagnosis and management of acute testicular torsion (ATT) is a benchmark for quality of care. We sought to evaluate whether patient sociodemographic factors and transfer status had an impact on hospital throughput and orchiectomy in ATT patients. From 1/1/2022 to 9/9/2023, patients were identified by CPT code for operations to treat ATT and confirmed by chart review. Patient demographics were noted, and socioeconomic status (SES) was estimated using a distress score produced via the Distressed Communities Index (DCI), a multidimensional measure of social context. We denoted patients who were transferred to our urban tertiary care children's hospital and tracked emergency department (ED) registration time, time of arrival in the operating room (OR), and whether a repeat scrotal ultrasound (SUS) was performed for transfer patients. Based on a quality improvement measurement framework, the time between ED and OR (i.e., hospital throughput) served as our process measure, and orchiectomy rate was our outcome measure. 100 patients were diagnosed with ATT at a median age of 14 years (IQR 12-15). Median time from ED to OR was 110 min (IQR 79-144). Sixty-one patients were transferred to our institution, and this cohort reflected a higher proportion of White, non-Hispanic patients (p = 0.04) with a lower median distress score (14.4 vs 36.8, p = 0.03). Obtaining a repeat SUS in 25 transfer patients (41 %) prolonged the time to OR by a median of 20 min (p < 0.01). Regardless of repeat SUS, transfer patients had faster hospital throughput than those patients who presented primarily to our institution (p < 0.01). Overall, the orchiectomy rate was 18 %, and this outcome was associated with younger patient age (p < 0.01) and longer reported duration of symptoms (p < 0.01). Transfer patients had a higher SES and experienced faster hospital throughput than patients presenting primarily to our institution. Repeating SUS in transfer patients added modestly to the time to OR but did not impact the likelihood of orchiectomy. In fact, neither transfer status nor sociodemographic factors, other than patient age, were associated with orchiectomy. Further research is needed to identify factors that affect testicular viability and what efforts might improve surgical outcomes. Patients with ATT transferred to our institution after presenting to a local hospital experienced prompt management with quicker time from ED to OR, though this did not impact their surgical outcome. Only younger patient age and longer reported duration of symptoms increased the likelihood of orchiectomy."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a urological emergency that occurs when the spermatic cord twists, cutting off blood supply to the testicle, and it requires immediate surgical intervention to prevent irreversible damage. Although it typically presents with sudden, severe scrotal pain and swelling, atypical presentations can complicate diagnosis and delay treatment. We report the case of a 25-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of left lower abdominal pain and left inguinal swelling. Despite the absence of testicular tenderness, scrotal ultrasound revealed reduced blood flow to the left testicle, raising suspicion for torsion. Emergency scrotal exploration confirmed a torsed spermatic cord, which was successfully detorsed, and the testicle was secured with orchidopexy. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged in good condition. This report highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for testicular torsion, even when symptoms deviate from the typical presentation, as early clinical recognition and prompt surgical intervention are essential to optimize outcomes and preserve testicular function."

We conducted a cross-sectional study of a nationally representative 20% sample of US EDs within the 2022 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample. We counted the number of child visits (less than 18 years old) at each ED for each of 24 serious pediatric emergency conditions and each ED's total across all conditions. We calculated the proportion of EDs that could reliably measure misdiagnosis rates at least 10% worse than condition-specific national reference standards. We also calculated the proportion of children visiting measurable EDs. Reliable misdiagnosis measurement across all serious conditions was possible in 614 out of 4,515 EDs (13.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 11.5 to 15.9). Appendicitis was the most reliably measurable condition (n=530 EDs, 11.7%, 95% CI 9.8 to 14.0), whereas complicated pneumonia (n=33, 0.7%, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.5), testicular torsion (n=29, 0.6%, 95% CI 0.2-1.4), and intussusception (n=25, 0.6%, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.2) were less frequently measurable. The 20 other included conditions were not reliably measurable in any ED (0.0%, 95% CI 0.0 to 0.4). Midwest, nonmetropolitan, and EDs evaluating less than 1,800 children per year were least likely to be able to support reliable measurement. Among 185,490 children with a serious condition, 130,894 (70.6%) visited an ED in which misdiagnosis was measurable. Few EDs have sufficient pediatric volumes to reliably measure diagnostic accuracy generally, and even fewer can do so for individual conditions. Aggregation of EDs could improve power to measure misdiagnosis."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a urological emergency that requires prompt surgery to prevent orchiectomy. Pharmacological interventions may slow the progression of damage and reduce reperfusion injury after surgical correction. This study evaluated the protective effects of linezolid against testicular torsion-detorsion (T/D) injury in rats by focusing on the mechanisms involving the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) pathway. Eighty-four male Wistar rats were allocated into 8 groups; of them, one was subjected to a sham operation and another was subjected to 4-hour ischemia via 720° of torsion followed by 24-hour reperfusion. Linezolid (3-100 mg/kg) was assessed for its effects on T/D injury using histopathological evaluation, oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde [MDA], superoxide dismutase [SOD]), and inflammatory biomarker tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Mechanistic investigations have focused on TLR-4 the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. Molecular docking and in silico analyses were conducted to predict interactions with key inflammatory proteins. Linezolid 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg significantly reduced the histopathological damage, with 50 mg/kg being the most effective dosage. Within the 6-50 mg/kg range, linezolid reduced MDA, increased SOD, decreased TNF-α, and suppressed TLR-4/NF-κB pathway activity, with maximal reductions in MDA, TNF-α, NF-κB, and TLR-4 of 64%, 77%, 56%, and 53%, respectively, and an enhancement in SOD of 47%. In silico docking predicted strong binding interactions with TLR-4 pathway proteins, including p38 MAPK and JNK, with affinities of -7.4 to -8.3 kcal/mol. Linezolid protects against testicular torsion by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation via modulating the TLR-4/NF-κB pathway, suggesting its therapeutic potential and need for further study."

Intra-operative finding was in keeping with torsion of the epididymal appendage as against the earlier clinical presentation suggestive of testicular torsion.

We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data on 134 cases of unilateral testicular torsion within 48 hours treated in our hospital by MD+S or by surgery alone from January 2015 to May 2022. We statistically analyzed the age distribution, and duration and degrees of testicular torsion, followed by comparison between the two groups. In the 134 cases, the median age of onset was 15 (13－19) years old, the median onset-to-visit time was 15 (8－25) hours, and the median degree of torsion was 360° (180°－1080°). Of the total number of patients, 21 underwent testicular excision and the other 113 were treated with the testis preserved, with no statistically significant difference in age distribution between the two groups (P>0.05), and a higher rate of testis resection in those with longer duration and greater angle of torsion (P<0.05). Totally, 33 of the patients were assigned to the MD+S group and 101 to the surgery alone group. According to the actual clinical conditions and excluding those with torsion time longer than 24 hours and torsion angle greater than 720 °, 28 of the patients underwent ultrasound-guided MD+S (with 1 case of testis resection, 3.6%), and 68 received surgery alone (with 7 cases of testis resection, 10.3%). The rate of testis resection was higher in the surgery alone than that in the MD+S group, but with no statistically significant difference between the two groups (P>0.05), which was considered to be related to the small sample size in this study. The popularization of testicular torsion knowledge can shorten the onset-to-visit time, and reasonable manual detorsion before emergency surgery can reduce the rate of testis resection."

    "abstract": "Timely surgical intervention for patients with testicular torsion is a quality benchmark set by the U.S. News and World Report (USNWR) for pediatric urology. In this study, we describe and evaluate a quality improvement initiative to reduce the time to surgical intervention for testicular torsion at a single institution through the implementation of a clinical care pathway called \"code torsion.\" Data abstraction was performed through retrospective chart review to assess process measures. Patients <21 years old with testicular torsion requiring surgical intervention were included. The clinical protocol \"code torsion\" was created by a multidisciplinary quality improvement workgroup with the primary goal of reducing the time from emergency department presentation to surgical intervention for testicular torsion. \"Code torsion\" was implemented in October 2021, which was assessed in addition to subsequent interventions through plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles. A total of 30 patients were identified prior to \"code torsion\" implementation and 14 thereafter. The mean time from triage to operating room (OR) was 228 min prior to \"code torsion\" compared with 180 min after protocol implementation (p = 0.047). The proportion of cases that had surgical intervention within the 4-h USNWR metric increased from 63% pre-protocol to 93% post-protocol (p = 0.07). Of the patients, 40% required orchiectomy prior to \"code torsion\" compared with 29% after implementation (p = 0.5). Patients requiring orchiectomy had a significantly longer time from symptom onset to surgical intervention (87 vs. 9.8 h, p < 0.001). Implementation of the protocol \"code torsion\" was successful in reducing the time from presentation to surgical intervention for testicular torsion. The rates of testicular salvage did not differ after \"code torsion\" implementation and were instead found to be dependent on the total ischemia time."

Early diagnosis and intervention are essential to prevent testicular ischemia. Due to the continuity between the retroperitoneum and the scrotum via the processus vaginalis and inguinal canal, blood from an adrenal haemorrhage may track down into the scrotum, leading to swelling and discoloration.  We report a case of a 1-day-old male neonate born via emergency caesarean section at 37 weeks due to foetal distress. The baby initially admitted to the NICU for transient tachypnoea, developed a right hemi-scrotal swelling with bluish discoloration on the second day of life. Scrotal ultrasound suggested testicular torsion, but Doppler imaging showed absent blood flow. Further abdominal ultrasound confirmed a right adrenal haemorrhage. The neonate was managed conservatively with intravenous fluids, antibiotics, oxygen support, and coagulation management. Serial ultrasounds showed gradual resolution, and he was discharged on the 17th postnatal day. Follow-up at 1 and 3 months showed complete recovery with normal growth.  Neonatal adrenal haemorrhage should be considered in cases of acute scrotum, especially in neonates with birth asphyxia. Abdominal ultrasound can aid in diagnosis, preventing diagnostic delays, unnecessary surgery, and anaesthesia exposure. This case highlights the importance of thorough imaging and awareness of rare differential diagnoses, contributing to improved clinical practice and better neonatal outcomes."

    "title": "Atypical Testicular Torsion Due to an Epididymal Cyst in a Young Adult: Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Acute scrotal pain is a urological emergency. Testicular torsion (TT) is a surgical emergency that compromises rapidly testicular viability. There is approximately a 4- to 8-hour window from the onset of torsion symptoms until surgical intervention is required to save the affected testis. Delays in care may necessitate orchiectomy, which has been associated with reduced fertility. It can occur at any age, with two peaks of frequency: during the first years of life and at puberty. The causes of testicular torsion are multiple and are related to a defect in the fixation system of the testicle. Here we report an unusual situation of testicular torsion induced by a large epididymal cyst in a young adult. The cyst was excised as well as bilateral testicular fixation and the patient was discharged on the third day. Clinical examinations and Doppler ultrasound at the sixth and twelfth postoperative weeks were both normal. This observation leads us to consider epididymal cysts as a risk factor for TT."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency. We have observed that mass-like epididymal enlargement and morphologic changes to the testicular parenchyma differentially represent testes that are viable versus non-viable at the time of scrotal exploration. The purpose of this study is to assess sonographic findings that may help predict the viability of torsed testes at the time of scrotal exploration. We retrospectively reviewed 128 scrotal ultrasound exams of surgically confirmed testicular torsions (88 salvageable, 40 non-salvageable) from July 2022 to July 2023 (mean age 13.1 years, range: 1-19 years). We assessed the visibility of the mediastinum testis, the ratio between affected and non-affected testes of the maximal cross-sectional area of the epididymis on a transverse plane, the ratio between affected and non-affected testes of the testicular volume, and subjective evidence of mass-like epididymal enlargement. Patients with global epididymal enlargement and those with a non-visible mediastinum testis were found to have a statistically higher likelihood of non-salvageable testes (p = 0.0123 and p = 0.0208, respectively). Additionally, a significant association was observed between testicular volume symmetry and the viability of torsed testes (p = 0.0013). Notably, when the volume of the torsed testis exceeded that of the normal contralateral testis by 40 %, it was significantly associated with a non-salvageable outcome (p = 0.0132). Sonographically visible mediastinum testis, absence of epididymal tail enlargement, and similar volume between affected and non-affected testes are potential positive predictors of the viability of the pediatric torsed testes found during emergent testicular salvage surgery. In contrast, the absence of these predictors suggests a non-salvageable testis."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a time-sensitive urologic emergency that requires prompt intervention to preserve testicular function. Previous studies have investigated orchiectomy rates in association with social determinants of health (SDoHs) and found that those without private insurance and Black individuals have higher rates of orchiectomy following testicular torsion. However, there is limited data regarding the impact of SDoHs and time to presentation to a healthcare facility for pediatric patients with testicular torsion. We conducted a retrospective chart review of pediatric patients with testicular torsion between 2013 and 2022. Patients were excluded from the study if they were 18 and older, less than one month old, did not have documented time of symptom onset, or did not receive urgent surgical treatment at our facility. Time to presentation and surgical outcome was analyzed in association with race, ethnicity, use of interpreter and insurance status. A total of 253 pediatric patients with a median age of 13.9 years were included in the study. There was no significant relationship between ethnicity, race and use of an interpreter and time to presentation. However, patients with public insurance had a longer time to presentation (11.5 h, IQR 3.9-49.3) when compared to those with private insurance and (4.9 h, IQR 2.75-26.2, p = 0.004). There was no relationship between race, Hispanic and non-Hispanic ethnicity, use of an interpreter and insurance status with orchiectomy rates. This study found that within the pediatric population, public insurance status predicted longer time to presentation for patients presenting with testicular torsion. This highlights the importance of access to healthcare facilities for those presenting with testicular torsion. Further work is needed to identify modifiable barriers to presentations in care for testicular torsion."

The pain was sharp in nature, described like a severe cramp which started 10 hours prior to presentation, progressively increasing over time. He denied any recent trauma or infective symptoms, and there were no other associated complaints. On physical examination, he was in tears due to excruciating pain which he could not locate precisely, had tense muscles at the right posterior upper thigh and lower gluteal area and had limping. Also, he had mild right testicular tenderness on examination which he did not complain of before, no skin changes or swelling with normal cremasteric reflex. His investigations were significant for asymmetric ischiopubic synchondrosis on pelvic X-ray. Scrotal ultrasound showed no evidence of testicular torsion. Pelvic MRI showed features consistent with the right ischiopubic synchondrosis osteomyelitis. He spiked a high-grade fever of 40°C within 24 hours of presentation. His blood culture grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus On admission, he was managed initially with ceftriaxone, vancomycin and clindamycin. After the blood culture result, he received ceftriaxone for 2 weeks, followed by oral cefuroxime for another 2 weeks. Pain controlled with ketorolac and paracetamol.

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a pediatric emergency that poses a time-sensitive risk to the testicle. Best practices for testicular torsion protocols remain unclear. We convened the Testicular Torsion Collaborative, leveraging National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Pediatric (NSQIPP) Testicular Torsion Process Measure collection to assess factors associated with favorable metrics. Data were accrued across 29 participating NSQIPP sites, excluding neonatal and non-urgent cases. Post-processed data available through NSQIPP included site of initial presentation and time stamps for presentation, ultrasound, and operating room entry; number of cases greater than the NSQIPP median for each time stamp; and orchiectomy rate. Hospital level data and torsion-related care processes were collected from each participating site via an electronic survey. From 10/1/2021 to 9/30/22, 1007 testicular torsion patients were included, with 494 (49.1 %) transferred from another institutions. A standardized evaluation protocol was associated with fewer patients exceeding the NSQIPP median from presentation to ultrasound (38.8 % vs 60 %, p = 0.03). Testicular Workup for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion (TWIST) score use was associated with a shorter time frame from presentation to ultrasound (0.7 vs 1.1 h, p = 0.03). Free-standing children's hospitals (p > 0.01) and institutions with an American College of Surgeons Children's Surgery Verification (p = 0.03) also demonstrated improved time to ultrasound. Overall orchiectomy rate was 15.8 % and there were no statistical differences noted across the study variables. Across a wide spectrum of hospitals within NSQIPP, we demonstrate that certain torsion-related processes and hospital-level factors are associated with faster times to ultrasound. The NSQIPP Testicular Torsion Collaborative will continue to explore interventions to improve testicular torsion care and outcomes."

    "title": "Pathophysiology and impact of testicular torsion/detorsion on male reproduction: Therapeutic approach with some phytochemicals.",
    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a typical urologic emergency that occurs when the spermatic cord twists and impairs blood flow to the testicles. It results in hypoxia, oxidative stress, inflammation, and ultimately fetal harm and apoptosis. It takes a pathologist's quick diagnosis and surgical action to save fetal function. Reperfusion following extended ischemia exacerbates inflammation and oxidative damage, making germ-cell apoptosis more difficult. Several complicated signaling pathways, including neutrophil activation, endothelial dysfunction, cytokine release, and stress-related gene expression, contribute to germ cell death, followed by subfertility or sterility. Many phytochemicals have shown promising potential in experimental models to counteract some pathophysiological mechanisms. This article reviews the complex pathophysiology caused by reflow, the resulting disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, and the adverse effects on male fertility. The therapeutic implications of some bioactive phytochemicals as potential contributors to preserving testicular viability are also discussed to explore their roles. They determine the scope for well-designed clinical research. This may pave the way for combination therapy to improve outcomes and preserve fertility in cases of testicular torsion."

    "title": "Higher rates of orchiectomy in testicular torsion are associated with substandard health literacy.",
    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is an emergency that may result in orchiectomy if not addressed promptly. Orchiectomy rates approach 40 % when presentation is delayed more than 12 h. Pediatric emergency department (ED) protocols to triage acute scrotal pain have mitigated system-based delays to treatment. Despite these initiatives, high rates of orchiectomy remain, likely due to delayed presentation to the ED. In the United States, 12 % of adults have proficient health literacy, defined as the ability to use information and services to inform health-related decisions. We hypothesize that patients from areas with low health literacy are associated with higher rates of orchiectomy. An administrative billing database was queried from October 2015 to March 2023 to identify patients with acute intravaginal testicular torsion that underwent orchiectomy and contralateral orchidopexy (OCO) or bilateral orchidopexy (BO). Patients under 8 years old were excluded. Demographic information and the distance from the patient's home to the hospital was collected. Health literacy estimates were obtained from University of North Carolina health literacy map. Average health literacy estimates were categorized into quartiles. 2019 Social deprivation index (SDI) information by zip code was assigned to each patient. 1044 patients underwent surgery for testicular torsion,942 patients met all clinical inclusion criteria, and of those 841 had available health literacy data. In this cohort, 275 patients (32.7 %) underwent OCO, and 566 (67.3 %) underwent BO. Median age at surgery was 14.2 ± 1.89 years for the OCO group and 13.8 ± 2.0 for the BO group (p = 0.012). Average health literacy per zip code for OCO group was 239.17 ± 11.25 and 241.6 ± 12.5 for the BO group (p < 0.05). Of the patients who underwent OCO, 74.1 % patients came from zip codes with the lowest 2 quartiles of health literacy compared to 64.9 % in the BO group (p < 0.001). Lower health literacy and >50 miles from the hospital were significantly associated with an increased risk of OCO. There was no significant difference between the OCO and BO groups regarding urban, suburban, rural zip codes, insurance status, or SDI quartile. Quality improvement initiatives have been implemented to minimize time from ED presentation to surgery. However, patient-related factors significantly contribute to outcomes. Our study reveals a correlation between lower rates of health literacy and increased rates of orchiectomy. By analyzing data on specific zip codes, targeted education plans can help to improve health literacy and knowledge of testicular torsion to continuously decrease orchiectomy rates in cases of testicular torsion."

    "title": "Testicular torsion after laparoscopic appendectomy: salvage by spermatic cord heparin flush and testicular decompression - a case report and literature review.",
    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is defined as an acute scrotal emergency that occurs in adolescents. It requires intervention within 6 h to avoid necrosis due to ischemia of the testis caused by seminal torsion. The etiology of testicular torsion is mostly associated with anatomical abnormalities, such as pendulum malformation. The clinical presentation is characterized by sudden onset of scrotal pain. Ultrasound is used in combination with the TWIST scoring system to improve diagnostic accuracy. Early surgical exploration is central to treatment; however, delayed diagnosis and treatment lead to an orchiectomy rate of up to 71%. Perioperative pain, inflammatory irritation, or prolonged bed rest may induce torsion; however, reports of postoperative secondary testicular torsion are rare and require clinical vigilance. A 14-year-old male patient presented with sudden onset of right scrotal swelling and pain 24 h after undergoing laparoscopic surgery for acute appendicitis. A detailed ultrasonographic examination revealed a significant reduction in blood flow to the patient's right testis, leading to a diagnosis of 720° testicular torsion with infarction. The patient's family expressed a preference for preservation of the testis, and thus, following sodium heparinisation of the spermatic cord, the incision of testicular tunica albuginea was performed to achieve testicular decompression. Postoperative and intraoperative evaluations demonstrated restoration of blood flow. However, a 3-month follow-up revealed atrophy of the affected testis (1.9 × 1.3 × 1.1 cm) with a 55% reduction in size. This rare instance of postoperative testicular torsion underscores the necessity for enhanced perioperative monitoring of the genital region, particularly in cases involving anatomical abnormalities and risk factors. Despite the short-term benefits of innovative interventions in improving blood supply, the resultant ischemia-reperfusion injury led to irreversible atrophy. Combining ultrasound with TWIST scoring has been shown to enhance the diagnostic process; however, its sensitivity to early torsion remains limited, necessitating vigilance for dynamic changes. The preservation of the necrotic testis has been demonstrated to reduce psychological stress; however, the long-term risks of atrophy, infertility, and malignancy require adequate information about prognosis."

    "abstract": "Epididymo-orchitis (EO) is rare in infants, and associated hydrocele at presentation indicates an advanced stage of infection. It is commonly associated with urinary tract infection (UTI) and can be a clue to the presence of underlying congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract. Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency that can mimic EO and should be ruled out at presentation. Here, we present a six-month-old male infant who was brought in with complaints of passage of pinkish urine, pus discharge per urethra for two days, and fever for one day. He also had a history of excessive crying during micturition for the past seven days. On examination, he was febrile, and head-to-toe examination revealed an acute left scrotum with hydrocele. Prehn's sign was negative on the left side, and the cremasteric reflex was absent bilaterally. Urinalysis was ordered along with culture, which showed plenty of pus cells and a few red blood cells. Ultrasound with Doppler (USG Doppler) was done immediately, which ruled out torsion and hernia but showed an inflamed epididymis and left mild hydronephrosis (HDN) with trabeculated bladder wall and internal echoes. The infant was started on intravenous (IV) antibiotics for suspected UTI with poor oral intake, and he promptly improved in the next 48 hours. Urine culture grew Escherichia coli, and an antibiotic course was given for 10 days. A follow-up micturating cystourethrogram (MCU) revealed grade III left side vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), for which he was started on antibiotic prophylaxis, and his technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (Tc-99m DMSA) scan was normal. He is currently under periodic follow-up for his VUR. This case emphasizes the timely detection of complicated UTIs in infants. Torsion should always be ruled out in infants presenting with acute scrotum."

MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched on 05 January 2025 using the outlined search strategy. 67 unique papers were found and screened for relevance. 13 relevant papers were identified. Study information, participant group, relevant outcomes and study weaknesses were extracted from each paper and presented in a table. Results revealed up to 100% of patients with TT had an absent cremasteric reflex; however, due to small sample sizes, there was wide variation in sensitivities (21-100%) between the papers. Small sample sizes and the inclusion of retrospective studies were significant limitations within this paper. The clinical bottom line proposes that although an absent cremasteric reflex is common in TT, the presence of a cremasteric reflex cannot be used to rule out TT."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency requiring rapid diagnosis and treatment to prevent testicular loss. However, other conditions, such as hemorrhagic epididymal cyst rupture, can mimic its presentation, posing diagnostic challenges. A 25-year-old male presented with sudden, severe right scrotal pain. Examination revealed a tender superior epididymal mass. Scrotal ultrasound showed homogeneous fluid collection with normal testicular blood flow. Due to severe pain, surgical exploration ruled out torsion and confirmed a hemorrhagic epididymal cyst, which was excised intact. Distinguishing testicular torsion from hemorrhagic epididymal cyst rupture is crucial. Doppler ultrasound remains the primary diagnostic tool, with torsion showing absent blood flow, whereas cysts maintain normal or increased vascularization. In unclear cases, surgical exploration is justified to prevent testicular loss. Although testicular torsion is the most critical cause of acute scrotal pain, alternative diagnoses, such as hemorrhagic epididymal cyst rupture, should be considered. Prompt diagnosis using clinical evaluation and imaging can prevent unnecessary orchiectomy, with surgical exploration remaining the safest option in uncertain cases."

If not treated promptly, TT can result in testicular atrophy and infertility. While early surgical intervention restores blood flow, the long-term impact on fertility remains a concern. This study investigates the role of strain elastography (SE) and testicular volume measurements in assessing testicular function after TT. To evaluate the importance of strain elastography and testicular volume measurements in the long-term fertility assessment of adolescent patients who underwent surgery for TT. This retrospective observational study included 15 patients operated on for TT between 2014 and 2020. Data on patient demographics, age at surgery, torsion laterality, symptom duration, degree of torsion, follow-up period, and semen analysis results were collected. SE and testicular volume measurements were performed during follow-up. Patients were classified as fertile or subfertile based on semen analysis. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS, including independent sample t-tests and Pearson correlation analysis. The volume of the torsed testis was significantly reduced compared to the contralateral testis (p = 0.0001). In the fertile group, there was a strong correlation between the affected and contralateral testis elastography values (r = 0.948), whereas this correlation was weak in the subfertile group (r = 0.158). The results suggest that in the fertile group, both testicles exhibited similar elastographic changes, while in the subfertile group, the affected testis showed independent variations. This study highlights the importance of strain elastography and testicular volume measurements in the long-term assessment of fertility following TT. These techniques provide valuable insights into testicular function and potential fertility. Further research with larger cohorts and extended follow-up is needed to validate these findings."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a common urological emergency that affects children and young males and requires immediate surgical intervention and adequate management, or it may lead to male subfertility and infertility with remote effects on vital organs including the heart. To date, there has been no sufficient treatment for these cases, and further studies are highly recommended. Thus, our study aimed to evaluate the effect of sacubitril/valsartan (SV) on testicular ischaemia/reperfusion (TIR)-induced testicular damage and remote cardiac effect in juvenile rats. Forty juvenile Wistar albino rats were divided into five groups (n = 8) as control; SV (60 mg kg-1); TIR-induced group; TIR plus SV low-dose (30 mg kg-1); TIR plus SV high-dose (60 mg kg-1). TIR induced testicular injury with remote cardiac effects, as we found a significant decrease in serum testosterone, increased cardiac enzyme levels and marked disturbances in oxidative stress parameters. Moreover, there are increases in angiotensin II (Ang II), neprilysin and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1). In addition, there is a disturbance in phosphor-nuclear factor kappa B (p-NF-κB p65), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4) and cleaved caspase 3 with abnormal histological features. However, SV co-administration reversed damaging effect of TIR by regulating the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), and anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-apoptotic pharmacological and physiological properties, and by modulation of different pathways. SV has protective properties against TIR-induced damage."

    "abstract": "Pediatric testicular torsion (PedTT) is a surgical emergency that requires prompt presentation. Delay in intervention can lead to testicular loss. In the PedTT care pathway, the pre-hospital phase prior to presenting to the emergency department, is the strongest determining factor for testicular salvage. Although the severe nature of testicular pain is likely to prompt many families to seek emergent care, patients with milder symptoms may delay presentation if they and their caregivers are unaware of PedTT as a disease entity. Understanding caregiver and pediatric knowledge of PedTT will aid in better designing and delivering educational initiatives to reduce pre-hospital delay and improve testicular salvage. This study is a comprehensive scoping review of the literature reporting on pediatric and caregiver knowledge of PedTT, and outcomes of educational initiatives. A scoping review was performed on all English-language literature reporting on pediatric and caregiver knowledge of PedTT, as well as PedTT-based educational initiatives. Both qualitative and quantitative studies were reviewed, analyzed, and compiled. A total of 2773 articles were identified, with 21 studies included. After review, 11 studies focused on caregiver perspectives of PedTT, 5 studies examined patient perspectives, and 8 studies identified PedTT educational initiatives, with overlap between publications. Overall, knowledge gaps were identified in the definition of PedTT, presenting symptoms, and critical time frame for salvage by both pediatric and caregiver groups. Caregivers expressed a need and a desire for increased public awareness and teaching around PedTT. School-based educational initiatives were well-received among participants, with social media-based initiatives showing promise. Both pediatric and caregiver knowledge of PedTT is low, and lack of awareness may contribute to delayed presentation. Educational initiatives have been shown to improve PedTT knowledge and awareness. Results from this study can be used to optimize PedTT educational efforts to improve caregiver and public knowledge."

This report describes two cases of acute epididymitis in infants, emphasizing the importance of differential diagnosis in the emergency department. In case 1, a six-month-old male infant with swelling and erythema extending from the right groin to the scrotum was initially suspected of having a strangulated inguinal hernia. However, scrotal ultrasonography and urinalysis confirmed an acute epididymitis, and the patient responded well to antibiotics. In case 2, a three-month-old male infant with scrotal erythema and swelling required surgical exploration to rule out testicular torsion and was ultimately diagnosed with acute epididymitis. The patient was cured with antibiotics without relapsing. This report underscores the role of clinical evaluation, scrotal ultrasound, and laboratory tests such as urinalysis and serum C-reactive protein levels in diagnosing epididymitis and differentiating it from other acute scrotal conditions. However, surgical exploration is a useful diagnostic tool for acute infantile epididymitis. Early and accurate diagnosis of acute epididymitis using these examinations is crucial for preventing long-term complications."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion, a critical urological emergency caused by twisting of the spermatic cord, poses a risk of ischemia, particularly in children who often struggle to pinpoint symptoms onset. Delay in managing testicular torsion can lead to the need for orchiectomy. The aim of this study was to assess the association between hematologic parameters-mean platelet volume (MPV), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and C-reactive protein (CRP)-and testicular salvage in cases of testicular torsion. Four databases (PubMed, Embase (Ovid), Science Direct, and Scopus) were systematically searched for eligible studies published up to November 4, 2024. The primary outcome was testicular salvage. Sensitivity analysis was performed using leave- one-out plot. Subgroup analysis was performed based on age, country, region, duration to orchiopexy and duration to orchiectomy. Heterogeneity was examined using I 2 statistics, and a random-effect model was applied. Out of 363 studies identified, nine observational studies involving 796 patients were included, with 338 (42.3%) in orchiopexy group. The meta-analysis indicated that MPV value was significantly elevated in orchiectomy group (mean difference (MD): -0.4; 95% confidence interval (95%CI): -0.62-(-0.18); p < 0.01), with higher MPV levels associated with an increased likelihood of orchiectomy (odds ratio (OR): 2.12; 95%CI: 1.35-3.33; p < 0.01). NLR, PLR, and CRP showed no significant association with testicular salvage, as demonstrated by pooled MD and OR analyses (p > 0.05). No significant differences were observed after sensitivity and subgroup analysis (p > 0.05). These findings suggest that elevated MPV levels are associated with non- salvageable testis, requiring orchiectomy highlighting its potential utility in clinical evaluation for testicular torsion."

Orchiectomy is one of the severe complications of this condition, and accurately predicting its risk is of great significance for clinical decision-making. This study aims to develop a nomogram to predict risk factors for orchiectomy after TT in children. This study retrospectively collected clinical data from 327 cases of TT at the Children's Hospital of Fudan University and 141 cases at Anhui Provincial Children's Hospital, which were classified into the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of orchiectomy in TT patients, and a nomogram was constructed. The model's effectiveness in both the training and validation cohorts was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). A total of 468 cases were included, of which 230 (49.15%) ultimately underwent orchiectomy. Duration of symptoms, neutrophil count, eosinophil count, degree of torsion, undescended testis(UDT), Testicular Workup for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion(TWIST) score grading, and ultrasound blood flow signal were identified as independent risk factors for orchiectomy in children with TT and were used to construct the nomogram. The AUCs of the nomogram were 0.93 (95% CI: 0.91-0.96) in the training cohort and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.79-0.92) in the validation cohort. The calibration curves demonstrated good agreement between predicted and observed values, and DCA indicated that the constructed nomogram had a high clinical net benefit. The nomogram developed in this study effectively predicts the risk of orchiectomy after TT in children, providing clinicians with a valuable decision-making tool. Future multicenter clinical studies are needed to optimize and validate the model's effectiveness."

Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics and multivariate regression. Of 9594 appendix ultrasounds, 20.4 % were nurse-initiated, reducing LOS by 12.7 % (p < 0.001). Of 2525 testicular ultrasounds, 41.9 % were TNIO, reducing LOS by 6.4 % (p < 0.001). TNIO for appendicitis reduced time to antibiotics by 11.9 % (p < 0.001) but had no effect on time to pain control. TNIO patients had fewer return visits (p < 0.001) but higher rates of departures prior to provider evaluation (p < 0.001). Disparities were observed, with Non-Hispanic Black and Medicaid patients less likely to receive TNIO for appendicitis. Triage nurse-initiated ultrasounds reduce LOS in cases of suspected appendicitis and testicular torsion. Implementing triage nurse-initiated imaging protocols could potentially optimize the care of pediatric patients with these conditions, ultimately improving ED efficiency."

    "abstract": "Testicular fibrosis is a common complication in testicular torsion cases, resulting in infertility. This paper reveals the alleviated role of an ER protein TXNDC5 in ischemia/reperfusion-induced testicular fibrosis mouse model, providing its therapeutic potential. Testicular torsion is a urological emergency. Delayed diagnosis and treatment hamper the testicular salvage rate and the subsequent recovery of the fertility. Although detorsion surgery restores the testicular blood flow, the process of torsion/detorsion leads to ischemia/reperfusion injury, which aggravates the primary damage due to the excessive generation of free radicals that disrupt antioxidant homeostasis. In the present study, we investigated the role of endoplasmic reticulum protein, thioredoxin domain-containing protein 5, in ischemia/reperfusion-induced testicular fibrosis. We showed that apart from disrupted testicular structure, elevated transforming growth factor beta 1, alpha-smooth muscle actin and collagen type 1 protein expression accompanied by TXNDC5 upregulation were detected in mice that underwent ischemia/reperfusion injury. By Txndc5 deletion, fibrosis, redox oxidation and extracellular matrix-associated signaling pathways and their accompanied genes/proteins were downregulated, indicating amelioration of testicular tissue damage and fibrosis in Txndc5-/- mice. With the apparent restoration of testicular structure and spermatogenesis, our study provides a potential therapeutic strategy by targeting TXNDC5 in testicular torsion patients to reduce ischemia/reperfusion-induced testicular fibrosis and to restore their fertility."

    "abstract": "Acute scrotum poses diagnostic challenges due to its diverse etiology and potential severity. Multiparametric ultrasound has proven to be a fundamental and valuable imaging modality in this context, improving early-phase sensitivity through various techniques, including B-Mode, color Doppler, power Doppler, pulsed Doppler, microflow studies, and elastography. In this context, Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) emerges as a rapid, safe, and valuable tool in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic decisions for acute scrotal conditions. This study involves a detailed analysis of various ultrasound imaging techniques and investigates the optimal circumstances and methods for employing CEUS in emergency situations to improve diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic decisions. Multiparametric ultrasound plays a crucial role in diagnosing various pathologies, including testicular torsion, appendage torsion, inflammation, ischemia/infarction, and trauma. CEUS provides real-time assessment of vascular perfusion, aiding in early diagnosis and accurate characterization of scrotal pathologies and significantly reducing the need for unnecessary surgical interventions, especially in trauma cases. Its role in differentiating between various pathologies and guiding therapeutic decisions underscores its importance in clinical practice, contributing significantly to improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a time-sensitive urological emergency characterized by twisting of the spermatic cord, leading to ischaemia and, if untreated, necrosis. Young males under 25 are at the highest risk due to congenital defects like the Bell Clapper deformity. Prompt diagnosis and management are crucial. A 30-year-old male presented with severe right testicular pain, and point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in the Emergency Department confirmed torsion within a few minutes upon arrival to Emergency Department. Manual detorsion restored blood flow, confirmed by bedside Doppler imaging using POCUS within 15 min of arrival. The patient underwent successful bilateral orchidopexy. This case emphasizes the importance of early targeted emergency POCUS in recognizing and managing testicular torsion, ensuring optimal outcomes."

Registration of parameters included symptoms, durations, ultrasound conclusions, and surgical outcome. Ultrasound assessment included inspection of the spermatic cord and testicular color Doppler signal. Sensitivity and specificity were presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and symptoms with odds ratios (ORs).ResultsA total of 387 patients were included. Surgical exploration (SE) was carried out in 40 patients. TT was surgically confirmed in 23 patients. No missed cases of TT were detected. Spermatic cord rotation ≥180° showed a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI=86-100), specificity of 65% (95% CI=41-83), positive predictive value (PPV) of 79%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%. Absent or reduced testicular color Doppler signal showed a sensitivity of 57% (95% CI=37-74), specificity of 77% (95% CI=53-90), PPV of 76%, and NPV of 57%. Sudden onset of pain (OR=9.44, 95% CI=2.10-42.35), earlier similar episodes (OR=6.71, 95% CI=2.27-19.89), and abdominal pain (OR=14.70, 95% CI=3.25-66.51) showed significant association with TT.ConclusionUltrasound, with focus on the spermatic cord, is reliable as a tool for the detection of TT. SE might be justified when cord rotation is ≥180°. These results can be used to develop and validate ultrasound guidelines for fast detection."

Our secondary objective was to create and compare a new TT score [Testicular Emergency Score for Torsion (TEST) score]. This was a multicenter prospective study in 21 Spanish pediatric emergency departments between 2020 and 2022, including 903 children 3 months to 18 years old with non-traumatic unilateral testicular pain, of them 93 TT (10.3%). To create a new score, the sample was randomly divided into derivation and validation set. The performance of the TWIST, TT score, AIS, and BALS was good, and the proportion of patients correctly classified as low risk was 37.9%, 52.7%, 30.3%, and 28%, respectively. The TEST score included the following predictors of TT identified by multivariable logistic regression analysis: age, duration of pain, nausea/vomiting, testicular volume increase, testicular elevation, induration, and absence of cremasteric reflex. TEST score had a higher area under the receiver operating curve (area under the curve) and correctly classified in the low-risk group of 63.6% of the patients. Although TWIST, TT score, BALS, and AIS scores showed a good performance, the TEST score identifies a larger group of low-risk patients suitable for safe management without Doppler ultrasound."

    "abstract": "Pediatric gonadal torsion is a critical surgical emergency requiring immediate diagnosis and intervention to preserve reproductive capabilities. This review addresses the diagnostic challenges, imaging patterns, and management strategies for both ovarian and testicular torsion, including a brief discussion on the emerging role of Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS), therefore filling a significant gap in the literature. We emphasize the need for a high index of suspicion due to often nonspecific clinical presentations, particularly in ovarian torsion. An accurate and swift diagnosis allows conservative surgical intervention to be offered, which is crucial to maximize gonadal salvage and minimize recurrence. While we highlight CEUS's potential benefits in enhancing diagnostic clarity without ionizing radiation, ultrasound and other modalities such as MRI and CT, have a paramount role in this setting. Future research comparing CEUS with MRI is essential to validate its diagnostic accuracy and effectiveness, potentially revolutionizing acute care diagnostics. Incorporating CEUS into diagnostic workflows, along with a deep understanding of the condition's epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical presentation, may probably significantly improve patient outcomes. We detail the characteristic imaging features, diagnostic pitfalls, and differential diagnoses essential for radiologists, with particular relevance for residents and those with limited pediatric radiology exposure. This review aims to bridge existing knowledge gaps and serve as a robust educational tool, facilitating better clinical decision-making and outcomes in pediatric gonadal torsion cases."

A short systematic review was conducted to evaluate the question: in patients presenting with acute unilateral testicular pain, is a negative Prehn's sign an accurate sign for diagnosis of testicular torsion (TT)?Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched using the OVID interface from inception to 26 February 2025. Following the removal of duplicates, the search strategy yielded a total of 11 papers. Study information, participant group, relevant outcomes and study weaknesses were extracted from each article.Four studies addressed the three-part question. The only study that had the full text available for review found that 33% of patients with TT had a positive Prehn's sign, which equated to an OR of 5.941 (95% CI 1.432 to 24.658). Of the three remaining retrospective cohort studies, Prehn's sign was reported to be positive in 10.5%, 37.5% and 100% of patients with TT, respectively. Therefore, the negativity of Prehn's sign ranged from 0% to 89.5% in patients with TT.The clinical bottom line is that Prehn's sign is insufficiently sensitive to rule out TT; however, its negativity increases the likelihood of a TT diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a time-critical emergency, though its incidence in the paediatric age group is relatively rare. Changes in training pathways have led to a decreasing number of adult general surgical and urological trainees being comfortable in performing an emergency scrotal exploration in children, resulting in children being transferred to regional units with the requisite expertise. This delay has been shown to increase the risk of orchidectomy. There is, therefore, an increased emphasis on the diagnostic evaluation of these children by emergency department staff. We explore how lack of experience and availability of appropriate investigations led to transfer of children presenting to a district general hospital in the North East of England. Children with true testicular torsion in this cohort had an unacceptably high rate of needing an orchidectomy (∼67%) compared with the reported incidence of orchidectomy with testicular torsion (∼20%). We offer potential solutions to the hurdles that have to be overcome to improve this service. This will align the service to the recently published Get It Right First Time report on the management of testicular torsion in children and young adults and is within the remit of Operational Delivery Networks."

Ceratonia siliqua is known to decrease oxidative stress in urological pathologies. We investigated the protective effects of C. siliqua against I/R injury. Wistar rats (n = 28) were divided into control, i.p. C. siliqua injected, I/R injury group, and C. siliqua injected each day for a week after I/R groups. They were morphologically evaluated with light and electron microscopy, and Caspase-3, Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1), CD68, Superoxide dismutase (SOD), and Catalase antibodies were marked. Oxidative stress markers of Glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) from tissue and levels of testosterone, Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and inhibin-B from blood samples were examined. C.siliqua treatment preserved tissue integrity (p < 0.0001) and Leydig cells and decreased apoptotic (p = 0.0390) and necrotic changes when compared with the I/R group. The I/R group presented mitochondrial damage, intercellular edema, and vacuolization. Oxidative stress was less with treatment, but hormone levels were unchanged. C.siliqua preserved the testicular tissue against I/R-induced damage. The decreased apoptosis may have been caused by the significant oxidative stress protection properties of C.siliqua. One week of treatment with C.siliqua protected Leydig cell morphology but did not change hormone parameters in the rat model. The therapeutic effect of C.siliqua is promising for clinical use in testis torsion cases."

    "abstract": "Ultrasound of the scrotum plays a crucial role in assessing acute scrotal conditions in the Emergency Department. Although the Emergency Physician and Intensivist have shared responsibility for the care of the critically ill patient, the Emergency Physician typically uses Point-of-care Ultrasound in a broader range of applications than the intensivist to include advanced abdominal, obstetric, testicular, musculoskeletal, and ocular ultrasonography. Acute scrotum refers to the sudden onset of scrotal erythema, swelling, or pain, and it is not a rare condition in the Emergency Department. Prompt intervention is required in cases of testicular torsion or rupture, and ultrasound of the scrotum has high utility for emergency physicians seeing acute scrotal complaints with any frequency. However, the incidence of acute scrotum incidence is low compared to other disease states requiring ultrasound diagnosis. This presents a problem when considering ultrasound training of Emergency Physicians for ultrasound of the scrotum in a Point-of-care perspective. With this narrative review, we will attempt to raise the awareness of emergency medicine doctors to the importance of ultrasound of the scrotum in the Emergency Department. We will also discuss educational aspects in testicular ultrasound and the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound. Finally, we propose an algorithm for action."

    "abstract": "Pediatric testicular torsion is a surgical emergency with known health disparities. The US News and World Report is an American media company that ranks colleges and hospitals based on annually published criteria. Hospitals that complied with the US News and World Report's (USNWR) Speed in Treating Testicular Torsion (SiTTT) metric saw improved surgical testicular salvage rates, but the metric's impact in mitigating inequities in testicular torsion is unstudied. A retrospective cohort study of patients 1-18 years of age presenting with testicular torsion was performed using the Pediatric Health Information System database. Hospitals were classified based on their SiTTT score at the metric's onset in 2015: they were labeled complete-scoring if they achieved the maximum score and partial-scoring otherwise. Surgical testicular salvage was defined as orchiopexy without concomitant orchiectomy. Testicular salvage rates were compared based on various socioeconomic variables including race between the pre-metric (2010-2015) and post-metric (2015-2019) periods with both univariate and adjusted, multivariate analyses. We identified 3950 cases of testicular torsion: 2335 in complete-scoring hospitals and 1615 in partial-scoring hospitals. Only partial-scoring hospitals improved significantly in salvage rate (pre-metric 61.0 % vs post-metric 67.5 %, p < 0.01). Subgroup analysis revealed the largest benefit in patients with economic or communicative barriers such as those with complex chronic conditions (pre-metric 35.3 % vs post-metric 61.1 %, p < 0.05). No minority races had statistically significant improvement after the metric, and salvage rate gap between White and all other races increased (pre-metric 4.3 % vs post-metric 10.0 %, p < 0.05). Patients with communicative or economic barriers showed improved equity after efforts to comply with a third-party metric, but disparities persisted for minority races. Future studies may better classify the mediators of this association. Retrospective Cohort Study. Level IV: Evidence from well-designed case-control or cohort studies."

Results showed that oxygen saturation and pulse rate were undetectable in all torted testes but detectable in all unaffected testes. However, due to the small sample size, the results of this study cannot be reliably extrapolated to a wider population. This review excluded research articles where near-infrared spectroscopy was used rather than pulse oximetry to characterise testicular blood flow, though that technology may also show future promise.The clinical bottom line is that there is currently insufficient evidence for the use of pulse oximetry in this context. However, the evidence identified suggests that the technique shows promise, particularly for use in resource-poor environments."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a common emergency in adolescents, and can lead to severe ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI). LncRNA H19 has been shown to increase during ischemia, but its role in testicular IRI remains unknown. Focusing on this research gap, we utilized H19 biallelic mutant mice and Sertoli cell line (TM4) to construct in vivo and in vitro models of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R). Compared to WT I/R mice, H19-/- I/R mice showed milder tissue disorganization and cell loss, with a more intact blood-testis barrier (BTB). The cell viability decreased, ROS levels and apoptosis-related factors such as Bax/Bcl-2 increased in TM4 cells after OGD/R, whereas these changes were reversed when H19 was knocked down followed by OGD/R (si-H19+OGD/R). In contrast, over-expression of H19 in TM4 cells exacerbates OGD/R-induced cell apoptosis. Through in-depth analysis of KEGG-enriched pathways, the PI3K/AKT pathway was identified as a potential target of H19 modulation. Western blotting confirmed that, in OGD/R cells, elevated H19 levels were accompanied by the excessive AKT phosphorylation and the tight junction marker ZO-1 degradation; and in si-H19+OGD/R cells, the decreased AKT phosphorylation was recovered and the up-regulated ZO-1 expression was weakened simultaneously via using the AKT activator SC79. These results suggest that inhibiting H19 in OGD/R cells might preserve the integrity of the BTB by reversing the excessive phosphorylation of AKT. Moreover, H19 deficiency in si-H19+OGD/R cells alleviated the disturbances in glycolysis, fatty acid biosynthesis, and amino acid metabolism. Our study indicates that H19 might be a potential therapeutic target for clinic testicular I/R treatment."

Independent risk variables for testicular resection were evaluated by logistic regression analyses, leading to the establishment of a nomogram. The performance of the nomogram was assessed and validated using AUC, C-index, calibration curves, and DCA. Patients were classified based on their risk score obtained from the nomogram for clinical application. A total of 387 patients were included. Risk factors were identified by multifactorial analysis: symptoms duration, testicular blood flow, degree of torsion, and cryptorchidism. A nomogram exhibits an area under the ROC curve of 0.9305 and a C-index of 0.9310. A scoring system was developed accordingly, categorising patients into four groups; 88.7% of patients in the super-low and low-risk categories preserved their testes, while 78.6% in the super-high and high-risk categories underwent testicular resection.

While early surgical intervention may offer some benefit, in many prenatal cases, preventing testicular loss remains challenging, even with timely intervention. Early recognition remains challenging due to subtle clinical presentations in newborns. This study aims to analyze the clinical characteristics, diagnostic methods, and treatment outcomes of neonatal testicular torsion, providing a reference for early diagnosis and intervention of the disease. A retrospective analysis was conducted on cases of neonatal testicular torsion admitted to Anhui Provincial Children's Hospital from August 2014 to June 2024. Information collected included the infants' age, at diagnosis onset time, clinical manifestations, diagnostic methods, surgical treatment, and postoperative follow-up results. This study included 21 cases of neonatal testicular torsion. Among them, 1 case involved bilateral testicular torsion, and the remaining 20 cases involved unilateral torsion, with 11 cases on the right side and 9 on the left. The median age at diagnosis of the patients was 1 day (IQR: 1-3), and the median onset time was 24 h (IQR: 10-60). All patients underwent surgical exploration, revealing a median torsion angle of 720 degrees (IQR: 360-720). The average surgery duration was 57.9 min (SD: 25.9). In the case of bilateral testicular torsion, the blood supply was restored after detorsion, and the testicles were preserved. However, in the 20 cases of unilateral torsion, necrotic testicles were removed. Postoperative follow-up over an average period of 31.3 months (SD: 11.5) showed no atrophy in the preserved testicles, with good development of the contralateral testicles and no recurrence of torsion. Neonatal testicular torsion is rare and urgent, often prenatally occurring with high testicular necrosis risk. Ultrasound is crucial for diagnosing cryptorchid testicular torsion. Clinical uncertainty requires prompt surgical exploration to save the testicle."

    "abstract": "Up to 22% of pediatric patients with testicular torsion (TT) present initially with lower abdominal pain, which progresses to scrotal pain over time. Misdiagnosis can lead to testicular loss. This study examines the frequency of this presentation in adults and its clinical implications. We retrospectively analyzed 92 adult patients diagnosed with TT at our Emergency Departments (EDs). Clinical presentations, diagnostic procedures, and outcomes were reviewed, focusing on cases with abdominal pain as the initial symptom. Seven of 92 patients (6.44%) presented with abdominal pain alone. Testicular viability was preserved in three cases, highlighting the importance of early recognition, of those: two had early testicular pain (< 6 h) which prompted surgery; the third had TT discovered during urologic consultation requested because of recent history of testicular pain, even if no scrotal symptoms were present at that moment. In four cases, delayed diagnosis led to testicular necrosis. Three had late (> 7 h) development of testicular pain; the fourth had testicular pain at < 6 h but, a false negative US examination misinterpreted as epididymitis. Although this study is retrospective and reconstructing the exact onset of symptoms is difficult and this may lead to potential bias; the study identifies abdominal pain as a rare but clinically significant first symptom of TT in adults. TT should be considered in differential diagnosis of all adults with lower abdominal pain and testes should be always assessed during physical examination of any male with such symptoms."

The goal is to enhance the understanding of this rare condition and provide valuable insights into its diagnosis and management, based on clinical and surgical findings. A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of 21 children with cryptorchidism who experienced testicular torsion and were treated at Anhui Provincial Children's Hospital from January 2015 to June 2024. Among the 21 patients, five had bilateral cryptorchidism, all of which involved unilateral testicular torsion, with 16 cases on the left side and five on the right side. The median age of the patients was 48 months [interquartile range (IQR): 8.5-117.5 months]. The median onset time, defined as the time interval between the onset of symptoms and surgical intervention, was 24 hours (IQR: 12-72 hours). All patients underwent surgical exploration. The average surgery time was 60.9 [standard deviation (SD): 25.1] minutes, with an average blood loss of 4.5 (SD: 2.3) mL. The median torsion angle was 540° (IQR: 270°-720°). Intraoperatively, 18 testes were found to have irreversible necrosis and were removed, while three were successfully detorsed and preserved with good blood supply. Postoperative follow-up for an average of 50.4 (SD: 18.3) months showed no atrophy in the surviving testes, and the contralateral fixed testes developed well without recurrent torsion. Testicular torsion in children with cryptorchidism is rare and often presents with subtle symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial. Ultrasound plays a significant role in the diagnosis of testicular torsion in cryptorchidism. The degree of torsion and the time of onset are critical factors for improving testicular survival rates. It is recommended that surgical intervention be performed early in cryptorchid patients older than six months to reduce the risk of testicular torsion."

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of lupeol on testicular ischemia-reperfusion damage. Thirty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to five groups: Control (C), Lupeol (L), Ischemia (Isc),Treatment 1 (T1), and Treatment 2 (T2). In the study groups, detorsion was applied to the left testicles following the induction of 720-degree testicular torsion for two hours. In the T1 and T2 groups, 100 mg/kg of lupeol was administered intraperitoneally 30 minutes before and immediately after detorsion. At the sixth hour, blood and testicular tissue samples were collected from each rat. Measurements included serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), tissue glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and caspase-3 levels. Histopathological analysis was performed to assess the Johnsen Tubular Biopsy Score (JTBS). Levels of caspase-3 (2.74+-0.32), MDA (1.71+-0.26), IL-6 (4.92+-0.57), and TNF-α (113.18+-29.77) were elevated in Group Isc compared to Group C and showed a significant reduction in Group T2 (2+-0.67, 1.16+-0.36, 3.95+-0.17, and 106.13+-12.49, respectively) and particularly in Group T1 (1.65+-0.50, 0.95+-0.143, 80+-0.35, and 104.86+-8.42, respectively) (p=0.001). However, while TNF-αlevels decreased in both treatment groups, the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.768). GSH levels decreased in Group Isc(140.63+-25.71) but increased in Group T2 (211.58+-95.05) (p=0.753) and particularly in Group T1 (219.9+-48.21)(p=0.078). The JTBS was lowest in Group Isc (7.67+-0.25). However, improvements were observed in both treatment groups (8.93+-0.16 and 8.82+-0.22, respectively) (p=0.001). This study, the first to use lupeol in an experimental testicular torsion model, demonstrated its antioxidant, antiinflammatory, anti-apoptotic, histopathological damage-reducing, and protective effects. blood and testicular tissue samples were obtained from each rat.

    "abstract": "There is no robust evidence for the efficacy of intraoperative antibiotics in preventing infections in testicular torsion surgery, the incidence of which is reported to be <0.2 %. In the absence of clear guidelines regarding the appropriate use of antibiotic prophylaxis, the factors influencing these differences in practice patterns remain unclear. Our study aimed to identify both patient and institution-level factors affecting whether a pediatric patient undergoing emergency testicular detorsion (orchiopexy or orchiectomy) will receive antibiotic prophylaxis. We utilized the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database to identify patients≤18 years old who underwent testicular septopexy or orchiectomy with the diagnosis of torsion of the testis between 2015 and 2021. Patient visits for repeated presentations of torsion were excluded from the analysis. We used multivariate logistic regression to evaluate if pre-procedural antibiotic prophylaxis was associated with hospital-level factors (treating hospital) or patient-level factors (case complexity, concurrent orchiectomy, age category, race/ethnicity, income quintile, insurance). We included 5313 children who underwent surgeries for testicular torsion. Median age was 13 (IQR 10-15 years). 74.0 % patients received antibiotic prophylaxis. Compared to no antibiotic prophylaxis, those who received antibiotic prophylaxis were significantly older (p < 0.001). After adjusting for race/ethnicity, orchiectomy vs septopexy, income quintiles, insurance, and comorbidities, older age (12-18 years compared to the 0-12 age group, OR = 1.6 (95 % CI 1.4-1.9, p < 0.001) and hospital (p < 0.001) remained significantly associated with choice of antibiotic prophylaxis for testicular torsion surgeries. There is wide variation in antibiotic prophylaxis use for patients undergoing testicular detorsion at freestanding children's hospitals in the United States. Older patients (age 12-18) are more likely to receive antibiotic prophylaxis prior to testicular torsion surgery. On the other hand, no obvious benefit in reducing subsequent hospital readmission rate was found associated with antibiotic prophylaxis. This study was limited by an inherent reliance on accurate documentation of antimicrobial-associated allergic reaction(s) and readmission rates in this PHIS database. Given the risks associated with excessive antibiotic use, an understanding of the factors and proper standardization is warranted. Significant variation in antibiotic prophylaxis demonstrates the need for clearer guidelines and evidence-based practice. Future work may illustrate the potential impact on standardized protocols on reducing unwarranted antibiotic use."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a urological emergency requiring timely intervention to prevent irreversible damage, infertility, or orchiectomy. To investigate the protective effects of lithium against testicular torsion/detorsion (T/D) damage in a rat model. Seventy-two adult rats were randomly assigned to six groups: Group I: sham-operated control; Group II: lithium treatment with sham surgery; Groups III-VI: 4-h ischemia by 720° counterclockwise testis twisting, followed by 24-h reperfusion. Two hours before the onset of reperfusion, rats in Groups III-VI received vehicle or varying doses of lithium chloride (12, 30, or 60 mg/kg). We assessed oxidative stress, inflammation, and nitrosative stress biomarkers, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) levels, and conducted histopathological examinations. Lithium showed remarkable protective effects against T/D injury, with 60 mg/kg being most effective. This dosage significantly reduced malondialdehyde, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and nitric oxide metabolite levels by 44 %, 78 %, 55 %, and 65 % compared to the vehicle group, respectively. It also inhibited GSK-3β by promoting Ser9 phosphorylation. Histopathological analysis revealed lithium treatment was effective in minimizing testicular damage, restoring testicular weight, and preserving the structural integrity of seminiferous tubules. Despite previous reports of lithium toxicity in testicular tissue, lithium treatment serves as a promising option to prolong the therapeutic window for intervention and protect against ischemia-reperfusion injury following surgical correction of testicular torsion."

    "title": "Impact of seasonality and ambient temperature on testicular torsion incidence: A Mexican Nationwide population-based study.",
    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency characterized by twisting the spermatic cord, disrupting blood flow, and causing severe pain and swelling. It predominantly affects males aged 12 to 18, with an incidence of about 3.8 per 100,000 in this age group. Immediate surgical intervention is vital, as irreversible damage can occur within 4-6 h of symptom onset. Recent studies have suggested a correlation between low ambient temperatures and an increased incidence of testicular torsion, particularly in colder months. This study aims to analyze the relationship between temperature variations, seasonal trends, and testicular torsion incidence in Mexico from 2014 to 2024. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a hospital admissions database from Mexico, covering December 2013 to July 2024. Patients diagnosed with testicular torsion (ICD-10 code N44X) aged 1 year or older were included, resulting in 3973 admissions after exclusions. ANOVA was used for seasonal difference analysis, and the Kruskal-Wallis U test was employed to examine climatic regions. Post-hoc comparisons utilized Tukey's test for monthly incidence. The Spearman rank test evaluated the correlation between mean monthly temperatures and incidence. A heatmap displayed monthly incidence by state. Significant seasonal variations in incidence rates were observed: averages were 0.07 ± 0.02 in winter, 0.05 ± 0.02 in spring, 0.04 ± 0.02 in summer, and 0.05 ± 0.02 in fall (p = 0.001). Seasonal fluctuations correlated significantly with ambient temperatures (p < 0.001). Post-hoc analysis indicated that winter incidence was notably higher than in other seasons (p < 0.05). Monthly incidence rates were similar in temperate and tropical regions (p = 0.095) but higher than in the subtropical zone (p < 0.05). A moderate negative correlation between ambient temperature and monthly incidence was found, strongest in subtropical regions (R = -0.323, p = 0.000). The present work is the first to comprehensively examine the relationship between ambient temperature and testicular torsion incidence in Mexico, showing significant seasonal patterns. The findings align with previous research in Latin America, suggesting lower temperatures increase the risk of torsion. Public health initiatives are crucial to raising awareness and potentially improving early diagnosis and management strategies. A clear association between seasonal temperature fluctuations and testicular torsion incidence was observed, particularly during winter months in Mexico."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion (TT) is a urological emergency requiring prompt intervention to prevent irreversible damage to the testicle. This study aims to assess trends in men's TT referrals, diagnostic evaluation through Doppler sonography (DS) scan, symptoms before surgery, orchidectomy rates, and TT laterality in relation to age and seasons of the year. This observational retrospective cohort study included all patients treated for TT at King Abdullah University Hospital between 2009 and 2021. Patients underwent DS, scrotal exploration, orchidopexy, or orchidectomy. Data collected encompassed patient demographics, admission date, duration of symptoms, laterality, and surgical intervention. Our study consisted of 308 TT patients between the ages of 10 and 33. Approximately 194 (63%) patients who were taken to the hospital for an average of 47 hours got an orchidectomy. Although the majority of patients received orchidopexy within 72 hours of detorsion and orchidopexy, five patients (3.6%) required reperfusion following detorsion and orchidopexy. A total of 112 individuals (36.4%) underwent bilateral orchidopexy, which lasted anywhere from 9 to 26 hours, whereas 194 (63%) patients underwent orchidectomy, which lasted anything from 40 to 264 hours (p < 0.001). The prevalence of right-sided TT increases by 6% per year with age (p = 0.047). This study found a high association between the amount of recoverable testicular tissue and the duration of symptoms before surgery. Even after 72 hours, it is still possible to salvage the testicles, even though the success rate reduces from 75% within 24 hours to 3.6% beyond that. Additionally, elderly individuals are more likely to experience right-sided torsion. Seasonal variation was evident, with the highest incidence of TT occurring during winter months, suggesting potential environmental or physiological triggers."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a critical urological emergency that can lead to testicular ischemia and significant tissue damage. Citrulline, a supplement known for enhancing cellular metabolism and mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation, has been explored for its protective effects against testicular injury resulting from torsion and detorsion in rat models. This study involved 42 Wistar rats, divided into six groups: Sham, torsion/detorsion (T/D), and four groups receiving varying doses of Citrulline (300, 600, 900 mg/kg) and vitamin E (20 mg/kg). A surgical procedure was performed to induce torsion by rotating the left testicle for 4 hr, followed by reperfusion. Daily oral administration of the supplements continued for one week post-surgery. Assessments included oxidative stress markers, apoptosis, inflammation, pathology, and sperm parameters. Statistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism. Citrulline administration at doses of 600 and 900 mg/kg significantly reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Additionally, it increased glutathione (GSH) levels and decreased protein carbonyl levels at the 900 mg/kg dose. The expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) decreased at 900 mg/kg, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels dropped at 600 and 900 mg/kg, and the pro-apoptotic factor Bax was reduced at all doses. Sperm analysis showed improved sperm count and motility at the 900 mg/kg dose. Histological examination revealed significant positive effects of Citrulline on testicular tissue. Citrulline effectively lowers oxidative stress, inflammation, while enhancing sperm quality and pathological outcomes. These results indicate that Citrulline has potential as a therapeutic agent for testicular torsion."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion, a condition requiring urgent intervention, can occur at any age and present with diverse symptoms. To the best of our knowledge, no study has evaluated the characteristics of testicular torsion in childhood, a less common age group. This study showed differences in patients' characteristics between childhood and adolescence and the variation across ages. The 58 patients included were classified into two groups: childhood (1-9 years) and adolescence (10-16 years). The following patient characteristics were compared between the two groups using Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U tests: presence or absence of acute scrotum as the first symptom, period from symptom onset to diagnosis, and whether testicular salvage was achieved. Single linear regression analysis was used for testicular salvage and acute scrotum as first symptom rates to evaluate the relationship between these factors and each age every one year. Testicular torsion was observed in childhood and adolescence in 11 and 47 of the patients, respectively. The average period from first symptom onset to diagnosis was 19.97±24.31 (range, 2-72) hours, with acute scrotum as the first symptom observed in 43 patients and testicular salvage in 39. Significant differences were observed between the childhood and adolescence groups regarding the period from first symptom onset to diagnosis, presence/absence of acute scrotum as the first symptom, and testicular salvage/not salvage. Additionally, strong correlations between patient age and both testicular salvage and acute scrotum as first symptom rates were observed. Testicular torsion in childhood tends to present without typical symptoms as the acute scrotum, leading to delayed diagnosis and lower testicular salvage rates of the affected testis."

    "abstract": "The management of neonatal testicular torsion lacks consensus. Arguments in favor of emergency bilateral exploration and fixation include a salvage rate and the incidence of bilateral torsion. We performed a retrospective single-center analysis of all cases of neonatal torsion in our unit between 2012 and 2022 to assess whether our data supports this approach and to publish further data on a disease on which there remains a paucity. During this period, there were 28 neonates with suspected torsion - 24 had torsion. The majority, 25 (89%), of patients were explored, with 12 (48%) of these as an emergency (<6 hrs of surgical review). Nineteen (95%) of those who had the symptomatic side explored also had a contralateral exploration. Three (15%) of operated testes were salvaged - one atrophied. None of the contralateral fixed testicles atrophied and there were no anesthetic complications. One patient (4%) had bilateral torsion - one testicle was asymptomatic and chronically infarcted, and the symptomatic testis was not salvageable, leading to anorchia. We conclude that neonatal torsion has a salvage rate, and bilateral exploration and fixation are low risk. Moreover, we present a rare case of bilateral torsion and an asymptomatic contralateral torsion - pediatric surgeons must be made aware of such cases as delaying treatment of the symptomatic testicle could result in the devastating outcome of anorchia."

    "abstract": "Acute abdominal pain in children is a common presentation in the clinic and emergency department settings and accounts for up to 10% of childhood emergency department visits. Determining the appropriate disposition of abdominal pain in children can be challenging. The differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain, including gastroenteritis, constipation, urinary tract infection, acute appendicitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, testicular torsion, and volvulus, and the diagnostic approach vary by age. Most causes of acute abdominal pain in children are self-limited. Symptoms and signs that indicate referral for surgery include pain that is severe, localized, and increases in intensity; pain preceding vomiting; bilious vomiting; hematochezia; guarding; and rigidity. Physical examination findings suggestive of acute appendicitis in children include decreased or absent bowel sounds, psoas sign, obturator sign, Rovsing sign, and right lower quadrant rebound tenderness. Initial laboratory evaluation may include urinalysis; complete blood cell count; human chorionic gonadotropin, lactate, and C-reactive protein levels; and a comprehensive metabolic profile. Ultrasonography, including point-of-care ultrasonography, for the evaluation of acute abdominal pain in children is the preferred initial imaging modality due to its low cost, ease of use, and lack of ionizing radiation. In addition to laboratory evaluation and imaging, children with red-flag or high-risk symptoms should be referred for urgent surgical consultation. Validated scoring systems, such as the Pediatric Appendicitis Score, can be used to help determine the patient's risk of appendicitis."

These tumors are classified into two main subtypes: seminomas and non-seminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs), with the latter known for their higher likelihood of metastasis. Early detection through imaging and tumor markers like alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) is crucial for favorable outcomes. We present a case of a 40-year-old male patient with a recent history of a surgically repaired right testicular torsion presenting with progressive right testicular swelling and pain. Scrotal ultrasound revealed a markedly enlarged and heterogeneous right testicle measuring 5.4 cm, with mixed echogenicity and cystic features, highly suspicious for malignancy. Tumor markers were significantly elevated, with AFP at 19,420 ng/mL and HCG at 4,749 mIU/mL, indicating a high-risk testicular tumor. The patient underwent a right radical orchiectomy, which was complicated by tumor rupture during surgery. Pathology confirmed a testicular mixed GCT composed of embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, and teratoma with vascular/lymphatic invasion. This case highlights the importance of rapid intervention in managing NSGCTs, potential role of tumors in testicular torsions, and the unusual presentation of a rapidly growing NSGCT."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency that is managed with either septopexy-only or tunica vaginalis flap with septopexy if the testis is potentially viable or orchiectomy if not. Minimizing time from ischemia onset to surgery maximizes the likelihood of testicular preservation. While factors such as time from door to OR can be easily targeted, others such as inequalities in access to care are more difficult to address. We sought to determine whether patient transfer affects testicular outcomes intraoperatively and in the long-term. Secondary goals included investigating the impact of race and Child Opportunity Index (COI) on testicular torsion outcomes and defining the optimal time cutoff from symptom onset to presentation that predicts salvage. We reviewed our prospective testicular torsion database to identify boys who underwent operative intervention for testicular torsion between January 2015 and March 2022. The association of race and COI with testicular salvage, defined as septopexy-only, was evaluated with univariate and multivariate logistic regression controlling for time to presentation, while the association of transfer with salvage was evaluated with univariate and multivariate logistic regression controlling for age, time to presentation, and time to OR. To determine the optimal cutoff for time to presentation to predict testicular salvage, the Youden index was calculated. Race and COI were not associated with testicular salvage on either univariate or multivariate logistic regression that controlled for time to presentation. Transfer status was not associated with salvage, while age, time from symptoms to presentation, and time from institutional arrival to OR were associated with salvage. The optimal time cutoff to predict salvage using the Youden index was 10.5 hours from symptom onset to presentation and 14.5 hours from symptom onset to detorsion. Time to presentation was the strongest, modifiable risk factor associated with testicular salvage. As it may be difficult for children to accurately communicate their symptoms, diagnosis and prompt management of testicular torsion can be delayed. Improvement in outcomes can be achieved by placing greater efforts into patient, parental, and primary care provider education of the signs and symptoms of testicular torsion. Race, COI, and transfer status were not found to have a statistically significant effect on testicular salvage outcomes in patients presenting with testicular torsion. Despite the common premise of a 6-hour window until testicular loss, we found that intervention within the acute window of 14.5 hours from symptom onset is still associated with salvage."

The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor family pyrin domaincontaining 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is involved in testicular torsion pathophysiology. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of nanocurcumin (nCur) on testicular tissue and the NLRP3 inflammasome components. In this experimental study, male Wistar rats (n=36) were randomly divided into six equal groups: controls, ischemia-reperfusion (I/R), I/R+nCur (50 or 100 mg/kg thirty minutes before reperfusion), and I/ R+nCur (50 or 100 mg/kg thirty minutes before reperfusion and continued for seven days). The left testis was rotated 720 (2×360) degrees counterclockwise to induce testicular torsion. After two hours of ischemia, detorsion was performed. At the end of treatment, an orchiectomy was carried out. The testis histopathology and the mRNA levels of NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), and Caspase-1 were evaluated. Our results revealed that, testicular I/R had a detrimental effect on testis histology such as the number of spermatogonia (14.5 ± 0.57, P<0.001) and the seminiferous tubules epithelium thickness (28.5 ± 11.7, P=0.007). It also significantly increased the expression of the NLRP3 inflammasome components (P<0.001). Treatment with nCur (in both doses) improved testicular damage and significantly reduced the expression of NLRP3 (P=0.007), ASC (P=0.003), and Caspase-1 (P<0.001). These results imply that nCur might be a useful therapeutic strategy in the field of reproductive medicine to diminish the side effects of testicular I/R via its anti-inflammatory properties and may be employed as adjuvant therapy to lessen testicular torsion complications."

There is a lack of reports on the clinical significance of the time of admission (on-hours vs. off-hours) on the long-term surgical outcome of TT. We retrospectively reviewed all consecutive patients <18 years who were admitted to the hospital and treated for TT during the ten years. Patients were classified according to their admission time: weekday (on-hours), outside working hours, and weekends (off-hours). They were also classified based on their testicular outcome: salvaged and non-salvaged testis. Seventy-two patients were included. Their median age was 14.2 years. Thirty-three patients (46 %) were admitted during on-hours, whereas 39 patients (54 %) were admitted during off-hours. Forty-three patients (59.7 %) required orchidopexy and, out of those, during the long-term follow-up, only 27 (37.5 %) had definitive testicular salvage. Forty-five patients (62.5 %) were with no testicular salvage. On-hours vs. off-hours admission had no impact on the clinical outcome (p = 0.25). However, significant differences in the duration of symptoms (DoS) between the orchidopexy and orchidectomy groups were observed (p < 0.001). Testicular torsion is a time-dependent diagnosis, and any delay in treatment could cause testicular loss. Our data suggest that the DoS before admission, rather than the admission time, influences the testicular outcome. The efficient management of emergencies regardless of the time of day is a key factor for the reduced probability that admission timing affects outcomes."

    "title": "Decoding Acute Scrotum: Diagnostic Accuracy of Ultrasound in Urgent Clinical Settings.",
    "abstract": "Background Acute scrotum is a medical emergency commonly encountered in clinical practice, particularly in pediatric and adolescent populations. It is characterized by sudden onset of scrotal pain and may involve swelling, redness, or tenderness. The most common etiologies include testicular torsion, epididymo-orchitis, trauma, and, less frequently, tumors. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical, especially in cases of testicular torsion, where timely surgical intervention is required to preserve testicular viability. Ultrasound (US), particularly high-resolution gray-scale imaging combined with color Doppler (CD), has emerged as the primary imaging modality for evaluating acute scrotal conditions due to its accessibility, non-invasiveness, and high diagnostic accuracy. Aims and objectives This study aims to assess the diagnostic accuracy of US in differentiating the causes of acute scrotum, specifically focusing on testicular torsion, epididymo-orchitis, and varicocele. We also evaluate its role in reducing unnecessary surgical explorations and improving clinical decision-making in urgent settings. Materials and methods This retrospective observational study was conducted in a tertiary care center in Puducherry, India. A total of 250 male patients, ranging in age from 10 to 70 years, presented with acute scrotal pain over the 12-month study period. Inclusion criteria included all patients with sudden scrotal pain, regardless of clinical suspicion of underlying pathology. US scans were performed using a 7.5- to 12-MHz linear transducer. Gray-scale imaging was used to evaluate the testes, epididymis, spermatic cord, scrotal wall, and inguinal region, while CD was used to assess vascular flow. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS Version 18 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Diagnostic accuracy was calculated based on sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Results The most common cause of acute scrotum was inflammatory pathology, including epididymo-orchitis, accounting for 56.4% of cases (141 patients). Varicocele was the second most common cause, diagnosed in 11.6% of patients (29 cases), while hernias and epididymal cysts were found in 8% and 7.6% of cases, respectively. Testicular torsion was diagnosed in 2% of cases (five patients). US demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for inflammatory pathologies, with sensitivity and specificity reaching 97% and 96%, respectively. The sensitivity for testicular torsion was 62%, reflecting the challenges in diagnosing partial or intermittent torsion, while specificity was high at 99%. US's performance in identifying varicocele was excellent, with a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 98%. Conclusion US, especially when combined with CD, is an indispensable tool in the emergency evaluation of acute scrotum. It provides high diagnostic accuracy for inflammatory pathologies and varicocele while serving as an effective screening modality for testicular torsion. This study reinforces the role of US in reducing unnecessary surgical explorations, guiding clinical management, and improving patient outcomes in urgent clinical settings."

    "abstract": "Acute scrotum is a medical emergency that requires prompt accurate diagnosis to appropriately triage potentially surgical conditions. Numerous differential diagnoses with overlapping clinical presentations make this a diagnostic challenge. Ultrasound is the established first-line imaging modality for acute scrotal disease and can be used to diagnose most scrotal disorders promptly and with high accuracy. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a common urological emergency in children and teenagers that, in most cases, requires surgical exploration and detorsion. However, even after a successful intervention, a high number of patients still develop irreversible damage. To investigate whether the administration of phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDE) in animal models of testicular torsion can reduce damages caused by the ischemia-reperfusion syndrome. A systematic search of the Medline, Web of Science, Embase, and Ovid databases for studies up to December 2023 was performed using PRISMA guidelines. A detailed search was conducted using the following key terms: \"testicles,\" \"ischemia,\" \"reperfusion,\" and \"phosphodiesterase inhibitors.\" There was no restriction regarding language or year of publication. We investigated spermatogenesis by the Johnsen's biopsy score (JTBS) and histological damage by the Cosentino's biopsy score (CBS). Malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) testicular levels were also analyzed. Initially, 296 articles were identified. However, only 20 studies met the inclusion criteria. PDE inhibitors improved JTBS (MD = 2.53, CI = 1.94 to 3.13), CBS (MD = -1.11, CI = -1.25 to -0.97) and SOD (SMD = 3.27, CI = 1.59 to 4.95) outcomes. PDE did not improve MDA (SMD = -0.93, CI = -2.19 to 0.34), NO (SMD = -0.54, CI = -1.56 to 0.48), and GPx (SMD = 0.77, CI = -0.38 to 1.92) outcomes. A higher dose of PDE inhibitors only improved CBS outcome. This review indicates that the administration of PDE inhibitors in rats ameliorated the outcomes, representing a promising complementary strategy for spermatogenesis recovery following testicular torsion. Our review suggests that JTBS and CBS could be translated into future human studies, validating and extending these findings within the context of human physiopathology, while providing applicability of interventions in real clinical practice."

    "abstract": "Surgical care for children in the United States has become increasingly regionalized among fewer centers over time. The degree to which regionalization may be associated with access to urgent surgical care for time-sensitive conditions is not clear. To investigate whether transfers and travel distance have increased for 4 surgical conditions, and whether changes in transfers and travel distance have been more pronounced for rural vs urban children. This retrospective cross-sectional study analyzed data from 9 State Inpatient Databases from 2002 to 2017. Participants included children aged younger than 18 years undergoing urgent or emergent procedures for malrotation with volvulus, esophageal foreign body, and ovarian and testicular torsion. Residential and hospital zip codes were categorized as rural or urban. Hospitals were categorized as pediatric hospitals, adult hospitals with pediatric services, and adult hospitals without pediatric services. Primary outcomes were transfer for care and travel distance between patients' home residences and the hospitals where care was provided. Transfer and travel distance were analyzed using multivariable regression models. Among the 5865 children younger than 18 years undergoing procedures for malrotation with volvulus, esophageal foreign body, ovarian torsion, or testicular torsion, 461 (7.9%) resided in a rural area; 1097 (20.5%) were Hispanic, 1334 (24.9%) were non-Hispanic Black, and 2255 (42.0%) were non-Hispanic White; 2763 (47.1%) were covered by private insurance and 2535 (43.2%) were covered by Medicaid; and the median (IQR) age was 9 (2-14) years. Most care was provided at adult hospitals (73.4% with and 16.9% without pediatric services); the number of hospitals providing this care decreased from 493 to 292 hospitals (2002 vs 2017). Transfer was associated with rural residence (adjusted odds ratio [aRR], 2.3 [95% CI, 1.8-3.0]; P < .001) and increased over time (2017 vs 2002: aOR, 2.8 [95% CI, 2.0-3.8]; P < .001). Similarly, travel distance was associated with rural residence (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 4.4 [95% CI, 3.9-4.8]; P < .001) and increased over time (2017 vs 2002: aRR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.2-1.4]; P < .001). Rural children were more frequently transferred (2017 vs 2002) for esophageal foreign body (48.0% [12 of 25] vs 7.3% [4 of 55]; P < .001), ovarian torsion (26.7% [4 of 15] vs 0% [0 of 18]; P = .01), and testicular torsion (18.2% [2 of 11] vs 0% [0 of 16]; P = .04). Travel distance for rural children increased the most for torsions, from a median (IQR) of 19.1 (2.3-35.4) to 43.0 (21.6-98.8) miles (P = .03) for ovarian torsion and from 7.3 (0.4-23.7) to 44.5 (33.1-48.8) miles (P < .001) for testicular torsion. In this cross-sectional study of children with time-sensitive surgical conditions, the number of hospitals providing urgent surgical care to children decreased over time. Transfers of care, especially among rural children, and travel distance, especially for those with ovarian and testicular torsion, increased over time."

At present, there are few paper about long time follow-up of these patients. The primary objective of our study is to report the long-term clinical-instrumental data (mean follow-up 12 years) of patients treated for testicular torsion. We considered patients treated for testicular torsion during the period between 1997 and 2017. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were created. Patients were contacted by phone between December 2021 and January 2022. Each patient underwent clinical and ultrasonographic evaluation, and in addition, some subjects were offered additional tests (hormonal assays and semen analysis). During the study period, 22 patients were treated for testicular torsion. From the ultrasonographic study, it was found that the volume of the affected testis is reduced and it is associated with microcalcifications and heterogeneous echogenicity. Morphovolumetric recovery seems to be more related to age of onset than to the degree of torsion. Based on our results we can state that affected testes, if preserved, grow less and have altered ultrasonographic morphology. Clinically, the age of onset of torsion seems more important than the degree of torsion."

Spinal anesthesia (SA) has emerged as a safe and effective alternative for routine pediatric urologic procedures. In this study, we describe the use of SA in the urgent surgical treatment of neonatal testicular torsion. We aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SA for urgent scrotal exploration in neonates. We retrospectively collected data on neonates younger than 30 days old undergoing SA for the indication of testicular torsion from May 2018 to June 2022. We recorded patient demographics, adjuvant medications use, and time points for start/stop of spinal injection, procedure, and operating room utilization. Six neonates, with an average age of 1.9 days of life and average weight of 3.4 kg, underwent scrotal exploration for testicular torsion using SA. Four patients (67%) required orchiectomy of the nonviable torsed testicle, and all patients underwent orchiopexy of the unaffected testicle. Mean total operative time was 45.3 (SD 11.7) minutes, including Gomco circumcision in five patients. One patient received preoperative intranasal dexmedetomidine for sedation. Mean time for SA administration was 6.3 (SD 5.5) minutes, with a mean total time in the operating room of 77.3 (SD 9.8) minutes. There were no perioperative or postoperative complications. We describe a single institution experience of surgical management of neonatal torsion under SA. In this case series, SA was safely utilized for all neonates involved without the need for conversion to GA or intravenous (IV) sedation. The use of SA is safe and efficacious for urgent scrotal exploration for testicular torsion in neonates, even those under 48 h of age. More widespread utilization requires collaboration between pediatric urologists and experienced pediatric anesthesiologists trained in SA."

A total of 24 neonates were enrolled in this study, all of whom were unilateral cases. Age of onset was 0 d (IQR: 0-1.8), while the median duration of symptoms was 73 h (IQR: 26-199). Clinical manifestation included enlarged scrotum (75 %), changes in scrotal color (79 %), and crying upon palpation (17 %). All patients underwent urgent bilateral exploration and performed by orchiectomy and contralateral orchiopexy. NTT primarily occurs prenatally with insidious manifestations, often leading to omission or misdiagnosis. The testicular salvage rate is extremely low. Physicians need to attach importance to neonatal testicular examination, improve the vigilance of NTT. Early bilateral exploration does not necessarily save the affected testes, but it is more important to prevent damage to the contralateral one."

Of the 95 respondents, 62.1% had over 10 years of experience, and 48.4% treated more than five cases of TT annually. Of the participants, 87.4% stated that scrotal Doppler ultrasonography (US) was always used, and 12.6% stated that US was used in cases of doubtful diagnosis. Concerning treatment, 14.7% reported performing manual detorsion, 70.5% never did, and 14.7% did so only if the operating room was unavailable soon. A total of 92.6% of participants opted for emergency surgery. Among participants who perform manual detorsion, 71.4% perform surgery within 24 hours after successful manual detorsion. Regarding fixation of the contralateral testicle, 14.7% never performed it, and 27.4% did so only when they performed an orchiectomy on the torsion testicle. While most participants follow EAU pediatric urology guidelines by performing emergency surgery, the rate of manual detorsion is low. Few participants stated that emergency surgery may not be performed after manual detorsion. While all of the participants performed fixation of the torsion testicle in accordance with the guidelines, the same adherence was not observed in the contralateral testicle."

    "abstract": "This case report highlights a rare but significant complication of blunt trauma requiring preperitoneal packing and illustrates the intricate relationship between trauma surgery and urological emergencies. Testicular torsion is an acute urological emergency necessitating prompt surgical intervention to salvage testicular function. While commonly associated with intrinsic factors such as the \"bell-clapper\" deformity, extrinsic factors such as trauma and postoperative complications can also precipitate this condition. This case underscores the complexity of diagnosing and managing testicular torsion arising after surgical interventions for pelvic fractures, a scenario sparsely documented in medical literature. We present a 27-year-old male who sustained multiple injuries, including a pelvic fracture, from a motorcycle accident and subsequently underwent preperitoneal packing for significant pelvic hemorrhage. Five days post-operation, the patient developed acute right lower quadrant and unilateral testicular pain, leading to the diagnosis of testicular torsion via Doppler ultrasonography. An emergency bilateral orchiopexy was performed, revealing a 180° torsion of the right testis. This case illustrates the need for a heightened awareness of potential genitourinary complications following trauma surgery. The pathophysiological mechanisms possibly include increased intra-abdominal pressure and altered testicular mobility due to surgical interventions. The report emphasizes the importance of multidisciplinary care in trauma settings to ensure comprehensive evaluation and management of patients, including the consideration of urological complications. Testicular torsion following preperitoneal packing for pelvic fractures represents a critical intersection between trauma surgery complications and urological emergencies, necessitating vigilant postoperative care and multidisciplinary collaboration for timely diagnosis and intervention. This case contributes to the broader understanding of postoperative complications, advocating for an integrated approach to patient care in high-energy trauma scenarios."

    "abstract": "Recognizing testicular torsion is extremely important in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute scrotal pain. Traditional manual detorsion techniques are frequently employed by emergency physicians but are not always successful. Delays in detorsion increase the risk of testicular infarction and infertility, and the need for orchiectomy. Novel techniques such as the testicular traction technique have been described as a potential solution for difficult-to-detorse testicles. Our case report describes a 20-year-old male with no significant past medical history who presented to a rural ED with acute, atraumatic testicular pain secondary to testicular torsion with an intact cremasteric reflex. After confirming the diagnosis using Doppler ultrasound, manual detorsion using the traditional \"open book\" technique was attempted and unsuccessful. The patient was subsequently successfully detorsed using the novel testicular traction technique. The testicular traction technique is a safe, rapid, and effective primary or adjunctive technique in manual testicular detorsion. Given the time-sensitive nature of testicular torsions, adjunctive techniques play a crucial role in managing challenging detorsions, particularly in resource-limited rural settings with limited access to urologic services. Although it is commonly thought that the cremasteric reflex is absent in testicular torsions, it may be present in rare circumstances, and its presence should not be an absolute in ruling out torsion."

A retrospective study of patient records of children who underwent surgery for acute scrotum due to dirofilariasis between 2018 and 2022. There were eight emergency presentations for acute scrotum due to dirofilariasis. Three presentations (37.5%) were not associated with scrotal pain. The median age at presentation was 59 (range: 19-100) months. Four patients (67.7%) underwent emergency scrotal exploration at the first presentation and another one during the second presentation. Recurrent episodes were seen in two patients who were initially managed nonsurgically with antibiotics alone. Ultrasonography was performed in all six patients and revealed a parasitic nodule in three (50%). Dirofilariasis causing acute scrotum may cause significant diagnostic dilemma for clinicians. It may resemble idiopathic scrotal edema since it predominantly affects boys under 6 years of age and is painless in a significant proportion. However, left unoperated, it appears to have a high recurrence rate."

Mesothelial tumours of the tunica vaginalis is rare compared with those arise from pleura or peritoneum. According to World Health Organization 2022 Classification of Urinary and Male Genital Tumours (5th edition), mesothelial tumours of the tunica vaginalis were categorized into adenomatoid tumour, well-differentiated papillary mesothelial tumour (WDPMT) and mesothelioma. Since WDPMT of tunica vaginalis was rare, there was no consensus concerning the treatment of it. In this case report, a 29-year-old man who had endured intermittent right scrotal pain for 8 months, aggravating scrotal pain for 2 weeks was admitted. No symptoms, such as frequent, urgent, or painful urination were shown. Physical examination revealed the enlargement and tenderness of right scrotum, with no signs of lifting pain. The most recent scrotal ultrasonography before surgery revealed right hydrocele with maximum depth of 4 centimeters and poor blood flow of right testis. Under the circumstance of patient' s chronic history of testicular hydrocele, he underwent an emergency operation of right scrotal exploration and hydrocelectomy under epidural anesthesia. After opening the vagina tunic cavity, spot-like bleeding was observed on the right testicle, epididymis and vaginalis surface. The vaginalis was obviously thickened and the inner and outer walls were smooth. The post-operative histopathology revealed a grayish-brown tissue with a thickness of 0.3-0.5 cm, smooth inner and outer walls, and a suspected WDPMT with a diameter of 1. 5 cm. Immunohistochemical staining showed positive for Calretinin, BAP1, WT-1, CK5/6, D2-40 and P16，which confirmed the diagnosis of WDPMT. To sum up, the purpose of this case report was to raise awareness of a rare disease WDPMT, which was usually asymptomatic and could be diagnosed by pathology and immunohistochemistry. The disease should be differentiated from testicular torsion, epididymitis, orchitis and oblique inguinal hernia in symptoms, and from malignant mesothelioma and adenomatoid tumour in pathology. Because of the rarity of the cases, there was no unified standard for the treatment of WDPMT at present. The common treatment methods reported in literature included orchidectomy and vaginectomy. Due to the lack of understanding of this disease, postoperative follow-up was still recommended for at least 5 years."

Proanthocyanidin is reported to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The current study aimed to examine the possible effects of proanthocyanidin (P) on the testis in torsion/detorsion (T/D)-induced testicular ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats. Forty rats were divided into four groups (n=10 for each): sham-operated (sham), I/R, I/R + P100 (100 mg/kg, 30 min before torsion), and I/R + P200 (200 mg/kg, 30 min before torsion). Testicular T/D was performed on the left testicle by 3 hours of torsion at 720° clockwise, followed by 3 hours of detorsion. In the I/R group, an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and a decrease in glutathione (GSH), vitamin C (Vit C), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) values were determined compared to the sham group (p<0.001). Moreover, an increase in the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and Bcl2-associated X protein (Bax), a decrease in the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were detected in the I/R group (p<0.001). Histopathologically, it was determined that the Johnsen and Cosentino scores of the testicles were irregular in the I/R group (p<0.001). Proanthocyanidin treatment caused a decrease in MDA, cleaved caspase-3 and Bax levels and an increase in GSH, Vit C, GPx, G6PD, Bcl-2 and PCNA values. Additionally, Johnsen and Cosentino rearranged the scores.

We sought to describe trends of patient transfer in our state and compare clinical outcomes and health system costs between patients transferred and treated primarily at a pediatric center. This retrospective cohort study compared patients aged 1-18 years who presented directly to a pediatric center to those transferred for acute testicular torsion from 2018 to 2023. Exclusion criteria included age <1 year, non-urgent surgery, and admission from clinic. Patient age, BMI, Tanner stage, ASA class, insurance coverage, and presentation time were covariates. Group characteristics and times from symptom onset to initial ED presentation to surgery were compared via two-sided Student's t-tests. Clinical outcomes (orchiectomy, testicular atrophy) were compared via Fisher's exact tests. Costs from transferring hospitals were estimated from costs at our institution, and medical transport costs were extrapolated from contract prices between transport agencies and the pediatric center to compare total episode-of-care cost. A total of 133 cases (37 primaries, 96 transfers) met inclusion criteria. Transfers increased over the study period (67%-75%). There were no significant differences in age, Tanner stage, ASA score, BMI, or time of day of presentation between groups. Median transfer distance was 12 miles (IQR 7-22) and time was 1 h (IQR 1-2). More than half of cases (53%) were transferred due to hospital policy regarding surgical treatment of minors, and 25% due to lack of urology coverage. Time from initial ED site to OR was nearly doubled for the transfer group (median 4.5 vs 2.5 h, p = 0.02). Despite a higher rate of orchiectomy in the primary group (43 vs 22%, p = 0.01), this difference was not significant after stratification by symptom duration. The estimated average cost of care for patients transferred was twice that of primary patients ($15,082 vs $6898). Transfer of pediatric patients in our state for testicular torsion has increased in recent years. Hospital policies and local urology coverage are primary drivers of patient transfer which nearly doubled time to surgical intervention and more than doubled cost of care. Clinical outcomes were driven by delayed presentation. Transfer of pediatric patients for testicular torsion nearly doubles time to surgical intervention and more than doubles cost of care. Restrictive hospital policies and gaps in rural hospital urology coverage present opportunities to improve the quality and efficiency of care for these children."

    "abstract": "Acute scrotal pain (ASP) is the most common urological emergency in pediatrics, and its causes include testicular torsion (TT), testicular appendage torsion, and epididymo-orchitis. Among them, TT requires prompt and accurate diagnosis and urgent surgical exploration to prevent testicular loss. Conservative anti-infective treatment is recommended for epididymo-orchitis, and surgery is considered only when scrotal abscess formation and sepsis occur. Improving the understanding of TT in primary care doctors, early diagnosis, and timely surgical exploration are essential to improve the survival rate of TT and avoid excessive treatment. This study aimed to explore the risk factors for TT in children with ASP and construct a predictive model. Clinical data of children who presented with ASP and underwent emergency scrotal exploration surgery were retrospectively analyzed, including general information, physical examination, laboratory tests, and color Doppler ultrasonography (CDU) findings. Based on surgical exploration, the outcomes were categorized as confirmed TT or not. A total of 283 children were included in this study, among whom 134 had TT. The mean age of all patients was 105±47.9 months, with the majority being of Han ethnicity (87.6%) and residing in urban areas (83%). Most patients had normal C-reactive protein levels and negative results in urine routine white blood cell tests (63.3%). After conducting univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, we identified laterality, neutrophil count, mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate, epididymal blood flow signal, testicular parenchymal echogenicity, and testicular blood flow signal as independent risk factors influencing the occurrence of TT in ASP patients. This study is the report with the largest sample size on the construction of prediction models for ASP in children in southwestern China. The predictive model we developed demonstrated excellent performance and higher accuracy in predicting TT in children compared to the traditional Testicular Workup for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion (TWIST) score. It can assist pediatric surgeons in diagnosing and treating children with ASP."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion carries the ominous prospect of inducing acute scrotal distress and the perilous consequence of testicular atrophy, necessitating immediate surgical intervention to reinstate vital testicular perfusion, notwithstanding the paradoxical detrimental impact of reperfusion. Although no drugs have secured approval for this urgent circumstance, antioxidants emerge as promising candidates. This study aspires to illustrate the influence of eprosartan, an AT1R antagonist, on testicular torsion in rats. Wistar albino rats were meticulously separated into five groups, (n = 6): sham group, eprosartan group, testicular torsion-detorsion (T/D) group, and two groups of T/D treated with two oral doses of eprosartan (30 or 60 mg/kg). Serum testosterone, sperm analysis and histopathological examination were done to evaluate spermatogenesis. Oxidative stress markers were assessed. Bax, BCL-2, SIRT1, Nrf2, HO-1 besides cleaved caspase-3 testicular contents were estimated using ELISA or qRT-PCR. As autophagy markers, SQSTM-1/p62, Beclin-1, mTOR and AMPK were investigated. Our findings highlight that eprosartan effectively improved serum testosterone levels, testicular weight, and sperm count/motility/viability, while mitigating histological irregularities and sperm abnormalities induced by T/D. This recovery in testicular function was underpinned by the activation of the cytoprotective SIRT1/Nrf2/HO-1 axis, which curtailed testicular oxidative stress, indicated by lowering the MDA content and increasing GSH content. In terms of apoptosis, eprosartan effectively countered apoptotic processes by decreasing cleaved caspase-3 content, suppressing Bax and stimulating Bcl-2 gene expression. Simultaneously, it reactivated impaired autophagy by increasing Beclin-1 expression, decreasing the expression of SQSTM-1/p62 and modulate the phosphorylation of AMPK and mTOR proteins. Eprosartan hold promise for managing testicular dysfunction arising from testicular torsion exerting antioxidant, pro-autophagic and anti-apoptotic effect via the activation of SIRT1/Nrf2/HO-1 as well as Beclin-1/AMPK/mTOR pathways."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion (TT) is a rare but urgent condition; it leads to severe pain and swelling that must be diagnosed and treated immediately, where there is an expectant period of 6-8 h. It is an important prognostic factor in the arrival time to the emergency department. Raising awareness about TT is essential to ensure early diagnosis and timely treatment, which can prevent irreversible damage and loss of fertility. Our study aimed to measure the awareness, knowledge, and attitude toward testicular torsion (TT) among the general population in Saudi Arabia. This is a cross-sectional study conducted among the general population living in Saudi Arabia. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed among the population using an online survey. The questionnaire includes socio-demographic characteristics (i.e., age, gender, region, etc.), a questionnaire to assess the knowledge of testicular torsion, and questionnaires to assess the prevalence, management, and attitude toward testicular torsion. Of the 473 participants, 56% were males, and 61% were aged between 18 to 30 years old. Unfortunately, One quarter of our population has a good knowledge level about testicular torsion. The overall mean knowledge about Testicular Torsion score was below average (3 out of 8 points). Factors associated with increased knowledge include younger age, male gender, living in the Central Region, working in the medical field, having heard of testicular torsion, and having a personal or family history of testicular torsion. In conclusion, there was a lack of testicular torsion knowledge among the general population. Further studies and social campaigns should be done to encourage the general population's understanding and increase their knowledge level."

    "abstract": "Even though infected vasitis is rarely reported in the literature, there are other diagnoses that share the same clinical signs, including testicular torsion, epididymo-orchitis, epididymitis, trauma, and incarcerated hernia. A 27-year-old man was brought to the emergency department by his brother with right inguinal and testicular pain for one day. The history was not significant with fever, lower urinary tract symptoms, urethral discharge, change in bowel habits, previous history of inguinal swelling, or surgical intervention. On presentation, the patient was vitally stable, and right infra-inguinal and inguinal vas deferens were tender and swollen; however, both testes and epididymis were normal, and no urethral discharge. Vasitis, or inflammation of the vas deferens, is an uncommon illness that Chan PT and Schlegel classified as either asymptomatic vasitis nodosa or severely painful infectious vasitis. Acute infective vasitis is a really uncommon illness, with only a few occurrences documented in the literature. However, the retrograde transmission of urinary pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenza is thought to cause acute vasitis. Because of its rarity and ambiguous imaging findings, diagnosing vasitis can be difficult. Epididymitis, orchitis, and testicular torsion can all be ruled out with ultrasound and duplex Doppler screening. Inguinal hernia is difficult to distinguish from vasitis with ultrasound; hence, CT and MRI are more commonly used to confirm the diagnosis. Since this is the first occurrence in our city that we are aware of, it was reported. A few cases from Saudi Arabia have also been documented, and by doing so, we may raise clinicians' awareness of this disease and ensure that they can treat patients without making an incorrect diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Suspicion of testicular torsion represents a urological emergency, necessitating immediate surgery. Comprehensive data on the current trends and perioperative outcomes regarding surgical exploration are sparse. Therefore, we utilized nationwide data on the prevalence and results of this surgery, aiming to provide evidence on this matter. We assessed the GeRmAn Nationwide inpatient Data (GRAND) from 2005 to 2021, provided by the Research Data Center of the Federal Bureau of Statistics. We performed multiple regression analyses to evaluate the perioperative outcomes (length of hospital stay, transfusion, and surgical wound infection) after surgical exploration due to suspected testicular torsion based on both the outcome of surgery (orchiectomy, detorsion with preservation of the testicle, and no testicular torsion) and on the department of operation (urological versus non-urological). A total of 81,899 males underwent surgical exploration due to suspected testicular torsion in Germany from 2005 to 2021. Of them, 11,725 (14%) underwent orchiectomy, 30,765 (38%) detorsion with preservation of the testicle and subsequent orchidopexy, and 39,409 (48%) presented no testicular torsion. Orchiectomy was significantly associated with longer length of hospital stay (day difference of 1.4 days, 95%CI: 1.3-1.4, p < 0.001), higher odds of transfusion (1.8, 95% CI: 1.2-2.6, p = 0.002) and surgical wound infections (1.8, 95%CI: 1.4-2.3, p < 0.001) compared to no testicular torsion. The proportion of patients undergoing orchiectomy was significantly lower in urological departments (14%) versus non-urological departments (16%) and the proportion of patients undergoing preservation of testicle after detorsion was significantly higher in urological departments (38%) versus non-urological departments (37%), p < 0.001. Patients undergoing treatment in a urological department were discharged earlier and presented lower odds of transfusion and surgical wound infection (p < 0.001) compared to patients undergoing treatment in a non-urological department. Nearly half of patients who underwent surgery for suspected testicular torsion did not have intraoperatively the condition confirmed. Patients treated in urological departments had significantly better perioperative outcomes compared to those treated in non-urological departments. Therefore, we advise to refer patients to urological treatment as early as possible."

As a common emergency, timely treatment of testicular torsion acts as a benchmark of adequate emergency service delivery in paediatric surgery. This scoping study aims to synthesise all existing literature on paediatric testicular torsion in LMICs. A database search was conducted by the OxPLORE global paediatric surgery research group to identify studies containing the terms 'testicular torsion' or 'acute scrotum' originating from LMICs. A thematic analysis was applied to the results of the search and the quality of evidence was appraised for all included articles. This review included 17 studies with 1798 patients. All studies originated from middle-income countries and the majority (76%) had sample sizes smaller than 100 patients. All studies were appraised as providing less than adequate evidence. Included studies identified long delays to treatment and highlighted ongoing debates on the value of scoring systems and Doppler ultrasonography in diagnosing torsion. Major heterogeneity in surgical approaches to treatment of testicular torsion in children was also observed. Literature on paediatric testicular torsion in LMICs is scarce and heterogeneous. Prospective, multi-centre research on the management of this common paediatric surgical emergency is urgently required."

Compelling pieces of evidence have implicated oxidative stress-sensitive signaling in pathogenesis of testicular I/R injury. Although, surgical detorsion is the mainstay management; blockade of the pathways involved in the pathogenesis may improve the surgical outcome. Experimental studies using various testicular I/R models have been reported in a bid to explore the mechanisms associated with testicular I/R and evaluate the benefits of potential therapeutic measures; however, most are limited by their shortcomings. Thus, this review was intended to describe the details of the available testicular I/R models as well as their merits and drawbacks, the pathophysiological basis and consequences of testicular I/R, and the pharmacological agents that have being proposed to confer testicular benefits against testicular I/R. This provides an understanding of the pathophysiological events and available models used in studying testicular I/R.

This study examined OR timing among children with suspected TT and OT before and after this metric. A single-center retrospective cohort study of children (1-18yr) who underwent surgery for suspected gonadal torsion was performed. Time to OR (TTOR) from hospital presentation to surgery start was calculated. An interrupted time series analysis identified changes in TTOR for suspected TT versus OT after the 2015 USNWR quality metric. Overall, 216 patients presented with TT and 120 with OT. Median TTOR for TT was 147 min (IQR:99-198) versus 462 min (IQR:308-606) for OT. Post-quality metric, children with TT experienced a 27.8 min decrease (95% CI:-51.7,-3.9, p = 0.05) in annual median TTOR. No significant decrease was observed for children with OT (p = 0.22). Children with history of a known ovarian mass (N = 62) experienced a shorter TTOR compared to those without (422 vs 499min; p = 0.04). Implementation of a national quality metric for TT expedited surgical care for children with TT, but not children with OT.

A 28-year-old patient with acute left scrotal pain, initially suggestive of testicular torsion, underwent intraoperative exploration revealing extra-vaginal torsion with an incidentally discovered 2-cm intra-testicular mass. Due to suspected malignancy, a total orchiectomy was performed. Pathological analysis confirmed an epidermoid cyst with normal postoperative tumor markers. The patient had a good postoperative outcome and underwent testicular prosthesis placement 3 months after the surgery. Epidermoid cysts, often identified incidentally during urgent scenarios, underscore the importance of accurate preoperative diagnosis.

Testicular salvage is dependent on prompt intervention, and thus delays in diagnosis and management may threaten testicular viability. Knowledge of real-world Canadian practice patterns for pediatric TT will allow optimization of practices based on resource availability and geographic limitations to improve care. An electronic survey on pediatric TT management was distributed to Canadian urologists. Descriptive statistics were performed on respondent demographic factors, hospital policies and barriers to care, surgical approaches, and transfer practices. Respondent practice patterns were analyzed based on geographic location and training. Thirty-four urologists responded, with most respondents operating a community practice. Ultrasonography (US) was frequently used to support TT diagnosis. Despite this, poor US access was often cited as a barrier to care, with particular impact on rural urologists. Neonatal patients and <10 years old were commonly transferred to a pediatric hospital for definitive management due to surgeon discomfort and hospital policies. Reported transport methods commonly included use of the patient's own vehicle or ambulance based on availability and timing. Neonatal patients and patients under 10 years old are most commonly reported to be transferred to pediatric hospitals for TT management. Patients located in rural locations and at centers with limited US access may be at risk for delayed diagnosis and treatment. Pathways for prompt management of suspected TT may better serve these younger pediatric patients."

Clinical data of 66 patients with testicular torsion treated in our emergency department from February 2017 to February 2022 were retrospectively collected. Manual reduction without anesthesia was performed in 19 patients. Patients with successful manual reduction chose different subsequent treatments according to the wishes of themselves and their guardians, including continuing conservative treatment and surgical exploration. Relevant clinical data were collected and analyzed. Manual reduction was successful in 11 patients (11/19). Seven of them chose to continue conservative treatment, and four underwent surgical exploration immediately. Among the 7 patients who were treated conservatively, 3 underwent surgical treatment due to scrotal discomfort or testicular torsion at different stages, and the remaining 4 patients showed no recurrence of torsion during follow-up. Compared with other patients, patients with successful manual reduction had the shorter duration of pain (p < 0.05). The time from visiting our hospital to surgery in patients who attempted manual reduction was slightly shorter than those who underwent surgery directly (p > 0.05). The testes of these 11 patients were all successfully preserved. The short duration of pain may contribute to the success of manual reduction, and manual reduction did not increase the preparation time before surgery. Due to the unpredictable risk of recurrence, immediate surgical treatment is still recommended, or postponed elective surgical treatment should be offered in the next days or weeks."

    "abstract": "Hernias are one of the commonest procedures performed by general surgeons. Irreducibility, intestinal obstruction, and strangulation are common outcomes of a groin hernia when there is disregard and a delay in elective surgery. Studies have shown a considerable incidence of these hernia complications, along with the associated morbidity and death, because of delayed presentation. Testicular gangrene following incarcerated hernias is a rare entity in the adult population. Here we present a case of a 30-year-old male presented with gangrenous vanished testis, perforated ileum and necrotizing fasciitis of the right groin after a neglected strangulated right inguinal hernia. Testicular infarction/gangrene is most commonly secondary to testicular torsion, an emergency that teenagers frequently experience. When it complicates inguinal hernia, it typically results in ischemia, infarction, and gangrene due to compression and impairment of the vascular supply within the inguinal canal. In cases like our where there is a necrotizing process in the groin, we feel it's appropriate to approach from the abdomen and do the resection first and proceed with the radical debridement after that. Early diagnosis and intervention with emergency surgery are crucial for strangulated inguinal hernia and prevents unnecessary escalation of the problem with progressive infectious and necrotic destruction of adjacent tissues."

POCUS can enhance diagnostic accuracy and aid in management of pediatric patients in shock and help identify reversible causes during cardiac arrest. The use of the FAST in pediatric blunt abdominal trauma remains nuanced - its proper use requires an integration with clinical findings and an appreciation of its limitations. POCUS has been shown to enhance safety and efficacy of procedures such as nerve blocks, incision & drainage, and intravenous access. Integrating POCUS into pathways for conditions such as intussusception and testicular torsion expedites downstream care. POCUS enhances diagnostic efficiency and management in pediatric patients arriving at the ED with undifferentiated shock, cardiac arrest, or trauma. Additionally, POCUS improves procedural success and safety, and is integral to clinical pathways for expediting definitive care for various pediatric emergencies. Future research should continue to focus on the impact of POCUS on patient outcomes, ensuring user competency, and the expansion of POCUS into diverse settings."

There is no universally agreed practice for how the testis should be fixed, or whether a nontorted testis should receive fixation. This survey aims to describe the methods used for emergency scrotal exploration and testicular fixation in the UK. An online survey was distributed to urologists, general surgeons and specialist paediatric surgeons in approved NHS trusts, and via the email lists of collaborating organisations. The survey questioned surgeons on their operative management of a variety of common diagnoses encountered during scrotal exploration using multiple choice and free-text answers. A total of 340 responses were received from 83 institutions. Respondents included urologists (consultants, 33%; trainees, 24%), paediatric surgeons (consultants, 12%; trainees, 16%) and general surgeons. In cases of torsion, respondents predominantly perform sutured fixation (74%); however, sutureless dartos pouch fixation was used frequently (37%) by paediatric surgeons. The finding of 'bell-clapper' anatomy without torsion prompts 69% of respondents to undertake sutured fixation, but alternative nontorsion diagnoses frequently prompt use of sutureless methods (53-66%). This study is the largest survey of methods for emergency scrotal exploration and describes current UK practice. The majority of surgeons prefer sutured fixation in cases of torsion and/or bell-clapper anomalies, and sutureless methods in the absence of it."

Possible delayed diagnosis, defined as a patient with an ED discharge within 7 days prior to diagnosis. A secondary outcome was condition-specific complications. Rates of possible delayed diagnosis and complications were determined. The association of volume with delayed diagnosis across conditions was evaluated using conditional logistic regression matching on condition, age, and medical complexity. Condition-specific volume-delay associations were tested using hierarchical logistic models with log volume as the exposure, adjusting for age, sex, payer, medical complexity, and hospital urbanicity. The association of delayed diagnosis with complications by condition was then examined using logistic regressions. Of 58 998 included children, 37 211 (63.1%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 7.1 (5.8) years. A total of 6709 (11.4%) had a complex chronic condition.

For 21 of 23 conditions (all except ectopic pregnancy and sinus venous thrombosis), there were decreased rates of possible delayed diagnosis with increasing ED volume. Condition-specific complications were 11.2% (95% CI, 3.1-20.0) more likely among patients with a possible delayed diagnosis compared with those without. EDs with fewer pediatric encounters had more possible delayed diagnoses across 23 serious conditions. Tools to support timely diagnosis in low-volume EDs are needed."

Physical examination revealed swelling and tenderness in the right inguinal region and no palpable testis in the right scrotum. Ultrasound and computed tomography revealed right testicular torsion, and emergency surgery was performed. Intraoperative findings revealed a dark and ischemic testis that was twisted at 180°in the right inguinal region. There was no improvement in blood flow even after the testicular torsion was released; therefore, right orchidectomy with left orchiopexy was performed. Although the incidence of testicular torsion is higher in patients with an undescended testis than in those with a normally positioned scrotal position testis, reports of testicular torsion associated with a retractile testis are rare."

The child was brought to the emergency department (ER) with a tender inguinal swelling and fever. Notably, there was no previous indication of an undescended testicle (UDT), and the scrotum was not examined in the ER initially. The abdominal radiograph was unremarkable, and an ultrasound of the groin was requested to investigate the nature of the swelling. The ultrasound yielded a differential diagnosis of direct or indirect inguinal hernia containing intestinal loops or a necrotic lymph node. Ultimately, scrotal examination and repeated imaging confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral UDT with torsion and suspected infarction on the right side. Both UDT and testicular torsion (TT) are prevalent genitourinary disorders. However, the occurrence of torsion in an undescended testis is not commonly observed or documented, particularly within the age group presented in our case. TT is a surgical emergency, and its prognosis relies on early recognition and management in order to salvage the testis. In this case, there was a missed examination opportunity; therefore, it is imperative for emergency physicians to routinely include scrotal examination as part of the physical assessment when evaluating children with abdominal or groin pain in order to promptly identify such cases."

    "title": "Hypothesis and Holistic Knowledge of Testicular Torsion Among the General Population of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.",
    "abstract": "Background Testicular torsion is a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention. It occurs when the spermatic cord, which carries blood to the testicles, twists, reducing blood flow and oxygen to the testicle. This can lead to tissue death and loss of the testis if not treated promptly. It is important to seek medical attention immediately when symptoms of testicular torsion arise, as prompt treatment can help prevent permanent damage to the testicle. This study aimed to explore the level of knowledge about testicular torsion among the general population in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Methodology A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted using a convenience sample recruited from the general population who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The data were collected from participants using an electronic pre-structured questionnaire. The researchers developed the questionnaire through expert consultation and after an intensive literature review. The questionnaire was reviewed by a panel of three experts for validation and applicability. After a pilot study, the reliability coefficient (Cronbach's alpha) was 0.74. The data were analyzed using SSPS version 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and presented as percentages and frequencies. Chi-square and logistic regression were conducted. P-values ≤0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results A total of 732 participants were recruited, most of whom were male (486, 66.4%), with ages ranging between 18 and 30 years (452, 61.7%). Regarding testicular torsion knowledge, more than half of the participants had good knowledge (406, 55.5%) and knew about the signs, symptoms, and risk factors of testicular torsion. There was a statistically significant relationship between age and knowledge (p < 0.001) and an insignificant relationship between sex and knowledge (p > 0.05). Conclusions The study participants were found to have good knowledge. Fortunately, most participants knew that testicular torsion is an emergency and they must immediately visit the hospital. With further awareness programs, the overall knowledge level can be improved."

    "title": "Torsion of Epididymal Cyst: A Case Report With Review of Literature.",
    "abstract": "Torsion of an epididymal cyst is one of the rare and least-known causes of acute scrotal pain. Epididymal cysts, when large, can undergo occasional complications like infection or, rarely they might undergo torsion, needing emergency surgery. We present a case of a 37-year-old gentleman with acute scrotal pain to the scrotum. Testicular torsion was suspected clinically, but sonography revealed a normal-appearing testis and a large left-sided epididymal cyst with internal echoes and dependent debris. A diagnosis of epididymal cyst torsion was suspected based on sonographic findings. Exploratory surgery showed a reddish, inflamed epididymal cyst that had undergone torsion on its pedicle. The cyst was excised leading to symptomatic relief to the patient. Due to the rarity of this condition, such cases are often misdiagnosed clinically as testicular torsion. Ultrasonography helps in aiding the correct diagnosis and the radiologist needs to be familiar with the radiological aspects of diagnosing torsion of epididymal cysts."

    "abstract": "As a benign disease, the incidence of epididymal cyst (EC) is 5%-25%, and it is relatively common in adults but rare in children. Although the pathogenesis of EC is still unclear, the symptoms of most asymptomatic patients can disappear with conservative treatment. EC torsion is even rarer in adults and children. Only ten cases have been reported in the literature, and we add this 3-year-old boy as the eleventh case of EC torsion. He was admitted to the hospital due to scrotum emergency without a history of EC or recent scrotal trauma. The ultrasonic examination revealed signs of an epididymal cyst. However, the pain and swelling of his scrotum were very similar to those of patients with testicular torsion, so we performed surgery on him. Therefore, EC torsion is very necessary to attract our attention as a differential diagnosis of testicular torsion in scrotal emergencies. Furthermore, our case is also the second youngest case of EC torsion."

    "title": "Degrees of Testicular Atrophy Following Orchidopexy for Testicular Torsion.",
    "abstract": "Introduction Testicular torsion is an urological emergency. It is a time-sensitive condition in which twisting of the spermatic cord and testicular blood supply occurs, causing acute onset severe scrotal pain. The incidence of testicular torsion is highest amongst prepubertal males; however, it can occur at any age. Every hour that passes from the onset of symptoms has been shown to decrease the salvageability rate of the torted testis. Another significant factor that impacts testicular salvage is the degree of torsion. Prompt surgical exploration of the scrotum and orchidopexy, if the testis is salvageable, is the mainstay of treatment. A major sequela following orchidopexy for torsion is the decrease in testicular volume. The aim of this study is to assess testicular volume loss post orchidopexy in patients who presented with testicular torsion, as well as to identify the significance of the degree of rotation and duration of torsion in post-fixation volume loss. Methods This is a retrospective study in which all patients who underwent scrotal exploration for a primary diagnosis of testicular torsion between June 1, 2016, to January 15, 2023, were reviewed. The information obtained included the patients' demographics such as age, duration of symptoms, and laterality. Ultrasound images were reviewed for pre- and postoperative findings which included confirmation of testicular torsion as well as testicular volume measurements. Patients were excluded if they underwent an orchidectomy, had a diagnosis other than testicular torsion once scrotal exploration was done, or did not perform a follow-up scrotal ultrasound. Additionally, patients who underwent an orchidopexy for undescended testis earlier in life were also excluded. For statistical analysis purposes, degrees of testicular torsion and time to surgery were classified into mild, moderate, and severe. Results A total of 109 patient records were reviewed within the specific time frame. Of these, 47 patients were excluded as per the exclusion criteria mentioned previously, which gave us a sample size of 62 patients. Our findings showed that increasing severity of the degree of torsion as well as the time for surgery have statistically significant (p-value <0.05) effects on postoperative testicular volume loss. However, it was noted that time to surgery has a more pronounced effect on the mean volume loss than the degree of torsion. Moreover, the analysis also showed that, on average, with every additional hour from the onset of symptoms to surgery, the approximate volume loss is 0.15 ml. However, once time exceeds the 4.5-hour mark, the mean volume loss is 0.4 ml for each additional hour. Conclusion The current study indicates that earlier surgical intervention and correction of torsion are associated with enhanced preservation of postoperative testicular volume. Both the degree of torsion and time to surgery influence mean volume loss; however, time to surgery has a greater impact on the mean volume loss. These results highlight the importance of early diagnosis and intervention in cases of testicular torsion to minimize the risk of long-term testicular volume loss."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a condition of ischemia due to blood flow disturbance, ischemia-reperfusion injury after the detorsion, and compartment syndrome with increased intratesticular pressure. If no improvement in testicular color and appearance is noted after the detorsion, the tunica albuginea incision can be performed to preserve the testis. Case 1: A 13-year-old male came to our hospital with left scrotal pain, and emergency surgery was performed six hours after the onset with the diagnosis of left testicular torsion. The left testis was externally rotated 180 degrees, and the testis remained poorly colored after the detorsion. The testicular color improved after the tunica albuginea incision. The defect of the albuginea was covered with a tunica vaginalis flap. One year after the operation, testicular size remained the same, and blood flow in the left testis was good. Case 2: A 16-year-old male came to our hospital with right scrotal pain, and emergency surgery was performed 10 hours after the onset with a diagnosis of right testicular torsion. The right testicle was internally rotated 180 degrees, and the testis remained poorly colored after the detorsion. The tunica albuginea incision was performed and covered with a tunica vaginalis flap after improvement of color. Six months after the operation, testicular size remained the same, and blood flow in the right testis was good. Testicular preservation was possible with tunica albuginea incision and tunica vaginalis flap for testicular torsion. However, the long-term effect of these techniques on testicular function is unclear, and long-term follow-up is likely to be necessary."

    "abstract": "Neonatal testicular torsion (NTT) is a rare but significant condition occurring within the first 30-day postbirth, leading to vascular compromise and potential testicular loss. This paper presents a case of NTT detected incidentally in a neonate with bilateral hydrocele, emphasizing the challenge of early diagnosis and management complexities. The infant underwent surgical intervention involving detorsion and bilateral orchiopexy but eventually required right orchiectomy due to necrosis. The paper highlights the prevalence of NTT in conjunction with hydrocele and stresses the importance of parent education and vigilant follow-up. Various diagnostic methods, primarily ultrasonography, and a range of management strategies are discussed, considering factors such as salvage potential, risk to the contralateral testicle, and surgical intervention's risks and benefits. The paper argues for individualized management, taking into account specific neonate conditions and parental preferences, underlining the essential role of informed and empathetic consultation. The case reinforces the urgent need for increased awareness, early detection, and carefully considered therapeutic approaches to prevent devastating outcomes like infertility and the necessity for lifelong hormone supplementation."

    "abstract": "To compare impact of day or on-call team, pediatric or adult attending, and patient age on testicular torsion management and outcomes. A retrospective study of patients with testicular torsion between 2012 and 2022 at a single institution was conducted. Variables impacting management time were assessed using univariate analyses. One hundred and thirty-four patients were included: 49 underwent orchiectomies and 84 underwent orchiopexies. There was no significant difference between efficiency of on-call vs day team regarding time to ultrasound or time to operating room (OR). There were no significant differences between pediatric vs adult attending surgeons for time to surgery, intraoperative length of surgery, or testicular salvage rates. However, when patients were stratified by age greater or younger than 18years, older patients had significantly longer symptom duration (91.9 vs 20.0 minutes, P = .005), time to receive an ultrasound from emergency room registration (152 vs 87 minutes, P < .001), time to OR from emergency room registration (268 vs 185 minutes, P < .001), and time to OR from ultrasound read (187 vs 123 minutes, P = .03). Older patients also had lower rates of testicular salvage approaching significance (orchiectomy rate 48.8% vs 31.5%, P = .057). While no significant delays in testicular torsion management were detected between management by on-call vs day team nor pediatric vs adult attending, increased age of patient was associated with delays in definitive surgical management. Greater index of suspicion for testicular torsion diagnosis in adult patients may improve the rate of testicular salvage."

    "abstract": "Testicular salvage rates for torsion are time-dependent1. Door to detorsion time has been identified as an independent testicular survival factor2. We describe an initiative to reduce door to incision (DTI) time for pediatric testicular torsion. An institutional multidisciplinary quality improvement initiative with a primary outcome of reducing DTI time for pediatric testicular torsion was developed with multidisciplinary stakeholders. Several process and balancing measures were used as secondary outcomes to help interpret and verify the observed change in DTI time. Interventions were implemented in cycles. Initial interventions standardized assessment of suspected torsion by Emergency Medicine utilizing a validated scoring system. A threshold Testicular Workup for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion (TWIST) score led to parallel notification of essential services for rapid assessment and case prioritization3. Subsequently, bedside ultrasound in the Emergency Department was implemented. Progress was tracked in a live dashboard and analyzed with X-mR process control charts and Nelson rules. These tools are used in quality improvement and process control to demonstrate the significance of changes as they are being implemented, prior to when traditional hypothesis testing would be able to do so. We aimed to increase the proportion of cases with DTI times under 4 h from 64% to >90% within one year. We observed 22 torsion cases prior to and 62 following initial implementation. The percentage of cases with DTI times under 4 h improved from 64% to 95%. At week 29, a shift identified a significant change on the X chart, with reduction in mean DTI time from 221 to 147 min. At the same time, a shift on the mR chart identified reduction in patient-to-patient variation. Mean time from arrival to Urology evaluation decreased from 140 to 56 min, mean time from arrival to scrotal ultrasound decreased from 70 to 36 min, and mean time from scrotal ultrasound to surgical incision decreased from 128 to 80 min. These improvements highlight the two key successes of our project: application of the TWIST score and bedside ultrasound for rapid assessment of suspected testicular torsions, and parallel processing of the evaluation and management. Implementation of a protocol for pediatric testicular torsion increased the proportion of cases with DTI time <4 h to 95%, decreased mean DTI time, and decreased variation. Our protocol provides a model to improve timeliness of care in treating pediatric testicular torsion."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion requires emergency surgery; thus, prompt and correct diagnosis is very important. Ultrasound with color Doppler is usually the first-choice modality for diagnosis; however, skill and experience are required for confident diagnosis. Recently, contrast-enhanced ultrasound for the diagnosis of testicular torsion has been reported, but there have been only a few reports. This study aimed to compare contrast-enhanced ultrasound findings in cases of testicular torsion and non-testicular torsion. Patients who underwent contrast-enhanced ultrasound for acute scrotum at our institution between April 2010 and January 2023 were divided into testicular torsion (n = 17) and non-testicular torsion (n = 16) groups. The respective contrast-enhanced ultrasound findings were retrospectively examined and compared. In 16 out of 17 cases of testicular torsion, the parenchyma of the affected testis was not enhanced. In the remaining case, reduced contrast enhancement was observed; however, it was still notably less than that observed on the unaffected testis. On the other hand, in all cases of non-testicular torsion (n = 16), the parenchyma of the affected testis was notably enhanced. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is considered an easy and accurate method for diagnosing testicular torsion."

    "abstract": "Ovotesticular (OT) disorder of sex development (DSD) is a rare condition that affects the development of reproductive organs and manifests in a wide range of phenotypic presentations. The clinical diagnosis of this condition is challenging because of its atypical nature, and the variability of presentation in 46,XX OT-DSD cases makes it a complex issue in medical practice. We report a case of a 13-year-old boy who presented with left scrotal pain. Further exploration revealed a tunica rupture without testicular torsion of the left testis, whereas the histopathological analysis of a nodule excised from the right testis indicated the presence of ovotestis tissues. A second nonemergent surgery preserved the testicular tissues as the ovarian tissue in both gonads was excised. After 22 months of follow-up, the patient's testes produced normal testosterone levels sustained over time without any exogenous supplementation. This case reveals that, in male children who present with an acute scrotal disease as adolescents, the gonads should be retained until the etiology is confirmed, and the possibility of OT-DSD should be considered."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a common urologic emergency and one of the causes of infertility in males. It has been reported that ligustrazine may decrease oxidative stress and reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury. This study aims to investigate the protective effect of ligustrazine in ischemia-reperfusion injury after testicular torsion-detorsion. First, 40 rats were randomly and equally divided into TMP (Ligustrazine) group, the Testicular torsion (T/D) group, the Sham (Sham operation) group, and Control group. The left testis of rats in the TMP and T/D group was rotated for 2 h. The TMP group was intraperitoneally injected with ligustrazine solution and the T/D and the Sham groups were injected with normal saline. The left testes of four groups were obtained for assay on the 4th day after the operation. Average level of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and catalase (CAT) were higher in Sham and Control groups than T/D group and TMP group. Conversely, average level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) was lower in Sham and Control groups than T/D group and TMP group. In contrast with the T/D group, SOD, GPX, and CAT enzymatic activities increased, whereas MDA and ROS content decreased in the TMP group (P < 0.05). Microscopic observation showed that the testicular tissue of the Sham and Control groups were basically normal. The TMP and T/D groups had significant testicular tissue damage, whereas the TMP group had less damage and apoptosis than the T/D group. The apoptotic index of germ cells in the TMP group (13.05 ± 4.41) was lower than the T/D group (30.23 ± 11.31) (P < 0.05) and higher (P < 0.05) than the Sham group (0.56 ± 0.29). So we found that Ligustrazine lowered ischemia-reperfusion injury after testicular torsion-detorsion by decreasing the reactive oxygen species and suppressing apoptosis."

This study aimed to determine the efficacy of testicular scintigraphy (TS) in confirming the clinical diagnosis of TT and how this imaging method correlates with the surgical findings. A retrospective cohort review of clinical data was performed for 68 patients referred for TS from January 2016 to December 2021 to rule out possible TT. The final diagnosis was confirmed at surgery for all those with TS positive for TT. The median age of the patients was 18.5 years, interquartile range of 15-31 years. Commonly presenting symptoms were pain (99%) and swelling (68%). Only 6% had history of trauma. TT was diagnosed by technetium-99m (99mTc)-pertechnetate in 35 (51%) patients all of whom underwent surgical exploration. Of this group, 7 (20%) had manual detorsion intraoperatively (intermittent torsion), in 20 (57%) missed (complete) torsion was confirmed and 8 (23%) had a necrotic testis. Of the remaining 33 patients with results negative for torsion, 10 were normal and 23 were diagnosed with either epididymitis 13/23 (57%), orchitis 3/23 (13%) or 7/23 (30%) with epididymo-orchitis. TT was more common in patients under 15 and 15-19 years (P<0.05). The mean presentation time was 5 days with a range of 1-30 days. The 99mTc-pertechnetate scan remains an effective investigation in the diagnosis of TT and may serve as a gate-keeper for surgery even in patients who present late for treatment."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a urological emergency. However, surgical detorsion of the torsed spermatic cord can cause testicular reperfusion injury. Although remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) has been convincingly shown to protect organs against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, little is known regarding the effect of RIPC on testicular torsion/detorsion-induced reperfusion injury. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effect of RIPC on testes after testicular I/R injury in a rat model in vivo. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly classified into 4 groups: sham-operated (sham), testicular I/R (TI/R), or remote liver (RIPC liver) and limb (RIPC limb) ischemic preconditioning groups. Testis I/R was induced by 3 h of right spermatic cord torsion (720° clockwise), and reperfusion was allowed for 3 hours. In the RIPC group, four cycles of 5 min of ischemia and 5 min of reperfusion were completed 30 min prior to testicular torsion. The ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 was administered intravenously at the beginning of reperfusion (1 mg/kg). The testes were taken for the oxidative stress evaluations, histology, apoptosis, immunohistochemical and western blotting analysis. Remote liver and limb ischemic preconditioning attenuated ipsilateral and contralateral testicular damage after testicular I/R injury. For example. RIPC reduced testicular swelling and oxidative stress, lessened structural damage, and inhibited the testicular inflammatory response and apoptosis. Furthermore, RIPC treatment enhanced testicular ERK1/2 phosphorylation postI/R. Inhibition of ERK1/2 activity using U0126 eliminated the protection offered by RIPC. Our data demonstrate for the first time that RIPC protects testes against testicular I/R injury via activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway."

Method We retrospectively analyzed all male patients who underwent TT surgery within the adolescent age group between 2015 and 2023. Healthy adolescent patients who initially presented or were referred to an HCF and were subsequently diagnosed at our hospital for TT surgery were analyzed, focusing on why they were not diagnosed earlier. Results A total of 11 patients aged 10 to 17 who were surgically confirmed to have TT at our hospital between 2015 and 2023 were analyzed retrospectively. These patients had been admitted to various public and private HCFs due to the sudden onset of symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, fainting, sweating, and walking difficulties during and after working hours. Four patients had previously been admitted to one HCF, while seven had been admitted two to six times to an HCF. All patients were healthy, and all but one had received age-appropriate education. However, only two of them had reported experiencing scrotal pain. Laboratory tests and/or radiological examinations were conducted on eight patients, and nine patients received medical treatment and/or prescriptions. None of the patients were initially diagnosed with acute scrotum. Conclusion Despite having unrestricted and free access to well-equipped HCFs, the early diagnosis and treatment of TT are not ensured. Factors contributing to this delay include patients' concealment of, or failure to fully disclose, scrotal complaints, as well as physicians' incomplete history taking and genital examinations. The physician's male gender was not found to contribute to an earlier diagnosis of TT. A mandatory genital examination should be included in the emergency assessment protocol for male patients."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a urological emergency caused by the loss of testicular tissue due to ischemic damage. Rapid diagnosis and urgent treatment play a crucial role in the management of testicular torsion. Manual detorsion can be performed at the bedside, thereby reducing the duration of ischemia. Recent studies have reported the use of point-of-care ultrasonography for diagnosing testicular torsion; however, no review article has focused on the ultrasonographic findings pertaining to manual detorsion. This review describes the diagnosis of testicular torsion and the ultrasonographic indications for manual detorsion. Spermatic cord twisting or the whirlpool sign, absence of or decreased blood flow within the affected testis, abnormal testicular axis, abnormal echogenicity, and enlargement of the affected testis and epididymis due to ischemia are the sonographic findings associated with testicular torsion. The following findings are considered indications for manual detorsion: direction of testicular torsion, i.e., inner or outer direction (ultrasonographic accuracy of 70%), and the degree of spermatic cord twist. The following sonographic findings are used to determine whether the treatment was successful: presence of the whirlpool sign and the degree and extent of perfusion of the affected testis. Misdiagnosis of the direction of manual detorsion, a high degree of spermatic cord twisting and insufficient detorsion, testicular compartment syndrome, and testicular necrosis were found to result in treatment failure. The success of manual detorsion is determined based on the symptoms and sonographic findings. Subsequent surgical exploration is recommended in all cases, regardless of the success of manual detorsion."

    "abstract": "Acute epididymo-orchitis (AEO) is becoming an increasingly common differential diagnosis in children with acute scrotal pain. It has been noted in adult men that SARS-CoV-2 has a propensity for involving the testis and epididymis, affecting sperm and testosterone production. Our literature search revealed only one case report of COVID-19 presenting with epididymo-orchitis in a child. We present three more children who presented with AEO, all recovering from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. This article reviews the post-inflammatory aetiology of paediatric epididymo-orchitis, and the propensity SARS-CoV-2 has for the testis. Two pre-pubertal ten-year-old patients presented to the emergency department with a 48-h history of gradual onset unilateral scrotal pain and increasing erythema of the ipsilateral scrotal skin. One fifteen-year-old boy was referred for ongoing symptoms four days following a diagnosis of AEO made by his General Practitioner. On further questioning, all three had PCR-confirmed COVID infection two weeks prior to the onset of their scrotal symptoms and had just ended their isolation period. A literature search was then performed using the keywords SARS-CoV-2, testes and paediatric acute epididymo-orchitis. The SARS-Cov-2 virus has a propensity for affecting the testis and epididymis. This puts patients at increased risk of acute epididymo-orchitis during COVID infections. The inflammation induced by the virus appears to affect the cells responsible for testosterone production and sperm quality. However, there is no evidence that viral transmission can happen via semen. SARS-Cov-2 infection can lead to acute epididymo-orchitis. Knowledge of this is clinically significant, firstly to avoid unnecessary surgical intervention due to a mistaken diagnosis of testicular torsion and secondly, due to the potential of the virus to affect sperm quality and testosterone production."

The current study explored which demographic and clinical characteristics can help distinguish between TT and TAT. We analyzed all children ≤16 years who underwent surgical exploration for AS. The patients were divided into Group 1/TT and Group 2/TAT. Ninety patients were included in the study (24 with TT and 66 with TAT). The peak incidence of TT was significantly higher than in the TAT group (p&lt;0.001). Scrotal pain was more prevalent in the TAT group (p=0.02), whereas systemic signs (nausea/vomiting and abdominal pain) affected more frequently the TT patients (p=0.003 and p&lt;0.001, respectively). The duration of symptoms was significantly longer in the TAT group (p&lt;0.001). The duration of symptoms in the TT cohort significantly impacted the testicular salvage (p=0.008). Color Doppler ultrasound (CDUS) findings of absent/decreased testicular blood flow in the affected testis strongly favored the diagnosis of TT (p&lt;0.001). The older age, shorter duration of symptoms, systemic signs, and CDUS findings can help distinguish between the two most common acute scrotum causes."

Torsion of undescended testes, inguinal herniated ovarian torsion, and purulent lymphadenitis are mimickers of this condition. If these mimicker lesions are misdiagnosed as incarcerated inguinal hernia, manual reduction usually fails, and edematous and erythematous changes may occur in these mimicker lesions due to manual reduction. For physicians in the emergency department, prompt decisions and familiarity with the sonographic appearance of different contents within an inguinal hernia are important to accurately diagnose these mimickers. In this case series, we present sonographic images of a typical case of incarcerated inguinal hernia (an 11-month-old male with right incarcerated inguinal hernia) and three cases of mimicker lesions (a 7-month-old female with herniated ovarian torsion, a 7-year-old boy with undescended testicular torsion, and a 2-month-old male with purulent lymphadenitis). The incidence of incarcerated inguinal hernia is reported to be higher in males (80%), on the right side (60%), and in infants and toddlers. This information is important for diagnosing mimicker lesions.

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency. It obstructs the blood supply to the testes, leading to testicular ischemia and necrosis. It presents with a sudden onset of severe unilateral testicular pain associated with nausea/vomiting, swollen scrotum, and high-riding testicles with an absent cremasteric reflex and negative Prehn sign. Prompt diagnosis of ischemic testicles using ultrasonography is challenging for emergency physicians. Color Doppler ultrasound may reveal a relative decrease or absence of blood flow in the affected testicle. The most specific ultrasonographic feature was the whirlpool sign of the spermatic cord. Manual detorsion should be performed as soon as possible before surgical intervention. However, manual detorsion may fail because of patient discomfort, incomplete torsion, and rotation of the testicle in a less common direction. We report a case demonstrating ultrasound-guided detorsion in a 14-year-old boy with right testicular torsion. The present case highlights the importance of incorporating ultrasound guidance into manual detorsion, which can improve the success rate of the procedure."

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic influenced not only the elective, but the acute surgeries also, all around the world. Some authors found more delayed cases and more orchiectomies performed in childhood because of testicular torsions during the pandemic. To examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the treatment of childhood testicular torsion and the frequency of semicastration due to torsion at the first author's institute. A retrospective observational cohort study was performed in a representative Hungarian centre. Boys under 18 years of age operated with testicular torsion were divided into two groups: before COVID-19 (BC; 01/07/2017-31/12/2019) and during COVID-19 (DC; 01/01/2020-30/06/2022) pandemic. elapsed time between the first symptom and arrival at the hospital (<24 h or >24 h), elapsed time to start the surgical procedure since the arrival to the hospital and the rate of semicastration were analysed. For statistical analysis, Mann-Whitney U and chi2 tests were used. During the study period, altogether, 100 patients (45 BC and 55 DC) were operated on testicular torsion. Statistically significant difference was found between the two timeframes: in the elapsed time from the first symptom and arrival at the hospital (p = 0.048). During the pandemic surgeries started earlier (1.5; 2.5 h) than before the pandemic (1.5; 3.25 h, p = 0.01). No difference was found in the frequency of semicastration between the groups (p = 0.594). Contrary to the literature, during the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with testicular torsion arrived earlier at the hospital, and surgeries were started earlier, than before the pandemic at the investigated institute. The reason behind this accelerated care pathway might be the absence of less severe cases during the COVID-19 period. When people are more prone to stay home, if it does not seem necessary to seek help for any kind of non-urgent medical problem. Orv Hetil. 2023; 164(35): 1367-1372. Bevezetés: A COVID–19-pandémia világszerte hatással volt nemcsak a tervezhető, hanem a sürgősen elvégzendő műtétekre is. Egyes tanulmányok több, későn ellátott gyermekkori herecsavarodást észleltek, illetve több semicastratio elvégzéséről számoltak be a járvány alatt. Célkitűzés: Célunk volt, hogy megvizsgáljuk a COVID–19-pandémia hatását a gyermekkori herecsavarodás ellátására és a torsio miatti semicastratio gyakoriságára az első szerző intézetében. Módszerek: Retrospektív, megfigyelésen alapuló kohorszvizsgálatot végeztünk hazánk egyik legnagyobb betegforgalmú intézetében. A 0–18 éves, herecsavarodás miatt operált betegeket két csoportra osztottuk: a pandémia előtt (2017. 07. 01. – 2019. 12. 31.) és a járvány alatt (2020. 01. 01. – 2022. 06. 30.) operált betegekre. Az első tünetektől a kórházba kerülésig eltelt időt (24 órán belüli vagy azon túli), a tünetek kezdetétől a műtétig eltelt időt és a semicastratiós rátát vizsgáltuk. A statisztikai analízishez a Mann–Whitney U-tesztet és a khi2-próbákat alkalmaztuk. Eredmények: A vizsgálat ideje alatt összesen 100 műtét történt, a pandémia előtt 45 és az alatt 55. Szignifikáns különbséget észleltünk: az első tünetektől a kórházban történő jelentkezésig eltelt idő (p = 0,048) és a kórházba kerülés után a műtétig eltelt idő szignifikánsan rövidebb volt a pandémia alatt (1,5; 2,5 óra), mint a pandémia előtt (1,5; 3,25 óra, p = 0,01). A semicastratiós rátában nem találtunk különbséget (p = 0,594). Megbeszélés: Az irodalommal ellentétben a vizsgált intézetben a COVID–19-járvány alatt a herecsavarodás miatt jelentkező betegek hamarabb jelentek meg kórházunkban, és ezt követően a műtétekre is hamarabb került sor, mint a járvány előtt. Következtetés: A pandémia alatti gyorsabb akut ellátás oka lehetett, hogy kórházunknak talán kevesebb, kevésbé súlyos esetet kellett ellátnia a járvány ideje alatt. A kevésbé súlyos betegek inkább otthon maradtak, és csak súlyos esetben kértek orvosi segítséget. Orv Hetil. 2023; 164(35): 1367–1372."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a condition characterized by the twisting of the testis and spermatic cord within the scrotum, resulting in the obstruction of venous return and subsequent swelling. If left untreated, the torsion can progress to block the arterial blood supply, leading to ischemia. Prolonged ischemia can result in testicular necrosis and decreased fertility. Recognizing the urgency of this condition, timely diagnosis and management are crucial. In this clinical case, a 16-year-old male presented with left-sided scrotal pain following a minor trauma. Despite prompt medical attention, the delay in seeking treatment resulted in irreversible testicular necrosis. The case emphasizes the urgency of diagnosing and managing testicular torsion to prevent serious consequences such as testicular loss and reduced fertility. It serves as a poignant reminder for healthcare professionals to remain vigilant in recognizing this urological emergency and advocating for timely intervention to optimize patient outcomes."

We report the factors predicting TT and consequent orchiectomy in children with SP. The data on patients (aged ≤18 years) who presented with SP to PEDs at 4 branches of the Chang Gung Hospital through 10 years were analyzed. In all, 256 pediatric patients presented with SP. Their mean age was 11.60 ± 4.61 years and 72.7% (n = 186) were aged 10 to 18 years. The pain was left-sided in 54.7% (n = 140) and the interval between SP onset and PED arrival was 22.45 ± 31.27 hours. Overall, 84 (32.8%) patients needed surgery and 72 (28.1%) had TT. Of the patients with TT, 28 (38.9%) patients needed an orchiectomy. After analysis, TT and consequent orchiectomy were associated with a longer interval between SP onset and PED arrival, absent of testicular ultrasonic blood flow, interval between SP onset and surgery of more than 24 hours, and a high degree of TT. None of them experienced recurrent SP symptoms or TT again. The rate of TT in patients presenting to PEDs with an SP was 28.1%, and 38.9% of the patients with TT needed an orchiectomy. Early diagnosis and intervention helped to prevent subsequent orchiectomy in pediatric patients with TT."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion refers to ischemia of the testicle due to twisting or rotation of the vessels supplying the testes. It is a urologic emergency requiring a high index of clinical suspicion and prompt surgical intervention with management aimed at avoiding testicular loss and resulting infertility. This paper gives an update on the current situation regarding this topic in low-income settings. The aim of this study was to determine testicular salvageability and its predictors amongst patients with testicular torsion at two tertiary African hospitals. This was a hospital-based multicentre longitudinal study at two tertiary hospitals in western Uganda. Patients with acute scrotum were enrolled and evaluated for testicular torsion. Those with confirmed testicular torsion underwent surgery and salvageability was reported as the primary outcome. Predictors for testicular salvageability were determined using backward binary logistic regression in SPSS version 22. During the study period, 232 patients with acute scrotum were enrolled. The mean age was 35.3 (SD = 20.4) years. Forty-one (17.7%) patients had testicular torsion. Only 16 (39.0%) of patients with torsion had viable testes that were salvageable. Orchiectomy was performed on 25 patients (61.0%). At multivariate analysis, a patient who presented after 48 h from the onset of symptoms was 34.833 times more likely to have orchiectomy compared to one who presented within 12 h [AOR = 34.833, (95% CI = 5.020-60.711), P < 0.001]. In this study, the testicular salvage rate was low. The only predictor of salvageability was the time from the onset of symptoms to presentation. All males should be sensitized about the clinical features of testicular torsion to ensure early presentation to increase salvage rates."

This study investigated the feasibility of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) for diagnosing TT in the pediatric emergency department (ED). We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients, aged 18 years or younger, who visited a university-affiliated hospital pediatric ED with acute scrotal pain without trauma history and underwent diagnostic ultrasounds between January 2010 and October 2022. This study included 731 patients (median age: 9 years), Of these, 315 (43%) were in the POCUS-performed group: 188 in the POCUS-only group, and 127 in the POCUS-and-RADUS group. The other 416 patients (56.9%) were in the RADUS-only group. In total, 45 patients (6.2%) were diagnosed with TT (19 in the POCUS-performed group and 26 in the RADUS-only group). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of POCUS for diagnosing TT were 94.7%, 92.9%, 46.2%, and 99.6%, respectively. The median time to perform POCUS was shorter than RADUS (23 versus 61 minutes, P < .001). The POCUS-performed group had a shorter ED length of stay than the RADUS-only group (93 versus 170 minutes, P < .001). Among the patients diagnosed with TT, performing POCUS first did not significantly delay the ED process, including time to operation (250 versus 205 minutes, P = .142). For patients with acute scrotal pain, evaluation performed by pediatric emergency physicians using POCUS performs well in screening TT, and can decrease length of stay in the ED."

Scrotal ultrasound showed absent blood flow on the left, consistent with acute testicular torsion. The patient underwent left orchiectomy due to the testis being unsalvageable. Later pathology confirmed lymphoblastic infiltrates. A malignancy of the testicles is rarely associated with torsion and, in the setting of leukemia, suggests widespread disease. Due to the risk of scrotal violation, an inguinal approach is preferable for surgical exploration of the testicles in patients with a history of leukemia."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is an emergent disease in urology, and there has been discussion of the treatment of testicular torsion. Testicular decompression has been established as a critical treatment for testicular compartment syndrome (TCS), which occurs after detorsion in a patient who is diagnosed with testis torsion. Until now, testicular fasciotomy and incision of tunica albuginea with tunica vaginalis flap (TVF) graft have been suggested for decompression, and some studies about the efficacy of TVF were reported. However, this method is time consuming and needs meticulous technique, so other methods such as orchio-septopexy are suggested. The objective of this clinical case report was to propose new surgical method using collagen fleece (Tachosil®) instead of tunica vagina flap. A 5-year-old boy with scrotal pain visited our hospital 24 h after symptom onset. After history taking, physical examination, and scrotum ultrasonography, he was diagnosed with testis torsion. Emergency surgery was performed after diagnosis. Following the incision of scrotum and fasciotomy, we covered his tunica albuginea with collagen fleece called Tachosil® instead of covering with TVF. Short-term follow-up showed normal blood flow in testis without a TCS. This is the first case report of using Tachosil® in testicular torsion surgery, and its advantages were already reported in other surgeries like Peyronie's disease. Our case suggests this new technique is an appropriate method because of its advantages including its cost-effective and time-saving characteristics. The main limitation is the short follow-up, so more studies are needed to provide a high level of evidence about its efficacy and safety."

In this study, we aimed to determine the outcomes of emergency scrotal surgical exploration of cases that raised suspicion of TT presenting to Salmaniya Medical Complex (SMC), Bahrain's largest secondary and tertiary care center. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study. The data were collected from the hospital's electronic medical record software (I-SEHA). The data included patient age, Doppler ultrasound (DUS) findings prior to any surgical procedure, type of surgical procedure, and the surgical findings of that procedure. Results Of the 198 patients who underwent scrotal exploration, 141 had presented with signs and symptoms suggestive of TT. The mean age of the patients was 22.3 ±9.3 years. Doppler imaging was performed preoperatively on 135 out of 141 (95.7%) patients. After scrotal exploration, 91.4% of the patients were found to have TT. The proportion of patients with salvageable testis was 78.7%. Conclusions The study found that surgical exploration remains the definitive method in the management of acute scrotum in TT patients. Our findings are in line with those from other similar studies and meta-analyses."

The aim of this study was to evaluate ChatGPT-4 as a decision support tool for selecting imaging examinations and generating radiology referrals in the emergency department (ED). Five consecutive clinical notes from the ED were retrospectively extracted, for each of the following pathologies: pulmonary embolism, obstructing kidney stones, acute appendicitis, diverticulitis, small bowel obstruction, acute cholecystitis, acute hip fracture, and testicular torsion. A total of 40 cases were included. These notes were entered into ChatGPT-4, requesting recommendations on the most appropriate imaging examinations and protocols. The chatbot was also asked to generate radiology referrals. Two independent radiologists graded the referral on a scale ranging from 1 to 5 for clarity, clinical relevance, and differential diagnosis. The chatbot's imaging recommendations were compared with the ACR Appropriateness Criteria (AC) and with the examinations performed in the ED. Agreement between readers was assessed using linear weighted Cohen's κ coefficient. ChatGPT-4's imaging recommendations aligned with the ACR AC and ED examinations in all cases. Protocol discrepancies between ChatGPT and the ACR AC were observed in two cases (5%). ChatGPT-4-generated referrals received mean scores of 4.6 and 4.8 for clarity, 4.5 and 4.4 for clinical relevance, and 4.9 from both reviewers for differential diagnosis. Agreement between readers was moderate for clinical relevance and clarity and substantial for differential diagnosis grading. ChatGPT-4 has shown potential in aiding imaging study selection for select clinical cases. As a complementary tool, large language models may improve radiology referral quality. Radiologists should stay informed about this technology and be mindful of potential challenges and risks."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a known urologic emergency condition and one of the common causes of infertility in males. Hence, prompt diagnosis and treatment play a crucial role in prevention of testicular injury. It has been observed that empagliflozin, a drug for management of hyperglycemia, has anti-oxidative properties against different pathologies, the most important of which are ischemia reperfusion related injuries. This study aims to evaluate the protective effects of empagliflozin on a testicular torsion injury in adolescent rats followed by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) phenomena. Thirty-six rats were randomly assigned into three groups including sham-operated group received all surgical procedures except testicular torsion-detorsion, torsion/detorsion + dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as vehicle, and torsion/detorsion + empagliflozin (10 mg/kg). Testicular torsion was performed for 2 h through rotating right testis 720° in the clockwise direction. Thirty minutes before detorsion, a single intraperitoneal dose of empagliflozin was injected to treatment group. Four hours later, orchiectomy was conducted for histopathological and biochemical examinations of testicular tissue specimens. The malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the torsion/detorsion animals was markedly greater than in the animals under sham operated procedure. Moreover, the testicular MDA levels in the torsion/detorsion + empagliflozin group were significantly lower than in the torsion/detorsion group. Also, significant decreases observed in catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase activities in the torsion/detorsion group in comparison with sham operated group. These values were significantly improved in the empagliflozin group. Furthermore, histopathological examinations also revealed severe testicular injury which were improved by empagliflozin administration. Empagliflozin prevented increases in oxidative stress markers and subsequently reduced the tissue injury induced by torsion/detorsion in the current study. It can be concluded that administration of empagliflozin before prevents I/R related cellular damage in testicular torsion, possibly via oxidative stress inhibition."

We retrospectively analyzed all cases of spermatic cord torsion surgically treated at a university hospital between January 2018 to December 2021. We evaluated the time intervals, including pain onset until the first presentation (D1), interhospital transference time (D2), pain onset until urological evaluation in a tertiary service (D3), urological evaluation until surgery (D4), and time from pain onset to surgical treatment (D5). We analyzed demographic and surgical data, orchiectomy rates, and time intervals (D1-D5). Torsions presented to the first medical presentation within 6h were considered early for testicular preservation. Of the 116 medical records evaluated, 87 had complete data for the time interval analysis (D1 to D5) and were considered the total sample. Thirty-three had D1 ≤6h, 53 had D1 ≤24h (includes patients in the D1 ≤6h subgroup), and 34 had D1 >24h. The median time intervals of the total samples and subgroups D1 ≤6h, D1 ≤24h, and D1 >24h were D1 = 16h 42min, 2h 43min, 4h 14min and 72h, D2 = 4h 41min, 3h 39min, 3h 44min and 9h 59min; D3 = 24h, 6h 40min, 7h and 96h; D4 = 2h 20min, 1h 43min, 1h 52min and 3h 44min; D5 = 24h 42min, 8h 03min, 9h 26min and 99h 10min, respectively.

    "abstract": "Because 8-10% of children in the emergency room present with acute abdominal pain, a systematic work-up is essential to rule out acute abdomen. This article highlights the etiology, symptoms, diagnostic workup, and treatment of acute abdomen in children. Review of the current literature. Abdominal inflammation, ischemia, bowel and ureteral obstruction, or abdominal bleeding are causes of acute abdomen. Extra-abdominal diseases such as otitis media in toddlers or testicular torsion in adolescent boys can also lead to symptoms of acute abdomen. Abdominal pain, (bilious) vomiting, abdominal guarding, constipation, blood-tinged stools, abdominal bruise marks, and poor condition of the patient with symptoms such as tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotonia up to shock are leading symptoms of acute abdomen. In some cases, emergent abdominal surgery is needed to treat the cause of the acute abdomen. However, in patients with pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporarily associated with SARS-CoV‑2 infection (PIMS-TS), a new disease causing an acute abdomen, surgical treatment is rarely needed. Acute abdomen can lead to nonreversible loss of an abdominal organ, such as bowel or ovary, or develop into acute deterioration of the patient's condition up to the state of shock. Therefore, a complete history and thorough physical examination are needed to timely diagnose acute abdomen and initiate specific therapy. HINTERGRUND: Etwa 8–10 % der pädiatrischen Notfälle präsentieren sich mit akuten Bauchschmerzen. Zum Ausschluss eines akuten Abdomens ist eine gezielte Abklärung notwendig. Dieser Leitartikel gibt einen Überblick über Ursachen, Symptome, Diagnostik und aktuelle Therapieempfehlungen des akuten Abdomens im Kindesalter. Review der aktuellen Literatur. Ursachen eines akuten Abdomens sind in der Regel eine abdominale Entzündung, eine Ischämie, ein Hohlorganverschluss oder eine akute abdominale Blutung. Extraabdominale Erkrankungen, wie eine Otitis media bei Kleinkindern und eine Hodentorsion bei jugendlichen Jungen, können auch Symptome eines akuten Abdomens auslösen. Leitbefunde sind Bauchschmerzen, (galliges) Erbrechen, abdominale Abwehrspannung, Stuhlverhalt, blutiger Stuhl, eine abdominale Prellmarke und ein reduzierter Allgemeinzustand mit Allgemeinsymptomen (Tachykardie, Tachypnoe, Hypotonie) bis zum Schock. In einigen Fällen ist eine (Notfall‑)Operation zur Fokussanierung bzw. zum Organerhalt notwendig. Ein „pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome-temporarily associated with rSARS-CoV‑2 infection“ (PIMS-TS) mit gastrointestinaler Beteiligung ist eine neue Ursache, die ein akutes Abdomen verursachen kann, bei der jedoch selten eine Operationsindikation besteht. Das akute Abdomen kann zu einem Organverlust (z. B. Darm oder Ovar) und zu einer akuten Verschlechterung des Allgemeinzustands des Patienten bis zum Schock führen. Zur rechtzeitigen und zielgerichteten Therapie sind daher eine aufmerksame Anamnese und Untersuchung notwendig."

    "abstract": "The aim of the study is to identify patient- and care-related factors associated with time to treatment for acute testicular torsion and the likelihood of testicular loss. Data were retrospectively collected for patients 18 years and younger who had surgery for acute testicular torsion between April 1, 2005, and September 1, 2021. Atypical symptoms and history were defined as having abdominal, leg, or flank pain, dysuria, urinary frequency, local trauma, or not having testicular pain. The primary outcome was testicular loss. The primary process measure was time from emergency department (ED) triage to surgery. One hundred eleven patients were included in descriptive analysis. The rate of testicular loss was 35%. Forty-one percent of all patients reported atypical symptoms or history. Eighty-four patients had adequate data to calculate time from symptom onset to surgery and time from triage to surgery and were included in analyses of factors affecting risk of testicular loss. Sixty-eight patients had adequate data to evaluate all care-related time points and were included in analyses to determine factors affecting time from ED triage to surgery. On multivariable regression analyses, increased risk of testicular loss was associated with younger age and longer time from symptom onset to ED triage, while longer time from triage to surgery was associated with reporting atypical symptoms or history.The most frequently reported atypical symptom was abdominal pain, in 26% of patients. These patients were more likely to have nausea and/or vomiting and abdominal tenderness but equally likely to report testicular pain and swelling and have testicular findings on examination. Patients presenting to the ED with acute testicular torsion reporting atypical symptoms or history experience slower transit from arrival in the ED to operative management and may be at greater risk of testicular loss. Increased awareness of atypical presentations of pediatric acute testicular torsion may improve time to treatment."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion (TT) is a medical emergency that requires immediate diagnostic evaluation. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) has the potential to provide spatially resolved oxygen saturation (sO2), which can serve as a valuable marker in TT diagnosis. We investigated the potential of PAI as an alternative method for TT diagnosis and testicular injury assessment. We measured sO2 levels in different degrees of TT models using PAI at various time points. Based on histopathological results, we found that the averaged sO2 per pixel (sO2®) and reduction of sO2® (rsO2) in twisted testicles had significant correlations with hypoxic conditions. Both sO2® and rsO2 exhibited excellent diagnostic abilities in detecting TT and identifying ischemia/hypoxia injury following TT. Furthermore, PAI-measured sO2 demonstrated favorable diagnostic capabilities in discriminating if the testicle had suffered irreversible injury. In summary, PAI presents a potentially promising novel approach in evaluating TT and warrants further clinical investigation."

This retrospective observational study includes 90 pediatric patients ≤14 years old with diagnosis of testicular torsion made at 2 tertiary centers between October 2020 and June 2022. Variables examined included age, presentation delay, surgical wait time, number of attempts at manual testicular detorsion, and manual testicular detorsion success. All patients finally underwent surgery, including contralateral testicular fixation. Outcomes included predictors of successful manual detorsion, testicular findings at surgery, and operation time. Mean (SD) age at diagnosis was 11.51 (2.64) years. Mean presentation delay was 11.76 (13.79) hours. Detorsion was attempted in 72 (80%) patients, resulting successful in 58 (80.5%). Surgical wait time after successful manual detorsion was 22.85 (16.94) hours. On multivariable analysis, successful manual detorsion was associated with a presentation delay<6 hours (odds ratios [OR] 0.154, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.036-0.655, P = 0.01) and absence of scrotal edema (OR 0.171, 95% CI 0.038-0.769, P = 0.02). Vice versa, a heterogeneous echo-texture (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.007-0.461, P = 0.007) and absent blood flow on Doppler ultrasound scan (OR 0.256, 95% CI 0.067-0.971, P = 0.045) were significantly associated with the likelihood of manual detorsion failure. In our experience, manual detorsion provided safe and effective emergency treatment for pediatric testicular torsion, especially in absence of edema and when presentation delay is <6 hours. This maneuver should be more widely attempted immediately after diagnosis as temporizing rescue."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion accounting for 25% of acute scrotal disease, is an acute surgical condition. Atypical presentations of testicular torsion may lead delay diagnosis. A 7-year-old boy was admitted to the pediatric emergency department with continuous and progressive left scrotal pain for 2 days, associated symptoms and signs included left scrotal swelling and erythema. The pain started 4 days ago as left lower abdominal pain which then migrated to the left scrotum. Physical examination showed left scrotum skin redness, swelling, local heat, tenderness, high-riding testis, absence of the left side cremasteric reflex and a negative Prehn's sign. Subsequent point of care ultrasound of scrotum revealed increased volume of the left testicle, inhomogeneous hypo-echoic left testis, and no detectable flow in the left testis. Left testicular torsion was diagnosed. Surgical examination confirmed testicular torsion showing 720° counterclockwise rotation of the spermatic cord with ischemic changes in the left testis and epididymis. The patient was stabilized and discharged after left orchiectomy, right orchiopexy and antibiotic therapy. Symptoms of testicular torsion may be atypical, especially in prepubertal age. Detailed history, physical examination, point of care ultrasound usage and timely urologist consultation and intervention are important for prompt rescue to prevent testicular loss, testicular atrophy, and eventual impairment of fertility."

    "title": "Parents' Awareness and Knowledge of Testicular Torsion in the Western Region of Saudi Arabia.",
    "abstract": "Introduction Testicular torsion (TT) is the most common urological emergency in children that requires immediate intervention. The prognosis of testicular torsion depends on the patient's time of presentation to the emergency department (ED), as well as on the time at which the diagnosis is established and treatment is initiated. Raising public awareness of testicular torsion, particularly among parents, plays a crucial role in preventing delay in presentation and reducing the frequency of orchiectomy. To this end, the study is designed to assess the level of awareness and knowledge of testicular torsion, as well as the response of parents to the scrotal pain of their children. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among parents in the western region of Saudi Arabia. Data was collected between the 23rd of November and the 22nd of December 2022. A simple random sampling technique was implemented. The data was collected and analyzed using SPSS software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results A total of 394 parents participated in this study. It showed that 13.5% of parents reported having a child with a previous experience of pain in the scrotum. Of them, only 25.4% previously heard about torsion of the testicles. Only 68.8% and 76.6% correctly reported that if the child complains of pain in the scrotum during working hours or over the weekend, they will drive him to the hospital immediately. Good knowledge about TT was significantly higher among children's fathers compared to mothers (66.7% vs. 33.3%) (p≤0.05).  Conclusion Testicular torsion (TT) represents significant morbidity among male patients and early identification is crucial to avoid the need for orchiectomy and all its prominent physical and psychological consequences. To improve children's well-being, we need to raise parents' awareness of TT and the potential future implications of this critical condition as it is not widely known in our community. Further studies evaluating the knowledge regarding testicular torsion among preadolescent and adolescent boys are warranted."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion (TT) is the most common urosurgical emergency in the case of acute scrotal pain. Early diagnosis, both clinically with imaging and emergent surgical exploration, is the key step in the salvage of testis and its management. A 12-year-old male with no known comorbidities came to the emergency department of our center with complaints of left scrotal region pain and swelling for 10 h. Left testicular tenderness and swelling with Phren's sign negative, Deming's sign positive, and absent cremasteric reflex. Ultrasonography showed coarse echotexture with a lack of obvious vascularity in the left testicle suggestive of TT and bulky left epididymis with bilateral hydrocele; left side greater than right. The patient underwent emergency left orchidectomy with right orchidopexy. Following this, he was symptomatically better, and the excruciating testicular pain and swelling subsided. Extravaginal TT is a rare presentation in pubertal age groups; however, whatever may be the types and causes, TT is a urological emergency that may lead to permanent ischemic necrosis. Delays in diagnosis should be avoided as this is directly related to the percentage of testicular salvage or loss. Prompt emergent surgical exploration is the cardinal point in management."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion (TT) is the result of spermatic cord twisting which can lead to significant ischemia, making it a time-sensitive surgical emergency. General surgeons in rural centers may lack the resources to adequately evaluate the viability of the affected testicle. Indocyanine green fluorescence (IGF) has been increasingly used to assess vascular perfusion in general surgery cases. In this case report, we show the use of IGF in a rural setting to assess testicular viability in TT. A 17-year-old male was transferred to our rural regional hospital emergency department for sudden and persistent right scrotal pain. The onset of symptoms was approximately 52 h at presentation. TT was diagnosed with a doppler ultrasound by a radiologist. Urgent detorsion surgery was performed. Intraoperative assessment of viability was unclear after the usual means and IGF helped confirm the absence of testicle vascularization and the need for orchiectomy. General surgeons in rural communities are called to manage TT with limited resources and experience. IGF is widely used in general surgery and urology. Animal studies and two case reports show potential benefits of IGF in TT. In our patient, IGF was useful to confirm without a doubt that the right testicle was ischemic and non-viable. In a rural setting with limited access to radiology and distant urology coverage, IGF is an excellent resource to determine intraoperative blood flow in TT with uncertain viability."

We changed our practice to include better preoperative utilisation of a clinical risk score (TWIST) and DUS. This led to a significant increase in the incidence of finding TT from 18% to 53%.

    "abstract": "Testicular pain or swelling, often referred to as acute scrotum, can have a number of causes and presentations. Testicular torsion is an emergency condition requiring early diagnosis and surgery to salvage the involved testis in order to preserve testicular fertility. The study is aimed to know the incidence, aetiology, and management of acute scrotal conditions with a particular focus on testicular torsion. Epididymorchitis, trauma, and scrotal cellulitis are other causes of acute scrotum which are managed conservatively after proper investigations. The authors retrospectively reviewed 10-year epidemiological data of all children age under 14 years admitted to the tertiary care hospital with the diagnosis of acute scrotum. Data were collected about the clinical history, physical examination, biochemical investigations, Doppler ultrasound, and management done. 133 children aged between 0 days and 14 years (mean age, 7.5 years) were found to have acute scrotum out of which 67 (50.37%) patients had epididymitis, 54 (40.60%) patients presented with Torsion testis, three (2.25%) had torsion of testicular appendages, eight (6.01%) had scrotal cellulitis and one (0.75%) presented with a strangulated hernia. Due to late presentation, testis could be salvaged in only eight of the 54 patients with torsion testis. The testicular loss was seen more in bigger children and those with signs of infection in blood reports and colour Doppler showing no blood flow in the testis. The study results indicate that non-recognition of the severity of paediatric acute scrotum results in late presentation leading to testicular loss. Timely diagnosis will require sensitization of the parents, primary care providers, and paediatricians for this grave condition which leads to permanent testicular loss."

    "abstract": "Torsion of the spermatic cord is a urological emergency that must be treated immediately with surgery, yet detorsion of the testis can cause testicular tissue damage because of ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. I/R injury is a complex pathophysiological process that may affect the functions of distant organs. Here, we examined whether testicular torsion/detorsion (TT) causes myocardial dysfunction. We next investigated the potential beneficial effect and underlying mechanisms of remote ischemic postconditioning (RIPost) on cardiac function after testicular torsion/detorsion. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to three different sets of experimental groups. Testicular I/R was induced by rotating the right testis to 1080° clockwise for 3 h followed by 3 h of detorsion. RIPost was induced at the onset of testicular detorsion by four cycles of 5-min bilateral femoral artery occlusion with 5-min reperfusion. Cardiac function was determined postdetorsion, and the cardioprotective effect of RIPost was examined. Testicular torsion/detorsion-treated rats had reduced serum testosterone levels, impaired systemic hemodynamics, elevated systemic inflammatory responses, and increased serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (α-HBDH), and cardiac troponin I (cTnI). However, RIPost attenuated remote heart dysfunction induced by testicular torsion/detorsion. Furthermore, RIPost enhanced the phosphorylation of ventricular signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3, which is a key component of the survivor activating factor enhancement (SAFE) signaling pathways. Inhibition of STAT-3 with Ag490 abolished the RIPost-induced cardioprotection and STAT-3 phosphorylation. Testicular torsion followed by detorsion may cause impaired cardiac function in rats. RIPost effectively attenuates this remote cardiac dysfunction. RIPost-induced protective effects may be mediated by the STAT-3 signaling pathway."

ICG-FI could not confirm blood flow in the testicular parenchyma; however, it could be detected in postoperative ultrasonography. Blood visualization of the tunica albuginea by ICG-FI may have potential criteria for testicular salvage.

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency that, with delayed treatment, may be associated with loss of the testis. It commonly presents with sudden onset testicular pain, vague lower abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Management often requires emergent surgical scrotal exploration, detorsion, and fixation or removal of the affected testis. Retrospective review of all the patients in a hospital covering the Muharraq district in Bahrain presenting with testicular pain. During the six-year period from 2015 to 2021, 48 patients with testicular torsion were managed, with a mean age of 18.4 (± 9.2) years. Most patients (54.7%) presented within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms. All 48 patients underwent a doppler ultrasound, which confirmed the presence of testicular torsion in 87.5% of patients, with a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 98.5%. Fourteen patients had non-viable testis on surgical exploration, with an average age of 16.6 (± 6.8) years and took an average of 13 to 24 hours to present to the emergency department after the start of pain. Most patients underwent scrotal ultrasound 60 minutes from the presentation to the emergency department and surgical exploration within 120 to 179 minutes. The rate of testicular torsion in patients who underwent diagnostic ultrasound at 60 minutes or more from presentation was 40%, compared to an overall rate of 29%. All detected cases of testicular torsion, except for one case, underwent bilateral fixation of the testes. Of those patients who underwent contralateral fixation, none presented with contralateral torsion, supporting the recommendation of contralateral fixation. Patients underwent comprehensive assessment of their complaint and emergent surgical intervention, including an ultrasound that did not delay the surgical intervention. We agree that clinical judgment is the primary tool for assessment of patients with acute scrotum and an adjunct emergent ultrasound does not significantly cause delays. We concur with the current recommendations for contralateral fixation and prompt surgical management as the anatomical anomaly is present bilaterally."

    "abstract": "Nowadays, there is confusing evidence in the literature regarding the association between seasonal variations and events of testicular torsion (TT). We attempted to assess the correlation between seasonal variations, including season, ambient temperatures, and humidity levels to onset and laterality of testicular torsion. We conducted a retrospective review of patients diagnosed with testicular torsion and confirmed surgically between January 2009 and December 2019, at Hillel Yaffe Medical Center. Weather data was collected from meteorological observation stations near the hospital. TT incidents were stratified into five temperature categories (< 15 °C, 15-20 °C, 20-25 °C, 25-30 °C, > 30 °C) and into two categories of humidity (≤ 50%, > 50%). Potential associations between TT and seasonal variations were investigated. Of 235 patients diagnosed with TT, 156 (66%) were children and adolescents and 79 (34%) were adults. In both groups, rate of TT incidents increased in winter and fall months. Significant correlation between TT and temperatures below 15 °C was observed in both groups; OR 3.3 [95% IC 1.54-7.07], p = 0.002 in children and adolescents and 3.77 [1.79-7.94], p < 0.001) in adults. The correlation between TT and humidity was non-significant in both groups. Among children and adolescents left-sided TT was observed in most of the cases, with strong correlation to lower temperatures; OR 3.15 [1.34-7.40], p = 0.008. Higher rates of acute TT were observed in patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) during the cold seasons in Israel. Significant association was observed between left-side TT and temperatures below 15 °C in the children and adolescents' group. Our findings suggest that there might be a predilection for TT occurrence in cold weather, particularly left-side laterality among children and adolescents."

However, the sensitivity of this investigation to identify torsion varies largely. This is due, in part, to a lack of guidelines on how-to perform the US and therefore training is necessary. The Scrotal and Penile Imaging Working Group of the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR-SPIWG) and the Section of Urological Imaging of the European Association of Urology (ESUI) established a joint panel of experts to standardize Doppler US investigation of patients with testicular torsion. The panel reviewed the available literature, identified accumulated knowledge and limitations, and released recommendations on how-to perform Doppler US in patients with acute scrotal pain. Diagnosis of testicular torsion is based on clinical evaluation and investigation of the cord, the testis, and the paratesticular structures. A preliminary clinical evaluation, including history and palpation, is necessary. Grey scale US, color Doppler US and spectral analysis must be performed by a sonologist with at least level 2 competence. Modern equipment with adequate grey-scale and Doppler capabilities are required. Standardization of Doppler US in suspicious testicular torsion is presented, with the aim to obtain comparable results among different centres, prevent unnecessary operations, and improve patient management."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a serious urologic emergency that can present with unusual or atypical history and examination. Classical pain from testicular torsion is of sudden onset, significantly severe, and is accompanied by nausea and vomiting. However, in some patients, the initial scrotal pain appears to considerably subside within the next few hours. In others, testicular torsion tends to occur while sleeping, and many patients recount a history of being woken up from sleep by intense pain. Furthermore, some patients in this subset can resume normal activities and even sleep through the night with little or no discomfort, without a perceived need for pain medications. Other patients initially experience mild pain, which worsens over time. Consequently, these patients are less likely to be evaluated immediately. In view of these atypical cases, the question remains unanswered regarding sleep as a predisposing factor for testicular torsion. This narrative review focuses on exploring the association between sleep and testicular torsion."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a condition in which a testis rotates around its longitudinal axis and twists the spermatic cord. This in turn results in a significant decrease in blood flow and perfusion of testicular tissue. During Testicular torsion, the testicular tissue is affected by ischemia, heat stress, hypoxia, and oxidative and nitrosative stress. The testicular torsion should be considered an emergency condition and surgical intervention (testicular detorsion ) as the sole treatment option in viable cases involves counter-rotation on twisted testes associated, when possible, to orchipexy, in order to avoid recurrence. Possible testicular detorsion side-effects occur due to reperfusion and endothelial cells injury, microcirculation disturbances, and intense germ cells loss. To discuss testicular torsion surgery-based methods, different time frames for testicular torsion induction, and the associated pathophysiology by emphasizing cellular and molecular events as well as different therapeutic agent applications for testicular torsion. We reviewed all original research and epidemiological papers related to testicular torsion condition. Testicular torsion causes germ cell necrosis, arrested spermatogenesis, and diminished testosterone levels, with consequent infertility. Among different involved pathophysiological impacts, testicular torsion/detorsion-induced ischemia seems to play the key role by leading the tissue toward other series of events in testis. Numerous studies have used adjuvant antioxidants, calcium channel blockers, anti-inflammatory agents, or vasodilating agents in order to decrease these effects. To the best of our knowledge, no previously conducted study examined therapeutical agents' beneficial effects post clinical I/R condition in humans. Different agents targeting different pathophysiological conditions were used to ameliorate the ischemia/reperfusion-induced condition in animal models, however, none of the administrated agents were tested in human cases. Although considering testicular detorsion surgery is still the golden method to reverse the testicular torsion condition and the surgical approach is undeniable, the evaluated agents with beneficial effects, need to be investigated furthermore in clinical conditions. Thus, furthermore clinical studies and case reports are required to approve the animal models proposed agents' beneficial impacts."

The study protocol was outlined in advance. The review has been conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA). The PubMed, PUBMED Central, PMC databases & Scopus followed by Google (Scholar & search engine) were systematically interrogated with the keywords TWIST score, testis and testicular torsion. Fourteen sets of data (n = 1940) from 13 studies were included; data from 7 studies (giving a detailed score-wise break-up) (n = 1285) were dis-integrated and re-integrated to tweak the cut-offs for low and high risk. For every 4 patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with acute scrotum, one patient will eventually be diagnosed with TT. The mean TWIST score was higher in patients with testicular torsion (5.13 ± 1.53 vs 1.50 ± 1.40 for those without TT). TWIST score can be used to predict testicular torsion at cut-off of 5 with a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of 0.71 (0.66, 0.75; 95%CI), 0.97 (0.97, 0.98; 95%CI), 90.2%, 91.0%, and 90.9% respectively. While the slider for cut-off was shifted from 4 to 7, there was a rise in specificity and PPV of the test with a corresponding decline in sensitivity, NPV, and accuracy. The sensitivity witnessed a sharp decline from 0.86 (0.81-0.90; 95%CI) @ cut-off 4 to 0.18 (0.14-0.23; 95%CI) @ cut-off 7. The area under the SROC curve for cut-off 5 was more than that for cut-offs 4, 6 & 7. TWIST cut-off of 2 may be used to predict the absence of testicular torsion with a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of 0.76 (0.74, 0.78; 95%CI), 0.95 (0.93, 0.97; 95%CI), 97.9%, 56.5%, and 80.7%, respectively. While the cut-off is lowered from 3 to 0, there is a corresponding rise in the specificity and PPV, while the sensitivity, NPV, and accuracy are compromised. The sensitivity witnesses a sharp decline from 91 to 35%. The area under the SROC curve for cut-off 2 was more than that for cut-off @ 0, 1 or 3. The sum of sensitivity and specificity of TWIST scoring system to ascertain the diagnosis of TT is more than 1.5 for cut-off values 4 & 5 only. The sum of sensitivity and specificity of TWIST scoring system to confirm the absence of TT is more than 1.5 for cut-off values 3 & 2 only. TWIST is a relatively simple, flexible, and objective tool which may be swiftly administered even by the para-medical personnel in the ED. The overlapping clinical presentation of diseases originating from the same organ may prevent TWIST from absolutely establishing or refuting the diagnosis of TT in all the patients with acute scrotum. The proposed cut-offs are a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Yet, the TWIST scoring system is immensely helpful in the clinical decision-making process and saves time-lag associated with investigations in a significant majority of patients."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion (TT) is a common urological emergency posing serious health problem in children. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of TT are very important for children to protect the affected testis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the historical features, physical examination findings, laboratory tests, and ultrasound examinations in children with TT, as well as to identify the predictors of testicular salvage in children. We conducted a retrospective record of clinical findings, laboratory data, ultrasound findings, operating results, and the results of follow-up in hospitalized children with TT from November 2004 to December 2021. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify predictors of testicular salvage. A total 102 hospitalized children who presented with TT were included. Patients were aged from 1 month to 16 years, with a median age of 7.71 years. TT is significantly more common in the winter. Of these patients, 77 torsions were left-sided, 24 were on the right side, and only 1 was on bilateral sides. Meanwhile, we detected that 88 children suffering from TT had intravaginal torsion of the spermatic cord, and the rest were outside. Anticlockwise torsion was found in 65 cases (63.73%) and clockwise torsion in 37 (36.27%). As a result, 60 underwent orchidectomy, while 42 had a scrotal exploration with fixation of the testis. Multivariate analysis showed that cause of TT, time to intervention, white blood cell (WBC), and mean platelet volume (MPV) were correlated with the risk of a surgical outcome. Only a small proportion of TT children received timely surgical management. Testicular salvage can be predicted by cause of TT, time to intervention, WBC, and MPV. Early scrotal exploration based on careful physical examination decreases the risk of misdiagnosis of spermatic cord torsion. A certain percentage of children with TT presenting with scrotal trauma or epididymo-orchitis should have their testicles checked to make sure that they do not have torsion, especially those who visit in the cold season."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a serious condition that carries with it a high rate of morbidity. This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of testicular torsion, including presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence. Testicular torsion is a urological emergency that occurs with rotation of the testicle along its supporting ligaments leading to obstruction of vascular flow. A key risk factor is the presence of a bell-clapper deformity. The most common population affected includes children in a bimodal distribution with the most cases occurring in the first year of life and between 12 and 18 years, although cases do occur in adults. Acute, severe, unilateral scrotal pain is the most common presenting symptom. Nausea and vomiting are common, but the presence or absence of a cremasteric reflex is not a reliable indicator of disease. The TWIST score may assist with clinical decision making in patients presenting with acute testicular pain but should not be used in isolation. If torsion is suspected or confirmed, consultation with the urology specialist should not be delayed, as outcomes are time sensitive. Ultrasound can be used for diagnosis, but a normal ultrasound examination cannot exclude the diagnosis. Treatment includes emergent urology consultation for surgical exploration and detorsion, as well as symptomatic therapy in the ED. Manual detorsion can be attempted in the ED while awaiting transfer or consultation. An understanding of testicular torsion can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this disease."

Twenty-three patients (31.5%) underwent POCUS (median age 14.1 years [interquartile range {IQR}: 11.4-15.9 years]), of which 14 (60.9%) were imaged by POCUS alone, whereas the remaining 9 patients (39.1%) underwent POCUS before RADUS. Thirteen of the 23 patients (56.5%) who underwent POCUS had intraoperative findings consistent with acute testicular torsion, whereas another 3 patients (13.0%) required manual detorsion in the PED before orchiopexy. Six patients required orchiectomy. All patients for which POCUS findings were suggestive of acute testicular torsion were correctly classified.The median length of stay from time to admission to orchiopexy for those who received RADUS only versus POCUS only was 184 minutes (IQR: 136-255), and 121 minutes (IQR: 80-202), respectively ( P = 0.036). Among the patients who experienced POCUS, the median length of stay for those who underwent RADUS in addition to POCUS compared with those who underwent POCUS alone was 202 minutes (IQR: 136-338.4) ( P = 0.031). Point-of-care ultrasound performed by pediatric emergency medicine physicians can be used to expedite surgical management and streamline the management of pediatric patients suspected of acute testicular torsion."

    "abstract": "Emergency imaging of the scrotum is part of routine medical practice. Indications include epididymitis/epididymo-orchitis, testicular torsion, trauma, tumors and infarction. Prompt diagnosis and management are needed to ensure optimal patient outcome. Ultrasound (US) is the initial, and often the only, imaging modality for testicular pathologies. Usually, B-mode and color Doppler US are adequate. In challenging cases, contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) facilitates final diagnosis or increases the examiner's confidence by confirming findings on non-enhanced US. This paper elaborates on the examination technique of CEUS for testicular pathologies, thereby showing its added value over baseline US techniques in the emergency setting."

    "abstract": "Testicular ischemia-reperfusion injury (TIR) is a urological emergency common among male newborns, children, and adolescents. Testicular injury and its consequences, such as altered hormone production, subfertility, and infertility, are determined by the duration and degree of testicular torsion. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to preserving the testes and fertility. Previous studies suggest that reactive oxygen species contribute to the pathogenesis of TIR injury, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Several drugs/plants reportedly exhibit antioxidative activities to protect against TIR. This review summarizes current studies on the role of antioxidants in preventing experimental TIR injury and discusses the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms."

    "title": "Protective effect of cerium oxide on testicular function and oxidative stress after torsion/detorsion in adult male rats.",
    "abstract": "Testicular torsion (T)/detorsion (D) can cause testicular injury due to the rotation of the spermatic cord and its vessels, therefore it represents an urological emergency that is surgically treated. Oxidative damage occurs in the testis and distant organs because of the overproduction of free radicals and overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines by reperfusion after surgery. Cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles, a material also known as nanoceria, have regenerative antioxidant properties on oxidative stress. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of nanoceria on testis tissues in testicular T/D in rats. A total of 24 rats were equally and randomly divided into four groups: Control, CeO2, T/D and CeO2-T/D groups. Left inguinoscrotal incision was performed in the control group. In the CeO2 group, 0.5 mg/kg CeO2 was given intraperitoneally 30 min before inguinoscrotal incision. In the T/D group, unilateral testicular T/D was performed through an inguinoscrotal incision and rotating the left testis 720˚ clockwise, which was then left ischemic for 120 min, followed by 120 min of reperfusion. In the CeO2-T/D group, 0.5 mg/kg CeO2 was given intraperitoneally 30 min before testicular T/D. At the end of the experiment, testis tissues were removed for histopathological and biochemical examinations. The samples were histologically examined, Glutathione-s transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), paraoxonase (PON) activities and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured via biochemical analysis methods, while the expression levels of p53, Bax and Bcl-2 were detected using immunohistochemistry. The present results revealed statistically significant inter-group differences in PON, CAT and GST activities and MDA levels. GST, CAT and PON activities were significantly higher, whereas MDA levels in the CeO2-T/D group were significantly lower compared with those in the T/D group. The T/D group had increased Bax and decreased Bcl-2 expression levels in their seminiferous tubules compared with the control and CeO2 groups. CeO2 treatment led to downregulation of Bax and upregulation of Bcl-2. The expression of p53 was high in the T/D group compared with that in the control and CeO2 groups, and was upregulated in all germinal cells. However, compared with that in the T/D group, p53 expression was significantly decreased in the CeO2-T/D group. The testicular injury score significantly increased in the CeO2-T/D group compared with the control and CeO2 groups. Rats in the CeO2-T/D group demonstrated significantly milder tissue lesions compared with those in T/D group. The present findings indicated that nanoceria may protect testis in rats against the harmful effects of T/D. Further studies are required to evaluate how CeO2 reduces oxidative stress and cell death in testis tissue that underwent T/D-related injury."

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic affected the volume and epidemiology of pediatric emergency department (ED) visits. We aimed to determine the rate of associated complications for 16 high-risk conditions in a Michigan statewide network of academic and community EDs during the pandemic. We conducted a cross-sectional study of pediatric ED visits among a network of 5 Michigan health systems during the pre-pandemic (March 1, 2019-March 10, 2020) and pandemic (March 11, 2020-March 31, 2021) periods. Data were collected from the medical record and included patient demographics, ED visit characteristics, procedure codes, and final International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes. Selection of codes for 16 high-risk conditions and diagnostic complications were identified using previously described methods. Characteristics of ED visits were compared before versus during the pandemic using χ2 and Fisher's exact tests. We used multilevel logistic regression to analyze covariates and potential confounders for being diagnosed with a high-risk condition or a complication of a high-risk condition. A total of 417,038 pediatric ED visits were analyzed. The proportion of patients presenting with 10 of 16 high-risk conditions (including appendicitis, sepsis, and stroke) was higher in the pandemic period compared with pre-pandemic (P < 0.01). Despite this, there was no significant increase in the frequency of complications for any of the 16 high-risk conditions during the pandemic. The adjusted odds of being diagnosed with appendicitis (pre-pandemic 0.23% vs pandemic 0.52%; odds ratio [OR], 1.19 [95% confidence interval, CI, 1.00-1.41]), diabetic ketoacidosis (pre-pandemic 0.16% vs pandemic 0.52%; OR, 2.40 [95% CI, 2.07-2.78]), intussusception (pre-pandemic 0.05% vs pandemic 0.07%; OR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.22-2.21)], and testicular torsion (pre-pandemic 0.10% vs pandemic 0.14%; OR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.18-2.28]) was higher during the pandemic. Despite a higher proportion of ED visits attributed to high-risk conditions, there was no increase in complications, suggesting minimal impact of the pandemic on outcomes of pediatric ED visits."

    "abstract": "Intrauterine testicular torsion is extremely rare and the exact cause remains largely unknown. It is the result of an ischemic insult intrauterine, which presents as either extra-vaginal or intravaginal testicular torsion. Urgent surgical exploration and fixating the contralateral testis is key in the management of this condition. We present here the case of a two-day old neonate with in-born right scrotal swelling admitted at Children's hospital. The patient was born at term via cesarean section at a private hospital. Upon arrival in the emergency department, he was well hydrated, pink at room temperature with good perfusion. Upon examination, the right testis was found to be enlarged, tense, non-tender visibly reddish with overlying skin excoriation. Trans-illumination was negative in right but positive in the contralateral testis. Both hernial orifices were normal. Doppler ultrasound of the inguinoscrotal area found the right testis to be enlarged (15.6*9.4 mm) and showed heterogeneous hypoechoic texture with prominent rete testis and no flow on color doppler analysis. An urgent scrotal exploration was undertaken. Intra-operatively there was frank necrotic right testis with intravaginal torsion of the testis and minimal hydrocele. A right orchidectomy and contralateral orchidopexy were performed. Intrauterine testicular torsion should be treated as a surgical emergency. We advocate early recognition of intrauterine testicular torsion, alongside surgical exploration and simultaneous contralateral orchidopexy."

    "abstract": "We sought to determine which demographic, clinical and ultrasonography characteristics are predictive of testicular torsion (TT) and to determine factors associated with time to treatment. We retrospectively reviewed all medical records of patients (0-17 years) with acute scrotal syndrome (ASS) who were treated in our hospital in Lithuania between 2011 and 2020. We extracted patients' demographic data, in-hospital time intervals, clinical, US and surgical findings. TT was determined at surgery or clinically after manual detorsion. Test characteristics of demographic, clinical and US findings for the diagnosis of TT versus other causes of ASS were determined. We performed a multivariate analysis to identify independent clinical predictors of torsion, and factors associated with surgical delay. A search of medical records yielded 555 cases: 196 (35%) patients with TT and 359 (65%) patients with other ASS causes. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age between 13 and 17 years (OR 8.39; 95% CI 5.12 to 13.76), duration of symptoms <7 hours (OR 3.41; 95% CI 2.03 to 5.72), palpated hard testis (OR 4.65; 95% CI 2.02 to 10.67), scrotal swelling (OR 2.37; 95% CI 1.31 to 4.30), nausea/vomiting (OR 4.37; 95% CI 2.03 to 9.43), abdominal pain (OR 2.38; 95% CI 1.27 to 4.45) were independent clinical predictors of TT. No testicular blood flow in Doppler US had a specificity of 98.2% and a positive predictive value of 94.6%. However, 75 (41.7%) patients with TT had normal testicular blood flow, yielding low sensitivity (58.3%) and negative predictive value of 81.3% for this US finding. In-hospital waiting time for surgery was longer in patients with TT with normal testicular blood flow by USS (195 min) compared with no blood flow (123 min), p<0.01. Higher orchiectomy rates were associated with longer duration of symptoms (p<0.001) and longer waiting time for USS (p=0.029) but not with false-negative US. Pubertal age, symptoms duration of <7 hours, nausea/vomiting, palpated hard testis, abdominal pain and scrotal swelling are predictive factors for TT. Time lost between symptom onset and seeking medical care, and between arrival and US are associated with the need for orchiectomy. Preserved blood flow in USS does not rule out TT and may contribute to delays to surgery."

    "abstract": "Since the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), stay-at-home orders and fear caused by the pandemic have had a significant effect on the timing and outcomes of testicular torsion. However, the evidence was limited since the study results were inconsistent. This study aims to examine the hospitalization rates, timing, and outcomes of testicular torsion in children before and during the pandemic. Using PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar databases, we conducted a systematic search and meta-analysis of studies reporting the timing and outcomes of children admitted with testicular torsion before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore possible sources of heterogeneity. The outcomes of 899 testicular torsion patients from eight studies were evaluated. Our study found an increased hospitalization rate for patients with testicular torsion (incidence rate ratio = 1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.27-2.03; p = 0.001). Despite a significant increase in the duration of symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic (weighted mean difference = 11.04, 95% CI: 2.75-19.33; p = 0.009), orchiectomy rates did not increase (odds ratio = 1.33, 95% CI: 0.85-2.10; p = 0.147). During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitalization rates for testicular torsion and the duration of symptoms among children increased significantly. Moreover, the rate of orchiectomy did not increase during the pandemic, indicating that pediatric emergency services have remained efficient and have prevented an increase in the number of orchiectomies performed despite pandemic-related closures and delays in transporting patients to medical care."

    "title": "Perinatal Testicular Torsion in Northern Ireland: A Nationwide 10-Year Review.",
    "abstract": "Perinatal or neonatal testicular torsion (PTT) is defined as testicular torsion within the first 30 days of life. PTT is a rare event, and bilateral PTT is even rarer. However, recent articles have advocated emergency bilateral exploration to exclude the catastrophic possibility of asymptomatic contralateral testicular torsion leading to anorchia. The aim of this study is to evaluate PTT in Northern Ireland (NI) using a nationwide population-based retrospective observational study. All boys in NI who underwent emergency scrotal exploration within their first 30 days of life for possible testicular torsion over a 10-year period (January 2010-December 2019 inclusive) were included. Intraoperative findings primarily evaluated included diagnosis and presence of synchronous or asynchronous (metachronous) contralateral testicular torsion. Secondary outcomes included correlation between intraoperative findings and any preoperative ultrasound scan (USS), and scrotal examination findings during postoperative outpatient follow-up. A total of 19 patients who underwent emergency scrotal exploration in the study period were included. An intraoperative finding confirming the diagnosis of PTT was reported in 14 (73.7%) patients. The incidence of PTT was calculated as 11.3 per 100,000 per male live births in NI, with bilateral PTT accounting for two patients (14.2% of all PTTs), divided equally between synchronous and asynchronous PTTs. Of two affected testes where preservation was felt appropriate intraoperatively, only one was still palpable at follow-up, producing a testicular salvage rate after PTT of only 7.1%. Testicular findings on preoperative USS were confirmed intraoperatively in five out of six patients, producing a concordance rate of 83.3%. This is the first nationwide population-based study to calculate more accurately the incidence of PTT, and bilateral synchronous and asynchronous bilateral PTTs, all of which seem to be significantly higher than previously estimated. However, in keeping with previous reports, this study confirms the poor salvage rate of testes undergoing perinatal torsion, and suboptimal concordance between preoperative USS findings and intraoperative diagnosis."

Despite guidelines being available, challenges remain in both diagnosis and management of the disease. This study aims to determine the adherence of urologists and residents in urology to the European Association of Urology (EAU) Pediatric Guideline on Testicular torsion. Both Dutch and European urologists, and residents in urology filled in a survey on testicular torsion. Information on demographics, diagnostics, and treatment modalities was retrieved from the questionnaire based on the EAU Guideline on Paediatric Urology. A total of 303 responders participated, of which 214 (71%) were from The Netherlands. Most (61%) responders treated three or more cases of testicular torsion in 2020. Ultrasound was used by 64%, followed by an attempt of manual detorsion by 38% (Summary Fig.). Importantly, 23% preferred not to perform emergency surgery after successful manual detorsion. A Winkelmann procedure was performed by 23%, without fixation of the test is using suture material. A large group of responders (30%) only fixed the contralateral testis by a proven testicular torsion. A feasible adherence to the EAU Guideline on Paediatric Urology in treating testicular torsion was reported using this survey, although not all recommendations are implemented as proposed. The fact that outcomes of the different diagnostic and treatment modalities are lacking might be a limitation in interpreting the results of this survey. Majority of the responders followed the EAU Guideline on Paediatric Urology in the diagnosis and treatment of testicular torsion. Ultrasound might contribute to diagnosing testicular torsion as long as this does not cause any delay for surgical exploration. Surprisingly, many urologists do not perform a surgical fixation of the testis after detorsion. Since a wide range of techniques and materials is used in case of surgical fixation, the guideline may provide in preferences for a unified policy among urologists."

Fifty Spanish and 51 French cases were analyzed. Statistical differences were logged in the two settings analyzed in performing ultrasounds, in the area where primary care was provided and with regard to settlement amounts. Diagnosis was late in 76.2% of cases. The medical action time from the onset of symptoms and Doppler testicular ultrasound in cases of questionable differential diagnoses is key to prognoses to save the testicles.

This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study of children under 21 years old visiting 13 community and tertiary emergency departments (EDs) with appendicitis, bacterial meningitis, intussusception, mastoiditis, ovarian torsion, sepsis or testicular torsion. Delayed diagnosis was defined as having a previous ED encounter within 1 week in which the condition was present per case review. Patients with delayed diagnosis were each matched to four control patients without delay by condition, facility and age. Conditional logistic regression models evaluated risk factors of delay. Complications were compared between by delayed diagnosis status. Among 14 972 children, delayed diagnosis occurred in 1.1% (range 0.3% for sepsis to 2.6% for ovarian torsion). Hispanic (matched OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.69 to 4.35) and non-Hispanic black (OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.21 to 4.79) race/ethnicity were associated with delayed diagnosis, whereas Asian and other race/ethnicity were not. Public (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.42 to 3.44) and other (OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.50 to 3.93) insurance were also associated with delay. Non-English language was associated with delay (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.69). Abnormal vital signs were associated with a lower likelihood of delay (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.25). In an adjusted model, Hispanic race/ethnicity, other insurance, abnormal vital signs and complex chronic conditions (CCCs) were associated with delay. The odds of a complication were 2.5-fold (95% CI 1.6 to 3.8) higher among patients with a delay. Delayed diagnosis was uncommon across 13 regional EDs but was more likely among children with Hispanic ethnicity, CCCs or normal vital signs.

To date, no laboratory markers have been shown to be useful for preoperative TT diagnosis. Our aim is to analyze the role of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a predictor of pediatric TT. A retrospective single-center case-control study was performed in patients with ultrasound suspicion of TT, in whom surgical testicular examination was performed between 2016 and 2020. Patients were divided into two groups according to the intraoperative findings: TT group (testicular torsion), defined as spermatic cord twisting on itself around its longitudinal axis at least 360°, and non-TT group (no torsion). Demographics, clinical, ultrasound and laboratory features at admission were analyzed. Sensitivity and specificity were determined by the area under the curve (AUC) represented on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. A total of 159 patients were included (117 TT group; 42 non-TT group), with no demographic or clinical differences. TT group patients presented significantly shorter median time since symptoms onset (4 vs. 8 h; p < 0.012). Laboratory inflammatory test were significantly higher in TT group: Leukocytes (10,900 × 103/μl vs. 7,980 × 103/μl; p < 0.001), neutrophils (8,050 × 103/μl vs. 3,350 × 103/μl; p < 0.001) and NLR (4.6 vs. 1.1; p < 0.001). In ROC curve analysis, NLR presented the highest AUC (0.903), significantly higher than all other laboratory and ultrasound parameters. NLR of 2.3 was the cut-off point with maximum sensitivity (86.9%) and specificity (94.8%). This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study to analyze the usefulness of NLR in predicting the diagnosis of TT in patients with clinical and ultrasound suspicion. The limitations are mainly derived from being a single-center retrospective study. For this reason, multicenter studies with a higher number of patients and prospective design may be useful to minimize these biases. The sample size of our study, although not large, has allowed us to identify significant differences between the distinct parameters analyzed as predictors of TT. However, the absence of other similar studies in pediatric patients has hindered the comparison of our results. NLR should be considered as a predictor of pediatric TT in cases with nuclear ultrasound suspicion that may help to anticipate the urgent surgical treatment in these patients."

Testicular torsion, which is defined as the rotation of the testis around itself at the level of the spermatic cord, may cause organ loss due to impaired circulation. It is recommended to detortion the testis within the first 6 h to prevent organ loss. The aim of the study is to examine the effect of Tunica Albuginea incision (TAI) made in addition to detorsion (DT) on the viability of the torted testis. The research has an experimental design. The study was carried out on three groups of rats (Sham, testicular torsion-(T-DT), TAI, and testicular torsion-detortion. After 10 days of follow-up, testes in the groups were taken for pathological examination. In the pathological examination, necrosis, ischemic changes, Johnsen score, edema, inflammation, and basement membrane thickening were evaluated and scored in all pathological samples. Necrosis, ischemic changes, edema, inflammation, and basal membrane thickening were found to be significantly less in the TAI group. Furthermore, the mean Johnsen Scores were significantly different between the T-DT (7.44±0.52) and TAI (8.60±0.51) groups. The results showed that the testicles in the TAI group were better preserved than the testicles, in which only DT was applied. It can be argued that in testicular torsion, the DT procedure is not sufficient to protect the testis, and it would be bene-ficial to add TAI to the procedure."

Sixty-two percent of patients presented within 12 hours in 2019 compared to only 37% during the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study found an increase in the number of patients presenting with acute scrotal pain triggering surgical intervention and the number of patients with testicular torsion. This is likely to reflect a decrease in patients able to access primary care assessment but may also be related to COVID-19.

The clinical data of 25 children who received treatment for cryptorchid testicular torsion between January 2010 and December 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. The median age of the patients was 64.5 months (range: 2 months to 15 years). All patients had unilateral torsion, and the duration of symptoms ranged from 3 to 192 h. Among the 25 patients, five underwent orchidopexy, while the remaining 20 underwent orchiectomy. After 6 months to 8 years of follow up, the 20 patients who had undergone orchiectomy had a well-developed testis on the healthy side. Four of the five patients who had undergone orchidopexy of the affected testis had well-developed testes bilaterally, while one experienced testicular atrophy. Cryptorchid testicular torsion is a rare urological emergency that displays a delayed presentation and is often misdiagnosed. Clinicians need to carefully review the patient's medical history and ultrasound findings and perform a thorough physical examination to make a correct diagnosis. Active testicular exploration is required for patients suspected to have cryptorchid testicular torsion, and the decision to perform orchidopexy or orchiectomy depends on the intraoperative situation."

The aim of this study was to evaluate 10 years of experience with testicular torsion, point out our pitfalls in diagnosis and management, determine our likelihood of performing orchiectomy for potentially reversible injury. Records of patients operated for testicular torsion in the last decade were reviewed retrospectively. Clinical findings, symptoms, type of surgery, accuracy of radiological evaluation, and the outcome were analyzed. Orchiectomy specimens were reevaluated and histologically graded to determine the existence of previously undetermined low-grade injury. In total, 107 children were operated for testicular torsion. Presentation included pain 96 (89.7%), scrotal swelling 48 (44.8%). Doppler ultrasonography was performed in 96 patients with false-negative results in 26 (27%). Testicular salvage occurred in 65 (60.7%) patients of which 6 (9.2%) developed subsequent testicular atrophy. Forty-two (33.9%) patients were treated with orchiectomy and histologic reevaluation, and grading of the specimens revealed 4 (9.7%) low-grade injury which indicates a potential of reversible injury. Seventeen (13.7%) patients had normal testicular anatomy in surgery. Surgical exploration is mandated in case of clinical suspicion for testicular torsion even with a normal flow Doppler ultrasound. Macroscopic evaluation does not always correlate with microscopic findings, and a decision according to it may result in excision of potentially viable testis.

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a relatively common urological emergency, which involves the twisting of the spermatic cord and its contents leading to ischemia to the testes, which usually presents as sudden, severe scrotal pain. In comparison, testicular neoplasms are far less commonly encountered in the emergency department as they often present as painless hard masses that grow slowly over longer periods of time. Extremely rare cases of testicular neoplasms present as sudden scrotal pain that causes a challenging task in the emergency department as physical examinations and ultrasound findings could vary and not be specific enough in confirming the diagnosis. In this case, we report a 22-year-old male who was referred from the emergency department (ED) as a case of testicular torsion from the presenting history; however, his physical examination and Doppler ultrasound findings were suspicious of testicular malignancy. The patient presented with a history of right scrotal pain for a few hours with no predisposing factors; however, examination and imaging were highly suspicious of an underlying neoplasm. The patient underwent an inguinal orchidectomy, and histology confirmed the presence of a germ cell tumor of varying components. In conclusion, a high index of suspicion for testicular torsion should always be present when a patient presents with sudden onset testicular pain; however, the differential diagnosis including testicular neoplasms should not be overlooked as it can change the management and outcome."

    "abstract": "Acute testicular torsion is a surgical emergency due to acute testicular ischemia. Manual testicular detorsion is a testis-saving, bedside therapeutic when performed correctly and in a timely fashion. This procedure is most commonly performed blindly with pain relief as the endpoint for detorsion. However, up to one-third of patients continued to show signs of residual torsion in the operating room even using pain relief as the stopping point for the procedure. We present a case demonstrating the utility of color Doppler ultrasound to confirm complete manual detorsion in a 14-year-old male with acute testicular torsion. The patient underwent 360-degree detorsion and had relief of pain; however, color Doppler demonstrated incomplete return of flow to the testis. After an additional 180-degree turn was made, color Doppler demonstrated complete return of normal vascular flow to the torsed testis. When it comes to testicular viability, timely restoration of blood flow to the testicle is of utmost importance. Manual detorsion is a non-invasive intervention that can be quickly and effectively performed at the bedside. Moreover, using color Doppler ultrasound guidance can ensure that physicians detorse in the proper direction and to completion, by providing instant visualization of restorative flow and ensuring reperfusion of the testis while awaiting definitive surgical management."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion represents a pediatric surgical emergency. In this 6-year study with 140 patients, prepubescent (<13 years) and postpubescent (≥13 years) males with testicular torsion were identified. Prepubescent boys had a longer symptom duration (P = .016) and underwent more orchiectomies (P = .005) compared with postpubescent boys. The risk of orchiectomy decreased by 15% per 1-year increase in age (P = .002). Boys who underwent an orchiectomy had a longer symptom duration (P < .001), were younger (P = .002), had scrotal swelling (P = .001), scrotal erythema (P < .001), higher degrees of torsion (P = .036), and more left-sided surgeries (P = .014) compared with those who had an orchiopexy. Postpubescent boys were 63% less likely to receive an orchiectomy versus an orchiopexy compared with prepubescent boys. Pediatricians should be cognizant of the age discrepancies between prepubescent and postpubescent males with testicular torsion and educate parents about the importance of urgent evaluation in the Emergency Department to reduce the likelihood of an orchiectomy."

    "abstract": "Scrotal and testicular masses can be broadly categorized into painful conditions, which include testicular torsion, torsion of the testicular appendage, and epididymitis, and painless conditions, which include hydrocele, varicocele, and testicular cancer. Testicular torsion is a urologic emergency requiring prompt surgical intervention to save the testicle, ideally within six hours of presentation when the salvage rate is about 90%. The Testicular Workup for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion score can be used to help physicians identify patients at high risk of torsion and those at lower risk who would benefit from imaging first. Torsion of the testicular appendage presents with gradual onset of superior unilateral pain, is diagnosed using ultrasonography, and is treated supportively with analgesics. Epididymitis is usually caused by infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or enteric bacteria and is treated with antibiotics, analgesics, and scrotal support. Hydroceles are generally asymptomatic and are managed supportively. Varicoceles are also generally asymptomatic but may be associated with reduced fertility. It is uncertain if surgical or radiologic treatment of varicoceles in subfertile men improves the rate of live births. Testicular cancer often presents as a unilateral, painless mass discovered incidentally. Ultrasonography is used to evaluate any suspicious masses, and surgical treatment is recommended for suspected cancerous masses."

However, the decision was made only by the surgeon's experience whether it has to be resected or not. Recently, indocyanine green (ICG) has become an excellent tool to identify biliary and vascular anatomy, and assess perfusion abnormalities in tissues. In this case report, we successfully salvaged the twisted testis, since the testicular blood perfusion was confirmed by means of intraoperative ICG (IICG) fluorescence imaging. A 14-year-old healthy male patient presented due to acute left testicular pain. The patient was diagnosed with TT and had immediate surgery. Macroscopically, the testis had stagnant blood flow and appeared to be dark colored. After manual detorsion, the testis remained cyanotic and with macroscopically poor blood flow. ICG angiography was performed under near-infrared light by laparoscopic camera to assess the perfusion of the affected testicle. An excellent ICG signal appeared after 45 s in the testis, and decision was made to be preserved. Therefore, left orchidopexy was performed to complete the operation. The patient had a good postoperative course and was discharged the day after surgery. Six months later, the testis did not show any shrinkage, and both sides of the testis showed the same size without any consequences. The blood flow in the testis was visually confirmed during the IICG fluorescence method. ICG fluorescence imaging may become an effective alternative to evaluate whether a testis can be preserved following TT."

However, after surgical reperfusion, oxidative stress factors cause to germ cell apoptosis. The study was planned to evaluate the efficacy of simultaneous use of Cyclosporine A (CsA) and Nortriptyline (Nort) to repair testicular damages in an experimental torsion/detorsion (T/D) rat model. Male rats (n = 112) were allocated into 7 groups 16 each in; (Group 1); Control group, (Group 2); T/D group, (Group 3-4); CsA 1 and 5 mg/kg, (Group 5-6); Nort 2 and 10 mg/kg and (Group 7); concurrent group, CsA (1 mg/kg) + Nort (2 mg/kg). Right uni-lateral torsion was inducted by twisting testis 720 degrees in the clockwise direction for 1 h. For short-term and mid-term studies, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzyme activities, caspase-3 level, histopathological changes and germ cell apoptosis were evaluated. Moreover, in long-term investigation, semen analysis was performed. After T/D induction, testis abnormalities both functional and structural were appeared. Pre- and post-treatment with CsA and Nort, separately, reduced MDA and caspase-3 levels, normalized antioxidant levels, ameliorate tissue injury and improved sperm criteria. The antioxidant and anti-apoptotic characteristics of CsA and Nort and their protective effects have been shown in our study. Concurrent administration of CsA and Nort in selected low-dose indicated a significant positive effect as compared to the individual drug interventions on the reversal of T/D induced oxidative stress in short-term, apoptosis, and histologic changes in mid-term, as well as semen criteria in the long-term appraisal."

We noted variation in the door-to-detorsion times for patients with TT at our institution and our orchiectomy rate was 25.8%. We aimed to decrease the mean door-to-detorsion time from 124.6 to 114.6 minutes or less over 12 months. A multidisciplinary team of pediatric emergency medicine, radiology, urology physicians, and nurses, was formed. Our key drivers were use of Testicular Workup for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion (TWIST) score, prompt urology consultation, and efficient transfer from emergency department (ED) to operating room. Our process measures were TWIST score documentation rate and early urology consultation rate, outcome measures were door-to-detorsion time and orchiectomy rate, and balancing measure was ultrasound utilization rate. Early urology consultation occurred when the ED provider documented telephone communication with urology, immediately after placing a testicular doppler ultrasound (TDUS) order and before TDUS result. Over 2 years, 45 cases of TT were diagnosed. TWIST score documentation was implemented and was sustained at 78%. This improved early urology consultations from 40% to 60%. The mean door-to-detorsion time improved from 124.6 to 114.2 minutes. There was no reduction in the orchiectomy rate or TDUS utilization rate. A quality improvement project to improve the timeliness of care for children with TT resulted in expedited ED care but did not impact the orchiectomy rate."

    "abstract": "The literature reported an increased avoidance of the Emergency Department (ED) during COrona VIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, causing a subsequent increase of morbidity and mortality for acute conditions. Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency, which can lead to the loss of the affected testicle if a delayed treatment occurs. As testicular loss is time-related, outcome was hypothesized to be negatively affected by the pandemic. The aim is to investigate whether presentation, treatment and outcomes of children with testicular torsion were delayed during COVID-19. Medical records of pediatric patients operated for testicular torsion of six Paediatric Surgical Units in Northern Italy between January 2019 and December 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided as for ones treated during (dC) or before the pandemic (pC). To reflect possible seasonality, related to lockdown restrictions, winter and summer calendar blocks were also analysed. For all cohorts, demographic data, pre-operative evaluation, operative notes and post-operative outcomes were reviewed. Primary outcomes were referral time, time from diagnosis to surgery and ischemic time, while secondary outcomes were orchiectomy and atrophy rates. Statistic was conducted as appropriate. A total of 188 patients with acute testicular torsion were included in the study period, 89 in the pre-COVID-19 (pC) period and 99 during COVID-19 (dC). Time from symptom onset to the access to the Emergency Department (T1) was not different among the two populations (pC: 5,5 h, dC: 6 h, p 0.374), and similarly time from diagnosis to surgery (pC: 2,5 h, dC: 2,5 h, p 0.970) and ischemic time (pC: 8,2 h, dC: 10 h, p 0.655). T1 was <6 h in 46/99 patients (46%) pC and 45/89 patients (51%) dC (p = 0.88, Fisher's exact test). Subgroup analysis accounting for different lockdown measures, confirm the absence of any difference. Orchiectomies rate was 23% (23/99) dC and 21% (19/89) pC (p = 0.861, Fisher's exact test) and rate of post-operative atrophy was 9% dC (7/76) and 14% pC (10/70), p = 0,44, Fisher's exact test. Despite worldwide pediatric ED accesses reduction, we reported that neither ischemic time nor the long-term outcomes in children with testicular torsion increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the available literature, few studies investigated the topic and are controversial on the results. Similarly to our findings, some studies found that timing and orchiectomy rates were not significantly different during the pandemic, while others reported a correlation to pandemic seasonality. Furthermore, in the recent pediatric literature it has been reported a delayed testicular torsion diagnosis due to shame in informing parents. Strengths of this study are the large numerosity, its multicentric design and a long study period. Its main limitation is being retrospective. We reported our large cohort from one of the most heavily COVID-19-affected regions, finding that referral, intra-hospital protocols and ischemic time in testicular torsion were not increased during to the pandemic, as well as orchiectomy rate and atrophy."

A single institution, prospective case series, from February 2020 to February 2021. All patients who received a bedside review by a urology doctor for acute scrotal pain were included. Urine dipstick results were pre-defined as having had an impact on the emergency clinician's diagnosis if it showed pyuria and/or nitrituria and the final diagnosis was epididymitis-orchitis or haematuria and the final diagnosis was ureterolithiasis. 139 patients presented to the emergency department with a complaint of acute scrotal pain. 85 (61%) were referred for bedside urology review. Median age of 17 years (P25 12 yrs, P75 31 yrs). 2.3% (n = 2) had proven testicular torsion, 28.5% (n = 24) had epididymitis-orchitis and 8.2% (n = 7) had ureterolithiasis. 68 (80%) of patients received a primary diagnosis of testicular torsion by the emergency department clinician. Following review by a urology unit doctor, 14 proceeded to scrotal exploration for concern of testicular torsion. 7 patients were diagnosed with ureterolithiasis, all of whom had haematuria on their urine dipsticks (100%, 95% CI: 59-100%), 100% of these urine dipsticks were initiated by the urology unit doctor following bedside review. 22 patients were diagnosed with epididymitis-orchitis. 8 of these had pyuria, nitrituria and/or haematuria on their urine dipstick (36%, 95% CI: 17-59%) and only one urine dipstick was completed prior to referral. 20.6% of patients perceived to have testicular torsion by the emergency department had a positive urine dipstick that aligned with their final alternative diagnosis (95% CI: 12-32%). A collection of clinical findings is required to diagnose the aetiology of acute scrotal pain. Information that can be easily, quickly, cheaply, and reliably collected, such as a urine dipstick, can assist in clinical decision making."

Our study determined that neither distance from our hospital nor transfer from an outlying hospital affected the orchiectomy rate. An expedited medical evaluation and surgery offer the best prognosis for salvaging the testes."

    "abstract": "The onset of sudden and intense scrotal pain exposes to several problems when it occurs in a young man in Africa. Among the possible etiologies, testicular torsion is the surgical emergency to rule out, because beyond 6 hours of evolution the functional prognosis of the testicle is concerned. The septic evolution towards a purulent melting, in case of exceeded torsion, is also possible. Of slightly lower incidence than in Western countries, lack of awareness of this pathology by local health actors, the precariousness or health isolation of certain populations in certain under-medicalized regions, contribute to diagnostic and therapeutic delays. This often leads to a pejorative development, loss of the testicle being directly correlated with the delay in treatment. Testicular torsion has thus been identified as one of the main causes of male infertility in Africa. However, clinical diagnosis and surgical treatment require few resources and remain accessible in an environment with low resources or in precarious conditions. Indeed, despite the contribution of ultrasound in certain situations, the clinical picture is at the center of the diagnosis and therapeutic decision making. At the slightest doubt, surgical exploration is necessary. The multi-tunic anatomy of the testicle facilitates its surgical fixation in the event of conservation, ideally by triangulation of single-strand non-absorbable thread. Simultaneous fixation of the contralateral testicle is currently the subject of debate in the literature. In Africa, the benefit/risk balance, taking into account in particular the difficulty of subsequent access to care, justifies, from our point of view, performing contralateral orchidopexy at the same time. Depending on the appearance of the testicle and, to a lesser extent, the duration of the evolution of the symptoms, orchidectomy may be necessary. This article describes the clinical picture of spermatic cord torsion and the orchidopexy technique. L’apparition d’une douleur scrotale brutale et intense pose plusieurs problèmes quand elle survient chez un homme jeune en Afrique. Parmi les étiologies possibles, la torsion testiculaire est l’urgence chirurgicale à écarter, car au-delà de 6 heures d’évolution le pronostic fonctionnel du testicule est engagé. L’évolution septique vers une fonte purulente, en cas de torsion dépassée, est aussi possible. D’incidence légèrement inférieure à celle des pays occidentaux, la méconnaissance de cette pathologie par les acteurs de santé de proximité, la précarité ou l’isolement sanitaire de certaines populations dans certaines régions sous-médicalisées, contribuent aux retards diagnostique et thérapeutique. Cela conduit souvent à une évolution péjorative, la perte du testicule étant directement corrélée au délai de prise en charge. La torsion testiculaire a ainsi été identifiée comme l’une des principales causes d’infertilité masculine en Afrique. Pourtant, le diagnostic clinique et le traitement chirurgical nécessitent peu de moyens et restent accessibles dans un milieu à faibles ressources ou en conditions précaires. Cet article reprend le tableau clinique de torsion du cordon spermatique et la technique d’orchidopexie."

Using national data obtained from the NHS Improvement, we aim to identify key suboptimal areas in the acute diagnosis and management of testicular torsion with a view to learning from these and improving outcomes. A freedom of information request was made to all 134 hospital groups in England and Wales that manage testicular torsion. Serious incidents experienced by these hospitals were analyzed to see whether those with pediatric emergency departments fared better than those without. In addition, a qualitative thematic analysis of the NHS Improvement National Reporting and Learning System database over a 12-year period (2007-2019) was undertaken, to identify common themes associated with orchidectomies and \"near-miss\" events in the pediatric population. Three hundred four patient safety incidents were returned and divided into 62 orchidectomies and 242 near-miss events. The most common factor in the orchidectomy group was individual factors (83.9%). Misdiagnosis of symptomatic testicle was not significant when comparing ED to specialist surgeons (odds ratio = 1.46, P = 0.3842). Atypical presentation resulting in orchidectomy was significant when comparing ED with specialists (odds ratio = 6, P = 0.0355). Near-miss events, not leading to orchidectomy, are often due to a wider variety of factors. A Mann-Whitney U test showed that there was no statistical significance in incidents when comparing general ED units caring for all ages with pediatric EDs in terms of incidents ( U = 807.5, z = -1.124, P = 0.261). There is a need for education in ED about atypical presentation of testicular torsion and examination of scrotum in cases of lower abdominal pain. It is also vital that specialist teams are cognizant of the standard operating procedures relevant to scrotal pain and testicular within the organization and the wider clinical network. Finally, there should be a drive for annual collation of data in urology and ED units with regards to testicular torsion as patient safety incidents may be underreported."

A search of case law was performed utilizing the LexisNexis caselaw database for the period of January 2011 through December 2021. Initial search results were reviewed by the attorney co-authors for relevance to medical malpractice surrounding PoCUS. The remaining cases were reviewed by physician co-authors to ensure their relevance to both ultrasound and the acute care setting. Identified cases were then classified into categories as per the reason for the claim. No cases of malpractice litigation were identified that directly related to PoCUS. Ten cases of ultrasound in the acute care setting were identified, 7 of which were in pediatric patients. The majority of these cases related to appendicitis or testicular torsion. Of these 10 cases, 2 cases claimed failure to consider the ultimate diagnosis, but ultrasound would have been an appropriate study had the diagnosis been considered. Of the 8 remaining cases, 6 were based on failure to perform or delay performing ultrasound, 1 claimed that improper ultrasound study was initially performed, and 1 case was based on an improper diagnosis made by ultrasound. PoCUS does not appear to pose a significant risk of malpractice litigation in pediatric emergency medicine."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is an emergency, mainly in newborn and adolescent males, resulting in testicular ischemia. The current study aimed to evaluate the effect of Idebenone (IDE) on testicular torsion/detorsion (T/D) in juvenile rats. Thirty-two rats were randomized into: (1) the sham group: rats received sham operations with no other interventions; (2) the IDE group: rats received idebenone (100 mg/kg, i. p) without T/D; (3) the T/D group: rats underwent torsion for 2 h and detorsion for 4 h; and (4) the IDE+ T/D group: rats received IDE 1 h before T/D. Testicular malondialdehyde (MDA), total nitrite/nitrate (NOx), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), caspase-3, sirtuin type 1 (Sirt1), serum interleukin-1β (IL-1β), total cholesterol, and testosterone were measured. Histological changes, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like-2 factors (Nrf2), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immuno-expressions were assessed. T/D displayed an increase in MDA, NOx, TNF-α, caspase-3, IL-1β, and total cholesterol with a significant decrease in TAC, Sirt1, and testosterone and strong positive Nrf2 and negative PCNA immuno-expressions. IDE could improve all oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic indicators. Therefore, IDE significantly reduced testicular ischemia-reperfusion injury in the juvenile rat testicular T/D model by limiting oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis via the Sirt1/Nrf2/TNF-α pathway."

    "abstract": "Previous studies have examined the utility of ultrasonography performed by radiologists for diagnosing paediatric testicular torsion. While point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is used in paediatric emergency medicine, its diagnostic accuracy is still unknown. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to clarify the accuracy of POCUS in diagnosing testicular torsion in children. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy guidelines, a systematic review was performed using the indices of MEDLINE, EMBASE plus EMBASE classics, PubMed and the Cochrane database from inception to November 2020. Any study investigating the diagnostic accuracy of POCUS for paediatric testicular torsion was extracted. The primary outcome was the assessment of the diagnostic accuracy of POCUS for paediatric testicular torsion. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Quality analysis was conducted using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). Four studies enrolling 784 patients in total were included. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios of POCUS were 98.4% (95% CI: 88.5% to 99.8%), 97.2% (95% CI: 87.2% to 99.4%), 34.7 (95% CI: 7.4 to 164.4) and 0.017 (95% CI: 0.002 to 0.12), respectively. Risk-of-bias assessment using QUADAS-2 revealed that two of the studies had a high risk of bias in patient selection. The present systematic review and meta-analysis showed that POCUS had high sensitivity and specificity for identifying testicular torsion in paediatric patients although the risk of bias was high in the studies analysed."

    "abstract": "We aimed to reveal the change of urological emergencies during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same period of the previous year. The number of admissions to the emergency department (ED), admissions to the urology outpatient clinic, emergency urological consultations, and urological and emergency urological surgeries during the periods April-November-2019 and April-November-2020 were recorded. The data of the COVID-19 period were compared with the previous year. While the number of admissions to the urological outpatient clinic was 160,447 during the COVID period, it was 351,809 during the non-COVID period. The number of admissions to the ED decreased from 3.2 million to 2.4. The number of admissions to the urology outpatient clinic significantly decreased by 54% during the pandemic (p=0.001). Percutaneous cystostomy performed due to acute urinary obstruction decreased by 27.96%, double J stent, nephrostomy decreased by 16.61%, and ureterorenoscopy decreased by 12.26%. Urogenital trauma also decreased. On the contrary, surgical procedures performed due to penile fracture, gross hematuria, Fournier gangrene, and testicular torsion increased. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decrease was observed in non-COVID patients' admissions to the emergency and urology department, and in urologic surgeries."

    "title": "Improving testicular examinations on paediatric patients in the emergency department: A quality improvement study to improve early diagnosis of testicular torsion.",
    "abstract": "Male paediatric patients presenting with abdominal and/or testicular pain are common in the emergency department. As a time-sensitive diagnosis, the importance of early recognition, referral, and definitive management is critical. Missed or delayed diagnoses and management of testicular torsion can result in significant long-term sequelae including impaired fertility and psychological burden. In this quality improvement study, we utilised educational posters aiming to improve awareness of testicular torsion as a differential for abdominal pain and therefore, improve the quality of testicular examinations performed in the emergency department. Observational pre- and post-intervention study was conducted at a tertiary hospital emergency department. A pre-interventional retrospective review of the electronic medical records was conducted. All male patients under 16-years-old presenting with \"abdominal pain\" or \"testicular problem\" were included. We assessed the rate of testicular examination and the quality of the examination based on four domains: Cremasteric reflex, lie, swelling, and hardness. Educational posters targeting both patients and clinicians were placed around the emergency department. Subsequent review of the electronic medical records post-intervention was performed assessing the same domains. A total of 235 presentations were analysed with 124 in the pre-intervention group and 111 in the post-intervention group. Overall rate of documented testicular examinations increased by 14% (p=0.032). The quality of testicular examinations also improved from an average of 0.85 domains documented to 2.29 post-intervention (p<0.001). Subgroup analysis found doctors in training had a greater improvement in both rate and quality of documented testicular examination. Our study demonstrated the value of continuing education in promoting awareness of testicular torsion in the emergency department. We found a clear improvement in the quality of clinical documentation of a time-sensitive condition which may infer a decreased risk of missed and delayed diagnosis of testicular torsion."

    "title": "Protective effect of osthole on testicular ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats.",
    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a urological emergency that requires urgent surgical intervention which results in testicular loss if not diagnosed and treated in a timely fashion. Ischemic tissue damage with oxygen deficiency, which starts with the decrease in blood flow to the tissue, continues to increase with the reoxygenation of the damaged tissues as soon as reperfusion is achieved. In various studies, osthole has also been shown to reduce cerebral, spinal cord, intestinal, renal, and myocardial ischemia/perfusion (I/R) damage. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of osthole on testicular I/R injury. 28 Wistar-albino rats were randomly divided into four experimental groups (n=7). Group 1 was the sham operation group. In Group 2 (I/R), 3-h ischemia was created by rotating the testis 720° clockwise, followed by 3 h of reperfusion. In Group 3 (I/R + single dose of Osthole), 20 mg/kg ostol was administered intraperitoneally half an hour before detorsion after 3 h of torsion. The testis was detorsioned. Three h of detorsion was applied. In Group 4 (I/R + twice doses of Osthole), 20 mg/kg ostol was administered intraperitoneally half an hour before detorsion, followed by 3-h torsion. The testis was released and detorsioned. Half an hour after the detorsion, an intraperitoneal dose of 20 mg/kg osthole was administered again. Detorsion was done for 3 h. All rats were sacrificed after 6 h and right orchiectomy was performed for blood for biochemical analysis and histopathological sample. Glutathion, nuclear respiratory factor 2, Superoxide dismutase, and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine levels were decreased in I/R rats, while interleukin-6, malondialdehyde, and myeloperoxidase levels were increased. While caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9, and TUNEL showed moderate immunopositive tissues immunohistochemically in rats with I/R damage, mild immunopositive tissues were detected in Group 3 and Group 4. In the histochemical examination, degenerative tubule structure and separation of epithelial cells were observed in I/R rats, while partially healed testicular tissue was detected in Group 3 and Group 4. In our study, we observed that osthole reduced oxidative damage, suppressed the inflammatory process, prevented apoptosis, and reduced cell damage. We think that with repeated doses, cellular damage would gradually decline."

    "abstract": "The worldwide spread of SARS-COV2 had led to a delay in treatment of numerous urological pathologies, even in emergency conditions. We therefore sought to determine whether the timing of diagnosis and treatment and the postoperative outcome of patients with testicular torsion had been changed during the COVID pandemic. We considered all patients evaluated in the emergency department (ED) for testicular torsion from February 2018 to August 2019 (pre-COVID period) and from February 2020 to August 2021 (during COVID pandemic). All patients underwent clinical and ultrasound evaluation and subsequently scrotal exploration. Primary outcomes were the time differences from pain onset to ED presentation and from ED presentation to surgical treatment. We also investigated whether the number or orchiectomies required changed during the pandemic. A total of 54 patients were divided in two groups: 40 patients in pre-COVID-19 group and 14 in the COVID-19 cohort. Mean time from symptoms onset to ED access was longer during the pandemic (4.2 ± 5.7 versus 39.6 ± 37.3 hours, p = 0.009). Mean time from ED access to surgery was similar (2.9 ± 1.1 versus 4.2 ± 2.3, p = 0.355). In addition, the number of orchiectomies was higher in COVID-19 group (2.5% versus 28.6%, p < 0.01), compared to a lower number of detorsions (97.5% versus 71.4%, p < 0.01). Elapsed time from pain onset to surgery was directly correlated with the increased white blood cell (WBC) count after surgery (r = 0.399, p = 0.002). The current study identifies a significant delay in presentation of testicular torsion which resulted in a significant increase in orchiectomies with the expected decreased in detorsion/orchiopexy. In addition, there was an increase in the WBC at presentation associated with delayed presentation."

    "title": "Does decentralisation of surgical management improve outcomes for paediatric testicular torsion?",
    "abstract": "In testicular torsion (TT), delayed emergency scrotal exploration (ESE) increases the risk of orchidectomy. Transfer of a patient with suspected TT from a district general hospital (DGH) to a paediatric surgical centre (PSC) delays ESE and potentially puts them at increased risk of testicular loss. Prior to 1st January 2017, all boys under aged <16 years presenting to a DGH within the East Midlands Clinical Network (EMCN) would be referred to the PSC. From this date, it was agreed within the EMCN that boys aged ≥5 years with suspected TT presenting to a network DGH would be managed locally, barring exceptional circumstances. Boys aged <5 years would be referred to the PSC for management. This study aimed to assess the impact of decentralisation of ESE for suspected TT on orchidectomy rates in the EMCN. All patients who underwent ESE under the care of paediatric surgery in the PSC, and all patients <16 years old who underwent ESE in 4 EMCN DGHs between January 2017 and December 2019 were identified. Neonatal cases and inpatient referrals were excluded. Comparison was made with published data on ESE performed in the PSC over the 9 years 2008-2016 prior to decentralisation. In the 9 years prior to decentralisation, there were 110 cases of TT in the PSC. In the subsequent 3 years, there were 40 in the PSC and 37 in the DGHs. The orchidectomy rate of boys with TT presenting to DGHs and undergoing exploration locally (16%, 6/37) contrasts with the rate in those transferred from DGHs to the PSC for exploration (58%, 15/26). The difference is highly significant (p = 0.00059, RR 0.28 [95% CI 0.13-0.63]) and indicates that in the EMCN, avoiding hospital transfer and performing ESE at the presenting DGH reduces the risk of orchidectomy by 72%. Decentralisation of the provision of ESE in boys with TT has resulted in a significantly lower orchidectomy rate in boys undergoing ESE in the presenting hospital than when transferred to the PSC. This study reinforces existing literature that demonstrates the effect of delayed ESE on orchidectomy rate, and supports the recommendations of national guidelines in the UK that transfer of boys to a PSC for ESE should only occur in exceptional circumstances."

We conducted an ambispective, observational study from January 2014 to December 2019. Baseline demographics, time of presentation, clinical features, and management details of all the patients of testicular torsion were recorded from the database. All the patients were followed up in the outpatient clinic for testicular size, hormone levels, semen analysis, and erectile function. Of 85 patients, only 67 could be contacted and included in the final analysis. Group 1(orchiectomy) comprised 44 patients, and Group 2(salvage) had 23 patients. Follow-up duration ranged from 2 to 6 years and mean follow-up was 42 ± 12 months. The median time to presentation was significantly higher in Group 1 (48 hours) as compared to Group 2 (12 hours). The rate of testicular salvage did not vary with age of the patients. Doppler ultrasonography of the scrotum detected 92.5% of all cases of torsion. Antisperm antibody levels were within normal range in all patients. Approximately 47% of patients in the salvage group developed testicular atrophy on follow-up. Serum testosterone level was significantly lower in Group 1 and the subset of patients with testicular atrophy. Rest of the hormonal parameters, semen analysis, and erectile function were comparable between two groups. The time between onset and presentation is an important contributing factor in guiding testicular salvage. Even after salvage, many testes may atrophy on follow-up. Orchiectomy and testicular atrophy in the long term have negative impact on serum testosterone. The patients should be counseled for a long-term follow-up for the risk of testicular atrophy and low testosterone levels."

    "title": "Effect of Cerium Oxide on Kidney and Lung Tissue in Rats with Testicular Torsion/Detorsion.",
    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency that results in testicular ischemia as a result of rotation of the spermatic cord around itself. Oxidative damage occurs in the testis and distant organs with the overproduction of free radicals and overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines by reperfusion after surgery. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of cerium oxide (CeO2), an antioxidant nanoparticle, on lung and kidney tissues in testicular torsion/detorsion (T/D) in rats. After ethics committee approval, 24 rats were equally (randomly) divided into 4 groups. Left inguinoscrotal incision was performed in the control (C) group. In group CeO2, 0.5 mg/kg CeO2 was given intraperitoneally 30 minutes before inguinoscrotal incision. In group T/D, unilateral testicular T/D was achieved by performing an inguinoscrotal incision and rotating the left testis 720° clockwise, remaining ischemic for 120 minutes, followed by 120 minutes of reperfusion. In group CeO2-T/D, 0.5 mg/kg CeO2 was given intraperitoneally 30 minutes before testicular T/D. At the end of the experiment, lung and kidney tissues were removed for histopathological and biochemical examinations. Glomerular vacuolization (GV), tubular dilatation (TD), tubular cell degeneration and necrosis (TCDN), leukocyte infiltration (LI), and tubular cell spillage (TCS) in renal tissue were significantly different between groups (p = 0.012, p = 0.049, p < 0.003, p = 0.046, and p = 0.049, respectively). GV and TCDN were significantly decreased in group CeO2-T/D compared to group T/D (p = 0.042 and p = 0.029, respectively). Lung tissue neutrophil infiltration, alveolar thickening, and total lung injury score (TLIS) were significantly different between groups (p = 0.006, p = 0.001, and p = 0.002, respectively). Neutrophil infiltration and TLIS were significantly decreased in group CeO2-T/D compared to group T/D (p = 0.013 and p = 0.033, respectively). Lung and kidney tissue oxidative stress parameters were significantly different between groups (p < 0.05). Renal tissue glutathione-s-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), and paraoxonase (PON) activities were significantly higher, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were significantly lower in group CeO2-T/D than in group T/D (p = 0.049, p = 0.012, p < 0.001, and p = 0.004, respectively). GST and PON activities were higher, and MDA levels were lower in group CeO2-T/D than in group T/D in the lung tissue (p = 0.002, p < 0.001, and p = 0.008, respectively). Discussion. In our study, cerium oxide was shown to reduce histopathological and oxidative damage in the lung and kidney tissue in a rat testis torsion/detorsion model."

    "abstract": "Pediatric testicular torsion is a urological emergency that requires timely intervention. In 2015, quality metrics for testicular torsion were implemented in the U.S. News & World Report \"Best Children's Hospitals\" rankings. Our study examines and compares testicular salvage surgery rates before and after the institution of national quality metrics from a multi-institutional database. The Pediatric Health Information System® was surveyed for all testicular torsion encounters using ICD (International Classification of Diseases), Ninth and Tenth Revisions coding from 52 hospitals between January 2010 and December 2019. Patients <1 year and ≥18 years of age were excluded. Only hospitals that reported outcomes before and after quality scoring were included. Testicular salvage surgery was defined as patients having undergone orchiopexy without concomitant orchiectomy. Age, race, distance from hospital, household income and insurance status were compared. A total of 890 patients (551 pre-metric and 339 post-metric) from 38 hospitals were included. The testicular salvage surgery rate was 12.5% higher in the post-metric cohort (70.9% versus 58.4%). Hospital compliance to testicular torsion quality metrics increased from 62% in 2015 to 98% in 2019. Mean age, race, distance to hospital, household income, insurance status and use of ultrasound were not statistically different between pre- and post-metric cohorts. Since the implementation of quality metrics, salvage surgery rates for testicular torsion increased to 70.9%, an improvement of 12.5% when compared to pre-metric outcomes. Patient factors were similar between the 2 groups. Multi-institutional prospective data are needed to validate this database study and evaluate overall testicular salvage rate."

    "title": "Chlorogenic acid ameliorates torsion/detorsion-induced testicular injury via decreasing endoplasmic reticulum stress.",
    "abstract": "Testicular torsion (TT) is an urological emergency situation especially in adolescents and young men. The main pathophysiology of testicular torsion/detorsion (T/D) is ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. I/R induces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) thought to play a critical role in tissue injury. Increasing evidence suggests that ER stress may play an important role in I/R-induced cell death. During ischemia, oxygen and glucose deprivation also causes abnormalities in protein folding processes. Antioxidants suppress oxidative stress directly as well as ER stress and thus gain importance in the treatment of pathologies associated with oxidative stress and ER stress, such as I/R damage. Chlorogenic acid (CGA) which is formed by the esterification of caffeic and quinic acids and is one of the most abundant phenolic acids in nature. There is also a growing body of studies reporting protective effects of CGA against I/R injury in different tissues, including intestinal, heart and brain. To investigate the effects of CGA on oxidative stress and ER stress in an experimental testicular I/R injury model. Rats were divided into three groups: control, T/D, and T/D + CGA. In the T/D + CGA group, 100 mg/kg CGA was given intraperitoneally 30 min before detorsion. While tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were determined manually using a colorimetric method, tissue superoxide dismutase (SOD), 78-kDa glucose regulatory protein (GRP78), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) levels were determined enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Johnsen's testicle scoring system was used for histological evaluation. In T/D group, tissue MDA, GRP78, ATF6 and CHOP levels were significantly higher than control group (p < 0.05). These increases were significantly reversed with CGA pre-treatment (p < 0.05). The histopathological Johnsen score was significantly lower in the T/D group compared to the control group, but the level of histopathological Johnsen score was significantly restored by CGA pre-treatment (p < 0.05). The relationship between I/R injury and ER stress has been emphasized frequently in recent years. This study in which the effects of CGA on TT were examined for the first time, showed that CGA can inhibit I/R-induced testicular damage. These results may provide a new insight into CGA and may form the first clinical theoretical basis for the possible use of CGA in the treatment of TT in the future. However, the real function of CGA in TT patients needs further investigation."

We identified males between ages one and 18 years who experienced testicular torsion over a six-year period (January 1, 2015-December 31, 2020). All patients were evaluated at our institution's emergency department by a pediatric urologist and underwent a Doppler scrotal US. Of the 140 patients with testicular torsion, 56 (40%) had a non-viable testis and underwent an orchiectomy, while 84 (60%) had a viable testis and orchiopexy. Testicular heterogeneity (47 [84%] vs 48 [57%], p = 0.001), epididymis heterogeneity (23 [41%] vs 21 [25%], p = 0.063), and scrotal wall thickening (25 [45%] vs 5 [6%], p < 0.001) were significantly associated with a non-viable testis. Epididymis heterogeneity (adj. odds ratio [OR] = 0.33 [0.13, 0.79], p = 0.013) and scrotal wall thickening (adj. OR = 0.08 [0.03, 0.24], p < 0.001) exhibited significantly lower odds for viability. Testicular heterogeneity and scrotal wall thickening were more likely to develop with a longer duration of symptoms (both p < 0.001). Our study determined that certain Doppler scrotal US findings, specifically, testicular and epididymal heterogeneity as well as a thickened scrotal wall, are associated with testicular demise in patients with testicular torsion. As testicular heterogeneity and scrotal wall thickening are more likely to arise with a longer symptom duration, an urgent diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention are imperative to avert testicular loss."

    "abstract": "The Testicular Workup for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion (TWIST) score is a 7-point tool to evaluate acute scrotal pain. Parameters include testicular swelling (2 points), hard testis (2), high-riding testis (1), absent cremasteric reflex (1) and nausea/vomiting (1). This review aimed to determine the diagnostic utility of TWIST and its role in risk stratification. A systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy was conducted. Five risk stratification systems were explored, including the Barbosa (0-2, 3-4, 5-7) and Sheth (0, 1-5, 6-7) scoring systems, to obtain sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating curve. Thirteen studies were identified, 9 prospective studies proceeded to meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy and 5 pediatric studies (1,060 patients, 199 torsions) were included in the primary analysis. The most accurate risk stratification system was Barbosa (0-2, 3-4, 5-7), with an AUC of 0.924 (95% CI: 0.865, 0.956). Barbosa showed favorable sensitivity in low-risk patients (0.984), facilitating rule out of torsion, and favorable specificity (0.975) in high-risk patients, facilitating urgent surgical exploration. Sensitivity and specificity in intermediate-risk patients were 0.922 and 0.682, respectively, indicating a need for further workup with ultrasound. Using this stratification, 65.2% of patients were low-risk, 19.9% were intermediate-risk and 14.9% were high-risk. Per 100 presentations of acute scrotum, there was a missed torsion rate of 1.6/100, ultrasound rate of 19.9/100 and negative exploration rate of 2.5/100. TWIST is an effective tool for suspected testicular torsion and is appropriate for widespread adoption. The Barbosa scoring system is reliable and reduces reliance on scrotal ultrasound."

    "abstract": "A myriad of pathologies can cause abdominal pain. Genitourinary causes including testicular torsion must be considered. In this report, we present a 17-year-old male evaluated in the emergency department for lower abdominal pain. After physical exam, computed tomography, and ultrasound were completed, torsion of undescended testicle within the inguinal canal was diagnosed. Surgical exploration revealed a twisted, ischemic testis, and subsequent orchiectomy was performed. This case highlights the importance of a thorough genitourinary exam in patients with lower abdominal pain."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a common urological emergency, mainly in the younger population. Our aim is to evaluate the efficacy and value of testicular echogenicity in predicting testicular viability. Patients who were older than 13 years of age and were discharged with the diagnosis of testicular torsion were reviewed. Data obtained included demographic data, history, physical examination results, ultrasound findings including size, color Doppler flow, and echotexture, torsion degrees, and surgical procedure. In addition, the histopathological findings of patients who underwent orchiectomy were reviewed. A total of 71 cases were diagnosed with testicular torsion between January 2016 to December 2018. The mean age at presentation was 20.4±7.0 years. The average time from the onset of pain until the presentation was 36.0±55.1 h. Out of the 71 ultrasound scans reviewed, 45.1% showed homogenous echotexture and 54.9% showed heterogeneous echotexture of the affected testis. On scrotal exploration, the mean degree of torsion was 475.7±301.8 degrees; 66.2% of the patients had a viable testis; and bilateral orchidopexy was done. The remaining 33.8% had a non-viable testis. Homogenous echotexture was after an average of 13.5 h of scrotal pain, while heterogeneous echotexture presented after 53.7 h of scrotal pain. There was a statistically significant difference between the time of presentation and echotexture changes on scrotal ultrasonography (p<0.01). The relationship between echotexture changes and testicular viability was statistically significant as well (p<0.001). A long time since the onset of pain coupled with heterogeneous changes in testicular parenchyma is a good indicator of non-viability. However, we still advocate for surgical exploration as the gold standard in diagnosis and management."

We aimed to evaluate the performance of scrotal US in diagnosing testicular torsion over the past 18 years in our institution and determine the factors contributing to the length of wait times for it. A retrospective review was conducted of boys who presented with acute scrotal pain from 2014 to 2015. US reports, operative findings, final diagnosis and key time points of the patients' journey (time to emergency department consultation, time to admission, time to US and time to operating theatre [OT]) were collected. US performance results were compared with those observed in a historical cohort from 1998 to 2004. Wait times were compared between operated and non-operated patients. Data from 519 boys with a mean age of 9.15 years was collected. Of these, 438 (84.4%) boys had undergone initial scrotal US; of these scrotal US cases, 28 were surgically explored, with 23 confirmed to have torsion. Another five cases were explored without prior US, and all were confirmed to have torsion. Performance analysis of US showed a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 98.8%. There was no significant difference between wait times of operated and non-operated patients. Time to US (P < 0.0001, r = 0.96) and time to OT (P < 0.0001, r = 0.64) correlated significantly with the total time from presentation to surgery. There has been an improvement in the diagnostic performance of scrotal US for testicular torsion over the past 18 years. Quality improvement programmes targeted at reducing wait times for patients presenting with acute scrotum should target time to US and time to OT."

    "abstract": "Healthcare disparities have been shown to impact outcomes of various acute pediatric conditions. We sought to examine the impact of race, ethnicity and insurance status on the presentation, management and outcome of testicular torsion. A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained testicular torsion database was performed. Patients ≤18 years of age evaluated in our pediatric institution's emergency room between April 2016-April 2020 with US diagnosed and OR confirmed testicular torsion were included. Basic demographics, timing of presentation, referral rate, time to OR and orchiectomy rate were extracted and compared. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 206 patients were included. 114 (56.2%) were Black or African American (Black/AA), 43 were (21.2%) Hispanic/Latino, 22 (10.8%) were Caucasian, and 24 (11.8%) were designated as Other races. Ninety-eight (48.3%) patients had Medicaid, 90 (44.3%) had private insurance, and 15 (7.4%) patients were uninsured. Sixty-eight (33.0%) presented in a delayed fashion (>24 h). Compared to the Caucasian patients, Black/AA patients were 2.1 years (95% CI: 0.5, 3.8; P = 0.010) older at the time of presentation. When compared to those with Medicaid insurance, uninsured patients had 6.26 times (95% CI: 1.58, 41.88; P = 0.021) higher odds to be referred from an outside hospital for management. In those patients presenting acutely (<24 h, N = 138), there were no significant differences in the odds of orchiectomy for Black/AA or Hispanic/Latino patients when compared to Caucasian patients, however, the odds of orchiectomy in Other races (non-Caucasian, non-Black/AA, non-Hispanic/Latino) was significantly higher (OR: 10.38; 95% CI: 1.13, 246.96; P = 0.049). While the mean time in minutes from ED to OR was longer in those with Medicaid insurance (141 vs 125.4 private vs 115 uninsured, p = 0.042), this did not impact orchiectomy rate (39.8% vs 40.9% vs 46.7%, p = 0.88). We found no differences in the orchiectomy rates by race with the exception of a higher rate in the diverse and heterogeneous Other race (non-Caucasian, non-Black/AA, non-Hispanic/Latino) group. Those uninsured had a higher referral rate highlighting the potential existence of disparities for those uninsured and the need for further investigation."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is still an urgent surgical condition and without any treatment it can cause infertility. The main pathophysiology of testicular torsion ischaemic injury however; the main sequalae of detorsion is reperfusion injury. Furthermore; treatments to prevent ischemic reperfusion injury due to decreased blood flow are important to preserve testicular function. Human chorionic gonadotropin β (β-hCG) is an anabolic hormone that supports steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis. Vitamin C (Vit-C) is one of the water-soluble vitamins and is also a potent antioxidant in ischemic damage. Moreover, it has protective effects by increasing blood and lymph flow in the testicles. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of β-hCG, Vit-C and their combination on ischemic reperfusion injury occurring after surgical treatment of testicular torsion. Animal research studies. The study was performed on 25 male Wistar albino rats. The animals were divided equally into 5 groups. In the first group \"Control Group,\" left orchiectomy was performed. In the second group \"Sham Group,\" a 720° clockwise torsion was created and after 4 h of left testicular torsion it was detorsioned for 4 h and then left orchiectomy was performed. In the third group same procedure was applied with 30 mg vitamin C was administered via intraperitoneal route once a week for 3 weeks. In the fourth group after same surgical procedures 75 IU β-hCG was administered via intraperitoneal route once a week for 3 weeks. In the fifth group after 4 h left testicle torsion it was detorsioned for 4 h then, 75 IU β-hCG and vitamin C together were administered via intraperitoneal route once a week for 3 weeks. Left orchiectomy was performed after 3 weeks in the third, fourth and fifth groups. Specimens were evaluated histologically. Testicular tissue histopathological evaluations were performed. A high histopathological stage indicates more testicular damage, and a low one was indicated less testicular damage. The average histopathological grade of vitamin C + β-hCG group was significantly higher than the average histopathological grade of the control, the sham group and vitamin C group. The average histopathological grade of the vitamin C group was significantly lower than the average histopathological grade of sham and β-hCG groups. The ratio of the testicular atrophy of the Vitamin C + β-hCG group (100%) was higher than sham (40%) and β-hCG (40%) groups with a significant difference. A significant statistical difference was found among all groups histopathological grades of testicular tissue. In animals taking vitamin C, an improvement of histopathological findings and a significant decrease in histological stages has been provided. However, it was observed that the histological findings of β-hCG and β-hCG + vitamin C groups worsened. It was found that β-hCG increased oxidative damage in the testicles and this damage can be so severe that exceeding the capacity of potent antioxidants such as Vitamin C. We believe that β-hCG can be harmful to testicles exposed to oxidative damage."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a condition that often occurs as a result of the rotation of the spermatic cord in childhood and adolescence in men, manifests with acute pain and causes infertility in the future even if emergency intervention is performed. The aim of this study is to investigate the protective and preventive effects of fentanyl, a potent analgesic agent frequently used in anaesthesia practice, on testicular ischemia reperfusion injury, which manifests through acute pain. A total of 16 adult male Wistar rats, weighing 200-250 g, were used in this study. They were divided into two groups, consisting of eight animals in each group. Torsion was created in all rats by rotating left testicles 720 clockwise on the day of the experiment. 3 mM of fentanyl was applied intraperitoneally 30 minutes before detorsion to the fentanyl group. Following an hour of ischemia, the left testicle was reinstated, and tissues were repaired according to their physiology. Following 24 hours of reperfusion, the animals were euthanised after taking left testes and blood samples. Fentanyl, administered prior to testicular detorsion, significantly suppressed germ cell damage in torsioned tissue, catalase activity and malondialdehyde levels in blood samples taken from the heart. No significant differences were observed in plasma total thiol concentration, histological score, Leydig cell counts, percentage of necrosis and tubule rupture. These findings show that fentanyl administered before detortion creates a protective effect by preventing testicular ischemia reperfusion injury leading to infertility in the future."

Systematic search of four scientific databases was performed. The search terms used were (coronavirus OR novel coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2 OR COVID-19) AND (testicular torsion OR orchidectomy OR orchiectomy OR orchidopexy OR orchiopexy). The inclusion criteria were all boys presenting with testicular torsion during the COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 periods. A comparison of the average duration of symptoms, the proportion of children with delayed presentation (>24 h), and the proportion of children requiring orchiectomy was made among the two groups. The Downs and Black scale was used for methodological quality assessment. The present meta-analysis included six comparative studies (five retrospective studies). A total of 711 patients (473 during the COVID-19 period) were included. No significant differences in the average duration of symptoms (WMD: 2.6, 95% CI -6.78 to 11.99, P = 0.59), the proportion of children with delayed presentation (RR = 1.03, 95% CI 0.52-2.02, p = 0.94), and orchiectomy rate (RR = 1.23, 95% CI 0.82-1.84, p = 0.31) were observed among the two patient groups. All studies had a moderate risk of bias. The duration of symptoms, the proportion of children with delayed presentation, and orchiectomy rate did not significantly differ among the children with testicular torsion presenting during the COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 periods. However, due to the moderate risk of bias, the level of evidence of the available comparative studies is limited."

    "abstract": "Ultrasonography is an effective diagnostic tool for testicular torsion (TT), which is typically characterized by the absence of blood flow in the affected testicle on color Doppler mode. However, there are a few reported cases of TT with symmetrical preserved flow. We report a case of TT with the preserved intratesticular flow on color Doppler ultrasound. A 14-year-old boy was admitted due to sudden-onset right scrotal pain. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) revealed that the right testicle was larger than the left. The intratesticular flow in both testicles was preserved. Radiology-performed ultrasound confirmed the preserved intratesticular flow observed on POCUS, but also demonstrated a whirlpool sign of the right spermatic cord. TT was confirmed surgically. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Emergency physicians should investigate the presence of intratesticular blood flow and the whirlpool sign of the spermatic cord or other ultrasound features suggestive of TT, even if testicular blood flow is preserved. Suspicion of TT from POCUS findings warrants further evaluation to preserve the patient's fertility."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is an important and critical issue in patients with acute scrotum referring to emergency department (ED). Early detection is very important to save the testicles. This study aimed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of clinical variables in predicting the presence of testicular torsion. This prospective cross-sectional study was done using the information of patients hospitalized from September 2015 to September 2020, with complaint of acute scrotum (ICD 10 code: N50.8), referring to ED for evaluation of the clinical predictors of testicular torsions, which were confirmed by surgery. 81 patients with the mean age of 20.07 ± 9.64 (3- 45) years were studied. After surgical exploration, 70 patients (86.4%) had testicular torsion. Patients with torsion had lower age (p < 0.0001), lower time from symptom to ED visit (p < 0.0001), sudden onset pain (p = 0.003), left side pain (p < 0.0001), and lower white blood cell (WBC) count (p = 0.001). The frequency of dysuria (p = 0.032), diarrhea/vomiting (p = 0.005), and fever (p = 0.002) was significantly lower in patients with torsion. The cremasteric reflex was absent in 57 (81.4%) cases who suffered from testicular torsion (p = 0.001). Based on the results of binary logistic regression analysis, age (B = -0.175, SE = 0.45; p < 0.0001) was the sole independent predictor of testicular torsion. The highest area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve in predicting the presence of torsion belonged to lower age [91.0 (95%CI: 83.2 - 98.7)], pain in left testis [0.931 (95%CI: 0.828-0.987)], and lower WBC count [0.805 (95%CI: 0.684-0.926)], respectively. It seems that clinical variables are not accurate enough to be considered as the sole predictor of testicular torsion and they should be used with caution and in combination with other available screening tools like Doppler ultrasonography in this regard."

The aim of this study is to investigate the protective and preventive effects of etomidate, an imidazole derivative, a non-barbiturate general anesthetic agent, without analgesic effect, on testicular ischemia-reperfusion injury. Twenty-four adult male Wistar rats weighing 200-250 g were used in the study. Torsion was created in all rats by rotating left testes 720° clockwise on the day of the experiment. 30 minutes before detorsion, 4 mg/kg etomidate and 10 mg/kg propofol were administered intraperitoneally to the etomidate and propofol groups, respectively. After an hour of ischemia, the left testis was reinstated, and the tissues were repaired according to their physiology. Following 24 hours of reperfusion, the animals were euthanized after ipsilateral and contralateral testes were removed. Etomidate applied before testicular detorsion significantly suppressed germ cell damage and Leydig cell loss in ipsilateral tissue. It did not cause any significant changes in the percentage of necrosis, histological score, and tubule rupture in ipsilateral tissue. Propofol administered before testicular detorsion significantly suppressed the percentage of necrosis only in the ipsilateral tissue. In addition, no signs of damage were observed in the contralateral testis. These findings show that etomidate administered before detortion creates a protective effect by preventing testicular ischemia-reperfusion injury."

It is reported to be present in about 2% of persons who present with non-palpable testicles. Most transverse testicular ectopia patients undergo orchiopexy in early childhood; however, in rare cases, they are diagnosed in adulthood upon detection of testicular tumors.A 40-year-old man visited our hospital complaining of right abdominal pain. His right testis was palpable in the right scrotum; however, the left scrotal compartment seemed empty and there was a painful mass on the upper part of the right scrotal compartment. Computed tomography showed that both spermatic cords traversed through the right inguinal canal, and transverse testicular ectopia was diagnosed. Ultrasonography showed absent left testicular circulation on the upper part of the right scrotum. Upon diagnosis of left testicular torsion, emergency surgery was conducted. In the right scrotum, there was a normal right testicle, and a necrotic left testicle which was twisted 180 degrees on its axis, towards the cranial side. Histopathology of the excised left testicle revealed an incidental seminoma, pT1. Tumor markers following surgery were negative, and there was no evidence of recurrence observed with two years and five months of follow-up.Non-palpable testicular torsion may also be a transverse testicular ectopia. Therefore, it is necessary to consider malignant tumors based on the patient's age."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion (TT) is the most common urological emergency in children and young adults that can lead to infertility in many cases. The ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury due to TT has been implicated in the pathogenesis of testicular damage. The main pathological mechanisms of contralateral injury after ipsilateral TT are not fully understood. In the presented study, we investigated the molecular and microscopic basis of ipsilateral and contralateral testicular injury following ipsilateral testicular torsion detorsion (T/D) and explored the possible protective role of vitamin D3. The biochemical analysis indicated that IR injury following T/D significantly decreased the activity of testicular glutathione peroxidase (GPx) enzyme, level of serum testosterone, serum inhibin B, and expression of testicular miRNA145, while increased the activity of testicular myeloperoxidase (MPO) enzyme, level of testicular malondialdehyde (MDA), level of serum antisperm-antibody (AsAb), and expression of ADAM-17. The histological and semen analysis revealed that torsion of the testis caused damages on different tissues in testis. Interestingly, administration of vitamin D3 prior to the IR injury reversed the deterioration effect of IR injury on the testicular tissues as indicated by biochemical and histological analysis which revealed normal appearance of the seminiferous tubules with an apparent decrease in collagen fiber deposition in both ipsilateral and contralateral testes. Our results revealed that the protective effect of vitamin D3 treatment could be attributed to target miRNA145 and ADAM17 protein. To further investigate these findings, we performed a detailed molecular modelling study in order to explore the binding affinity of vitamin D3 toward ADAM17 protein. Our results revealed that vitamin D3 has the ability to bind to the active site of ADAM17 protein via a set of hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions with high docking score. In conclusion, this study highlights the protective pharmacological application of vitamin D3 to ameliorate the damages of testicular T/D on the testicular tissues via targeting miRNA145 and ADAM17 protein."

A retrospective observational cohort study was carried out at two district general hospitals in the UK for boys aged ≤16 years presenting with acute scrotal pain between January 2014 and October 2017 managed by adult general surgery (AGS) at one hospital and adult urology (AU) at the other. Some 565 patients were eligible for inclusion (n=364 AGS, n=201 AU). A higher proportion of patients underwent surgical exploration at AGS compared with AU (277/346 (80.1%) vs 96/201 (47.8%); p<0.001). Of those who underwent exploration, 101/373 (27.1%) had TT, of whom 25/101 (24.8%) underwent orchidectomy and 125/373 (33.5%) had torted testicular appendage. There was no statistically significant difference in rates of orchidectomy between AGS (19/68, 27.9%) and AU (6/33, 18.2%) with testicular salvage rates of 72.1% and 81.8%, respectively (p=0.334). Patients were twice as likely to be readmitted at AGS as at AU (28/346 (8.1%) vs 8/201 (4.0%); p=0.073). Although intraoperative findings were similar between adult general surgeons and urologists, there were significant differences in surgical management, with a higher rate of surgical exploration by general surgeons. Testicular salvage and 30-day postoperative morbidity rates at both institutions were acceptable but the readmission rate was high at 6.6%. It is not known why there is a heterogeneity in management of acute scrotal pain between specialist centres, and further prospective investigations are warranted."

On the 7th day of the detorsion all left testes were fixed in Bouin solution and sent to Pathology Department for histopathological examination. All right testes were washed with normal saline, dried in a sterile way and stored in - 80 °C deepfreeze up to the date of biochemical processes. Testicular tissues were obtained for the detection of myeloperoxidase (MPO), malondialdehyde (MDA), AOPP (advanced oxidation protein product) for oxidant markers and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD),glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities for antioxidant markers and histopathological exploration. The effects of NaHs administration on oxidation were evaluated by determination of testicular MPO, MDA and AOPP levels. Increased testicular MPO (58.6%) activity was observed in the I/R group compared to the sham group. Following NaHS treatment, MPO (26.7%) activity was significantly decreased in rats exposed to I/R injury (Figure 1). MDA levels did not alter. Increases in AOPP (20.9%) levels were observed in the I/R group. NaHS treatment resulted in significant decreases in AOPP (25.1%) levels in testes tissues of rats exposed to I/R injury. The effects of NaHS treatment on antioxidant system FRAP, SOD, GSH and GSH-Px activities were evaluated. GSH levels were significantly increased in the IR + NaHS group compared to the I/R group. In histopathological examination degeneration of seminiferous tubules and spermatogenic cells were observed in the I/R group. After NaHS treatment, normal spermatogenic activity with many spermatozoa in the lumen of most seminiferous tubules were observed in the I/R injured rats. According to Johnsen's scoring (JS), the I/R group was significantly decreased compared to the sham group. JS values for the I/R + NaHS group were significantly increased compared to the I/R group. Our study supports that ischemia/reperfusion injury plays an important role in the testicular torsion injury, and it is a pioneer study showing that H₂S may have a potential for therapeutic effect. The limitation of this work is this is an experimental study with limited number of animals. According to the results of our study, hydrogen sulfide treatment has beneficial effects on biochemical and histopathological results of testicular injury in testic torsion."

    "abstract": "Spermatic cord torsion is a frequent urological emergency that mostly concerns teenagers and young adults. This study aimed to determine the clinical and surgical characteristics of young adults who had scrotal exploration for suspected spermatic cord torsion and to identify clinical risk factors associated with needless scrotal exploration. We retrospectively collected national data from patients aged 12years and older who underwent a surgical exploration for suspicion of torsion of the spermatic cord between 2005 and 2019 in 17 hospitals. We analyzed demographics, surgical and postoperative characteristics in our population. We compared the cohort according to the intraoperative diagnosis of torsion or not. In total, 2940 had surgical exploration: 1802 (61.3%) patients had torsion of the spermatic cord and 1138 (38.7%) had another diagnosis. In multivariate analysis, age (OR: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.01-1.06; P=0.005), medical history of cryptorchism (OR: 4.14; 95% CI: 1.05-16.31; P=0.042) and VAS pain score (OR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.83-0.98; P=0.018) were risk factors significantly associated with unnecessary surgical exploration. The rate of complications in the 90days after surgery was 11% in the \"torsion\" group, and 9.7% in the \"non-torsion\" group (P=0.28). Scrotal exploration without intraoperative diagnosis of torsion was performed in 40% of our cohort. VAS pain score and cryptorchism history can help for the diagnosis but scrotal exploration remains the way to diagnose spermatic cord torsion and should be performed on the slightest suspicion, even after 24hours of symptoms, as the chances for testicular salvage remains around 50%."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a serious emergency and a well-known cause of male infertility. It represents 10 %-15 % of scrotal diseases in children. Kisspeptin (KISS1) is a hormone secreted from the hypothalamic nuclei and testis, but its role in testis is not fully understood. Semaglutide is a novel antidiabetic glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analog. Hence, we designed the current study to elucidate the possible ameliorative effect of semaglutide on ischemia/reperfusion-induced testicular dysfunction in rats and highlight the role of the testicular GLP-1/PCG-1α-PPAR-α-KISS1 signaling pathway. We randomly divided 50 male Sprague Dawley into five equal groups (10 rats each): SHAM, exendin 9-39 -treated (EX), testicular torsion/detorsion (T/D), testicular torsion/detorsion and semaglutide-treated (SEM + T/D), and testicular torsion/detorsion, exendin, and semaglutide-treated (EX + SEM + T/D). We quantified serum follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, total testosterone, testicular oxidative stress markers, testicular gene expression of GLP-1/KISS1 pathway-related genes (KISS1, KISS1R, GLP-1, GLP-1R, PGC-1α, PPAR-α), steroidogenesis pathway-related genes (STAR, CYP11A1, CYP17A1, HSD17B3, CYP19A1), HO-1, Nrf-2, and testicular protein expression of HIF-1α, TNF-α, NF-κβ, Caspase-3, FAS, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and KISS1 through testicular histopathology and immunohistochemistry assays. Testicular torsion/detorsion markedly elevated proapoptotic, proinflammatory, and oxidative stress marker levels, noticeably downregulating the expression of GLP-1/KISS1 and steroidogenesis pathway-related proteins. Semaglutide administration significantly ameliorated all these deleterious effects. Nevertheless, injecting exendin, a GLP1-R antagonist, before semaglutide abolished all the documented improvements. We concluded that semaglutide ameliorated ischemia/reperfusion-induced testicular dysfunction by modulating the GLP-1/PGC-1α-PPAR-α/KISS1/steroidogenesis signaling pathway, improving testicular oxidative state, and suppressing testicular inflammation and apoptosis."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion (TT) is an emergency complication that leads to oxidative stress and adversely affects spermatogenesis. Although immediate treatment consists of testicular detorsion (TD) to reverse TT-induced ischemia, mechanisms underlying recovery have yet to be fully understood. The current study aimed to investigate TD effects after a one-hour experimental TT by evaluating testicular antioxidant status and apoptosis-related proteins. Forty male Wistar rats were submitted to TT by testicular rotation, for one hour. Following TT, 32 rats were submitted to TD for 1, 2, 4, and 8 h (N = 8/group), the other 8 rats euthanized as TT-only. For controls, 8 rats were sham-operated. Testicular tissues were aseptically dissected for biochemical, histopathological, and immunohistochemistry analyses. The TD groups, especially after 4 h of TD, exhibited diminished MDA and increased TAC and GPX levels in testicular tissue. Levels of p53 and Caspase-3 were down-regulated in T1D4 and T1D8 groups versus torsion group. Bcl-2 was increased in T1D4 and T1D8 groups compared to the TT group. Moreover, spermatogenesis was recovered in T1D4 and T1D8 groups compared to the TT group. It can be concluded that after 1 h TT in rats, at least 4 h post-TD is needed for testicular tissue to initiate recovery."

    "abstract": "Background: Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency that needs prompt diagnosis and treatment. Point-of-Care ultrasound (POCUS) can not only establish the diagnosis but also guide the Emergency Physician in evaluating the response to manual detorsion. Case Report: We describe the case of a 13-year-old male who presented with acute scrotal pain. We demonstrate how bedside ultrasound was used to make the diagnosis of testicular torsion, guide the technique for manual detorsion, and confirm adequate return of blood flow. Our case illustrates the ease with which POCUS can be used in real time to diagnose and treat organ-threatening pathology, but more importantly, it shows how real-time POCUS was used to detorse a testicle that was refractory to the standard detorsion technique. Conclusion: The acute scrotum is a time-sensitive presentation and if testicular torsion is present, the diagnosis should be made as soon as possible. Many Emergency Departments do not have 24-hour coverage of ultrasound technicians, which would delay the diagnosis and treatment. Moreover, when manual detorsion is attempted, it often does not work because the testicle may need more than the standard 180 degree medial to lateral rotation. POCUS provides real-time analysis of return of blood flow and can thus guide further rotation, or opposite direction rotation, as needed."

Reported herein is a case of traumatic testicular torsion which was managed as a straightforward blunt scrotal trauma in a private health facility. He eventually had an orchidectomy when he presented to us 4 months later on account of a marked reduction in testicular volume.

With these societal changes came a notable reduction in emergency department attendance. Our aim was to analyse emergency urological procedures performed during the COVID-19 era versus the previous year. A retrospective review of theatre logbooks was undertaken comparing numbers of emergency urological procedures performed between 1 March 2020 and 31 May 2020 (i.e. the COVID-19 era) with the corresponding 3-month period in 2019. A total of 173 cases were analysed between the two time periods. Similar overall numbers of cases were performed in 2019 (n = 90) and 2020 (n = 83). In particular, similar patient case numbers are also noted in both scrotal explorations (13 vs 9) and ureteric stone surgeries (69 vs 70). However, orchidectomies for testicular cancers were reduced by 63% (3/8). On further analysis of the scrotal exploration group, only 3 were performed in the period after lockdown regulations were instated. Whilst patients with ureteric colic continue to present, those with acute testis pain requiring exploration attended less frequently, raising the possibility of undiagnosed testicular torsion in the community."

    "title": "Evaluating Acute Testicular Pain Using Point-of-Care Hand-Held Doppler in the Emergency Department: A Prospective Pilot Study.",
    "abstract": "Introduction Testicular pain is one of the common conditions in patients visiting the emergency department. The causes of acute testicular pain vary from non-urgent inflammatory conditions like epididymo-orchitis to testicular torsion which is a surgical emergency. Early diagnosis of testicular torsion with early initiation of appropriate surgical intervention helps in salvaging the testes. There is a need for a simple, rapid bedside diagnostic tool for the evaluation and triaging of subjects with acute testicular pain in the emergency department. The aim of this study is to determine whether hand-held Doppler (HHD) examination by the emergency department (ED) physician can safely rule out testicular torsion in a case of acute testicular pain. Materials and Methods A prospective pilot study was conducted in the emergency department of Alkhor Hospital, Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar. The subjects between 18 to 50 years of age who presented to the ED with testicular pain were included. Subjects with recent trauma to the scrotum, or recent genitourinary surgery and those who had pain for more than 48 hours were excluded. Point-of-care HHD was done by a single ED physician who was blinded for the Doppler study results done by the radiologist. The results of the HHD performed by the ED physician and Doppler study performed by the radiologist were compared and analyzed. Results  Forty-five patients were included in the study. The mean age was 28 years and the mean duration of pain was 20 hours. HHD ruled out testicular torsion in 44 subjects with a specificity of 97.8%. In one subject, HHD was reported as torsion testis which was ruled out by the radiologist. The radiologist Doppler ruled out torsion in all 45 subjects. Conclusion The diagnostic performance of HHD by the ED physicians was almost equal to that of radiologists in ruling out testicular torsion. HHD can be used as a first-line triaging tool by the ED physician to rule out torsion of testis in patients presenting with acute testicular pain. We conclude that patients with testicular pain with a negative HHD for torsion testis can be safely discharged from the emergency department."

    "abstract": "Testicular appendage torsion (TAT) is a medical emergency that presents as an acute scrotum, usually in children and preadolescents. In previous reports of TAT, most cases have been treated conservatively, but some necessitate surgical treatment. Our aim was to examine the incidence, clinical examination findings, etiology, and treatment of TAT. We retrospectively reviewed records of all patients with TAT (aged ≤15 years) treated at the Juntendo University Urayasu Hospital between January 2012 and September 2020. Surgical treatment was performed when a diagnosis of testicular torsion could not be completely ruled out or if pain recurred after conservative treatment. Patients with a hard scrotum or scrotal erythema were hospitalized for conservative treatment. Data regarding age, diagnosis, blood test results, and clinical findings were analyzed. Among 101 boys with TAT, the median age was 10 years. The incidence of TAT varied significantly according to age and was highest among patients aged 8-11 years. Sixty-seven boys (66.3%) underwent inpatient surgical treatment, 10 boys (9.9%) received inpatient conservative treatment, and 24 boys (23.8%) received outpatient conservative treatment. The median duration of hospitalization was significantly shorter among those who underwent surgery (2.0 days) than among those who received inpatient conservative treatment group (3.5 days). Operations were short, uncomplicated, and safe; they shortened the hospital stay; and they would certainly prevent recurrence of TAT and testicular torsion on one side. Furthermore, we recommended that TAT patients presenting with signs of severe inflammation, such as hard scrotum or scrotal erythema, receive early surgical treatment to minimize duration of hospitalization."

    "abstract": "Acute scrotal pain is a common emergency presentation in paediatric surgery. Torsion of the testicular appendage (TTA) is the most common cause for pain, with testicular torsion (TT) being the sinister pathology to exclude. Outcomes are time dependent, and a delayed scrotal exploration could result in testicular loss. We performed a review on a large retrospective cohort of 449 surgical scrotal explorations at a large referral paediatric surgical centre over three years. Only about a quarter of children with testicular pain presented within 4 h. TT is commonly associated with nausea and an abnormal lie. Two children with a classical 'blue dot' sign were later found to have a testicular torsion. 19% of all children with a TTA were also seen to have Bell clapper anomaly (BCA). Recurrent testicular pain was associated with 84.7% (p < 0.001) of BCA. Intra-operative diagnosis of TTA correlated with histopathology in 84.6% (p=0.021). The sensitivity of intraoperative diagnosis was 90.9% with a specificity of 75.3%. Routine histopathology for a classic TTA may not be required especially in resource poor situations. All children presenting with recurrent episodes of testicular pain must be considered for surgical scrotal exploration. And in view of the incidence of BCA in this cohort, all scrotal explorations for acute scrotal pain should include an assessment for BCA."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion, the twisting of the testis or spermatic cord, places the testis at risk of vascular compromise and is a surgical emergency. Testicular torsion is predominantly unilateral (98% of torsion cases) and primarily affects neonates and adolescents in a bimodal distribution. Bilateral testicular torsion is exceedingly rare (2% of cases) and is associated with neonates. To the authors' best knowledge, there have been no reports of bilateral torsion in adult males over the age of 24. A 57-year-old man presented to the emergency department 9 days after developing testicular pain while lifting his lawnmower. Ultrasonography performed at an outside facility was unremarkable. He was encouraged to followup with urology as an outpatient. Despite outpatient analgesia, he continued to experience pain and returned to the ED, where repeat ultrasonography demonstrated bilateral torsion with hypoperfusion. Although testicular torsion is uncommon, the clinician must recognize torsion; if left untreated, torsion leads to infertility. Previous publications suggest that ultrasonographic findings of bilateral testicular torsion should be attributed to \"technical failure\" rather than a plausible diagnosis. However, this case demonstrates the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion, especially with an atypical age range and pathological presentation, particularly among men during their reproductive years."

All adult patients who underwent acute scrotal exploration for suspected torsion between 2007 and 2017 at Auckland City Hospital were included (n=316). Clinical notes were reviewed for demographic and clinical data. Admission-to-operation time was compared between patients who had a formal ultrasound and those who did not. Ultrasound was performed in 153/316 (48.4%) patients. Ultrasound sensitivity and specificity for torsion was 97.8% and 52.9% respectively. Median admission-to-operation time was 106 minutes for patients who did not have an ultrasound and 225 minutes for those who did (excluding those with missed torsion on ultrasound) (p=<0.0001). Non-viable testicle was identified intraoperatively in 11/163 patients (6.7%) who did not have an ultrasound, and in 42/122 (34.4%) of those who did (excluding those with missed torsion on ultrasound) (p=<0.0001). Ultrasound is a sensitive test for testicular torsion but associated with an average two-hour delay to theatre and a higher rate of intraoperative finding of non-viable testicle in this centre."

Therefore, a medical treatment to prevent this damage may be a rational idea. We aimed to evaluate the protective effect of oltipraz in testicular ischaemia/reperfusion damage. Twenty-eight Wistar-Albino rats were randomly divided into four groups. In ischaemia/reperfusion group, testicular torsion was executed, and orchiectomy was done 4 hr after detorsion with no treatment. Second group performed torsion; intraperitoneal 50 mg/kg oltipraz was applied 30 min before detorsion, and orchiectomy was performed 4 hr after detorsion. Third group applied torsion; intraperitoneal 150 mg/kg oltipraz was applied 30 min before detorsion, and orchiectomy was performed 4 hr after detorsion. Last one was the sham group. We evaluated tissue malondialdehyde (MDA), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH) and Johnsen testicular biopsy score. There was a significant decrease in TGF-β1, GSH and MDA values in oltipraz treatment groups compared with ischaemia/reperfusion group. Oltipraz treatment has significant protective effect in testicular ischaemia/reperfusion damage. However, more clinical studies are needed to demonstrate appropriate dose and its effects."

Data are presented as median (range) and compared using non-parametric tests. P < 0.05 was regarded as significant. A total of 560 paediatric scrotal explorations were performed. Of these, 25 (4%) were under one year at the time of surgery, median 4 months (1 day-5 months) (Fig. 1). The most common diagnosis was \"epididymitis\" (11/25, 44%). Testicular torsion was found in 28% (7/25), increasing to 66% (4/6) in those under one month. Of those with confirmed testicular torsion, three (43%) underwent a primary orchiectomy with contralateral fixation and three (43%) detorsion and bilateral fixation, with all three cases found to have testicular atrophy at follow-up. The final case was of metachronous torsion, with the initial presentation not operated on and the subsequent presentation undergoing detorsion and fixation. This was the only case of testicular salvage in our series. There were no underlying urological issues in any patient and no reported complications or ongoing urological issues post-surgery. The rate of follow-up was 17/25 (68%). We present one of the only clinical series to focus on acute scrotum in the under one year old and not just the neonatal period.

Using a rat model of testicular IR injury, the present study investigated the protective effects of relaxin (RLN) against oxidative stress, testicular dysfunction, inflammation, histological damage, arrested spermatogenesis, and germ cell apoptosis as well as explored the usefulness of RLN as a potential protective drug for IR injury combined with surgical treatment. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to left testicular ischemia for 2 h, followed by 24 h of reperfusion. They were subsequently divided into three groups: sham, IR, and IR + RLN groups. Porcine RLN (500 ng/h) or saline was infused using an implanted osmotic mini-pump 90 min after inducing ischemia. The RLN dose used herein was that which resulted in serum RLN levels comparable to those in mid-pregnant rats based on previous studies. Testicular IR increased germ cell apoptosis and histological damage as well as promoted disorganized and arrested spermatogenesis, accompanied by a significant increase in oxidative stress and inflammation. However, RLN administration ameliorated the adverse consequences associated with IR injury by attenuating oxidative stress and mitigating apoptosis and inflammation. The study findings clearly demonstrated that RLN exerts a protective effect against IR-induced testicular injury by attenuating oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation, suggesting that RLN together with surgical treatment is a potentially efficacious approach toward ameliorating testicular dysfunction following testicular torsion."

During the COVID-19 pandemic, pediatric patients with symptoms of testicular torsion may be reluctant to seek medical care which increases the likelihood of delayed presentation and the need for an orchiectomy. This observational study sought to determine whether there was a higher number of testicular torsion cases during COVID-19. As the first patient with COVID-19 was admitted to our facility on March 6, 2020, we identified male children ages 1-18 years with testicular torsion between March 1-December 31, 2020 (during COVID-19) compared to the same time period between 2015 and 2019 (prior to COVID-19). All patients were evaluated at our Institution's Emergency Department by a pediatric urologist. There were 38 cases of testicular torsion between March 1-December 31, 2020 compared to 15.8 cases on average during the same 10-month period between 2015 and 2019 (a total of 79 cases). There was a statistically significant increase in testicular torsion cases during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to equivalent time periods in 2015-2019 (38 vs. 15.8, p = 0.05). Patients with testicular torsion during the COVID-19 pandemic were younger, had a longer duration of symptoms, and had a higher number of orchiectomies (although not statistically significant). During the COVID-19 pandemic, an escalation in testicular torsion cases was observed. Timely assessment, diagnosis, and surgery are crucial to prevent testicular loss and potential infertility in the future. Further evaluation is needed to elucidate the surge in testicular torsion and possible mechanisms."

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION To examine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the presentation, management and outcome of testicular torsion at our institution. A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained testicular torsion database was performed. Patients ≤ 18 years of age evaluated in our emergency room between 3/11/2020 to 10/1/2020 (during-COVID-19) and the same period in 2018 and 2019 (pre-COVID-19) with US diagnosed and OR confirmed testicular torsion were included. Basic demographics, timing of presentation, referral rate, time to OR and orchiectomy rate were extracted and compared. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 82 torsions were included in the study; 55 pre-COVID-19 and 27 during-COVID-19. The incidence of testicular torsion remained the same; 3.93 cases/month pre-COVID-19 versus 3.86 cases/month during-COVID-19 (p = 0.791). However, there were significantly fewer delayed (> 24 hours) presentations (11.1% versus 45.5% , p = 0.003), shorter time from onset of symptoms to presentation (median 15.5 hours versus 8 hours, p = 0.001), and a lower but not statistically significant overall orchiectomy rate (33.3% versus 50.9% p = 0.1608) during-COVID-19. Among those presenting acutely with torsion (< 24 hours from onset), no statistical differences were found in the median time from US diagnosis to OR, from ED to OR, referral rate, or orchiectomy rate between the two groups. Lastly, SARS-CoV2 testing did not delay median time from ED to OR. There was a notably less delayed presentation of testicular torsion and shorter ischemia time on presentation during-COVID, however, no significant change of time to OR or orchiectomy rate in those with acute testicular torsion were observed."

    "title": "Access to emergency paediatric surgery for testicular torsion or intestinal volvulus in New Zealand: A system perspective.",
    "abstract": "The risk of organ loss is increased in children with testicular torsion or intestinal volvulus if surgical management is not expedient. The current retrospective study aims to review the time-course from first symptom to 'knife to skin' in these conditions, to determine where delays occur and facilitate a systems approach to better manage these children. One hundred consecutive paediatric cases of scrotal exploration for presumed testicular torsion, and 100 neonatal cases presenting with possible malrotation/volvulus were analysed to evaluate the exact time-course of events from admission to surgery. (i) Scrotal exploration: the median time from onset of symptoms to presentation was 12 h (interquartile range (IQR): 5-48 h). In children over 5 years of age, 36% (33/93) were transferred from an external district service area. (ii) Malrotation/volvulus: the median duration of symptoms prior to arrival/assessment was 12 h (IQR: 4-24 h). The median cumulative in-hospital time was over 6 h (368 min, IQR: 247-634 min). Time to presentation contributes significantly to testicular ischaemic time. This delay to timely surgical intervention is multi-factorial, and must be addressed at a public health level. Support and training in the management of testicular torsion should be provided to all adult surgeons/trainees that may care for these children. In general, this condition is best managed at the presenting hospital whenever appropriate expertise is available. Novel pathways that streamline care may improve efficiency at an institutional level. Addressing issues of access to specialised neonatal surgery is more vexed on account of the tyranny of distance, and the pre-requisite level of surgical expertise required."

    "abstract": "Ischemia-reperfusion injury is a urological emergency condition that could lead to necrosis, testicular damage subfertility, and infertility. The purpose of this study was to identify changes taking place in the rat testis at short-term (4 hr) as well as long-term (7 days) reperfusion following testicular torsion and to evaluate the effects of Proxeed Plus (PP), L-carnitine-rich antioxidant supplement, on preventing these changes using the biochemical parameters and histopathology. Thirty adult male rats were divided into five groups: in groups, 1-4 testicular ischemia was achieved by rotating the left testis 720° clockwise for 4 h and dividing into the sham, torsion/detorsion (T/D), T/D+1000 mg/kg BW PP, and T/D+5000 mg/kg BW PP groups, respectively. PP was administered intraperitoneally 30 min before detorsion while group 5 served as the normal control. All rats were sacrificed 4 h after detorsion. The same experimental design was set up, and animals were sacrificed after 7 days of detorsion. The testicular levels of human cyclooxygenase-2; tumor necrosis factor; interleukins-1β, 6, and 10; hydrogen peroxide; malonaldehyde; superoxide dismutase; catalase; glutathione transferase; glutathione peroxidase; glutathione reductase; and histopathological damage were evaluated. Our results revealed that rats in the torsion/detorsion group exhibited elevated testicular levels of oxidative markers and proinflammatory cytokines, low levels of antioxidant enzymes, and severe histological alterations relative to the control and sham groups. Treatments with 1000 and 5000 mg/kg BW of PP for 4 hr and 7 days significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the levels of the proinflammatory and oxidative markers while increasing the spermatogenesis, testicular levels of antioxidant enzymes, and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) in a dose-dependent manner. This suggested that PP exhibited anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities against I/R testes thus serving as an effective supplement to protect against testicular assault."

Detecting complications of pediatric illness in administrative data would facilitate widespread quality measurement, however the accuracy of such detection is unclear. We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients visiting a large pediatric emergency department. We analyzed those <22 years old from 2012 to 2019 with 1 of 14 serious conditions: appendicitis, bacterial meningitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), empyema, encephalitis, intussusception, mastoiditis, myocarditis, orbital cellulitis, ovarian torsion, sepsis, septic arthritis, stroke, and testicular torsion. We applied a method using disposition, diagnosis codes, and procedure codes to identify complications. The automated determination was compared with the criterion standard of manual health record review by using positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs). Interrater reliability of manual reviews used a κ. We analyzed 1534 encounters. PPVs and NPVs for complications were >80% for 8 of 14 conditions: appendicitis, bacterial meningitis, intussusception, mastoiditis, myocarditis, orbital cellulitis, sepsis, and testicular torsion. Lower PPVs for complications were observed for DKA (57%), empyema (53%), encephalitis (78%), ovarian torsion (21%), and septic arthritis (64%). A lower NPV was observed in stroke (68%). The κ between reviewers was 0.88. An automated method to measure complications by using administrative data can detect complications in appendicitis, bacterial meningitis, intussusception, mastoiditis, myocarditis, orbital cellulitis, sepsis, and testicular torsion. For DKA, empyema, encephalitis, ovarian torsion, septic arthritis, and stroke, the tool may be used to screen for complicated cases that may subsequently undergo manual review."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a urologic emergency induced by torsion of the spermatic cord, interrupting blood circulation to the testis. Therapeutic options for testicular torsion, except surgical restoration of testis, are rarely applied in clinical practice. This study, therefore, investigated whether topical application of nitrite (NO2 -) is beneficial in tissue damage due to testicular ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats. Pubertal Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to seven groups: group A, sham-operated control group; group B, I/R with no treatment; groups C, D, and E, I/R followed by treatment with three different doses of nitrite; group F, I/R followed by administration of nitrite and a NO scavenger, C-PTIO (2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide potassium salt); and group G, I/R followed by administration of nitrate (NO3 -). Unilateral testicular ischemia was maintained for 5 h, followed by reperfusion for 24 h. Nitrite and nitrate were topically administered before reperfusion. Compared to group A, germ cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, antioxidant enzymatic function, and lipid peroxidation were significantly increased, along with abnormal morphology and impaired spermatogenesis in group B (P < 0.05). In contrast, testicular damage was generally attenuated in the nitrite treatment groups due to a reduction in superoxide and peroxynitrite levels and the inhibition of caspase-3-dependent apoptosis (P < 0.05 vs. group B). These therapeutic effects of nitrite-derived NO were suppressed after injection of C-PTIO, which showed in group F. Taken together, our results demonstrate that topical application of nitrite may be one of the therapeutic strategies for testicular ischemia-reperfusion injury."

    "abstract": "Scrotal exploration is a frequently performed emergency procedure in children. It is a subject of debate as to whether and how a non-torted testis should be fixed, with a wide variation in practice across the UK. This study aims to ascertain whether the method of testicular fixation (if any) impacts on patient outcomes. A review of all emergency scrotal explorations performed in children under the age of 18 between 2008 and 2018 in a tertiary Paediatric Surgery unit was undertaken. Patients were categorised by initial fixation method, chi squared analysis was used to compare complication and reoperation rates. 522 boys were taken to theatre, 424 had a unilateral procedure and 98 had bilateral; after 35 orchidectomies, 585 testes were left in situ. The most frequent diagnosis at operation was torted testicular appendage (n = 278, 53%), followed by testicular torsion (n = 79, 15%). The number of testes by category of fixation were: 72 no documented fixation, 130 dartos pouch only, 34 absorbable sutures, 346 non-absorbable sutures and 3 unspecified sutures. There was no difference in the reattendance rate between groups after outliers were removed (p = 0.72). Thirty-seven patients experienced complications, most commonly ongoing pain. Nine patients required an ipsilateral reoperation, 25 underwent a contralateral operation at a later date. The complication rate appeared to be higher in the no fixation group compared to the dartos (p = 0.02) and sutured groups (p = 0.048). Testes in the no fixation group had a higher reoperation rate compared to the sutured group (p = 0.002). The present study is a detailed analysis of a wide variety of emergency testicular fixation methods in a large cohort, including the routine fixation of non-torted testes. Whilst there appears to be a benefit to using sutured or dartos fixation, this merits cautious interpretation. It is likely that influences on complications and reoperations are multifactorial and cannot be attributed solely to the method of testicular fixation. Adoption of a standardised approach to emergency fixation of testes within or across institutions may be a potential avenue for future studies."

The first consultation was at the hospital in 75.1% of cases, but an ultrasound was performed only in 7.5%. When TT diagnosis was performed, 97.3% had undergone ancillary tests. The MPL was significantly associated with non-criminal proceedings and with less than 6 h of symptoms' evolution, and, within this subgroup, without undergoing an ultrasound scan. Late consultations, wrong diagnosis and late diagnosis are claimed. When MPL are claimed by means of non-criminal law, the existence of responsibility is frequently considered, even more in those cases when the consultation took place before 6 h of evolution with no ancillary tests having been performed."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency. Early diagnosis and surgical treatment are vital in order to preserve the affected gonad. Current surgical teaching emphasizes sudden, severe, persistent, unilateral scrotal pain as a cardinal symptom of testicular torsion. We present the case of unilateral testicular torsion in a 14-year-old patient who presented with the absence of severe pain. Despite a delayed presentation to the emergency department, the gonad could be salvaged successfully. Literature on the topic of testicular torsion presenting with minimal pain is limited. Nevertheless, pediatric surgeons might be faced with cases similar to the one we describe. Underestimating this phenomenon might lead to a delay of treatment. In such cases, ultrasound can be a beneficial addition in the diagnosis and accelerate definitive operative treatment. The presented case clearly demonstrates that, although we do not include testicular torsion without severe pain in our surgical teaching algorithms, we might encounter it in our clinical practice."

There are multiple causes of acute scrotum with testicular torsion being the most feared as delayed treatment leads to testicular loss. However, differentiating between epididymo-orchitis and torsion can be very difficult. We present a case of an 18-year old male patient with 2 separate episodes of acute scrotum. He had epididymo-orchitis as the first presentation followed by testicular torsion 5 days later. To our knowledge this is the first case of testicular torsion secondary to epididymo-orchitis. Differentiating between epididymo-orchitis and torsion is challenging but important due to risk of loss of testis with a wrong diagnosis. Once you establish epididymo-orchitis the suspicion for subsequent torsion should be high with close follow up and adequate counselling. He ultimately had orchiectomy, although a rare presentation, enlarged testis due to epididymo-orchitis can predispose an individual to developing testicular torsion thus adequate counselling on warning signs to patients with epididymo-orchitis is of particular importance so as to intervene early and ultimately save the testis."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a urologic emergency that requires surgical intervention. Its diagnosis is rarely made in elderly men especially the subset of men on urethral catheter. As a result, delayed diagnosis and surgical exploration occur leading to testicular infarction with necrosis, abscess formation and ultimately orchidectomy. We report a 73-year-old urologic patient referred with a 2-month history of transurethral catheterization to relieve retention of urine with subsequent scrotal pains and fever. Physical examination showed left hemi-scrotal swelling and normal right hemi-scrotal findings. A Doppler scan done showed an intratesticular fluid collection with no blood flow in the left testes. This case illustrates the need to include testicular torsion when diagnosing geriatric men with transurethral catheter presenting with any acute scrotal pains. We, therefore, recommend a detailed history and physical examination in addition to a colour Doppler ultrasound scan in making a diagnosis."

Testicular loss from missed diagnosis and delayed referral is preventable, especially when patients present early to first contact health care workers. This makes having the correct diagnostic knowledge for testicular torsion by these first contact healthcare providers a very essential determinant of its overall outcome. Two cases of testicular torsion are presented here. Their diagnoses were missed and referrals were delayed despite presenting within three hours of onset of symptoms. It led to the removal of the affected testis in both patients. This case series emphasizes the need to regard every testicular pain in children and young adults as testicular torsion until proven otherwise and highlights the importance of training the first contact health care providers on recognition and prompt intervention or referral of patients with testicular torsion."

During the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, an increased avoidance of the emergency departments for non-COVID-19 illnesses has been reported in the medical literature. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic caused increased number of orchiectomies in pediatric patients presenting with acute testicular torsion compared to pre-COVID-19 period. A total number of 119 pediatric patients who underwent surgery for acute testicular torsion from January 2019 to December 2020 were enrolled in retrospective multi-center study from six institutions in Croatia. The patients were divided in two groups. The first group (pre-COVID-19) consisted of the patients who underwent surgery before COVID-19 pandemic (n = 68), while the second group (COVID-19) consisted of the patients who underwent surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 51). Main outcomes of the study were orchiectomy rates and time from onset of the symptoms to emergency department presentation. During the COVID-19 pandemic period 43.1% (22/51) of the patients underwent orchiectomy while orchiectomy was performed in 16.2% (11/68) of the patients from the pre-COVID group (p = 0.001). Median time from onset of the symptoms to emergency department presentation during COVID-19 pandemic and pre-COVID-19 periods was 14h (IQR 5, 48) and 6h (IQR 3, 22) (p = 0.007), respectively. A higher proportion of patients waited over 24 h to present to emergency department during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-COVID-19 period (47% vs 8.8%, p = 0.007). During COVID-19 pandemic a significantly higher rates of orchiectomies and increase in delayed presentations for testicular torsion was found.

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a common urologic emergency and one of the causes of infertility in males. Hence, prompt diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent testicular damages. It has been reported that memantine, a drug for Alzheimer's disease has anti-oxidative role against cerebral ischemic stroke and cardiac ischemia reperfusion. In this experimental study, the effects of memantine on a testicular torsion injury in adolescent rat testis after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) were evaluated. Thirty-six adolescent rats were divided into three groups with 12 rats per group including sham-operated, T/D (torsion/detorsion) + vehicle, and T/D + memantine (10 mg/kg). Testicular torsion was induced for 2 h by rotating right testis 7200 in the clockwise direction. In treated group 30 min before detorsion, a single intraperitoneal dose of memantine was administered. After 4 h of reperfusion, orchiectomy was conducted and Histopathological and biochemical evaluations of testicular tissue samples were performed. The malondialdehyde level in the T/D group was significantly greater than in the sham operated group. Moreover, the testicular malondialdehyde values in the T/D + memantine group were significantly lower than in the T/D group. Also, significant decreases occurred in catalase and superoxide dismutase activities in the T/D group compared with sham operated group. These values were significantly greater in the memantine group than in the T/D group. Furthermore, after induction of T/D, histopathological evaluations also revealed severe testicular damages which were improved by memantine administration. Memantine prevented increases in oxidative stress markers and reductions of antioxidants during I/R injury in the current study. Subsequently the histologic injury was reduced in rats treated with memantine. The antioxidant characteristics of memantine and its protective effects have been shown in our study. These results suggest that administration of memantine before detorsion prevents I/R cellular damage in testicular torsion. This drug probably acts through reduction of reactive oxygen species and support antioxidant enzyme systems."

To assess the protective effect of dexpanthenol administered intratesticular after detorsion against testis I/R injury. Twenty-seven rats were randomly divided into 3 groups containing 9 rats each. The 1st group comprised the sham group with no procedure performed. The 2nd group had only torsion applied, while the 3rd group had torsion + dexpanthenol applied. Rats had 720° clockwise rotation applied to the left testis. After 2 h of ischaemia, testes were de-torsioned and the dexpanthenol group had 500 mg/kg dexpanthenol administered intratesticular after detorsion. After 4 h of reperfusion, rats had blood samples taken and orchiectomy was performed for histologic assessment. A significant difference was detected in all parameters [necrosis(p:<0.001), Cosentino grade (p < 0.001), congestion (p:0.005), fibrosis (p:<0.001), interstitial oedema (p:0.017), JTBS score (p:<0.001), apoptosis (p < 0.001) and testosterone levels (p:0.006)] when the sham, torsion, and torsion + dexpanthenol groups were compared. Significant differences were observed for fibrosis (p:0.010), Cosentino score (p < 0.001), JTBS score (p:<0.001), apoptosis (p:0.001) and total testosterone levels (p:0.013) when torsion and torsion + dexpanthenol groups were compared. The torsion + dexpanthenol group was identified to have more preservation of testis function observed histologically and hormonally compared to the torsion group. Dexpanthenol is used in many areas due to both epithelizing and antioxidant effects and lack of clear side effects. In spite of use of many chemical and biological agents to protect against testis I/R injury, none have entered routine use. This study showed that dexpanthenol, which can be easily injected intratesticular during detorsion surgery, has protective effect against histological and functional injury that may develop linked to testis I/R injury. The main limitations of the study are short duration of follow-up due to being a rat experiment and lack of comparison of lipid peroxidation products. This study identified that dexpanthenol with clinically easy use by intratesticular injection after detorsion during surgery had a protective effect against histological and functional injury that will develop linked to I/R injury in the testis."

    "abstract": "Scrotal and testicular conditions include benign masses, infections, testicular torsion, and testicular cancer. Common palpable benign scrotal masses include spermatocele, varicocele, and hydrocele. Most patients with these masses require no treatment. Some varicoceles are associated with impaired fertility, probably due to an increase in scrotal temperature that leads to testicular hyperthermia, oxidative stress, and reduced spermatogenesis. Patients with documented infertility or scrotal pain should be referred to a urology subspecialist for consideration of surgical management. Epididymitis and epididymo-orchitis are caused by infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, or enteric bacteria. Antibiotics and supportive measures (eg, scrotal elevation, bed rest) are recommended for management of acute epididymitis. Testicular torsion is a urologic emergency that requires rapid surgical exploration and orchidopexy to reduce the risk of testicular loss due to ischemia. Salvage rates exceed 90% when surgical exploration is performed within 6 hours of symptom onset. Testicular cancer commonly manifests as a painless, incidentally discovered mass in a single testis. Ultrasonography is recommended to confirm the diagnosis. The recommended primary intervention for a suspected malignant testicular tumor is radical inguinal orchiectomy."

Inclusion criteria were patients two months to 18 years of age with acute testicular torsion from March through July 2020. The retrospective group included patients from January 2019 through February 2020. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis tests, Chi-square tests, and logistic regression.

Mean age of groups were 19.27±6.93, 26.27±6.23 and 23.24±8.49 years, respectively. Statistical significance was found in epididymorchitis and testicular torsion groups compared to the control group according to NLR (P<0.01). PLR showed a statistically significant relationship only with the epididymorchitis group and control group (P=0.46). However, according to MPV values, no statistically significance was found between the groups.

Twenty-four urology (n = 12) and emergency medicine (n = 12) residents participated in the curriculum. After hands-on practice, 23 participants (96%) were deemed competent at scrotal POCUS. Pre-post testing showed significant improvement in knowledge (mean score 63% v. 80%, p < 0.001), comfort (mean Likert score 0.6 v. 3.6, p < 0.001) and confidence (mean Likert score 1.0 v. 2.1, p < 0.001) after the intervention. These effects were maintained at the 3-month assessment. The scrotal POCUS curriculum was effective and acceptable to both urology and emergency medicine residents. The findings suggest that scrotal POCUS can be learned effectively through a short hands-on session and didactic instruction. Le diagnostic rapide d’une torsion testiculaire à l’aide d’une échographie Doppler est souvent crucial à la prise en charge de ce trouble. Or, comme l’accès à cet examen peut être limité, l’échographie portable constitue une solution de rechange rapide et largement accessible. La présente étude visait la mise au point et l’évaluation d’un programme de formation sur l’échographie portable scrotale destiné aux résidents en urologie et en médecine d’urgence. Des experts en urologie, en médecine d’urgence et en imagerie diagnostique se sont servis d’une méthode Delphi modifiée pour concevoir un programme de formation sur l’échographie portable visant à faciliter le diagnostic de la torsion testiculaire. Ce programme comprenait 3 modules d’apprentissage vidéo en ligne, ainsi qu’une séance pratique d’une heure auprès de patients adultes normalisés. Nous avons évalué les compétences des participants en matière d’échographie portable scrotale au moyen d’une échelle validée. Nous avons également évalué les connaissances, l’aisance et le niveau de confiance des participants à l’égard de cet examen avant et immédiatement après la formation, puis 3 mois plus tard. Au total, 24 résidents en urologie (n = 12) et en médecine d’urgence (n = 12) ont suivi le programme de formation. Après la séance pratique, 23 participants (96 %) avaient les compétences nécessaires à la réalisation d’une échographie portable scrotale. La comparaison des résultats obtenus avant et immédiatement après la formation a montré une augmentation significative des connaissances (note moyenne : 63 % c. 80 %; p < 0,001), de l’aisance (moyenne à l’échelle de Likert : 0,6 c. 3,6; p < 0,001) et du niveau de confiance (moyenne à l’échelle de Likert : 1,0 c. 2,1; p < 0,001) des participants. Les effets de la formation étaient toujours présents 3 mois plus tard. Le programme de formation sur l’échographie portable scrotale s’est avéré efficace et acceptable pour les résidents en urologie et en médecine d’urgence. Les résultats obtenus laissent croire qu’une formation pédagogique et une courte séance d’apprentissage pratique permettent l’enseignement efficace de l’échographie portable scrotale."

    "abstract": "Urological emergencies constitute a significant part of emergency presentations in various referral centers. Data on the prevalence of these emergencies in West African sub-region are sparse. The study is aimed at determining the pattern of urological emergencies in our center and is geared towards bridging the gap in knowledge of the epidemiology of urological emergencies in this sub-region as a means of achieving efficient use of scarce resources. It was a retrospective study of all urological emergency cases that presented over six years in a Federal University Teaching Hospital in Nigeria. Data were collected from emergency register and theatre logs. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 25. A total of 267 patients presented with urological emergencies during the period of study with 258 (96.6%) men and 9 (3.4%) women. The mean age of the patients was 50.6 ± 20.8 years. Urinary retention was the most common urological emergency accounting for 159 (59.6%) cases followed by Fournier's gangrene 23 (8.6%) and testicular torsion 23 (8.6%). Bladder and ureteral injuries accounted for 5 (55.6%) of the urological emergency presentations in women while both injuries accounted for only 4 (1.6%) in men (P = 0.000). Urethral catheterization was the most commonly performed procedure 139 (52.1%), followed by percutaneous suprapubic cystostomy (SPC) 31 (11.6%). Urological emergencies have varying presentations in both sexes. Urinary retention, and acute scrotum were the most common urological emergencies in our facility. This knowledge can be used in emergency preparedness planning which involves personnel training and resource allocation."

This study aimed to evaluate the spectrum of Urologic emergencies and interventions offered in a tertiary hospital in Nigeria. We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients who were managed in our institution for emergency urologic conditions over a period of 6 years (2011-2017). The data extracted included; the demographic information, diagnosis and the treatment offered. The data obtained were analyzed using SPSS version 20. Data were displayed using mean +/- standard deviation and percentages. The records of a total of 681 patients were retrieved and they span across almost all ages with age range or 2-90 years. Urinary retention was the commonest emergency seen, accounting for 51.7% of the patients. Testicular torsion was the next most common (10%), others are bilateral ureteric obstruction and priapism with 5.4% and 5.3% respectively. Suprapubic cystostomy (SPC) was the commonest operative procedure performed (37.6%). The age range for patients with urinary retention was 3-90 years, though the peak incidence was in the 7th decade (37.3%). Patients with testicular torsion were young adults between the ages of 11 and 44 years. Urinary retention was the commonest urologic emergency followed by testicular torsion. Though urethral catheterization was successful in most patients urinary retention, making it the commonest procedure. SPC was the commonest emergency operative procedure performed.

    "abstract": "Use of Doppler ultrasonography (DUS) for patients with suspected testicular torsion (TT) is highly controversial and remains debated, as it can delay surgery and its performance may vary. To assess the role, impact, safety, and performance of DUS in the management of patients with suspected TT before scrotal exploration. The TORSAFUF cohort retrospectively included patients older than 12 yr who underwent surgery for suspected TT in 14 academic hospitals between 2005 and 2019. Perioperative data and surgical and DUS reports were collected. Clinical factors influencing DUS utilisation were analysed using multivariate logistic regression. The orchidectomy rate and delay to surgery were compared by group with and without DUS receipt using one-to-one propensity score (PS) matching to assess imaging safety. For the group with preoperative imaging, DUS performance was evaluated using a contingency table. Overall, 2922 patients were included, of whom 956 (32.7%) underwent DUS before surgery. DUS was more likely to be performed in older patients (odds ratio [OR] 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-1.2), those who experienced progressive onset of pain (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2), and patients who presented at the emergency department more than 6 h after their first scrotal symptoms (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.9-2.8). After PS matching, DUS receipt was not significantly associated with orchidectomy but the delay to surgery was 1 h longer. DUS demonstrated strong sensitivity of 85.2% (95% CI 82.1-88.3%) and specificity of 52.7% (95% CI 48.8-56.6%). The performance was better for younger patients and for those with time since onset of pain of >6 h. In this large retrospective study, DUS before surgery was safe, feasible, and useful in selected cases with suspected TT, but it should not delay or replace surgery in cases with a strong clinical suspicion. We analysed the performance and safety of an ultrasound scan of the scrotum before surgery for patients with a suspected twisted testicle (TT). This scan before surgery was not associated with a higher risk of negative outcomes but was only moderate in accurately diagnosing TT. Surgery to correct TT should not be delayed."

    "abstract": "By examining patients with testicular torsion (TT) that caused problems in medicolegal terms, the present study aims to define markers causing medical neglect or malpractice in similar conditions and perform a retrospective examination to characterize the medical aspects of patients with TT. In this study, 53 patients who underwent orchiectomy for TT following interventions made between 2004 and 2019 in different hospitals of Turkey and had satisfactory clinical findings in their files based on medicolegal inspections were included. The median age of the patients was nine years. Twenty-three (43.4%) of the patients had TT on the left side, 29 (54.7%) had TT on the right side, and one (1,9%) patient had bilateral TT. It was noticed that 31 (58.5%) patients had epididymo-orchitis (EO), seven patients had (13.2%) urinary infection, five (9.4%) patients had a hydrocele, and four (7.5%) patients had renal colic, and the others had testicle contusion, gastroenteritis, inguinal hernia, and acute appendicitis as misdiagnoses. The mean time that passed between admission and TT diagnosis was detected as 59±11.2 hours. A statistically significant relation was detected between the branch of the physician who first evaluated the patients and the presence of performing scrotal examination and imaging during admission. The ratio of physical scrotal examinations by emergency service physicians was lower than with the urologists. Among the preliminary examiner allowed to be an advanced evaluation for the possibility of missing diagnosis by an independent specialist physicians, 25 (47.2%) were urologists, 22 (41.5%) were emergency service physicians, four (7.5%) were pediatricians, and two (3.8%) were radiologists. Physicians should perform the required evaluations for a suitable diagnosis and treatment by putting aside their medicolegal concerns and prevent the problems by giving priority to patient health. For the correct diagnosis and proper management of TT, it is necessary to increase the information levels of physicians, and patients should be explored urgently in the event of any clinical suspicion."

We present the case of a 4-month-old male that presented to our community ED with scrotal swelling and vomiting of 16-hours duration. He was diagnosed with a functional testicular torsion from an incarcerated inguinal hernia, transferred to a hospital with pediatric urological capabilities and was taken to the operating room ~2 hours later. His hospital course was unremarkable, and he was discharged on day 3, having made a full recovery without any loss of bowel or testicle. There have only been a handful of cases in the literature of a pediatric patient presenting with a functional testicular torsion as a result of spermatic cord compression from an indirect inguinal hernia, with no reported cases of complete salvage at nearly 18 hours since symptom onset."

In this study we analysed the results of patients undergoing surgical exploration for acute scrotum. A multicentric retrospective clinical evaluation was carried out on patients who underwent urgent scrotal exploration at 12 different departments in North-Eastern Italy. Data included complete anagraphic information, clinical presentation, numeric pain rating scale, previous testicular surgery, Doppler serial ultrasonography (US) evaluation and concordance with surgical findings, testicular mobility, surgical treatment, staged or concurrent treatment of the contralateral gonad. Statistical analysis was conducted both for descriptive and inferential statistics with SPSS v26. Three hundred and sixty-eight cases were collected between January 2010 and June 2019. The time between symptom onset and ER access time was within 6 h in majority of patients. However, 17.4% of subject presented after more than 12 h. In patients undergoing US, this showed signs of ischemia in 237 patients (77.2%) and normal vascularisation in 70 (22.8%) of whom 26 had signs of testicular torsion at surgical exploration. Overall, the US data were concordant with the surgical findings in 254 cases (82.7%). A significant association was found between time-to-evaluation and time-to-treatment and the need for orchiectomy (p < 0.01). Testicular torsion management is still challenging in terms of time-saving decision making. Scrotal US is helpful, but even in the contemporary its sensitivity is low era in a non-neglectable number of cases, therefore surgical exploration is warranted in acute scrotum when torsion cannot be ruled out, even when US shows vascularisation."

Testicular diameters at preoperative period and 8th postoperative week were measured. Biochemically, MPO, NO, 3-NT and 4-HNE in testicular tissue and serum levels of NO, PGF 2α, 3-NT, 8-OHdG and 4-HNE were studied. Histopathologic examination and TUNEL assay were also performed. Biochemical and macroscopical parameters of both T/D + H30 and T/D + H90 groups were statistically different from group T/D with respect to protective effects of hypothermia. Johnsen's score was also statistically different in group T/D + H90. Hypothermia can easily be applied with ice bags both in perioperative period. This is the first study evaluating the effect of hypothermia applied postoperatively. Tissue level of protein oxidation marker (3-NT) and serum levels of DNA damage (8-OHdG), lipid peroxidation (4-HNE), protein oxidation (3-NT) and oxidative stress (PGF-2α) markers were measured for the first time. Hypothermia has been shown to be macroscopically, biochemically and histopathologically beneficial in the long-term experimental testicular torsion model."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is an emergent condition requiring prompt treatment. Previous studies have suggested transfer of pediatric testicular torsion cases may be detrimental to patient outcomes. Findings have not reached statistical significance. No study has quantitatively analyzed all literature reporting outcomes for transferred torsion patients. The aim of this study was to elucidate the impact of hospital transfer on pediatric testicular torsion outcomes through a systematic review and meta-analysis. A predefined study protocol registered with PROSPERO was developed according to PRISMA. A comprehensive literature review of articles investigating outcomes for pediatric testicular torsion for transferred and non-transferred (treated \"directly\" at presentation institution) patients with orchiectomy as the primary outcome was conducted by systematically searching PubMed and Embase. Potential studies were screened against a predefined study protocol. Meta-analysis using a random effects model with transferred status as the \"intervention\" was performed using Review Manager 5.3. Of 18 eligible studies, 9 retrospective studies comprised of 2564 patients (532 transferred and 2032 direct) were suitable for quantitative analysis. Main analysis showed transfer status does not have a significant effect on torsion outcomes (RR 0.96 [95% CI 0.78-1.17]; I2 = 44%). Subgroup analysis for torsion patients presenting within 24 h of symptom onset shows patients who are transferred to another facility for management are more likely to undergo orchiectomy than those treated at their presenting institution (RR 0.35 [95% CI 0.24-0.51]; I2 = 4%). In this meta-analysis, hospital transfer does not affect orchiectomy rate in pediatric patients with testicular torsion when pooling data from all presentation timeframes. Subgroup analysis of patients presenting with testicular torsion in an acute setting (<24 h of symptom onset) suggests the delay associated with hospital transfer has a deleterious effect on testicular viability."

    "abstract": "Torsion of the testis is an urgent surgical condition that endangers the viability of the gonad and the fertility of the patient. Our aim was to assess potential autoimmune processes and hormonal abnormalities in boys operated on due to that illness. The authors evaluated the levels of antibodies against sperm and Leydig cells, concentrations of follicle-stimulating, luteinizing and anti-Müllerian hormone, testosterone, oestradiol and vascular endothelial growth factor in the serum in 28 boys operated on due to torsion of the testis. Patients' sexual maturity was assessed according the Tanner scale (group G1, G4 and G5). No antibodies against sperm or Leydig cells were found in the serum. Statistically significant differences in follicle-stimulating and anti-Müllerian hormone concentrations were observed in the G1, and they were higher in the study than in the control group. There were no statistically significant differences in luteinizing hormone, testosterone, oestradiol and vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations in the study group or control group. Testosterone concentration was unrelated to total testicular volume. Results did not confirm the autoimmune process in boys with torsion of the testis. The pituitary-testis axis seems to have sufficient compensation capabilities. However, study results suggest that primary gonadal dysfunction may predispose to torsion. Significant differences exist between the literature data and own results on the formation of antibodies and hormonal changes due to testicular torsion in boys. It is a novel, prospective study on antibodies against sperms and Leydig cells in the serum and on hormonal processes occurring as a result of the testicular torsion from the prenatal period to the adolescence with division into pubertal groups. The study has revealed sufficient compensation capabilities of the pituitary-testis axis and no autoimmune process in boys with torsion of the testis."

A retrospective review of 116 patients who underwent exploration for testicular torsion between 2000 and 2015. Patients were divided into orchiectomy and salvaged testicle groups. Times in patient management and clinical features were compared with Mann-Whitney, chi-squared, and Fisher exact tests. Multivariate logistical regression was used to identify independent factors associated with orchiectomy. The median prehospital time of 48 h (15.4-138 h) in the orchiectomy group was longer than the 2.4 h (1.6 h-5.2h) in the salvaged group. Patients examined by a general practitioner (GP) prior to presenting at hospital had a median prehospital time of 48 h, compared to 3 h for patients not examined before presentation at hospital. In-hospital times between admission and operation room, as well as times between ultrasonography and operation room, were also longer in the orchiectomy group. Previous GP consultation (OR = 27.26, 95% CI 2.32-320.59, p = .009), prehospital time (OR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07, p = .003) and nausea (OR = 9.25, 95% IC 1.33-64.52, p = .025) were independent predictive factors associated with orchiectomy. Prehospital time was a determining factor in orchiectomy. For each extra hour of prehospital delay, the risk of orchiectomy increased by 4%. The rate of orchiectomy was higher among patients who first consulted a GP."

    "abstract": "Introduction and Background: Silver-Russell syndrome is a rare genetic disorder, occurring in ∼1/50,000 to 1/100,000 births. Anomalies of the urogenital tract such as hypospadias and cryptorchidism can be present. Testicular torsion is a urologic emergency that is most common in prepubertal boys. In patients with cryptorchidism, it can present with abdominal pain and nonspecific symptoms and can mimic other intra-abdominal emergency conditions. Case presentation: A 21-year-old man presented in emergency room at our hospital with acute right lower abdominal pain. Abdominal ultrasonography excluded acute appendicitis, atypical mass on the right side of the bladder was identified. Later, he reported history of inguinal exploration caused by undescended right testis in infancy where testis was not found, and Silver-Russell syndrome. Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan revealed an atypical mass on the right side of the bladder, suspicious for torsion of undescended testis, or tumor. Tumor markers for testicular cancer were negative. The patient underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic orchidectomy for torsion of undescended intra-abdominal testis. Histopathologic examination excluded malignancy. Conclusion: Testicular torsion should be considered as the cause of acute abdominal pain in patients with undescended testis and rare genetic disorders. Robot-assisted laparoscopic surgical exploration has the advantage of better exposure and visibility and should be considered in such cases."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is an acute urological emergency condition that occurs due to obstruction of blood flow to the testicles which may result in ischemia and loss of testicular functions. This study examined the protective effects of Proxeed Plus (PP), a dietary supplement on testicular ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injured rats using oxidative stress markers, hormonal levels, apoptotic parameters, histological and immunohistochemistry analysis at 4 h and after 7 days of reperfusion. The protective treatment of the I/R injured rats with PP at 1000 and 5000 mg/kg body weight (bw) resulted in significant increases in the serum and tissue antioxidative defense capacities (superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione, catalase, glutathione-s-transferase, and glutathione peroxidase), sex hormones (luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and testosterone), also reduce pro-oxidative markers (malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide), serum iNOS and apoptotic parameters (Caspase -3 and Caspase -9) in comparison to the results detected in the I/R untreated rats. It was also observed that PP ameliorated histological changes of I/R injured rats; increased spermatogenetic activity, seminiferous tubular diameter, Leydig cell mass, and reduced expressions of testicular inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Therefore, the therapeutic use of Proxeed Plus could be considered a promising approach in averting testicular damage against I/R injury."

The demographic, clinical, and perioperative characteristics, as well as data on follow-up and complications, were analyzed. Of the 155 patients treated for TT, 15 were included in this study. The average age of the patients was 10.3 years (range: 3.2-13.3 years). All patients experienced a direct scrotal trauma and subsequently presented with an ipsilateral scrotal or testicular pain secondary to the twisted testicle. Six patients were misdiagnosed as having scrotal inflammation or hematoma, and all were initially treated at local hospitals. The mean duration of symptoms before hospitalization was 138 h (range: 5-504 h). The mean degree of torsion was 390° (range: 180-720°). The testicular salvation rate, at 33%, was poor. No serious postoperative complications or recurrences of TT was observed. TITT is a rare entity and still has delayed diagnosis. This may subsequently lead to a low testicular salvation rate. Emergency surgeons, especially in local hospitals, should be aware of the possibility of TT following testicular trauma in pediatric patients. Improving the parents' awareness regarding TT is also important."

We included 16 serious conditions: appendicitis, bacterial meningitis, compartment syndrome, new-onset diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), ectopic pregnancy, empyema, encephalitis, intussusception, mastoiditis, myocarditis, orbital cellulitis, ovarian torsion, sepsis, septic arthritis, stroke, and testicular torsion. Using data from children under 18 years, we compared incidences and complication rates across the ICD-10-CM/PCS transition for each condition using interrupted time series. There were 61 314 ED visits for a serious condition; the most common was appendicitis (n = 37 493). Incidence rates for each condition were not significantly different across the ICD-10-CM/PCS transition for 13/16 conditions. Three differed: empyema (increased 42%), orbital cellulitis (increased 60%), and sepsis (increased 26%). Complication rates were not significantly different for each condition across the ICD-10-CM/PCS transition, except appendicitis (odds ratio 0.62, 95% CI 0.57-0.68), DKA (OR 3.79, 95% CI 1.92-7.50), and orbital cellulitis (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.30-0.95). For most conditions, incidences and complication rates were similar before and after the transition to ICD-10-CM/PCS codes, suggesting our system identifies complications of conditions in administrative data similarly using ICD-9-CM/PCS and ICD-10-CM/PCS codes. This system may be applied to screen for cases with complications and in health services research."

    "title": "Delaying Urgent Exploration in Neonatal Testicular Torsion May Have Significant Consequences for the Contralateral Testis: A Critical Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "To assess the optimal management strategy for boys with neonatal testicular torsion (NTT) in the first 30 days of life, and to stratify outcomes for prenatal, postnatal, unilateral, synchronous, and asynchronous events METHODS: All articles including case reports published between 1946 and 2020 in Embase/Scopus/Medline/Pubmed and Web of Science that had a defined diagnosis of NTT within the first 30 days of life were reviewed. Data and outcomes were analyzed individually, and together as pooled data, using a random effect model. There was a total of 152 studies representing 1336 patients. Outcome data was available on 974 patients (1121 testes). NTT was unilateral in 829 cases, synchronous bilateral in 80 cases, and asynchronous in 66 cases. There were a total of 1107 orchiectomies, and 229 salvage orchiopexies. A total of 2.5% synchronous NTT underwent successful salvage. A total of 95.7% of prenatal unilateral torsions underwent orchiectomy, compared with 92% postnatal torsions. 11.8% of all NTT events were asynchronous with a median time to second torsion of 1 day (Range 1-8). The contralateral orchiectomy rate in this group was 31.8%, with a 40% atrophy rate following orchiopexy. The number needed to treat to avoid bilateral orchiectomy was 1.6, and the number needed to treat to avoid solitary atrophy was 2.6. NTT is an important condition carrying a significant risk for testicular loss and endocrine insufficiency. Given the potential catastrophic risk of asynchronous extravaginal torsion, we recommend urgent, safe, surgical intervention with both unilateral and bilateral NTT."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Testicular torsion (TT) is a common emergency that warrants immediate exploration to prevent infertility or testicular loss. To improve diagnostic reliability, various scoring systems have been published. The aim of this study was to evaluate and validate different testicular torsion scores in a large cohort of children with acute scrotum. Methods: Retrospective analysis of all male children that were admitted for acute scrotum at the Pediatric Surgery Department of the Altonaer Kinderkrankenhaus and University medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf from 01/2013 to 03/2019. Two testicular torsion scores (Boettcher Alert Score, Testicular Workup for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion Score) were applied to all data sets. Furthermore, an artificial intelligence (AI)-based score was developed and compared to the two current scores. Results: In total, 460 boys were included in the study. Of those, 48 (10.4%) had TT. Children with TT suffered most often from short duration of pain, nausea and vomiting, high riding testicle and absent cremasteric reflex. The BALS and the AI-based score had excellent predictive values and all patients with TT would have been detected. Conclusion: The BAL and the AI score show excellent predictive capabilities and may be used to identify all cases of TT in a pediatric population. The scores are easy to apply. As the BALS was slightly better, we advocate to use this score but to validate our findings in prospective multicenter studies."

    "title": "Emergency scrotal exploration in children: Is it time for a change in mindset in the UK?",
    "abstract": "Acute scrotal pain is a common problem in children. Amongst the various causes, only testicular torsion (TT) needs urgent, and arguably any, surgical intervention. However TT accounts for only approximately 25% of cases. The diagnosis of TT is currently based mainly on history and clinical examination in the UK. We sought to find the incidence of finding TT during emergency scrotal exploration in four paediatric surgical centres in the UK. We also assessed the preoperative utilisation of clinical risk scores and Doppler ultrasound (DUS) to aid in the diagnosis. A retrospective review of 50 consecutive scrotal explorations done for acute scrotal pain at four tertiary pediatric surgical centres in 2019, including the preoperative utilisation of DUS, was analysed. Additionally an online survey was also sent out to consultant members of the British Association of Paediatric Urology to gauge their threshold for exploration, use of preoperative investigations and incidence of finding TT in their practice. In the four UK centres reviewed, TT was found in 24.5% (SD = 8.54) of explorations. The overall utilisation of preoperative DUS was 10%. The online survey revealed a low threshold for exploration. However 72% of respondents recalled finding TT in <50% of explorations, with just over a third reporting finding TT in only 10% of explorations. There was low utilisation of preoperative DUS and clinical risk scores. The incidence of finding TT during exploration in this cohort is the same as the incidence of TT in a population of children presenting with acute scrotal pain. We hypothesise that this is due to low accuracy of clinical assessment, low utilisation of preoperative clinical and radiological aids and the practice of exploring torted testicular appendages. Improving awareness and training in these modalities will increase diagnostic accuracy, limiting emergency scrotal explorations to those children with a higher risk of testicular torsion. A care pathway for children presenting with acute scrotal pain is suggested () CONCLUSIONS: There is a low incidence of finding testicular torsion during paediatric scrotal explorations in the UK. There is low preoperative utilisation of clinical risk scores and Doppler ultrasound, which if utilised, could improve diagnostic accuracy."

    "abstract": "Objective: To analyze the risk factors for testicular atrophy (TA) in children with testicular torsion (TT) following emergent orchiopexy. Methods: Clinical data of patients with TT undergoing orchiopexy were retrospectively reviewed, including age at surgery, affected side, delayed surgery (12-24 h and more than 24 h), echogenicity of testicular parenchyma on ultrasonography (ETPU), testicular blood flow on Color Doppler ultrasonography (CDUS), surgical findings (intraoperative blood supply, the degree of torsion, and surgical approaches), and follow-up. The primary outcome was the rate of TA after orchiopexy. The secondary outcome was the testicular volume loss (TVL) between the affected testis and the contralateral. Results: A total of 113 patients were enrolled in this study with a median age of 11 years. The median follow-up was 21 months. Patients had a median TVL of 51.02% and 44 (38.94%) of them developed severe TA during follow-up. TA was significantly associated with age at surgery (P < 0.0001), delayed surgery (P = 0.0003), ETPU (P = 0.0001), and intraoperative blood supply (P = 0.0005). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that school-age children (OR = 0.069, P < 0.001) and puberty (OR = 0.177, P = 0.007) had a decreased risk of TA compared with preschool children, and that heterogeneous ETPU (OR = 14.489, P = 0.0279) and delayed surgery >24 h (OR = 3.921, P = 0.040) increased the risk of TA. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that ETPU (F = 16.349, P < 0.001) and delayed surgery (F = 6.016, P = 0.003) were independent risk factors for TVL. Conclusions: Age at surgery, delayed surgery, and ETPU may play a crucial role in predicting the TA in children with TT following emergent orchiopexy. Moreover, blood flow measured by CDUS could not predict the outcome properly."

    "abstract": "During the COVID-19 crisis, there has been widespread reporting that non-COVID-19-related medical care has been delayed, even for emergent conditions. Testicular torsion is an emergent condition with higher risk of testicular loss with longer ischemic times. We sought to investigate whether patients with testicular torsion had longer time from symptom onset to initial presentation, longer total ischemic time, and higher rate of orchiectomy during the pandemic. Using billing data, we identified all patients age >1yo seen in our hospital from 1/1/2018 through 5/31/2020 who underwent emergent scrotal exploration for confirmed testicular torsion, comparing the COVID-19 crisis (3/1/2020-5/31/20) to the pre-COVID-19 period (1/1/2018-2/29/20). The primary outcome was time from symptom onset to initial presentation and secondary outcomes were ischemic time (time from symptom onset to entry of the OR) and orchiectomy rate. Parameters were compared with Mann-Whitney U and Fisher's exact tests; Poisson regression compared rates of torsion. Of 94 total cases, 77 occurred during the pre-COVID-19 period and 17 during the COVID-19 crisis. Median time from symptom onset to initial presentation was not significantly different (2.4 h [IQR 1.1 h-38.9] during COVID-19 vs. 5.6 h [IQR 1.6-16.9] during pre-COVID-19 period, p = 0.476). Time to presentation was >12 h in 5/17 patients (29%) during COVID-19 and 24/77 patients (31%) during pre-COVID-19 period (p = 1.00). Median ischemic time during COVID-19 was 7.5 h (IQR 4.7 h-45.5 h) compared to 9.4 h (IQR 5.4 h-22.5 h) during pre-COVID-19 period (p = 0.694). Incidence of orchiectomy in our center was 29% (5/17) during COVID-19 and 17% (13/77) during pre-COVID-19 period (p = 0.397). About half of patients were seen initially at outside facilities prior to arrival (47% [8/17] during COVID-19 vs. 49% [38/77] during pre-COVID-19 period, p = 1.00). The number of torsion case presentations per week to our facility increased from 0.7 cases/week in the pre-COVID-19 period to 1.3 cases/week during COVID-19 (p = 0.015); when comparing only the March 1 to May 31 calendar period, there were 0.6 cases/week during the pre-COVID-19 period and 1.3 cases/week during COVID-19 (p = 0.021). Time to presentation, ischemic times, and orchiectomy rates for testicular torsion at our center were not significantly different during the COVID-19 period compared to the preceding 2 year period. The number of torsion case per week presenting to our facility increased significantly."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion (TT) is an emergency requiring a prompt diagnosis and surgery to avoid irreversible changes and a complete loss of testis. The present study aimed to identify potential factors that may be predict a testicular salvage after TT in pediatric patients. Consecutive medical records of all children ≤16 years old with surgically confirmed TT over a period of five years (2011-2016) were collected. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to testicular viability and the type of treatment: Orchidectomy and orchidopexy. The differences between the two groups and potential predictors of testicular salvage were analyzed. Thirty-one boys with TT met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study. The mean age was 13.6 years (range, 10 days - 15.8 years). Testicular salvage was possible in 18 (58.1%) patients. The duration of symptoms and a lesser degree of torsion indicated a testicular salvage in children and adolescents with testicular torsion, but in multivariate analysis only duration of symptoms (time to surgical detorsion) was significantly associated with the risk of non-salvage. At follow-up, testicular atrophy affected 73.3% of the patients treated with orchidopexy. Duration of symptoms is the only predictor of successful testicular salvage following testicular torsion in children. It is associated with a substantial risk of testicular loss and atrophy."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a challenging and time-sensitive diagnosis that is encountered frequently in daily practice, especially in the emergency room. A thorough history, the presence of a painful and swollen testis and testicular ultrasonography plays a vital role in the prompt diagnosis of testicular torsion. Prompt diagnosis is essential to prevent complications of testicular torsion which include testicular infarction, necrosis, and sub/infertility. This can be challenging as there are various other conditions that may mimic the presentation of testicular torsion. Since testicular torsion is an extremely time-sensitive diagnosis, it may also be a subject of many medicolegal challenges. This review article serves as a guide for clinicians involved with the diagnosis and management of testicular torsion. We review and discuss detection and management strategies based on their validity, statistical significance, and effectiveness in enabling prompt diagnosis and management of testicular torsion. Medicolegal implications of testicular torsion are also highlighted."

    "abstract": "As testicular torsion is a medical emergency, it requires quick diagnosis and treatment. Color Doppler ultrasound (CDUS) is useful for the diagnosis of testicular torsion. An accurate diagnosis can be difficult when CDUS indicates the preservation of blood flow in the testis. We examined the accuracy of testicular torsion diagnosis in patients with acute scrotum made by doctors on duty using CDUS. The subjects included 26 patients who visited our department between January 2016 and June 2018 presenting with acute scrotal pain. Patients were placed into one of three groups based on testicular blood flow evaluated by CDUS. The first group had no testicular blood flow, the second had diminished blood flow, and the last group had normal or increased blood flow. Patients were also diagnosed through scrotal exploration. Finally, patients were further divided into two groups identified by CDUS frequency utilized during diagnosis (12 MHz groups and ≤8 MHz groups), and the diagnostic accuracy of the two groups was compared. Characterizing torsion by either the absence of or diminished, testicular blood flow in the CDUS evaluation, the sensitivity and specificity of the CDUS performed by doctors on duty accounted for 69.2% and 53.8%, respectively. No improvement in diagnostic accuracy was evident despite the usage of a 12-MHz ultrasonic transducer. In this study, the sensitivity of CDUS performed by doctors on duty was about 70%, suggesting that scrotal exploration should be performed promptly even if testicular blood flow is observed and testicular torsion is suspected from medical history and body findings."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion (TT) is a serious surgical emergency. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of TT are essential to improve the incidence of salvaged testes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the historical features, physical examination findings, laboratory tests, and ultrasound examinations in children with TT, as well as to identify the predictors of testicular salvage in children. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 136 males who presented with TT to our institution. Clinical findings, physical examinations, laboratory data, color Doppler ultrasound findings, operating results, and the results of follow-up were collected and analyzed. Patients with neonatal torsion, negative scrotal exploration, or testicular appendix torsion were excluded. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify predictors of testicular salvage. Receiver operator characteristics analyses were performed to determine the probability of a non-salvageable torsed testis based on time and degree of twisting. A total of 136 children with TT were identified. Patients were aged from 1 to 16 years, with a mean age of 9.7 years (median, 12; range, 1-16 years). The peak incidences of TT were found between ages of 12 and 14 years. Acute TT is significantly more common in the winter. Testicular salvage occurred in 49 (36%) cases. Of the 49 cases of testicular salvage, 5 patients developed subsequent testicular atrophy. Cutoff values of 13.5 h and 530 degrees of torsion would provide sensitivities of 96 and 61%, with specificity of 80 and 70%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that time to surgery and degree of testicular twist were correlated with the risk of a non-salvageable testis. Testicular salvage can be predicted by the duration of symptoms along with degree of twisting. Early scrotal exploration based on careful physical examination decreases the risk of misdiagnosis of spermatic cord torsion. A certain percentage of children with TT presenting with lower abdominal pain should have their testicles checked to make sure that they do not have torsion, especially those visitors in cold season."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency, requiring time-critical surgery to avoid potential organ loss. This study collates national data on paediatric testicular torsion, offering a comprehensive insight into the current standard of care in England for paediatric patients with suspected testicular torsion. National data collection using Freedom of Information requests. Of 134 acute secondary care NHS trusts in England that treat paediatric patients, responses were received from 121 trusts - representing 140 hospitals - providing a picture of the current standard of care in England. Less than two thirds of hospitals have a paediatric A&E department. One third of hospitals use inter-hospital transfer for paediatric patients with suspected torsion, with variable age restrictions. Mean transfer distance was 19·4 miles (range 2·2 to 61·6 miles). No statistically significant relationship between transfer arrangements and the number of non-viable testicle incidents was found (P = 0·15, ns). There was no correlation demonstrated nationally between size of population served and number of scrotal explorations completed (Pearson's r = 0·20 (CI -0·0·8-0·46), p = 0·16, ns). Qualitative thematic content analysis of serious incident reports identified common themes leading to missed diagnosis and delayed time to theatre: Education and Training, Communication, Transfer Complications, On-site Resources and Cross-site Working. We found variability in resource provision across England, as well as the number of explorations, and the number of unviable testicles found at exploration nationally. We received variable and incomplete data on emergency scrotal explorations and subsequent orchidectomies, very low levels of local audit and limited disclosure of incident reports. A mandatory national audit would allow more comprehensive data collection to accurately identify trends and make informed recommendations. To improve outcomes, we recommend continued education of ED and surgical teams, with mandatory testicular examination for young males presenting with abdominal pain. Whilst streamlining inpatient services is important, the time lost between symptom onset and seeking medical attention is crucial, and raising awareness in the community for young boys and parents may be imperative to improve rates of testicular salvage."

The salvage rate reported in literature remains poor. Discrimination of the onset of a neonatal testicular torsion seems to have an important impact of the salvage rate. Deliveries out of breech presentation have a risk for neonatal complications including neonatal genital birthtrauma. A newborn boy, who was delivered at 40 weeks of gestation out of breech presentation, showed shortly after birth, a painful discoloration and swelling of the scrotum. Clinical examination and ultrasound were highly suspicious for testicular torsion. Emergency surgery revealed a bilateral testicular torsion with dark coloration of both testicles. The testicles were detorted and left in situ. A bilateral orchidopexy was performed. Postoperative ultrasound showed reperfusion of both testicles and the boy was discharged from hospital. Follow-up after 2 months showed normal clinical examination and sonographically persistent perfusion of both testicles. Endocrinological investigations during minipuberty revealed normal hormonal values. We present this rare case in regard to the current literature and recommend close observation of newborns for genital trauma after delivery out of breech position. We encourage surgeons to carefully consider leaving the testicles in situ."

A retrospective cohort study applying TWIST to patients who presented to a pediatric ED with acute testicular pain from December 2017 to June 2019 was performed. Demographics, TWIST score, diagnosis, DUS, consults, and time to the operation were recorded. Patients were stratified into low (LR), intermediate (IR), and high (HR) risk groups for TT based on TWIST score. Descriptive and comparative analyses were performed. Seventy-seven patients were included in the study and had a mean age of 9.24 y ±5.24. All 9 HR patients (TWIST = 5-7) had TT, and none of the 57 LR patients (TWIST = 0-2) had TT. Use of TWIST could have reduced the number of DUS needed to diagnose TT from 69 to 11 (75.3% reduction in DUS). TWIST accurately predicts torsion in HR groups and excludes torsion in LR groups. Application of TWIST to HR patients may eliminate the need for DUS and decrease ischemic time and cost of care. Application of TWIST in LR patients may likewise eliminate the need for DUS and decrease ED length of stay and cost of care."

    "abstract": "Acute testicular torsion is a common urological emergency. Accepted practice is surgical exploration, detorsion, and orchidopexy for a salvageable testis. To critically evaluate the methods of orchidopexy and their outcomes with a view to determining the optimal surgical technique. This review protocol was published via PROSPERO [CRD42016043165] and conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA). EMBASE, MEDLINE, and CENTRAL databases were searched using the following terms: \"orchidopexy\", \"fixation\", \"exploration\", \"torsion\", \"scrotum\", and variants. Article screening was performed by two reviewers independently. The primary outcome was retorsion rate of the ipsilateral testis following orchidopexy. Secondary outcomes included testicular atrophy and fertility. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review on this topic. The search yielded 2257 abstracts. Five studies (n = 138 patients) were included. All five techniques differed in incision and/or type of suture and/or point(s) of fixation. Postoperative complications were reported in one study, and included scrotal abscess in 9.1% and stitch abscess in 4.5%. The contralateral testis was fixed in 57.6% of cases. Three studies reported follow-up duration (range 6-31 wk). No study reported any episodes of ipsilateral retorsion. In the studies reporting ipsilateral atrophy rate, this ranged from 9.1% to 47.5%. Fertility outcomes and patient-reported outcome measures were not reported in any studies. There is limited evidence in favour of any one surgical technique for acute testicular torsion. During the consent process for scrotal exploration, uncertainties in long-term harms should be discussed. This review highlights the need for an interim consensus on surgical approach until robust studies examining the effects of an operative approach on clinical and fertility outcomes are available. Twisting of blood supply to the testis, termed testicular torsion, is a urological emergency. Testicular torsion is treated using an operation to untwist the cord that contains the blood vessels. If the testis is still salvageable, surgery can be performed to prevent further torsion. The method that is used to prevent further torsion varies. We reviewed the literature to assess the outcomes of using various surgical techniques to fix the twisting of the testis. Our review shows that there is limited evidence in favour of any one technique."

We sought to validate the TWIST Score applied by non-expert physicians for the diagnosis of testicular torsion in an adult population. We prospectively analyzed all consecutive males presenting to a tertiary hospital with acute scrotum. Patients with previous scrotal pathology or trauma were excluded.

Measures of accuracy of the TWIST score and ROC curves were generated to evaluate its performance in diagnosing TT in adults. Of 68 patients, 34 had TT (50%). Median age was 24.9 years. According to the original cutoffs of TWIST, 23 patients had a score ≤ 2 among which none had TT. Fifteen patients had a score of 3-4, among which seven had TT. Thirty patients had a score ≥ 5, among which 27 had TT. All 18 patients with a score of 6 or greater had TT (100% PPV). ROC curve revealed an AUC of 0.95.

Semistructured interviews were undertaken with young men (11-19 years), using a topic guide exploring issues surrounding testicular pain and health. Thematic analysis was undertaken using a framework approach. Twenty-seven adolescents were recruited, data saturation was reached at sixteen participants, and median age was 13.5 years (range 11-18). The process by which an adolescent gets to hospital with testicular pain is slow. They must recognize the problem and alert their parents, who then use a 'watch and wait' policy to assess need for medical review, often leaving it 'a day' or overnight. Adolescent males do not engage with healthcare services independently of their parents. Additional factors preventing early presentation include: absence of knowledge about testicular pathology from adolescents and their parents; concern from the young people about raising a false alarm and family concerns about burdening healthcare services. Recommendations include designing a testicular health education campaign for young men and educating parents regarding the medical conditions where a 'watch and wait' policy may be harmful to their child.

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion in children is not uncommon emergency problem which occur due to twist in the spermatic cord leading to ischemia or infarction to testicle. Hemorrhagic infarction can occur following testicular torsion is globally; however, in extremely rare situation, such infarction can be segmental. Segmental testicular infarction (STI) was reported in an infant due to epididymitis and a newborn with STI in 1 testicle with complete infarction in the contralateral testicle due to birth trauma. To best of our knowledge, our case of STI in a child associated with testicular torsion is the first described in the literature."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is an emergency, and unless there is an urgent intervention, irreversible ischaemic damage and gonad loss occur in the testicle. We aimed to investigate myricetin's antioxidant properties as well as its protective effect against ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) damage in the testicular torsion model. A total of 18 rats were divided into three equal groups. Group 1 was the sham group. Group 2: testicular torsion was performed, and orchiectomy was done 2 hr after detorsion. Group 3: received torsion and 1 mg/kg intraperitoneal myricetin was given 30 min before detorsion, and orchiectomy was applied 2 hr after detorsion. We evaluated tissue malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, and catalase levels and Johnsen Testicular Biopsy Score to show its histopathological effect. There was a statistically significant decrease in MDA values in myricetin group compared to Group 2 (p < .017). There was no significant difference in the statistical analysis of SOD and CAT values (p = .337 and p = .025). There was a statistically significant difference in testicular I/R damage in the myricetin group compared to Group 1 and Group 2 (p < .017). Myricetin treatment significantly decreased testicular tissue damage compared to the torsion group but did not reach the values close to the control group."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency that is caused by twisting of the spermatic cord and its content. This condition causes irreversible changes after 6 hours. Early recognition and management of testicular torsion is important for testicular salvage and preservation of fertility. This is a retrospective study done on all patients who presented with acute scrotal pain from January 2013 to December 2017. The data collected included the patient's age, symptoms, the time duration between the onset, ultrasound, and surgery, ultrasound findings with Doppler and the surgical intervention. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 25.0. Data are presented as mean (SD) values. Differences between groups and predictive values were calculated using Chi-square, t-test and Mann-Whitney U-test and are expressed by value with 95% CI. The total number of patients who presented with acute scrotal pain were 88. Testicular torsion was diagnosed in 55 (62.50%) of the patients, 17 (19.32%) had epididymis-orchitis, 5 (5.68%) had torsion of appendage/cyst, and 11 (12.50%) had normal testis. Ultrasound has a sensitivity and specificity of 88.24% and 68.40% respectively. It is a good tool to detect testicular torsion but it is operator dependent. Positive predictive value was 83.33% and negative predictive value was 76.47%. When ultrasound is combined with clinical findings the rate of negative exploration is reduced by 10%. Good medical history, appropriate clinical evaluation and performing an ultrasound of the scrotum are important in testicular torsion. US evaluation in cases presented after 24 hours does not change the outcome."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a known cause of morbidity in pediatric patients, but the burden in the adult population is poorly understood. We sought to determine the incidence of testicular torsion and risk factors for orchiectomy in a population encompassing all ages. A cohort analysis of 1625 males undergoing surgery for torsion was performed using the 2011 and 2012 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Emergency Departments Sample. Patient and hospital factors were examined for association with orchiectomy vs. testicular salvage. The estimated yearly incidence of testicular torsion was 5.9 per 100,000 males ages 1-17 years and 1.3 per 100,000 males ≥18 years. Among those undergoing surgical intervention, orchiectomy was performed in 33.6%. The risk of orchiectomy was highest in patients 1-11 years of age and patients over 50 years of age (46.0% and 69.7% of patients, respectively). Orchiectomy was also associated with public insurance (Medicaid/Medicare) or self-pay as primary payer. While testicular torsion is less common in the adult population, the rate of orchiectomy is high. Those with disadvantaged payer status are also at increased risk for testicular loss."

While for testicular torsion and acute epididymitis clinical recommendations are well established, few is known about low incidence causes of acute scrotal pain. Our aim is to identify and characterise rare differential diagnoses of acute scrotal pain in order to give diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library databases up to February 2019 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. The systematic review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42018099472). Eighty-four publications were selected for analysis. The databases provided mostly case reports, series and small studies, overall reporting on a cohort of 245 cases. Tumors, segmental testicular infarction, testicular vasculitis, pancreatitis, brucellosis, spermatic vein thrombosis, acute aortic syndrome and appendicitis were identified as rare underlying causes of acute scrotal pain and were characterised. As a result of our data analysis we were able to draw an overview of the rare differential diagnoses and diagnostic management of acute scrotal pain. Rare differential diagnoses of acute scrotal pain are susceptible to misinterpretation as testicular torsion or acute epididymo-orchitis. Surgical management is indicated in case of suspicion for torsion or tumor. We herein present knowledge of the rare differential diagnoses and raise awareness for associated systemic disease in order to facilitate disease management and increase the potential for testicle-sparing treatment."

We retrospectively evaluated our patients and aimed to go through our management approach. The newborn patients who underwent surgery for testicular torsion in two tertiary referral centers between 2000 and 2019 are enrolled. Radiological and clinical findings are retrospectively evaluated. Thirty-two newborns are enrolled in the study. All of the cases were unilateral and 30 ended up with immediate orchidectomy while 2 received orchidopexy but both underwent atrophy on follow-up. No bilateral torsion is demonstrated neither in 16 patients with bilateral exploration nor in the follow up of the rest 16 with unilateral exploration. Intravaginal torsion was encountered in five patients (16%). No morbidity or mortality related to anesthesia is documented. No malignancy is encountered in any of the patients. Although ipsilateral testicular salvage rates are low, urgent bilateral exploration in a multidisciplinary center seems reasonable to give a chance to the ipsilateral testis and to avoid the rare but catastrophic bilateral torsion, after discussing with the family."

The urologists see and manage most of these cases in LASUTH. There has been no formal training in this subspeciality. However, both the urologists and paediatric surgeons in LASUTH have acquired some measure of skill and experience over time by virtue of the relatively high volume of the cases seen. This study is aimed at reviewing the practice of paediatric urology in the urology division of LASUTH and to advocate for formal training in an otherwise rare but direly needed subspeciality. The ports of entry of paediatric patients with urologic conditions were assessed retrospectively over a 5-year period (2014-2018). The paediatric age range based on the Lagos State Government policy for health care is from birth to 12 years old. The ports of entry included the urologic outpatient department, paediatric and the adult surgical emergency units and the paediatric wards. Patients referred to and managed by the paediatric surgery division were excluded from this study. The total paediatric urology cases seen and managed by the urologist in LASUTH within the period of review were 421. A total of 363 paediatric urology cases were seen during the period under review, making up 7.96% of the urology cases seen at the surgical outpatient department. The most common cases managed were hypospadias, posterior urethral valves and hydronephrosis. A variety of other cases include priapism, circumcision and post-circumcision injuries, urethral prolapse, testicular torsion, cystic renal dysplasia, disorder of sexual differentiation and several others. Three hundred and seven surgical procedures were done in the period of review on 272 (64.6%) patients.

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a common urologic emergency and one of the causes of genital injury in males. Hence, early diagnosis and treatment are necessary to prevent testicular damage and infertility. It has been proved that topiramate (TPM) a medication used to treat epilepsy and prevent migraines has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects. Therefore, this study was designed to determine the influence of TPM on ischemia/reperfusion injury following testicular torsion/detorsion (T/D). Thirty-six male Wistar rats were divided into three groups (n = 12 for each group) including sham operated, T/D + vehicle, T/D + TPM(100 mg/kg, 30 min before detorsion). Testicular torsion was induced for 1 h by rotating right testis 7200 in the clockwise direction. After 5 h of reperfusion the testis was removed and histological changes and biochemical markers such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT) and levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were evaluated. MDA level significantly increased and GSH level significantly decreased after T/D compared to the sham group (p < 0.001). Moreover, after inducing testicular T/D, GPx, CAT and SOD activity were decreased, whereas administration of TPM significantly increased GSH level and GPx, CAT and SOD activities and decreased MDA level in testis tissue as compared to T/D group. After induction of T/D, histopathological evaluations also revealed severe testicular damages which were improved by TPM administration. Our results indicate that TPM had an ameliorating impact on ischemia/reperfusion injury in the rat model of testicular T/D. This protective effect was most likely induced by anti-oxidative properties of this drug."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is an urological emergency and an important cause of male infertility. Recent studies have shown that not only ischemia, but also the restoration of blood flow creates a deleterious situation for the testis. The goal of this work was to evaluate the role of systemic epithelial growth factor application and its association with decompressive fasciotomy in tissue recovery of the testes undergoing the torsion of the spermatic cord. Torsion of the spermatic cord was induced in 40 Wistar pubescent testes for a period of 4 h. At the time of detorsion systemic epithelial growth factor and decompressive fasciotomy were applied as treatment alternatives. After 21 days, the testicles were examined macro and microscopically. The variables evaluated were weight, testicular volume and the degree of histological alterations by optical microscopy. The rate of healing of testicular torsion showed significant difference between the groups. It was noted that in terms of testicular weight and volume the animals treated with systemic epithelial growth factor resembled the control group and had a better histological classification than the other groups. The mean Johnsen score was significantly higher in the group treated with systemic growth factor and decompressive testicular fasciotomy than in the group without fasciotomy. No significant changes were noted in the contralateral testes. Although decompressive testicular fasciotomy improved spermatogenesis, recovery was limited. Systemic epithelial growth factor administered in combination with decompressive testicular fasciotomy was more effective for spermatogenesis than fasciotomy alone. Administering epithelial growth factor after reperfusion might have the potential to decrease long-term histologic damage after testicular torsion. The combination of decompressive testicular fasciotomy and epithelial growth factor had a synergistic effect on the healing of these testes."

The present study aimed to evaluate the role of preoperative manual detorsion in the management of testicular torsion. Retrospective data analysis of pediatric patients treated for acute testicular torsion at a tertiary center over the last 5 years. Manual detorsion was attempted by surgeon's preference. Successful manual detorsion was defined as complete pain resolution with a normal color Doppler ultrasound. All patients underwent surgical exploration. Patient data analyzed included: age, pain duration, site of onset, attempt of manual detorsion, pain relief after manual detorsion, color Doppler ultrasound results, surgical findings and outcome. One hundred twenty-two patients were included. Manual detorsion was attempted in 48% (58/122) cases. Manual detorsion was successful in 26% (15/58) patients. In the unsuccessful, residual cord torsion was found at surgery in 27.5% (16/58); in the remaining 27, there was no cord torsion at surgery. Five patients (5/15) with successful manual detorsion underwent elective orchiopexy. Gonadal loss after manual detorsion (9%, 5/58) occurred after unsuccessful manual detorsion, all submitted to emergency surgery. Testicular torsion warrants prompt detorsion. Manual detorsion is simple, immediately available, and maximizes testis salvage. A successful maneuver permits nonemergency orchiopexy. An algorithm for the management of testicular torsion that includes an attempt of manual detorsion prior to surgery is proposed. Treatment study. Level IV."

This was a 42-year-old patient admitted to the emergency department for abdominal pain that had been evolving for a week. The physical examination showed tenderness and guarding in the left iliac fossa with an empty ipsilateral hemiscrotum. Complementary examinations led to the discovery of an intra-abdominal left-lateral mass. The laparotomy found a whitish mass with areas of infarction, which was resected. Anatomopathological examination of the operative specimen identified it as a testis with atrophy of germ cells and necrotic areas without evidence of malignancy. Conclusion. Intra-abdominal testicular torsion should be considered in case of patients with an acute surgical abdomen with vacuity of one of the bursae."

A total of 28 patients with testicular torsion were recruited from the Emergency Surgery Department of Beijing Children's Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University from July 2016 to July 2018. Among these patients, 22 patients (age: 10.80 ± 3.50 years old) were treated with manual reduction using the elastic retraction method and push-and-turn method. Observation indexes included dramatically alleviated or completely disappeared pain without general anesthesia; the spermatic cord being smooth and unknotted; the restoration of the suffered testis to normal anatomical position under ultrasonography monitoring; blood flow signals increased in the affected testis and epididymis, which was regarded as the main sign of a successful reduction. Among the 22 cases who received manual reduction, 19 patients were successfully treated (left side: n = 11, right side: n = 8) with a total success rate of 86.36%. The other three cases showed either incomplete (n = 2) or failed (n = 1) reposition. Among the 19 patients who were successfully treated by manual reduction, 2 of them did not undergo prophylactic orchiopexy, and no abnormalities were found during the follow-up. The reduction of testicular torsion using the elastic retraction method and push-and-turn method may improve the success rate of the manual reduction of testicular torsion, especially for incomplete testicular torsion. Furthermore, manual reduction may help increase the rate of testicular salvage in a timely manner before emergency surgery. Hence, this skill should be extended to primary hospitals to reduce the possibility of testectomy caused by testicular torsion."

    "abstract": "Background. Testicular torsion is a common surgical emergency in children that requires a high index of suspicion, early diagnosis, and exploration. Most children present early to their primary pediatricians or physicians. The aim of this retrospective study is to determine the surgical outcome of testicular torsion with early as well as delayed presentation or referral at our pediatric surgical unit. Methods. Records of 50 patients who presented with testicular torsion at our pediatric surgical unit over the span of 10 years (2007-2017) were reviewed retrospectively. The duration and characteristics of symptoms, initial consultation with primary care health professional, time duration between the initial consultation and referral to a tertiary care center, clinical findings prior to surgery, and operative findings were noted. Results. Fifty patients were in the age group ranging from 38 days to 18 years. All the patients consulted the primary care health professionals within 3 to 6 hours after the onset of testicular pain. The patients presented to our hospital within the range of 3.5 hours to 10 days of onset of initial symptoms. Out of 50 patients who presented to our hospital with torsion testis, 45 (90%) patients underwent orchidectomy as the testicle was gangrenous and 5 patients underwent orchiopexy as the testicle was viable. Conclusion. The risk of testicular loss is very high if there is delay in the initial diagnosis of testicular torsion. Greater effort in educating the primary health care professionals may reduce this delay. Primary objective of treating the acute scrotum should be prevention of testicular loss than treating symptoms."

We aim to identify the most influential points in the pathway in determining whether patients are managed in the appropriate time frame, so these areas can be targeted to improve salvage rates. Using quality improvement principles, the pediatric scrotal pain pathway was mapped out, commencing with initial symptom onset and ending with definitive surgical management. We retrospectively reviewed data on all patients between 0 and 18 years of age attending the emergency department at Whipps Cross University Hospital with acute scrotal pain between October 2010 and October 2013. Over the 3-year period, 238 patients 18 years or younger presented to casualty with scrotal pain. Of the patients assessed initially by an emergency department physician, 52.8% (n = 67) were discharged without referral. To our knowledge, none of these patients presented later with a missed torsion. Torsion was diagnosed in 23.2% of the patients operated on (n = 22), of which 5 required orchidectomy, comprising 2.1% of all patients presenting with scrotal pain. In this group, 4 were due to late presentation by the patient. We demonstrate the value of different stages of the pathway, as more than half of patients seen in A&E were correctly discharged without referral. In the context of our study, late presentation to hospital appears to be the most significant factor leading to orchidectomy. To target this issue, awareness among both children and parents must be improved."

This study has the following objectives: (1) to compare the actual time to surgery (aTTS) to the ideal time to surgery among patients undergoing emergency surgery and (2) to explore the use of home to emergency department time (HET) as a new measurement indicator for time from symptoms onset to admission at ED at a referral hospital. We performed a retrospective review of emergency general surgery cases performed at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Kigali in Rwanda between June 1 and November 31, 2016. Our primary outcomes included actual time to surgery (aTTS) in hours (defined as time from admission at ED to induction of anesthesia) and actual home to emergency department (ED) time (aHET) in days (defined as time from onset of symptoms to admission at ED). Our secondary outcome was the overall in-hospital mortality rate. During the study period, 148 emergency surgeries were performed. Most of the patients were male (80%), aged between 15 and 65 (69%), from outside Kigali (72%), and with insurance (80%). The most common diagnosis was abdominal trauma (24%), followed by peritonitis (20%), and intestinal obstruction (16%). The median aTTS was 7.8 h, and the median aHET was 2.43 days. Most patients (77%) experienced delays in timely surgery after admission to ED, and aTTS was 15.5 h for Fournier's gangrene, 10.8 h for abdominal trauma, 11.3 h for appendicitis, 10.5 h for intestinal obstructions, and 12.3 h for peritonitis. Likewise, most patients (52%) experienced delays in reaching the ED, especially those with appendicitis (15.2 days), peritonitis (8.5 days), testicular torsion (7.2 days), Fournier's gangrene (5 days), and intestinal obstruction (3.7 days). The case fatality rate by diagnosis was highest for polytrauma (100%) and peritonitis (60%); the overall in-hospital mortality rate was 23%. Some of the poor outcomes associated with in-hospital delay include reoperation and death. Factors to consider in triage for referral include age, diagnosis, and high risk of death. Our study found that the median aTTS was 7.8 h and most patients (77%) were delayed in having timely surgery after admission at ED. In addition, the median aHET was 2.5 days and most patients (52%) were delayed in reaching the ED. Improving processes to facilitate access and to perform timely emergency surgery through the referral system has a potential to decrease delay and improve outcomes."

At 17 years of age, he presented with left acute scrotum due to testicular torsion of the left supernumerary testis. Counterclockwise 720-degree rotation of the left supernumerary testis was noted during emergency surgery, and orchidopexy of the 3 testes (2 left testes and 1 right testis) was performed. Biopsy of the left supernumerary testis demonstrated spermatogenesis and no malignancy. One and a half years after surgery, all testes were viable without atrophy.Polyorchidism is a rare condition and there is no consensus on the management of asymptomatic cases detected early in life. The position of the supernumerary testis (intrascrotal or extrascrotal) is important when deciding the management strategy because of the risk of malignancy. If conservative management is selected initially, elective surgery, such as prophylactic orchiectomy or orchidopexy, may be needed because of the risk of malignancy and torsion."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a urological emergency both in childhood and in adult life. Many studies on experimental testicular torsion have demonstrated biochemical and pathological ischemia-reperfusion injury and the efficacy of some drugs have been investigated to prevent this damage. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) promotes glutathione synthesis and acts as a glutathione precursor because of the fact that it increases the glutathione-reductase activity by transporting sulfhydryl groups. In this experimental study, the authors aimed to investigate the effectiveness of NAC in preventing ischemia-reperfusion injury following testicular torsion and detorsion. For this experimental study, 36 albino Wistar-male rats were used. The rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: sham (n = 8), ischemia-reperfusion (n = 8), ischemia-NAC -reperfusion (n = 10), and ischemia-NAC-reperfusion-NAC (n = 10) groups. Two hours of torsion and 4 h of detorsion were created in the left testis. After 4 h of detorsion, the rats were sacrificed. Each tissue was divided into two sections for biochemical and pathological examinations. There was a statistically significant difference between the study groups in terms of the total-sulfhydryl level, nitric oxide level, and the malondialdehyde values. Histopathological examination revealed that NAC was effective in preventing reperfusion injury in the testis but ineffective in preventing the reduction in the spermatid count. The results of this experimental study support that NAC can histopathologically maintain the structure of seminiferous tubules against ischemis reperfusion injury and prevent damage to the germinative cells. However, it was unable to prevent the reduction in spermatid count. There was no significant difference in the prevention of ischemia-reperfusion injury between NAC administration during the first hour of ischemia and NAC administration during reperfusion. Although NAC can prevent tissue damage from ischemia reperfusion injury, it is not effective against the reduction in the spermatid count. N-acetylcysteine may be biochemically effective in preventing ischemia-reperfusion injury after testicular torsion and detorsion. NAC is a readily available and easy to use agent that can be used during testicular ischemia."

Final diagnosis identified 72 patients with torsion of the appendix testis, 44 patients with epididymitis, and 38 patients with TT. Testes were salvaged in 23 of the 38 patients with TT (60.5%). Statistically significant variables revealed that the risk factors of TT were age (older than 12 years), white blood cell (WBC) count (>12,000 cells/mm3), and laterality (left side). The level of C-reactive protein (CRP), duration of symptoms, and degree of torsion were significantly higher in the non-salvageable testis group than in the salvageable testis group. Furthermore, the significant predictive factor for non-salvageable testis was the level of CRP >1.0 mg/dl. The study results indicates that age, WBC count, and laterality are key factors to distinguish TT from AS. Salvageability largely depended on the duration of symptoms and the degree of TT. The salvage rate of the testis can be improved by educating pediatricians, parents, patients, and medical staff about the early diagnosis and treatment of torsion."

    "abstract": "We present two cases of young men with spontaneous nontraumatic testicular pain. While the differential diagnosis for scrotal or testicular pain can include less urgent causes, such as epididymitis, hydrocele, referred pain, idiopathic scrotal edema, and inguinal hernia, for example, the most feared etiology for acute scrotal pain is testicular torsion. The fact that a testicle can torse and detorse is also a confounding factor. In this case review, we explore factors affecting the timely diagnosis, management, and outcomes of acute testicular pain. Prompt diagnosis is imperative in order to salvage a torsed testicle."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is an urgent urological condition. Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) processes that occur after detorsion as a treatment for torsion are caused by testicular injury. The purpose of our study is investigating the protecting effect of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on the testicular ischemia reperfusion injury. Thirty-eight Wistar-Albino rats were divided randomly into 6 different groups: Control (6); sham (6); IR-E (6)-2 h of torsion and 4 h of reperfusion; IR-E + H2S (6)-in addition to the IR-E group, 75 μmol/kg of sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS) was administered intraperitoneally 30 min before reperfusion; IR-L (7)-2 h of torsion and 24 h of reperfusion; IR-L + H2S (7)-in addition to the IR-L group, 75 μmol/kg NaHS was administered intraperitoneally 30 min before reperfusion. Biochemically, nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), reductive glutathione (GSH), and tumor TNF-α levels were measured in the testis. Serum TNF-α levels were also measured. Hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) was used for histopathological staining and microscopic findings were examined. The Johnsen score was performed to assess spermatogenesis activity in the testis. Apoptosis protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity were evaluated immunohistochemically as well. Statistical analyses were made by the Chi-squared test and one-way analysis of variance. MDA and NO levels were significantly increased in the IR-L group compared with sham and which decreased by the addition of H2S treatment to the IR-L group (p < 0.05) in biochemical evaluation. GSH vs SOD levels were decreased in the IR-L group compared with sham and which increased by the addition of H2S treatment to the IR-L group, but this correlations were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Tissue and serum TNF-α levels were significantly increased in the IR-E group compared with sham and which decreased by the addition of H2S treatment to the IR-E group. Johnsen score was the lowest in IR-L group (p < 0.05). Apaf-1 and iNOS activity were significantly increased in the IR-L group compared with sham and which decreased by the addition of H2S treatment to the IR-L group (p < 0.05) in immunohistochemical evaluation. First, the authors would like to say that H2S treatment is protective and it is against ischemia reperfusion injury in testicular torsion. The anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiapoptotic properties of H2S caused protective effect as shown in this study."

    "abstract": "Spermatic cord torsion is a serious and common urologic emergency. It requires early diagnosis for prevention of subfertility and testicular necrosis. Vildagliptin and sitagliptin are anti-diabetic drugs of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors that have a protective role against cerebral ischemic stroke and cardiac ischemia reperfusion. This study aimed to investigate the role and mechanism of action of vildagliptin and sitagliptin in a model of testicular ischemia/reperfusion injury by testicular torsion/detorsion (T/D). Testicular T/D was done and vildagliptin and sitagliptin were administered either alone or in combination with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor. Serum total cholesterol and testosterone were measured, while in testicular tissue testosterone, malondialdehyde (MDA) level, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), nitric oxide level, caspase-3, superoxide dismutase (SOD), hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and endothelial NOS (eNOS), and inducible NOS (iNOS) and neuronal NOS (nNOS) were measured. Histopathology of testicular tissue was done. Vildagliptin and sitagliptin increased serum testosterone, expression, and activity of SOD and testicular TAC. It also reduced total serum cholesterol, testicular MDA, caspase-3, HIF-1α, TNF-α, and expression of eNOS, iNOS, and nNOS. Vildagliptin and sitagliptin also improved histopathological picture of testicular tissue. NOS inhibitor produced similar result to DDP-4 inhibitors; however, its co-administration augmented the effect of vildagliptin and sitagliptin on these parameters. DPP-4 inhibitors, vildagliptin, and sitagliptin were protective against testicular T/D-induced injury mostly by anti-oxidative stress, and anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory actions that was augmented by NOS inhibition with a possible role for HIF-1α expression."

    "abstract": "To evaluate the features of testicular torsion presenting with acute abdominal pain and to raise awareness of testicular torsion with specific symptoms. From October 2005 to June 2016, nine patients with testicular torsion who presented with isolated acute abdominal pain rather than scrotal pain as their primary symptom were retrospectively reviewed. Data, including the age of patients, season at admission, initial medical history, external genital examination, emergency ultrasound findings, operative findings, duration of abdominal pain, complications, and follow-up results, were collected. The average age of patients was 14 years (range 10-17 years). Seven patients whose genitals were not initially examined externally were misdiagnosed as having ordinary abdominal diseases. Surgical exploration revealed that all the involved testes necrotized, and orchidectomy was performed. In the other two patients, scrotal and testicular abnormalities were detected immediately on admission, and emergency surgical exploration determined that the involved testis remained vital, so orchiopexy was performed. The mean duration from symptom onset to diagnosis was 4 h (3-5 h) in the orchiopexy group and 37 h (18-72 h) in the orchidectomy group. Six patients were psychologically affected during postoperative follow-up. Neither recurrence of testicular torsion nor testicular atrophy was recorded. Acute abdominal pain can be the initial and sole symptom of testicular torsion in young males. Physicians should pay close attention to the specific clinical presentation of testicular torsion."

This study aimed to quantify higher surgical trainee operative experience and confidence in managing suspected testicular torsion in a single UK deanery (Wales). Anonymised logbook data were obtained via the Intercollegiate Surgical Curriculum Programme version 10 using the head of school report function for all general surgery (n=53) and urology (n=15) higher surgical trainees, which were combined with the distribution of an electronic self-administered questionnaire. Median operative scrotal explorations recorded for all general surgery higher surgical trainees and senior general surgery higher surgical trainees (ST7+) was 7 (range 1-22) and 10 (range 1-22), compared with 21 (range 9-64, p=0.00104) and 24 (19-64, p<0.001) for urology higher surgical trainees. The questionnaire response rate was 64.6% (general surgery 31/50, urology 11/15). Confidence levels in assessing adult and paediatric patients were lower in general surgery when compared with urology higher surgical trainees: median adult confidence rate 7/10 compared with 9/10, and paediatric confidence rate 7/10 compared with 8/10 (p<0.001 and p=0.053, respectively). All higher surgical trainees preferred urology as the accountable hospital specialty when both assets were available. General surgery higher surgical trainees receive less than 50% of the operative exposure of urology higher surgical trainees in emergency scrotal surgery, which has important implications for curriculum competence development and patient safety."

    "abstract": "Scrotal ultrasound helps in the rapid diagnosis of complete testicular torsion and assessment of alternative causes of acute scrotal pain. Early detection of torsion of the testis and reperfusion, either manually or surgically, is paramount to preserving testicular viability. Manual detorsion also offers immediate symptom relief by alleviating ischemia. Bedside ultrasound performed by a trained emergency physician (EP) can significantly reduce the time to diagnosis and reperfusion by means of performing an ultrasound-guided manual detorsion in the emergency department (ED). We report two cases of ultrasound-guided manual detorsion of testis that were performed successfully by EPs in the ED. After manual detorsion, both patients underwent nonemergent orchidopexy and recovered well after surgery. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Manual testicular detorsion is a simple, safe, and effective maneuver that can be performed in the ED by EPs. Bedside ultrasound is helpful in confirming the diagnosis of complete torsion of the testicle (no blood flow) and successful reperfusion after manual detorsion. We recommend EPs be trained to perform scrotal ultrasound and manual detorsion of a torted testicle. We strongly emphasize that manual detorsion of the testes is not a substitute for definitive surgical management and should only be used as a temporary measure for reperfusion to allow more time to organize the logistics of surgery, which can be critical in remote settings."

    "abstract": "A 16-year-old male patient with no known medical history presented at the Emergency Department (ED) with a 2-day history of pain and swelling in his right hemiscrotum. He was diagnosed with non-bacterial epididymitis and discharged home with medical advice. Six days after being diagnosed, the pain and swelling worsened and he was seen by a general practitioner who concluded that the symptoms were attributable to the previously diagnosed epididymitis. No further investigations were performed. Two days later he again presented at the ED, at which time colour Doppler echography revealed a testicular torsion of probably two days old. As after operative detorsion the testis was found to be non-vital, an orchidectomy was performed. This case illustrates that the diagnosis of epididymitis should always be reviewed in patients in whom the scrotum once again becomes painful. Early recognition and treatment of torsio testis gives a better chance of keeping the testis and therefore fertility."

    "abstract": "The dilemma of acute non-traumatic abdominal pathologies in the pediatric population depends on the age of the patients and symptoms. Surgical etiologies in patients younger than 2 years of age include intussusception, pyloric stenosis, malrotation and midgut volvulus. In older patients, considerations become closer to differential etiologies in adults including acute appendicitis. Ultrasound and fluoroscopic examinations remain the mainstay for diagnosis that may even be therapeutic such as contrast/air enemas in intussusception reduction. There is an increasing role for CT in appendicitis and renal colic especially in assessing complications; however, it is less favored because it incurs radiation to the patient. This article summarizes the imaging approach to pediatric patients with acute abdominal pathologies presenting to the emergency department, and how imaging is instrumental in guiding diagnosis and treatment, with emphasis on radiation safety, in the context of providing typical imaging findings of each pathology in this pictorial review."

    "abstract": "Acute abdomen is a medical emergency with a wide spectrum of etiologies. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) can help in early identification and management of the causes. The ACUTE-ABDOMEN protocol was created by the authors to aid in the evaluation of acute abdominal pain using a systematic sonographic approach, integrating the same core ultrasound techniques already in use-into one mnemonic. This mnemonic ACUTE means: A: abdominal aortic aneurysm; C: collapsed inferior vena cava; U: ulcer (perforated viscus); T: trauma (free fluid); E: ectopic pregnancy, followed by ABDOMEN which stands: A: appendicitis; B: biliary tract; D: distended bowel loop; O: obstructive uropathy; Men: testicular torsion/Women: ovarian torsion. The article discusses two cases of abdominal pain the diagnosis and management of which were directed and expedited as a result of using the ACUTE-ABDOMEN protocol. The first case was of a 33-year-old male, who presented with a 3-day history of abdominal pain, vomiting and constipation. Physical exam revealed a soft abdomen with generalized tenderness and normal bowel sounds. Laboratory tests were normal. A bedside ultrasound done using the ACUTE-ABDOMEN protocol showed signs of intussusception. This was confirmed by CT-abdomen. The second case was of a 70-year-old female, a known case of diabetes and hypertension, who presented with a 3-hour history of abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea. She had a normal physical exam and laboratory studies. Her symptoms mimicking simple gastroenteritis had improved. However, bedside ultrasound, using the ACUTE-ABDOMEN protocol showed localized free fluid with dilated small bowel loop in right lower quadrant with absent peristalsis. A CT abdomen confirmed a diagnosis of intestinal obstruction. These two cases demonstrate that the usefulness of applying POCUS in a systematic method-like the \"ACUTE-ABDOMEN\" approach-can aid in patient diagnosis and management. We are presenting two cases of undifferentiated acute abdomen pain, where ACUTE ABDOMEN sonographic approach was applied and facilitated the accurate patient management and disposition. ACUTE ABDOMEN sonographic approach in acute abdomen can play an important role in ruling out critical diagnosis, and can guide emergency physician or any critical care physician in patient management."

Non-sutured techniques may avoid the theoretical morbidities of sutured fixation of the testis yet are criticized for insufficient prophylaxis against future torsion. This study aims to compare outcomes between sutured (point-fixation) versus Jaboulay fixation. Emergency scrotal explorations performed at a tertiary hospital in the state of South Australia between February 2002 and December 2017 were analyzed to identify cases of testicular torsion. Primary outcome measures included future testicular torsions and return to theater episodes following initial testicular fixation. Secondary outcome measures included re-presentations and post-operative complications. A total of 482 scrotal compartments were explored in 244 boys with acute testicular torsion. Testis fixation was performed using sutured point-fixation in 58.4% and Jaboulay tunica plication in 41.6%. No future testicular torsion occurred regardless of fixation technique. There were no significant differences in returns to theater (0.4% versus 1.2%, p = 0.12), re-presentations (6.9% versus 6.0%, p = 0.83), and post-operative complications (1.7% versus 1.8%, p = 1.0) in testes that previously underwent sutured or Jaboulay fixation, respectively.

A systematic search of Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases was performed in January 2019 using specific search terms. Selected studies were ranked and evaluated using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool.

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a serious urologic emergency and one of the causes of infertility in males. Hence, prompt diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent testicular damages. It has been proved that dapsone (4, 40 diamino-diphenyl sulfone) has anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of dapsone on ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in bilateral testes after unilateral testicular torsion/detorsion (T/D) in rats. In this experiment, eighteen male Wistar rats were allocated into three groups, including sham-operated, T/D + vehicle, and T/D + dapsone (12.5 mg/kg). Testicular torsion was induced for 1 h by rotating right (ipsilateral) testis 7200 in the clockwise direction. After 7 days of reperfusion, bilateral orchiectomy was conducted and evaluations of biochemical markers - tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) - and histological changes were performed. While induction of testicular T/D remarkably increased the level of TNF-α in the ipsilateral (torted) and contralateral (non-torted) testes, intraperitoneal (i.p) administration of dapsone (12.5 mg/kg) significantly lowered the TNF-α level (p < 0.001). Additionally, after induction of T/D, SOD activity was notably decreased, whereas administration of dapsone (12.5 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly raised SOD activity in the bilateral testes (p < 0.001). I/R injury also caused lesions in the microscopic pattern of the bilateral testicular tissues, while administration of dapsone (12.5 mg/kg, i.p.) led to a significant improvement in testicular damages. It was concluded that dapsone had a protective impact on I/R injury in the rat model of testicular T/D, and this effect was most likely induced by anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties of dapsone."

Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is increasingly used by urologists and emergency physicians and could potentially be used to detect pediatric testicular torsion. This study aimed to determine the accuracy of POCUS by pediatric emergency physicians in diagnosing testicular torsion and the agreement between point-of-care ultrasound and final diagnosis for other causes of acute scrotum. A chart review of patients presenting to the study emergency department who received POCUS by a pediatric emergency physician, as well as radiology department ultrasound and/or surgery, was performed. Charts were reviewed for POCUS diagnoses, final diagnoses, and imaging time metrics. A total of 120 patients met study criteria, with 12 cases of testicular torsion. The diagnostic accuracy of POCUS for testicular torsion is described in the summary table. For all causes of acute scrotum, point-of-care ultrasound agreed with final diagnosis in 70% (95% confidence interval [CI] 62-78%) of cases, and more experienced point-of-care ultrasound users displayed higher agreement with final diagnosis. Point-of-care ultrasound results were generated a median of 73 min (Q1 = 51, Q3 = 112) before radiology department ultrasound results. Scrotal POCUS performed by pediatric emergency physicians appears to be an accurate tool to detect testicular torsion in children with acute scrotum and saves time compared with radiology ultrasound. The study results may not be generalizable to hospitals without a multidisciplinary POCUS system for quality assurance and image sharing. Future work on POCUS for acute scrotum should investigate its impact on patient outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and family satisfaction. Point-of-care ultrasound by pediatric emergency physicians is accurate for detecting testicular torsion in children with acute scrotum and could expedite diagnosis of this time-sensitive condition."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is an urological emergency that may lead to infertility due to ischemic injury. Promptly surgical correction by orchiopexy is the only way to avoid infertility and no effective treatment for restoration of spermatogenesis. We previously reported that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), through local injection upon testicular torsion-detorsion, restored the spermatogenesis without differentiation into sperm. In this study, molecular mechanisms of MSCs in regulating germ cell activity induced by testicular torsion-detorsion were investigated. Sixteen male Sprague-Dawley rats 6-8 weeks old received left testis 720° torsion for 3 h followed by detorsion with or without MSCs. Right inguinal skin incision without testicular torsion served as control. MSCs with 3 × 104 cells were locally injected into left testis 30 min before detorsion. Three days after the surgery, orchiectomy was executed and the testis, epididymis, and sperm were separated to each other. Functional assessments on sperm included counting sperm amount and sperm motility, staining F-actin, and quantifying adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content. The hallmarks of glycogenesis and glycolysis in each tissue segment were measured by Western blot. Testicular torsion-detorsion significantly decreased the amount of sperm, inhibited the motility, declined the F-actin expression, and reduced the content of ATP in sperm. Local injection of MSCs improved sperm function, particularly in sperm motility. With MSCs, ATP content and F-actin were preserved after testicular torsion-detorsion. MSCs significantly reversed the imbalance of glycolysis in sperm and testis induced by testicular torsion-detorsion, as evidenced by increasing the expression of phosphoglycerate kinase 2 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-spermatogenic, activating Akt, and increasing glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), which led to the increase in glycolysis cascades and ATP production. Human stem cell factor contributed the activation of Akt/GSK3 axis when sperm suffered from testicular torsion-detorsion-induced germ cell injury. Local injection of MSCs into a testis damaged by testicular torsion-detorsion restores sperm function mainly through the improvement of sperm motility and energy. MSCs reversed the imbalance of glycogenesis and glycolysis in sperm by regulating Akt/GSK3 axis. Thus, MSCs may potentially rescue torsion-detorsion-induced infertility via local injection."

    "abstract": "Timely diagnosis and management of testicular torsion is of paramount importance. Furthermore, time to surgical intervention is a benchmark for the quality of care provided by pediatric urologists included in US News and World Report (USNWR) methodology. We sought to optimize management of acute testicular torsion at a single institution by decreasing time from presentation to definitive management through the creation and implementation of a clinical care pathway (accelerated care of torsion or ACT) for acute testicular torsion in a 2-year period. Multidisciplinary process mapping involving the emergency department (ED), radiology, anesthesiology, peri-operative services, and operating room (OR) teams resulted in development of the ACT pathway with the goal of achieving surgical intervention within 4 h of arrival at our institution. The accelerated care of torsion pathway was implemented in April 2016. Thirty-eight consecutive acute torsion cases were then prospectively evaluated from April 2016 to April 2018. For process measures, we recorded triage to OR times and mode of presentation. For outcome measures, we examined orchiectomy rates. We retrospectively reviewed 97 cases of acute torsion from 2004 to 2016 as a control. Time from ED triage to OR start decreased from a median 196 min (interquartile range [IQR] 137-249 min) to 127 min (IQR 100-148 min; P < 0.0001) for all cases of acute torsion. In the control group, 72% of cases met the USNWR criteria for acute treatment of torsion. After ACT implementation, 100% of cases reached the OR within the 240 min time frame. Orchiectomy rates were performed in 24% of control cases vs 30% after ACT implementation (P = NS). Survival curve analysis demonstrated no significant difference in probability of testis salvage before or after implementation of the ACT pathway. In agreement with similar studies, despite a significant reduction in triage to OR times, the orchiectomy rate approached 30%. This outcome did not significantly improve after implementation of the ACT pathway. Overall ischemia time was a more important determinant of testis salvage. Study limitations include limited patient follow-up to assess testis atrophy. The multidisciplinary creation and implementation of a clinical pathway for the care of acute testis torsion has significantly decreased the time from ED to OR in our institution. However, overall orchiectomy rate was not significantly affected."

The accuracy of electronic discharge summaries (EDSs) for patients undergoing acute scrotal exploration has previously been shown to be poor. The objective of this study was to assess accuracy of EDS in patients undergoing acute scrotal exploration in a tertiary paediatric hospital. This study aimed to determine if a new EDS system, whereby the operative procedure is automatically transcribed into the EDS, improves the information within the EDS. Retrospective review of the EDS for all patients undergoing acute scrotal exploration between 1st April 2014 and 31st March 2016 was carried out. During this period, a new EDS system, whereby the operative procedure is automatically transcribed to the EDS, was introduced on 20th June 2015. The old system (1st April 2014 to 19th June 2015) was compared with the new system (20th August 2015 to 31st March 2016). A total of 181 patients were included. A diagnosis was not documented in 25 (14%) and was inconsistent with the operation notes in 56 (31%). An operative procedure was not documented at all in 13 (7%) and was inconsistent with the operation notes in 43 (24%). The laterality of pain was not documented and/or incorrect in 11 (6%). The new system in which the operative procedure is automatically transcribed to the EDS resulted in an improvement of diagnoses (78% vs 96%; p = 0.0022; old vs new) and procedures (95% vs 100%; p = 0.0218; old vs new) being documented but not the accuracy. The EDS prepared for patients undergoing acute scrotal exploration frequently exhibit inaccuracies; a system that automatically transcribes the operative procedure into the EDS results in modest improvement."

    "title": "Door To Detorsion Time Determines Testicular Survival.",
    "abstract": "To determine the importance of the duration of in-hospital management of patients with testicular torsion for testes survival. The time from onset of symptoms until surgery is a well-known factor determining testicular survival but there is no data regarding the contribution of in-hospital management duration to testicular survival. Unlike the time from onset of symptoms until seeking medical attention, the time from registration to the emergency department (ED) to the time of detorsion-\"Door To Detorsion time\" (DTD) is dependent on medical providers and should be minimized. Data was retrieved on all patients who underwent surgery for testicular torsion in 1994-2014 (N = 219). We used multivariable logistic regression analysis to examine independent association between DTD time or duration of symptoms to testicular survival. Median DTD time was 135 minutes (range 23-546). Among patients with a viable testis, median DTD time was 107 minutes (range 35-381) compared to 160 minutes (range 23-546) among patients with a nonviable testis (P <.001). Logistic regression models showed that both DTD time (P = .04) and duration of symptoms (P <.001) are independent factors associated with testicular survival. Adjusted odds ratio was 1.0048 for a nonviable testis for every minute of delayed management in the ED (P = .04). Results suggest that every 10 minutes of delay in the ED increases the chance of having a nonviable testis in exploration by 4.8%. DTD is an independent factor predicting testicular survival. Institutional efforts should be made to decrease duration of DTD. DTD should be considered as a measure for quality of care."

    "abstract": "To define and measure complications across a broad set of acute pediatric conditions in emergency departments using administrative data, and to assess the validity of these definitions by comparing resource utilization between children with and without complications. Using local consensus, we predefined complications for 16 acute conditions including appendicitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, ovarian torsion, stroke, testicular torsion, and 11 others. We studied patients under age 18 years using 3 data years from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Statewide Databases of Maryland and New York. We measured complications by condition. Resource utilization was compared between patients with and without complications, including hospital length of stay, and charges. We analyzed 27 087 emergency department visits for a serious condition. The most common was appendicitis (n = 16 794), with 24.3% of cases complicated by 1 or more of perforation (24.1%), abscess drainage (2.8%), bowel resection (0.3%), or sepsis (0.9%). Sepsis had the highest mortality (5.0%). Children with complications had higher resource utilization: condition-specific length of stay was longer when complications were present, except ovarian and testicular torsion. Hospital charges were higher among children with complications (P < .05) for 15 of 16 conditions, with a difference in medians from $3108 (testicular torsion) to $13 7694 (stroke). Clinically meaningful complications were measurable and were associated with increased resource utilization. Complication rates determined using administrative data may be used to compare outcomes and improve healthcare delivery for children."

    "abstract": "We hypothesize that in testicular torsion, the duration of symptoms (DoS) better correlates with predicting testicular viability than minimizing the \"time-to-treat\" (TtT) after presentation to a medical facility. Medical records of male pediatric patients treated for suspected diagnosis of testicular torsion in the emergency department (ED) from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018, were retrospectively evaluated. Forty-one patients met inclusion criteria. Statistical analysis compared testicular viability based on TtT, DoS, and site of initial presentation. Testicular salvage rates for patients presenting directly to our ED was 56.3% with an average TtT of 2.5 h versus 77.8% and 1.96 h, respectively, for transferred patients. Overall testicular survival was not statistically impacted by the difference in TtT. Comparing DoS, an 84% testicular salvage rate (DoS < 24 h) versus a 15.4% salvage rate (DoS > 24 h) was shown in patients presenting directly to our ED (P ≤ 0.0001). Within the total population (n = 41), a significant difference was also shown (P ≤ 0.0001) when comparing overall testicular salvage rates in patients presenting with <24 h versus >24 h total DoS (84% versus 25%). These data reveal that an alternative predictor of testicular salvage rates is a DoS < 24 h. This is a meaningful metric when providing accurate preoperating counseling to parents and may be a better focus of quality improvement efforts surrounding this topic."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is an acute urological emergency that causes severe damage of testis. In order to prevent testicular damage, early diagnosis and surgical intervention is essential. Also pain management in both pre-operative and postoperative periods remains a challenging entity. In this study, we aimed to determine the possible positive effects of three different analgesics (ibuprofen, metamizole, and paracetamol), which are widely used in clinical practice on testicular tissue, in addition to pain control. Forty prepubertal rats (180-210 g) were divided into five experimental groups. Group 1 was sham group in which the left testis was brought out through a scrotal incision and then replaced in the scrotum without torsion. Group 2 was control group (only 0.9% NaCl was applied). Also in group 3, paracetamol, in group 4, ibuprofen, and in group 5, metamizole sodium was applied 1 h after the torsion. Torsion duration was planned as 4 h for all groups. In the biochemical evaluation, malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and total nitrate (NO) levels were measured in the testicular tissue. All groups were compared with group 2 (control group). In group 3, although the MDA level was lower and the MPO level was found to be higher, these were not statistically significant. In group 4, the NO level was low but statistically significant. Histological findings were evaluated due to Cosentino's classification, and the scores of group 4 were better than all groups. In this study, severe damage was observed at the end of torsion period of 4 h. This is in line with previous published data. The beneficial effects of all three drugs have been observed. Biochemical results did not clearly highlight any agents. According to pathology results, metamizole was better than paracetamol and the most ideal analgesic preparation was observed as ibuprofen."

    "abstract": "Torsion of an undescended testis is a surgical emergency whose frequency may be underestimated in the pediatric population. We describe this entity and focus on diagnostic challenges and optimal treatment of torsion of an undescended testis. We present a two-center retrospective chart review of patients with torsion of an undescended testis treated between 2013 and 2018. Two instructive cases are used to depict characteristics of this rare entity. We identified 11 patients with previously diagnosed cryptorchidism undergoing surgery for torsion of an undescended testis, accounting for 9.7% (11/107) of all testicular torsions in the period. Mean age at diagnosis was 9.4 months (1-22 months). Mean duration from onset of symptoms to presentation was 19.3 h (8-48 h). At admission to hospital 10 patients presented with groin lump (10/11, 90.9%) with or without pain leading to a suspected diagnosis of inguinal testicular torsion (5/11, 45.5%), incarcerated inguinal hernia (4/11, 36.4%) and epididymitis (1/11, 9.1%). Ten patients had an ultrasound examination before surgery leading to the correct diagnosis in six patients. Ultrasound findings were misinterpreted as incarcerated inguinal hernia in three patients. In eight patients the testis had to be removed at time of surgery; one of the three salvaged testes atrophied, resulting in a salvage rate of 18%. Torsion of an inguinal testis is not as rare as it might be presumed. Presentation of these patients is often deferred owing to equivocal signs and symptoms. In addition age at presentation differs from typical testicular torsion. As this might negatively influence testicular salvage rate, we advocate for special attention to this differential diagnosis in children with groin pathologies. Even if the child is not in pain, a tender groin in boys with undescended testes must prompt a quick and thorough examination to rule out torsion of an undescended testis. Ultrasound examination is of limited value and must not delay acute surgical treatment. IV."

    "abstract": "This single centre study retrospectively analysed the intraoperative findings relative to source of referral for emergency scrotal explorations performed in a tertiary level paediatric surgery department. All patients who underwent emergency scrotal exploration under the care of paediatric surgeons in our unit between April 2008 and April 2016 were identified. Clinical data were obtained from contemporaneous records. Over the 8-year study period, 662 boys underwent emergency scrotal exploration: 6 (1%) were internal referrals, 294 (44%) attended our emergency department (ED) directly, 271 (41%) were referred from primary care and 91 (14%) were transferred from other hospitals. Excluding procedures in neonates, testicular torsion was present in 100 cases (15%). Testicular detorsion with bilateral 3-point testicular fixation was performed in 66 (66%) and orchidectomy with contralateral fixation in 34 (34%) where the torted testis was non-viable intraoperatively. The orchidectomy rate in the presence of torsion was 23% in ED referrals (12/52), 43% in primary care referrals (12/28) and 50% for transfers (10/20). The difference in rates between ED referrals and patients transferred from other hospitals was significant (p=0.026). There was no significant difference in median age between any of the groups (p=0.10). Boys undergoing emergency scrotal exploration had a higher orchidectomy rate when transferred from other hospitals to our unit. This difference was statistically significant when compared with boys presenting directly to our ED. This supports advice from The Royal College of Surgeons of England for undertaking paediatric scrotal explorations in the presenting hospital when safe to do so rather than delaying the care of these patients by transferring them to a tertiary paediatric surgical unit."

This was a retrospective cohort study using prospectively collected data by the Canadian Institute of Health Information (CIHI) between 2010 and 2015. All Canadian male patients in the CIHI database aged <18 years with TT based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes were included, except for those residing in Quebec. Variables collected were age, type of treating institution (community small/medium, community large, or tertiary/academic), transfer for definitive treatment, road distance traveled, and ER throughput. The outcome was testicular loss based on intervention codes for orchiectomy/orchidopexy. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed using logistic regression. A total of 1713 minors with TT were included. Overall orchiectomy rate was 28%. Most patients (52%) were treated at tertiary hospitals. Small/medium community hospitals depicted the lowest odds of orchiectomy on univariable and multivariable analyses (odds ratio [OR] = 0.54, confidence interval [CI]: 0.37-0.79, p < 0.001); academic hospitals were also associated with a lower odds of orchiectomy than large community ones. Transfer and distance traveled were not associated with the outcome. Age >12 and ER throughput less than 1 h were significantly associated with lower orchiectomy rates. In a subgroup analysis of patients aged <12 years (n = 278), transfer was the only factor associated with increased risk of orchiectomy (OR = 2.41 , CI: 1.09-5.33; p = 0.03). This study showed that small and medium community hospitals had the lowest orchiectomy rates in minors with TT in Canada (Figure). However, on multivariable analysis, they performed similarly to tertiary/academic hospitals, with both being superior to large community hospitals. Transfer and distance traveled did not affect orchiectomy rates. Emergency room throughput had a statistically significant association with orchiectomy rates in every analysis and based on the study data would constitute the best target for policies aimed at reducing orchiectomy rates for TT in minors. The main limitation of this study is the inability to evaluate long-term testicular viability of patients not undergoing orchiectomy (i.e., true testicular salvage). Type of hospital treating facility (point-of-care) affects orchiectomy rates in minors with TT. Small/medium community hospitals depict the lowest orchiectomy rates in Canada. Transfer to another facility for definitive care and distance traveled did not affect orchiectomy rates, except in a subgroup analysis of prepubertal boys. Longer ER throughput and prepubertal age were consistently associated with loss of the testicle."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion (TT) is a urologic emergency that requires prompt surgical intervention. In rural Appalachia, patients are often transferred from surrounding communities due to lack of urologic care. We hypothesized that those transferred would have delayed intervention and higher rates of orchiectomy when compared to those who presented directly to our hospital. We performed a retrospective review of patient charts with an ICD-9 diagnosis of TT from 2008 to 2016. Patients met inclusion criteria if diagnosis was confirmed by operative exploration. We compared rate of testicular loss and time until surgical intervention between groups. Twenty-three patients met inclusion criteria (12 transferred, 11 direct). Patient demographics did not significantly differ between groups. Transferred patients had a higher orchiectomy rate (33% v 22%,p = 0.41) although this was not statistically significant. Time to surgery from symptom onset was significantly longer in those transferred (12.9 h) compared to those not transferred (6.9 h, p = 0.02). Distance of transfer was not correlated with time of delay (r2 = 0.063). Transferred patients with TT have numerically higher rates of orchiectomy which may reach significance in an appropriately powered study, and relative delays in surgical intervention. This study highlights the need for improved access to urologic care in rural areas."

    "abstract": "Torsion of the spermatic cord is a urological emergency that must be treated with acute surgery. Possible long-term effects of torsion on testicular function are controversial. This review aims to address the impact of testicular torsion (TT) on the endocrine- and exocrine-function of the testis, including possible negative effects of torsion on the function of the contralateral testis. Testis tissue survival after TT is dependent on the degree and duration of TT. TT has been demonstrated to cause long-term decrease in sperm motility and reduce overall sperm counts. Reduced semen quality might be caused by ischemic damage and reperfusion injury. In contrast, most studies find endocrine parameters to be unaffected after torsion, although few report minor alterations in levels of gonadotropins and testosterone. Contralateral damage after unilateral TT has been suggested by histological abnormalities in the contralateral testis after orchiectomy of the torsed testis. The evidence is, however, limited as most human studies are small case-series. Theories as to what causes contralateral damage mainly derive from animal studies making it difficult to interpret the results in a human context. Large long-term follow-up studies are needed to clearly uncover changes in testicular function after TT and to determine the clinical impact of such changes."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion (TT) is a common pediatric urologic emergency. Management of TT is time sensitive and often confirmed on scrotal Doppler ultrasound (DUS). Acquiring DUS, however, can result in delays in the management of TT, affecting testicular salvage rates. The objective of this study is to identify delays in the assessment and diagnosis for patients presenting with TT to a Canadian academic hospital using patient flow analysis. A retrospective review was performed for patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) who received a scrotal DUS to rule out possible TT between 2012 and 2017. The primary outcome measured cycle-time measurements (median time) between points along the clinical flow pathway for a patient with suspected TT. The secondary outcome assessed diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of standard scrotal DUS components (Doppler flow, arterial waveform, heterogeneous echotexture). A total of 609 patients presented with an acute scrotum warranting a scrotal DUS to rule out TT; of which, 46 underwent scrotal exploration. Testicular salvage rate was 82.6% in the series (38 testes salvaged, 8 required orchiectomy). Median time from symptom onset to ED presentation for patients with possible TT was 4 h. After triage, a median of 79.8 min was required for ED physician assessment and an additional 48 min for scrotal DUS to be performed. Absence of Doppler flow on scrotal DUS had a 97.4% PPV for diagnosing TT confirmed during scrotal exploration. Almost 4 h of in-ED time is required from triage to surgical intervention for potential TT at the institution. One area of delay is the time needed to conduct a scrotal DUS (48-128 min; Fig. 1). This represents an area of opportunity for patient flow optimization through the use of standardized clinical pathways and diagnostic adjuncts, such as point-of-care ultrasound. This study is limited in its retrospective nature and does not include patients with overt signs of TT who underwent surgical detorsion without need for scrotal DUS. Patient flow delays to surgical intervention for patients with TT represent a preventable cause of orchiectomy in young men. This study identifies intervention points in patient-care flow pathways where delays to surgical intervention can be potentially reduced by up to 2 h. The findings support the need for further studies into the optimization of patient flow and management protocols to reduce delays in the diagnosis and management of TT."

    "abstract": "To describe the correlation between acute scrotum pain and tension hydrocele, focusing on US and Doppler features. We evaluated retrospectively a series of five patients with a long history of hydrocele who were referred to our institutions for increasing acute scrotal pain. Patients were approached with gray scale US of both testes, as well as with color-Doppler and spectral analysis, comparing the results with those after aspiration and symptoms relief. All patients had a \"simple\" hydrocele with no internal septa; the involved testicles had a \"flattened\" appearance and parenchymal Doppler signals showed increased intratesticular vascular resistance. One patient had a low diastolic flow, compared to the contralateral testis, with an increased RI value, one had no diastolic flow, two patients had retrograde diastolic flow, and the remaining one had no intratesticular flow visible. After decompression, there were disappearance of pain and improved flow with normalization of testicular vascularity; post-ischemic hyperemia was appreciated in the two patients examined immediately after fluid aspiration, while normal flow was seen in three studies carried out the day after. To conclude, tension hydrocele is a rare condition that produces alterations of form and circulation of testicles, increase of intraparenchymal vascular resistances and strong and continuous pain, mimicking a testicular torsion. The increase in pressure produces an effect similar to that observed in a compartment syndrome. US findings, together with clinical assessment, indicate when emergency decompression may be appropriate to relieve testicular ischemia."

A quantitative, observational, cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2017 to September 2017 at our institution. The study target were parents attending the pediatric urology clinic and the comparison group included parents attending the general pediatric clinic in the same period. We distributed a questionnaire and then compared the results in both groups. A total of 200 parents participated in this study (100 parents from each clinic). Nineteen percent of pediatric urology clinic parents were aware and 14% of general pediatric clinic parents were aware about TT with no statistically significant difference observed (P = 0.341). The parents in urology clinic choose doctor as their main source of knowledge (42.1%), while in general pediatric clinic, doctor and through a friend as the main source of knowledge had the same percentage (28.6%). Response of the parents to their children's scrotal pain during working hours in urology and general pediatric clinics was to drive their children to the emergency room immediately with 85% and 82%, respectively. The response of the parents after working hours in both clinics did not show difference, with 83% of parents in pediatric urology clinic and 85% in general pediatric clinic driving their children immediately to the emergency room. TT in boys is a common problem we face as pediatric urologists and it may lead to testicular loss if not diagnosed and treated early. We found that the awareness of TT in children is low in our community and it is our responsibility to raise it to improve our children's well-being."

Mean age was 12 years (Range: 10-13 years) and time from onset of pain was 5.25 hours (±4,2). Left testicle was affected in 75% (n=12). Detorsion maneuver was performed by a pediatric surgeon at the radiology room, in counter-clockwise direction in the right testicle and clockwise direction in the left testicle in all cases. The success was defined as the relief of pain, normal physical examination and was confirmed by Doppler ultrasound performed immediately after MD. MD was effective in 75% (n=12) and orchiopexy was performed under elective conditions at median time of 2 weeks (0-5 weeks). MD was unsuccessful in 3 patients and emergency orchiopexy was performed with no testicular loss. 1 patient had a second MD maneuver for incomplete detorsion.

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a urological emergency; as the testicular salvage rate decreases with time, prompt intervention is required to restore the blood flow. Interhospital transfers and ultrasound examinations, while clinically essential to proper treatment and diagnosis, may adversely affect outcomes by delaying surgical intervention. Patients transferred to another institution for treatment of testicular torsion may experience a further time delay by undergoing two ultrasound examinations: one at the initial admitting institution and one at the receiving institution. To the knowledge of the authors, no study has yet explored the time delays and outcomes associated with these repeat ultrasounds. The objective was to investigate the impact of repeat ultrasound imaging on time to treatment and patient outcomes in patients with testicular torsion. A retrospective chart review of 133 patients, aged 0-20 years, treated at the authors' institution for testicular torsion was conducted. Neonate patients and patients who did not receive ultrasound were excluded. Demographic and clinical variables were collected from the electronic medical record. Pearson Chi-squared and t-tests were used for univariate comparisons, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to measure the relationships between variables. Forty-nine percent of patients were primary patients, and 51% were transfer patients. Fifty-two percent of transfer patients received repeat ultrasounds. In comparison to salvaged patients, those who underwent orchiectomy experienced a greater delay between presentation at the institution and surgical intervention (229 min vs 177 min, p = 0.048). The transfer status does not appear to be related to the outcome, i.e. orchiectomy versus salvage. Patients who underwent orchiectomy were more likely than salvaged patients to have received repeat ultrasounds (p = 0.008). Repeat ultrasound patients had three times the likelihood of orchiectomy of single ultrasound patients. In a subset analysis of transfer patients, repeat ultrasound patients were more likely than single ultrasound patients to receive an orchiectomy (p = 0.03). In agreement with previous studies, patients who underwent orchiectomy were found to experience greater treatment delays and trend toward transfer. Specifically, repeat ultrasound and time between presentation and intervention appear to influence patient outcomes. The effect of repeat ultrasound on outcomes appears to be independent of the transfer status. The study was limited by its retrospective nature and small sample size. The analysis suggests that efforts to prevent repeat ultrasounds and minimize the time between presentation and intervention would improve patient outcomes. It is proposed that standardized clinical decision-making procedures, such as the TWIST scoring system, be incorporated into hospital protocols."

Patients were included if they had received the diagnosis after a clinical evaluation in the emergency department and had subsequently undergone antibiotic treatment and a follow-up scrotal ultrasound at a later date. Overall, 118 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The median age was 45 years (range = 18-80). The follow-up ultrasound scans showed no signs of significant pathology in 92/118. Incidental findings of hydroceles, spermatoceles, and varicoceles were made in eight, five and five of the 118, respectively. One patient had testicular tuberculosis and one had neglected testicular torsion. Six patients were diagnosed with suspicious testicular lesions and underwent surgery. Cancer was confirmed in four men (27, 32, 40, and 45 years old). Epididymitis can be diagnosed and treated correctly without scrotal ultrasound in the majority of cases. However, the risk of underlying testicular cancer should be kept in mind. Patients below 50 years of age without bacteriuria and patients with persistent symptoms after antibiotic treatment should be referred to an urologist for a re-evaluation or for a follow-up ultrasound."

We thus investigated the clinical implications of systemic inflammatory responses (SIRs) as potential surrogates of SD to improve testis survival. Sixty men with TT that underwent immediate operation among orchiectomy and orchiopexy following a visit to a single emergency department were retrospectively enrolled. Mandatory laboratory tests conducted included neutrophil, lymphocyte, and platelet counts. Mean age and SD was 15.7±3.7 years and 8.27±4.98 hours, respectively. Thirty-eight (63.3%) underwent orchiectomy and the remaining 22 underwent orchiopexy. Leukocytosis (p=0.001) and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR, p<0.001) were significantly lower in the orchiopexy group as was SD (3.27±1.88 vs. 11.16±3.80, p<0.001). Although multivariate model showed that the only single variable associated with receipt of orchiopexy was SD (odds ratio [OR]=0.259, p<0.001), it also revealed NLR as a sole SIR associated with SD (B=0.894, p<0.001). While 93.3% with a SD of within 3 hours underwent orchiopexy, only 26.6% of affected testes were preserved between 3 to 12 hours (n=30). When multivariable analysis was applied to those with window period, NLR alone predicted orchiopexy rather than orchiectomy (p=0.034, OR=0.635, p=0.013). The area under curve between SD (0.882) and NLR (0.756) was similar (p=0.14). This study showed NLR independently predicted testis survival by proper surgical correction particularly for patients with marginally delayed diagnosis, which suggest the clinical usefulness for identifying candidates for orchiopexy in emergency setting."

    "title": "Suspected testicular torsion in children: diagnostic dilemma and recommendation for a lower threshold for initiation of surgical exploration.",
    "abstract": "Testicular torsion (TT) represents a clinical challenge that needs emergency surgical assessment. It is common to have negative scrotal exploration due to confounding symptoms and signs which makes it sometimes difficult to differentiate from similar surgical emergencies that do not warrant surgery. At the same time, several occasions of misdiagnoses or late interventions occur with devastating effects. We aim at delineating the significance of the different clinical, laboratory, and radiological variables in the detection of TT. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 52 patients who were surgically explored with a preoperative working diagnosis of suspected TT in our center over the period from 2011 to 2015. All the patients were examined by pediatric surgeons in the emergency room and had undergone ultrasound imaging of the testes. The ultrasound images were retrospectively reviewed by a pediatric radiologist who was blinded to the intraoperative findings. Univariate and multivariate and logistic regression analyses were performed. Of the studied group of patients, the majority (84.6%) had TT upon surgical exploration. The most frequently presented symptom was pain (80.8%), and only a minority (11.5%) presented with vomiting. Radiological findings with the highest sensitivity were heterogeneous echogenicity in favor of TT and enlarged epididymis indicating that TT is unlikely. However, the predictability of TT by any of the assessed clinical and imaging factors was statistically insignificant. It is important to gather all relevant data from clinical, laboratory, and imaging sources when assessing pediatric patients with suspected TT given the inaccuracy of each single one of them if used alone. Keeping this in mind, Doppler ultrasound has a significant role to aid in the accuracy of the diagnosis and hence the appropriate decision-making thereafter. However, we found no single clinical or imaging sign that is sensitive enough to prove or rule out TT. Therefore, surgical exploration should take place in a timely manner. Moreover, further research is necessary to construct scoring systems where different predictors collectively have higher reliability."

    "abstract": "Perinatal testicular torsion is a relatively rare event that remains unidentified in many situations and managed only after an avoidable delay of time. Its current management approaches include watchful observation, delayed contralateral orchiopexy, and emergent contralateral orchiopexy. On the other hand, bilateral torsion is now being more frequently reported. However, the assessment of the contralateral testis through physical examination and imaging can be inaccurate in cases of perinatal torsion. We report a case of prenatal testicular torsion with incidentally discovered metachronous contralateral extravaginal testicular torsion. Therefore, immediate surgical intervention is recommended both when uni- or bilateral testicular torsion is suspected. Whenever possible, affected testes should be preserved as some endocrine function may be retained."

    "title": "Remote ischemic conditioning in a rat model of testicular torsion: does it offer testicular protection?",
    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency mainly affecting adolescent boys, with a relatively high rate of missed torsion and testicular loss secondary to delay in prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention. With ischemic reperfusion injury as its underlying culprit, testicular torsion may respond favorably to remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) where a non-privileged site (e.g. limb) is concurrently rendered ischemic to divert the cascade of reperfusion injury from the privileged organ (e.g. testicle), thus offering a protective effect in improving salvage. This mechanism is established for other organs, whereas it has not been evaluated for testis. It was aimed to evaluate RIC in a rat model of testicular torsion as a proof of principle that, similar to what has been demonstrated in other organs, RIC does offer testicular protection. This is an animal experimental study. Thirty Sprague-Dawley male rats were divided into control group (n = 15) and experimental group (n = 15). Non-survival surgeries of right-sided spermatic cord torsion (720° counter-clockwise twist) were performed for both the groups (45 min) followed by detorsion and reperfusion (5 min) and then orchiectomy. For the experiment group, an intervention of tail clamping to create RIC was applied 5 min after torsion, then unclamping 5 min before detorsion, followed by detorsion and reperfusion for 5 min and then orchiectomy. The testicles were histologically and immunologically examined using a hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1α) ELISA Kit. The histological findings on ischemic changes, vascular congestion, and immunohistochemistry were quantified using previously described, validated grading systems. DISCUSSION: This is the first study to demonstrate the concept of RIC in an animal model of testicular torsion. It is limited by the non-availability of similar studies to compare outcomes and by the caution of extrapolating animal studies on humans. It does lay grounds, however, to subsequent studies to further elaborate on this concept and its clinical applicability. When RIC is applied in the experimental setting of testicular torsion, there is less evidence of hypoxic injury by histology and immunohistochemistry."

    "abstract": "In this article, we present two medicolegal cases illustrating medical and diagnostic pitfalls that can lead to litigation for missed testicular torsion. Testicular torsion (TT) is a urologic emergency with potentially devastating consequences and costs, for providers and patients alike. TT occurs in approximately 4.5 per 100,000 males under the age of 25. While uncommon, TT is the third most common cause of medical malpractice suits in this demographic. As a consequence of varying presentations and physical exam findings, and diagnostic imaging subject to individual interpretation, this time-sensitive diagnosis may be missed by emergency department providers. Delays in diagnosis significantly increases the morbidity associated with TT, and 31.9%-41.9% of such cases result in testicular loss. The average reported settlement for TT malpractice litigation is $60,000. This article discusses two actual malpractice cases involving TT and provides insight and caveats to ensure an optimal evaluation and diagnostic approach to this often-elusive condition."

    "abstract": "To investigate the clinical features, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of children with cryptorchidism complicated by testicular torsion. The clinical data of 6 children with cryptorchidism complicated by testicular torsion admitted to our hospital from December 2000 to December 2016 were analyzed retrospectively. All 6 children were diagnosed with cryptorchidism by surgery, their age was from 12 days up to 11 years, and the average time between onset of symptoms and diagnosis was 20.5 h. Torsion testis was located in the groin area and the rate of left to right was about 2:1. Twist was 600° on average. All children were admitted because of the inconsolable cry, abdominal pain, and the swelling of the groin. Three patients underwent orchidectomy, while the other 3 patients underwent detorsion and cryptorchidopexy. Color Doppler ultrasound examination showed normal testes at 6 months after operation. Only 1 case was diagnosed with cryptorchidism after birth. Cryptorchidism is an emergency in pediatric urology and often leads to a low testicular salvage rate, especially in infants, due to lack of knowledge, delayed diagnosis, and late treatment. Neonatal genital examination is important for the early diagnosis and management of cryptorchidism."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion, a common urologic emergency, is primarily caused by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury of the testis. Nitric oxide (NO)-derived from nitrite (NO 2- ) has been reported to have prominent therapeutic effects on I/R injury in the heart, liver, and brain; however, its effects on testicular I/R injury have not been evaluated. This study, therefore, investigated whether NO from NO 2- is beneficial in a rat model of testicular I/R injury which eventually results in impaired spermatogenesis. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to the following seven groups: group A, sham-operated control group; Group B, I/R with no treatment; Groups C, D, and E, I/R followed by treatment with three different doses of NO 2- ; Group F, I/R followed by administration of NO 2- and NO scavenger (2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide potassium salt [C-PTIO]); and Group G, I/R followed by administration of nitrate (NO 3- ). NO 2- , NO 3- , and C-PTIO were intravenously administered. Histological examination of the testes and the western blot analysis of caspase-3 were performed. Levels of antioxidant enzymes and lipid peroxidation were measured. Germ cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, antioxidant enzymatic function, and lipid peroxidation in Group B were significantly higher than those in Group A. Group B exhibited an abnormal testicular morphology and impaired spermatogenesis. In contrast, testicular damages were attenuated in the NO 2- treatment groups, which were caused by reduction in superoxide and peroxynitrite levels and an inhibition of caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. The results of this study suggest NO 2- to be a promising therapeutic agent with anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic properties in testicular I/R injury."

A Bolivian 16 year old male with acquired cerebropalsy and spastic neuromuscular disease was admitted to our Institute for a right inguinal swelling observed by the father in the morning. Indeed, the father had reported that the swelling had may be started two days before without pain or any other symptoms apparently. Two episodes of vomiting were only reported. At the general examination the patient, apparently, seemed to laugh repeatedly and a spastic movements increase were observed. The child had an infrainguinal bilateral cryptorchidism. An urgent left infrainguinal orchyectomy had been performed in the past and controlateral cryptorchidism was not corrected. At the right inguinal exploration, a complete twist of the spermatic chord was observed and a right orchyectomy was then performed. Testicular torsion in the inguinal canal is a rare reported condition that usually can involve patients with spastic neuromuscular disease. Processing, communication and verbalization of a chronic or acute pain seems to be different in a child with or without intellectual disability. It could be a lot more difficult to correct pain interpretation, with an important repercussion on pain accurate assessment and management. In the patients with intellectual disability, a control of the testicles, it should always be done, mostly in case of atypical behaviour."

However, it is not known to what extent spermatogenic function is preserved in these testes. The purpose of the study was to demonstrate the prognostic value of thiol/disulphide homeostasis in rats for testicular ischaemia and ischaemia-reperfusion injury during early and late stages. A total of 21 Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into three groups. The 4 and 8-hr T/D (torsion/detorsion) groups were subjected to left testicular torsion by twisting the testes by 720° counterclockwise direction. The 2 cc venous blood samples were also collected from the 4 and 8-hr T/D groups after 4 and 8 hr respectively. It was determined that the native thiol, total thiol and disulphide values of 4 and 8-hr T/D group before detorsion were significantly lower than those of the sham group (p: 0.006; p: 0.003; p: 0.003). In the 8-hr T/D group, there was a positive statistically significant relationship at an 88.3% level between Johnsen's score and total thiol values before detorsion (p: 0.008). Our study showed that thiol/disulphide homeostasis may be a haematologic parameter in predicting testicular ischaemia and histopathologic injury in the testes following ischaemia-reperfusion."

Reviewed all English-language articles published between 2005 and 2015 in Medline/Pubmed that had a defined diagnosis of NTT within the first thirty days of life, and discussed specific surgical and nonsurgical management. Exclusion criteria were non-English literature, case reports, case studies, and failure to clearly describe the management of NTT. Data from 9 studies were analyzed, individually and together as pooled data, using a random effect model with a random intercept to estimate the pooled proportions of interest. Results are presented with 95% confidence interval. All analyses were done in SAS 9.4®. 9 publications met criteria for this analysis with a total of 196 patients. Bilateral testicular torsions (n = 14) were less common as compared to right/left testicular torsion (n = 85/97). Asynchronous NTTs (n = 9) were more common than synchronous NTTs (n = 2). There was a higher incidence of NTT in neonates delivered by vaginal delivery (n = 110) as compared to those delivered by c-section (n = 25). Extravaginal torsion (n = 54) is far more common than intravaginal torsion (n = 2). Full-term neonates (n = 122) have a higher incidence of NTT as compared to preterm neonates (n = 9). A total of 15 testicles were salvaged. Of the salvaged testicles 2 were documented as prenatal, 10 postnatal and 3 were undocumented. A strategy of bilateral exploration allows for salvage of about 7% of ipsilateral testicles and prevent asynchronous torsion in about 4% of neonates. Based on our population, between 8-12% of patients would benefit from bilateral exploration at the time of diagnosis. We recommend urgent bilateral exploration with orchiopexy of the contralateral testicle in order to avert anorchia. Systematic review.

Testicular hemangioma is exceedingly rare and typically occurs in patients younger than 20 years, the age in which a primary germ cell tumor of the testis may present, necessitating a radical approach to management with orchidectomy, although potential conservative focal partial surgical excision is desirable. Hemangiomas of the testis have a similar sonographic and magnetic resonance imaging appearance to that of malignant tumors of the testis, especially seminoma. The work has been reported in line with the SCARE criteria. We present a case of testicular torsion in a 15-year-old male patient who had a painful left testis for 6 days, no vomiting, no fever or dysuria. With clinical suspicion of an old testicular torsion the patient was examined by ultrasound which confirmed the clinical diagnosis. The patient underwent emergency surgical exploration. The left testis was found to be necrotic after a 360° testicular torsion and an orchiectomy was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient was discharged on day 4 after surgery. Histology showed a complete ischemic infarction of the testicular parenchyma as part of a ruptured intratesticular cavernous hemangioma. Cavernous hemangioma is a rare tumor of the testicle in either childhood or adult period. The particularity of the presented case is the possible association of a cavernous intratesticular hemangioma with the torsion of the testis in a teenager. Clinicians and pathologists must be aware of the rare entity of testicular hemangiomas, as clinical examination and imaging studies do not often suffice to arrive at a correct diagnosis."

With the hematoma spreading to the scrotum, the testes became inverted and dislocated to the inguinal region on both sides. Without surgery or interventions, the testes descended into the scrotum on the third day after the injury before fibrillation and scarring began. Testicular dislocation by injury is rare and encountered exclusively in children. It is generally treated with surgery to retain testicular function. We selected conservative management, as our patient had a closed injury without testicular torsion, and the testicular dislocation was associated with compression by hematoma, which could possibly recover with regression of the hematoma."

Varicocele thromboses can occur post operatively or spontaneously. Five cases of post-operative and five cases of spontaneous thromboses have been described till date. The traditional advice in the management of thrombosed varicocele has been to manage it conservatively in all patients by drugs and scrotal support with little description of the surgical treatment. Herein, we present an unusual sixth case of spontaneous thromboses of varicocele and discuss its presentation and surgical management. We would also like to highlight the differentiating points between spontaneous thrombosis and post operative in vitro clot formation in the varicoceles, as these two entities can often be confused for each other. A 68 year-old man presented with excruciating scrotal pain of one week duration. Doppler study of scrotum revealed left varicocele with no evidence of Epididymo-orchitis. He was treated with intravenous antibiotics, analgesics and scrotal elevation. He had no relief and continued to have severe pain. Clinical examination was normal. Patient underwent exploratory surgery on a semi- emergent basis. Exploration revealed normal testis with thrombosed varicoceles. Patient underwent Varicocelectomy. Postoperatively patient had immediate pain relief. Histopathology revealed prominent thrombosed varicocele. A varicocelectomy specimen (done for primary infertility) was used for comparison. The differentiating points between the two entities were noted. Spontaneous thrombosis of varicocele is a rare cause of acute scrotal pain. Pain out of proportion to clinical features is characteristic. Patients not responding to medical therapy may need varicocelectomy. Varicocelectomy may give immediate relief.

However, diagnosis in females is often delayed owing to nonspecific symptoms. We sought to assess disparities in management and outcomes between males and females with torsion. The National Inpatient Sample was queried for pediatric patients with \"emergent\", \"urgent\", or \"trauma center\" admission and ICD-9 codes for ovarian torsion and testicular torsion. Demographic data, operative procedure, gonadal loss, length of stay (LOS), total charges (TC), and mortality were recorded. There were 2254 unweighted encounters. The average age was 11.56±5.30years for males and 12.55±3.72years for females (p<0.001). Among males, 90% underwent surgery (p<0.001), of which 40% required orchiectomy. Conversely, 73% of females had surgery (p<0.001), of which 78% had oophorectomy. Subsequent analysis with only patients who underwent surgery showed that insurance status (p=0.012), race (p<0.001), and U.S. region (p<0.001) were significantly different between males and females. Gender specific analyses showed that hospital control, hospital location/teaching status, and treatment year were also significant. As such, these six factors in addition to age and gender were used for propensity score matching (PSM). PSM produced two gender cohorts of 755 encounters each. Females had longer LOS (2.44±1.84days vs. 1.28±2.27days for males, p<0.001) and had higher TC ($20,058.44±13,420.82) compared to males ($12,386.58±12,793.34), p<0.001. Logistic regression revealed that males (OR 0.163 [0.130-0.206]) and older patients (age OR 0.924 [0.903-0.946]) were less likely to undergo gonadal loss. Compared to those with private insurance, those with Medicare/Medicaid were more likely to have gonadal loss (1.401 [1.101-1.783]). Disparities exist in the management of torsion based on gender. Overall, females had higher charges, had longer hospitalization, and were more likely to have gonadal loss despite current data supporting gonadal preservation for nearly all cases of ovarian torsion.

Responses were anonymously submitted, blindly reviewed, and analyzed. Among 53 respondents, 62.3% had academic appointments and 73.6% had an exclusive pediatric urology practice. All participants agreed on CTF necessity in testicular torsion beyond the neonatal period. CTF was advocated by 84.9% in prenatal torsion, 96.2% in postnatal torsion, and 94.3% in delayed torsion presentation. Emergent intervention was favored by 64.4% in prenatal and 98% in postnatal torsion. Only 1 participant (1.9%) preferred CTF with a unilateral testicular tumor and 5 (9.4%) in trauma substantiating an orchiectomy. There was less consensus on CTF in torsed undescended testis (79.3% in prepubertal and 81.13% in postpubertal), testicular nubbin in a child (40.4%), palpable atrophic undescended testis (13.2%), and unilateral bell-clapper anomaly (47.2%). In situations other than torsion, lack of strong evidence was the commonest reason not to perform CTF. The majority of responding pediatric urologists currently performs CTF in neonatal torsion. Although there is a general consensus on CTF in testicular torsion outside the neonatal period, CTF remains controversial in other clinical situations, warranting further research.

Over half (58.4%; 257/440) of the patients were diagnosed with genital/paragenital infection, 11.8% (52/440) with chronic testicular pain, 9.5% (42/440) with acute testicular torsion, 4.3% (19/440) with a testicular cancer, and 2.5% (11/440) with symptomatic distal ureterolithiasis. In multivariate analysis, a positive Prehn's sign was predictive of testicular torsion, whereas fever, dysuria, high leucocyte counts in blood and/or urine, high blood C-reactive protein, and burning pain were predictive of genital/paragenital infection. Color Doppler ultrasound did not help to distinguish between torsion and infection. An accurate diagnostic pathway helps to correctly distinguish between the possible causes of acute scrotum. However, none of the examinations performed could reliably distinguish between acute torsion and other causes of acute scrotum. Therefore, immediate surgical exploration of the testis is mandatory if torsion cannot be ruled out."

    "abstract": "Acute scrotum, especially testicular torsion, is a common surgical emergency. A delay in diagnosis or management may lead to permanent testicular ischaemic damage. Thus, it is particularly important to differentiate testicular torsion from other acute scrotum conditions as soon as possible. Our study has retrospectively investigated 358 patients with acute scrotum admitted to our hospital from the year 2007 to 2016. We have collected a thorough history and clinical data and drew the conclusion by comparing clinical features of different acute scrotum cases, medical history, imaging and surgical findings. Therefore, we propose an innovative \"Testicular Torsion (TT) Green Channel\" concept. Through the combination of a comprehensive medical history, physical examination and auxiliary colour-Doppler ultrasonography, the diagnosis of testicular torsion is definite in most circumstances. Testis scintigraphy is a novel and complementary diagnostic modality that can reduce the negative exploration rate in ambiguous and certain cases. The TT Green Channel is a new concept in the management of testicular torsion."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a urological emergency. If not recognized in time, this condition may result in ischaemic injury and loss of testis. Simultaneous bilateral neonatal testicular torsion is extremely rare and is usually misdiagnosed. We report a case of a male newborn, who presented with bilateral scrotal swelling and redness of the scrotum. Doppler ultrasound supported the diagnosis of bilateral testicular torsion, with an absent blood flow signal on the right side and a weak signal on the left side. Testicular exploration through scrotal incision was performed and bilateral testicular torsion was found. Right testis was grossly gangrenous, and right orchiectomy was performed. Left testicle was dark but showed recovery after detorsion with some bleeding from incised tunica albugenia. Fixation of the left testicle was performed. At six month follow-up, the left testis showed signs of atrophy and hormonal assay showed very low testosterone and elevated LH and FSH, suggesting hypogonadism. Management of neonatal testicular torsion is a matter of controversy. Testicular torsion results into acute ischemia and urgent surgical exploration is the key point of management. Although the possibility of salvaging the involved testicles is usually very low it is hard to justify a passive approach to a bilateral torsion resulting in such a devastating condition as anorchia."

Color Doppler is considered investigation of choice, but it may delay treatment, as, many times, it may not be available for emergency situations. Barbosa et al. created Testicular Workup for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion (TWIST) score based on clinical parameters for clinical diagnosis of testicular torsion. We have evaluated this score in our population. We retrospectively calculated TWIST score in patients of acute scrotum admitted to tertiary teaching institute. Patients without complete TWIST score were excluded from the study. The scoring system consisted of testicular swelling (2 points), hard testicle (2), absent cremasteric reflex (1), nausea/vomiting (1), and high-riding testis (1). Statistical analysis was done to evaluate the validity of scores. A total of 118 patients were included in the study, out of which 45 (38%) patients had testicular torsion. The mean age of patients was 16.6 years in testicular torsion patients and 15.2 years in other patients. Cutoff for low-risk and high-risk patients was two and five, respectively. Fifty percent, 26.2%, and 23.8% of patients were present in low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups. Negative predictive value of TWIST score for low-risk patients was 96.61% while positive predictive value for high-risk patients was 92.86%. TWIST score has high predictive value and can be used for clinical diagnosis of testicular torsion. It can decrease the need of color Doppler in about 50% of cases and can prevent delay in treatment."

At surgical exploration, the spermatic cord is seen twisted a variable number of times around its longitudinal axis. There is scant data regarding the degree of twisting and its association with testis outcomes. The purpose of our study is to explore how the degree of torsion factors into testicular outcome using follow-up data. We retrospectively reviewed the records of adolescent males who presented with testicular torsion to our institution, looking at duration of pain symptoms, degree of torsion documented in the operative note, procedure performed (orchiopexy versus orchiectomy), and follow-up clinic data for whether testicular atrophy after orchiopexy was present. A non-salvageable testis was defined as orchiectomy or atrophy. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC), multivariate, and logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the probability of a non-salvageable torsed testis based on time and degree of twisting. Eighty-one patients met our study criteria, with 55 testes deemed viable and 26 non-salvageable. We found a 25.7% atrophy rate after orchiopexy. Cut-off values of 8.5 h and 495 degrees of torsion would provide sensitivities of 73% and 53%, respectively, with specificity of 80% for both. Only duration and age were correlated with the risk of non-salvage on multivariate analysis. Logistic regression generated linear probability formulas of 4 + (3 ¡Á hours) and 7 + (0.05 ¡Á degrees) in calculating the probability of non-salvage with strong correlation. We were able to derive separate formulas to determine the viability of the torsed testis based on symptom duration and degrees of twisting. Fifteen h of symptoms and 860 degrees of torsion gives testes a 50% salvage rate. Interestingly, we also found that about 1 out of every 4 testes undergoes atrophy after orchiopexy."

The objective of this review was to assess the validity and accuracy of this sign by performing a comprehensive systematic literature review and meta-analysis. In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was performed (August, 2017), using the following databases: BMJ Best Practice, Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Selected studies were further assessed for relevance and quality using the Oxford 2010 Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP). Of the studies assessed, a total of 723 participants were included, with a mean of 72.3 (SD 71.9) participants. Of the participants, 226 (31.3%) were diagnosed with testicular torsion (TT). Meta-analysis of the studies that provided sufficient data resulted in a pooled sensitivity and specificity of the WS of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.65-0.79) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.92-0.99), respectively. Removal of all neonates increased the pooled sensitivity to 0.92 (95% CI, 0.70-0.98) while the pooled specificity remained almost unchanged at 0.99 (95% CI, 0.95-1.00). The estimated summary effect of all studies with sufficient data was 4.34 (95% CI, 1.01-7.67; n = 394; p = 0.001). A large degree of heterogeneity was suggested by an I2 statistic of 88.27% (95% CI, 68.60-98.68%). Removal of neonatal subjects increased the estimated summary effect to 5.32 (95% CI, 1.59-9.05; n = 375; p = 0.001). The WS, when correctly diagnosed, may be viewed as a very definitive sign for TT in the pediatric and adult populations. However, its role in neonates is limited."

In this study, we explored the protective influence of rosiglitazone on testicular ischaemia-reperfusion damage. There were 28 male Sprague Dawley rats in total, which were assigned randomly to four groups. Group A was blank control one; group B was testicular injury one; group C was rosiglitazone one; group D was rosiglitazone antagonist one. The testicles were counter-rotated after 2 hr and then underwent orchiectomy 24 hr later. We found that testicular tissue structure of rats was seriously damaged in groups B and D. However, group C had better testicular architecture. Similar findings were also shown for lipid peroxidation by evaluating the MDA activity (p < .05). Unlike group B or group D, the levels of inflammation by evaluating the MPO activity, the levels of TNF-a, IL-1 and IL-6 and the expressions of ICAM-1 were prominently lower in group C (p < .05) as well. So our researches demonstrated that rosiglitazone significantly decreased the amount of responsive oxygen radical and regulated inflammatory responses. Rosiglitazone had a protective influence against testicular ischaemia-reperfusion injury in rats and possibly depended on its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant traits."

Medical records were used to retrospectively investigate the final diagnoses including testicular torsion (TT), torsion of the testicular appendage, epididymitis, orchitis, incarcerated inguinal hernia, idiopathic scrotal edema, Schönlein-Henoch purpura, hydrocele, external trauma, as well as those with no confirmed diagnosis. (Results) A total of 257 patients presented with acute scrotum at the emergency outpatient unit. The patients had an average age of 6.7 years, with symptoms present on the right side in 120 cases (47%), left side in 108 cases (42%), and both sides in 29 cases (11%). Observing the frequency of each condition, TT was present in 33 cases (13%), torsion of the testicular appendage in eight cases (3%), epididymitis in 85 cases (33%), orchitis in four cases (2%), incarcerated inguinal hernia in 59 cases (23%), idiopathic scrotal edema in six cases (2%), Schönlein-Henoch purpura in nine cases (4%), hydrocele in 10 patients (4%), external trauma in 12 patients (5%), and unconfirmed diagnosis in 31 cases (12%). Average time between onset and presentation at the ER was 0.6 days for TT, with patients having previously been examined at other hospitals before coming to this institution in 12 cases (36%). Emergency urological surgery was performed in 31 cases (12%), with TT comprising 28 cases (90%), and orchiectomy performed in six cases (21%). (Conclusion) Of all patients examined for acute scrotum, epididymitis were high and TT in 13% at the pediatric ER. Average time for TT patients from symptom onset to ER presentation were longer, we must ensure that patients present at earliest possible opportunity requires educating the general population."

The case records of 13 patients operated for testicular torsion involving undescended testis were retrospectively reviewed. The medical records included age at presentation, medical history, physical examination, operative findings and the results of follow-up. The diagnosis of torsion of undescended testis was made clinically and confirmed by inguinal exploration. In six cases the testis was preserved and orchiopexy was performed, while in seven cases orchidectomy was performed due to testicular gangrene in six patients and testicular tumor discovered peroperatively in one case. Mean duration of symptoms at time of surgery in the orchiopexy group was 6.5 h and in the orchidectomy group was 21.2 h. From six patients treated by orchiopexy, two patients suffered from testicular atrophy at a mean of 24 months. Testicular torsion in undescended testis is still diagnosed with delay which may affect testicular salvage. The importance of examination of external genital organs is highlighted which should be routinely included by emergency physicians in physical examination for abdominal or groin pain."

    "abstract": "Testis torsion is a surgical emergency, and sometimes we cannot sufficiently prevent injury even surgical detorsion of the testis is performed in the appropriate time period due to some reasons such as tissue edema. In this experimental study, we investigated the effect of tunica albuginea incision (TAI) on testicular torsion-detorsion model (TDM). Twenty four male rats were used. The rats were randomly divided into three groups. In Group I, testicular torsion (TT) of 720° was created. After 4 hours of torsion period, the testis was detorsioned. Then three longitudinal incisions were made on tunica albuginea of the testis. In Group II, torsion and detorsion was created by the same way as in Group I, but TAI was not added to the procedure. Group III was Sham group. At the end of the first week, rats in the experimental groups were sacrificed and the testes were harvested for histological, immunohistological examinations and for the assessment of apoptotic activity. In Group I, the procedures led to partial improvement in color of the testes. Modified Johnsen Scores in Groups I, II and III were detected as 7.8, 4.3 and 9.6 respectively (P = .001). In Group I, immunoreactivity of anti-APAF-1 was moderate in 7 rats, and strong in 1 rat. Immunoreactivity of anti-cytochrome C and anti-caspase3 were moderate in 6 rats, and strong in 2 rats. Immunoreactivity of anti-caspase 8 and 9 were moderate in 5 rats, and strong in 3 rats. The differences of immunoreactivity between the groups were statistically significant. TUNEL percentages were detected as 40, 62% in Group I, 60% in Group II and 11,75% in Group III respectively (P = .001). As a result, multiple incisions made on tunica albuginea after detorsion in the TDM in rats, decrease the amount of ischemia- reperfusion injury. This effect might be related with the decrease in testicular edema and free oxygen radicals together with increase in tissue perfusion. Moreover, the decreased apoptotic activity seems to play a role in the decrease in inflammatory response and preservation of tissue parenchyma consequently."

Demographics, arrival to incision time, hospital cost in dollars, and testicular outcome (determined by testicular ultrasound) at follow-up were retrospectively compared in all patients transferred to our tertiary care children's hospital with a diagnosis of testicular torsion from 2012 to 2016. Clinical data for STOR and non-STOR patients were compared by Wilcoxon rank-sum, 2-tailed t test, or Fisher exact test as appropriate. Sixty-eight patients met inclusion criteria: 35 STOR and 33 non-STOR. Children taken STOR had a shorter median arrival to incision time (STOR: 54 minutes vs non-STOR: 94 minutes, P  < .0001) and lower median total hospital costs (STOR: $3882 vs non-STOR: $4419, P < .0001). However, only 46.8% of STOR patients and 48.4% of non-STOR patients achieved surgery within 6 hours of symptom onset. Testicular salvage rates in STOR and non-STOR patients were not significantly different (STOR: 68.4% vs non-STOR: 36.8%, P = .1), but follow-up was poor. STOR decreased arrival to incision time and hospital cost but did not affect testicular loss. The bulk of ischemia time in torsion transfers occurred before arrival at our tertiary care center. Further interventions addressing delays in diagnosis and transfer are needed to truly improve testicular salvage rates in these patients."

We performed a retrospective review of 104 cases of emergent scrotal exploration performed for testicular torsion by 3 pediatric urologists from 2003 to 2017. Patients with neonatal torsion, negative scrotal exploration, or exploration for presumed intermittent testicular torsion were excluded. Univariable logistic regression was performed to assess if any factors predicted direction of testicular rotation. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of testicular salvage. Of 104 cases of acute testicular torsion, information regarding the direction of testicular rotation was available in 81 patients. Lateral testicular rotation occurred in 38 cases (46%). No factors were found to be predictive of direction of torsion. Orchiectomy for testicular nonviability was performed in 50 of 104 cases (48%). On univariable analysis, younger age (p = .002), absence of gastrointestinal symptoms (P = .02), time to exploration (P < .001), testicular size differential on ultrasound (p = .002), absence of hydrocele (P = .01), abnormal ultrasound echotexture (P < .001), and degree of torsion (P = .04) were associated with orchiectomy. With the exception of absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, all predictors of orchiectomy remained statistically significant on multivariable analysis. Testicular rotation occurs in a lateral direction in 46% of cases. Lateral manual detorsion should be performed only with awareness of the potential for increasing the degree of testicular rotation. New independent predictors of testicular salvage were identified."

Episodes of torsion can be repeated 1-30 times, leading progressively to development of ischemic trauma of the testis, while in 30-61% of all cases they constitute a precursor of testicular torsion. From January, 2016 to December, 2016, 11 patients in total were admitted to the Emergency Department due to acute scrotal pain that lasted a few minutes (1-5 minutes in most), which had already elapsed at the time of their admission, accompanied with nausea in all patients and vomiting in 5 of them. No swelling or rubor of the scrotum was revealed during physical examination, while in 9 patients it was observed that the suffering testis had transverse orientation. Ultrasonography was negative for pseudotumor or Whirlpool sign, while transverse orientation of the testis was confirmed in 9 patients. All the patients underwent surgical investigation of the suffering hemiscrotum, while Bell Clapper Deformity was found in 9 patients. Fixation of the suffering testis to the mesoscrotal diaphragm with 3 separate sutures by using non-absorbable suture followed. By the same surgical approach, the contralateral hemiscrotum was also investigated. Bilateral high adhesion of the tunica vaginalis was found in 8 out of 9 patients, in whom preventive unilateral orchidopexy was performed.

We performed a retrospective study of patients with surgically confirmed TT and TAT at our institute from January 1990 to December 2013. Clinical findings, physical examination findings, climatic conditions, laboratory data, and color Doppler ultrasound (CDUS) findings were compared between the TT and TAT groups. Seventy patients were included in this study (49 with TT and 21 with TAT). Patients with TT were significantly older than those with TAT (p < 0.001). The ambient temperature at onset was significantly lower in patients with TT than in patients with TAT (p = 0.038). Testicular swelling, high-riding testes, onset during sleep, high leukocyte counts, and high creatine phosphokinase levels were significantly more common in patients with TT than with TAT (p = 0.021, 0.032, 0.006, 0.003, and 0.043, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that age and onset during sleep were significant independent factors for detection of TT. Eight patients (16.3%) underwent preoperative CDUS evaluation, and an absent or decreased blood signal in the involved testes was significantly correlated with the presence of TT (p = 0.018). In clinical features, age and onset during sleep might be helpful to distinguish TT from TAT. When supported by findings, urgent surgical exploration is warranted in patients with suspected TT based on symptoms and CDUS features."

The median duration of pain was 3 (1-8), 4 (1-72), and 48 (12-144) hours in Groups I, II, and III, respectively, and determined as similar in Groups I and II (p = 0.257), although a statistically significant difference was determined between the 3 groups (p < 0.001). TF was applied to Group I after median 10 (0-45) days, and no parenchymal disorder was determined in the median follow-up period of 21.5 (2-40) months. MD that can be easily and immediately performed after the diagnosis of TT decreases ischemia time. This seems to be an efficient and reliable procedure when applied together with elective orchiopexy, as a part of the treatment."

    "abstract": "Blunt scrotal trauma (BST) is common among soldiers but its incidence and outcome are unknown. The purpose of this study was to estimate the incidence, clinical findings, and outcome of BST in soldiers referred to a primary care field physician. The medical records of soldiers in their military services who sustained BST and were evaluated by primary care field doctors over a 10-year period were reviewed. Anamnestic data, physical findings, primary care physician decisions, hospitalization, and surgery rates as well as final outcomes were analyzed. The medical records of 382,036 soldiers were reviewed and 668 cases (0.175%) of BST were identified. All patients complained of scrotal pain and 10% of dysuria. The most common physical findings included: scrotal tenderness (71.7%), scrotal edema (16.2%), and scrotal hematoma (4.8%). In 11.8% of the visits microhematuria was found in urine dip stick. A total of 243 patients (36.4%) were referred to emergency department, but only 9 (3.7%) were hospitalized. Of these, 3 patients underwent surgical exploration due to suspected testicular rupture in ultrasonography. Finally, testicular rupture was found only in 1 patient. This testis was sutured. In another patient testicular torsion was found and orchiectomy done. 168 patients (25.1%) developed prolonged scrotal pain lasting for more than 2 weeks after the trauma. Blunt testicular trauma is not an uncommon phenomenon among soldiers. Surgical intervention is rarely needed and in 99.6% of cases seen by general practitioners supportive management is suffice. The phenomenon of prolonged post-traumatic testicular pain, developing in a quarter of the patients after BST pain deserves more research."

    "abstract": "The objective was to validate the Testicular Workup for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion (TWIST) score among pediatric emergency medicine providers for the evaluation of pediatric males presenting with testicular pain and swelling (acute scrotum). We conducted a prospective cohort study of males 3 months to 18 years old presenting with an acute scrotum. History and physical examination findings, including components of the TWIST score (hard testicle, absent cremasteric reflex, nausea/vomiting, and high riding testicle) as well as diagnostic results (ultrasound, urine, sexually transmitted infection testing) were recorded. Testicular torsion was confirmed by surgical exploration. Frequencies of patient characteristics, TWIST components, and tests were calculated. We performed the kappa statistic for inter-rater reliability and calculated the test characteristics and receiver operator characteristics curves for the TWIST score (range = 0-7). During the study period 258 males were enrolled in the study; 19 (7.4%) had testicular torsion. The mean (±SD) age was 9.8 (±0.3) years. The high-risk TWIST score of 7 had 100% specificity (95% confidence interval [CI] = 98%-100%) with 100% positive predictive value (95% CI = 40%-100%) for testicular torsion. The area under the curve was 0.82. The kappa statistic for the overall TWIST score was fair at 0.39. In this prospective validation of the TWIST score among pediatric emergency providers, the high-risk score demonstrated strong test characteristics for testicular torsion. The TWIST score could be used as part of a standardized approach for evaluation of the pediatric acute scrotum to provide more efficient and effective care."

    "abstract": "There is growing interest in the general activities of a pediatric urologist, whose specialty remains young in the spectrum of modern, organized medicine. Unplanned activities, which are more commonly referred to as consultations, can represent significant additional workload for the urologist seeing scheduled clinic patients or completing elective operative cases. This study sought to better understand the practice patterns surrounding inpatient consultations of pediatric urology, and to describe patterns in reasons, timing, patient and service factors that may lead to patient intervention. Consultations at a tertiary care center were prospectively tracked using a consult note template with embedded data collection fields directly within the Epic electronic medical record. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to predict need for intervention. A total of 351 eligible consultations were completed during the 15-month study period. A total of 174 (50%) consultations originated from the emergency department, with 26% of those having been transferred from another institution (Figure). Consults occurred more frequently at the beginning of the week than at the end of the week (R2 = 0.7545) and at the end of the day rather than the beginning (R2 = 0.2504). Of these consults, 36% required an intervention, defined as bedside procedure, operative procedure or study in interventional radiology. Factors associated with intervention on multivariate analysis included consultation from the emergency department, pertinent radiologic or laboratory findings, and consultation after hours. With the introduction of subspecialty certification in pediatric urology there has been growing concern about a shift in the number and type of consultations seen by pediatric urology. Unlike prior examinations of pediatric urology consultation, the present study recorded diagnoses that appeared to more commonly result in urology consultation than in the past, such as testicular torsion. It highlighted a small subset of children with medical complexity and who were frequently admitted to the hospital, and accounted for nearly one fifth of all consultations. Repeat consultations underscored a need for ongoing education of the family, primary care and emergency department providers, and other services who interface with complex patients with ongoing healthcare needs. The pediatric urology service averaged about one formal consultation per day, with the most common diagnoses being hydronephrosis, urinary tract infection, urolithiasis, testicular torsion, and retention. One third of consults required intervention. Improved understanding of pediatric urology consultation would be helpful to facilitate physician education and improve service efficiency in the hospital setting."

The patient had intra-scrotal testicular torsion of a seminoma which was overlooked initially by Doppler ultrasound, progression of symptoms led to a computed tmomgraphy scan which showed a testicular torsion. Intra-operative findings showed a torsed right testis with completely engorged cord. Right radical orchiectomy was done and indecently histopathology revealed a classical seminoma.

Diagnostic testing is frequently used in evaluation of the acute scrotum; however, there is likely variability in the use of these tests in the emergency department setting. We conducted a cross-sectional study of males with the diagnoses of testicular torsion, appendix testis torsion, and epididymitis/orchitis. We identified emergency department patients in the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database from 2010 to 2015 using diagnostic and procedure codes from the International Classification of Diseases Codes 9 and 10. Frequencies of diagnoses by demographic characteristics and of procedures and diagnostic testing (ultrasound, urinalysis, urine culture and sexually transmitted infection testing) by age group were calculated. We analyzed testing trends over time. We identified 17,000 males with the diagnoses of testicular torsion (21.7%), appendix testis torsion (17.9%), and epididymitis/orchitis (60.3%) from 2010 to 2015. There was substantial variation among hospitals in all categories of testing for each of the diagnoses. Overall, ultrasound utilization ranged from 33.1-100% and urinalysis testing ranged from 17.0-84.9% for all conditions. Only urine culture testing decreased over time for all three diagnoses (40.6% in 2010 to 31.5 in 2015). There was wide variation in the use of diagnostic testing across pediatric hospitals for males with common testicular conditions. Development of evaluation guidelines for the acute scrotum could decrease variation in testing."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion (TT) is a medical emergency that primary affects newborns and young adolescents. It causes testicular injury due to the torsion of the spermatic cord and its components, initially in the venous blood flow and finally in the arterial blood flow. Prompt diagnosis and early surgical management are necessary in managing this urgent situation. The process of the pathophysiological events in ischemia-reperfusion is multifactorial and deals with the perception of the oxidative stress responsible for the consequences of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) stress following TT. Duration and severity of torsion also play a significant role in the oxidative stress. A detrimental result of the defense system of the testes takes place resulting finally in testicular atrophy and impaired function. Antioxidant factors have been experimentally studied in an effort to front this state. They have been classified as endogenous or exogenous antioxidants. Endogenous antioxidants comprise a structure of enzymic enzymatic and non-enzymic enzymatic particles presented within cytoplasm and numerous other subunits in the cells. Exogenous antioxidants include a variety of natural and pharmaceutical agents that may prevent or ameliorate the harmful effects of I/R injury. In this study we review those factors and their ability to enhance the oxidative status of the testis. A feature insight into where we are heading is attempted."

We report a clinical case of a 36-year-old white man who presented at our emergency department with subacute testicular pain. A urine analysis, Doppler ultrasound, surgical exploration, blood analysis, and magnetic resonance imaging were performed to diagnose his condition, to exclude a testicular torsion, and to raise confidence in its non-malignancy. He was treated conservatively. At follow-up, a few months after the incident, he no longer had complaints. Ultrasonography showed remaining hypo-echogenicity of the left upper pole, indicating a sequel of ischemia. Segmental testicular infarction is a rare condition which can be easily confused with a testicular torsion or a testicular tumor.

In emergency conditions, if testicular torsion goes unnoticed and epididymo-orchitis is diagnosed, organ loss may occur. This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of haematologic parameters for the diagnosis of both testicular torsion and epididymo-orchitis and for differential diagnosis of these two diseases. Patients were divided into three groups as those undergoing surgery for testicular torsion, those receiving medical treatment for epididymitis and a healthy control group. All patients had complete blood counts taken with determinations of mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR), neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and leucocyte counts. These were then compared between groups. Leucocyte, MPV and NLR values were higher in both the epididymitis and torsion groups compared to the controls (p < .001). Platelet counts and PLR were significantly higher in the epididymitis group compared to the other two groups (p < .001). Leucocyte, MPV and NLR values may be used in the diagnosis of epididymitis and testicular torsion. Platelet counts and PLR appear to be useful in differentiating epididymitis from testicular torsion.

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion (TT), a common surgical emergency worldwide, is typically treated with orchiectomy or orchiopexy. It is widely accepted that the chance of salvaging the testicle declines with time and degree of torsion. The impact of ethnicity on outcome is less well understood, and the association between weather and onset of TT remains a controversy. It is important to know the signs of TT so that appropriate treatment can be given quickly. The purpose of this study was to provide a detailed analysis of registered cases of TT in adolescent patients diagnosed at a single institution to better understand the association between clinical indicators and surgical outcomes and to examine some remaining controversies in the literature on TT. A retrospective chart review was conducted, using medical records from the present institution. Data were collected for 165 patients who met the following inclusion criteria: 1) adolescent males between 10 and 18 years of age at the time of diagnosis, and 2) TT between January 2001 and June 2013. Of the 165 patients, 38% had orchiectomies. Patients with orchiectomies had longer wait times for surgery (p < 0.0001)-but not greater driving times, driving distances, or degrees of torsion-than those with orchiopexies (Table). Yet, among patients who waited less than the median wait time to surgery (197 min), patients with orchiectomies had greater degrees of torsion than did those with orchiopexies (p = 0.02). Assuming that patients without reference to presence of bell clapper deformity in their medical notes did not have the deformity, those with orchiectomies were less likely to have bell clapper deformity than were those with orchiopexies (p < 0.01). Although mean atmospheric temperature was unassociated with onset of TT and with surgical outcome in general, patients without bell clapper deformity had TT on relatively colder days (p = 0.02). Wait time to surgery positively correlates with orchiectomy. Early identification and intervention is vital to testicular salvage. As the degree of torsion increases, the blood supply to the affected testis decreases and the time required to inflict testicular vascular damage decreases. Our results showed the presence of the bell clapper deformity moderated the relationship between temperature and TT: Those without the deformity had torsions on colder days than did those with the deformity. A comprehensive multi-centered study could help draw further conclusions regarding temperature correlation and the bell clapper deformity."

    "title": "How do they get here: Does the method of transportation impact salvage for patients with testicular torsion?",
    "abstract": "A growing number of patients are arriving at our tertiary care center for evaluation of possible testicular torsion using ambulance or helicopter transport. In many cases the parents arrive by car before the patient arrives. Are these advanced methods of medical transport worth the expense and risk in the case of suspected testicular torsion? We evaluated the total number of patients presenting to our emergency room for suspected testicular torsion to see if the means of transport affected testicular survival. Retrospective. As shown below in the table, the means of transport did not impact on testicular salvage. It is understandable that many patients with scrotal pain seek treatment closer to home because of their pediatrician's recommendation and/or family preference. However once evaluated many patients are transferred because of a lack of urologists willing to evaluate and treat the pediatric patients in community settings or because of a lack of anesthesia support. These patients are often transported by ambulance or helicopter. Our data would suggest that there is no improvement in the testicular salvage rate seen with these more advanced means of medical transportation compared with transfer by private car even when we restrict the analysis to patients traveling from over 40 miles away. We suspect that important time is lost while waiting to make such transfer arrangements. Furthermore transfer by ambulance or helicopter is more expensive and these costs are often passed on to families. Transfer by helicopter is also riskier. While an argument can be made in favor of medical transport over long distances or long driving times, this data suggests that many of these transfers could be accomplished by car with no effect on testicular salvage rates. The rate of testicular salvage was not affected by the means of transport to our tertiary facility. Only 4 patients would have required advanced of medical transport if this were limited to those facilities over 100 miles or 1.5 hours driving time away. This would achieve a substantial cost savings with no measurable change in outcome."

Rare, but important problems, such as pediatric testicular tumours, may also present in the office setting. Many of these outpatient visits are to primary care physicians, who should have an appreciation of the timing and need for referral. The purpose of this review is to familiarize the general urologist and primary care physician with these varied pathologies and give insight into their assessment and management. Some of these same conditions are seen in adult patients, but there are some significant differences in their management in the pediatric group. In addition, the utility of imaging studies, such as ultrasound, are discussed within each pathological entity.

This study demonstrates histopathological and physiological effects of testicular ischemia/perfusion (I/R) injury and the possible protective effects of Ginkgo biloba treatment. Fifty adult male Wistar rats, 180-200 gm, were randomly divided into sham-operated, Gingko biloba supplemented, ischemia only, I/R, and Gingko biloba treated I/R groups. Overnight fasted rats were anaesthetized by Pentobarbital; I/R was performed by left testis 720° rotation in I/R and treated I/R groups. Orchiectomy was performed for histopathological studies and detection of mitochondrial NAD+. Determination of free testosterone, FSH, TNF-α, and IL1-β in plasma was performed. Plasma-free testosterone was significantly decreased, while plasma FSH, TNF-α, IL-1β, and testicular mitochondrial NAD+ were significantly increased in I/R group compared to control group. These parameters were reversed in Gingko biloba treated I/R group compared to I/R group. I/R caused marked testicular damage and increased APAF-1 in the apoptotic cells which were reversed by Ginkgo biloba treatment. It could be concluded that I/R caused subfertility induced by apoptosis and oxidative stress manifested by the elevated testicular mitochondrial NAD+, which is considered a new possible mechanism. Also, testicular injury could be reduced by Gingko biloba administration alone."

In this study; we aim to evaulate patients with acute scrotal pathologies who were interned in our department. All hospital data of cases who were interned at our deparment due to acute scrotum in between June 2010-June 2014 were evaluated retrospectively. Cases with incarcerated inguinal herni were excluded in this study. In a 4-year-period 114 cases were interned in our department with acute scrotum. Mean age of the patients was 7.6±4.577 years (min: 1m-max: 18yrs). Doppler US was performed in 112 patients to evaluate the blood flow while in 2 patients applied after normal office hours were evaluated without Doppler US and operated under emergency conditions. The patients had received diagnosis of epididymitis/epididymo-orchitis/orchitis (n=83 cases; 72.8%), testicular torsion (n=24; 21.1%), torsion of the appendix testis (n=2; 1.8%) with and traumatic hydrocele/ hematocele (n=5; 4.4%). While detorsion was performed in 18 (75%) cases with testicular torsion and orchiectomy in 6 (25%) cases. Histopathological evaluation of orchiectomy specimens revealed hemorrhagic necrosis and hemorrhagic infarction or ischemic changes. Normal testicular size and vascularity were detected in 11 (61.1%) cases with detorsioned testis as detected by follow-up Doppler US. Late orchiectomy was performed in 7 cases (38.9%) with complete atrophy due to lack of blood supply. Although Doppler US is very helpful for differential diagnosis of patients with acute scrotum who applied early period, if Doppler US will lead to a waste of time, direct surgery without delay will reduce the risk of testicular loss."

    "abstract": "Gross testicular heterogeneity on ultrasound has been associated with testis loss following testicular torsion in children. We aimed to quantify the extent of temporal heterogeneity associated with testis loss in testicular torsion cases using a noninvasive technique to determine a HI (heterogeneity index) on ultrasound images. We retrospectively studied the records of patients who presented with acute scrotal pain to the Pediatric Emergency Department over a 6-year period. Ultrasound images of the affected testis and the unaffected contralateral testis were examined using a proprietary program to determine the extent of heterogeneity of each image. The difference between the HI of the torsed testis and that of the contralateral normal testis was termed ΔHI. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis was performed to determine the ΔHI threshold for nonviability. Among 529 patients who presented with acute scrotal pain 147 had testicular torsion based on surgical findings. Of these 147 patients 110 (74.8%) were found to have a viable testis while 37 (25.2%) had a nonviable testis. Using the ΔHI cutoff of 0.394 or greater for nonviability, sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 94.5%, respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 86% and 100%, respectively. Our results demonstrate that a quantifiable temporal gradation of heterogeneity exists and the heterogeneity index can be used as an objective parameter to determine the viability of a torsed testicle. By developing the technology to measure the heterogeneity index in real time, we could potentially identify which patients with testicular torsion have a nonviable testicle and, thus, would not require immediate surgical exploration."

Despite having a benign abdomen, the patient experienced a rapid clinical deterioration in the ED after a previously undiagnosed metastatic lesion to his liver eroded into his hepatic artery. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: This case highlights the importance of performing a GU examination in all patients presenting with abdominal pain and discusses a rare presentation of a relatively common male condition.

We retrospectively reviewed all clinical and instrumental data of emergency scrotal exploration performed for acute scrotal pain at two different Urological Department in a 10 year period. Results of surgical exploration represented the four diagnostic categories in which patients were divided for statistical evaluation. We evaluated the relationship between diagnosis performed by testicular surgical exploration and the all clinical data available including surgeon involved in the procedures. A total of 220 explorative scrotal surgery were considered. We divided the cases in 4 categories according to the diagnostic results of each surgical procedure. Of all, spermatic cord torsion was diagnosed in 45% (99/220). The total testis salvage rate was of 78.8%. The patients with a diagnosis of spermatic cord torsion were older than patients with appendix torsion (15 vs 11 years in mean). When the affected side was the left, the probability to have a diagnosis of spermatic cord torsion was higher than the right side [χ2 (2, N = 218) = 11.77, p &lt; 0.01]. Time elapsing between onset of symptoms and testicular salvagewas significantly lower even than in case of appendix torsion/necrosis (p &lt; .0001), and of others pathologies diagnosed (p = .0383). In case of spermatic cord torsion, in addition to the clinical data, patient age and left side affected may represent an independent diagnostic predicting factor. The time elapsing between onset of symptoms and explorative surgery remain the only still prognostic factor for testicular viability."

Testicular rotation was less among successfully detorsed patients. Orchiectomy was performed in 2 of 72 successfully detorsed patients (2.8%), compared to 15 of 61 patients (24.6%) in whom detorsion was not attempted or was unsuccessful (OR 11.23, p = 0.0002). Logistic regression indicated that surgical wait time (OR 0.95, p = 0.002) and successful detorsion (OR 17.38, p = 0.001) were independently associated with orchiopexy. Preoperative manual detorsion was associated with improved surgical salvage in patients with testicular torsion."

    "abstract": "We examined testicular torsion presentation and referral trends at our institution before and after pediatric urology subspecialty certification. We reviewed patients with testicular torsion presenting directly to our pediatric hospital emergency department (\"direct\") or transferred urgently from an outside institution (\"referred\") who underwent detorsion and orchiopexy or orchiectomy between 2005 and 2015. Presentations were considered acute (less than 24 hours) or delayed (24 hours or greater) based on time from symptom onset. Primary outcomes were case volume and presentation trends through time. Secondary outcomes were effect of presenting location and transport variables on orchiectomy rate. Incidence of testicular torsion increased from 15 cases in 2005 to 32 in 2015. Annual incidence of direct cases increased slightly during the study period from 12 to 17, whereas incidence of referred cases increased from 3 in 2005 to 15 in 2015. Proportion of referred acute cases markedly increased from precertification (4 of 63, 6.3%) to postcertification period (42 of 155, 27.1%; p <0.01). The majority of referred cases (59 of 83, 71.1%) presented during weekday nights or weekends compared to a minority of direct cases (59 of 135, 43.7%; p <0.01). Orchiectomy rates were similar between direct and referred cases across all study periods and were not significantly impacted by presentation location, transport distance or transport modality (all p >0.05). Patients with testicular torsion have been increasingly referred to our institution, with the majority presenting on weekday nights and weekends. Our data do not support routinely transferring these patients to dedicated pediatric hospitals."

We performed a retrospective study of all consecutive patients with acute testicular symptoms referring to our pediatric emergency department (ED) from January 2010 to December 2013. We analyzed 1091 patients, with a mean age of 9 years. DUS was performed in 498 patients (40.8%); 107 patients (8.8%) underwent surgery and 41 patients (3.3%) had a TT. The following clinical findings were collected: presence of scrotal pain, erythema and swelling, spermatic cord pain and abnormal cremasteric reflex. The clinical findings significantly associated with TT were spermatic cord pain (OR = 37, 95% CI: 11.9-111.1, P &lt; .001) and abnormal cremasteric reflex (OR = 47.6, 95% CI: 13.5-166.6, P &lt; .001); the presence of swelling resulted confounding (OR = 2.3, 95% CI: 0.7-8.4, P &lt; .001). Scrotal pain was not significantly associated with TT (P = .9), while erythema made TT unlikely (OR = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.07-0.7, P = .0445). In all cases the DUS significantly increased the predictivity. TT was present in 3.3% of patients presenting with testicular symptoms. The predictivity based on clinical findings resulted high and the negative exploration rate for TT was 62%. DUS increased the predictivity in all patients.&nbsp."

The annual incidence of testicular torsion is approximately 1/4,000 persons under 25 years, with highest prevalence between 12 and 18 years old. It usually occurs without apparent cause, but it has been associated with anatomical, traumatic, and environmental factors, among others. A male 15 year-old male, with no history of importance, was seen in the Emergency Department, presenting with a sudden and continuous pain in the left testicle. It was accompanied by a pain that radiated to the abdomen and left inguinal area, with nausea and vomiting of more than 12h onset. Doppler ultrasound showed changes suggestive of testicular torsion. Surgery was performed that showed findings of a necrotic left testicle with rotation of the spermatic cord of 360°. A left orchiectomy was performed. Testicular torsion should always be considered one of the leading causes of acute scrotal pain. Delays in diagnosis should be avoided as this is directly related to the percentage of testicular salvage or loss."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant effect of apigenin (APG) on the testicular ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Forty-two Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups. Sham group underwent operation of the left testis. In the torsion-detorsion groups C15 and C120, the left testis was rotated 1080(o) for three hours. The treatment groups Ap15 and Ap120 received the same surgical procedure as groups C15 and C120, but APG was administered intravenously at the same time of detorsion via the right femoral vein. Left orchiectomy was performed 15 min after detorsion at groups C15 and Ap15, and at 120 min at groups C120 and Ap120 for histopathologic and immunohistochemical evaluation. In I/R-untreated groups C15 and C120, there was a moderate to severe distortion of the tubules with lesions that varied between grades III and IV according to histopathological finding. In APG-treated groups Ap15 and Ap120, most of the lesions showed injuries of grades II and III with mild and moderate histopathological features. In Terminal deoxynucleotide transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling (Tunel) assay, APG-treated animals showed a statistically significantly decreased number of apoptotic cells compared to groups C15 and C120.

This study was conducted to examine the spectrum of diagnoses in young man with ASP in a prehospital setting, the frequency of significant diagnoses, and their outcomes. The medical records of young adults in their obligatory military service presenting with ASP to primary care clinics from 2004 to 2014 were reviewed using the keywords: pain, testis, torsion, and orchialgia. Anamnestic data, physical findings, primary care physician decisions, and final outcomes were analyzed. A total of 9922 medical visits were recorded. Idiopathic scrotal pain, varicocele, scrotal trauma, and genital tract infections were the most common diagnoses. In 3 visits (0.03%), testicular cancer was diagnosed. Testicular torsion was the etiology of ASP in only 12 (0.12%) visits, and 60% the testes were salvaged. The mean duration of symptoms in the salvaged group was 6.33 hours; and in the nonsalvaged group, 44 hours. Testicular torsion is the etiology of ASP in only 0.12% of the visits to the primary care clinic. Patient delay before attending the primary care is responsible for most of the testes lost. Patient education in addition to high index of suspicion of primary care physicians is needed for salvage of more testicles."

This study identifies factors associated with transfer for pediatric testicular torsion. This retrospective cross-sectional study examined emergency department (ED) visits for testicular torsion by men aged 1-21 y in National Emergency Department Sample from 2006 to 2012. Freestanding children's hospitals were excluded. Analyses were weighted to produce nationally representative estimates. Patient- and institutional-level predictors of transfer were evaluated using Rao-Scott chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression. There were 11,435 ED visits for testicular torsion resulting in admission or transfer. In multivariable regression, the probability of transfer decreased with increasing age but remained higher for patients aged 15-17 y than for those aged 18-21 y (odds ratio [OR] = 1.51, P < 0.001) and was lower for patients living in zip codes in the highest income quartile (OR = 0.69 versus lowest, P = 0.003) or with listed comorbidities (OR = 0.55, P < 0.001). Transfer was less likely in the Northeast (OR = 0.28 versus Midwest, P < 0.001), at urban hospitals (OR = 0.31, P < 0.001), teaching institutions (OR = 0.55, P < 0.001), and level I or II trauma centers (OR = 0.31, P < 0.001).

Older adolescents with testicular torsion are more likely to be transferred than young adults. Interhospital transfers in these patients may represent a potential target for improving care.

We present a case of a 2-day-old term infant with acute onset right-sided scrotal discolouration and tenderness. The infant was promptly taken to the operating theatre for emergency scrotal exploration. Bilateral extravaginal testicular torsion was identified, with the right testis appearing to have a more established ischaemic appearance compared to that on the left side. Intraoperative findings were representative of metachronous PTT with a short time period of only several hours separating the torsion events. Both testes were detorted and fixated in the scrotum. The infant made an uneventful recovery. Outpatient clinic review at 6 weeks and 6 months postoperatively confirmed no clinical evidence of testicular atrophy. Given the potential for contralateral torsion and the morbidity of anorchia, our experience supports the role for emergency scrotal exploration in suspected PTT."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion (TT) remains one of the most common urological emergencies. The length of time from onset of symptoms to detorsion and degree of spermatic cord twisting are usually the most important factors for testicular damage. Therefore early presentation, accurate diagnosis, and prompt treatment are important factors for optimizing the testicular salvage rate. While delay in seeking medical attention is a common cause of testicular loss in pediatric patients with testicular torsion, delays in diagnosis and treatment can be preventable causes of testicular loss. In this study, we aimed to develop a standardized process to improve the patient flow from the Emergency Room (ER) to Operating Room (OR) for TT patients in an academic children's hospital. Thirty consecutive pediatric patients with acute testicular torsion between November 2013 and July 2014 served as the control group. A scrotal pain checklist was implemented in July 2014, and 30 consecutive patients from July 2014 until April 2015 served as the study group. Perioperative parameters including times, ultrasound (US) findings, and surgical results were reviewed. The mean ages of the control group and the study group were similar (12.3 ± 4.9 years and 11.5 ± 5 years, respectively) (p = 0.575). ER arrival to OR time, triage completion to OR time, and scrotal US to OR time were significantly decreased in the study group (p < 0.001) (Table). Although triage time and ER arrival to scrotal US times were decreased in the study group, the differences were not significant (p = 0.071, p = 0.112, respectively). Utilizing scoring tools during the triage of patients with scrotal pain can help identify high-risk patients earlier and prevent unnecessary use of resources in an ER serving a large pediatric population. Limitations of this pilot study include the limited number of patients and the potential for the Hawthorne effect (staff awareness of the study). Additionally, we did not examine scrotal pain checklist scores for other acute scrotal diseases. This study focused on a quality improvement process for TT patients, in order to reduce ER to OR times. A standardized process with use of a scrotal pain checklist and prompt communication between the ER, Urology, and Radiology teams led to significantly reduced times from the ER to the OR. Standardized processes for pediatric patients with testicular torsion may help to improve testicular survival rates."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a common urological emergency among adolescent boys and young men. Rotation of the testis and twisting of the spermatic cord rapidly leads to ischemia, resulting in a loss of germ cells. Thus, prompt diagnosis and urgent surgical intervention are required, but the subsequent release of the torsion induces reperfusion injury, which causes further damage to the ischemic testis. Testicular torsion-detorsion (ischemia-reperfusion) injury triggers the generation of reactive oxygen species, pro-inflammatory cytokines, neutrophil recruitment, lipid peroxidation, anoxia and apoptosis, which carry a significant risk of subsequent infertility. Previously, the effects of numerous pharmacological agents and treatments have been evaluated to prevent testicular ischemia-reperfusion injury in animal models. We propose a new treatment, especially postconditioning, to prevent adverse effects of ischemia-reperfusion injury after testicular torsion-detorsion."

Missed diagnosis and diagnostic delays put patients at risk for testicular loss and have resulted in malpractice litigation. Using a national database, we sought to describe testicular torsion malpractice cases tried at the state and federal level and investigate factors associated with successful defense by the provider. We reviewed the Lexis Nexis academic legal database. We searched all cases using the terms \"testicular torsion\" and \"medical malpractice\" from 1985 to 2015. From this search, we compiled various medical and legal aspects of the case including the outcome of the trial. We performed multivariate logistic regression to determine which factors were associated with successful defense at the state level. Fifty-three malpractice cases of testicular torsion were included. State appeals were in favor of providers in 26 (50%) of cases. The average time between initial presentation of the patient and the state verdict decision was 5 years. Emergency room (ER) physicians were the most common provider sued (35%). Approximately half of the patients (26, 51%) first presented to the ER, and atypical presentations were common, as 16 (31%) presented with abdominal pain only. The proportion of patients with false-negative ultrasounds was 16 of 25 (64%). If the patient first presented to the ER, the doctor was less likely to have a successful defense (OR = 0.23; 95% CI 0.06-0.79]). Most verdicts (8/9, 89%) were in favor of urologists. One urologist lost at the state level because of delayed time to the operating room. Atypical clinical presentations and false-negative ultrasound findings are common in testicular torsion malpractice litigation at the state and federal level. Providers who used ultrasound were not more likely to win the state appeal, and providers whose patients presented to the ER were less likely to have a successful defense.

Presentation delay is an important modifiable cause of orchiectomy; yet, families are not routinely educated about torsion or its urgency. The present study assessed parental knowledge regarding acute scrotal pain. An anonymous survey was distributed to parents in Urology and ENT offices, asking about their children's gender and scrotal pain history, urgency of response to a child's acute scrotal pain, and familiarity with testicular torsion. Surveys of 479 urology and 59 ENT parents were analyzed. The results between the two were not statistically different. Among the urology parents, 34% had heard of testicular twisting/torsion, most commonly through friends, relatives or knowing someone with torsion (35%); only 17% were informed by pediatricians (Summary Figure). Parents presenting for a child's scrotal pain were significantly more likely to have heard of torsion (69%) than those presenting for other reasons (30%, OR 5.24, P < 0.0001). Only 13% of parents of boys had spoken with their children about torsion. Roughly three quarters of them would seek emergent medical attention - by day (75%) or night (82%) - for acute scrotal pain. However, urgency was no more likely among those who knew about torsion. This was the first study to assess parental knowledge of the emergent nature of acute scrotal pain in a non-urgent setting, and most closely approximating their level of knowledge at the time of pain onset. It also assessed parents' hypothetical responses to the scenario, which was markedly different than documented presentation times, highlighting a potential area for improvement in presentation times. Potential limitations included lack of respondent demographic data, potential sampling bias of a population with greater healthcare knowledge or involvement, and assessment of parents only. Parental knowledge of testicular torsion was lacking, suggesting both ineffective education in the well-child setting and inappropriately timed education during or after pain occurrence. Awareness was most commonly anecdotal or taught unreliably, as even familiar parents were no more likely to seek emergent attention. Therefore, standardized, effective parental education on testicular torsion and the need for prompt presentation is needed, as is improvement in the quality of information taught in the healthcare setting. Further assessment of knowledge among preadolescent and adolescent boys regarding testicular torsion is warranted. It is hopeful that pre-hospital delay may be minimized and greater rates of testicular salvageability may be achieved through these efforts."

Any treatment opportunity reducing the destructive effect of testicular torsion is important for the future life of patients. In this experimental study we investigated the protective effect of mannitol on ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in a rat testes torsion model. In total, 32 male Sprague Dawley rats were included. Four experimental groups included eight rats each. Group A was a sham group in which the right testis was brought out through a scrotal incision and then replaced in the scrotum without torsion. In Group B, the right testis was torsioned, by rotating 720° clockwise and fixed to the scrotum with no treatment. In Group C, the same testicular torsion process was performed with saline infusion just after testicular torsion. In group D, mannitol infusion was used just after testicular torsion. Testicles were detorsioned after 3 h and left inside for more than 2 h before orchiectomy. Histopathological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical analyses were performed. Testicular architecture was disturbed significantly in the torsion groups without mannitol infusion. However, testicular tissue structure was significantly better in the mannitol-treated group, demonstrating a protective effect. Similar findings were also shown for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) index and antioxidant activity; both were higher in the mannitol group than in the no-treatment and saline groups (p < 0.01). The apoptotic index was also significantly lower in the mannitol-treated group compared with the no treatment and saline groups (p < 0.01). The seminiferous tubule structure in testicular torsion without mannitol treatment was significantly disturbed, whereas the structural disruption was considerably less in the mannitol group. Mannitol treatment also decreased reactive oxygen radical levels significantly and was able to decrease apoptosis. These results were consistent with other organ model studies that evaluated the protective effects of mannitol treatment in I/R injury. Mannitol infusion had a protective effect against I/R injury in testicular torsion in rats. This experimental study may guide clinicians to evaluate the effectiveness of mannitol in human testicular torsion."

Parameters include testis swelling (2 points), hard testis (2), absent cremasteric reflex (1), nausea/vomiting (1) and high riding testis (1). While TWIST has been validated when scored by urologists, its diagnostic accuracy among nonurological providers is unknown. We assessed the usefulness of the TWIST score when determined by nonurological nonphysician providers, mirroring emergency room evaluation of acute scrotal pain. Children with unilateral acute scrotum were prospectively enrolled in a National Institutes of Health clinical trial. After undergoing basic history and physical examination training, emergency medical technicians calculated TWIST score and determined Tanner stage per pictorial diagram. Clinical torsion was confirmed by surgical exploration. All data were captured into REDCap™ and ROC curves were used to evaluate the diagnostic usefulness of TWIST. Of 128 patients (mean age 11.3 years) 44 (13.0 years) had torsion. TWIST score cutoff values of 0 and 6 derived from ROC analysis identified 31 high, 57 intermediate and 40 low risk cases (positive predictive value 93.5%, negative predictive value 100%). TWIST score assessed by nonurologists, such as emergency medical technicians, is accurate. Low risk patients do not require ultrasound to rule out torsion. High risk patients can proceed directly to surgery, with more than 50% avoiding ultrasound. In the future emergency medical technicians and/or emergency room triage personnel may be able to calculate TWIST score to guide radiological evaluation and immediate surgical intervention at initial assessment long before urological consultation."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a rare but important entity in the discipline of urology, as urgent action is required to save the testicle anatomically and functionally. Occurring mainly in the young prepubertal or pubertal male, testicular torsion is also seen in young adults. The annual incidence has been estimated to be 4.5 cases per 100,000 male subjects. The outcome of testicular torsion, in cases of unsuccessful emergent intervention, is total or partial infarction of the testicular tissue. We present a case of partial testicular ischemia due to testicular torsion."

    "title": "[UROLOGIC DISEASES IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT].",
    "abstract": "(Objectives) This paper aimed to report the clinical statistics on urologic diseases treated in the emergency department (ED). (Patients and methods) We retrospectively evaluated 1,480 patients diagnosed with urologic diseases in the ED between January 2013 and December 2014. We reviewed the patients' sex, age, main complaints, emergency grade, care-seeking process, hospitalization, examination items, and diagnosis. We also reviewed the correct-diagnosis rates of patients who visited the ED for the first time and were followed up at the urology department. (Results) Of the patients, 2.6% were diagnosed as having a urologic disease, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.5:1. The age distribution ranged from 0 to 101 years, with a median age of 53 years. Patients who required hospitalization accounted for 17.8%. The diagnoses were urolithiasis (546 cases), cystitis (220 cases), and pyelonephritis (137 cases), in order of frequency. The correct-diagnosis rates of urolithiasis (91.2%), benign prostatic hyperplasia (75.0%), and pyelonephritis (71.9%) were high. However, those of testicular torsion (0%), urologic neoplasm (26.7%), prostatitis (35.7%), and epididymitis (35.7%) were low. (Conclusion) In the ED, 82.2% of cases of urologic diseases were mild and did not require hospitalization. The correct-diagnosis rate of acute scrotum was low, as it was difficult to diagnose and thus difficult to manage in the ED. Therefore, urologists should cooperate with ED staff and warn them that cases of acute scrotum should be subjected to emergency consultation."

    "abstract": "(Objectives) Testicular torsion (TT) is a socially and clinically important urological emergency condition because delayed diagnosis and treatment can lead to testicular loss. Although a possible association between TT and low ambient temperature has been argued, the clinical significance of the association has not been fully elucidated. We retrospectively collected acute scrotum cases and investigated the association between the risk of TT among acute scrotums and ambient temperatures on the day of onset. (Patients and methods) We studied 105 consecutive acute scrotum patients with suspected TT who underwent urgent surgical exploration between October 2004 and October 2014. The patients' age, residential area, time and date of onset, laboratory findings, and operative findings were collected from their medical records. Climate data, including daily mean ambient temperature (DMAT), diurnal temperature change (DTC), humidity, and atmospheric pressure at the time of onset, were obtained from the Japan Meteorological Agency website. The chi-square and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to evaluate statistical differences. Logistic regression analysis used to identify significant predictors of TT. (Results) The median age of the patients was 13 years (range, 1-43 years). The affected side was the right/left/bilateral side in 46/58/1 of the patients. Surgical exploration revealed TT in 67 patients. The remaining 38 non-TT patients included 12 with testicular appendage torsions, 12 with epididymal appendage torsions, 9 with epididymitis, 2 with orchitis, 2 with idiopathic hematomas, and 1 with allergic purpura. The median DMATs at the day of onset were 10.8°C (1.8-29.4°C) in the TT patients and 19.4°C (1.9-29.1°C) in the non-TT patients. The incidence of TT among the patients with acute scrotum explored surgically (TT incidence) in days with DMATs <15°C (80%) was significantly higher than that in days with DMATs ≥ 15°C (45%; p<0.001). During days with DMATs ≥15°C, the TT incidence in days with DTCs ≥10°C (62%) was significantly higher than that in days with DTCs <10°C (32%; p=0.037). Multivariate analysis revealed higher age (≥14), low serum C-reactive protein level (<0.5 ng/ml) and low DMAT (<15°C) were significant risk factor for TT in patients with acute scrotum undergoing surgery. (Conclusions) It should be noted that in this study, the onset of acute scrotum during days with low ambient temperatures or large DTCs was associated with a moderate to high possibility of TT."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a well-known medical emergency that can lead to pathological changes in the testicular tissues and male infertility. This investigation was undertaken to gain insight into the effects of an endothelin type A receptor antagonist (BQ123) on torsion-induced germ cell loss. Twenty-eight male Wistar albino rats were divided into four groups. In group I (control group), a sham operation to the left testis was performed. In group II (I/R injury), I/R injury was created by rotating the left testis 720° in a clockwise direction for 2 h and detorsing the testis after 2 h. In group III (I/R injury+BQ123), the rats were subjected to I/R injury and BQ123 injection (1 mg/kg, intravenous). In group IV (control+BQ123), the sham operated rats were subjected to BQ123. The testes of the rats were removed in all groups. Torsion-induced apoptosis and the effects of BQ123 were examined by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) nick end labelling (TUNEL) technique, immunohistochemistry and western blotting. In group II, the number of TUNEL-positive cells increased after testicular torsion. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting showed that apoptotic proteins (active caspase 3 and Bax) were upregulated, and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 was downregulated in I/R injury. The administration of BQ123 caused a significant decrease in the number of apoptotic cells and the expression of apoptotic proteins (p<0.05) when compared with the I/R injury group. No significant effect of BQ123 was observed in the testicular cells of group IV. This animal study provides evidence of the regulatory effects of BQ123 on torsion-induced testicular apoptosis."

    "abstract": "Scrotal blunt trauma may result in injuries, such as testicular rupture, dislocation, torsion, hematoma, spermatic cord injury or contusion, and epididymal, scrotal, and urethral injuries. Ultrasonography (US) has a crucial role in the evaluation of those kinds of pathologies. Early diagnosis of testicular rupture may lead to the salvaging of the testicle by prompt surgical exploration within 72 h. A 21-year-old male with right scrotal swelling and pain complaints was admitted to another hospital one month ago. Epididymo-orchitis was diagnosed and the patient was given medical treatment. The patient was admitted to our emergency service with ongoing complaints. The patient stated that the pain and swelling suddenly developed after prolonged marching. On US, a large hematoma was detected between the leaves of the tunica vaginalis, and rupture from the lower pole was diagnosed. On color Doppler US, no vascularity was observed in the heterogeneous testicular parenchyma. Traumatic torsion was primarily suggested. Intraoperatively, an extratesticular hematoma, hematocele, and rupture were confirmed but torsion was not found. Because the hematoma entirely replaced the normal parenchyma, orchiectomy was performed. Testicular rupture may occur even after moderate sportive action such as prolonged marching. If any delay occurs in diagnosis and/or operation, the coagulum may replace the entire parenchyma. We think that US and clinical findings may sometimes mislead the physicians and cause misdiagnoses, such as inflammation or torsion. In this paper, we present a complex delayed diagnosed example case of testicular rupture clinically mimicing epididymo-orchitis and radiologically mimicing traumatic testicular torsion."

Testicular torsion is a medical emergency that usually requires surgical exploration. However, testicular malignancy has been anecdotally reported in association with torsion in surgical specimens. However, the published data remain scant on the association between torsion and the presence of testicular tumors. The present retrospective study explored the association between torsion and testicular cancer in patients with testicular torsion undergoing orchiectomy during scrotal exploration. A medical record review was performed of patients who had had a diagnosis of testicular torsion from January 2003 to February 2015. The clinicopathologic characteristics of the patients were recorded. A total of 32 patients were identified. Their mean age was 21.1 years (range, 7-39 years). All the patients had unilateral testicular torsion, which affected the left side in 17 and the right side in 15. Manual detorsion was successful in 6 patients, and 26 patients underwent emergency surgery with testicular detorsion (6 fixation surgery and 20 orchiectomy). The type of incision was scrotal in 6, inguinal in 10, and unspecified in 4. Pathologic examination of the orchiectomy specimens showed malignancy in 2 cases (seminoma and malign mixed germ cell tumor). To the best of our knowledge, the present single-center case series is the largest case series to date of testicular torsion and showed an association between testicular torsion and testicular cancer of 6.4%. However, further larger series of the association between testicular torsion and cancer are needed to explore the relationship between testicular torsion and testicular cancer."

    "abstract": "The litigious nature of the American medical environment is a major concern for physicians, with an estimated annual cost of $10 billion. The purpose of this study is to identify causes of litigation in cases of testicular torsion and what factors contribute to verdicts or settlements resulting in indemnity payments. Publicly available jury verdict reports were retrieved from the Westlaw legal database (Thomson Reuters, New York, NY). In order to identify pertinent cases, we used the search terms \"medical malpractice\" and \"testicular torsion\" with date ranging from 2000 to 2013. Jury verdicts, depositions, and narrative summaries were evaluated for their medical basis, alleged malpractice, findings, and indemnity payment(s) (if any). Fifty-two cases were identified that were relevant to this study. Fifty-one percent of relevant cases were found in favor of the defendant physician, with the remaining 49% involving an indemnity payment (13% of which were settled). The most commonly sued medical providers were emergency physicians (48% of defendants), with urologists being second most common and making up 23% of the defendant pool. Emergency physicians were significantly more likely to make indemnity payments than urologists. Testicular torsion is a delicate condition and requires expertise in evaluation and treatment. When emergency physicians choose not to consult an urologist for possible torsion, they leave themselves open to litigation risk. When an urologist is involved in torsion litigation, they are rarely unsuccessful in their defense. Finally, ultrasound is no guarantee for success against litigation."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion (TT), or twisting of the testicle resulting in a strangulation of the blood supply, occurs in men whose tissue surrounding the testicle is not well attached to the scrotum. It is important to emphasize that testicular torsion is a medical emergency. The aim of this study is to evaluate the second look exploration and outcomes in TT. Seventy boys out of 124 patients underwent early exploration and 48 hours later second look exploration due to TT. All patients were checked with preoperative color-doppler ultrasonography (CDU) and intraoperative bleeding test. Data included age at admission, side of pathology, relation of TT with season of year, duration of preoperative history, degree of testicular torsion, CDU findings, and degree of bleeding; results of second look exploration, follow-up, and outcomes were analyzed. Totally 70 patients were included in this study within five years, of which mean age was 28.6 ± 32.9 months (range 1 to 144), 48% of our patients had nausea and vomiting. Preoperative CDU showed absent/weak flow in 50 (71%) cases. Winter showed most frequently (44%) referred cases of testicular torsion. Orchidopexy was performed in 44 (63%) and orchidectomy in 26 (37%) cases after second look exploration. Mean follow-up duration was 3.1 ± 1.4 years. 4 (9%) cases in orchidopexy group developed testicular atrophy during follow-up, all four cases had a history of longer than 12 hours and grade II testicular bleeding test intra-operatively. Other orchidopexy patients salvaged. 26 patients, who were in grade III, underwent orchidectomy in second look exploration. TT requires emergency attention. The ischemia time of the testis is traditionally after 6 hours, and imaging or other diagnostic modality should not be a cause of delay. Early surgical exploration is modality of choice, and second look exploration after 48 hours can be more effective and salvageable in these patients."

    "abstract": "Cohen syndrome is an extremely rare autosomal recessive disorder. A 12-year-old boy with Cohen syndrome applied to a primary health care center because of severe pain in the left groin and was diagnosed with epididymo-orchitis. Despite the administered the antibiotic treatment, pain increased. Therefore, the family brought the patient to the emergency department 16 h after the first diagnosis. The patient had mild mental retardation, myopia, and craniofacial dysmorphism, which are components of Cohen syndrome. There was no blood flow on the left testicle at color Doppler ultrasonography. Further, scrotal exploration was performed because of a high risk of torsion. The left testicle was torsioned, and the color was dark blue. Revascularization could not be achieved by detorsion; left orchiectomy and right testicular fixation were then conducted. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of testicular torsion in Cohen syndrome. If a patient with this syndrome has acute groin pain, testicular torsion should be immediately ruled out with Doppler ultrasonography. These patients may not clearly and correctly express themselves because of mild mental retardation. Moreover, detailed genitourinary, particularly testicular examination may clarify the omitted pathologies and make them well known in future in this syndrome."

Recorded patient demographics included age, presenting symptoms, duration of symptoms and relevant examination findings. Three-hundred and twelve patients were included with a mean age of 15 years (range 1 day-40 years). In total, 106 patients underwent immediate scrotal exploration, and testicular torsion (TT) was found in 30 % (n = 32/106). Two-hundred and twenty-two patients were initially investigated with DUS and 16 (7.2 %) proceeded to scrotal exploration. Of this sub-group, 2/16 presented with a history <24 h and exploration was negative for TT. In comparison, 14/16 presented with a history >24 h, and DUS findings were consistent with TT. No patients with a normal DUS represented to the ED after discharge. DUS may prevent unnecessary scrotal exploration in patients presenting with acute scrotal pain and is useful for diagnosing TT in patients presenting with symptoms >24 h."

    "abstract": "The etiology of acute scrotal pain can vary from a benign process such as mild trauma, appendicular torsion, or epididymo-orchitis to an emergent process such as an incarcerated inguinal hernia, testicular torsion, or rupture. Furthermore, testicular insult often results in a reactive hydrocele that can both cloud the diagnosis and impair the physical examination. Traditionally, the acute scrotum was managed with immediate exploration, but emergency physicians and urologists have increasingly used Doppler ultrasonography to assess vascular flow, aide in the diagnosis, and ultimately guide triage of those patients who require urgent intervention. We describe the case of a 15-year-old boy who presented with 2 days of increasing testicular pain and swelling, confirmed to have a large hydrocele with compromised testicular perfusion, and was managed by emergent operative drainage and repair of a \"tension hydrocele\" with immediate return of testicular perfusion. To our knowledge, this is the first report of tension hydrocele causing intratesticular vascular compromise in a pediatric patient."

A total of 65 cases were included in our analysis. Forty-two cases were followed up for at least 3 months. Testicular tenderness was identified as the major clinical manifestation of TT, while only a few patients with TAT presented with swelling. CDS was an important diagnostic modality.

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a urological emergency and infertility is a common complication due to ischemic injury. Surgical reduction and orchiopexy is indicated, but to date there is no effective method for restoration of spermatogenesis. The effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on acute tissue injury have been demonstrated, and the abilities of paracrine support, differentiation and immune-modulation may benefit to testicular torsion-induced infertility. We investigate the therapeutic efficacy and the mechanisms of MSCs in testicular torsion-induced germ cell injury when injected locally. Six to eight-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats received surgical 720 degree torsion for 3 hours, followed by detorsion on the left testis. 20 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without or with 3 x 10(4) MSCs from human orbital fat tissues (OFSCs) were given for 10 rats, respectively, via local injection into the left testis 30 minutes before detorsion. 20 μl of PBS injection for 6 rats with surgical exposure without torsion served as sham control. Histopathology with Johnsen's score analysis, Western blot analysis for superoxide dismutase 2, Bax, Caspase-3, human insulin growth factor-1 and human stem cell factor, malondialdehyde (MDA) assay in testis and plasma, hormones level including testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) by ELISA Kits, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and fluorescence staining for P450, Sox-9 and VASA were performed. Animals were sacrificed and bilateral orchiectomy was performed 7 days after torsion-detorsion. Local injections of OFSCs prevented torsion-induced infertility judging from Johnsen's score. TUNEL assay and Western blot analysis on caspase 3 and Bax demonstrated that OFSCs prevented ischemic/reperfusion induced intrinsic apoptosis. MDA assay revealed that OFSCs significantly reduced the oxidative stress in the damaged testicular tissues. After the OFSC injection, serum testosterone secretion was increased, while the elevation of FSH triggered by testicular injury was balanced. OFSCs also produced stem cell factor in the damaged testis. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that most transplanted cells surrounded the Leydig cells. Some of transplanted cells differentiated into p450 expressing cells within 7 days. Local injection of allogenic MSCs before surgical detorsion is a simple, clinical friendly procedure to rescue torsion-induced infertility."

Ischemia reperfusion injury is usually associated with proinflammatory cytokine generation and apoptosis of germ cells in the testes. In this study we investigate the effect of ghrelin on the proinflammatory cytokines levels and germ cell apoptosis in testicular ischemia reperfusion. 45 male rats were selected for the study and randomly divided into 3 groups, each containing 15 rats. Animals in the testicular torsion and ghrelin treated groups were subjected to unilateral 720 counterclockwise testicular torsion for 1 hr and then reperfusion was allowed after detorsion for 4 hr, 1 and 7 days. The ghrelin-treated group received intraperitoneal injection of ghrelin 15min before detorsion. The expression levels of bcl-2-associated X protein and proliferating cell nuclear antigen in testicular tissue in the different groups were detected by immunohistochemical assay and tissue cytokines interleukin-1β, tumor necroses factor-α and interleukin-6 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. After being treated by ghrelin, the population of immunoreactive cells against BAX in the spermatocytes on day 7 after reperfusion significantly decreased when compared to tortion/ detortion-saline animals (p=0.024). In contrast, PCNA expression in the spermatocytes and spermatogonia were not significantly different between tortion/ detortion-ghrelin and tortion/ detortion-saline groups on both experimental days. Administration of ghrelin significantly attenuated the testicular tumor necroses factor-α and interleukin-6 levels compared with the untreated animals, but had no significant effect on the level of interleukin-1β. Ghrelin offers remarkable anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects in testicular ischemia reperfusion injury."

If left untreated, it can lead to loss of the reproductive organs. The aim of this study was to examine the role of aliskiren in testicular torsion and detorsion injuries. Rats were divided into 8 groups of 12 each, including no torsion-detorsion, no torsion-detorsion plus 200 mg/kg aliskiren orally, torsion, torsion-detorsion, torsion plus 100 mg/kg aliskiren orally, torsion plus 200 mg/kg aliskiren orally, torsion-detorsion plus 100 mg/kg aliskiren orally and torsion-detorsion plus 200 mg/kg aliskiren orally. Aliskiren was administered 30 minutes before ischemia and reperfusion, and also 24 hours before the experimental protocol in all treatment groups. Ischemia and reperfusion were each applied for 2 hours. Testicular damage decreased superoxide dismutase and glutathione, and increased malondialdehyde in the testis tissues of rats. Aliskiren administration increased superoxide dismutase and glutathione, and decreased malondialdehyde in the testis tissues. Values were measured by a biochemical autoanalyzer. In addition, this torsion-detorsion damage caused a significant increase in levels of the inflammatory cytokine and agents interleukin-1β and inducible nitric oxide synthase, as examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Aliskiren administration decreased these parameters. On pathological evaluation administration of a 200 mg/kg dose of aliskiren was found to protect the testis. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition by aliskiren caused an increase in serum renin levels and a decrease in serum angiotensin II levels. It appears that aliskiren protects the testis from ischemia-reperfusion damage by regulating inflammation and the oxidant-antioxidant balance via renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition."

    "abstract": "The most common cause of acute scrotum in prepubertal boys is torsion of the testicular or epididymal appendages. The purpose of this retrospective study was to characterize the features of these lesions as viewed on sonographic (US) and color Doppler US examination. During a 220-week period, 527 male patients 0-17 years old had been referred from the pediatric emergency department for scrotal US evaluation. Torsion of the appendix testis or appendix epididymis had been diagnosed in 19 (3.6%) patients, 3-14 years old (mean, 9.4 years); those patients became our study cohort. The clinical diagnoses in 15 of those patients had been suspected testicular torsion (n = 7), trauma (n = 4), suspected epididymitis and/or orchitis (n = 3), and suspected hydrocele (n = 1). The remaining four patients had been referred owing to nonspecific pain. None of the 19 patients had had the \"blue-dot sign\" on physical examination. In the 19 patients diagnosed with torsion of the intrascrotal appendages, color Doppler US demonstrated a round or oval avascular lesion with heterogeneous echotexture (n = 18), posterior enhancement (n = 13), and hyperemia of the surrounding structures (n = 15). All lesions (appendages) were adjacent (n = 16) or in close proximity (n = 3) to the upper pole of the testis. Fifteen of the appendages were adjacent to both the testis and the epididymis, four were adjacent to the epididymis alone, and none were adjacent to the testis alone. Owing to the close proximity of the upper pole of the testis, the epididymis, and the appendage, differentiation between testicular and epididymal appendages was not possible. Torsion of the intrascrotal appendages has a typical appearance on color Doppler US; thus, we believe that it is the method of choice for diagnosing torsion of the scrotal appendages and safely ruling out other disorders as well as avoiding unwarranted surgical intervention or antibiotic treatment."

Color Doppler ultrasound (US) is the modality of choice to differentiate testicular torsion from inflammatory conditions and can thus help in avoiding unnecessary surgical explorations. A study on 50 patients was conducted who were referred with history of acute scrotal pain to our department between January 2013 and January 2014. Trauma and scrotal mass were excluded from the study. The clinical presentation, outcome, and US results were analyzed. Color Doppler sonography yielded a positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV) of 100% each for torsion, whereas, 93.9 and 70.6% for epididymo-orchitis, respectively; a sensitivity and specificity of 100% for torsion, whereas, for epididymo-orchitis it was found to be 86.1 and 85.7%, respectively. In cases of incomplete or early torsion, some residual perfusion may be detected leading to false-negative results. We therefore conclude that color Doppler sonography can reliably rule out testicular torsion and can thus help in avoiding unnecessary surgical explorations. Hence, it can significantly improve outcome and decrease morbidity of patient. It is an accurate, rapid, nonexpensive, nonionizing, important adjunct to clinical assessment of scrotum."

The clinical data of 13 patients with testicular torsion in the inguinal canal treated between 2005 and 2013 were reviewed. Recorded patient age, whether the testes were palpable or not, side of the affected testes, the presence of hernia, ischemia time, and operation outcomes were assessed. Results. Patient age ranged from 8 to 70 months (29.15 ± 20.22). Mean ischemia time was 16.5 ± 21.3 hours. Accompanying inguinal hernia was present in 92% of the cases (12/13). Four of the thirteen patients (30.8%) were treated by orchiectomy because the necrosis was present after prolonged ischemia time. Nine patients (69.2%) were treated by single session orchidopexy. Conclusion. Torsion of testes in the inguinal canal is a rare disease, but with rapid diagnosis, affected testes can be salvaged, but the key factor is to keep this condition in mind."

This practice emanates from the difficulty on ultrasound of distinguishing salvageable testes from those that are not salvageable.

The aim of this study was to review our institutional results for surgery for testicular torsion in the neonatal period with a special focus on salvage surgery. Patient records were reviewed for all children in the age up to 30 days who were operated for testicular torsion at our hospital during the past 20 years. A total of 13 patients were included, two with bilateral affection. Emergency surgery was performed in eight cases and delayed surgery in five cases. Out of our 15 affected testes, 12 (85%) were non-viable at the time of surgery and were removed, one was fibrotic and left in place and two were salvageable. The overall frequency of salvageable testis was low, and testis was only salvaged in cases with urgent surgery at symptom recognition. Cases that presented within the first day of life resulted in a non-salvageable testis despite emergency surgery. The reason may be prenatal torsion.

Acute testicular torsion is the only true urological emergency, where delay in presentation or management can lead to loss of the affected testicle. Since prompt presentation, diagnosis and treatment are critical for testicular salvage, multiple patient and hospital specific factors may influence orchidectomy rates. Parental awareness of the sequelae of ASP may be a significant factor in delayed presentation of children to hospital. We examine the awareness among parents of the implications of ASP in this snapshot study. A prospective study was planned, and all boys between the ages of 2 and 16 years presenting to the unit with ASP and undergoing emergency scrotal exploration were considered for inclusion in the study. The accompanying parents/guardians of all these boys were asked to complete a questionnaire assessing their awareness of ASP and its potential consequences. Over a period of 26 months (July 2010 to September 2012), 76 boys were eligible for the study. The response rate was 81.6%. Only a third (30%) presented to hospital within six hours of onset of pain and just under a quarter (22%) of the cohort attended the emergency department directly. Parents overwhelmingly (96%) felt that there ought to be increased public awareness of the condition. The majority of parents questioned (n=41, 66%) did not fully appreciate the implications of ASP. This is a first snapshot study demonstrating the apparent lack of awareness among parents about the implications of ASP, which could influence the rate of testicular salvage."

The objective here was to determine whether cold weather is associated with higher incidence of testicular torsion in a tropical country, such as Brazil. Retrospective study, conducted in a tertiary and teaching hospital. Patients with acute testicular torsion confirmed by surgery between April 2006 and March 2011 were studied. Information on weather conditions at the time of symptom onset was collected. A total of 64 testicular torsion cases were identified. The months with the highest incidences of testicular torsion were June (16%), July (19%) and August (11%), which had the lowest mean temperatures, of 17.6 °C, 16.4 °C and 18.2 °C, respectively. Eleven percent of cases occurred during spring (October to December), 16% occurred in summer (January to March), 34% occurred in fall (April to June) and 39% occurred in winter (July to September). There was a significant association between the incidence of testicular torsion and the season (fall and winter), P < 0.001. Testicular torsion follows a seasonal association even in a tropical country, and is more frequent in the colder months of the year, namely fall and winter, when almost three-quarters of the cases occurred.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of PDTC to testicular torsion-detorsion (T/D) injury. Forty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were separated into four groups. A sham operation was performed in group I. In group II, torsion is performed 2 hours by 720 degree extravaginally testis. In group III, 4 h reperfusion of the testis was performed after 2 h of testicular torsion. In group IV, after performing the same surgical procedures as in group III, PDTC (100 mg/kg, intravenous's) was administered before 30 min of detorsion. The testes tissue malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) catalase (CAT) level was evaluated. Histological evaluations were performed after hematoxylin and eosin staining. Testicular tissue MDA levels were the highest in the T/D groups compared with treatment group. Administration of PDTC prevented a further increase in MDA levels. Significant decrease occurred in CAT and SOD levels in treatment group compared with the control group. The rats in the treatment group had normal testicular architecture. The results suggest that PDTC can be a potential protective agent for preventing the biochemical and histological changes related to oxidative stress in testicular injury caused by testis torsion."

Twenty-four male Wistar albino-type rats were randomly separated into three groups. To develop testicular torsion, the right testicle was rotated 720° clockwise. After five hours of rotation, reperfusion was applied for 24 hours. The control group rats (Group C) had no procedures or treatments; basal numbers were used. Intraperitoneal 25 mg/kg dexketoprofen (1 cc) (Group D) or the same volume of serum physiologic (Group SP) were given to the Group D and Group SP rats 40 minutes before and 12 hours after detorsion. Twenty-four hours after detorsion, histopathological evaluation was performed by bilateral orchiectomy. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were detected in testicular tissue and in serum. Histopathologic changes in the spermatic cells of torsioned testicles in Group D were significantly less than those of Group SP (p < 0.05). MDA levels in both testicles in Group D were similar to those of the control group. Although they were lower than Group SP, the difference was not statistically significant. Serum MDA levels were lower in Group D compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). We detected that dexketoprofen decreases I/R injury in both the torsion-formed testicle and the contralateral testicle. Thus, in patients who have urgent surgery for testicular detorsion, dexketoprofen can be preferred as an analgesic to reduce I/R injury. Further study is warranted to demonstrate this effect of dexketoprofen (Tab. 3, Fig. 1, Ref. 30)."

It represents one of the most common surgical emergencies in children often caused by testicular torsion; the diagnosis is mostly clinical but must be supported by ultrasonographic examination of the scrotal region in association with a colour Doppler study of the spermatic cord vessels and glandular parenchyma. An idiopathic scrotal hematoma is a very rare condition that can simulate it. A 3-day-old full-term baby, otherwise in good health, showed swelling and pain of the left inguinal-scrotal region. A testicular torsion was suspected, so the baby underwent an ultrasound examination of the testis and spermatic cord that showed a left scrotal hematoma with superior displacement of the didymus; the right testicle was located in the internal inguinal canal. Surgical intervention confirmed the sonographic diagnosis of left testicular hematoma and of the right cryptorchidism. Although testicular torsion is the most frequent cause of acute scrotum, the possibility of a persistent idiopathic scrotal haematoma and/or haematoma secondary to a trauma of the inguino-scrotal region, must be always taken into account. US diagnosis can avoid unnecessary emergency surgical treatment, required in case of testicular torsion."

Many cellular and molecular mechanisms are involved in ischaemia-reperfusion injury following testicular torsion. Studies have investigated the use of pharmacological agents as supportive therapy to surgical repair in order to prevent the adverse effects of testicular torsion. Numerous substances have been proposed as important in the prevention of post-ischaemia-reperfusion testicular injury.

Clinical signs such as fever, elevated C-reactive protein and positive urine dipstick test are suggestive of epididymo-orchitis/orchitis. This case study demonstrates that testicular torsion can occur at any age, and clinical suspicion should always be high in patients presenting with testicular pain and a negative urine dipstick, regardless of age. Although risk in this subgroup is low, the identification of a potentially reversible testicular abnormality should be of high priority."

Painful scrotal masses require urgent evaluation. Characteristics that suggest testicular torsion include rapid symptom onset, nausea and vomiting, high position of the testicle, and abnormal cremasteric reflex. Doppler ultrasonography or surgical exploration is required to confirm the diagnosis. Surgical repair must occur within six hours of symptom onset to reliably salvage the testicle. Epididymitis/orchitis have a slower onset and are associated with a C-reactive protein level greater than 24 mg per L (228.6 nmol per L) and increased blood flow on ultrasonography. Acute onset of pain with near normal physical examination and ultrasound findings is consistent with torsion of the testicular appendage. Testicular malignancies cause pain in 15% of cases. If ultrasonography shows an intratesticular mass, timely urology referral is indicated. Inguinal hernias are palpated separate to the testicle and can cause pain. Emergent surgery is indicated for a strangulated hernia. Hydrocele, varicocele, and scrotal skin lesions may be managed in nonurgent settings. A biopsy should be performed to rule out cancer in patients with scrotal skin lesions that are erosive, vascular, hyperkeratotic, or nonhealing, or that change color or have irregular borders."

In newborns it can occur in the postnatal period, usually within the twenty-eighth day of life, or more frequently in utero, during the descent of the testis into the scrotum. Usually its poor fixedness allows the testis an abnormal mobility inside the scrotum, configuring the framework of extravaginal torsion. On the contrary during the perinatal period a twist that takes place inside the tunica vaginalis, known as intravaginal torsion, is extremely uncommon and only few cases are well documented in the literature. Authors present a rare case of intravaginal testicular torsion occurred in perinatal period. In this situation only the early surgical exploration of the scrotum may allow the rescue of the gonad, although in rare cases. Timing of surgical treatment and need for contralateral testicular fixation remain controversial. However since the anatomical defect of the tunica vaginalis can be bilateral the surgical fixation even of the contralateral testis is important, now or later, in order to prevent any future torsion of this gonad. The authors also present a brief review of recent literature on the subject."

Testicular preservation was achieved in 39 cases of the TT group, while due to delayed referral, orchiectomy was performed in 29 cases. Thus, our testicular salvage rate was 57.5% and missed testicular torsion rate was 42.5%. It was observed that our testicular salvage rate was lower than the expected figures published in the literature.

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a twisting of the spermatic cord and its contents and is a surgical emergency affecting 3.8 per 100,000 males younger than 18 years annually. It accounts for 10% to 15% of acute scrotal disease in children, and results in an orchiectomy rate of 42% in boys undergoing surgery for testicular torsion. Prompt recognition and treatment are necessary for testicular salvage, and torsion must be excluded in all patients who present with acute scrotum. Testicular torsion is a clinical diagnosis, and patients typically present with severe acute unilateral scrotal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Physical examination may reveal a high-riding testicle with an absent cremasteric reflex. If history and physical examination suggest torsion, immediate surgical exploration is indicated and should not be postponed to perform imaging studies. There is typically a four- to eight-hour window before permanent ischemic damage occurs. Delay in treatment may be associated with decreased fertility, or may necessitate orchiectomy."

    "abstract": "Acute abdominal complaints in children are common presentations in the emergency department. The aetiology, presentation, diagnosis and management often differ from those in adults. This review was based on expert paediatric surgical experience confirmed by evidence from the literature obtained by searching PubMed and the Cochrane Library. Keywords used were the combinations of 'abdominal emergencies', 'acute abdomen' and the disorders 'acute appendicitis', 'intussusception', 'volvulus', 'Meckel's diverticulum', 'incarcerated inguinal hernia', 'testicular torsion' and 'ovarian torsion' with 'children'. Information was included from reviews, randomized clinical trials, meta-analyses, and prospective and retrospective cohort studies. Presentation and symptoms of abdominal emergencies, especially in young children, vary widely, which renders recognition of the underlying disorder and treatment challenging. Critically targeted imaging techniques are becoming increasingly important in obtaining the correct diagnosis without unnecessary delay. Minimally invasive techniques have become the method of choice for the diagnosis and treatment of many abdominal emergencies in children. Knowledge of abdominal disorders in childhood, their specific presentation, diagnosis and treatment facilitates management of children with acute abdomen in emergency departments. Imaging and minimally invasive techniques are becoming increasingly important in the diagnosis of acute abdomen in children. Urgent operation remains the cornerstone of therapy for most acute abdominal disorders."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is an emergent condition requiring prompt surgical intervention to avoid permanent testicular compromise and death. As its symptoms overlap with other disease processes, diagnosis is sometimes difficult. When considering the presenting symptoms, one must be careful not to ignore unusual causes of torsion and misdiagnose the patient. In this case report we describe an unusual etiology of testicular torsion (traumatic) with an atypical patient presentation (mildly painful) which presented many obstacles before proper diagnosis and treatment."

    "abstract": "Acute scrotal pain, once diagnosed, can be treated appropriately with either conservative or surgical measures. The complexity lies in the use of history, clinical examination and investigations in a restricted time frame, to identify the appropriate management path. To evaluate the literature regarding important and common differentials of acute scrotal pain with the intent to enable primary care doctors to appropriately assess and manage the acutely painful scrotum. Since there is no single feature in the history, examination or investigation that is pathognomonic in diagnosing acute scrotal pain, the triad together is pivotal in its clinical evaluation. If there is any suspicion of testicular torsion, a prompt referral to a surgeon with relevant experience or to the emergency department may salvage the testis. Epididymitis and torsion of the appendix testis may be managed conservatively once testicular torsion has been ruled out."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a urological emergency that leads to serious testicular damage and male infertility. We performed this study to identify specific proteins that are differentially expressed in response to testicular torsion and detorsion-induced ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury. Adult male rats were divided into two groups: a sham-operated group and a testicular I-R group. Testicular torsion was induced by rotating the left testis 720° in a clockwise direction for 1 hr, and then, detorsion was performed for 24 hr. After this testicular tissues were collected, protein analysis was performed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and Western blot analyses. Testicular I-R injury resulted in serious histopathologic damage to the germinal cells in the seminiferous tubules and increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells in testicular tissue. Specific protein spots with a greater than 2.5-fold change in intensity between the sham-operated and testicular I-R groups were identified by mass spectrometry. Among these proteins, levels of peroxiredoxin 6, thioredoxin, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydrolase isozyme L5 and zinc finger AN1-type domain 3 were decreased in the testicular I-R group compared to the sham-operated group. Moreover, Western blot analysis clearly showed the decrease of these proteins in the testicular I-R group. These proteins have spermatogenesis and anti-oxidative functions. These findings suggest that testicular I-R results in cell death due to altered expression of several proteins with spermatogenesis and anti-oxidation functions."

    "abstract": "The objective was to assess whether testicular torsion is associated with low testicular tissue saturation of oxygen (StO2 ) as measured by transscrotal near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and to compare the differences in NIRS values between testicles of the same patient, both in patients with testicular torsion and in healthy controls. This was an observational study of healthy controls and patients with surgically confirmed testicular torsion who were recruited from males under 30 years of age presenting to the emergency department (ED). The hypothesis was that the difference in NIRS values for the control's two testicles would be zero, and that the difference between the torsed and healthy testicles on an individual patient would not be zero. Based on animal data, the study was powered to detect an absolute difference of StO2 of 47%. The mean StO2 for the left control patients' testicles was 73.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 68.0% to 79.1%) and the mean StO2 for the right controls' testicles for controls was 73.6% (95% CI = 66.9% to 80.4%; n = 17). The absolute difference in NIRS StO2 for left minus right for each individual was 3.5% (95% CI = 1.8% to 5.4%), which was significantly different (p = 0.0007), and refuted the hypothesis that there was no significant difference in StO2 between left and right testes in healthy patients. In the testicular torsion group, the torsed side had a mean StO2 of 82.8% (95% CI = 68.7% to 96.9%), and the contralateral nontorsed testes had a mean of 85.8% (95% CI = 72.3% to 99.3%). The mean StO2 difference, nontorsed minus torsed was 3.0% (range = -1% to 9%, 95% CI = -2% to 8%; p = 0.174), refuting the hypothesis that torsed testes would demonstrate significantly lower values for StO2 . While pilot animal investigations support a potential role for transscrotal NIRS for the detection of testicular torsion, this first clinical translation of animal findings reveals that the investigated, transcutaneous, reflectance geometry NIRS device failed to demonstrate symmetric oxygenation of left and right testes in healthy controls and also failed to demonstrate depressed tissue saturation of oxygen values in patients with confirmed testicular torsion. While limited by a small sample size, other problems such as inability to calibrate depth of measurement of StO2 may have led to falsely elevated readings in patients with torsion."

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Pausinystalia macroceras (PM) bark extract on sperm quality and serum testosterone levels in testicular torsion in a rat model. Sixty-five (65) mature male Wistar rats apportioned randomly into four experimental groups of A to C; were further divided into four subgroups according to duration of torsion. Group D were the normal regular rats. Each group/subgroup comprised five rats. Testis maintained in the torted position (T) for 1, 2, 3 and 4 hr in Group A (subgroups: AT1+PM, AT2+PM, AT3+PM, and AT4+PM). Group B (sub- groups: B1+PM, B2+PM, B3+PM, B4+PM) were sham-operated animals, which did not undergo torsion and served as the sham control group. Group C subgroups: CT1, CT2, CT3 and CT4 were torted as in A. All animals (except groups C and D) were treated by PM extract (0.1 g/kg b.w. per day) for 56 days. Group D rats were fed distilled water. Serum testosterone concentrations and sperm quality (motility and count) were measured. Analyses of variance with Scheffe's post-hoc test were carried out on the data. PM extract had a positive effect (significant; p < 0.5) on the sperm count and motility in rats with testicular torsion compared to those not receiving the extract. There was also an increase in serum testosterone levels in the former groups. Treatment of rats following testicular torsion result to the enhancement of sperm production in comparison with untreated rats."

Hospital transfer may be a source of treatment delay in a condition where delays increase likelihood of orchiectomy. We used a retrospective cohort of Californian males with ICD-9/CPT-defined torsion from inpatient, emergency department (ED), and ambulatory surgery center (ASC) data. Logistic regression assessed predictors of orchiectomy. Predictors of orchiectomy were ages <1 year (OR 19.2, 95% CI 6.3-58.9), 1-9 years (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.4-5.2), and ≥40 years (OR 6.6, 95% CI 3.1-13.9) (vs. masked age). Treatment at mid-volume (vs. high-volume) facilities was associated with lower odds of orchiectomy (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.7). Rural location, non-private insurance, and hospital transfer were associated with orchiectomy on univariate but not multivariate analysis. During 2008-2010, 2794 subjects experienced torsion (average incidence 5.08 per 100,000 males yearly). Encounters occurred in ASCs (55%), inpatient facilities (36%), and EDs (9%). 60% of subjects were privately insured, 2% experienced hospital transfer, and 31% underwent orchiectomy. Our census found that most cases of testicular torsion were treated in outpatient settings. Hospital transfer was not associated with orchiectomy."

Patient's scrotal examination was misleading because both testes were retracted. His cremasteric reflex was negative bilaterally. Scrotal ultrasound findings were consistent with the diagnosis of the left testicular torsion. An examination under anaesthesia revealed high riding and oblique position of the left testicle, but the position of the right testicle was unremarkable. The patient underwent an emergency left hemiscrotal exploration and untwisting of the left testicle. The right hemi-scrotal exploration revealed a 540° clock-wise right testicular torsion. The case demonstrates the importance of bilateral hemi-scrotal exploration in a patient presenting with acute testicular pain due to a testicular torsion. Bilateral scrotal exploration is mandatory not only for diagnostic but also for treatment purposes."

    "abstract": "Penile and scrotal emergencies are uncommon, but when they do occur, urgent or emergent diagnosis and treatment are necessary. Emergent conditions of the male genitalia are primarily infectious, traumatic, or vascular. Infectious conditions, such as epididymitis and epididymo-orchitis, are well evaluated at ultrasonography (US), and their key findings include heterogeneity and hyperemia. Pyocele and abscess may also be seen at US. Fournier gangrene is best evaluated at computed tomography, which depicts subcutaneous gas. Vascular conditions, such as testicular torsion, infarction, penile Mondor disease, and priapism, are well evaluated at duplex Doppler US. The key imaging finding of testicular torsion and infarction is a lack of blood flow in the testicle or a portion of the testicle. Penile Mondor disease is characterized by a lack of flow to and noncompressibility of the superficial dorsal vein of the penis. Clinical examination and history are usually adequate for diagnosis of priapism, but Doppler US may help confirm the diagnosis. Traumatic injuries of the penis and scrotum are initially imaged with US, which depicts whether the penile corpora and testicular seminiferous tubules are contained by the tunicae albuginea; herniation of contents and discontinuity of the tunica albuginea indicate rupture. In some cases, magnetic resonance imaging may be performed because of its ability to directly depict discontinuity of the tunica albuginea. Radiologists must closely collaborate with emergency physicians, surgeons, and urologists to quickly and efficiently diagnose or rule out emergent conditions of the male genitalia to facilitate prompt and appropriate treatment."

From 1 January 1999 to 30 July 2005, 870 patients from a single institution were diagnosed with epididymitis. A total of 480 men met the inclusion criteria for acute epididymitis. Scrotal ultrasound was included as a part of the diagnostic evaluation in 42.7% of men. Ultrasound reports were available for review in 187 cases. Information regarding patient demographics, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment was reviewed. Ultrasound findings consistent with epididymitis were identified in 69.3% of men. The four most commonly reported irregularities were scrotal wall thickening (84.2%), abnormal epididymal echotexture (74%), increased epididymal vascularity (72.9%), and an enlarged epididymis (71.5%). Scrotal ultrasound was performed in 67% men under age 20 compared to 36% men between ages 30 and 69. Patients presenting to the Emergency Department underwent sonographic evaluation 57% of the time versus 17.2% men presenting to primary care physicians (P < 0.001). Ninety-five per cent (194/204) of patients who underwent CDUS were treated with antibiotics compared to 96% (263/275) of those who did not receive an ultrasound (P = 0.78). CDUS can be helpful in patients with a potential diagnosis of testicular torsion, however, the use of CDUS as a diagnostic adjunct in the evaluation of epididymitis is of limited value. Treatment patterns and antibiotic usage were not significantly altered by ultrasound findings at this institution."

Retrospective review of surgical and emergency department ultrasound records for boys from 1 month to 17 years old presenting with acute scrotal pain from 2008 to 2011 was performed. Clinical symptoms, ultrasound and surgical findings, and diagnoses were recorded. Surgical results and follow-up were used as the reference standard. Of 342 patients who presented to the emergency department with acute scrotum, 35 had testicular torsion. Of 266 ultrasound examinations performed, 29 boys had torsion confirmed by surgery. The false-positive rate for ultrasound was 2.6%, and there were no false-negative findings. Mean times from presentation at the emergency department to ultrasound and surgery were 209.4 and 309.4 minutes, respectively. Of the torsed testicles, 69% were salvageable. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for testicular torsion were 100%, 97.9%, and 98.1%, respectively. Sonographic heterogeneity was seen in 80% of nonviable testes at surgery and 58% of patients with viable testes (p = 0.41). Sudden-onset scrotal pain (88%), abnormal position (86%), and absent cremasteric reflex (91%) were most prevalent in torsion patients. Color Doppler ultrasound is accurate and sensitive for diagnosis of torsion in the setting of acute scrotum. Despite heterogeneity on preoperative ultrasound, many testes were considered to be salvageable at surgery. The salvage rate of torsed testes was high."

This was a prospective cohort study of a convenience sample of newborn to 21-year-old males evaluated for acute (72 hours or less) scrotal pain at an urban children's hospital emergency department (ED). A pediatric emergency medicine fellow or attending physician documented history and examination findings on a standardized data collection form. The study investigators used ultrasound (US), operative reports, or clinical follow-up to identify patients who had testicular torsion. Pearson's chi-square test and odds ratios (OR) were used to identify factors associated with the diagnosis of testicular torsion. The authors also used a recursive partitioning model to create a low-risk decision tool for testicular torsion. Of the 450 eligible patients, 228 (51%) were enrolled, with a mean (± SD) age of 9.9 (± 4.1) years, including 21 (9.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.8% to 13.7%) with testicular torsion. The derived clinical decision tool consisted of three variables: horizontal or inguinal testicular lie (OR = 18.17, 95% CI = 6.2 to 53.2), nausea or vomiting (OR = 5.63, 95% CI = 2.08 to 15.22), and age 11 to 21 years (OR = 3.9, 95% CI = 1.27 to 11.97). These variables had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI = 98% to 100%) and negative predictive value of 100% (95% CI = 98% to 100%) for the diagnosis of testicular torsion. Based on a decision tool derived with recursive partitioning, study patients with all of the following characteristics had no risk of testicular torsion: normal testicular lie, lack of nausea or vomiting, and age 0 to 10 years. Future research should focus on externally validating this tool to optimize emergent evaluation when testicular torsion is likely, while minimizing routine sonographic evaluation when patients are unlikely to have a serious condition requiring immediate management."

While the magnitude of testicular torsion is not known it has been identified as a cause of male infertility. Testicular loss in Africa is directly related to delay in surgery and the referral patterns at the point of first contact with health workers. This paper sets out to demonstrate the importance of the patient's age in the diagnosis of testicular torsion. A surgical audit was made of patients records collected over the last 30 years, for presentation of testicular related symptoms and analyzed to identify changes in the patterns of diagnosis over time and in different countries. There were 305 records found, for patients with an age range of 9-56 years. There were 195/305 (64%) with orchitis and 110/305 (36%) with testicular torsion. Testicular torsion is more common under the age of 18 years while orchitis was more common after 18 years of age (rho=-0.834, p value>0.001 one tailed). This paper supports the development of educational interventions that promote the use of age in a simple diagnostic rule of the thumb for communities and lower cadre health workers in low resource settings."

We assessed whether the type of consultation (first consultation in our center or secondary transfer from a peripheral hospital or primary care practice), distance from home to hospital, and duration of pain had an impact on the orchiectomy rate. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients under 15years of age suffering from acute scrotal pain who had surgical exploration between January 2007 and January 2010 in our center. Patient demographics, transfer status, time to consultation in our center, time to surgery, operative findings and clinical outcome were reviewed. Of the 76 patients with acute scrotal pain in whom surgical exploration was performed, 59 had acute spermatic cord torsion, 16 had torsion of the testicular appendage, and 1 had orchitis. In patients with acute spermatic cord torsion, the median age was 13 years (range: 0.18-14.97). In patients with acute spermatic cord torsion, 32 came straight to our center (direct admission group, 54.2%), and 27 (45.8%) came after a prior consultation out of side the center (transfer group). The median journey was 19km (range: 2.5-113) in the direct admission group and 44km (range: 2.5-393) in the transfer group (P=0.0072). The median time between pain onset and consultation at our center was 4.3h (range: 0.5-48) in the direct admission group, and 11h (range: 2-48) in the transfer group (P=0.6139). The median time between admission at our center and surgery was 2.5h, with no difference between the 2 groups (P=0.8789). The orchiectomy rate was 25% in the direct admission group and 14.8% in the transfer group (P=0.5177). In children who underwent orchiectomy, the duration of pain was consistently over 6h. The duration of pain was greater in patients with orchiectomy (12h [range: 1-72]) than in patients without orchiectomy (12h [range: 6-48]; P=0.0001). In this study, the orchiectomy rate depended on the duration of pain but not on transfer status. Acute scrotal pain must lead to surgical exploration as soon as possible, requiring close collaboration between peripheral hospitals, primary care physicians, and referral centers."

Respondents were asked about use of ultrasound, timing of surgery, incision, and management of the contralateral testicle. A case with a non-palpable testicle and blind ending vessels was also presented. We had 121 respondents. In a neonate with prenatal torsion, 34% percent would operate immediately, 26% urgently within 72 h, 28% electively and 12% would not explore; 93% would perform a contralateral orchiopexy. In a neonate with postnatal torsion, 93% would operate immediately, 5% urgently, 1% electively and 1% would not explore; 96% would perform a contralateral orchiopexy. In both cases, 75% would use a scrotal incision and 25% would use an inguinal incision. When presented with bilateral prenatal torsion, 90% would operate immediately, 1% urgently, 2% electively and 7% would not operate. In the case of a non-palpable testicle with blind ending vessels 28% would perform a contralateral orchiopexy, 12% would explore the ipsilateral canal for a \"nubbin\", 56% would perform no intervention and 4% would perform some other form of management. We documented variability of timing for intervention of prenatal torsion and confirmed that most view postnatal torsion as a surgical emergency. Most perform a contralateral orchiopexy for prenatal torsion despite the fact that most cases are extravaginal. The surgical approach via a scrotal incision appears to be preferred at this time."

Overall, 36 patients (23%) with acute scrotal pain (50% of patients in the group with confirmed testicular torsion at exploration) required orchidectomy. This study supports the practice of immediate surgical exploration with a clinical suspicion of testicular torsion in a paediatric population."

    "abstract": "Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is an imaging technique with various indications, most of which refer to scheduled examinations. However, CEUS can also be performed under urgent conditions for the investigation of many different clinical questions. This article reviews basic physics of ultrasound contrast agents and examines the commonest urgent clinical applications of CEUS. These include, among others, abdominal solid organ trauma and infarcts, scrotal and penile pathology and blood vessel imaging. Patients can be examined with a very short time delay at their bedside, without exposure to ionising radiation or risk of anaphylactic reaction and renal failure, while contraindications are minimal. CEUS technique is described for various urgent indications and imaging examples from our department's experience are presented. Safety matters and limitations of CEUS are also mentioned. Teaching Points • Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can be performed urgently for various clinical applications. • Abdominal indications include solid organ trauma and infarcts. • CEUS in abdominal organ trauma correlates well with CT and can replace it for patient follow-up. • CEUS images testicular torsion, infection and infarction, as well as testicular and penile trauma. • Blood vessels can be assessed with CEUS for obstruction, aneurysm, thrombosis and dissection."

    "title": "Ovarian torsion: diagnosis of inclusion mandates earlier intervention.",
    "abstract": "The treatment of ovarian torsion (OT) is often delayed because of diagnostic uncertainty and dependence on radiologic confirmation. In contrast, when testicular torsion (TT) is suspected, diagnosis and management are expedited despite lack of certainty, and operative exploration is not delayed by radiologic investigations. We compared the management of torsion in both sexes to define a better clinical pathway for suspected OT. A 2.5-year review of the Pediatric Health Information System database was performed to determine the incidence of TT and OT at large children's hospitals. A 10-year retrospective review of children (0-19 years) diagnosed with TT or OT at a single academic center was performed to identify differences in diagnosis and management and determine the impact on gonadal salvage rates. The incidence of TT was comparable with OT in the Pediatric Health Information System database (0.03% vs 0.02%). A total of 158 patients with TT and 90 patients with OT were managed at our center with a median age of 12 years in both groups. Boys presented earlier after the onset of pain (36 vs 72 hours, P < .0001) and were imaged more quickly (0.77 vs 1.86 hours, P < .0001). Time to operating room (OR) was also shorter for TT (2.3 vs 6.3 hours, P < .0001). The salvage rate for TT was 30.3% vs 14.4% for OT (P < .01). Girls with suspected OT waited 2.5 times as long for diagnostic imaging and 2.7 times as long to be taken to the operating room. In addition, the gonadal salvage rate was significantly worse for girls compared with boys with TT. More urgent intervention for OT, with liberal use of diagnostic laparoscopy and without reliance on a definitive diagnosis by imaging, should be considered in girls with lower abdominal pain."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency requiring prompt intervention. Although clinical diagnosis is recommended, scrotal ultrasound is frequently ordered, delaying treatment. We created a scoring system to diagnose testicular torsion, decreasing the indication for ultrasound. We prospectively evaluated 338 patients with acute scrotum, of whom 51 had testicular torsion. Physical examination was performed by a urologist, and all patients underwent scrotal ultrasound. Univariate analysis and logistic regression were performed, and a scoring system for risk stratification of torsion was created. Retrospective validation was performed with 2 independent data sets. The scoring system consisted of testicular swelling (2 points), hard testicle (2), absent cremasteric reflex (1), nausea/vomiting (1) and high riding testis (1). Cutoffs for low and high risk were 2 and 5 points, respectively. Ultrasound would be indicated only for the intermediate risk group. In the prospective data set 69% of patients had low, 19% intermediate and 11.5% high risk. Negative and positive predictive values were 100% for cutoffs of 2 and 5, respectively (specificity 81%, sensitivity 76%). Retrospective validation in 1 data set showed 66% of patients at low, 16% intermediate and 17% high risk. Negative and positive predictive values for cutoffs of 2 and 5 were 100% (specificity 97%, sensitivity 54%). The second retrospective data set included only torsion cases, none of which was misdiagnosed by the scoring system. This scoring system can potentially diagnose or rule out testicular torsion in 80% of cases, with high positive and negative predictive values for selected cutoffs. Ultrasound orders would be decreased to 20% of acute scrotum cases. Prospective validation of this scoring system is necessary."

A retrospective analysis was conducted in 71 patients with testicular torsion who were treated in our hospital from October 2007 to April 2011. The age of the patients ranged from 16 days to 34 years. All the patients had unilateral testicular torsion, which took place on the left side in 43 cases and on the right side in 28 cases. The course of the disease varied between three hours to 30 days. Post-operative follow-up was conducted until October 2011. Items examined included signs and symptoms at their first clinical visit, ultrasound findings, treatment in emergency surgery, and post-operative follow-up. In this study, the 71 patients were diagnosed with testicular torsion by color Doppler sonography, 7 had testicular fixation, 63 patients received orchiectomy, while 1 patient did not undergo surgery due to pressure from family members. Post-operative follow-up showed that the one patient's testicle, which had been reserved, atrophied, while all the other survived. No recurrence was found during the follow-up visits. It is concluded that an early diagnosis and surgery is important in improving the survival rate of testicular torsion, and the diagnosis and treatment by the first attending clinician is of critical importance."

A child with those symptoms should be looked on as an emergency sign requiring emergency surgical exploration as a testicular torsion. Testicular torsion represents a surgical emergency because the likelihood of testicular salvage diminishes with the duration of torsion. Therefore, we must act quickly to identify this condition in any patient who presents with an acute scrotum. The history, physical examination and patient age can provide important clues as to the exact cause of acute scrotal pain. Age is a key factor since many conditions responsible for acute scrotum commonly occur in certain age groups. Moreover, imaging is used more routinely to identify accurate diagnosis."

He was previously investigated abroad with an ultrasound scan showing a homogenous mass posterior to the left testis. Subsequent CT was unremarkable. As there was no clinical suspicion of malignancy, a scrotal exploration was performed. During scrotal exploration, the left testicular mass appeared to be a supernumerary testis, which shared the same tunica albuginea. Histology has confirmed the diagnosis. Polyorchidism is an extremely rare congenital anomaly, and can be associated with hydrocele, testicular torsion or rarely malignancy. Leung has classified polyorchidism in four types. This case has been described as type 2; the supernumerary testis shares the epididymis and the vas deferens of the other testis. Treatment can either be conservative or surgical excision. However, if the supernumerary testis is asymptomatic, with negative tumour markers and radiological findings, surgery can be avoided."

Patients operated upon for suspected torsion of the testis at Trans Ekulu Hospital Enugu over a 10-year period (1993-2003) were studied. The intervals between the onset of scrotal pain and presentation at the hospital were recorded. The duration of scrotal pain, findings on examination of the scrotum, time of starting surgical operation, and the number of viable testes seen intraoperatively were documented. Twenty-two patients were found to have undergone emergency scrotal exploration and their ages ranged from 10 to 38 years with a mean of 22.7 years. Eight of these patients came within 3 hours of onset of scrotal pain, one patient came within the 6 hours, and the rest came late. These patients were operated upon shortly after arrival at the hospital. Sixteen patients (72.7%) had testicular torsion, 12 testes were viable, and 4 nonviable. Majority of our patients presented reasonably early. Those who had testicular loss came late. However, some who came late still had viable testes."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on reversing the damaging consequences of TT-induced IRI by examining its inhibitory effects on the expression of inflammatory and apoptosis mediators in a unilateral TT rat model. Eighteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 3 groups. Group 1 underwent a sham operation of the left testis under general anesthesia. Group 2 underwent ischemia for 1h followed by 4h reperfusion in the presence of saline. The third group was similar to group 2, however, EGCG (50 mg/kg) was injected i.p. 30 min after ischemia induction. The in vivo protective effect of EGCG was tested by measuring testicular levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β by ELISA and mRNA expression of iNOS, MCP-1, p53, Bax, Bcl-2 and survivin by real-time PCR. Also, testicular morphological changes and damage to spermatogenesis were evaluated using H&E staining and Johnsen's scoring system, respectively. EGCG treatment improved testicular structures in the ipsilateral testis, markedly inhibited germ cell apoptosis (GCA) and significantly decreased testicular cytokine levels. In addition, EGCG was able to down regulate the mRNA expression of iNOS, MCP-1 and pro-apoptosis genes in favor of cell survival. For the first time we show that in vivo EGCG treatment rescued the torsed testes from IRI-induced inflammation, GCA and damage to spermatogenesis thus suggesting a new preventive approach to inhibiting the inflammatory and apoptotic consequences of TT-induced IRI."

Diagnosis of testicular torsion is challenging in emergency conditions and frequently ends with surgical exploration. In this study, 9 male 8-month-old Wistar albino rats weighing an average of 400 g were used. A transverse incision on the upper scrotum was done and the right testis was torsed with a 720° medial rotation. The other testis of each rat was used as the control or sham group. In the sham group, the testicle was moved out of the body but no torsion was applied before repositioning into the scrotum. Transmission of continuous-wave light through all testes at wavelengths of 660 nm and 940 nm were measured. The ratio of the average intensities of the transmitted light of both wavelengths--660 nm to 940 nm--was used as a parameter to diagnose testis torsion. The ratios were significantly different (P = .001) between the torsion group and control group. Our noninvasive technique measuring attenuation of dual wavelengths in transmission geometry across the testis has the ability to distinguish between the testis with and without torsion on the basis of a threshold value of the ratio."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion or torsion of the spermatic cord is a surgical emergency in which misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment can lead to male infertility. Events occurring during testicular torsion and detorsion are representative of an ischemia-reperfusion injury observed in other organs. The two most important factors determining testicular damage are the degree of twisting and the early onset of a surgical treatment to counter-rotate both testis and spermatic cord for inducing reperfusion. The damage from reperfusion is more severe than that induced by ischemia and several mechanisms are implicated in the development of testicular damage following torsion and detorsion. However, these mechanisms have not yet been fully clarified and, as a consequence, there is still a strong need to identify specific pharmacological treatment to limit the damage triggered by the reperfusion procedures. Ischemia and reperfusion of testis result in elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), activate mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PPARβ/δ receptor, induce transcription factors and growth factors including NF-κB and VEGF, trigger apoptotic machinery and induce several inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-1β . This pathological cascade is responsible for the testicular atrophy, decreased blood flow and impaired spermatogenesis. Several pharmacological approaches have been characterized as promising therapeutic agents for the management of testicular torsion and may be useful to ameliorate the sequel of this disease."

    "abstract": "To investigate the protective effect of honokiol, a phytochemical used in traditional medicine, on testicular injury after torsion/detorsion (T/D) in a rat model. Testicular torsion is a medical emergency that can cause impairment of semen quality and permanent testicular atrophy or loss. Male Wistar rats were randomized to each time point of each group (n = 6/time point/group). After 2 hours of torsion, the testes were counter-rotated to the natural position. The rats in each group underwent a sham operation, T/D, or T/D with honokiol treatment (5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally, immediately before detorsion). Bilateral orchiectomy was performed at 6 and 24 hours and 3 months after detorsion. The testes were examined histologically. Apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum stress were detected by Western blot. Histologic examination revealed that testicular T/D induced acute injury after 6 and 24 hours, and spermatogenesis was decreased at 3 months of follow-up. At 24 hours after T/D, increases were found in the activation of apoptosis-related molecules [poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspases 3 and 7], and the expression levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated molecules (phosphorylated-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit α and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein). These increases were significantly reversed with honokiol treatment. Furthermore, honokiol effectively reversed the inhibition of spermatogenesis in testes treated with T/D for 3 months. The results of our study have shown that the endoplasmic reticulum stress-related apoptotic pathway is involved in testicular injury after testicular T/D. It remains to be determined whether alterations in this pathway would have a protective affect against reperfusion damage."

The subjects are consecutive patients seen by ED physicians from January 1, 1996, to December 31, 2009. The authors identified visits with testicular torsion using International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision codes. We then determined the number of testicular torsion visits by month, correcting for the total number of days over the study period in each month. We compared the corrected number of visits for the winter (December-February) compared with the summer (June-August) using the Student t test, with α set at 0.05. We also calculated these visits for the older and younger half of the patients. Finally, we determined the correlation between mean monthly testicular torsion visits and ambient temperatures. Of the 8,545,979 visits in the database, 768 (0.009%) had an ED diagnosis of testicular torsion. The median age was 15.5 years (interquartile range, 11.7-20.8 years). We found that testicular torsion visits were 39% (95% confidence interval, 24%-57%) more likely in the winter compared with the summer, and this was similar when the older and younger half of the patients were analyzed separately. The correlation coefficient between mean monthly testicular torsion visits and ambient temperature was r = 0.54 (P = 0.006).

A survey of consultant paediatric surgeons and urologists working in the United Kingdom and Ireland was conducted to ascertain views to guide best practice. A total of 148 questionnaires were mailed, of which 110 were returned (74% response rate). Of these, 60 (54.5%) surgeons considered NTT secondary to torsion of the spermatic cord and 8 (7.2%) thought primary vascular infarction of the testis responsible. Twelve (10.9%) use Doppler ultrasound to guide management and exclude tumour. Eighty-two surgeons (74.5%) explore the scrotum, and 59 (71.9%) perform ipsilateral orchidectomy and contralateral orchidopexy of the \"healthy\" testis. Few surgeons undertake emergent exploration. Only 11 (10%) surgeons have ever found a viable testis. Seven (6.4%) cases of synchronous NTT were reported. Twenty-four (21.8%) surgeons do not perform contralateral orchidopexy with concerns of damaging a healthy testis. Orchidopexy is favoured by 89 surgeons, with 46 (52%) using nonabsorbable suture fixation and 28 (31.4%) creating a sutureless extradartos pouch. In boys later found to have a \"solitary scrotal testis\" and a contralateral testicular remnant, 38 (36.5%) of 104 would always \"pex\" the testis to avert anorchia. Surgeons' opinions with NTT in the United Kingdom and Ireland remain diverse. Strong argument can be made for scrotal exploration with/without contralateral orchidopexy. Parents should be counselled on the merits of varied strategies to gain better understanding of the long-term outcomes for their male child."

Evidence suggests that the management for each of these may be different. While management of testicular torsion in the adolescent is universally agreed upon, the diagnosis can sometimes be difficult to make.

Ischaemia was induced manually by rotating the rat testis to 720 degrees clockwise and counter rotating for reperfusion. The testes were fixed in Bouin's fluid and processed for histopathological examination. A significant decrease in the standard tubular diameter and epithelial height was observed in Group III rats compared to those in Groups I and II. However, the seminiferous tubules in Group IV rats showed recovery in the standard tubular diameter and epithelial height when compared with the untreated control groups. The results showed that vitamin E, when administered before torsion of the spermatic cord in rats, provided significant protection against acute testicular torsion and detorsion injury."

Twelve rats subjected to 60-minute ischemia following 720° testicular torsion were divided into two groups for IVM or OPS imaging examinations of the microcirculatory network of the testis at 60, 120, 180, and 240 minutes after reestablishment of perfusion. Significant microcirculatory failure was demonstrated after I/R in both groups. The absolute values of the microcirculatory parameters recorded with the OPS and IVM imaging methods did not differ statistically. The microcirculatory disturbances are present during the later phases of testicular torsion. OPS imaging technique represents an accurate noninvasive method to detect physiologic and pathophysiologic changes in the microcirculation of the testis."

In order to clarify the issue the authors reviewed the literature and found 18 case series of NTT, containing 268 operated cases suitable for analysis. This paper reviews the literature on NTT specifically regarding salvage rates and timing/necessity of surgery. Its primary aim is to produce an overall salvage rate in the operated group. Overall salvage rate was 8.96%, 24 testes. When operation is specified as an emergency, salvage may be as high as 21.7%. While salvage of a testis torted at birth is rare, it is reported. Early asynchronous torsion is also rare but reported. Worryingly, bilateral torsion can present with unilateral signs.Given these findings, we would suggest early surgery with fixation of the contralateral side."

We highlight the role of scrotal exploration in neonates diagnosed with bilateral asynchronous testicular torsion. We reviewed the clinical experience from 2000 to present of 2 senior pediatric urologists to identify cases of bilateral perinatal testicular torsion. Asynchronous torsion was identified by the varying physical findings of each testicle at exploration. A literature review was done to evaluate the evolving management of perinatal testicular torsion. Six cases of bilateral perinatal torsion were identified since 2000. In 3 of the 6 cases extravaginal torsion of the contralateral testis was incidentally identified at surgical exploration. All 3 testes had normal Doppler flow before exploration. Testicular salvage was not successful in the 2 patients with bilaterally absent blood flow on newborn ultrasound. The 3 cases of incidentally diagnosed contralateral torsion and 1 of preoperatively diagnosed contralateral torsion were successfully salvaged. Thus, 4 of 6 patients with bilateral torsion were left with 1 viable testis. Physical examination findings and radiography can be inaccurate to assess the contralateral testis in males born with prenatal torsion. We have adopted the strategy of emergent surgical exploration in cases of prenatal torsion. Using this approach anorchia was minimized in patients with bilateral asynchronous torsion."

However, we have noted an increasing use of Doppler ultrasound (US) as an adjunctive tool in the evaluation of patients with acute scrotal pain. This study aimed to retrospectively review the presentation of patients with acute scrotal pain to a tertiary ED and the use of ultrasound in the assessment of acute scrotal pain. An explicit chart review was performed including all patients presenting to an adult tertiary ED between 2003 and 2008 with acute scrotal pain. The timing of presentation, initial assessment, review by the Urology team and the use of US were recorded. The diagnosis recorded at hospital discharge was the primary end point, while follow-up at outpatient clinic or private urologist rooms was used as a secondary end point. There were 329 patients with acute scrotal pain during the study period, with 294 patients included in the study. Of these, 173 (58.8%) had a US scan performed in the ED. There were 44 (15.0%) patients who underwent scrotal exploration, with 19 having a prior US. There was a significant increase in the use of US over the study period. Colour-flow duplex Doppler ultrasonography appeared to play an increasing role in the assessment for patients presenting with acute testicular pain. Rapid and more reliable assessments of these patients may be possible through greater education of emergency personnel in ultrasonography techniques."

We performed a nationwide search of the WESTLAW legal database for filed lawsuits involving EPs and US. WESTLAW covers all state and federal lawsuits dating back to 1939. Using an electronic search feature, all states were searched using emergency and US as key words. The database automatically accounts for different variants on US such as sonography. An attorney who is also boarded in and practices emergency medicine, as well as an emergency US expert, reviewed returned cases. Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate the data. Using the search criteria and excluding obvious radiology suits, 659 cases were returned and reviewed. There were no cases of EPs being sued for performance or interpretation of point-of-care US. There was one case alleging EP failure to perform point-of-care US and diagnose an ectopic before it ruptured. This case was won by the defense. There were no cases against EPs for common causes of radiology and obstetric litigation including sexual assault during endovaginal US. Cases of missed testicular torsion on US were frequent in the emergency setting but none linked EP US. Only one case filed against EPs over the last 2 decades was identified, it was over failure to perform US. Most frequent litigations against radiologists and obstetricians are unlikely to be duplicated in the emergency department, and future litigations may also come from EP failure to perform point-of-care US."

    "abstract": "Urgent surgical exploration of the scrotum of a child or teenager who presents with a painful and swollen testicle is paramount if testicular torsion is not to be missed. It is extremely rare for a non-scrotal pathology to present with acute scrotal signs. Here we present such a rare case and emphasize the importance of being aware of this potential clinical pitfall. A 16-year-old Caucasian man presented as a surgical emergency with a five to six hour history of a painful, red, and swollen right hemiscrotum. He also complained of vague lower abdominal pain, vomiting, and watery diarrhea. He had a temperature of 38.5°C and a tender, red, and swollen right hemiscrotum. The right testicle appeared elevated. He was mildly tender in his central and upper abdomen and less so in the lower abdomen. No convincing localizing abdominal signs were noted. He had an increased white cell count (15 × 109/L) and C-reactive protein (CRP; 300 mg/L). Urgent right hemiscrotal exploration revealed about 5 ml of pus in the tunica vaginalis and a normal testicle. A right iliac fossa incision identified the cause: a perforated retrocecal appendix. Appendectomy was performed, and both the abdomen and scrotum washed copiously with saline before closure. The patient made an uneventful recovery. Acute appendicitis presenting with scrotal signs due to a patent processus vaginalis is an extremely rare clinical entity. To date, fewer than five such cases have been reported in the medical literature. It is, therefore, extremely important to be aware of this unusual clinical scenario, as only a high index of suspicion will enable prompt, successful management of both the appendicitis and the scrotal abscess."

    "abstract": "Suspected testicular torsion (TT) is a surgical emergency, usually requiring urgent scrotal exploration. Provision of urology on-call cover varies widely between hospitals and often falls under the remit of the general surgical team. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the management of suspected TT differed between urology (UT) and surgical (ST) trainees in the Severn and South West Peninsula Deaneries. An on-line questionnaire (SurveyMonkey. com) was sent to all UT and ST within the Deaneries. Questions covered training, on-call cover, intra-operative management and knowledge of complications following testicular fixation. Responses were analysed using an Excel spreadsheet and GraphPad statistical package. Responses were received from 26/31 UT and 43/52 ST throughout 17 hospitals. Only three hospitals had separate middle-grade specialist urology cover. Scrotal exploration was taught by urologists to 72% of UT compared with 40% of ST (P = 0.012, Fisher's exact test). Variability in the number of operations performed, supervision and management of true TT was insignificant. However, ST were more likely to fix a normal testicle either in the absence of other pathology (53% vs 28%) or with a twisted appendix testis (42% vs 15%) than UT (P = 0.045 and P = 0.032, respectively). UT were more aware of evidence regarding chronic pain (47% vs 14%) and infertility (53% vs 18%) following testicular fixation than ST (P = 0.005 and P = 0.003, respectively). Medicolegally, 76% of UT would inform the on-call consultant prior to operation compared with 45% of ST (P = 0.012). ST are significantly more likely to fix a normal testicle than UT (and then usually only on the affected side), contrary to best-practice. This variation may be due to the different sources of training received by the two groups. Knowledge of possible chronic pain and infertility following testicular fixation may also affect management. Due to the variation, we suggest urology departments should draw up guidelines for management; trainees should be encouraged to discuss the case pre-operatively with the consultant; core surgical training should include a urology placement."

Symptom duration was greater in the orchiectomy group with a mean difference of 47.9 hours (p <0.01). The mean transfer delay was 1 hour 15 minutes longer in the orchiectomy group (p = 0.01). Boys who underwent orchiectomy were 2.2 years younger than those who avoided orchiectomy (p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that symptom duration and distance from the hospital were the strongest predictors of orchiectomy. Data suggest that torsion is a time dependent event and factors that delay time to treatment lead to poorer outcomes. These factors include distance from the hospital and the time delay associated with hospital transfer."

Recently, we experienced rare cases of acute scrotum caused by vasitis.

Thirty-two pediatric patients were admitted to our institutions with a diagnosis of acute scrotum between 1997 and 2008. The average age of the patients was 7.1 years. We summarize and review the clinical and pathologic features of 2 patients with vasitis with abscess formation. The causes of acute scrotum included epididymitis, testicular torsion, and vasitis, among others. Testicular torsion was initially suspected in 23 of the patients. Twenty-three patients underwent emergency surgery, among whom 9 received orchidectomies. The initial diagnosis differed from the final diagnosis in 20 patients (62.5%). Two patients were diagnosed with vasitis. Both underwent emergency operations under a putative diagnosis of testicular torsion, and both were found to have hard tumorlike lesions in the scrotal portion during the surgery. These same 2 cases also suffered from lower urological anomalies, namely, hypospadias, posterior urethral valve, and Müllerian duct remnant. Based on our experience, we propose that lower urological anomalies predispose children to vasitis and subsequent abscess formation. Pathologic conditions of this type have to be considered as potential causes of acute scrotum."

Two hours after induced torsion, drugs were injected intraperitoneally. Rats in group 2 received no drug, whereas those in groups 3, 4 and 5 were administered a single dose of papaverine (35 mg/kg), lidocaine (4 mg/kg) and verapamil (0.1 mg/kg), respectively. Thirty minutes after drug injection (2.5 h after torsion), testis detorsion was performed in all groups. The drug injections continued for 1 week. After 20 days, bilateral orchiectomy was carried out and semen from both testes was evaluated. In animals treated with verapamil, left testis sperm count and the percentage of motile sperm were increased significantly in comparison with the sham-operated animals. Sperm morphology in all groups was in the normal range. Mean sperm count and motility in the right testes were not significantly different in different groups. Verapamil can induce beneficial effects on semen analysis parameters after testicular torsion in rats."

    "abstract": "Although true urologic emergencies are extremely rare, they are a vital part of any emergency physician's (EP) knowledge base, as delays in treatment lead to permanent damage. The four urologic emergencies discussed are priapism, paraphimosis, testicular torsion, and Fournier's gangrene. An overview is given for each, including causes, pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and new developments. The focus for priapism is on diagnosis and distinguishing high-flow from low-flow forms, as the latter requires emergent treatment. For paraphimosis, we describe various methods of relieving the stricture, from manual reduction to surgery in extreme cases. For testicular torsion, the most important factor in salvaging the testicle is decreasing time to treatment. This is accomplished through experience and understanding which signs and symptoms strongly suggest it, so that time-consuming tests are avoided. Lastly, Fournier's gangrene is potentially fatal. While aggressive medical and surgical therapy will improve chances of survival and outcome, it is vital for the emergency department (ED) physician to diagnose Fournier's. It often presents in the elderly, immunocompromised, or those with depressed mental status. The goal of this paper is to arm EPs with information to recognize urological emergencies and intervene quickly to preserve tissue, fertility, and life."

Prediction of testicular viability is essential for deciding whether to perform emergency exploration surgery. The aim of the present study, therefore, was to investigate the sonomorphological parameters as predictors for testicular viability. All our cases of sonographically diagnosed and surgically confirmed testicular torsion (n = 25) in a 7.5-year period were reviewed. We evaluated the overall group and two subgroups, PTT (n = 9) and TT (n = 16), and assessed the following sonomorphological parameters: normal echogenicity (homogeneous), diffuse hyper-/hypoechogenicity (homogeneous) and focal hyper-/hypoechogenicity (heterogeneous). These findings were correlated with the testicular recovery rate. In both groups, we found the highest recovery rates in testes with normal, homogeneous echogenicity and a zero recovery rate in testes with heterogeneous echogenicity (p = 0.0117). By using the sonomorpohological criteria presented here, testicular viability can be appraised in all age groups to help determine the prognosis for testicular outcome. In PTT, a nonperfused, homogeneously appearing testis represents the initial phase of torsion. Only for this type is there hope for salvage. In addition to the intraoperative appearance, a testis that is preoperatively heterogeneous in appearance can support the decision for orchiectomy."

Overall CDS sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for TT diagnosis was 96.8%, 97.9%, 92.1%, and 99.1%, respectively. The mean age for the occurrence of TA and TT was 11.2 and 13.4 years, respectively (P <.0001). The peak incidence of TT was between age 14 and 16. Boys with TT sought medical attention statistically significantly earlier than those with TA or epididymitis obviously because of more severe pain (P <.0001). At the time of exploration for TT the affected testicle could be preserved in 32 boys (85.5%). In the remaining 9 boys the testis was considered nonviable and removed.

The most common finding was torted cyst of Morgagni (63/119, 52.9%), followed by testicular torsion (41/119, 34.4%). The majority of testicular torsions occurred in the pubertal group (22/41, 53.6%). Only one patient in this group had an unsalvageable testis necessitating orchidectomy, a testicular loss rate in torsion of 2.4%. There were no postoperative wound infections or scrotal haematomas. Testicular salvage depends critically on early surgical intervention, so the delay incurred in diagnostic imaging may extend the period of ischaemia. Furthermore, all radiological investigations have a certain false-negative rate. We advocate immediate surgical exploration of the acute scrotum.

PPARs are a family of nuclear hormone receptors belonging to the steroid receptor superfamily. Three PPAR isotypes (alpha, beta/delta and gamma) encoded by separate genes and showing different tissue distribution patterns have been identified. PPARbeta/delta is expressed in testis and its role is largely unknown. We tested whether pharmacological activation of PPARbeta/delta might protect the testis from ischemia and reperfusion injury. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 1-hour testicular ischemia, followed by 24 hours of reperfusion. Sham testicular ischemia-reperfusion rats served as controls. The animals were randomized to receive immediately after detorsion 1) L-165,041 (4 mg/kg intraperitoneally), a potent agonist of PPARbeta/delta, 2) GW9662 (Calbiochem(R)) (4 mg/kg intraperitoneally), an antagonist of PPAR, 3) L-165,041 (4 mg/kg intraperitoneally) plus GW9662 (4 mg/kg intraperitoneally) concomitantly or 4) vehicle (1 ml/kg 10% dimethyl sulfoxide/NaCl solution). We evaluated testicular extracellular signal regulated kinase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 by Western blot. We also investigated PPARbeta/delta activation by Western blot, mRNA expression and organ damage. Testicular ischemia-reperfusion injury caused a significant increase in extracellular signal regulated kinase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 expression in each testis. Furthermore, histological examination revealed marked damage. L-165,041 administration increased the PPARbeta/delta message and protein, inhibited extracellular signal regulated kinase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 expression, and decreased histological damage. Concomitant administration of GW9662 reversed the protection exerted by PPARbeta/delta agonist. These findings indicate that PPARbeta/delta agonists might be an attractive therapeutic candidate for managing testicular torsion."

Since contralateral scrotum showed swelling, we performed emergency surgery on that day. The right spermatic cord was constricted due to extravaginal torsion, and degree and direction of torsion was unclear since the spermatic cord was already organized. Right testis showed irreversible necrotic change, requiring orchiectomy. We confirmed that left testis was intact and performed orchidopexy. Since high incidence of contralateral asymptomatic torsion has been reported in patients with prenatal testicular torsion, emergency surgery should be considered when contralateral scrotum shows abnormal findings."

We retrospectively analyzed the group of 354 patients in 10 years (1997-2006) to compare the preoperative findings with the diagnosis of surgical exploration. The aim was to actualize diagnostics and therapeutic management. We focused on the age of patients, incidence of nosological units of AS and preoperative and surgical diagnosis. 334 boys were operated on from the whole group - 354 patients. Most frequent incidence of AS was in the age group 8-12 (55%). Torsion of testicular appendix or epididymis is the most frequent cause of AS in our group - 204, 59%. In this group of patients ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis only in 120 patients, 65%. Testicular torsion was managed in 74 boys (30 neonates), in 40 of them we decided, mostly at the second look operation after 48-72 hours, for testicle ablation caused by the organ avitality. In all patients with testicular torsion ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis, 100%. In 10 boys we found testicular tumor. In the group of 334 patients operated on, there were no serious complications. Testicular torsion and tumor are the units in which the surgical exploration is performed without discussion. Beside that, torsion of the testicular or epididymic appendix is the most frequent occurring diagnosis. There is a group of surgeons, who performed in this unit conservative management. after the analysis of the group of our patients we actualized the guidelines used in the management of AS in children. Urgent surgical exploration in boys with AS still seems to be the method of choice."

    "abstract": "Scrotal masses can represent a wide range of medical issues, from benign congenital conditions to life-threatening malignancies and acute surgical emergencies. Having a clear understanding of scrotal anatomy allows the examiner to accurately identify most lesions. Benign lesions such as hydroceles and varicoceles are often found incidentally by the patient or physician on routine examination. Epididymitis is bacterial in origin, readily diagnosed on physical examination, and treated with antibiotics. Indirect inguinal hernias usually are palpable separate from the normal scrotal contents and are a surgical emergency if strangulation is suspected based on symptoms of abdominal pain, tenderness, and nonreducibility. Testicular swelling may be caused by orchitis, cancer, or testicular torsion. Orchitis is usually viral in origin, subacute in onset, and may be accompanied by systemic illness. Testicular carcinomas are more gradual in onset; the testis will be nontender on examination. Testicular torsion has an acute onset, often with no antecedent trauma; the involved testis may be retracted and palpably rotated, and will be tender on examination. The swollen testis is always a true emergency. Although history and examination may suggest the diagnosis, testicular torsion can be reliably confirmed only with color Doppler ultrasonography, which must be obtained immediately. If torsion is suspected, surgical consultation should be obtained concurrently with ultrasonography, because the ability to successfully salvage the affected testis declines dramatically after six hours of torsion."

To report a case that describes the presentation, diagnosis, and management of testicular infarction in the setting of an incarcerated inguinal hernia. A 2-month old boy was brought to the Emergency Department (ED) by his parents for vomiting, crying, and a left-sided scrotal swelling. An inguinal hernia was manually reduced successfully in the ED. Subsequently, scrotal ultrasound with color Doppler was obtained, demonstrating no blood flow to the left testis. The patient underwent a left orchiectomy and right orchiopexy with hernia repair. Testicular injury can occur from torsion due to the effect of an incarcerated hernia or due to ischemia from cord compression. Delay in diagnosis and surgery risks testicular viability, therefore, surgery should not be delayed for imaging in the presence of strong suspicion of torsion. The diagnosis of testicular torsion is not always straightforward because many conditions may have a similar clinical presentation or may compromise testicular blood supply. This case is an unusual presentation of testicular infarction in the setting of an incarcerated inguinal hernia."

    "abstract": "Perinatal testicular torsion (PTT) is a rare event with controversies surrounding its etiology, prebsentation, surgical management and sequelae. Our survey assessed the preferences of pediatric urologists with regard to its management. Four cases of unilateral PTT and a questionnaire containing 11 questions about management of common clinical scenarios were mailed to 26 pediatric urologists. The answers were received anonymously and they were analyzed blindly. The response rate was 80% (21/26), with 90% (19/21) of respondents holding academic appointments. In the 2 first cases of PTT with a typical unilateral nonviable testis, 76% (16/21) and 67% (14/21), respectively, opted for surgery. A case of acute postnatal torsion resulted in 100% agreement to urgent scrotal exploration. In the case of an atrophic testis, none of the respondents opted for immediate surgery; yet, 38% (8/21) said they would proceed with a delayed orchiopexy of the contralateral testicle. In the question section, 10% (2/21) responded that they preferred to explore PTT immediately; whereas, 57% (12/21) would delay surgical exploration for a few days until the neonate was better stabilized. One-third of participants (7/21) would not perform a surgical exploration but would just follow the child clinically. A scrotal incision for contralateral orchiopexy was preferred by 52% (11/21), while 48% (10/21) prefer a scrotal approach but would switch to an inguinal incision if a hydrocele were present. Operative intervention was favoured by 80% (8/10) and 46% (5/11) of those with less than and greater than 10 years of practice, respectively. This survey revealed that 67% (14/21) of respondents preferred immediate exploration of a torted testis and contralateral orchiopexy, compared with the nonoperative approach. Scrotal incision for the exploration was preferred by most respondents. There was a trend to choose less aggressive treatment as the years of practice increase. Studies of more robust design, such as randomized controlled trials, are necessary to determine the natural history and outcomes of this uncommon type of testicular torsion."

    "abstract": "In the setting of signs and symptoms of testicular torsion the absence of diastolic flow and/or color flow on Doppler ultrasound has traditionally prompted emergent scrotal exploration. This practice emanates largely from the difficulty on ultrasound of distinguishing salvageable torsed testes from those that are not salvageable. We identified ultrasound findings predictive of testicular viability or the lack thereof. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of all boys who underwent scrotal exploration for signs and symptoms of torsion during a 4-year period. In those who underwent preoperative Doppler ultrasound of the scrotum ultrasound findings were reviewed, as were the operative dictations. In patients who underwent orchiectomy the pathology reports were also reviewed. In patients in whom the torsed testis appeared viable and who underwent orchiopexy followup data were reviewed when available. Emergency room charts were also reviewed to ascertain, when documented, the duration of pain before presentation to the emergency room and the interval between ultrasound and operating room. During this period 55 boys underwent exploration after preoperative scrotal Doppler ultrasound revealed absent diastolic flow and/or color flow Doppler in the symptomatic testis. Assessment of parenchymal echogenicity revealed heterogeneity in 37 testes (67%), of which none were deemed viable at exploration. Orchiectomy was performed in 34 of 37 cases. Pathological examination revealed necrosis in all 34 cases, a finding consistent with late torsion. The remaining 3 testes underwent orchiopexy by parental directive despite nonviability, as confirmed by biopsy and subsequent atrophy. Thus, heterogeneity on preoperative ultrasound was universally predictive of organ loss (chi-square p <0.001). Of the 18 symptomatic testes (33%) demonstrating homogeneity and isoechogenicity on ultrasound 16 (89%) were deemed viable at exploration. Boys in whom the torsed testicle was nonviable on exploration experienced an average of 27.5 hours of pain preoperatively (range 5 to 72), whereas boys in whom the torsed testis was salvaged experienced an average of 20.5 hours of pain (range 2 to 96) (p = 0.073). The nonviable group underwent surgery an average of 49 minutes after ultrasound, whereas the viable group underwent surgery 52 minutes after ultrasound (p = 0.92). None of the 55 patients experienced any surgical or anesthetic complications and no pathological condition was noted intraoperatively in the contralateral asymptomatic testis. In the setting of Doppler proven testicular torsion heterogeneous parenchymal echo texture indicates late torsion and testicular nonviability. Therefore, the case may not require emergent scrotal exploration. On the other hand, homogeneous echo texture portends extremely well for testicular viability. Thus, such testes should be explored emergently."

    "abstract": "Caudal anesthesia is the most common type of regional anesthetic technique performed in children. The incidence of neurologic adverse events is extremely rare. A postoperative complication of a mild but permanent neurologic deficit after administration of a caudal anesthetic in a previously well 9-year-old boy who required emergency scrotal exploration for a testicular torsion is reported. The caudal injection provided good postoperative analgesia, which probably resulted in the patient remaining in the same position overnight. This may have contributed to the development of the neurologic deficit, probably owing to a compressive neuropathy. We suggest that, as anesthesiologists obtaining informed consent for anesthetic interventions, we now need to inform guardians/carers of pediatric patients who are to receive caudal analgesia of the extremely small material risk of neurologic damage after caudal anesthesia. Additionally, the anesthetic community may need to consider revising postoperative care instructions to prevent the future occurrence of this rare outcome, particularly if using additives that prolong analgesic block duration."

We reviewed a large series of such cases and stratified neonatal torsion based on time of presentation to determine the potential for testicular salvage. To our knowledge this is the largest series of its kind in the literature. All cases of neonatal torsion were classified as either prenatal (noted at the time of delivery) or postnatal (noted after birth and before age 1 month). The charts of all patients were reviewed and data were collected on demographic information, pregnancy and birth history, laterality, physical examination findings, radiological imaging, intraoperative findings, anesthetic morbidities, perioperative complications and pathological diagnoses. Followup data were also collected for patients who underwent detorsion and orchiopexy. A total of 16 neonatal torsions (right side 8, left side 6, bilateral 1) were diagnosed in 15 patients at our institution between 1993 and 2007. A total of 13 torsions (81%) were prenatal and 3 (19%) were postnatal. All 13 prenatal torsions (100%) resulted in infarction (right 7, left 4, bilateral 2) confirmed by pathological examination. All patients underwent testicular exploration via an inguinal approach. A total of 11 cases were managed by orchiectomy at an average of 7.6 days (range 0 to 37) following birth. One of the bilaterally torsed testes showed infarction and necrosis on biopsy, and was detorsed and fixed in place. A second prenatally torsed testis was detorsed and pexed but atrophied on followup. Among the 3 postnatal torsions 1 (33%) was deemed viable on exploration and, therefore, salvaged. Of the 10 prenatal torsions with known prenatal history 5 (50%) were associated with at least 1 significant prenatal complication. Nine of the 10 patients with prenatal torsion (90%) were delivered vaginally, and 1 by cesarean section after prolonged failure of descent. Complicated pregnancies and vaginal deliveries seem to predispose patients to testicular torsion. Contrary to previous series, neonatal torsions do not appear to favor one side or the other. Prenatal torsions are never salvageable, and, therefore, do not warrant emergent intervention. Postnatal torsions are sometimes salvaged, and a judicious approach to surgical exploration should be taken."

Due to the clinical suspicion of re-torsion an immediate surgical exposure of the testis was performed. Intraoperatively a torsion of the left spermatic cord was found. After detorquation, there was no significant sign of recovery observed. In order to preserve the endocrine function, the single testis was maintained. During follow-up, necrosis of the left testis was noticed, and a secondary left orchiectomy was necessary three weeks after first operation. After loss of both testes the patient was referred to a paediatric endocrinological consultant and testosterone substitution was started. Even though very rare, orchidopexy does not exclude re-torsion of a fixed testis, regardless of the employed operative technique and sutures used.

The exact cause of IUTT is not known, and controversies still continue regarding the need for urgent exploration as well as the necessity of contralateral orchidopexy. This is a review of our experience with 11 cases of IUTT, highlighting aspects of diagnosis and management. From 1990 to 2005, we treated 11 newborns with IUTT. Their mean birth weight was 3.50 kg (range, 2.6-4.12 kg). Their age at presentation ranged from 2 hours to 10 days (mean, 45 hours). All underwent emergency exploration. There were 6 left-sided, 4 right-sided, and 1 bilateral torsion. In all, the affected testis was enlarged, tender, firm in consistency, and higher in position, and the overlying skin was dark red in color. Exploration revealed extravaginal torsion in all. In 1, there was partial torsion and the testis was enlarged, congested, but not gangrenous. Another child had complete torsion, but the testis was found enlarged, congested with hemorrhage, but not gangrenous. Both were treated with detorsion and preservation of testes and bilateral orchidopexy. On follow-up, both testes were viable, of good size, and in normal position. The patient with bilateral torsion had frankly necrotic left testis that was removed, but the right testis was smaller in size and ischemic but not frankly necrotic, so it was preserved, but on follow-up, it was found atrophic. One of our patients was evaluated few hours after delivery and found to have normal testes. On the second day, he was found to have enlarged, tender left testis. Emergency exploration revealed extravaginal torsion with slightly enlarged left testis that was ischemic but not frankly necrotic. This was preserved and bilateral orchidopexy was done. On follow-up, both testes were viable, of good size, and normal position. In the remaining 7 patients, the testes were frankly necrotic. They were treated with orchidectomy and contralateral orchidopexy. Histology of the removed testes was variable. In 6, the testes were totally necrotic without any viable testicular tissue, whereas in the remaining 2, there was preservation of some semineferous tubules and hemorrhage with ischemic infarction. Intrauterine torsion of testes should be treated as an emergency.

It clearly depicts simple versus complex hydroceles and determines the presence of underlying testicular or epididymal disease.

Prevention of testicular damage caused by torsion is still a clinical and experimental problem. So far many chemicals and drugs have been investigated for decreasing ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in experimental animals. The possible protective effect of darbepoetin alfa, a novel erythropoietic protein, on testicular tissue after I/R injury was examined in this study. Thirty rats were divided into three groups: sham operation, torsion/detorsion, and torsion/detorsion plus darbepoetin alfa groups. After torsion (2 hours) and detorsion (4 hours), bilateral orchiectomy was performed. Malondialdehyde, nitric oxide and glutathione levels were determined in testicular tissue. Administration of darbepoetin alfa caused a decrease of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide levels and an increase in glutathione levels compared with the torsion/detorsion group. In addition, histological injury scores were significantly decreased in the treatment group more than the torsion/detorsion group. The results suggest that darbepoetin alfa may be a potential protective agent for preventing testicular injury caused by testis torsion."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a urological syndrome caused mainly by a twist in the spermatic cord. It constitutes a surgical emergency and affects newborns, children and adolescent boys. The torsion must be treated promptly to avoid loss of function of ipsilateral and contralateral testis. This syndrome often leads to infertility of the ipsilateral (torted) and contralateral (not torted) testis,but the mechanisms of cellular injury remain still incompletely understood. The primary pathophysiologic event in testicular torsion is ischemia followed by reperfusion; thus, testicular torsion/detorsion is an ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury to the testis. Testicular torsion and detorsion causes morphological and biochemical changes by both ischemia and reperfusion of the tissues. These I/R injury is associated with overgeneration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and also with a common mechanism to other organs such as brain, heart and kidneys. Although the results are not conclusive and the molecular mechanism by which antioxidants control male fertility have not yet been clearly identified, several antioxidant enzymes and antioxidant drugs have been studied to prevent such I/R injury in testis. As a result, antioxidant therapy may represent a new non-hormonal option within a broader therapeutic strategy in men with ROS-mediated infertility such as testicular torsion."

Therefore, the clinical and surgical aspects of bilateral torsion in a neonate have not been subjected to detailed analysis. We performed a retrospective analysis of our experience in the management of bilateral perinatal torsion as well as a collective review of the medical literature. All cases of neonatal testicular torsion managed at our neonatal surgical center during the last 2 decades (1986 to 2005) were reviewed, and 3 cases of bilateral torsion were identified. In addition, 45 neonatal cases of bilateral torsion were found through the literature search. In all cases data regarding clinical presentation, imaging studies, surgical management, intraoperative and pathological findings, and final outcome were analyzed. Synchronous torsion occurred in 32 of 48 newborns (67%), while asynchronous pathology was reported in 16 (33%), including the 3 presented in this report. All except 1 patient were full-term newborns with normal or above average birth weight. Difficult delivery was noted in 33% of the cases. Despite prompt surgical intervention in 46 infants, the salvage rate was low, with arterial flow confirmed postoperatively in only 3 gonads (3.1%). Four gonads in 3 additional patients were reported to be of normal size on followup. Asynchronous torsion is not as rare an event as previously reported, and it may pose a diagnostic challenge. In the majority of these cases torsion of the left testis seems to occur later than torsion of the right testis. The role of imaging studies in newborns with bilateral torsion seems to be limited, especially in cases of asynchronous pathology. Urgent bilateral exploration is strongly advised in all newborns presenting with either unilateral or bilateral torsion. Such policy carries diagnostic, potential therapeutic and prognostic implications."

    "abstract": "Pediatric surgeons and urologists are often asked to evaluate boys with acute scrotal pain and inflammation. Although there are myriad etiologies for this syndrome, testicular torsion should be at the top of the list. It is the one diagnosis that must be made accurately and rapidly if there is any hope for testicular salvage. The purpose of this article is to update/review the appropriate evaluation and management of the acute scrotum and to guide the clinician in distinguishing testicular torsion from the other conditions that commonly mimic this surgical emergency."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a urological emergency that requires immediate surgical intervention to prevent testicular damage. The aim of the study was to investigate the preventive effects of thiopental and propofol as anesthetics on testicular ischemia-reperfusion injury. Forty male Wistar Albino rats were randomly assigned to four groups of 10 rats each. During 5 h, anesthesia was induced and maintained with thiopental in groups 1 and 2 and with propofol in groups 3 and 4. Groups 2 and 4 received left testicular ischemia (torsion) during 1 h and reperfusion (detorsion) during 4 h. Groups 1 and 3 (control groups) had no testicular torsion and detorsion. At the end of 5 h, animals were killed and both ipsilateral and contralateral testes were removed for histopathologic examination and measurement of tissue MDA (malondialdehyde) and NO (nitric oxide) levels. In the contralateral testes of all the groups, MDA and NO measurements were not different from ipsilateral testes of the control groups. Between the groups 1 and 3, there were no differences in MDA and NO levels. Although torsion/detorsion of testes in group 4 caused significantly increased levels of tissue MDA and NO values compared with group 3, ischemia-reperfusion in group 2 caused a further increase in these levels compared with group 4. The ipsilateral testes in the control groups did not show any morphological changes. Testicular torsion/detorsion in rats with thiopental anesthesia (group 2) caused significantly greater histopathologic injury levels than rats with propofol anesthesia (group 4). Our results suggest that propofol as an anesthetic agent may prevent testicular damage by scavenging reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and inhibiting lipid peroxidation in an animal model of testicular torsion and detorsion."

    "abstract": "Torsion of the testis, also referred to as torsion of the spermatic cord, is a subject of debate among physicians and surgeons. Testicular torsion is an acute vascular event causing the rotation of the vascular pedicle of the testis, thereby impeding the blood flow to the testis and the scrotal contents. It could be either within or outside the tunica vaginalis. Testicular torsion causes immediate circulatory changes and long-term sequelae such as testicular function and fertility. It is considered a surgical emergency, as a delay causes irreversible testicular damage. The diagnosis and treatment of testicular torsion are discussed in this review, which also illustrates an algorithm and a scoring system for the diagnosis and management of this condition based on current literature."

    "title": "Protective effect of L-carnitine on testicular ischaemia-reperfusion injury in rats.",
    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a urological emergency referred to as 'acute scrotum', because inappropriate treatment can lead to male subfertility and infertility. A possible cause of testicular damage is the ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury attributed to oxygen free radicals. L-carnitine, a vitamin-like antioxidant, plays a pivotal role in the maturation of spermatozoa within the reproductive tract. The aim of the present paper was to determine the protective effect of L-carnitine on testicular I/R-induced injury. Thirty-two male rats were divided into 4 groups (n = 8). Testicular torsion was created by rotating the right testis 720 degrees in a clockwise direction. Group 1: sham-operated control; group 2: ischaemia; group 3: I/R; group 4: ischaemia-L-carnitine treatment-reperfusion group. L-carnitine (500 mg kg(-1), intraperitoneally) was administered before 30 min of detorsion in Group 4. After torsion (5 h) and detorsion (5 h), bilateral orchidectomy was performed. The malondialdehyde (MDA) level was evaluated in testes. Histopathologically, Johnsen's spermatogenesis criteria and mean seminiferous tubule diameter (MSTD) measurements were used. Testicular MDA levels were higher in the torsion group compared to the sham-control group (p < 0.05). Detorsion (reperfusion) caused a further increase in MDA levels (p < 0.05). Pretreatment with L-carnitine prevented a further increase in MDA levels (p < 0.05). Histologically, torsion caused some separation among germinal cells in the seminiferous tubules, which became much more prominent in the I/R group but was attenuated with L-carnitine pretreatment. In conclusion, L-carnitine pretreatment may have a protective effect in experimental testicular torsion-detorsion model in rats by its well-known antioxidant potential."

    "abstract": "Acute testicular torsion in children is an emergency and has to be diagnosed urgently. Doppler sonography is increasingly used in imaging the acute scrotum. Nevertheless, in uncertain cases, surgical exploration is required. In this study, we attempted to define the role of Doppler sonography in the diagnostic workup of the acutely painful scrotum. All patients admitted between 1999 and 2005 with acute scrotal pain were included. After clinical assessment, patients were imaged by Doppler sonography with a ''high-end'' instrument. In cases of absent arterial perfusion of the testis in Doppler sonography, surgical exploration was carried out. Patients with unaffected perfusion were followed clinically by ultrasound for up to 2 years. Sixty-one infants and children aged 1 day to 17 years (median: 7.9 years) were included. In 14 cases, sonography demonstrated absent central perfusion, with abnormal parenchymal echogenicity in six. Absence of venous blood flow together with reduction of central arterial perfusion was found in one infant. In these 15 patients, surgical exploration confirmed testicular torsion. Among the other 46 patients, we found four cases with increased testicular perfusion and 27 with increased perfusion of the epididymis. In one infant, a testicular tumour was found sonographically, and orchiectomy confirmed diagnosis of a teratoma. Follow-up examinations of the conservatively treated patients showed good clinical outcome with physiologic central perfusion as well as normal echogenic pattern of both testes. No case of testicular torsion was missed. By means of Doppler sonography, an unequivocal statement regarding testicular perfusion was possible in all cases. The initial Doppler diagnosis was confirmed by operative evaluation and follow-up ultrasound. Testicular torsion can therefore be excluded by correctly performed ultrasound with modern equipment."

    "abstract": "The literature concerning undescended testis mainly concentrates on the increased risks of infertility and development of germ cell tumors. Yet the UDT also appears to be at higher risk for torsion compared to the normally descended testis, and this issue is relatively poorly addressed. We reviewed all cases of torsion of UDTs operated on at our hospital during the last 20 years in an attempt to characterize better this condition and its salvageability. In this retrospective clinical study we reviewed and analyzed all cases of testicular torsion involving UDT operated on at our hospital between 1984 and 2004. A total of 11 children were operated on at our hospital for torsion of undescended testis between 1984 and 2004. Patient age ranged from 1 month to 18 years (median 7.5 months). In all cases unilateral torsion of undescended testis was diagnosed, with 73% of cases involving the left side. Clinical symptoms included inguinal swelling and erythema associated with a tender, firm mass palpated in the groin area and an empty ipsilateral hemiscrotum. Doppler ultrasound examination was routinely performed in the last 7 patients to confirm the diagnosis. During inguinoscrotal exploration severe ischemia or overt necrosis of the testis was found in 5 of 11 cases. Three of these 5 cases were managed by orchiectomy, while in the other 2 cases the testis subsequently vanished. In the 6 patients who exhibited some improvement following detorsion and warming of the tissue the testes were preserved and orchiopexy was performed. Followup was available in only 5 patients, with vanishing of the torsed testis observed in 4 and a normal testicle detected 21 years postoperatively in 1 patient who was diagnosed early. This series clearly demonstrates poor rates of surgical salvage, which we mainly attribute to delays in parental response and in primary physician referral to the hospital. Parents, who have a pivotal role in early diagnosis, were usually unaware of this urological emergency, and some were surprisingly unaware of the presence of cryptorchidism. By increasing the awareness regarding this entity among members of the medical community and parents, we hope that torsion of the cryptorchid testis (literally, \"hidden testis\") will no longer necessarily be synonymous with \"crypt-torsion\" (\"hidden torsion\")."

    "abstract": "To highlight the ultrasonographic features of prenatal torsion of the testis in utero (IUTT) at presentation, the neonatal management and the histological findings postorchiectomy or biopsy. Seven newborns underwent emergency exploration for IUTT. All patients underwent a sonography and real-time color Doppler ultrasound study of the scrotum before any surgical procedure. A histological examination was performed in the removed specimens. Sonography of the scrotum revealed enlarged, heterogeneous testes. In all cases the color and power Doppler did not reveal any flow signal on the affected side. Four newborn with unilateral testicular torsion underwent orchiectomy and contralateral orchidopexy. In one neonate after detorsion and with the absence of gangrenous changes and a reassuring biopsy, a twisted testis could be treated conservatively with orchidopexy. In another case, the parents, acknowledging the inviability of the affected testis, gave consent only for a biopsy of the testis. In the neonate with bilateral IUTT, bilateral testicular biopsies were performed. Histology of the removed testes variably showed interstitial red cell extravasion and coagulation or hemorrhagic necrosis. Light microscopy of the preserved testis highlighted surviving seminiferous tubules, with gonocytes, spermatogonia and fetal Sertoli cells. An early diagnosis and treatment in IUTT is essential. Surgical exploration should be always performed through the inguinal route. In bilateral IUTT testes should be left to try to assure, as long as possible, a residual Leydig cell function."

Nausea and vomiting are positive predictive value for testicular torsion. Main findings predicting testicular torsion are absence of cremasteric reflex and diffuse tenderness.

    "abstract": "Patients with history of testicular torsion who have undergone orchiopexy may rarely present with acute scrotum due to recurrent episodes of torsion. Most of the reports in the literature regarding this scenario refer to the era when absorbable sutures were used for testicular fixation. Herein, we review our experience in recent years, focusing upon the surgical technique and sutures' material. Between 1991 and 2003, 179 patients were operated on at our institute with the clinical diagnosis of unilateral testicular torsion. They ranged in age between neonates to 45 years old (average age 18). In a comprehensive retrospective study we managed to locate 8 patients who experienced recurrent intravaginal testicular torsion following previous fixation performed in our institute. The patients who experienced repeat torsion have initially presented at the mean age of 18.5 years old (range 12 to 30) with unilateral twisted testicle (left 3, right 5). Urgent explorations were generally performed, apart from in 2 cases that underwent spontaneous detorsion which was followed by an elective surgery. Testicular fixation was conducted by suturing of the tunica albuginea to the dartos layer by 2 sutures at each side, using chromic 3-zero in the 3 more early cases, followed by the usage of polyglactin 3-zero stitches in 4 subsequent cases and 3 sutures of polypropylene 4-zero for each testicle, thereafter, in the most recent case. The patients presented with repeat torsion, 0.5 to 23 years subsequently (average 7 years), involving either the ipsilateral testicle in 4 cases or the contralateral gonad in 4. Recurrent torsion following previous testicular fixation may appear many years following the primary procedure, even in cases in which either polyglactin or, notwithstanding, polypropylene sutures have been applied, in accordance with the common practice used in the last 2 decades. Increased awareness regarding this possibility is imperative for early diagnosis and prevention of testicular loss."

This was a prospective study of consecutive patients presenting with the acute scrotum at Jos University Teaching Hospital, Nigeria from January 2001 to December 2002. Twenty-nine patients were studied with a mean age of 29.4 years (range 12 days to 80 years). Seventeen (58.6%) were 11 to 30 years old. The clinical diagnostic accuracy for testicular torsion was 75% because out of the 24 patients initially thought to have testicular torsion, 18 (62.1%), four (14.8%) and two (6.9%) had testicular torsion, epididymoorchitis and torsion of appendix testis respectively at exploration. The diagnosis in other patients was intrascrotral abscess in two (6.9%), Fournier's gangrene in one (3.4%) and haematocoele in one (3.4%). Only four (13.9%) patients presented within the first 24 hours of illness (all explored within 6 hours) and 14 (48.3%) in one to five days. Thirteen (44.6%) patients had orchidopexy while seven (24.2%) had orchidectomy as a result of testicular torsion (five) and intrascrotal abscesses (two). Testicular exploration only, with antibiotics was the treatment for patients eventually found to have epididymoorchitis, with good response. Testicular salvage rate was 72% in patients with testicular torsion. Postoperative complications observed in three patients were wound infection (two) and wound dehiscence (two). We conclude that testicular torsion is the most common cause of acute scrotum in our environment. Majority of our patients with acute scrotum present to hospital late. Health education of the public and attending physicians is required in order to reduce delay in presentation, improve diagnostic skills, testicular salvage rate and prognosis."

    "abstract": "Acute scrotum represents an emergency situation although testicular torsion is present in less than 20% of the cases. Sonography has meanwhile become the definitive modality for diagnosis. Its increasing use before surgical intervention has led to technical improvements in ultrasound diagnostics and critical assessment of ultrasound criteria to exclude testicular torsion as well as standardization of examination procedures. Central arterial and venous perfusion shown to be bilaterally equal on Doppler sonography is the most important criterion for excluding torsion. This article discusses other criteria such as the \"resistance index,\" comparison of parenchymal structure of both testes, evidence for spermatic cord torsion, or differences between the sides in perfusion of the testicular parenchyma and highlights the difficulties involved in partial and intermittent testicular torsion. Alternative investigative methods and the significance of sonography in the differential diagnosis of other underlying causes are addressed. In summary, the combination of interpreting B-mode imaging, color Doppler, and power Doppler sonography and analyzing Doppler flow curves after clinical examination results in successful and conclusive evaluation of the testes in cases of acute scrotum in boys."

This has a tendency to occur more frequently during adolescence and its cause is unknown. The most common signs and symptoms include red, swollen scrotum and acutely painful testicle, often in the absence of trauma. Nausea and vomiting are common. The most common conditions in the differential diagnosis include epididymitis, strangulated inguinal hernia, traumatic hematoma, testicular tumor, or testicular fracture. Physical examination techniques such as scrotal elevation can be helpful in differentiating between epididymitis and testicular torsion, but emergent imaging with Doppler ultrasound seems to be the most helpful in confirming the diagnosis. Radionuclide testicular scintigraphy with 99mTc is helpful when past the acute phase (the first 12 hours) and vascular compromise has prolonged. The clinician may attempt to manually reduce the torsion, but many need to be immediately referred to a urologist for a surgical exploration. Long-term prognosis for a functional, nonatrophied testicle is improved the sooner the torsion is diagnosed and treated."

We retrospectively reviewed 626 patients, who presented with acute scrotal pain between January 1998 and June 2004. Following history and physical examination, the patients either proceeded directly to surgery or underwent US examination. If clinical suspicion of testicular torsion persisted after US, the patients would still undergo scrotal exploration. Of the 294 patients who had routine scrotal exploration without preliminary US, only 23 (7.8%) were found to have testicular torsion. Amongst the 332 cases that had initial US, 9 (2.7%) patients revealed testicular torsion that was confirmed at subsequent surgery. The remaining 323 patients had initial negative US, but 29 were explored eventually on clinical indications. Of these, 4 (1.2% of 323) cases were diagnosed intra-operatively as testicular torsion. None of the remaining 294 patients who were managed conservatively proved to have testicular torsion after a minimum follow-up of 2 weeks. For testicular torsion, US yielded a sensitivity of 69.2% (95% confidence interval =38.9-89.5), specificity of 100% (95% CI=98.5-100), positive predictive value of 100% and negative predictive value of 97.5%.

In all cases the radiologist performed a complete baseline US survey and then decided whether or not to add a contrast-enhanced examination. All contrast-enhanced sonographic studies were completed proving to be adequate for diagnostic purposes and without adverse reactions to contrast medium. There were 40 true negatives. The final diagnosis, obtained in 85 positive cases out of 86, was: splenic injury (28 cases), hepatic injury (3), renal injury (3), multiple injuries (3), pancreatic and portal vein injury (1), colonic-mesocolic injury (1), testicular trauma (1), hepatic abscess (9), hepatic ischaemia (1), gangrenous cholecystitis (1), splenic infarction (8), splenic haematoma abscess (1), renal infection (4), renal infarction (1), necrotizing pancreatitis (1), post-biopsy haemorrhage (1), appendicitis (2), peritoneal abscesses (1), testicular torsion (6), orchiepididymitis (1), iliac artery dissection (1), ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (6), aortic periprosthetic hemorrhage (1). Out of 85 positive cases, agreement between baseline US and contrast-specific US was absent in 8% of cases, low in 26%, intermediate in 42%, and high in 24%. Baseline US had 3 false positives. Relevance of contrast-specific US was absent in 17% of cases, low (additional data not relevant for patient management) in 26%, intermediate (relevant additional data not modifying patient management) in 34%, and high (additional data modifying patient management) in 23%. Agreement between contrast-specific US and the gold standards was absent in 0% of cases, low in 6%, intermediate in 38%, and high in 56%. Contrast-specific US had 2 false positive results. Real-time contrast-specific US is an effective technique in emergency imaging. Its role should not be considered as a replacement of CT (though in some instances it can be considered a valuable alternative) but as a useful integration of conventional US. By always having the opportunity to add contrast-enhanced imaging, in case of interpretation doubts or diagnostic difficulties, the radiologist can assess the emergency patient with improved confidence and skill."

We determine whether direct visualization of the twisted cord during emergency high resolution ultrasonography (HRUS) is a reliable sign to diagnose the torsion and whether its absence can dispense with unnecessary surgery. From 1993 to 2002 an average of 35 patients per year presented with acute scrotum, and 44 patients had spermatic cord torsion. CDS and HRUS were performed in all cases. Transversal and longitudinal scans on both sides of the scrotum permitted comparison of testicular echogenicity, size and vascularization. The spermatic cord was studied along its complete length to detect spiral twist. The surgical findings were correlated with the preoperative results. Spermatic cord torsion at surgery was confirmed in all 44 cases. The time lost by the examination was never more than 30 minutes. Intratesticular blood flow was absent in the affected testis in 31 cases, and CDS was unreliable in the others. In all cases, regardless of CDS findings, HRUS succeeded in detecting the twist as a snail shell-shaped mass measuring 11 to 33 mm. The finding of a twisted spermatic cord is a highly reliable sign for the diagnosis of testicular torsion. Whereas normal intratesticular perfusion does not dispense with emergency exploratory surgery, direct and complete visualization of a nontwisted spermatic cord strongly indicates that surgery is unnecessary. Strict conditions are required, including time spent on HRUS should not exceed 30 minutes, which generally can only be achieved by a senior pediatric radiologist."

    "abstract": "Testis torsion is a surgical emergency that lead to permanent gonad damage. The damage has been ascribed to mechanisms of ischemia-reperfusion similar to other tissues. The mechanisms involved are different, but the lipid peroxidation of plasma membrane, caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated particularly during reperfusion, is one of the most accredited. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of raxofelast, a vitamin E-like antioxidant with potent action and no systemic toxicity, on lipid peroxidation and histopathology in both testes after unilateral testicular torsion and detorsion. Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to total occlusion (3 h) of the left testis followed by 4 hours of reperfusion (TI/R). Sham testicular ischemia-reperfusion rats (SHAM TI/R) were used as controls. The animals were then randomized to receive either vehicle (1 ml/kg/i.p. of a dimetylsulphoxide/NaCl 0.9% 1:10 v/v solution, injected either 15 min before detorsion and 15 min after detorsion) or raxofelast (20 mg/kg i.p. 15 min before detorsion and 15 min after detorsion). Conjugated dienes (CD) levels, an index of lipid peroxidation, and testis histopathology were evaluated. Testicular ischemia reperfusion (TI/R) in untreated rats produced high testicular levels of CD (3.6+/-0.3 DeltaABS/g protein on the left side and 2.5+/-0.2 DeltaABS/g protein on the right side). Furthermore, histological examination revealed marked damage to the testis interstitium with severe haemorrhage and edema. The administration of raxofelast lowered CD levels (2.8+/-0.2 DeltaABS/g protein on the left side and 1.9+/-0.1 DeltaABS/g protein in the right side) and significantly reduced histological damage. These data suggest that the hydrophilic vitamin E-like antioxidants are good candidates for designing a novel therapeutic strategy to halt the oxidative stress that follows acute testis torsion."

Modem ultrasound examination of the scrotum is the test of choice for acute scrotal pathology and yields high accuracy compared with surgical exploration. A key component of the testicular examination is use of power and spectral Doppler ultrasonography. Examination of the acute scrotum should not be undertaken unless Doppler capability is available because the evaluation of blood flow is such an important part of diagnosis of testicular torsion, orchitis, epididymitis,trauma, and hemorrhage into a mass."

Signs and symptoms of testicular pathologies can overlap, making diagnosis problematic. However, key features can raise the NP's index of suspicion for a particular diagnosis and can assist in selecting the most appropriate management strategy. Although these conditions are rarely fatal, they may carry a risk of morbidity in the form of testicular necrosis, infarction, or atrophy with concomitant infertility. Any patient with scrotal or testicular pain should be presumed to have testicular torsion until proven otherwise, as this condition carries a high degree of morbidity. The information gained through a thorough history and physical examination can assist in arriving at the proper diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Acute scrotum in children is generally a symptom. Several pathologies of the testis, scrotum or groin may cause it, including inflammatory as well as ischaemic processes. Testicular torsion with ischaemia of the testis is an emergency requiring prompt surgical intervention. Even experienced paediatric surgeons and urologists may have difficulties differentiating an ischaemic from an inflammatory aetiology solely on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms. In cases of aetiologic uncertainty, operative exploration has to be performed to rule out ischaemia, which led in the past to a high rate of surgery. More recently, colour Doppler ultrasonography (CDUS) has become an imaging modality for the examination of the acute scrotum with the purpose of detecting ischaemia, thus reducing the need for explorative surgery. In this study we examined the reliability of CDUS, comparing the sonographical diagnoses with both the intraoperative findings and the clinical course. We present here 132 consecutive cases of acute scrotum in children, who were admitted from 01/98 through 10/02 to our hospital. All patients underwent CDUS. Patients with ultrasonographic signs of ischaemia of the testis (group A) and patients with demonstrated perfusion and suspicious or severe clinical symptoms (group B) were operated immediately. Patients with demonstrated perfusion without suspicious or severe symptoms (group C) were treated conservatively. Thirty-eight patients (28.8%) were treated operatively. Eleven cases of testicular torsion in group A (12 pat.) could be confirmed intraoperatively, in one case there was no testicular torsion but a severe inflammation of the testis with torsion of the appendix testis. In group B (26 pat.) operative exploration revealed one case of testicular torsion. In group B two cases of sonographically suspected torsions of the appendix testis also emerged as epididymitis intraoperatively. In the other cases postoperative diagnosis was in agreement with the preoperative CDUS. The clinical course of 94 conservatively treated patients (71.2%) (group C) confirmed in all cases a non-ischaemic aetiology. There was a total of 12 cases (9.1%) where acute scrotum was caused by testicular torsions. This relatively low rate underlines the necessity to differentiate between ischaemic and other aetiologies, thus avoiding operation in many patients. 71.2% of our patients could be treated conservatively. However, it is essential to exclude an ischaemic cause before opting for conservative therapy. Even though CDUS is a very valuable diagnostic tool in this sense, this exclusion cannot be ensured in every case and is highly dependent on the expertise and technique of the investigator. Therefore in cases with any doubts an operative exploration has to be performed to avoid the most dreaded complication in the treatment of acute scrotum."

All cases were diagnosed after a normal testicular examination by a neonatologist, and all patients underwent urgent exploration to confirm the exact diagnosis and attempt testicular salvage by detorsion with bilateral orchiopexy. If a nonviable testis was determined intraoperatively, it was removed and contralateral orchiopexy was performed. Success was determined by physical examination at 6 months of follow-up. Ten patients with 10 affected testes were identified and a total of 4 (40%) were salvaged. All the studied testes were right-sided, and of the 4 salvaged testes, all were palpably normal and equal in size to their mate at the 6-month follow-up examination. Of the 6 removed testes, 1 was potentially viable by permanent pathologic section analysis despite preoperative ultrasonography demonstrating no flow and a negative intraoperative bleed test. Boys younger than 30 days old presenting with clinical findings suggestive of extravaginal testicular torsion who are expeditiously explored surgically may have a salvageable event in at least 40% to 50%.

Variables assessed included presenting symptoms, age, size, lie and position of the testis when supine and erect, the operative findings and follow-up. Eight children had at least two previous episodes of testicular pain; four of these were admitted on six occasions. Two had undergone previous scrotal exploration. On clinical examination, six boys had a transverse testicle and two a discrepancy in testicular size. All children had their testes fixed. At operation in all patients there was abnormal attachment of the tunica vaginalis with a typical 'bell clapper' deformity. On follow-up only one patient still complains of pain.

We studied the preoperative examinations, the operative data and the long term evolution. Cases of torsion occurring during neonatal or pubertal periods were excluded. During nine years, 86 patients with \"acute scrotum symptoms\" underwent surgery. The ages of patients ranged from one month to 11 years (average age: five years) in 26 patients, among which 12 had true testicular torsion. Consultation at the emergency room occurred after one to 72 hours (average of 17). The localization of the pain was on the left in eight cases and on ectopic testicle in two. The testicular volume was increased in 11 cases. Cremasteric reflex was absent in four cases. The doppler flow was normal in four cases and absent in four. During surgery, the testis appearance was considered as normal in six testicles, as necrotized in three (and an orchidectomy was performed) and as ischemic in three. In seven cases, a peroperative contralateral testicle fixation was performed and later one in two. The postoperative course was simple, without infection and with a normal testicular volume in eight cases, increased in one ischemic testis. Testicular atrophy was noted in an ischemic testis, after several months. Whatever the age, testicular torsion remains a surgical emergency even with a normal doppler flow."

The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate and compare the value of Tc-99m pertechnetate radionuclide imaging and ultrasonography in the differentiation of acute testicular torsion and inflammatory testicular diseases. Twenty patients (age range, 5 to 38 years) with possible acute testicular torsion from July 2000 to July 2001 were enrolled in this study. Ultrasonography was performed in all patients in the emergency room. Within 3 hours of ultrasonography, radionuclide imaging was also performed after intravenous injection of 5 to 15 mCi Tc-99m pertechnetate in the forearms. All of the patients with clinically suspected acute testicular torsion underwent surgery. The surgical findings and pathologic reports of these patients were reviewed and definite diagnoses were established. None of the other patients had surgery and were followed clinically for at least 1 month after ultrasonography and radionuclide imaging. Four patients with testicular torsion, 13 patients with inflammatory testicular disease, and three healthy persons had a final surgical and pathologic diagnosis or clinical follow-up, and all were accurately diagnosed by Tc-99m pertechnetate radionuclide imaging. In contrast, ultrasonography was less accurate in the diagnosis and differentiation of acute testicular torsion from inflammation. Only 1 of 4 patients with testicular torsion, 5 of 13 patients with inflammatory testicular disease, and 2 of 3 healthy persons were diagnosed by ultrasonography. The results indicate that Tc-99m pertechnetate radionuclide imaging is a more useful and accurate imaging method than ultrasonography in the detection and differentiation of acute testicular torsion from inflammatory testicular disease in patients with acute scrotal pain."

To determine the accuracy with which emergency physicians (EPs) using bedside ultrasonography are able to evaluate patients presenting to the ED with acute scrotal pain. The study was performed at an urban community hospital ED with a residency program and an annual census of 70,000. A retrospective chart review identified 36 patients who presented with complaints of acute scrotal pain and were evaluated by EPs using bedside ultrasound. A 5.0- or 7.5-MHz linear-array transducer with color and power Doppler capability was used to scan the scrotum. Patients were seen between July 1998 and September 1999. Diagnoses were verified by radiology or surgery. Sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. The EP ultrasound examinations agreed with confirmatory studies for 35 of 36 patients, resulting in a sensitivity of 95% (95% CI = 0.78 to 0.99) and a specificity of 94% (95% CI = 0.72 to 0.99). Diagnoses included three testicular torsions, six cases of epididymitis, four cases of orchitis, one testicular fracture, three hernias, three hydroceles, and 15 normal examinations. One case of epididymitis was misdiagnosed as an epididymal mass. This study suggests that EPs using bedside ultrasonography are able to accurately diagnose patients presenting with acute scrotal pain.

    "abstract": "Scrotal pathology in pediatrics ranges from the more benign hydrocele and varicocele to acute testicular torsion requiring emergent surgery. Malignant testicular tumors can be insidious in onset or may present acutely when trauma brings a swollen scrotum to the patient's or physician's attention. Three common conditions can present as an acute scrotum, all of which can suggest testicular torsion clinically. Epididymitis often has a less acute onset than testicular torsion, although it does not always present with a straightforward diagnosis. Although it is generally an inflammatory process affecting males from 9 to 14 years of age, it can be seen in younger males with Henoch-Schonlein purpura and Kawasaki disease. Torsion of the appendix of the testis and epididymis can present acutely and mimic acute testicular torsion and generally occurs from 6 to 12 years of age. Testicular torsion itself usually occurs from 12 to 18 years of age and usually results from the anatomical \"bell-and-clapper\" deformity. Infarction of the testis can occur within as early as 4 to 6 hours after torsion, depending on the duration of symptoms and degree of twist of the spermatic cord. Advances in ultrasound technology in recent years have made ultrasound the examination of choice for imaging scrotal pathology, whether acute or chronic in nature. Doppler technology has tremendously increased the radiologist's ability to assess flow within the prepubertal testicle, which allows assessment of viability in the undescended testis as well as in neonatal torsion. The ability of ultrasound to diagnose the pathogenesis of the acute scrotum is unsurpassed by any other imaging modality. Ultrasound is a readily available, noninvasive examination without radiation that provides excellent anatomic detail and serves as an important and tremendously helpful imaging modality in all types of pediatric scrotal pathology."

    "abstract": "To present a case of torsion of a nonneoplastic intra-abdominal testis with an unusual clinical presentation.A 26-year-old active duty Navy Petty Officer presented to the emergency department on 3 occasions over a 5-day period with lower abdominal pain. Physical examination demonstrated acute tenderness in the left lower quadrant with sugestion of a normal spermatic cord and atrophic testis in the left scrotum. Computed tomography scan demonstrated an intra-abdominal lesion near the internal inguinal ring. The patient underwent surgical exploration through an inguinal incision. Torsion of a nonviable intra-abdominal testis was present. The scrotum contained only the vas deferens and cremasteric muscle. An orchiectomy was performed with removal of the vas deferens and other cord structures.The unusual clinical finding of acute torsion of an intra-abdominal testis, associated with an apparent atrophic scrotal testis, presented a confusing clinical picture. Computed tomography scan did not clarify the issue sufficiently to establish a definite preoperative diagnosis. Clinical suspicion prompted early surgical intervention. Review of the current literature produced 60 reported cases of torsion of an intra-abdominal testis. Two thirds of these involved testicular neoplasm, usually seminoma. Although the clinical presentation varied, most patients had recent onset of lower abdominal pain associated with tenderness and, in half the cases, a mass. Patients almost always presented with an absent scrotal testis on the involved side, and not infrequently reported previous surgery thought to be an orchiectomy.Diagnosis of an intra-abdominal testicular torsion is rare, particularly when no neoplasm is present. A high index of suspicion must be maintained whenever there is abdominal pain and undescended testis. The surgical history and imaging studies may not clarify a confusing clinical picture."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion requires emergent release of the twisted spermatic cord. Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) plays an important role in its pathogenesis, and recent data suggest that germ cells undergo apoptosis during I/R. In a model of torsion/detorsion (i.e., I/R) of the rat testis, involvement of calpain and caspase in necrotic and apoptotic cell death was examined. After 1 h of ischemia followed by 0, 0.5, 1, 6, or 24 h of reperfusion, the germ cells positively stained with in situ TUNEL, and DNA fragmentation, activation of caspase-3, and proteolysis of caspase substrates increased with time of reperfusion, demonstrating apoptosis. In addition, m-calpain activation and proteolysis of alpha-fodrin were increased during reperfusion, and its activation is thought to be involved in the necrosis. A calpain inhibitor, acety-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal, inhibited the phenomena associated with apoptosis and necrosis induced by I/R, although a caspase inhibitor, Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethlyketone, only inhibited apoptotic changes. The inhibition of calpain but not caspase ameliorated the injury after 60 days of reperfusion following 1 h of ischemia. The calpain inhibitor injected just before reperfusion effectively suppressed alpha-fodrin proteolysis, suggesting its usefulness in the treatment of testicular torsion."

Twenty-five patients with acute scrotal pain were prospectively enrolled over a two-year period. History, physical examination, complete blood count, urinalysis, and scrotal ultrasound were performed. Testicular torsion was confirmed by surgical exploration. Epididymitis was diagnosed using physical examination, scrotal ultrasound, and positive urinalysis. Venous blood was assayed for IL-1, IL-6, and CPK-MM in triplicate during the routine drawing of blood in the emergency department. The data are reported as medians +/- interquartile ranges (IQRs). Twenty-five patients with acute scrotal pain were evaluated; 11 with TT, three with torsion of the appendix testis (TAT), ten with epididymitis, and one with varicocele. One patient had both TT and epididymitis. Interleukin-1 was not detectable in either group. The CPK-MM values between TT and epididymitis were virtually identical at 99.8 and 100 IU/L, respectively. The median value for IL-6 was 1. 03 (IQR = 0.19 to 2.86) vs 20.86 (IQR = 2.14 to 65.50) pg/mL in the torsion and epididymitis groups, respectively. The 97.5% CI for the difference of medians of 19.9 was 0.4 to 65.1, p = 0.02. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for IL-6, the area under the curve was 0.82 for torsion and 0.67 for epididymitis. Using a cutoff value of IL-6 >/= 1.41 pg/mL, the positive predictive value of IL-6 in diagnosing epididymitis was 78.6%, with a negative predictive value of 100% for TT. There were no cases of missed TT on follow-up. This preliminary investigation of serologic markers demonstrates that IL-6 is significantly elevated in epididymitis as compared with TT. Creatine phosphokinase-MM and IL-1 were not found to be of diagnostic utility. The small sample size of this study precludes a definitive conclusion as to the utility of these markers in the emergency department. However, IL-6 may be clinically useful as an additional element in differentiating the causes of acute scrotal pain, and further study is warranted."

    "abstract": "Evaluation of acute painful scrotum is difficult and imaging studies have been reported to be unreliable in detecting testicular torsion. In order to assess the value of color Doppler sonography in acute scrotal disease, the authors reviewed 65 consecutive boys, ranging in age from 1 to 16 years. The study demonstrated absent or diminished flow signals in 11 patients. All of them had a surgical intervention, and in 8 of them, a testicular torsion was confirmed. 54 boys had a symmetrical or increased flow signal on the affected side. Just 5 boys among this group underwent surgical exploration. On follow up, none of the 54 patients with good flow signals proved to have a testicular torsion. Sonography and color Doppler sonography helped to differentiate epididymitis and torsion of a testicular appendage as a basis for further investigations and correct conservative therapy. In detecting a testicular torsion, color Doppler sonography yielded a positive predictive value of 73%, a sensitivity of 100% and a negative predictive value of 100%. We therefore conclude, that Doppler sonography can reliably rule out testicular torsion so that routine scrotal exploration in cases of acute scrotum is no longer necessary. By reducing the number of emergency operations and hospitalization days, color Doppler sonography can cut down the total cost of managing acute painful scrotum in boys."

    "abstract": "Bilateral perinatal testicular torsion (PTT) is an extremely rare condition. A baby boy at the postnatal 28th hour presented with right scrotal erythema and swelling, and left hydrocele were detected. There were no systemic symptoms. Right hydrocele had been detected during prenatal ultrasonography at the 34th week of gestation. Emergency technetium Tc 99m pertechnetate scintigraphy showed hypoperfusion in both sides suggesting testicular torsion. The patient underwent surgery immediately. Right necrotic testis was removed, left testis was judged as viable, and thus was treated with detorsion. Bilateral PTT in the neonate is a true emergency because of the risk of anorchia. Controversy still exists regarding the treatment of unilateral PTT. Some investigators suggest delayed operation regarding the anesthetic risk imposed on the neonate and the reality that operative salvage of the prenatally torsed testicle is a remote possibility. However, although asynchronous bilateral PTT is rare, the patient with unilateral PTT is at risk of contralateral testicular torsion in the waiting period of delayed operation. Therefore, the authors recommend early surgical intervention."

In many institutions there are delays in obtaining Doppler or Scintigraphy studies during off-hours. We report two cases of testicular torsion diagnosed by the treating EPs using power Doppler in the emergency department (ED). Rapid diagnosis of torsion led to successful salvage of the affected testicle in both cases. These represent the first cases for emergency screening ultrasound examinations (ESUEs) of testicular torsion in the literature.

From 1992 to 1997, 130 patients (<23 years old) from 2 institutions underwent US imaging using a 7.5-mHz linear transducer to evaluate an acute scrotum equivocal, or of low suspicion, for torsion. The US reports and hospital charts of these patients were retrospectively reviewed. After clinical and radiologic evaluation, torsion was excluded in 110 patients without surgical exploration. In 3 patients, intermittent testicular torsion was diagnosed and in 17 patients, emergent exploration was performed for US diagnosis of testicular torsion. Twenty-five patients (22.7%) were subsequently lost to follow-up. Follow-up of 85 patients with US negative for torsion (mean length of follow-up = 466.9 days) revealed no testicular atrophy in 83. Two patients underwent delayed orchiectomy/contralateral orchiopexy for missed testicular torsion. Of 17 patients with US positive for torsion, 9 underwent orchiectomy for a necrotic torsed testis, 7 viable torsed testes were found, and 1 torsed appendix testis was found. Therefore, color Doppler US for the equivocal acute scrotum yielded a 1% false-positive rate, sensitivity of 88.9%, and specificity of 98.8%. When faced with ruling out testicular torsion, it is necessary to integrate the multiple pieces of patient data, knowing that each piece of data may have inaccuracies. With this in mind, this analysis of outcomes verifies that color Doppler US is an excellent adjunctive study in the clinically real situation in which the clinical evaluation is equivocal or low suspicion."

Most rarely it occurs as a result of a testicular trauma, orchitis, idiopathic scrotal edema, idiopathic infarction of testis and vaginalis tunica or testicular neoplasm; a spontaneous thrombosis of the spermatic vein vessels is quite unusual. A rare case of thrombosis of a dilated pampiniform plexus which occurred in a 6 year-old child is reported and its clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment is discussed. The difficulty in making such a diagnosis is stressed since thrombosis of the spermatic vein is quite a rare entity; a conservative approach is suggested as a treatment of choice whenever a definite diagnosis is made, otherwise surgical intervention (ligation of the spermatic vein, if necessary) is required in order to rule out any other urologic emergency."

The cause varied with patient age, with most TTs in newborns and boys of 15 years and most ATs in 10-11-year-olds; 21.5% were operated upon within 6 h of the onset of pain and 69.2% within 24 h. Most stayed in hospital for less than 24 h. Pre-surgical examination identified no criterion for excluding TT. We therefore believe that all children complaining of acute scrotal pain should undergo surgery.

In one child the right testis was enlarged and higher, but soft to firm, and the overlying skin was oedematous and red. The exploration revealed extravaginal torsion of the testis which was gangrenous in four; in one after detorsion there was haemorrhage and haematoma of the cord and the tunica, and the testis was slightly congested but not gangrenous. This testis was preserved and bilateral orchidopexies performed; at 18 months both testes are palpable and of normal size. In the remaining four children the testes were frankly necrotic; they underwent orchidectomy and contralateral orchidopexy. Histology in all four revealed a totally infarcted testis with extensive haemorrhage and vascular congestion. The early diagnosis and treatment of intra-uterine torsion of the testis is essential."

Torsion of the testis is a surgical emergency because the likelihood of testicular salvage decreases as the duration of torsion increases. Conditions that may mimic testicular torsion, such as torsion of a testicular appendage, epididymitis, trauma, hernia, hydrocele, varicocele and Schönlein-Henoch purpura, generally do not require immediate surgical intervention. The cause of an acute scrotum can usually be established based on a careful history, a thorough physical examination and appropriate diagnostic tests. The onset, character and severity of symptoms must be determined. The physical examination should include inspection and palpation of the abdomen, testis, epididymis, scrotum and inguinal region. Urinalysis should always be performed, but scrotal imaging is necessary only when the diagnosis remains unclear. Once the correct diagnosis is established, treatment is usually straightforward."

Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) has shown benefits in previous musculoskeletal models of IR. We evaluated the efficacy of HBO treatment in a rat testicular torsion model. Four groups of male Wistar rats were included in this study: 1) Sham (n=16), spermatic cords exposed but not occluded; 2) Control (n=16), 4 hours of bilateral spermatic cord occlusion; 3) HBO during ischemia (n=18), 4 hours of occlusion and administration of HBO during the last 90 minutes of ischemia; and 4) HBO on reperfusion (n=8), HBO administered immediately upon reperfusion of the testes. The animals were sacrificed at two weeks and architecture and germinal epithelial cell thickness were determined by histological examination on each testicle. Average thickness (in cell layers) of each group was compared with control using Student's t test. Control testicles showed a significant reduction in germinal cell thickness compared with sham (1.7 versus 6.3, p <0.05). The animals treated with HBO during ischemia showed a significant increase in epithelial cell thickness compared with control (2.8 versus 1.7, p <0.05). Hyperbaric oxygen treatment during reperfusion had the greatest beneficial effect compared with control (5.1 versus 1.7, p <0.05). Adjunctive HBO therapy administered during ischemia or reperfusion significantly reduced injury to the testicle in this animal model. These results suggest a potential benefit of HBO treatment in clinical situations of testicular torsion."

Our knowledge of this condition, however, is of relatively recent origin. We performed an historical survey of torsion of the scrotal organs dating back to 1703. In Bologna in 1703 Morgagni observed the first hydatid on the caput epididymis. He described 10 hydatid cases of the testis and epididymis producing, in his opinion, the fluid of hydroceles. The first illustration of appendix testis dates from Cooper 1841. Later these testicular appendages, or hydatids, were shown to be vestigial remnants of either the müllerian duct or the wolffian structures, depending on location. Actual torsion of the appendix testis was mentioned by Ombrédanne in 1913 but the first case report was published in 1922 by Colt. Appendix testis torsion was first schematically illustrated in 1923 by Mouchet and was characterized by Dix in 1931 in a manner that is still valid today. Interestingly, the great majority of case reports since 1932 have originated from America. In 1810 Hunter described a typical case of testicular torsion, and in 1840 Delasiauve presented the first case of surgically treated testicular torsion. A schematic and original illustration of a contorted undescended testis was published in 1894 by Lauenstein. Testicular torsion was, and still is, a true urological emergency but the historical survival rate of the testis was extremely low. Searching for improvement in clinical diagnosis, physicians have noted helpful specific signs, 1 of which is that the period of ischemia determines loss of the testis. The historical development of diagnosis of torsion of the appendix testis and spermatic cord highlights the ever present need for careful examination, a high index of suspicion and timely therapy."

Our protocol (Fig. 6) for the evaluation of these children is based on the history and physical examination combined with the selective use of imaging studies. When used appropriately, this protocol facilitates the rapid identification of children with torsion and minimizes the number of unnecessary scrotal explorations. When the duration of the pain is brief, and history and physical examination suggest that torsion is the most likely diagnosis, urgent surgical exploration without additional imaging studies is recommended. When it is not possible to definitely diagnose or exclude the diagnosis of testicular torsion, or when the duration of pain is greater than 12 hours, then diagnostic imaging can provide significant information. Color Doppler sonography is, in the authors' opinion, preferable to nuclear imaging for the evaluation of children with acute scrotums. When normal or increased blood flow is present, scrotal exploration is not required. When the study demonstrates decreased blood flow or does not provide a definite diagnosis, scrotal exploration is recommended. The authors recommend this approach because less than one third of these children have testicular torsion, and if routine scrotal exploration is performed for all boys with acute scrotums, a significant number of unnecessary surgical procedures will result."

Only 5% of scrotal torsions occurred in patients < 12 years of age, whereas 26% occurred in those > 20 years of age. In five of 82 cases (6%) of confirmed testicular torsion, the surgeon did not consider this the most likely diagnosis.

Over a period of 1 year, testicular Doppler ultrasonic assessment was performed on 56 patients admitted with acute scrotal pain. A hand-held Doppler ultrasound probe was used, with a transducer operating at 8 MHz. All the patients were assessed pre-operatively by a single operator in the Accident and Emergency department before transfer to theatre. The decision to explore the testis was made purely on clinical grounds by which ever emergency surgical team was on duty. The operating surgeons were not informed of the result of Doppler examinations before surgical exploration. Twenty-two patients were subsequently shown to have torsion of the testis at surgical exploration, all of whom had no Doppler signal over the affected side. Of the remaining 34 patients, who were subsequently shown not to have torsion at operation, normal testicular blood flow and cord-compression tests were demonstrated confidently in 33 patients when examined pre-operatively. Thus the sensitivity was 100% (22/22) and the specificity 97% (33/34). Testicular Doppler examination using an 8 MHz probe in conjunction with the cord-compression test is a useful, simple and highly accurate clinical tool which can differentiate between testicular torsion and other conditions presenting with acute testicular pain. It is also inexpensive and readily available in the district general hospital situation."

The use of real-time scrotal ultrasound for the diagnosis of testicular torsion has been described in the literature. A false-negative ultrasound examination can postpone the diagnosis of torsion and result in testicular loss. We examined 6 patients 1 day to 18 years old who had subacute testicular torsion with scrotal symptomatology (pain and/or swelling) for longer than 8 hours (range 12 hours to 6 days). Scrotal ultrasound was performed as 1 of the initial tests. A common sonographic pattern was an inhomogeneous testicle with hypoechoic areas alternating with hyperechoic areas and thickening of adjacent scrotal tissue. Another common finding was an edematous hyperechoic epididymis and a small hydrocele. In 4 of the 6 cases these nonspecific findings suggested a misleading diagnosis of tumor or epididymitis and resulted in delay of surgery and testicular loss. Treatment was not delayed in only 2 patients in whom the diagnosis of torsion was made initially by history and physical examination, and ultrasound was done for interest only. Misdiagnosis of intratesticular blood flow and some potential pitfalls of scrotal imaging by color Doppler ultrasound are discussed. We conclude that real-time scrotal sonography can be misleading in cases of subacute testicular torsion and, therefore, it should not be used in this clinical setting."

We report our experience in paediatric patients presenting acute scrotum. Thirty consecutive cases were examined, but three were discarded because of their non-routine features. Our records show that torsion of the appendix testis is far from uncommon (6 cases out of 27); however, the scintigraphic pattern of this pathological condition, which usually does not require urgent surgical treatment, does not seem to differ greatly from that of scrotal inflammation. Of the remaining 21 cases, 15 were correctly diagnosed, while 4 were to be considered non-diagnostic because of the presence of hypovascular scrotal conditions other than testicular torsion. We conclude that, while not always a very precise tool for the diagnosis of acute scrotum, nevertheless testicular scan results may be considered a useful parameter in choosing the proper type of treatment."

Although damage to the gonad has been well documented, it remains unknown whether the majority of injury occurs during the period of torsion (ischemia) or following detorsion (reperfusion). The aims of this study were to determine: (1) whether damage following testicular torsion-detorsion has a reperfusion component similar to that described in other tissues, and (2) whether iron-catalyzed oxygen radical formation or altered calcium homeostasis plays a role in this injury. To study this, anesthetized prepubertal rats underwent 720 degrees intravaginal testicular torsion and were divided into groups of torsion only (ischemia) and torsion with reperfusion (ischemia/reperfusion). Reperfusion groups were treated prior to detorsion with either deferoxamine (iron chelator), diltiazem (calcium channel blocker), or saline vehicle. The results indicated that detorsion produces a qualitatively distinct reperfusion injury from that of non-reperfused testicles; however, such damage was not ameliorated by deferoxamine or diltiazem. Thus, testicular torsion-detorsion appears to have a significant reperfusion component that appears to not be mediated by iron-catalyzed oxygen radical formation or calcium injury."

Torsion of testicular appendages, a self limiting condition, tended to present later than testicular torsion (P = 0.002). The testis was saved in all 11 cases of testicular torsion explored within 12h of the onset of pain but orchidectomy was required in four who presented later. In 11 cases, a torted testicular appendage diagnosed as a tender nodule was found on examining the upper pole of the testis. The remaining 14 cases of torted appendage were diagnosed at operation because testicular torsion could not be excluded due to scrotal swelling. Most (12) of this operated group were not seen until 3 days after the onset of pain. This study suggested that urgent operation was unnecessary in those in whom a tender nodule was found (pathognomonic of a torted appendage) and in those presenting after more than 24h of pain with scrotal erythema and oedema. The likely diagnosis in the latter case is a torted appendage and in cases of torsion of the testis there is no prospect of salvage at this stage. These guidelines were applied to a group of 20 boys studied prospectively. In eight, all with less than 24h of pain, immediate exploration was undertaken and testicular torsion was confirmed in six. The remaining 12 fulfilled the criteria for conservative management and were observed. All had normal testes at late review. Careful clinical assessment in boys with scrotal pain indicates which cases may be treated by non-operative management without fear of losing a salvageable testis."

Prolonged torsion usually results in unilateral testicular atrophy and, in postpubertal animals, an autoimmune injury with consequent contralateral testicular damage is seen. This suggests that, in humans, necrotic and perhaps marginal testes should be removed. In addition, subfertility after unilateral torsion may be due to a preexisting abnormality in both testes.

In only two patients did the interpretation differ from the ultimate clinical impression. In one, the torsion had relieved itself before the scan was performed and at operation the testis had adequate perfusion. In the second, clinically suspected epididymitis was not confirmed.

The risk of a male developing torsion of the testis or its appendix by the age of 25 is about 1 in 160. Both conditions occurred primarily in adolescents, but among prepubertal boys torsion of an appendage was as common as torsion of a normally descended testis. There was a slight left-sided preponderance in testicular torsion, more marked in torsion of the appendages; the incidence of bilateral torsion was 2-0 and 1-8 per cent respectively. The clinical features and differential diagnosis of the two conditions are compared. Torsion of a testicular appendage is the most commonly misdiagnosed scrotal lesion, the preoperative diagnosis being correct in only 11 per cent of cases compared with 90 per cent for torsion of the testis. Twenty-one cases of recurrent torsion underwent prophylactic bilateral orchidopexy. There were 20 cases of torsion of undescended testes, with a salvage rate of only 20 per cent. The overall testicular survival rate was 55-3 per cent. Viability depends upon the possibility of spontaneous reduction, the preoperative delay after the onset of symptoms, the degree of torsion of the cord and the length of follow-up in doubtful cases. Urgent scrotal exploration is advised in every case of acute testicular pain unless there is overwhelming evidence of epididymoorchitis. Exploration of the opposite side is mandatory in torsion of the testis and advisable in torsion of an appendage."

    "abstract": "Infiltration of the spermatic cord with procaine was used in two cases in differentiating torsion of the testis from acute epididymitis. Detorsion was accomplished by manipulation during anesthesia, making it possible to do a corrective operation at a convenient time rather than carry it out as an emergency measure."

    "abstract": "Emergency laparotomy and its perioperative care is associated with high morbidity and mortality. At our institution, 30-day mortality was approximately 12% in 2013-2017. We introduced a perioperative protocol for emergency laparotomies in 2019. Retrospective cohort of emergency laparotomies 2019-2022. Reoperations, trauma and converted laparoscopies (appendectomy and cholecystectomy) were excluded. Primary outcome was mortality at 30, 90, and 180 days. Secondary outcomes were postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo; CD) and hospital-based outcomes. Six hundred eighty-two patients undergoing emergency laparotomy were included. Age was 72 (IQR 23) years and 66.4% (n = 453) were aged ≥ 65 years 56.6% (n = 386) were ASA class III or IV and 6.5% (n = 44) were not living at home at admission. The most frequent surgical findings were bowel obstruction (64.2%; n = 438) and gastrointestinal perforations (n = 134; 19.4%). Stoma creation (29.9%; n = 204), adhesiolysis (28.6%; n = 195), and anastomosis (27.4%; n = 187) were common. Mortality at 30 days was 6.9% (n = 47), 90 days 11.0% (n = 75), and 180 days 12.8% (n = 87). Mortality was higher for patients ≥ 80 years than < 65 years (23.9% vs. 4.4%; p < 0.001). Mortality predictors were admission not from home (p = 0.043), disseminated cancer (p < 0.001), and septic shock (p = 0.003) or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (p = 0.017). CD IIIb-IVb occurred in 81 patients (11.9%). ICU admission was 16.6% (n = 113) and LOS 8 (IQR 7) days. Mortality and complication rates after the introduction of a perioperative emergency laparotomy protocol were low despite a comorbid aged-patient cohort. Particular focus on the elderly, frail, and septic patients considered for emergency laparotomy is recommended."

    "abstract": "Timely access to emergency surgical care is a key metric for health system development and performance. To mitigate the risks of rural hospital closures in the United States, the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act introduced the rural emergency hospital (REH) designation, which promotes closure of inpatient units in small hospitals in favor of emergency and outpatient services via supplemental funding and reimbursement. We investigated trauma and emergency general surgery volumes at REH-eligible hospitals to evaluate the potential impact of REH designation on trauma and emergency general surgery care. We used the 2021 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project from five geographically diverse states (California, Florida, Iowa, Maryland, and Wisconsin) to select encounters where adult patients were treated for acute injuries or emergency general surgery conditions. We then identified REH-eligible hospitals (critical access hospitals or rural hospitals with <50 inpatient beds), comparing case volumes and patient populations at REH-eligible and -ineligible hospitals. We analyzed 2.1 million encounters. Trauma and emergency general surgery encounters at REH-eligible hospitals demonstrated substantial interstate variation, comprising 2% to 37% of statewide hospitalizations and up to 17% of statewide inpatient days, with rural states showing the highest proportions. Compared with ineligible hospitals, REH-eligible hospitals treated a higher proportion of patients who were White (85% vs. 55%), were living in rural areas (79% vs. 8%), and had lower incomes; treated fewer patients operatively (2% vs. 11%); and transferred more patients (5% vs. 3%) (all p < 0.001). Hospitals eligible for REH designation contribute substantially to the care of injured and emergency general surgery patients, although this is variable across states. While this policy may preserve emergency services in rural areas, the substantial variation in REH-eligible hospital utilization and the vulnerable populations served necessitate systematic evaluation of impacts on surgical access, transfer protocols, and regional care capacity given the irreversible structural changes inherent in this designation.

    "title": "What's the Rush? Challenging the Early Surgery Paradigm for Older Adults in Emergency General Surgery.",
    "abstract": "Rising patient volumes and an aging population are leading to difficulties in providing timely surgical intervention in emergency general surgery (EGS). With decreased resilience and greater comorbidity burden, we hypothesized that older adults would be disproportionately affected by longer preoperative wait times compared to younger adults. This retrospective cohort study compared older (≥65 years) to younger adults (16-64 years) who were urgently/emergently admitted between 2016-2020 to undergo one of the seven most common EGS operations using the Virginia Health Information Patient Level Database. Propensity score matching (1:1 nearest neighbor) analyzed the association between delayed time from admission to operation (≥2 days) and the outcomes of postoperative length of stay (POLOS), readmission, inpatient mortality, and total hospital charges, stratifying by older versus younger adults. Controls included demographics, insurance, socioeconomic status, comorbidities, and operative approach. Effect sizes were reported as average treatment effects (ATE) with 95% confidence intervals. Among 40,502 patients, 14,779 (36.5%) were aged ≥65 years. Delayed surgery occurred in 43.3% of older and 29.8% of younger adults. After matching, delayed surgery in younger adults was associated with increased readmission (ATE=3.5% [2.1-4.9%]) and longer POLOS (ATE=0.26 days [0.05-0.47]). Conversely, delayed surgery in older adults was not associated with readmission (ATE=-0.1% [-1.7-1.4%]) and linked to shorter POLOS (ATE=-0.45 days [-0.70 - -0.21]). Both age groups experienced similar increases in hospital charges (ATE ≈ $13,500), and mortality was not associated with surgical timing. Contrary to our hypothesis, delayed surgery was associated with worse outcomes for younger but not older adults. These findings challenge the prevailing urgency paradigm in EGS and suggest that preoperative optimization may mitigate risks in older adults."

    "abstract": "Indocyanine Green (ICG) fluorescence imaging is increasingly used in emergency bowel surgery to assess intestinal perfusion. While literature reports high technical efficacy, intraoperative interpretation remains variable. This systematic review explores how cognitive and systemic human factors influence ICG's perceived effectiveness, compared to reported quantitative outcomes. A systematic search of PubMed and Embase identified 31 original studies from 266 screened articles. Qualitative synthesis was guided by ENTREQ principles. Bias identification followed a thematic approach using cognitive bias categories based on established clinical decision-making frameworks. ICG was reported to influence surgical decision-making in 302 of 308 cases. However, discrepancies between fluorescence findings and clinical actions occurred in 38.3% of cases. Common cognitive patterns included confirmation and anchoring bias, overconfidence in fluorescence interpretation, and reliance on ICG to support pre-established surgical decisions. Systemic limitations included lack of interdisciplinary input, case-report bias, and absence of standardized interpretation protocols. These were analyzed across a full article-by-article bias matrix and summarized by domain and sentiment. ICG is not solely a diagnostic tool, but a cognitive interface shaped by time pressure, decision momentum, and human interpretation. Rather than providing objective certainty, ICG often reinforces existing clinical judgments. Addressing bias-awareness and integrating interdisciplinary frameworks may enhance interpretive consistency and improve patient outcomes. These findings call for greater cognitive standardization in the intraoperative use of ICG during emergency surgery."

    "abstract": "Immigrants to Canada face unique barriers that result in them accessing publicly funded healthcare services differently than non-immigrants. These barriers are particularly critical in the context of Emergency General Surgery (EGS) where timely access to healthcare is essential for better health outcomes. This study compares preoperative healthcare utilization between immigrants undergoing EGS with non-immigrants. EGS procedures in British Columbia between 2013 and 2021 were analyzed using population-based linked immigration, physician billing, and hospital discharge summary data. Preoperative primary care visits, specialist consults, imaging, and emergency department (ED) visits in the one-year period preceding the EGS were compared between immigrants with non-immigrants. Sub-analyses examined years since immigration and ethnic minority status. Of 77,937 EGS procedures, immigrants accounted for 14.6%. Immigrants had fewer pre-operative primary care visits (RR: 0.94, 95%CI: 0.92-0.96), specialist consults (RR: 0.88, 95%CI: 0.85-0.91), imaging services (RR: 0.96, 95%CI: 0.93-0.99), and ED visits (RR: 0.70, 95%CI: 0.68-0.72). Within the immigrant cohort, fewer primary care and ED visits were observed among the newest immigrants and among ethnic minorities. Immigrants accessed fewer healthcare services in the period preceding their EGS. Differences were most pronounced among new immigrants and immigrants from culturally-diverse countries who may be unfamiliar with the structure or processes for accessing healthcare services. Policy interventions are needed to prospectively link immigrants at highest risk of EGS with appropriate health services."

    "title": "Is robotic surgery ready for emergency cholecystectomy? A systematic review and meta-analysis of robotic versus laparoscopic approach in acute cholecystitis.",
    "abstract": "Acute cholecystitis is typically managed with laparoscopic cholecystectomy, though inflammation and distorted anatomy can increase operative difficulty. Robotic cholecystectomy may offer technical advantages through improved visualisation and instrument dexterity, yet current evidence is limited, heterogeneous, and entirely observational, with no randomized trials comparing the two approaches in the emergency setting. This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesises existing comparative data to determine whether robotic assistance confers meaningful operative or postoperative benefits over standard laparoscopy in acute cholecystitis. A PRISMA-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis was performed. Comprehensive searches of major databases (2015-2025) identified comparative studies of robotic versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute/emergency cholecystitis in adults. Eligible studies reported at least one perioperative or postoperative outcome; elective, paediatric, single-incision, and non-comparative designs were excluded. Outcomes included operative time, conversion, intra-operative complications, bile duct injury, length of stay, readmission, reoperation, and mortality. Risk of bias was assessed using ROBINS-I. Meta-analyses were conducted in RevMan using random-effects models, with heterogeneity assessed by I² and standard continuity corrections applied for zero-event studies. Seven observational studies comprising 143,717 patients met the inclusion criteria. Operative time and length of stay could not be meta-analysed due to inconsistent reporting and were therefore summarised narratively, with both outcomes appearing broadly comparable between robotic and laparoscopic groups. Meta-analysis demonstrated a significantly lower risk of conversion to open surgery with robotic cholecystectomy (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.50-0.75; I² = 44%). No significant differences were observed between robotic and laparoscopic approaches for intra-operative complications (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.38-1.36; I² = 40%), bile duct injury (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77-1.21; I² = 0%), overall postoperative complications (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.80-1.52; I² = 95%), 30-day readmission (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.50-1.54; I² = 18%), reintervention or return to theatre (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.04-2.48; I² = 78%), or 30-day mortality (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.86-1.90; I² = 0%). Event rates for bile duct injury, major complications, reintervention, and mortality were uniformly low across all cohorts, limiting the precision of pooled estimates. Risk-of-bias assessment using ROBINS-I indicated a moderate to serious overall risk of bias in six of the seven studies, primarily due to residual confounding, non-random treatment allocation, and incomplete reporting of disease severity and operative complexity. Robotic cholecystectomy is a safe and feasible alternative to laparoscopy for acute cholecystitis, demonstrating a consistent reduction in conversion to open surgery and comparable intra-operative and postoperative safety outcomes. However, as current evidence is limited to heterogeneous observational studies with incomplete clinical detail, robust prospective research-with detailed severity grading, surgeon-experience assessment, workflow evaluation, and cost-effectiveness analysis-is needed to more clearly define its role in emergency biliary surgery."

    "abstract": "Prior work has linked severe psychiatric illness (SPI) with greater postoperative mortality and complications following several elective operations. However, this relationship has not been defined in the setting of emergency general surgery (EGS). The 2016-2021 United States Nationwide Readmissions Database was used to identify all non-elective adult EGS hospitalizations performed within 48 h of admission. SPI was defined using ICD-10 codes for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Patients with severe psychiatric illness comprised the SPI cohort (others: Non-SPI). Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were developed to evaluate the independent association of severe psychiatric illness with in-hospital mortality, perioperative complications, and costs. Of 2,124,284 EGS patients, 52,130 (2.5 %) were categorized as SPI. On adjusted analysis, SPI was associated with greater odds of in-hospital mortality (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] 1.21; 95 % Confidence Interval [CI]:1.11-1.31), hospitalization costs (+$2304; 95 %CI: +1950, +2658), as well as a 3-fold increase in relative risk of non-home discharge (AOR 3.18, 95 % CI: 3.05-3.31). Among EGS patients, severe psychiatric illness was linked with inferior clinical and financial outcomes. Improved psychiatric screening and care may allow for early intervention and targeted postoperative care, potentially mitigating complications and costs for these vulnerable patients."

    "abstract": "The acute care surgery (ACS) model establishes the capacity to immediately accommodate nontraumatic emergency surgery requiring urgent treatment while simultaneously elevating the existing trauma care system to the highest level. This study aims to evaluate the 4-year experience of operating after expanding the trauma surgery domain to ACS at this institution, which was designated as a lower-level trauma center by the local government in 2020. A retrospective study was conducted using clinical records for patients who underwent surgery in the Division of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery over a 54-month period, from March 2021 to August 2025. Trauma volumes remained stable (10-20 cases semiannually) after ACS implementation, with surgical case numbers similar to those recorded before its introduction. Nontrauma volumes increased from 3 cases in March-August 2023 to 163 in March-August 2025. The transition from the trauma surgery model to the ACS model successfully increased the efficiency of trauma and emergency general surgery within the level II low-volume environment, accomplishing without reducing the existing trauma caseload. These findings support the adoption of ACS in similar emergency medical institutions and offer insights relevant for national policy development concerning emergency general surgery in Korea."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is one of the most common reasons for emergency general surgery, with more than 1 in 20 Americans expected to develop it during their lifetime. Despite its prevalence, there is significant variability in the treatment of acute appendicitis, particularly in the use of antibiotics, imaging modalities, and length of hospital stay. In 2016, our military medical institution established a novel Emergency General Surgery Performance Improvement program. As part of this initiative, we developed disease-specific protocols, including an outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy (OLA) protocol, to reduce treatment variability, improve efficiency, and optimize the quality of patient care. This is a 5-yreview of our appendectomy protocol. Our institution implemented an OLA, which outlined specific imaging and antibiotic administration, and minimized the hospital length of stay to within 24 h. Data from patients undergoing OLA between 2017 and 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Exclusion criteria included age < 18 y, advanced appendicitis, immunosuppression, pregnancy, or lack of postdischarge supervision. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square tests. Continuous variables (age, time to operating room [OR]) were tested for normality with the Shapiro-Wilk test and reported as median (Q1, Q3). Nonparametric comparisons across years used the Kruskal-Wallis test; 2020 (signage posted) was compared to other years using the Mann-Whitney U test. Significance was set at P < 0.05. A total of 104 patients met inclusion criteria (median age 35 y; 60% male). Antibiotic compliance ranged from 56% to 93%, and imaging compliance from 75% to 100%, both varying significantly over time (P = 0.014 and P = 0.039, respectively). Median time to OR remained stable at 7.0 h (interquartile range 6.0-10.0), with no significant yearly difference (P = 0.29). In 2020, signage was associated with higher antibiotic (P = 0.001) and imaging compliance (P = 0.001), but not shorter time to OR (P = 0.35). Complications were rare (2%). Despite variations in antibiotic and imaging compliance, key surgical outcomes, including time to the OR and hospital length of stay, remained stable. Signage reinforced protocol adherence, highlighting the importance of ongoing education. The low complication rate supports the overall safety of laparoscopic appendectomy. Future efforts should focus on improving compliance and optimizing preoperative workflows to enhance patient care."

    "abstract": "This study provides an up-to-date diagnosis framework for the study of emergency general surgery (EGS) patients. A final list of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes was the main outcome for the study. Codes were compared with the number codes generated by MapIT alone. Since transition to ICD-10, a Delphi process to define EGS diagnoses, as originally described for the ICD, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codeset, has not been performed. Automated mapping software (MapIT) has been utilized, with a few studies verifying the translation. Using previously defined ICD-9 EGS codes, MapIT was used to identify ICD-10 EGS codes. Review of adjacent codes in a Delphi process resulted in a finalized list of ICD-10 codes. Delphi and MapIT codes were quantified in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to compare rates to the ICD-9 era. MapIT identified 935 ICD-10 codes from 485 ICD-9 codes. Manual review identified an additional 1907 adjacent codes. In total, after the modified Delphi process, 1579 (55.6%) of manually and MapIT-identified codes were included in the final codeset. After initial mapping, 880 (55.7%) of the final codes did not automatically map through the software. MapIT codes resulted in a significantly decreased number of patient encounters in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample compared with Delphi codes in the ICD-10 era. The Delphi-created ICD-10 EGS codeset provides a more robust, accurate translation of the ICD-9 codes than MapIT software. This codeset can be used to inform EGS research to study and improve EGS patients' care."

As traditional tooth counts inadequately assess chewing capacity, we employ functional tooth units (FTUs), a validated biomechanical metric, to investigate the chewing capacity-gallstone association through multivariate epidemiological analysis. This study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017-2020. Chewing capacity was evaluated based on the number of FTU, which were defined as pairs of opposing natural and artificial teeth. Gallstone status was determined based on abdominal sonography. Logistic regression analyses, subgroup analyses and restricted cubic spline regression, were conducted to assess the association between impaired chewing capacity (ICC) and gallstones. An association between FTU and the risk of gallstones was detected (OR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.85-0.96), suggesting protective roles of more FTUs. Significant increase in the risk of gallstones in ICC was observed (OR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.27-2.57). Subgroup analyses demonstrated consistent results in all subgroups, except for individuals aged>65, male, white, education (Grades 0 - 12, High school or equivalent), drinking, Normal weight, Overweigh, and diabetes. Restricted cubic spline regression analysis demonstrated the risk of gallstones increased with FTUs decreases, particularly FTU≤6. This population-based study revealed a significant link between the ICC and a higher prevalence of gallstones, which suggests that maintaining functional teeth may be a protective factor. Prospective studies are needed to elucidate the causal mechanisms and explore potential intervention strategies."

    "abstract": "The Clavien-Dindo (CD) classification, derived in elective surgery, limits complications to deviations from the post-operative course. The interpretation of this definition has not been examined. The application of the CD definition to emergency general surgery (EGS) is limited as many EGS patients have a pre/non-operative component of care allowing under-capture of adverse events that are relevant to quality of surgical care. This study aimed to explore how surgeons interpret and define complications across elective and EGS settings. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 76 general surgeons across four Melbourne public hospitals. With reference to 43 clinical vignettes spanning pre-operative, intra-operative, post-operative, post-discharge, and non-operative care domains respondents indicated whether events constituted complications under the CD classification. The response rate was 72% and 93% of respondents reported EGS experience. Acceptance of individual events ranged from 15% (post-operative fever) to 100% (intra-operative neuropraxia). There was broad acceptance that events occurring during pre-operative and non-operative care could be classified as complications. Minor physiological changes and events not requiring intervention were often disregarded as complications. Perceived accountability influenced responses, with complications more likely to be recognized when linked directly with surgical care. Agreement on classification was only fair (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.254), indicating only fair concordance in complication classification. This study demonstrates significant variability in the classification of surgical complications within EGS, highlighting the limitations of current frameworks particularly in the acute contexts. Incorporating surgeon perspectives into refined classification systems may improve audit accuracy, better capture the complexity of EGS, and ultimately enhance patient care."

This study aimed to assess the extent of CST involvement in appendicectomies at a district general hospital in the United Kingdom and to compare the safety, efficacy, and outcomes of procedures performed across different grades of surgeons. A retrospective review was conducted of all appendicectomies performed between December 2023 and June 2024. Demographic, perioperative, and postoperative data were extracted from electronic records. Patients undergoing appendicectomy for non-appendicitis indications were excluded. Cases were categorised by the primary operator: consultant, registrar, or CST. Data were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States). Continuous and categorical variables were compared across surgeon grades using appropriate parametric or non-parametric tests. Variables with significant or clinically relevant differences were entered into multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for key confounders, with results reported as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results: A total of 254 appendicectomies were analysed: 46 (18.1%) consultant-led, 170 (66.9%) registrar-led, and 38 (15.0%) CST-led. Median patient age was 31 years (IQR 29), with no significant difference in gender or American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status distribution across groups. Consultants operated on older patients with higher pre-operative C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (p < 0.001), reflecting more complex cases. Case complexity varied significantly by operator grade (p = 0.012). Operative duration, length of stay, complication rate, and readmission rate were similar across all grades (p > 0.05). In adjusted analyses, surgeon grade was not an independent predictor of complications (CST vs consultant: adjusted OR 2.85, 95%CI 0.67-12.00, p > 0.05) or readmissions (CST vs consultant: adjusted OR 1.70, 95%CI 0.34-8.64, p > 0.05). CSTs performed significantly fewer appendicectomies than registrars yet achieved comparable outcomes when given the opportunity. No differences were found in operative duration, complication, or readmission rates between grades. These findings support increased supervised autonomy and equitable case allocation for CSTs to ensure adequate operative exposure and preparedness for higher surgical training. National evaluation of trainee involvement in index procedures is warranted to optimise training and workforce sustainability."

    "abstract": "By identifying the risk factors that contribute to complications and difficulties in postoperative extubation, this study provides insights that can refine ICU strategies, guide clinical decisions, and ultimately enhance outcomes for surgical patients on mechanical ventilation. This study aimed to evaluate the postoperative outcomes of patients requiring mechanical ventilation in general surgery. This single-centre, hospital-based, prospective observational study included elective and emergency general surgery postoperative patients aged 18 years or older who required postoperative mechanical ventilation. The collected data included demographics, American Society of Anaesthesiologists scores (ASA), quick Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment scores (qSOFA), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores (APACHE II), procalcitonin trends, and postoperative complications. The primary objective was to describe outcomes in patients requiring mechanical ventilation, with a focus on 30-day in-hospital mortality. A total of 92 patients were enrolled during the study period, with 89 admitted to the ICU following emergency surgery and three after elective surgery. Within 30 days of surgery, mortality occurred in 59 patients, while 33 survived. The incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome was significantly greater among non-survivors than among survivors. Both qSOFA ≥ 2 and ASA > 3 scores were significantly associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, and 30-day mortality. Our study underscores the importance of clinical biomarkers and scoring systems, including qSOFA, APACHE II, international normalised ratio (INR), albumin, and procalcitonin in predicting mortality and guiding management strategies for general surgery patients requiring mechanical ventilation."

This study aimed to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients admitted from the emergency department (ED) under general surgery, identify the most common presenting complaints and operative procedures, and determine which general surgery subspecialties were most frequently consulted at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC). Methods: We conducted a retrospective study at KAMC, Riyadh (MNGHA), from September 2022 to November 2023. A total of 384 ED patients admitted under general surgery were included. Data were extracted from the BestCare electronic medical record and analyzed for demographics, presenting complaints, operative procedures, and subspecialty consultations. Results: Of 384 patients, 204 (53.1%) were male and 180 (46.9%) were female. The largest age group was 30-45 years (n = 112, 29.2%), followed by <30 years (n = 98, 25.5%). Leading presenting complaints were abdominal pain (n = 243, 63.3%), fever with nausea/vomiting (n = 68, 17.7%), and rectal pain/bleeding (n = 44, 11.5%). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was the most common procedure (n = 123, 32.0%), followed by laparoscopic appendectomy (n = 57, 14.8%). ACS received most consultations (n = 231, 61.8%), with additional referrals to colorectal surgery (n = 86, 23.0%) and upper gastrointestinal surgery (n = 40, 10.7%). Nearly all consult requests originated in the ED (n = 355, 98.9%). Conclusions: Abdominal pain was the predominant ED complaint prompting surgical referral, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy and appendectomy were the most frequently performed procedures. ACS was the primary subspecialty consulted, underscoring its central role in emergency surgical care at KAMC."

Financial hardship, often referred to as \"financial toxicity,\" comprises material hardship due to unexpected bills and income loss, psychosocial stress due to uncertainty of one's financial future, and negative coping behaviors such as forgoing necessary care due to costs. These factors combine to have detrimental effects on physical and mental health and prevent optimal recovery after injury or illness. Although there is a growing appreciation that acute care surgeons should understand and evaluate financial hardship in their own populations to facilitate the optimal recovery of their patients, consensus is lacking on the best ways to measure financial hardship among the trauma and emergency surgery patient population. This current opinion will define the scope of the problem and provide pragmatic first steps to enable the evaluation of long-term, patient-level financial outcomes at your institution-including specific questions that encompass the five domains and the five mediators of financial hardship. This effort presents an updated theoretical framework, challenges common terminology, and synthesizes the most relevant tools for measuring financial hardship, presenting recommended screening questions that can be immediately used to assess long-term financial outcomes in trauma and emergency surgery populations, and standardizing data collection across institutions and facilitating larger-scale investigations."

    "abstract": "Optimal provider-to-patient (PtP) ratios in acute care surgery (ACS) remain undefined despite their importance for care quality and provider sustainability. This study aimed to understand surgeon perspectives on maximum ideal ratios across trauma, emergency general surgery (EGS) and surgical intensive care unit (SICU) services. This multicenter mixed-methods study combined quantitative surveys and semistructured interviews with ACS surgeons at level I/II trauma centers across the USA (1 August 2023-19 April 2024). Service line census data were also collected. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and qualitative analysis performed; surveys were analyzed with descriptive statistics. Fifty-two interviews were completed. Survey response rate was 50.3% (212/421 eligible division leadership and faculty) from 40 centers across 24 states. The perceived maximum safe patient load for trauma and EGS was <20 patients when working independently, and up to 40 patients with full team support. SICU ratios were lower with most reporting ≤10 patients for independent coverage and ≤20 with team support. Regarding appropriate patient loads for junior residents and advanced practice providers, most respondents recommended ≤10 patients for trauma/EGS and ≤7 for SICU. For senior residents, most recommended ≤13 patients for trauma/EGS and ≤7 for SICU. Notably, 72% of centers exceeded their own leadership-recommended maximums for at least one service line. Qualitative analysis revealed patient acuity, team experience and competing demands as key workload modulators, with concerns about care quality degradation and burnout at higher ratios. This study establishes potential upper threshold benchmarks for ACS PtP ratios with strong agreement across institutions. Division leadership should consider developing staffing models that account for patient acuity and service complexity while implementing escalation protocols for sustained high workloads. Current practices frequently exceed maximum ideal ratios, highlighting the need for evidence-based staffing guidelines that balance financial constraints with mounting evidence linking workload intensity and density to adverse outcomes.

    "title": "Concerning Trends in Acute Care Surgeries Among General Surgery Trainees.",
    "abstract": "Surveys of residents, program directors, and fellowship leaders have raised concerns about general surgery graduates' readiness for independent practice. Evolving practice patterns, particularly the rise of laparoscopic surgery, advanced endoscopy, and interventional radiology, have altered residents' exposure to traditional open procedures. However, the impact of these changes on operative experience in acute care surgery (ACS) has not been well quantified. This study assessed temporal trends in the operative experience of general surgery trainees in the acute care surgery component. We analyzed publicly available ACGME operative case logs for graduating general surgery trainees from 2000 to 2023. Procedures categorized under acute care surgery were identified. Temporal trends were assessed using the Mann-Kendall trend test and visualized with line plots. The average total case volume increased from 903 cases per trainee in 2006 to 1,062 in 2023. Despite the overall increase in case volume, exposure to multiple key ACS operations has declined to critically low levels. Notably, average case numbers per trainee for procedures such as splenectomy, duodenal perforation repair, open common bile duct exploration, choledochoenteric anastomosis, pancreatic abscess drainage, and esophageal perforation repair have fallen to fewer than 1 per trainee. The laparoscopic approach has largely supplanted the open approach across various procedures. Although the total operative volume for general surgery trainees has increased over time, exposure to essential open ACS procedures has markedly declined. This trend raises concerns about the adequacy of operative experience in foundational emergency surgeries and may contribute to ongoing perceptions of insufficient preparedness among graduates."

    "abstract": "Laparoscopic surgery (LS) is well established in the United Kingdom (UK), while robotic surgery (RS) is increasingly adopted in elective practice. However, its role in emergency general surgery (EGS) remains undefined. This study provides the first national estimates of RS use in UK EGS, evaluating trends in utilisation, outcomes, and workforce capacity. Two rounds of Freedom of Information (FOI) requests were submitted to all NHS acute trusts and boards providing EGS services across Great Britain, covering 1 January 2019-1 January 2023 and 1 January 2023-1 January 2025. Data collected included robotic system ownership, numbers and types of robotic procedures, length of stay (LOS), complication rates, and staffing. LOS data were reported as mean ± standard deviation, with differences between approaches assessed using Welch's t-tests. Response rates were 83% (113/136 trusts, 2019-2023) and 65% (91/140 trusts, 2023-2025). Robotic availability increased from 36 to 91 systems nationally (147% rise), with the number of trusts performing emergency RS doubling (13 to 26). A total of 1816 emergency robotic procedures were performed in 2023-2025, alongside 9232 elective cases. Cholecystectomy was the most frequent emergency procedure, increasing almost sixfold (200 → 1396). Complications were infrequent, with device-related issues (n = 18) and tissue injury (n = 27) most common. LOS was consistently shorter for RS compared with open surgery across all procedures (all p < 0.01), with particularly marked reductions in cholecystectomy, Hartmann's procedures, and small bowel resections. Comparisons with LS were procedure-specific: RS was shorter in cholecystectomy and hernia repair, equivalent in small bowel resection, and longer in appendectomy. Workforce capacity remained a limiting factor, with median in-hours trained staff unchanged (11 vs 10), but out-of-hours staff rising from 3 to 24 across all trusts. Robotic surgery in UK emergency general surgery is feasible, safe, and expanding, though utilisation continues to lag behind elective practice. RS offers clear LOS advantages over open surgery, with variable benefits compared to laparoscopy. Scaling adoption will require addressing cost, system heterogeneity, and the shortage of trained out-of-hours staff. National policy must prioritise training, standardised data collection, and equitable access to ensure safe integration of RS into routine emergency care."

    "title": "Ultrasound to guide critical decisions: All that you need to know.",
    "abstract": "Hypotension in the intensive care unit (ICU) demands rapid diagnosis and intervention, as delays in identifying the etiology of shock directly impact patient outcomes. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has become an indispensable tool for intensivists and acute care surgeons, enabling bedside classification of shock physiology and guiding targeted resuscitation. This review synthesizes current evidence and expert consensus regarding the application of POCUS in hypotensive ICU patients. Literature from emergency medicine, critical care, and trauma surgery was evaluated to outline standardized protocols (rapid ultrasound in shock, abdominal and cardiac evaluation with sonography in shock, sonography in hypotension and cardiac arrest algorithm), organ-specific applications (cardiac, pulmonary, abdominal, and vascular), training requirements, limitations, and future directions. Point-of-care ultrasound reliably distinguishes shock states (hypovolemic, cardiogenic, obstructive, distributive) within minutes. Studies demonstrate that structured ultrasound protocols increase diagnostic accuracy from approximately 60% with clinical examination alone to approximately 85% and alter management in up to 50% of patients. Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence integration, advanced venous congestion assessment (venous excess ultrasound score), and critical care transesophageal echocardiography are expanding the scope of bedside imaging. Despite its utility, ultrasound remains operator dependent, requiring structured training and continuous competency assessment. Bedside ultrasound has evolved into an extension of the clinician's physical examination and is now a core competency in critical care. For the hypotensive ICU patient, POCUS accelerates diagnosis, reduces diagnostic uncertainty, and enables lifesaving targeted therapy. As technology advances and training expands, ultrasound will continue to shape the standard of care for critically ill patients with shock."

This study examines differences in damage control laparotomy (DCL) utilization and mortality between daytime and nighttime emergent laparotomies.MethodsRetrospective cohort study from January, 2015 to December, 2023 of patients undergoing emergent exploratory laparotomy during either daytime (7:00 AM-5:00 PM) or nighttime (5:00 PM-7:00 AM) was performed. The primary outcome was all-cause inpatient mortality. Secondary outcomes included DCL rates, complications, critical care metrics, and hospital length of stay. Between-group differences were assessed, and multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the effect of nighttime presentation on DCL and mortality.ResultsAmong 1279 patients, 710 received daytime surgery (56%). Nighttime patients (n = 569, 44%) had higher ASA class 5 proportions (8.6% vs 4.8%, P = .0062) and greater intraoperative vasopressor use (62% vs 52%, P = .0350). Damage control laparotomy was more frequent at night (50.4% vs 38.7%). Mortality was higher for nighttime cases (18.3% vs 14.1%), independent of treatment DCL. Nighttime surgery was associated with significantly greater rates of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and vasopressor use, but durations of these therapies were not significantly different between groups. Nighttime surgery showed an odds ratio of 1.42 for receiving DCL (95% CI 1.06-1.90, P = .017), but it was not clearly associated with mortality.ConclusionsFor EGS patients, nighttime surgery is associated with higher DCL utilization and mortality compared to daytime surgery. These findings are likely due to higher patient acuity and hemodynamic instability at night."

    "abstract": "Emergency laparotomy is a high-risk surgery, and postoperative functional decline contributes to the 1-yr mortality of 25%. However, there is no established guidance around postoperative interventions to restore functional capacity, including early mobilisation. This scoping review synthesised current evidence on the definition of early mobilisation, delivery of interventions, barriers, and outcomes reported for postoperative mobilisation interventions.The review followed a structured methodological framework and was registered with Open Science Framework. Studies were identified through MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL. Eligible studies described an early mobilisation protocol (in isolation or as a bundled intervention) after emergency laparotomy. Data were extracted and analysed descriptively.Fourteen studies (2783 participants) were included, with all but one published since 2018. Mobilisation out of bed within 24 h of surgery was the most frequently used definition of early mobilisation. Adherence rates ranged from 31% to 96%. Interventions were heterogeneous, ranging from encouragement to achieve mobilisation targets through to comprehensive multidisciplinary programmes. Intervention groups tended to achieve earlier and greater mobilisation. Key modifiable barriers were pain, fatigue, and limited physiotherapy staffing. All studies reported physical performance outcomes; only one reported quality of life outcomes.This scoping review found heterogeneity in the delivery, dose, timing, and adherence to mobility interventions. Barriers to mobilisation after emergency laparotomy mirror those described after elective surgery. We suggest alignment in reporting the impact of individual factors (such as frailty and socioeconomic context) and core outcomes (including patient-centred measures) to standardise early postoperative mobilisation interventions and allow for synthesis of the evidence base.

    "abstract": "In patients with surgical emergencies, balancing time to operative intervention with goals-of-care discussions is critical. When patients lack capacity, surgeons depend on surrogate consent (SC). We aimed to understand outcomes associated with SC compared to patient consent in emergent surgery. We performed a single-center, retrospective review of patients undergoing emergent laparotomy within 6 h of consultation. Data were collected on demographics, clinical characteristics, outcomes, and details of consent. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed, adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score, comparing SC and patient consent. We included 479 patients, 26.7% with SC. Patients with SC tended to be older (median 65.2 versus 58.2 y, P < 0.001), have a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (≥5; 46.9% versus 22.5%, overall P < 0.001), have an ASA classification of IV or V (59.3% versus 24.8%, P < 0.001), and present with a nonzero quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (51.6% versus 23.4%, P < 0.001). Associated comorbidities in SC more commonly included cancer (25.0% versus 16.2%, P = 0.029) and neurodegenerative disease (8.6% versus 3.4%, P = 0.019). Patients with SC were more often discharged with mechanical ventilation (33.6% versus 5.1%, P < 0.001) and supplemental nutrition (31.3% versus 8.3%, P < 0.001). They had independently higher odds of unplanned reoperations (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-4.9), systemic complications (aOR 2.4, 95% CI 1.5-3.8), and death (aOR 5.4, 95% CI 2.7-11.0) when controlling for age, sex, race, insurance status, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and ASA classification. Patients who underwent laparotomy with SC tended to be older, more severely ill, and with more comorbidities. They were more often discharged with life-sustaining therapy and had higher odds of inpatient complications. When obtaining SC, surgeons should discuss whether these outcomes would be goal concordant."

Computed tomography (CT) aids in diagnosing SBO by identifying transition points and potential etiologies, though accuracy varies. SBO in a virgin abdomen (SBO-VA) presents unique diagnostic challenges. This study assesses CT accuracy in identifying SBO-VA etiologies in patients at a tertiary military treatment facility to help guide future management strategies.MethodsThis retrospective study reviewed SBO-VA cases from 2005-2021 with IRB approval. Patients were identified via ICD codes and included if ≥ 18 years with CT-confirmed SBO and no prior abdominal surgery. Demographics, imaging, and surgical findings were collected. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of CT in identifying intraoperative etiologies were calculated.ResultsOf 80 patients with SBO and no prior abdominal surgery, 37 underwent operative management and were included in the final analysis. CT imaging showed 100% sensitivity for confirming obstruction and localizing a transition point. Diagnostic accuracy varied by etiology: sensitivity was highest for foreign bodies (100%). Strictures had a high sensitivity as well (80%), with a PPV (1.0) and specificity (100%) for foreign body, mass, and strictures. Among 17 non-operatively managed patients, adhesive disease was the most commonly presumed cause (56%), followed by partial obstruction or ileus (25%) with malignancy suspected in 2 (12%).ConclusionCT reliably identifies SBO and transition points but has variable accuracy in determining specific etiologies, underscoring the need for clinical judgment in nonoperative vs operative management in patients with SBO-VA."

We examined the association between hospital occupancy and incidence of complications during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Military Health System. This retrospective cross-sectional study used inpatient hospital encounters data (October 2019-May 2023) from the U.S. Military Health System Data Repository. TRICARE beneficiaries admitted and treated for traumatic injury, emergency general surgery conditions, myocardial infarction, or cerebrovascular accident at a military treatment facility. We used multivariable logistic regression to determine if the incidence of complications (i.e., catheter-acquired urinary tract infections, central line acquired bloodstream infections, decubitus ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) was associated with changes in hospital occupancy rate (i.e., inpatient days per bed-day per month). Of 24,926 TRICARE beneficiaries eligible for inclusion, 58% were male, 55% White, and 84% non-Hispanic. The average hospital occupancy rate was 0.45 inpatient days per bed-day per month (SD = 0.24) for included hospitals from October 2019 to May 2023. Compared to the lowest hospital occupancy tertile, the likelihood of complications was 36% higher at hospitals in the middle tertile (OR: 1.36, 95% CI, 1.15-1.61), and 20% at hospitals in the higher tertile (OR: 1.20, 95% CI, 1.01-1.43). The incidence of inpatient complications appeared to increase with increasing hospital occupancy. Future disaster preparedness efforts should proactively address widespread workforce shortages to mitigate the effects of hospital occupancy surges."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to validate the Emergency Surgery Acuity Score (ESAS) in Korean patients who underwent emergency general surgery (EGS) and evaluate its effectiveness in predicting various outcomes. Retrospective cohort study. Two tertiary hospitals in South Korea. This study included 1629 adults who underwent EGS between July 2014 and December 2019. The ESAS and its abbreviated version, the Physiological Emergency Surgery Acuity Score (P-ESAS), were calculated for each patient. Predictive performance was assessed for 28-day mortality, post-operative complications, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and hospital length of stay (LOS). C-statistics were used to compare ESAS with P-ESAS and other scoring systems, including the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Logistic regression models were employed to identify independent predictors of 28-day mortality, incorporating clinically relevant covariates such as demographic characteristics, comorbidities, physiological parameters, and surgical factors. The ESAS and P-ESAS demonstrated superior predictive abilities compared to the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) across clinical outcomes. For 28-day mortality, the c-statistics were 0.917 for ESAS, 0.897 for P-ESAS, and 0.691 for CCI. Both ESAS and P-ESAS outperformed CCI in predicting post-operative complications (c-statistics: 0.701, 0.677, and 0.637, respectively) and ICU admission (c-statistics: 0.777, 0.737, and 0.645, respectively). Linear regression analysis revealed a significant relationship between ESAS and hospital length of stay (LOS = 2.96 × ESAS; p < 0.001, adjR2 = 0.430). Both ESAS and P-ESAS were identified as significant independent predictors of 28-day mortality in multivariable analyses. The ESAS is validated as an effective tool for predicting 28-day mortality, post-operative complications, ICU admission, and hospital LOS in Korean patients undergoing emergency general surgery. Its predictive performance compared to other scoring systems highlights its potential to improve risk stratification and resource management in emergency surgery settings."

    "abstract": "Individual surgeons have different practice patterns. The extent of variation across surgeons in the use of operative and nonoperative treatment remains unknown. This study examines differences in the use of operative treatment for emergency general surgery (EGS) conditions at the surgeon level. Patients aged ≥18 y hospitalized for EGS conditions were identified in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Database (2016-2020) in FL/MD/NV using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes. Tendency to operate (TTO = number of operations performed/number of patients treated) was calculated at the surgeon level for all EGS conditions and for complicated diverticulitis and cholecystitis. Differences in surgeon practice and patient attributes by the lowest and highest surgeon TTO quartiles were examined. Overall, 1884 surgeons treated 347,589 patients with EGS conditions. Median surgeon TTO was 59% [interquartile interval: 44%, 68%] for all EGS conditions. Median surgeon TTO was 44% [25%, 59%] for complicated diverticulitis and 74% [66%, 81%] for cholecystitis. Low-TTO surgeons treated fewer EGS patients per year than high-TTO surgeons (median 23 versus 41, P < 0.001). Of note, the total number of inpatients (EGS and non-EGS) treated per surgeon per year was similar between low- and high-TTO surgeons (103 versus 104 patients, P < 0.001). The use of operative treatment for common EGS conditions depends, in part, on the surgeon that each patient is randomly assigned. Moreover, many EGS conditions are managed nonoperatively by surgeons. Surgeons should be compensated for the totality of their expertise."

While machine learning (ML) may improve risk prediction and decision making in this setting, its development, validation, and implementation in ACS remain understudied. We therefore evaluated the techniques, predictor features, and outcomes used in ML-driven risk prediction models in ACS and generated recommendations to inform future research and support clinically meaningful implementation. A systematic review of ML-driven predictive models in ACS (emergency general surgery, surgical critical care, trauma) was conducted. Models were analyzed by predictor features, outcomes, algorithms, and performance. The best-performing models for the most commonly predicted outcome were identified. Of 52 studies, 57.7% focused on trauma populations. Most models used registry data (76.8%), fewer used electronic health records (28.8%), and only five studies performed external validation after model development. Common algorithms included logistic regression (44.2%), random forest (34.6%), and decision trees (26.9%). Mortality (59.6%), complications (30.8%), and triage/severity (15.4%) were the most frequent outcomes; patient-centered/reported outcomes were absent. Features commonly included demographics, physiologic scores, and vital signs, while imaging and intraoperative data were underused. Natural language processing was used in four studies. Model performance was typically assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (88.5%), with support vector machines demonstrating the highest performance. Machine learning models generally outperformed conventional risk scores among 11 comparative studies. Machine learning-driven predictive models in ACS show promising performance but are constrained by limited methodological rigor, real-world validation, and substantial heterogeneity in features, outcomes, and algorithms, challenging systematic adoption and oversight. A grounded understanding of ACS decision making workflows and their postimplementation impact may ensure clinically relevant, seamless, and safe integration of ML-based risk prediction.

However, its application in emergency settings remains underexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and perioperative outcomes of robotic surgery in emergency general surgical cases when performed by an experienced surgical team. This observational, single-center study included 12 patients who underwent emergency robotic surgery at a high-volume tertiary care institution. All procedures were performed by the same surgeon with extensive experience in minimally invasive and robotic techniques. Demographic data and perioperative outcomes were prospectively recorded. Given the small sample size and single-arm design, only descriptive statistics were reported. Continuous variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and median (range), and categorical variables as counts and percentages. No inferential statistical testing was applied, as the study was not powered for comparative analysis. The median patient age was 73 years (range 38-91), with a median BMI of 27 kg/m² (range 25-34). The most common indications were obstructing colon tumors (58.3%) and incarcerated hernias (16.7%). The median operative time was three hours (range, two to six hours). There were no conversions to open or laparoscopic surgery. Minor postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grade I-II) occurred in two patients (16.7%) and were managed conservatively. One intraoperative complication (ureteric injury) was identified and managed robotically without conversion. No patient required postoperative intensive care. The median time to first flatus and oral intake was two days (range, one to three days). The median hospital stay was two days (range, 1-11 days), with no 90-day readmissions or mortality. Robotic-assisted emergency general surgery may be a safe and feasible option in carefully selected patients when performed by an experienced surgical team with institutional support. While early results from this small cohort are favorable, further multicenter comparative studies are needed to validate these findings and define optimal patient selection."

This study included emergency department (ED) visits with acute appendicitis and subsequent appendectomies from the National Emergency Department Information System database (2015-2021). Travel distances to the hospital were measured, and the proportion of patients admitted to regional hospitals was visualized on a geographic map. Factors related to complicated appendicitis were analyzed using logistic regression. Among 207344 patients who visited the EDs, those from areas with low population density had higher proportions of patients aged ≥65 years (23.2%), Medical Aid recipients (4.8%), transfers from other hospitals (39.3%), and cases of complicated appendicitis (7.0%) compared to other regions. Additionally, patients in low-density regions had the highest proportion of traveling 50 km or more (27.7%), compared to those in mid-density (5.9%) and high-density (2.5%) regions. In the multivariate analysis, patients aged ≥65 years exhibited a stronger association with complicated appendicitis compared to other age groups. The current results suggested that regions with low population density experienced low access to surgical care, revealing significant regional variation linked to population density. Given the rapidly aging population and the concentration of residents in urban areas in South Korea, urgent policy action is needed to ensure the adequate delivery of emergency general surgery services in low-density regions."

Despite recommendations favoring narrow-spectrum agents, broad-spectrum antibiotic use remains high. This multi-site quality improvement initiative aimed to implement a standardized care pathway to improve antibiotic stewardship. Methods: A multi-disciplinary task force developed and implemented an evidence-based pathway across six hospitals within a large health system. Data were compared for patients treated 12 months before and after implementation. The primary outcome was empirical broad- versus narrow-spectrum antibiotic use. Secondary outcomes included duration of therapy and balancing measures such as length of stay, 30-day readmission, and cost. Results: Among 1,279 patients with acute appendicitis (619 pre- and 660 post-intervention), empirical narrow-spectrum use increased significantly (14.2%-18.5%, p = 0.04), with corresponding decreases in broad-spectrum use (82.1%-78.2%, p = 0.09). Statistical process control charts revealed special cause variation, including sustained increases in narrow-spectrum prescribing. Clinical outcomes were unchanged: no differences were observed in length of stay (1.5 d [IQR: 0.9-2.8] versus 1.6 d [IQR: 0.9-2.9]; p = 0.62), 30-day readmission (7.9% vs. 7.1%, p = 0.60), infection-related readmission (1.1% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.57), or technical direct cost ($4,700 [IQR: $3,712-$6,680] versus $4,559 [IQR: $3,470-$6,759]; p = 0.183). Conclusion: A standardized care pathway significantly improved antibiotic selection for acute appendicitis without negatively impacting outcomes or costs. This initiative illustrates the feasibility of scalable, evidence-informed interventions to promote stewardship across diverse clinical settings."

    "title": "Timely Diagnosis of Acyclovir-Induced Neurotoxicity During Acute Care Surgery Resuscitation: A Rare Complication of Common Herpes Zoster Treatment.",
    "abstract": "Acyclovir-induced neurotoxicity is a serious adverse effect of acyclovir, which is widely utilized to treat herpes zoster, and presents with diverse neuropsychiatric symptoms. However, cases where psychiatric manifestations have resulted in self-inflicted abdominal injuries are extremely rare. Moreover, obtaining detailed medical and medication histories during trauma resuscitation is often difficult. A 58-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease on maintenance dialysis was found at home in a stuporous state after stabbing his abdomen and was transported in hemorrhagic shock. Emergency laparotomy showed transverse colonic and mesenteric injuries, which were treated with hemostasis and repair. During trauma resuscitation, it was discovered that the patient had ingested three days' worth of valacyclovir, prescribed two days earlier for herpes zoster, inappropriately over a short period. The patient's acute psychiatric manifestations were attributed to acyclovir-induced neurotoxicity in the absence of a psychiatric history. Hemodiafiltration was performed because the postoperative disturbance of consciousness persisted, and this resulted in rapid improvement. The patient was extubated on postoperative day 2, the neuropsychiatric symptoms resolved, and the patient was discharged on day 10. At admission, the whole blood acyclovir concentration was 6.45 μg/mL, and the concentration of its metabolite, 9-carboxymethoxymethylguanine, was 10.5 μg/mL, both of which were substantially elevated. This case report underscores a rare presentation of Acyclovir-induced neurotoxicity in which neuropsychiatric symptoms led to self-inflicted abdominal injury and hemorrhagic shock. Even in the acute setting of trauma resuscitation, careful history-taking, including medication use, can be crucial for timely diagnosis and effective treatment. Clinicians should remain vigilant of acyclovir despite it being commonly prescribed for herpes zoster because of its potential to cause severe psychiatric manifestations, and sufficient patient education is essential to prevent its misuse."

    "title": "From Emergency Department to Operating Room: The Role of Early Prehabilitation and Perioperative Care in Emergency Laparotomy: A Scoping Review and Practical Proposal.",
    "abstract": "Emergency laparotomy (EL) carries high morbidity and mortality relative to elective abdominal surgery. While Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) principles improve outcomes in elective care, their translation to emergencies is inconsistent. The emergency department (ED) provides a window for rapid risk stratification and pre-optimization, provided that interventions do not delay definitive surgery. We conducted a PRISMA-ScR-conformant scoping review to map ED-initiated, ERAS-aligned strategies for EL. PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane were searched in February 2025. Eligible sources comprised ERAS guidelines, systematic reviews, cohort studies, consensus statements, and programmatic reports. Evidence was charted across five a priori domains: (i) ERAS standards, (ii) comparative effectiveness, (iii) ED-feasible pre-optimization, (iv) risk stratification (Emergency Surgery Score [ESS], frailty, sarcopenia), and (v) oncological emergencies. Thirty-four sources met inclusion. ERAS guidelines codify rapid assessment, multimodal intraoperative care, and early postoperative rehabilitation under a strict no-delay rule. Meta-analysis and cohort data suggest ERAS-aligned pathways reduce complications and length of stay, though heterogeneity persists. ED-feasible measures include multimodal analgesia, goal-directed fluids, early safe nutrition, respiratory preparation, and anemia/micronutrient optimization (IV iron, vitamin B12, folate, vitamin D). Sarcopenia, frailty, and ESS consistently predicted adverse outcomes, supporting targeted bundle activation. Evidence from oncological emergencies indicates feasibility under no-delay governance. A minimal, ED-initiated, ERAS-aligned bundle is feasible, guideline-concordant, and may shorten hospitalization and reduce complications in EL. We propose a practical framework that links rapid risk stratification, opportunistic pre-optimization, and explicit continuity into intra- and postoperative care; future studies should test fidelity, costs, and outcome impact in pragmatic emergency pathways."

    "title": "Improving postoperative functional outcomes through timely physiotherapy referrals in acute care surgery patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgeries: a multidisciplinary quality improvement initiative at Hazm Mebaireek General Hospital, Qatar.",
    "abstract": "Recovery in postoperative patients involves multiple domains including physical, physiological, psychological, social and economic aspects. Immediate postoperative physiotherapy (PT) is crucial for promoting early recovery and reducing hospital stay, particularly after common general surgeries like laparoscopic appendectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy and hernia repair. Despite its benefits, there is often a gap in the optimal delivery of PT services, as observed at Hazm Mebaireek General Hospital, where only 10.4% of postoperative patients were referred to PT. The project aimed to improve the Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) distance from 250 m to 350 m and the incentive spirometry inspiration volume (ISIV) from 927 mL/s to 1200 mL/s in acute care surgery (ACS) postoperative patients over a 12-week period. This was to be achieved by increasing the percentage of immediate postoperative PT referrals from 10% to 50% through multiple Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles. The project involved a multidisciplinary team of ACS surgeons, physiotherapists and inpatient nurses. The interventions included educational workshops, daily reminders and personalised reminders to on-call surgeons. Process, outcome and balancing measures were tracked to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions. The percentage of immediate postoperative referrals to PT increased from 10% to 67.7%, surpassing the target. The average 6MWT distance improved from 247.17 m to 390.86 m, and the average ISIV increased from 927 mL/s to 1198 mL/s. There were no reported increases in fall incidents or pain following PT, indicating that the interventions improved care quality without compromising patient safety. The project successfully enhanced postoperative recovery through increased PT referrals, demonstrating the effectiveness of targeted educational interventions and systematic reminders. These findings suggest that simple, targeted interventions can significantly improve postoperative care. Future steps include institutionalising the successful strategies, expanding them to other departments and exploring broader applications to ensure sustainability and scalability."

The aim of the study was to determine the impact of the pandemic on the number of emergency surgical operations performed at Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. The study was a retrospective cross-sectional study, comparing the number of emergency operations performed before the pandemic to those performed during the pandemic lockdowns at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. The data were retrieved from the Web Surgibank and Clinicom databases. The total number of operations performed during the study period (April 2019 - March 2021) was 13 715. The most frequently performed procedure types were orthopaedics (18.6%), hands (16.3%), acute care surgery (16.5%), neurosurgery (10.5%) and trauma (10.1%). There was a 19.5% reduction which was statistically significant (p = 0.002) in the number of surgeries before COVID-19 and during COVID-19. The mean number of operations during the pandemic was less compared to the pre-COVID-19 period (p < 0.001). COVID-19 significantly impacted the number of operations performed during the pandemic at Groote Schuur Hospital. This overall reduction was less compared to international centres."

    "abstract": "Ineffective patient handover leads to patient harm, yet no criterion standard exists for safe and effective practice in surgery. To determine whether the SIPS (sickest patients first; introduction, situation, background, assessment, recommendation; prioritize; summarize) surgical handover system is associated with improved patient physiology and safety. This prospective interventional cohort study included an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design and was carried out between January 2023 and June 2024 at the general surgery departments of 2 tertiary academic hospitals. Physicians participating in postcall (emergency) general surgery handover meetings were included. Data were collected for consecutive patients admitted for emergency general surgery before and after implementation of the intervention, providing they had a minimum of 6 hours of Early Warning Score data available following the time of the handover meeting. Data were analyzed from November 27, 2023, to May, 8, 2025. Staff were trained in the use of a 4-step approach to handover meetings, SIPS, which defines the minimum steps required for safe surgical handover. Handover quality, changes in vital signs, length of stay, mortality, escalations in care, staff perceptions of safety, and implementation success were evaluated through handover observations, a retrospective review of patient records, and staff surveys. Data were collected for 2261 patients, including 1469 patients before the intervention (708 [48.2%] female; mean [SD] age 54.6 [20.3] years) and 792 patients after the intervention (411 [51.9%] female; mean [SD] age 52.8 [20.6] years). A total of 182 residents took part in handovers during the study period, during which time 126 handover meetings were observed. After the intervention, handover quality improved across multiple domains without prolonging meeting duration and was associated with significant improvements in patient vital signs at 12 hours (170 patients [21.5%] vs 247 patients [16.8%]; difference, 4.6 [95% CI, 1.2 to 8.1] percentage points; P = .007) and 24 hours (212 patients [26.8%] vs 294 patients [20.0%]; difference, 6.7 [95% CI, 3.0 to 10.4] percentage points; P < .001). Staff-reported handover-related patient safety events also decreased after the intervention (13 days with events [19.7%] vs 4 days with events [4.6%]; difference, -15.1 [95% CI -4.5 to -25.6] percentage points; P = .004), with improvements in staff-perceived handover safety and quality. Successful implementation was confirmed by high rates of adoption, fidelity, and sustainability. In this cohort study, implementation of the SIPS surgical handover system was associated with improvements in handover quality, patient physiology, and staff perceptions of safety without prolonging handover meetings."

    "abstract": "While subtotal cholecystectomy (STC) is a safe bailout procedure for difficult cholecystectomies, surgeon utilization of fenestrating or reconstituting operative techniques and the subsequent outcomes achieved are unclear. As existing data is primarily limited to small, single institution studies, we leveraged data from a statewide, multi-institutional collaborative to evaluate the impact of STC technique on postoperative outcomes and procedures. We prospectively identified patients who underwent STC across 11 hospitals in an Emergency General Surgery collaborative quality initiative over 5 years. Patients were classified into fenestrating or reconstituting technique by standardized definitions. We also captured interventional radiology (IR) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures during index admission and subsequent encounters. Risk-adjusted outcomes were evaluated using multivariable regression models accounting for sociodemographic, comorbidity, and disease severity data. 369 patients underwent STC. Fenestrating technique utilization varied widely across hospitals (45-95%). Fenestrating technique was associated with an increased rate of bile leak (22.0 vs 6.9%, aOR 4.34, 95% CI 1.95-9.65, p<0.001), and reconstituting technique was associated with an increase in retained common bile duct stones (14.3 vs 4.2%, aOR 4.72, 95% CI 2.27-9.83, p<0.001). Other clinical outcomes were similar. Fenestrating technique was associated with more postoperative IR or ERCP procedures (36.3 vs 19.4%, p=0.01), and 71% of ERCPs occurred by postoperative day 2. 40% of all postoperative ERCPs were not associated with a finding of bile leak or retained common bile duct stones. Distinct clinical outcomes and postoperative procedure profiles imply that STC technique should be tailored to clinical circumstances. Patient characteristics, advanced endoscopy availability, and surgeon familiarity should guide choice of STC technique. Creation of guidance measures to optimize postoperative ERCP utilization should be undertaken."

Despite advances in imaging, many diaphragmatic injuries are not identified on initial trauma CTs, leading to delays in diagnosis and possibly life-threatening complications. While some cases present acutely with respiratory distress, others remain undetected for years, progressing to delayed traumatic diaphragmatic hernia (dTDH). In this review, we discuss TDI and present two cases of delayed hernias that presented to the hospital and required urgent surgical intervention. However, as opposed to immediate presentation or long delayed presentation, these hernias developed in the intermediate timeframe. As such, we discuss the need for a structured follow-up for those at high risk of a traumatic hernia."

    "abstract": "Robotic surgery continues to expand rapidly in elective settings; however, its role in emergency care is limited to date. This study aims to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the adoption of robotic emergency general surgery (EGS) within a high-volume centre. Robotic EGS cases performed between 2020 and 2024 at a large UK university hospital were identified and matched 1:3 to non-robotic cases based on operation type, age, gender, and pathology. Data on demographics, operative details, and operative and clinical outcomes were collected. Groups were compared using appropriate statistical tests. A total of 369 patients were included, with 95 (25.7%) in the robotic and 274 (74.3%) in the non-robotic (open/laparoscopic) EGS group. There were no differences between groups for demographics, procedures, or pathology. No statistically significant differences were observed in major complications (10.5% vs 9.1%, p = 0.688), conversion to open surgery (1.1% vs 3.9%, p = 0.174), post-operative length of stay (4 vs 3 days, p = 0.814), and 6-month mortality (0.0% vs 2.9%, p = 0.092) between robotic and non-robotic groups. Adjusted analyses showed no association between surgical approach and differences in operative time, major complications, or post-operative stay. The introduction of robotic emergency general surgery is safe and feasible with comparable short-term clinical outcomes to non-robotic approaches. Further research is needed to explore the impact of an established robotic EGS programme on long-term clinical, patient, and surgeon-reported outcomes."

    "abstract": "Ambulatory care is defined as the provision of medical treatment by healthcare professionals outside an inpatient hospital setting. While well-established in acute medicine, uptake of ambulatory pathways in emergency general surgery (EGS) is variable and optimal design and delivery is unclear in this context. This systematic review sought to (1) appraise current EGS ambulatory pathway literature and (2) ascertain the constituent components across the identified pathways, guiding the development of comprehensive templates for future EGS ambulatory pathways. Systematic review. PubMed, Embase, Medline and Cochrane Library, from 5 December 2018 to 5 December 2023 inclusive. All primary observational studies (ie, case-control, cohort studies and randomised controlled trials (RCTs)) were included. Case series and conference abstracts were excluded due to the high likelihood of incomplete data. Studies reporting paediatric or non-surgical populations, or ambulatory surgical care within a primary care setting, were also excluded. General study characteristics (year and journal of publication, country of origin, study design, disease area, number of patients receiving ambulatory management and use of control groups) were recorded. To identify the constituent components of EGS ambulatory pathways, an initial subset of five papers was reviewed, from which four categories were identified (decision-making processes, scoring/classification systems, investigations and care escalation and discharge criteria). An additional fifth component ('follow-up') was identified during data extraction. Reporting of the constituent components of ambulatory pathways was also extracted, as well as outcomes including readmission, complications and mortality. Of 43 included studies, there were 8 RCTs, 31 cohort studies and 4 studies using other methods. Reporting of all aspects of EGS ambulatory pathways was heterogeneous. 24 (56%) papers reported the specialty and grade of clinician acting as senior decision-maker. 17 different scoring/classification systems were used. 32 (74%) papers described using investigations to select ambulatory patients, including blood tests (n=12) and imaging (n=16). Eight studies (19%) specified both care escalation and discharge criteria. Information about follow-up was described in 29 papers, with location (n=29), time points (n=26), personnel (n=16) and the form of the follow-up (n=23) all reported variably. Readmission rates were recorded in 34 studies and ranged from 0% to 13%. Most studies (n=32) reported 30-day readmission, although 48 hours (n=1) and 90 days (n=1) were also used. Mortality was recorded in 24 papers, with 21 reporting a mortality rate of 0 and the remaining 3 reporting rates of <0.5%. Key components of published EGS ambulatory pathways include decision-making processes, scoring/classification systems, investigations, care escalation and discharge criteria, and follow-up. However, this information is currently inconsistently reported. Future work to identify and agree on guidelines for the 'core' components of ambulatory EGS pathways is needed, to facilitate cross-study comparisons, and crucially, provide a 'gold-standard' framework for developing future ambulatory pathways."

Therefore, they are uniquely positioned to examine racial disparities in the likelihood of receiving SOC and suffering complications. Using a US national database, we studied Black or White adults (≥18 years old) undergoing emergent, urgent, or elective inpatient CABG or appendectomy. The primary outcome was ICU admission stratified by procedure and was measured using mixed-effects models. A sensitivity analysis controlled for hospital. Black patients had higher odds of ICU admission post-CABG (OR 1.35 95% CI 1.27-1.42, P < 0.001) and post-appendectomy (OR 1.11 95% CI 1.05-1.17, P < 0.001). However, no significant racial disparities were observed in our sensitivity analysis. This shows that while racial disparities exist due to cultural, disease-related, and socioeconomic reasons, these may be driven by hospital-related variability, likely in familiarity with the patients' different needs, and not provider-level bias."

This scoping review was conducted in accordance with the Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews and Joanna Briggs and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews frameworks. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Scopus were searched on December 21, 2023. The search included patients 65 years of age and older undergoing evaluation, and medical and/or surgical management of an EGS condition. Data extracted included specific challenges, clinical tools, and clinician feedback strategies in older adult EGS. Of the 9,170 articles screened, 39 studies met inclusion criteria. Diagnostic challenges contributing to poor outcomes included atypical clinical presentation, delay in diagnosis, and the need for comprehensive risk assessment. Diagnostic tools included validated risk assessments for frailty, comorbidity burden, specific EGS conditions, and delirium; imaging; and serum markers. Evidence on performance feedback in this setting was limited, with 1 study showing that establishing an audit and feedback system in a geriatric short-term care unit led to improved compliance and quality of documentation. Although there are tools that can mitigate the diagnostic challenges unique in older adult EGS, further efforts are needed to effectively integrate tools and feedback strategies into frontline care."

However, due to the rarity and urgency of such cases, opportunities for hands-on procedural training are limited. We developed and evaluated a physical training model that simulates cardiac tamponade and allows for practice of the pericardial window procedure. The model was constructed using layered anatomical structures and simulated blood to replicate tamponade physiology. Emergency physicians and surgeons performed pericardiotomy using the model, after which a structured survey was conducted to assess its realism, educational value, and the participants' confidence in performing the procedure. Eight emergency or trauma physicians completed the procedure using the model and responded to the survey. The median participant age was 42 years, and three had no prior operative experience. The model received high ratings for both realism and educational value (median Likert score: 4). This simulation model provides a realistic, reproducible, and portable platform for training in rare, high-acuity procedures without the need for live patients. It may help bridge the gap in emergency care and support curriculum development for surgical education."

Patients were included if they were ≥18 years old and underwent emergent nontraumatic laparotomy. Or primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included the usage of DCL, complications, intensive care unit admission, postoperative ventilation, and hospital length of stay.ResultsA total of 1249 patients were included with 745 (59.6%) direct admissions and 504 (40.4%) transfers. Transferred patients had higher PESAS scores (5 vs 3, P < 0.0001) and ASA classifications (ASA 4: 31% vs 22%, P = 0.0004). They also had higher rates of DCL (52% vs 42%, P = 0.0008), ICU admissions (52% vs 40%, P < 0.0001), and increased ventilation in transfers (47% vs 37%, P = 0.0004). While overall complications were higher in transferred patients (50% vs 39%, P = 0.0002), mortality rates were not significantly different (18% vs 14%, P = 0.1479).ConclusionsTransferred EGS patients presented with greater preoperative severity and required DCL at higher rates. Transferred patients had increased complications, ICU, and ventilation needs. They also had an increase in complications however no difference in mortality. This suggests that while transferred patients are at increased preoperative acuity effective transfer systems and utilization of DCL may mitigate mortality risk in these patients."

However, their failure-to-rescue (FTR) rates-defined as mortality following a major complication-remain less studied. Given the increased burden of adverse outcomes in this population, we hypothesized that IFT patients would have higher risk-adjusted FTR rates than DA patients.MethodsWe performed a 5-year (2016-2020) retrospective analysis using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database, focusing on patients aged 18 years and older undergoing high-risk EGS procedures, including enterectomy, colectomy, peptic ulcer surgery, and laparotomy. To assess the impact of IFT, we employed multivariable logistic regression models, adjusting for demographic factors, comorbidities, and procedure type.ResultsAmong 70 028 patients (52% female, 66% white, median age 66), 15 032 (21.4%) underwent IFT. After risk adjustment, IFT patients demonstrated significantly higher odds of major complications (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.04-1.14), mortality (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.16-1.31), and FTR (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.04-1.19), suggesting that transferred patients are at a distinct disadvantage compared to DA patients.Discussion: Interfacility transfer is independently associated with worse outcomes in EGS patients, including higher FTR rates.

Emergent cases have poorer outcomes compared to elective cases, with only a minimal decrease in certain postoperative complications over time. This data highlights the importance of elective repair for PEHs and the need to proactively identify patients who will benefit from elective repair or specialist referral."

    "abstract": "Traumatic abdominal wall hernias are a rare complication of blunt abdominal trauma, with only a small percentage of cases reported in trauma centers. This report discusses a unique case of a 36-year-old female who developed a de novo incarcerated ventral hernia in the left iliac fossa, following a road traffic accident. The herniation involved a segment of small bowel entrapped in the defect, along with mesenteric tears and hemoperitoneum. The patient underwent emergency laparotomy, during which bowel viability was confirmed and primary repair of the defect was performed without bowel resection. The case emphasizes the importance of timely diagnosis and intervention in complicated trauma-related hernias to avoid further deterioration of the condition, like strangulation."

    "abstract": "Although procedure-specific guidelines have been established for postoperative opioid prescribing in the elective setting, it is unknown to what extent prescriptions in the emergency setting adhere to these standards. Variation in opioid prescribing for emergency general surgery patients may represent context-appropriate deviation or an opportunity for improved stewardship. Leveraging data from a statewide Acute Care Surgery collaborative, we identified patients undergoing 4 common procedures in the emergency setting: laparoscopic appendectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, emergency hernia repair, and open colectomy. We evaluated variation in discharge prescription size and adherence to elective opioid prescribing guidelines at the facility level using risk- and reliability-adjusted multilevel models. We also evaluated patient-level factors associated with non-guideline-concordant prescriptions. This study included 10,155 patients across 10 hospitals. There was wide variation in opioid prescribing between facilities in terms of total oral morphine equivalents (1.5-3.7-fold) and opioid-free discharge (1.1-2.3-fold) for all procedures. Although most prescriptions were concordant with elective guidelines (75%-96%), colectomy prescriptions were 5 times less likely to be guideline concordant than appendectomy prescriptions (25% vs 4%). Increasing comorbidity burden (adjusted odds ratio 2.51, 95% confidence interval 1.55-4.05, P < .001) and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification (adjusted odds ratio 1.77, 95% confidence interval 1.45-2.16, P < .001) were associated with non-guideline concordance. Opioid-prescribing patterns in the emergency general surgery setting are widely variable and sometimes inconsistent with elective guidelines. Procedure- and patient-level factors unique to the emergency setting may inform postoperative pathways that improve opioid stewardship."

    "abstract": "The SNAP-3 study reported one in five older surgical patients in the UK were living with frailty and two in three with multimorbidity. We now report characteristics and outcomes of specific subgroups of patients including individuals aged ≥85 yr, undergoing day or inpatient surgery and elective or emergency surgery, and undergoing common specialty procedures including orthopaedics, urology, colorectal surgery, and hip arthroplasty. This prospective observational cohort study recruited patients aged ≥60 yr undergoing surgery during five days in March 2022 across 214 UK hospitals. Daycase, inpatient, elective, and emergency surgery was included; minor or superficial surgery was excluded. Data on patient characteristics, frailty, and multimorbidity were collected. Outcomes were medical complications including delirium, collected prospectively, postoperative morbidity and death, and length of stay. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse demographic and outcome data for these subgroups defined a priori. Of 7821 participants recruited, 7134 were available for analysis. Frailty was most prevalent amongst those undergoing hip fracture surgery (58.2%; 280/481); aged ≥85 yr (49.3%; 365/740); or undergoing emergency (31.4%; 668/2126) or orthopaedic procedures (30.6%; 630/2056). Participants undergoing emergency procedures had a median postoperative stay of 5 (interquartile range 1-13) days versus 1 (interquartile range 0-3) days compared with participants undergoing elective procedures, with delirium occurring in 16.3% (348/2138) versus 2.7% (134/4922), respectively. Postoperative morbidity and 30-day mortality were highest in those undergoing hip fracture surgery (morbidity 85.3% [413/484], mortality 5.0% [24/484]); aged ≥85 yr (morbidity 49.1% [367/747], mortality 3.9% [29/741]) and undergoing emergency procedures (morbidity 49.5% [1058/2138], and mortality 3.0% [64/2124]). This snapshot of surgical patients in the UK highlights the high prevalence of frailty, postoperative morbidity, and mortality in key surgical subgroups, reinforcing the urgent need for comprehensive age-appropriate perioperative services tailored to these populations."

    "abstract": "Robotic surgery has been proposed as an approach to mitigate open surgery, which is associated with increased morbidity and worse outcomes when compared to minimally invasive cholecystectomies. The study objective was to determine the effect on conversion rates and outcomes following the adoption of robotic surgery for benign gallbladder disease in a high-risk population. Patients ≥ 18 years of age who underwent cholecystectomy for benign gallbladder disease from January 1, 2013 to April 18, 2025 at a Veterans Affairs hospital were retrospectively identified. Primary outcome was rate of conversion to open surgery. Secondary outcomes included post-operative complications and 30-day re-admissions and emergency department visits. Outcomes were compared between surgical approach eras and between robotic and non-robotic cohorts. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed adjusting for patient factors, surgical factors, and diagnosis. 636 patients (median [IQR], 61 [46, 70] years; 86.0% male) underwent a cholecystectomy most commonly for acute cholecystitis (33.2% of surgical indications). 34.4% of patients underwent surgery during the pre-robotic era, 39.2% during the transition era, and 26.4% during the robotic era. Conversion rates decreased over time (14.6% pre-robotic, 4.0% transition, and 0.0% robotic era; p <  0.001). No conversions occurred during robotic cholecystectomy. Odds ratios of composite post-operative complications, 30-day readmissions, and 30-day emergency department visits by era were similar. Following adoption of robotic cholecystectomy for benign gallbladder disease, conversion to open and primary open surgery were safely eradicated. Use of robotic surgery for patients at highest risk for conversion or with severe disease should be considered."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) represents a significant global healthcare burden. While minimally invasive techniques such as laparoscopy have become standard in elective and emergency settings, the adoption of robot-assisted approaches in EGS (REGS) has been more gradual. The expanding interest in REGS necessitates a comprehensive evaluation of its current role, outcomes, cost implications, and implementation strategies. A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched up to January 2025 for studies reporting on robot-assisted surgery in emergency general surgical settings. The following domains were assessed: Safety, clinical outcomes, cost, and experiential data, with quality assessment via the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Twenty studies involving over 5 million patients were included. The majority were retrospective cohort studies from Western centres, primarily the United States. Common procedures included cholecystectomy, colectomy, and hernia repair. Robotic approaches demonstrated low conversion rates, comparable or shorter lengths of stay, and similar or reduced complication and ICU admission rates versus laparoscopic or open techniques. However, operative times were generally longer, and hospital costs were consistently higher. Implementation strategies across four studies emphasized staged training, multidisciplinary involvement, and institutional support. Study quality ranged from moderate to good, though outcome reporting and cost analyses were inconsistent. Robot-assisted EGS appears feasible and safe in selected patients within institutions equipped with appropriate expertise and infrastructure. While early outcomes are encouraging, widespread adoption is challenged by higher costs and limited high-quality evidence. Future prospective studies, robust cost-effectiveness analyses, and structured implementation models are essential to define the long-term role of robotics in emergency surgical care."

    "title": "Value of Early Kinetics of Procalcitonin with Point-of-Care Test to Predict Postoperative Abscess Following Non-Complicated Acute Appendicitis: A Pilot Study.",
    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency, and while appendectomy typically results in good outcomes, post-operative complications, like intra-abdominal abscesses, can occur. Traditional biomarkers, such as white blood cells count and C-reactive protein, often lack the accuracy needed for early detection. Procalcitonin is emerging as a potential marker for predicting post-operative infections. This pilot study evaluates the role of kinetics of procalcitonin, measured via point-of-care testing, in predicting abscess formation in patients with non-complicated appendicitis. Materials and Methods: The study involved 33 patients undergoing appendectomy for non-complicated acute appendicitis. The levels of procalcitonin were measured at four time points: pre-operatively (T0), post-operatively (T1), on the first post-operative day (T2), and at discharge (T3). The primary outcome was the development of post-operative abscesses, confirmed by imaging or intervention. Results: Four patients (12%) developed abscesses. The levels of procalcitonin were significantly higher in the abscess group at all time points compared to the non-abscess group (p < 0.05). The levels of procalcitonin in the abscess group plateaued after an initial post-operative decline, while levels steadily decreased in the non-abscess group. Conclusions: Procalcitonin, particularly its kinetic profile, may serve as a valuable early marker for predicting post-operative abscess formation. Point-of-care testing for procalcitonin can enable timely intervention, improving outcomes. Kinetics of procalcitonin show promise as a predictor for post-operative abscesses after appendectomy, though larger studies are needed to confirm these findings."

    "abstract": "Introduction Informed consent is a crucial component of surgical practice, ensuring that patients understand the risks and benefits associated with procedures. However, handwritten consent forms are often incomplete, illegible, and inconsistent. This quality improvement project aimed to review the informed consent process for emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy and appendicectomy at a district general hospital in the United Kingdom and subsequently introduce pre-filled, procedure-specific consent forms for these procedures.  Methods  A retrospective review of 20 handwritten consent forms compared the documented risks to a standardized set (SS) of risks developed from multiple resources. This demonstrated the inadequate documentation of the risks of handwritten consent forms. In response to this, two pre-filled consent forms were developed, which incorporated the SS of risks. Layman's explanations were included, and space for additional risks was provided to cater to patient-specific needs. These new forms aimed to enhance patient-surgeon communication, facilitate patient understanding, and improve documentation. Post-intervention, a second retrospective analysis of 74 consent forms was then performed.  Results Pre-intervention, a mean of 64.00% (n = 10) of risks was mentioned for appendicectomy and 55.79% (n = 10) for cholecystectomy. The most commonly documented risks were bleeding, bruising, and infection, while less frequent risks such as infertility were often omitted. Post-intervention, the mean documentation of risks increased to a mean of 81.82% (n = 45) for appendicectomy and 79.69% (n = 29) for cholecystectomy. Conclusion This quality improvement project demonstrates that pre-filled, procedure-specific consent forms are a valuable tool in improving the consenting process, acting as aids for structured discussion of risks, improving risk documentation, and reducing human errors in documentation. As such, a set of recommendations was developed for the future development of consent forms. Additionally, these consent forms may aid the transition to digital-based systems, helping reduce paper waste. Future recommendations also include the implementation of teaching sessions on informed consent to improve the consent process."

    "abstract": "Trauma and emergency general surgery patients are at an elevated risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, deviations from guideline-recommended thromboprophylaxis regimens persist. As such, improving thromboprophylaxis compliance has been deemed a high priority. However, the few trials evaluating VTE prevention regimens in these settings have important methodological limitations preventing clinical application. Thus, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate the sample size methodology and justification in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining VTE prevention in the trauma and emergency general surgery setting. We searched two databases (Medline and EMBASE) from inception to February 17, 2025, for all English-language RCTs that enrolled adult trauma or emergency general surgery patients and evaluated an intervention aimed at preventing VTE. Citation screening, data extraction, and risk of bias were performed independently and in duplicate. We included seven studies involving 1358 patients. Most trials were single center (71.4%), assessing trauma patients (85.7%), with a primary outcome encompassing any VTE (71.4%). Only two of the six studies (33.3%) reporting sample size targets achieved their recruitment goals. None of the included studies met their prespecified VTE incidence or absolute risk reduction estimations. Furthermore, only one (14.3%) study incorporated prognostic enrichment in their methodological approach. The majority of studies (57.1%) were terminated early, citing futility of the intervention as the most common reason. This systematic review shows that RCTs assessing VTE prevention in the trauma and emergency general surgery population consistently demonstrate methodological limitations resulting in unrealistic treatment effect targets and inaccurate estimates of baseline risk. Future trials in this field should consider abandoning dichotomization with statistical analysis interpretation, as well as incorporating heterogeneity of treatment effect and prognostic enrichment in the study design."

This study describes in-hospital surgical encounters and procedures for people experiencing homelessness with Canadian data. This retrospective chart review covers a 1-y period (January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019) at two tertiary care hospitals in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Patients experiencing homelessness were identified by a listed postal code of a shelter or transitional housing location, or with no fixed address. Patients who received a surgical consultation during an emergency department visit or an in-patient admission to hospital were included. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize patient demographics, consultations, and operations. Ninety unhoused patients received care within 129 encounters; 41 were visits to the emergency department and 88 were admissions to hospital. There were 18 trauma activations. Orthopedic surgery, general surgery, and plastic surgery had the highest numbers of consults and procedures. In total, 85 procedures were completed. The average length of stay per admission was 16.1 d (standard deviation = 32.9 d). Of 129 encounters, 21.7% were associated with a complication and 17.1% with unplanned readmission. Rates of substance use and self-directed discharge from hospital were high in this population. Compared to other settings, this population experienced similar length of stay, complication, and readmission rates, but had significantly higher rates of substance use and self-directed discharge. Providing better symptom management and addiction support and reducing discrimination and restrictive policies may improve patients' experience in hospital and reduce self-directed discharges."

The primary outcome was the percentage of preventable readmissions, defined as those with actionable outpatient interventions. 1,655 patients were admitted to the EGS service, with 224 (14.1 ​%) readmitted within 30 days. The leading reason for readmission was the need for additional management of the initial diagnosis (38.4 ​%). Of the readmitted patients, only 11 (4.9 ​%) were identified as preventable due to issues such as inadequate pain control or education. Readmission patterns showed that most patients returned due to the progression of the initial diagnosis or complications, suggesting that many readmissions may be unavoidable."

This study aimed to determine whether a five-category classification for OSEs can effectively guide clinical decision-making based on patient outcomes. This retrospective cohort study used prospectively collected data from 1 May 2015 to 31 December 2023 at Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University. Among in-patients undergoing emergency general surgery, 2908 patients with OSEs were included. The OSEs were classified into five categories based on the tumor course: (1) emergency as the initial symptom, (2) emergency due to tumor progression or recurrence, (3) complications from non-invasive treatments, (4) complications from invasive treatments, and (5) emergencies unrelated to tumors but with a history of malignancy. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Obstruction was the most common emergency (58.0%), and gastrointestinal tumors were the primary source (79.8%). Category 1 emergencies were the most frequent (42.8%), followed by categories 2 (16.4%), 4 (16.0%), 5 (19.5%), and 3 (5.5%). The patients with OSEs had a higher in-hospital mortality rate than those with other types of emergencies (4.0% vs. 1.5%; p < 0.001). Perforation, age ≥ 65 years, and male sex were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality. The comprehensive five-category classification system for OSEs provided a valuable framework that may enhance clinical decision-making and guide management strategies for this patient population. Thus, it has potential to be integrated into clinical practice."

The purpose of this review is to discuss the origin of ACS and its evolution over the last 20 years and to survey the subspecialty's current status and future directions. Since the first programs were certified in 2008, the fellowship curriculum has undergone many changes. There is now more emphasis on emergency general surgery and a movement toward competency-based evaluations. Additionally, pediatrics and burn subtracks have been developed, and other programs emphasizing robotic surgery are being created. The didactic curriculum has been updated, and new programs highlighting community and networking, such as the Meet the Mentors discussions, fellow journal club, and boot camp, have also been formed. Acute care surgery has effectively leveraged the knowledge base of trauma surgery and surgical critical care to meet the changing needs of the healthcare system. Acute care surgery surgeons are well positioned for leadership roles both locally and nationally. Future challenges include building a more robust research base and further highlighting the scope and brand of ACS. ACS as a subspecialty has matured over the last two decades.

This study included patients who underwent emergency colorectal resections at Our Department between January 2020 and December 2024. Exclusion criteria were age <18 years and palliative surgery. Patients were stratified into two cohorts: octogenarians (≥80 years, Group 1) and patients aged <80 years (Group 2). Baseline characteristics, perioperative variables, and short-term outcomes were compared and analyzed. A systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD420251050770) was conducted to identify the studies evaluating outcomes of emergency colorectal resections in octogenarians. MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, and EBSCOhost were searched from database inception to April 2025. Group 1 and Group 2 included 82 and 130 patients with median ages of 84 and 67 years, respectively. The in-hospital mortality rate was 24% in octogenarians and 8% in younger patients (p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression identified hyperlactatemia as an independent negative prognostic factor for in-hospital mortality in octogenarians (p = 0.01). Through a systematic review of the literature we identified 12 publications, and the mortality rate ranged between 7.0 and 37.8%. Early identification of prognostic factors can improve clinical outcome in emergency scenarios.

In high-income countries (HICs), this is known as the July effect-the time for new inductees. We aim to study the January effect (time of new inductees in our setting) and patient outcomes in an Emergency General Surgery (EGS) cohort. We used secondary data from adult patients with EGS diagnosis from a tertiary care center in Pakistan (2010-2019). The outcomes of interest were severe adverse events (SAEs), inpatient mortality, length of stay [LOS], and failure to rescue (FTR). Multiple logistic and linear regressions was performed to assess their association. Of the 32,280 patients analyzed, 7.94% were admitted in January. There was significantly higher elective admission (61.06% vs. 53.51%) and surgical interventions (74.80% vs. 72.92%) in January compared to other months. Inpatient mortality, SAEs, FTRs, and LOS did not significantly differ between the two groups. Multivariable analysis showed no significant association of January admission with SAE (AOR 1.06; 95% CI 0.97-1.16), inpatient mortality (AOR 1.09; 95% CI 0.83-1.43), FTR (AOR 1.04; 95% CI 0.78-1.38), and LOS (β 0.12; 95% CI -0.05-0.29). The results of the study, which has no evidence of the January effect for EGS patients, suggest that this effect is not universally applicable, necessitating context-specific evaluation to understand the temporal trends in the overall health outcomes of the admitted patients."

Compared to EGS patients admitted at the operating institution (nontransfer patients), EGS transfer patients represent a higher-risk population. This study sought to evaluate the association between transfer status and postoperative complications in EGS patients. Using the 2010-2022 American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database, we identified patients aged ≥18 years who underwent an EGS operation. Logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between transfer status and postoperative outcomes while accounting for preoperative risk factors. We identified 78,513 transferred EGS patients and 560,273 nontransferred EGS patients over 13 years. The median length of hospital stay was twice as long for transfer patients compared to nontransfer patients (4 days versus 2 days). Transfer patients also had higher odds of cardiac (odds ratio 1.08, 95% confidence interval [1.03, 1.14]), pulmonary (1.22, [1.19, 1.26]), infectious (1.06, [1.04, 1.08]), renal (1.09, [1.02, 1.16]), and hematological complications (1.28, [1.25, 1.32]) compared to nontransfer patients. Furthermore, transfer patients had higher odds of unplanned return to the operating room (1.15, [1.11, 1.19]) and mortality within 30 days (1.20, [1.15, 1.24]). Transferred EGS patients demonstrated higher odds of organ-specific postoperative complications, morbidity, and mortality. Understanding the heightened risk among this patient cohort should encourage the development of transfer and treatment algorithms to anticipate and manage known complications within this high-risk population."

Age-associated physiologic decline, multimorbidity, frailty, and reduced cognitive and functional reserve contribute to the increased susceptibility to surgical and nonsurgical complications, prolonged surgical intensive care unit length of stay, cognitive and functional decline, and mortality of the critically ill older adult. Despite the high acuity and complexity of this population, geriatric-specific guidelines for surgical intensive care management remain limited. This review provides a comprehensive, evidence-informed framework for the critical care management of older adults undergoing emergency surgery, emphasizing the clinical implications of aging physiology on organ failure within current surgical intensive care practice.

Much has been written about the surgical technique, indications, management, temporizing abdominal closure, and final primary fascial closure. As with all surgical procedures, the open abdomen has associated morbidity and mortality. Complications with the open abdomen will present at different times based on the time from the index operation. We review the most common complications associated with the open abdomen, categorized by the time elapsed since the abdomen was initially opened. These range from fluid loss and electrolyte loss to the need for mechanical ventilation and nutrition support in the early course. During the midcourse, one can see the loss of domain, intra-abdominal infections, and other hospital-acquired infections. The exposed viscera are at risk of injury and anastomotic leaks, resulting in enteroatmospheric fistulas. The late course is commonly characterized by the struggle to achieve primary fascial or skin closure to protect the viscera or to decide on a planned ventral hernia. This surgical bailout technique has specific aspects that must be followed to achieve clinical success."

For this prospective study, a multimodal assessment framework incorporating WPBA tools, namely, Mini-Clinical Evaluation Exercise (Mini-CEX), Directly Observed Practical Skills (DOPS), Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP), an assessment recording, and Multisource Feedback (MSF); and competency evaluation metrics were employed. Comparative analysis of core competency scores and exit assessment performance was conducted between experimental and control groups. Data were analyzed using the chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. The First Affiliated Hospital of Naval Medical University, located in Shanghai, China. Sixty three residents undergoing standardized EGS training from January to March, 2024, at the First Affiliated Hospital of Naval Medical University, were recruited. These trainees were allocated into either experimental or control groups, using monthly randomization principles. Baseline characteristics showed no statistically significant intergroup differences in gender, training grade, educational background, standardized training source, or standardized training base (p > 0.05). The experimental group demonstrated significant post-training improvements across all competency domains (p < 0.05), whereas the control group exhibited marginal improvement (p > 0.05). While theoretical knowledge and medical documentation scores were marginally higher in the experimental group (p > 0.05), clinical skills assessment scores showed statistically significant superiority (p < 0.05). WPBA implementation effectively enhances clinical core competencies in EGS residents, and optimizes standardized training outcomes, suggesting its value as a pedagogical innovation in surgical education.1."

    "abstract": "Canada's growing immigrant population faces language and cultural barriers that hinder timely access to healthcare. The balance between elective and emergency general surgery (EGS) reflects immigrant's access to healthcare since many EGS cases are avoidable through treatment as elective procedures. This study examines whether immigrants are more likely to undergo EGS than non-immigrants and measures whether language proficiency or access to primary care plays a role in disparity in access to care. All general surgery procedures performed in British Columbia, Canada between 2013 and 2021 were identified using a population-based longitudinal administrative data that linked immigration data with physician billing and hospital data. The primary outcome was whether patients' surgery was elective or EGS and the primary exposure was immigrant status. The odds of EGS between immigrants and non-immigrants was estimated adjusting for patient and system-level differences. The analysis compared immigrants with and without English proficiency on arrival to Canada. Of 237,054 general surgery procedures, 30.7 % were EGS and 15.2 % involved immigrants. Immigrants had slightly higher odds of undergoing emergency general surgery (EGS) than non-immigrants. Immigrants not fluent in English had 16 % higher odds of EGS (OR: 1.16, 95 %CI 1.03-1.32). Immigrants with fewer GP contacts were more likely to undergo EGS (45.5 % versus 42.2 %, p < 0.01). Immigrants with language barriers and who accessed primary care less often were more likely to require EGS. These findings highlight the need for system-level interventions to reduce immigrants' reliance on emergency surgical care."

    "abstract": "Acute care surgery includes urgent non-trauma general surgical emergency, in which minimally invasive approaches, notably laparoscopic, are associated with reduced postoperative morbidity and hospital stay. Although robotic surgery has demonstrated advantages in elective procedures, its safety, feasibility, and applicability across a broad spectrum of acute care conditions remain undefined. We conducted a systematic review in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, searching PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from inception to December 2024 for studies analyzing the safety profile of robotic approaches in adult care surgery. Primary outcomes included length of stay, postoperative complications, conversion to open surgery, operative time, 30-day readmission, and mortality. Our search yielded 3,740 results. After proper analysis, a total of eighteen studies were included (2016-2024; n = 4,439,317), in which robotic approaches showed shorter length of stay (0.7-28.46 vs. 1-38.26 days), lower complication rates (2-25.62% vs. 3.7-46%), and fewer conversions (0-11.5% vs. 0-28.7%) compared to laparoscopy, though operative times were longer (67-323 vs. 46-294.5 min). Procedure-specific trends emerged, particularly to robotic cholecystectomy, concerning fewer complications (0.5-25.62% vs. 8.23-21%) and conversions (0-1.9% vs. 1.9-8.57%). In this review, robotic surgery appears as a safe and feasible alternative in acute care settings, offering potential advantages in hospital stay, postoperative complications, and conversion rates-especially for cholecystectomy and colectomy-despite longer operative durations. Further randomized trials and cost-effectiveness analyses are warranted to define its optimal role. Level III, Systematic Review Study.

    "abstract": "Perforated gastric ulcers represent life-threatening surgical emergencies with particularly high morbidity and mortality in elderly patients. While omental patch repair remains the standard treatment for duodenal perforations, optimal management of complex gastric perforations, especially those with necrosis or concurrent lesions, remains controversial. We present the case of a 72-year-old Iranian woman with multiple comorbidities who presented with septic shock secondary to gastric perforation. Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed a 1.5-cm perforation with surrounding necrosis and an adjacent gastric polyp. The patient successfully underwent combined laparoscopic wedge resection and omental patch repair, demonstrating the feasibility of this minimally invasive approach in high-risk patients. The procedure included complete excision of necrotic tissue and polyp with stapled wedge resection, followed by reinforcement using a vascularized omental patch. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, with the patient discharged on day 10. Histopathology confirmed benign ulceration without malignancy. At the 3-month follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic with no recurrence. This case highlights that laparoscopic wedge resection with omental patch repair offers both diagnostic and therapeutic advantages for complex gastric perforations, particularly when tissue viability is questionable or concurrent lesions are present. The technique combines the benefits of minimally invasive surgery, reduced morbidity, and faster recovery with the reliability of traditional omental patching. The successful outcome highlights the expanding role of laparoscopy in emergency general surgery for high-risk populations."

    "abstract": "Structural inequities are pervasive in the US emergency care system and disproportionately affect socially vulnerable neighborhoods. Spatial patterns of hospital access for patients requiring emergency surgical care are influenced by health system structure; however, neighborhood-level variation and its association with clinical outcomes has not yet been characterized. Examine variation in spatial patterns of hospital access for adults with nontraumatic surgical emergencies and its association with clinical outcomes. Retrospective analysis of California State Inpatient Discharge Data (2014-2015) of adults admitted with 1 of 8 emergency general surgery (EGS) conditions. We visualized patient home-to-hospital flows, then assessed Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) patterns of spatial access using the Dispersion Index (DI), measured by the coefficient of variation of patient travel times where higher values indicate greater dispersion. Mixed-effect regression analysis was used to examine the association of DI with in-hospital mortality, nonhome discharge, and length of stay, adjusting for relevant patient, hospital, and neighborhood characteristics. Among 337,695 EGS admissions, increasing DI was associated with greater neighborhood social deprivation index (SDI). After adjusting for relevant covariates, greater dispersion was associated with an increase in in-hospital mortality in the highest decile of dispersion (aOR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.03-1.26). The magnitude of effect was greater for patients from high-SDI neighborhoods: mortality (aOR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.11-1.44). High dispersion was associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes among EGS patients, with a greater effect for underserved groups. High variation in patterns of hospital access for emergency care likely reflects structural barriers to care and may be one mechanism contributing to the relationship between neighborhood social vulnerability and surgical outcomes."

This study aimed to assess the impact of resident involvement on postoperative outcomes in older adult patients undergoing EGS. Propensity-score matched cohort study. The 2007-2012 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database. Patients aged ≥65 years who underwent one of eight EGS procedures were included. Patients were stratified based on resident participation (RES vs. NO-RES). After propensity-score matching, each group included 2,796 patients with comparable baseline characteristics. Among 24,452 patients identified, 14,381 (58.8%) underwent procedures with resident involvement. Patients in the RES group were more likely to be Black (11.3% vs. 6.1%) and have pre-existing comorbidities, such as ventilator dependence (7.7% vs. 4.0%), and were less likely to be admitted from home (84.3% vs. 88.4%) (all p<0.001). After matching, 30-day mortality was not different between the two groups. However, patients in the RES group demonstrated higher 30-day morbidity (38.8% vs. 36.0%, p = 0.031), likely driven by a greater incidence of superficial surgical site infection (5.6% vs. 3.9%, p = 0.003) and unplanned reoperation (11.0% vs. 7.4%, p<0.001). Operative time was significantly longer in the RES group (p<0.001). Participation of residents in EGS procedures is associated with increased operative time, rate of surgical site infection, and unplanned reoperation. However, resident involvement had no effect on patient mortality. Efforts to improve surgical education while not compromising patient safety are needed."

    "abstract": "Introduction: People living with HIV (PLWHIV) have historically faced discrimination and unequal access to healthcare in the United States. This study aims to investigate differences in surgical intervention for common surgical emergencies among this population, specifically cholecystitis and appendicitis. Methods: This study utilized the TriNetX® database to compare the rate of cholecystectomies and appendectomies among PLWHIV with diagnosed cholecystitis or appendicitis, respectively, compared with HIV-negative patients. Inclusion criteria were an indication for surgical intervention, cholecystitis (K81) or appendicitis (K35-37). Cohorts were defined by HIV status, and analysis was stratified by procedure. Cohorts were propensity matched for age, race, leukocyte count, HIV 1 RNA volume, and substance abuse disorders. Outcomes were defined as patients receiving cholecystectomy or appendectomy in two separate analyses. Relative difference (RD) and relative risk (RR) were compared with between HIV+ and HIV- cohorts. Results: The cholecystectomy analysis had 609,127 total patients, with 3,597 per cohort after matching. The appendectomy analysis had 641,395 total patients, with 2,368 per cohort after matching. HIV-positive patients with cholecystitis had a 16.736% risk of undergoing cholecystectomy compared with 23.019% risk in HIV-cholecystitis patients (RD: -6.283% [95% confidence interval (95% CI): -8.122%, -4.444%], p < 0.0001, RR 0.727 [95% CI: 0.662, 0.799]). HIV-positive patients with appendicitis had a 14.147% risk of undergoing appendectomy compared with 17.272% in HIV-appendicitis patients (RD: -3.125%% [95% CI: -5.196%, -1.054%], p < 0.0031, RR 0.819, [95% CI 0.717, 0.935]). Conclusions: This study demonstrates a significant disparity in timely surgical intervention for PLWHIV. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the etiology of demonstrated incongruencies and their clinical relevance."

With the differentiation and development of general surgery sub specialties, department of emergency surgery has begun to emerge, but its development faces various challenges, such as insufficient medical staff, inadequate treatment capabilities, and poor treatment outcomes. To change this situation, about 20 years ago, a new treatment model began to emerge in the United States, establishing a department of acute care surgery that integrates trauma, emergency general surgery, and surgical critical care. This model quickly spread worldwide and achieved remarkable achievements. In recent years, colleagues in the field of surgery in China have gradually recognized the advantages of this model and established acute care surgery. This article aims to elaborate on its development process, current situation, and future trends, providing reference for the prosperous development of acute care surgery in China. 急诊手术一直是普通外科的重要组成部分，主要病种包括急腹症和创伤。随着普通外科亚专业的分化发展，急诊外科开始出现，但是其发展面临种种难题，比如医护人手不足、救治能力不够、治疗效果欠佳等。为了改变这种局面，约20年前美国开始出现新的救治模式，成立融创伤、普通外科急诊手术和外科重症为一体的急重症外科，该模式迅速在全世界范围内得到推广，并取得了令人瞩目的成就。我国外科同道近年来也逐渐认识到该模式的优势，并陆续成立了急重症外科，本文旨在阐述其发展过程、现状及未来趋势，为急重症外科在国内的发展提供参考。."

Present study aims to identify and evaluate the differences in AO technique use related to patients' conditions. This was a comparative study using a multicenter registry of postinjury AO (October 2013-February 2022). AO via REBOA was compared with RT performed in the emergency department of facilities experienced in both procedures and documented in Aortic Occlusion for Resuscitation in Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (AORTA) registry. Participants were adult trauma patients 16 years or older who experienced AO via REBOA zone 1 vs RT. The primary outcome was to identify the differences between patients treated with RT or REBOA. Ethical committee study approval number (Maryland IRB #HCR-HP-00,055,545-11). 1937 patients were included. Median age: 34 (25-49), 1599 (82.5 %) were men. Penetrating trauma: 52.4 %. REBOA was adopted in 501 (25.9 %) patients, RT in 1436 (74.1 %). Patients treated with REBOA were older (40vs32 years, p < 0.001), suffered more frequently blunt trauma (76.3 %vs37.7 %, p < 0.001) and had higher ISS (33vs26, p = 0.003). Fewer of them underwent prehospital cardio-pulmonary-resuscitation (23.2 %vs49.8 % p < 0.001); had higher median SBP and HR (83vs0, p < 0.001 and 106vs0, p < 0.001 respectively), serum lactate levels were lower (7.5vs10.3 p < 0.001). SBP≥ 60 mmHg pre-hospital and at-admission (OR 2.27) and GCS>8 at admission (OR 2.24), trauma cases admitted/year (>4000/year, OR 4.41), transfer from another trauma center (OR 1.94) were related to the use of REBOA. Higher Injury severity score (ISS >55, OR 0.66), lower number of trauma treated (<4000/year, OR 0.66) and penetrating trauma (OR 0.24) were related to the use of RT. REBOA was more frequently used for older patients with blunt trauma, higher prehospital systolic blood pressure, and Glasgow Coma Scale scores above 8. RT was more commonly performed in penetrating trauma, lower injury severity scores, and facilities with fewer annual trauma admissions. These findings suggest that patient characteristics and institutional factors significantly differed between patients treated with REBOA or RT, underscoring the need for further research."

    "abstract": "Emergency General Surgery (EGS) procedures are vital and high-risk interventions. Delivery of these procedures in military treatment facilities (MTFs) is important to beneficiaries of the U.S. Military Health System (MHS). Organizational changes, including consolidation of MTFs under the Defense Health Agency and personnel reductions, in conjunction with the COVID-19 pandemic, have led to concerns about potential declines in care quality. We assessed whether clinical outcomes remained consistent or were negatively influenced by the healthcare administrative changes and the COVID-19 pandemic. Claims data from the MHS Data Repository and ICD-10 diagnosis codes were used to identify patients, 18-64, admitted to U.S.-based MTFs between fiscal years 2016 and 2023 with an EGS condition. The main predictor was hospital EGS volume categorized into volume-based quartiles. Outcomes were 30-day mortality, complications, and readmissions. Patients were stratified into 2 time periods (FY 2016-2019 and FY 2020-2023) based on index admission date. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between MTF volume and clinical outcomes. 113,626 EGS encounters treated across 40 MTFs were identified. Adjusted analyses showed that compared to the highest volume MTFs of 2016-2019, MTFs in the lower middle quartiles (LMQ) and upper middle quartiles (UMQ) of 2016-2019 (OR: 0.67; OR: 0.67) and LMQ of 2020-2023 (OR: 0.70) had a significantly decreased likelihood of 30-day mortality. Compared to 2016-2019's highest volume MTFs, the lowest volume MTFs of 2016-2019 were significantly less likely to experience complications (OR: 0.67), while MTFs from the UMQ of 2016-2019 (OR: 1.10) and all quartiles of 2020-2023 (OR: 1.22; OR: 1.61; OR: 1.43; OR: 1.27) were significantly more likely to develop complications. Patients treated at MTFs in the LMQ and UMQ of 2016-2019 (OR: 0.78; OR: 0.70) and those in the lowest and middle quartiles of 2020-2023 (OR: 0.67; OR: 0.71; OR: 0.76) had a significantly lower likelihoods of readmission compared to the highest volume MTFs of 2016-2019. The likelihood of 30-day complications among all MTF quartiles in 2020-2023 was significantly higher compared to MTFs in 2016-2019. However, EGS patients treated in low-volume MTFs experienced similar, if not improved, clinical outcomes of mortality and readmissions compared to those treated in high-volume MTFs."

Current reviews of EGS focus on procedural-based or diagnosis-driven reviews of administrative data. However, patients evaluated by an EGS service may or may not undergo surgery. Therefore, we sought to determine the feasibility of maintaining an EGS registry to include those who do and do not undergo surgery and determine the contribution of nonoperative care to the service. Demographic and clinical data for operative and nonoperative general surgery consult patients extracted from the local medical record were entered into a registry over 12 months from 2018 to 2019. We used descriptive statistics to demonstrate differences in demographics and clinical presentation between operative and nonoperative groups. 1065 EGS patients were captured into the registry, only 40 % of whom required an operation. Insurance status and race/ethnicity were different between operative and nonoperative groups. Reasons for consultation varied broadly with the largest group (20 %) being for hepatopancreaticobiliary disease. Providing insight into the important contribution of nonoperative care on EGS burden, we present data from an institutional EGS registry. EGS registries can provide direction for future studies to guide optimal management of EGS patients, especially in resource-limited settings. Maintaining registries poses challenges but given its importance and the need to determine the contribution of patients who do not undergo procedures to the service load, resources are necessary to ensure they continue."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) has disproportionate morbidity and mortality relative to elective surgery. With earlier intervention, many emergent conditions could be treated electively. Social determinants of health (SDoH) negatively impact access to healthcare, leading to increased utilization of EGS. The goal of this study is to determine why patients with potentially elective disease receive EGS. Adults undergoing EGS with elective alternatives were identified during 2018-2019 at a single academic center. Patient demographics, clinical course, and circumstances of surgical timing were abstracted from the medical record. We compared factors influencing referral or evaluation by surgeon with chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests where appropriate. Concurrent, multi-methods were used to determine why patients fail to receive elective surgery. We identified 995 patients undergoing EGS with an elective alternative. Although 70% had insurance and a primary care physician, only 104 were evaluated by primary care, with 59 referred to and 46 evaluated by general surgery, and 22 ultimately scheduled for elective surgery. Reasons for failure of elective management included comorbidity optimization (42%), difficulties scheduling (28%), SDoH (22%), missed diagnosis (14%), and patient preference (11%). Patients cited difficulties with money, childcare, transportation, and employment within SDoH category. No significant differences in patient demographics were found for patients with and without preoperative outpatient care. At our institution, most patients are never seen by a physician prior to their admission for EGS. Even with primary care evaluation, individuals still have only a 20% chance of being scheduled for elective surgery. Future efforts must focus on increasing preventive care access within the community and streamlining the process from diagnosis to elective general surgery."

We aimed to provide evidence-based guidelines for managing inguinal hernias requiring urgent surgical intervention. An evidence-based systematic review was performed. Clinically relevant questions regarding defined Population(s), Intervention(s), Comparison(s), and Outcome(s) were selected. These questions centered around the timing of intervention, the use of mesh, the surgical approach, and the use of antibiotics in patients who presented with incarcerated or strangulated inguinal hernias requiring urgent surgical interventions. A comprehensive literature search was completed from 1946 through March 11, 2024. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology was used in the creation of the recommendations. Consensus was achieved for all final recommendations. Of 7,038 articles reviewed, 34 met the inclusion criteria. Early intervention (<6 hours from symptom onset) was associated with a lower incidence of bowel resection (odds ratio [OR], 0.1 [0.05, 0.29]; p < 0.0001). Hernia repair with mesh was associated with decreased incidence of recurrence (OR, 0.34 [0.13, 0.87]; p = 0.02) and mixed results for surgical site infections. Laparoscopic repairs decreased recurrence rates (OR, 0.75 [0.58, 0.99]; p = 0.03) and had shorter hospital length of stay (mean difference, -3.00 [-5.54, -0.47]; p < 0.01) compared with open repairs. There were not enough studies to address the routine use of postoperative antibiotics. Quality was deemed very low with much of the literature being retrospective studies. We conditionally recommend early surgical intervention for adult patients presenting with acutely incarcerated or strangulated inguinal hernias who are deemed to require surgery. We conditionally recommend mesh repairs over primary tissue repairs and laparoscopic approaches over open approaches for this population. No recommendations can be made regarding the routine use of antibiotics. Systematic Review/Meta-analysis; Level III."

Identifying predictors of 30-d mortality and intuitive preoperative laboratory-based futility thresholds may enhance risk stratification and clinical decision-making. We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study of adults aged 18-90 y who underwent cardiac surgery between 2013 and 2023. Patients requiring EGS intervention for gastrointestinal complications during their index cardiac surgery hospitalization were included. Exclusion criteria were intraoperative EGS consultations and consults without surgical intervention. Preoperative laboratory-based futility thresholds and independent predictors of 30-d mortality were identified using multivariable logistic regression. Ninety-five patients met inclusion criteria; 30-d mortality was 51%. Ischemic bowel was the most common diagnosis (56%). Nonsurvivors had higher rates of obesity (body mass index ≥ 30: 42% versus 17%, P = 0.008), elevated Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores (median [interquartile range]: 13 [11-14] versus 10 [7-11], P < 0.001), and end-stage renal disease (60% versus 19%, P < 0.001). They also had higher lactate (7.5 versus 3.4 mmol/L, P < 0.001) and lower platelet counts (83 versus 134 × 103/μL, P < 0.001). Laboratory thresholds associated with 100% 30-d mortality included platelet count < 95 × 103/μL, white blood cell count < 4.3 × 103/μL, lactate > 3.4 mmol/L, and total bilirubin > 3.9 mg/dL. Independent predictors of mortality were SOFA ≥ 11.5 (adjusted odds ratios [aOR] 3.2, P = 0.04), body mass index ≥ 30 (aOR 4.0, P = 0.04), and platelets <100 × 103/μL (aOR 5.9, P = 0.02). Post-cardiac surgery patients involving EGS intervention have high 30-d mortality. Elevated SOFA scores, obesity, and thrombocytopenia are critical predictors, offering opportunities for improved risk stratification and targeted management strategies."

    "abstract": "Enhanced recovery pathways (ERPs) are evidence-based, multimodal strategies designed to promote early recovery and to optimize surgical outcomes. While extensively implemented in elective surgery, their adaptation to emergency general surgery (EGS) raises challenges due to patient instability and limited preoperative time. The study aimed to evaluate the adherence to each ERPs item and the impact on short-term outcomes in patients undergoing emergency general surgery. This is a multicenter observational prospective study carried out in 13 Italian centers. Inclusion criteria targeted adults undergoing surgery for intestinal occlusion or perforation. Patients re-operated after elective surgery were excluded. The primary endpoints were the adherence to intraoperative ERP items and the compliance to the postoperative recovery pathway. Secondary endpoints were postoperative mortality, morbidity, and length of hospital stay. Between March 2023 and March 2024, 760 patients were analyzed. The highest adherence was observed for active warming (97%), PONV prevention (92%), and long-acting opioid avoidance (87%). The lowest adherence was found for invasive arterial pressure monitoring (35%), depth of anesthesia monitoring (34%), locoregional analgesia (31%), and minimally invasive surgery (26%). By postoperative day 3, 66% of patients tolerated solid diets and 58% had discontinued intravenous fluids. Postoperative mortality, morbidity, and major complications occurred in 3%, 33%, and 9% of patients, respectively. Median hospital stay was 7 days. This study underscores the adherence to ERP in EGS, highlighting the potential of ERP to improve perioperative outcomes in a high-risk population. Future research should prioritize strategies to enhance adherence, particularly to underutilized components as goal-directed fluid therapy and minimally invasive surgery and further optimize ERP protocols for emergency settings."

Methods: For analysis, patients were divided into two groups: pre-guidelines (2018-2019) and post-guidelines (2020-2023), following the May 2020 WSES publication. Patients were classified according to the WSES classification. Results: NOM failure and PA after SR rates by groups were as follows (NOM failure not applicable to III-IV): 0-IA, 2.7% and 94.7%; IB-IIA, 16% and 85.2%; IIB, 7.1% and 50%; III-IV, 75.6%. The global stoma-free rate was 78.8%, with a 15.7% anastomotic leak rate and 14.2% significant morbidity, with an increased rate of anastomosis in unstable patients thanks to Damage Control Surgery (DCS). A logistic regression model was performed to identify factors associated with postoperative morbidity. Patients who underwent primary anastomosis had a lower risk of postoperative morbidity compared to those treated with Hartmann's procedure (OR = 0.22 (0.04-1.25), p = 0.088). Conclusions: Excellent outcomes in AD healthcare may be achieved if evidence-based recommendations are followed. The ACSu plays a key role in designing and promoting these protocols."

    "title": "Association of psychosocial risk factors on outcomes of patients undergoing emergency general surgery Accepted at Academic Surgical Congress.",
    "abstract": "Psychosocial risk factors, including depression and developmental disorders, have increasingly been shown to adversely impact postoperative outcomes. Despite their high prevalence, psychosocial risk factors and their associated outcomes after emergency general surgery remain ill-defined. In the present work, we characterized the association of psychosocial risk factors with mortality, postoperative complications, hospitalization costs, and 30-day readmissions after emergency general surgery. The 2016-2021 Nationwide Readmissions Database was queried to identify all adult patients (≥18 years) undergoing emergency general surgery (appendectomy, cholecystectomy, laparotomy, large bowel resection, perforated ulcer repair, or small bowel resection). Patients were grouped into the psychosocial risk factors cohort in the presence of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, diagnosis codes for mental, behavioral, and neurodevelopmental disorders (others: non-psychosocial risk factors). The primary end point was in-hospital mortality whereas several postoperative complications including stroke, thromboembolic, cardiac, renal, respiratory, and infectious complications as well as hospitalization costs, and 30-day nonelective readmissions, also were considered. Multivariable regressions were used to evaluate the association of psychosocial risk factors with outcomes of interest. Among an estimated 2,104,962 patients undergoing emergency general surgery, 51.8% had psychosocial risk factors with a stable incidence over time (52.0% in 2016 to 51.1% in 2021, P = .66). Compared with others, those with psychosocial risk factors were younger (57 [41-69] vs 61 years [44-73]) and less commonly privately insured (26.6 vs 42.2%, all P < .001). After multivariable adjustment, psychosocial risk factors were independently associated with increased odds of acute mortality adjusted odds ratio, 1.12, 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.16), sepsis (adjusted odds ratio, 1.25, 95% confidence interval, 1.23-1.28), pneumonia adjusted odds ratio, 1.34, 95% confidence interval, 1.29-1.38), and renal adjusted odds ratio, renal, 95% confidence interval, .18-1.22) complications. Furthermore, psychosocial risk factors were significantly associated with a +$1,400 increment in hospitalization costs (β+ $1,350.6, 95% confidence interval, 1,200-1,500, P < .001) and +0.61-day increase in length of stay (β+ .61 days, P < .001). Patients with psychosocial risk factors experienced 23% increased odds of 30-day readmission adjusted odds ratio, 1.23, 95% confidence interval, 1.21-1.25). The presence of preexisting psychosocial risk factors was associated with increased mortality, postoperative complications, costs, length of stay, and readmission. Identifying psychosocial risk factors early during hospitalization and integrating interdisciplinary social work and psychiatric care should be studied."

    "abstract": "The introduction of optimised care bundles in emergency major abdominal surgery has reduced mortality. Core elements are fast diagnostic work-up with abdominal computed tomography (CT) and surgery without delay. Given the diagnostic challenges in patients with abdominal pain, we aimed to investigate if the addition of a full contrast-enhanced chest CT provides additional clinically significant diagnostic information in patients referred to an emergency abdominal CT. This retrospective cohort study included patients with suspected major abdominal pathology referred to an emergency abdominal CT with complementary chest CT (extended CT) from 1 April 2020 to 9 September 2020. This population was compared to a historic cohort with a regular emergency abdominal CT. The primary outcome was chest CT findings leading to treatment or intervention during index admission. A total of 187 patients were scanned in the study period and compared to 170 historic controls. The two groups were comparable. The extended CT group had more clinically significant chest findings 28 (15.0%) compared to the standard group 9 (5.3%) (p = 0.002), of which pneumonia was found 18 versus 3 times, respectively. The extended CT group had more suspicious findings 22 versus 7 (p = 0.008) but did not result in significantly more out-patient referrals (8 versus 4, p = 0.38). In patients with suspected major abdominal pathology, an extended CT protocol which includes a full chest CT provides additional diagnostic information without reducing mortality."

    "abstract": "Trauma remains a principal cause of mortality across all age groups, particularly in cases of major abdominal trauma and hemorrhage, which can lead to the 'lethal triad' of coagulopathy, metabolic acidosis, and hypothermia. This systematic review explores the efficacy of Damage Control Laparotomy (DCL) compared to definitive surgery (DEF) in major abdominal trauma. A systematic literature search following PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines was conducted across Medline, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases. Seven studies were found, including one randomized controlled trial (RCT) and six observational studies (OS). Mortality rates varied, with one observational study indicating higher 24-h mortality in the DCS group (OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.48, 4.68, I2 = 86%), while the RCT showed a significantly lower 30-day mortality rate (OR 0.05 (95% CI 0.00, 0.99 P = 0.010). Notably, major complications did not differ significantly between the two approaches (RCT OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.20, 2.77; OS OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.20, 2.77). The overall certainty of evidence was rated low, reflecting heterogeneous outcomes and inconsistent reporting. Although DCS is frequently utilized in trauma care, its superiority over definitive surgery remains unestablished, with ethical considerations complicating randomized trials. This review suggests that while DCS may be beneficial under specific conditions, robust multicentric studies are essential to clarify its impact on mortality and health outcomes compared to conventional surgery in abdominal trauma."

    "abstract": "BackgroundDiverticular disease affects over half of individuals over 60, with 25% developing diverticulitis. While Hartmann's procedure has traditionally been the standard for unstable patients, resection with primary anastomosis and diverting loop ileostomy (PADLI) is associated with higher stoma reversal rates and improved long-term outcomes. Despite evidence supporting PADLI, socioeconomic factors may influence procedural selection, contributing to persistent disparities in care.MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted using the 2015-2021 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) to identify patients undergoing emergent surgery for acute diverticulitis. Patients who received left colectomy or sigmoidectomy were classified by procedure type (Hartmann's vs PADLI) using ICD-10 codes. Demographic and socioeconomic factors were analyzed including age, sex, race, insurance type, income quartile, in-hospital mortality, length of stay, discharge disposition, and urban vs rural residency. The impact of these factors on procedure choice was assessed using multivariate logistic regression.ResultsAmong 14 551 patients, 85.5% underwent Hartmann's procedure and 14.5% received PADLI. Older age (OR 1.014/year, P < 0.001), female sex (OR 1.129, P = 0.011), white race (OR 1.128, P = 0.041), and lower income (OR 1.223, P < 0.001) were associated with higher odds of receiving Hartmann's procedure. Private insurance reduced this likelihood (OR 0.747, P < 0.001). Primary anastomosis and diverting loop ileostomy was more common in metropolitan areas, younger patients, those with private insurance, and those discharged routinely.DiscussionSocioeconomic disparities significantly influence surgical management of acute diverticulitis. Lower-income and publicly insured patients are more likely to undergo Hartmann's procedure, while PADLI is more common in wealthier, urban populations. Addressing these disparities could promote more equitable care and improve patient outcomes."

We hypothesized that fellowship training in acute care surgery (ACS) vs minimally invasive surgery (MIS) results in different LCBDE practices and perceptions, thus producing unique barriers to implementation.MethodsA survey was distributed by email to members of Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons and the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma to assess surgeon demographics, surgeon-specific perceptions, practice patterns, and barriers to LCBDE utilization. Categorical data were compared with Pearson's chi-square, and continuous parametric data were compared with a t test.Results543 US surgeons who perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy completed the survey. Of all, 124 survey respondents were ACS trained and 175 were MIS trained. Similar proportions of MIS and ACS surgeons prefer to manage choledocholithiasis with LCBDE (28% vs 27%, P = 0.79). The most utilized LCBDE technique was choledochoscopy (71% vs 69%, P = 0.17). MIS surgeons more frequently perform intraoperative cholangiogram (IOC) compared to ACS surgeons (P = 0.02). A third of MIS surgeons felt that LCBDE is too time consuming to be of value, vs 25% of ACS surgeons (P = 0.37). When asked if LCBDE is difficult to master, 56% of MIS surgeons agreed compared to 32% of ACS surgeons (P < 0.01).DiscussionBoth MIS and ACS surgeons utilize LCBDE infrequently despite responding that choledocholithiasis should be managed by surgeons. Compared to MIS, fewer ACS surgeons consider time to perform LCBDE and difficulty as barriers. Understanding these barriers can influence education and efforts toward increasing adoption in both groups."

    "abstract": "Although nearly half of the US population has a chronic disease, many remain undiagnosed, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Sociodemographic factors affect access to preventative healthcare, increasing rates of undiagnosed chronic disease. We hypothesize that emergency general surgery (EGS) is an important access point into the healthcare system and sought to characterize factors impacting the new diagnosis of chronic disease during admission for EGS. This was a Level III retrospective cohort study conducted at a single, academic institution. Patients undergoing EGS intervention, including colectomies, cholecystectomy, hernia repair, and peptic ulcer surgeries, were identified during 2018-2019. Univariate descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses were conducted, with χ2 tests for categorical variables and Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous variables. We finally conducted a multivariable logistic regression to identify important factors related to the diagnosis of a new chronic disease. A total of 978 patients were included. Of these, 42.7% received a new diagnosis of chronic disease during their EGS admission. The most common diagnoses were gastroesophageal reflux disease (n=120), obesity (n=116), type 2 diabetes (n=60), and hypertension (n=48). No significant associations were found with sociodemographic factors or prior healthcare visits. Length of stay was significantly longer for those with new diagnoses (p<0.001). Hospital admissions for EGS present a critical opportunity to identify undiagnosed chronic conditions, particularly in patients with limited healthcare access. Length of stay was associated with an increased likelihood of diagnosis. These findings suggest that emergency surgical care can serve as a gateway to preventive care. This study provides Level III evidence of the role of emergency general surgery in chronic disease diagnosis. III."

Successful implementation, however, hinges on buy-in from local clinicians. We assessed clinician support for a potential TFP in Uganda, considering perceived need, curricular recommendations, barriers, and motivating factors. After cognitive interviews with experts and questionnaire pilot testing, we cross-sectionally surveyed Ugandan consultants (general surgeons and procedural specialists involved in trauma care) and surgical residents at a tertiary, national referral hospital. Respondent percentages were calculated for multiple-choice answers, and we performed thematic analysis of free-text responses using a primarily inductive approach. Among 46 faculty (from 13 specialties) and 42 resident respondents, 86% supported a Ugandan TFP. Respondents recommended incorporating emergency general surgery (66%), critical care (84%), and international rotations (76%) into the curriculum. Severe resource and structural deficiencies (82%) and concern about governmental support for post-training employment and compensation (66%) were leading perceived barriers to TFP implementation. Most faculty felt a TFP would improve patient outcomes (93%), overall trainee education (77%), and clinical efficiency (68%). Free-text responses were consistent with survey themes, indicating acute awareness of current trauma system inadequacies and conviction that a TFP would reduce injury-related mortality. Ugandan clinicians who care for injured patients view a TFP as crucial to improving injury-related outcomes, despite known barriers. TFP implementation should incorporate curricular recommendations from this survey and address widespread concerns about financial and infrastructural support from the national government and local institutions."

Rarely, foreign body ingestion can lead to appendicitis, particularly when small objects like lead shot become lodged in the appendix. We present the case of a 30-year-old man with chronic intermittent right lower quadrant pain who presented with an acute exacerbation. Imaging revealed two metallic densities in the appendix without overt signs of inflammation. He underwent laparoscopic appendectomy, which confirmed the presence of two retained lead pellets and histologic evidence of acute appendicitis. The patient had a history of frequent game meat consumption. This case underscores a rare but important etiology of appendicitis and the potential for systemic lead exposure from retained foreign bodies. In patients with relevant social histories and suggestive imaging, clinicians should consider this diagnosis and proceed with timely surgical management to prevent complications."

Among 20 interviewees, the mean age was 45. We identified dominant themes related to the concerns of and benefits of using risk calculators within EGS, both in situations of clear and unclear best treatment options. Surgeons questioned risk calculator validity and noted that a lack of health numeracy can limit their use. Risk calculators were seen as helpful for communication, consensus building, informed consent, and litigation mitigation. The ideal risk calculator should have low activation energy for use, incorporate relevant data and accurate prognostication, and provide actionable, easily interpretable output. Education for providers and patients on risk calculator availability and use is necessary. Although surgeons may initially question the data produced by risk calculators in EGS, they identify several potential virtues to their bedside use when optimal treatment options are and are not clear. The ideal risk calculator for use in EGS should be convenient and relevant. Future studies are needed to explore patient perceptions and to directly observe patterns of risk calculator use."

There is a perception that the laparoscopic approach is limited to large subspecialist centers. This study aimed to investigate the outcomes of these emergency procedures in a non-subspecialized regional center. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis on patients who underwent an emergency Hartmann procedure between 2019 and 2023 within a general surgery unit at a regionally located tertiary-level Australian hospital. Patients were classified as having undergone either OH or laparoscopic Hartmann (LH) procedures. Our primary outcome of interest was length of hospital stay (LOS). Secondary outcomes included time to return of gut function, morbidity, and reversal. Differences between the OH and LH groups were assessed descriptively and using confounder-adjusted regression. We identified 115 patients (83 underwent OH, 32 underwent LH) during the study period. The adjusted estimated mean LOS for patients undergoing an OH procedure was 15.8 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.7-17.9) compared to 9.6 days (95% CI, 7.4-11.9) for patients undergoing an LH procedure. The mean time taken for the return of gut function was estimated to be 34% longer following an OH procedure compared to an LH procedure (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.34 days; 95% CI, 1.00-1.81). Morbidity was similar between groups. The LH group had higher rates of laparoscopic reversal (91.7% vs. 33.3%).

    "abstract": "Introduction Trauma continues to be a major cause of death in the United States, with uncontrolled bleeding contributing to a significant portion of trauma-related fatalities. In recent years, the management of hemorrhagic trauma patients has expanded to include interventional radiology (IR). The American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma recommends that Level 1 and 2 trauma centers ensure IR availability within 60 minutes of the decision to proceed with angiography. Delays in IR intervention are associated with poorer outcomes and increased mortality. To address this, our Level 2 trauma center developed and implemented an institutional protocol involving trauma surgeons, interventional radiologists, residents, trauma advanced practice providers, ED staff, and IR nursing teams to reduce time to intervention for trauma patients with uncontrolled hemorrhage. Methods On March 1, 2023, a new institutional protocol was launched to expedite IR intervention in trauma patients with hemorrhage. When such a patient is identified, the trauma team leader (TTL) directly contacts an IR physician to review imaging and determine the need for urgent endovascular therapy. If IR intervention is agreed upon, the TTL places a STAT IR consult, which marks the start time for time tracking. This time period ends when an IR physician achieves vascular access. To accelerate intervention, the TTL informs the primary nurse of the protocol activation, and a trauma vascular IR (VIR) alert is sent via Vocera®. The primary nurse and VIR charge nurse coordinate room availability, prepare the patient for transport, and ready the IR suite. Results Data were collected prospectively after protocol implementation (beginning March 2023) and retrospectively for the period starting January 2022. The pre-protocol cohort included 11 patients, and the post-protocol cohort included 12 patients. Comparison of the two groups showed a significant reduction in mean consult-to-needle time: 102 minutes ± 39.5 pre-protocol vs. 48.2 minutes ± 12.7 post-protocol (p < 0.001). Conclusions Timely VIR intervention is essential for effective hemorrhage control in trauma patients. Transitioning a patient from the trauma bay to the IR suite requires seamless coordination across multiple teams, and delays can negatively impact outcomes. Establishing a standardized institutional protocol can reduce time to intervention by streamlining workflows and minimizing communication-related delays. While our study is limited by a small sample size, ongoing data collection is expected to further support these initial findings."

Data from an exhaustive literature search conducted across Embase (Ovid), Medline(R) ALL (Ovid), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was summarized. Literature published between January 2013 and December 2024 was included. Most studies found better outcomes for the no-drain group. Implementing a drain after EGS procedures potentially increases hospital stays, postoperative pain, and surgical site infection rates. For conditions such as peritonitis and perforated ulcers, only a few studies were available, with some showing benefits of PD. For some conditions, like colorectal emergencies, there is a scarcity of evidence. The outcomes suggest that PD is not recommended in most EGS cases. In high-risk cases, there are some reports on improved outcomes for PD use. Further research is imperative to create science-based clinical guidelines, especially for less-researched conditions."

A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar for studies published between 2004 and 2024. Search terms included \"tension pneumoperitoneum,\" \"acute pneumoperitoneum,\" \"surgery,\" and \"needle decompression.\" Eligible studies included human case reports, case series, and narrative reviews that addressed the pathophysiology, diagnosis, or management of TPP. Duplicates were removed and a two-step screening process was used to identify studies for inclusion. A total of 78 studies were selected, including 57 patient cases for subanalysis. Of the 57 cases identified, 40 involved adults and 17 involved pediatric patients. The overall survival rate was 84.2% with higher survival observed in the pediatric population (94.1% vs. 80%). Iatrogenic causes were the most common etiology accounting for 56.1% of cases followed by medical (24.6%), traumatic (14%), and idiopathic (5.3%) inciting events. Management strategies included percutaneous decompression alone (26.3%), operative intervention alone (29.8%), combined decompression and surgery (28.1%), and endoscopic management (7%). Non-procedural management was infrequently reported (8.8%). This comprehensive clinical review emphasizes that successful treatment of TPP occurs through early recognition, understanding the variability of precipitating events, and individualized management.

It occurs in approximately 5%-15% of women with endometriosis. Although it rarely leads to obstruction or perforation, there is no clear consensus on its optimal management. Hormonal therapy is considered the first-line treatment for endometriosis; however, the best approach for intestinal involvement remains controversial. This study aims to contribute to the literature by evaluating patients with intestinal endometriosis who underwent surgery for acute abdomen. Sixteen patients who underwent emergency surgery for acute abdomen at the Emergency General Surgery Clinic of İstanbul University-Cerrahpaşa, Cerrahpaşa Medical Faculty of Medicine, between February 2016 and April 2023 were identified. Four patients voluntarily withdrew from the study, and 12 were included in the analysis. Demographic data, laboratory findings, surgical records, length of hospital stay, pathology reports, postoperative complications within the first 30 days, and their management were reviewed. Patients' current health status was assessed through telephone interviews. The mean age of the patients was 39.3+-9.2 years. Nine patients underwent surgery with a preoperative diagnosis of intestinal obstruction, while three were operated on for suspected acute appendicitis. Among the patients with intestinal obstruction, three underwent laparoscopic ileocecal resection, and three had segmental small bowel resection. One patient underwent anterior resection with appendectomy, and another underwent both anterior resection and ileocecal resection with ileocolostomy. One patient underwent a left hemicolectomy. The mean hospital stay was 7.9+-5.9 days. Postoperative complications occurred in three patients (25%). The mean age of patients who experienced complications was significantly higher than that of those who did not (p<0.007). Histopathological examination revealed benign full-thickness endometriosis in all cases. The mean follow-up period was 50.6 months, with no recurrences observed. Acute abdomen due to intestinal endometriosis-related obstruction is extremely rare. In reproductive-aged women presenting with acute abdomen, intestinal endometriosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis. In cases of clinical suspicion, intraoperative consultation with a gynecologist is recommended, and a multidisciplinary approach should be adopted to optimize treatment planning."

    "abstract": "BackgroundTransfer of low-risk emergency general surgery (EGS) patients from a Level I Trauma tertiary care hospital and free-standing emergency department (FS-ED) to an affiliated community hospital saves tertiary care bed days and operating room (OR) time. Patient experience with this process is unknown. The study aims to evaluate the experience and satisfaction during their surgical care episode of transferred low-risk EGS patients.MethodsEGS patients undergoing non-elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy or appendectomy were prospectively identified between May 2023 and March 2024. Patients were divided into groups based on initial assessment location and transfer status: (1) no transfer; (2) tertiary care-ED to community hospital; and (3) FS-ED to community hospital. Data collected included demographics, ED length of stay (ED-LOS), OR characteristics, and 30-day outcomes. Post-discharge, patients were surveyed on safety perceptions, satisfaction, and overall experience using five-point Likert scales and open-ended questions. Responses were analyzed using univariate and thematic analysis.ResultsOf 216 patients identified, 69 participated in the post-discharge survey (32%). There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics and 30-day outcomes between groups, except for hospital LOS (P < 0.01). Most transferred patients were satisfied with the transfer process (84% from FS-ED; 75% from tertiary care hospital). There were no significant differences in information clarity and feelings of preparedness and safety at discharge by discharge location.ConclusionsTransfer of appropriate patients improves capacity and resources at tertiary care hospitals without decreasing patient satisfaction or increasing safety concerns. Standardized education on the transfer process is likely to positively impact patient experience."

    "abstract": "Variation exists in how consultant surgeons identify malnutrition in emergency general surgery (EGS) patients. These relate to differences in surgeon knowledge, understanding, ownership and hospital setting. Little is known regarding how these relate to nonconsultant surgeons, or those with experience of intestinal failure (IF). This study aimed to characterise the awareness, practice and training of general surgeons in the identification of malnutrition in the emergency setting. The survey focused on three domains: perceptions, current practices and nutrition training. Following piloting, EGS surgeons were invited to complete an online survey. Responses were gathered using Qualtrics. Descriptive analysis and associations with surgeon seniority and IF were performed in SPSSv26. Ethical approval was obtained (UREC 050436). Results are reported with reference to the CHERRIES guidelines. The completion rate was 52.1% (148/284), of whom 49.7% were nonconsultant surgeons and 46.6% had experience of IF. Surgeons from all UK regions completed the survey. There was strong agreement across participants that malnutrition can affect surgical outcomes and identifying it was an important skill for surgeons. However, only 37.2% (55/148) were confident in doing so. Surgeons with IF experience were significantly more confident than those without (49.3% vs 26.6%). Training was reportedly poor, and local teaching or a short course aimed at surgeons in training was considered most helpful in the future. Identifying malnutrition in EGS is recognised as an important skill most surgeons feel they are lacking. Support for formal training in this area was high."

This survey aimed to understand current surgical practices in WSCA use in the conservative approach to ASBO, and to evaluate key design and feasibility factors to inform a future controlled trial of WSCA in ASBO. This study is reported in line with CROSS guidance. The survey consisted of 16 questions organised into three sections: respondent characteristics, current decision-making and WSCA use, and opinions on future trial. Pilot testing was conducted before online distribution to surgeons in the UK delivering Emergency General Surgery. Descriptive analysis was performed. Of 73 total respondents, 52 (71.2%) were consultants. When treating ASBO conservatively, 80.8% (59/73) reported using WSCA in more than half of cases, but there was wide variation in timings, use and repeat challenges. Between 71.2% and 89.0% of respondents affirmed their willingness to adhere to specific trial protocols. Regarding feasibility, 76.7% (56/73) of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they would be willing to recruit to a trial and 75.3% (55/73) agreed or strongly agreed that their unit would be able to deliver a trial. The survey revealed widespread acceptance of WSCA as a therapeutic tool in ASBO among emergency general surgeons. Although practices around its administration varied, there was a clear readiness to adopt standardised protocols. The majority of respondents expressed support for a controlled trial comparing WSCA against a placebo."

    "abstract": "Regionalized care has increased interfacility transfers, particularly for emergency general surgery (EGS) patients requiring urgent, specialized care. Air medical transport (AMT) provides rapid transfer with critical care capabilities and is increasingly used for EGS, but its time-saving benefits remain uncertain. This study aims to identify the population of EGS patients undergoing AMT and the distance thresholds where AMT is faster than ground transport. We conducted a retrospective cohort and analyzed EGS patients transferred to our quaternary center from January 2021 to December 2023. Geospatial analysis was used to calculate transport distances, and linear regression assessed the association between transfer time and distance, identifying the threshold where the 95% confidence interval of AMT no longer overlapped with ground transport. We stratified the analysis by weather conditions and peak traffic times. We analyzed 1,713 EGS patients, with 26.4% undergoing AMT. Air medical transport patients were older and more frail and had higher in-hospital mortality rates (27.9% vs. 7.2%) compared with ground transport patients. The most common primary diagnosis for was unspecified sepsis, but AMT patients had more necrotizing soft tissue infections and gastrointestinal bleeds. Air medical transport became faster than ground transport at a threshold of 5.7 miles, increasing to 7.2 miles during adverse weather and 9.1 miles during peak traffic. A random-forest model identified peak traffic and patient sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score as key factors influencing AMT use. Sensitivity analyses showed that including transport priority and year as interaction terms increased the distance thresholds to 17.4 miles and above. This is the first study to examine AMT practice patterns in EGS and quantify distance thresholds for transport efficiency. Total transfer time and choice of transport mode are significantly influenced by weather conditions and peak traffic, highlighting the need data-driven triage protocols. Such protocols will improve timely decision making and optimize patient transfers. Epidemiological; Level III."

Bundled care interventions have been shown to reduce SSI rates in elective procedures, but evidence for their effectiveness in EGS remains limited. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a multifaceted SSI prevention bundle on SSI rates in patients undergoing open EGS. After IRB a prospective before-and-after study at a tertiary referral center between November 2020 and February 2023 was conducted. Consecutive adult patients undergoing open abdominal EGS operations were included. The pre-bundle group received standard care, whereas the intervention group was managed with an 11-point SSI prevention bundle. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definitions of SSI were used. A doubly robust approach with inverse probability weighting and multivariable regression was deployed to adjust for confounders. A total of 343 cases were included: 226 in the pre-bundle group and 117 in the bundle group. Adjusted analysis showed statistically significant risk reductions at 48%, 68%, and 55% for superficial, deep, and intra-abdominal infections, respectively. The bundle group had a significantly shorter median length of stay (8 vs. 13 days, p = 0.010), despite a longer operative time. No differences were observed in the Clavien-Dindo grade of the SSI or the proportion of SSIs presenting post-discharge. Implementation of the SSI prevention bundle significantly reduced infection rates and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing EGS. These findings support the adoption of bundled strategies in emergency surgical care."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are vascular tumors that can cause significant gastrointestinal hemorrhage. While endoscopic treatment is common for other hemorrhagic disorders, its role in GIST-related hemorrhage remains unclear. This study presents a case series of five patients who underwent successful endoscopic hemostasis for upper gastrointestinal GISTs and explores potential risk factors for hemorrhage. This single-center retrospective study included patients diagnosed with upper gastrointestinal GISTs between January 2013 and December 2022. Of the 61 eligible patients, the clinical courses of five patients who underwent endoscopic hemostasis were reviewed. In addition, an exploratory analysis was conducted to identify risk factors associated with GIST-related hemorrhage by comparing hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic groups using univariate analyses. Five patients underwent successful endoscopic hemostasis using hypertonic saline-epinephrine injection and/or clipping for hemorrhage from exposed vessels at the ulcer. Consequently, emergency surgery within 24 h was avoided in all cases, and elective surgery was conducted between 7 and 51 days. Additionally, ulcer formation (odds ratio [OR] 37.20; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.40-582.00; p < 0.01), elevated white blood cell count (OR 1.05; 95% CI 1.01-1.09; p = 0.03), and elevated body mass index (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.02-1.47, p = 0.03) were identified as risk factors for hemorrhage in the exploratory analysis. Endoscopic hemostasis may help avoid emergency surgery in GIST-related hemorrhage when hemorrhage points are clearly visualized. Ulceration may serve as a predictive factor for hemorrhage; therefore, early surgical intervention should be considered in GISTs with ulceration."

    "abstract": "Emergency General Surgery (EGS) has high complication and mortality rates and social factors have been associated with outcomes in national datasets. Social deprivation index (SDI) is a validated geographic area demographic index used to quantify variations in healthcare. We sought to examine the association of SDI with mortality of high-risk EGS procedures at a regional level across a large integrated healthcare system. This is a retrospective cohort study of adult patients with ICD10 codes for EGS diagnoses who underwent high-risk procedures (small bowel resection, colectomy, gastroduodenal repair or resection, or combined procedures) in a large integrated healthcare system from 2017 to 2021. Our primary exposure was SDI. Primary outcome was inpatient mortality. Secondary outcomes were return to OR (RTOR), venous thromboembolism (VTE), and extended length of stay (≥75th percentile by procedure) (ELOS). Outcomes were analyzed by SDI and adjusted for age, race, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, insurance, procedure, and initial shock index using multivariable logistic regression. Facilities were also analyzed by the SDI distribution of their EGS population. A total of 9441 hospital encounters were identified with 2765 high-risk procedure hospital encounters across nine hospitals. Overall inpatient mortality in the study cohort was 8.6 ​%. EGS patients undergoing high-risk procedures from the most disadvantaged areas had higher mortality rates and were more likely to require RTOR than those from the least disadvantaged areas after adjustment for covariates (OR 2.1, p ​= ​0.01; OR 1.9, p ​= ​0.001). SDI is associated with higher mortality and RTOR in EGS patients undergoing high-risk procedures. This study highlights the importance of local or regional area descriptions of population deprivation which may lead to geographically targeted interventions and prevention strategies."

    "abstract": "Interfacility transfer for emergency general surgery is a key strategy for improving access to care. However, lower-intensity transfers are linked to increased costs, poor patient and family experience, and inefficient resource allocation. Clinical and health system characteristics associated with lower-intensity transfers among patients with emergency general surgery conditions remain unclear. We performed a cohort study among adults with emergency general surgery conditions using claims data from Florida and California. Lower-intensity transfers were defined as admissions ≤3 days with discharge to home without procedural intervention. These were compared with greater-intensity transfers (admission >3 days, nonhome discharge, or procedural intervention), lower-intensity nontransfers, and higher-intensity nontransfers. We used multinomial logistic regression to identify patient and facility factors present on admission that were associated with lower-intensity transfer compared with other encounter types. Of 211,466 patients who underwent emergency general surgery, lower-intensity transfers encompassed 0.7% of encounters overall and 30% of transfers. Factors associated with lower-intensity transfer compared with nontransfer included Medicaid insurance, history of bariatric surgery, patients presenting to a critical access hospital, patients with cholecystitis, and patients presenting with higher-complexity surgical disease. Patients presenting to hospitals with advanced gastroenterology and palliative care were less likely to undergo lower-intensity transfer (P < .05 for all). Facility characteristics are associated with lower-intensity transfers among patients who undergo emergency general surgery and may be a future target for policy aimed at improving the efficiency and quality of regional emergency general surgery care. Understanding clinical and resource needs of patients who undergo emergency general surgery may facilitate the development of interventions to support emergency general surgery care in resource-limited settings and triage patients requiring high-complexity care to tertiary and quaternary facilities."

This study assessed hospital characteristics associated with patterns of FOC in EGS patients and the effect of interfacility transfer after FOC on mortality. Using the Nationwide Readmissions Database 2019, we included patients 18 years or older who were admitted to an index hospital with an EGS diagnosis managed operatively and had an emergency readmission within 90 days. Patients were classified into 4 patterns of fragmentation: no FOC, FOC, defragmented care (readmitted to a nonindex hospital, then transferred back), and hyperfragmented care (readmitted to a nonindex hospital, then transferred to another nonindex hospital). Patient severity of illness was defined using severity of illness categories of All Patient-Refined Diagnosis Related Groups (APR-DRG). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify hospital characteristics associated with FOC and the effect of FOC on 90-day mortality. Of 26,100 patients included, 82.5% had no FOC, 16.4% had FOC, 0.3% had defragmented care, and 0.9% had hyperfragmented care. Index hospital characteristics associated with FOC were small size (by number of beds), private investor or government owned, and low EGS volumes. Controlling for hospital and patient characteristics, FOC (odds ratio 1.22; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.47; p = 0.045) was significantly associated with increased 90-day mortality, driven by those with major or extreme severity of illness of APR-DRGs (odds ratio 1.36; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.64; p = 0.001). FOC is associated with worse outcomes in EGS patients. This study highlights the impact of FOC and the hospital characteristics associated with FOC, highlighting the need for further investigation into EGS systems of care."

In lesser-developed countries with inconsistent documentation of comorbid conditions, undiagnosed and progressively worsening comorbidities can worsen EGS outcomes. We aimed to discern the comorbidity index as a predictor of complications and inpatient mortality in EGS using a large South Asian sample population. Data of adult patients with AAST-defined EGS diagnoses at primary index admission from 2010 to 2019 were retrieved. Patients were categorized into predefined EGS groups using ICD-9 CM codes. Primary exposure was comorbidity using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). The primary outcome was inpatient mortality, and the secondary outcome was complication status. Multiple logistic and Cox regression with Weibull distribution was performed. Analysis of 32 280 patients showed a mean age of 40.06±16.87 years. Overall comorbidity, inpatient mortality, and complication rates were 44.6%, 2.42% and 36.37%, respectively. Patients with moderate CCI had the highest complications (AOR 6.61, 95% CI 5.91, 7.37), and severe comorbidity had the highest hazards (AOR 3.79, 95% CI 2.89, 4.98). Male gender, increasing age, emergent admission status, and lack of insurance were associated with moderate and severe CCI, resulting in prolonged length of stay (5.72 and 5.83 days), reduced survival time (20.04 and 21.95 days), and higher mortality rates (10.52% and 9.48%). We identified predictive patient-level factors associated with higher CCI and worse EGS outcomes.

    "abstract": "About 1%-2% of pregnant patients develop conditions that require emergency general surgery (EGS). The diagnosis and management of these conditions can be challenging, as surgeons must carefully balance the needs of the pregnant patient and the developing fetus. We sought to summarize the latest literature guiding surgical management of appendicitis, benign biliary disease, bowel obstruction, and hemorrhoids in pregnant patients. We performed a comprehensive scoping review using OVID Medline for articles published between January 2000 and June 2023 pertaining to EGS and pregnancy. Acute appendicitis, benign biliary disease, and bowel obstructions confer increased risk of adverse maternal and fetal obstetrical outcomes. In general, pregnant patients with acute appendicitis and cholecystitis should undergo appendectomy or cholecystectomy, respectively. The management of biliary colic has significant nuance depending on trimester. While an operative approach is favoured in the first 2 trimesters, the role of surgery in the third trimester is less clear. Nonoperative treatment of each of these diseases can result in significant maternal, and possibly fetal, morbidity. Operative management of bowel obstruction must be determined on a case-by-case basis. In all instances, a laparoscopic approach is preferred, if feasible. A thoughtful approach is crucial for surgeons and institutions caring for pregnant patients with EGS diseases. Treatment should be similar to that in nonpregnant patients, with some important considerations and modifications. Nonoperative or delayed operative management often increases adverse obstetrical events, including death. Environ 1 %–2 % des personnes enceintes devront subir une intervention urgente en chirurgie générale pour un problème de santé dont le diagnostic et la prise en charge sont parfois complexes, car il faut judicieusement prendre en compte les besoins de la personne enceinte et ceux du foetus. Nous avons voulu faire le point sur les directives récemment publiées relativement au traitement chirurgical de l’appendicite, de la maladie biliaire bénigne, de l’obstruction intestinale et des hémorroïdes chez les personnes enceintes. Nous avons procédé à une étude de portée globale à partir du réseau OVID Medline pour y trouver les articles publiés entre janvier 2000 et juin 2023 sur les interventions d’urgence en chirurgie générale et la grossesse. L’appendicite, la maladie biliaire bénigne et l’obstruction intestinale aggravent le risque de complications maternelles et foetales. En général, les personnes enceintes aux prises avec une appendicite ou une cholécystite doivent subir respectivement une appendicectomie ou cholécystectomie. La prise en charge de la colique hépatique varie selon trimestre de grossesse. Une approche chirurgicale est préférable au cours des 2 premiers trimestres, mais son rôle est moins clair pour le troisième trimestre. L’approche non chirurgicale pour chacun de ces problèmes de santé peut comporter une morbidité maternelle significative et une morbidité foetale potentielle. Le recours à la chirurgie pour l’obstruction intestinale est déterminé au cas par cas. Une approche laparoscopique est toujours à privilégier si possible. Les établissements qui ont un service d’obstétrique et les équipes chirurgicales doivent impérativement adopter une approche rigoureuse face à des personnes enceintes nécessitant une intervention en chirurgie générale. Le traitement doit équivaloir à celui qui est destiné aux personnes non enceintes, moyennant certaines considérations et modifications importantes. Les modalités non chirurgicales ou un retard à les appliquer augmentent souvent le risque de complications obstétricales, y compris un risque de mortalité."

However, the exact number of potentially preventable deaths after these procedures is unclear. This study aims to examine potentially preventable and nonpreventable deaths after 7 common emergency general surgery procedures and the clinical management issues associated with potentially preventable deaths. A retrospective analysis of surgical deaths after 7 emergency general surgery procedures-laparotomy, colectomy, adhesiolysis, cholecystectomy, peptic ulcer repair, small bowel resection, and appendectomy-was conducted on Australian and New Zealand Audit of Surgical Mortality data between 2010 and 2022. Deaths were classified into 2 groups: potentially preventable or nonpreventable. Within the study period, 875 deaths (18.5%) were potentially preventable, and 3,848 deaths (81.5%) were not preventable. Potentially preventable deaths had significantly greater rates of overall postoperative complications (57.0% vs 37.0%, P < .001) compared with nonpreventable deaths. The potentially preventable deaths group had also significantly greater rates of clinical management issues in the preoperative (38.6% vs 7.0%, P < .001), intraoperative (21.4% vs 3.2%, P < .001), and postoperative (20.5% vs 4.0%, P < .001) phases of care. Among the most common emergency general surgery procedures, approximately 20% of deaths are potentially preventable. For patients with potentially preventable deaths, the majority of clinical management issues occurred during the preoperative phase of care. The overall clinical management issues identified relate to 14 separate areas of patient care. Further quality improvement projects, such as enhanced recovery after surgery protocols, should address these areas of clinical management issues to improve future patient mortality rates."

This study aims to assess the level of intern involvement in emergency general surgery (EGS) handover and its impact on daily tasks. Overt, structured, non-participant observations of morning EGS handover meetings were carried out to assess intern involvement. The same interns were then observed over the course of the day-shift immediately following the handover. During these observation periods, details of all patient care queries addressed to the interns were recorded. Five general surgery interns (42%) were observed across six EGS handover meetings. A total of 100 clinical queries were recorded during 25 h of observation. Only 2/6 handover meetings had full intern involvement. While all appeared to be actively listening during handover, questions were asked, and readbacks were provided by interns during 4/6 and 3/6 handovers, respectively. Clinical queries directed at interns who were fully involved in the morning handover were more likely to be answered immediately (96.6 %,n = 29 vs. 78.6 %,n = 55; p = 0.024) and using memory of the verbal handover (50 %,n = 15 vs 24.3 %,n = 17; p = 0.012). One incidence of negligible harm occurred, due to omission of a patient's allergy information from the handover. Interns who are fully involved in handover show evidence of learning and are more likely to respond to queries faster and from memory. Reduced involvement in the post-call handover process has the potential to delay, and therefore negatively impact, patient care."

    "abstract": "Background Urgent colectomies constitute a significant portion of acute care surgery (ACS). While general surgeons (GS) typically perform colonic resections, more complex cases, particularly those involving colorectal cancer (CRC) and inflammatory bowel disease, may demand a higher level of expertise. This study examines the outcomes of CRC-related urgent colectomies with end stoma performed by colorectal specialist (CRS) surgeons compared to those conducted by GS without sub-specialization or with sub-specialization other than CRS. Methods This study analyzed data from patients who underwent emergent colectomy with end stoma due to complications related to colon cancer at a single tertiary hospital between 2013 and 2023. Patients were grouped according to the presence of a CRS surgeon in the surgery. The primary outcomes measured were 90-day perioperative complications, including mortality. Secondary outcomes included quality metrics of the resected specimen as well as oncological outcomes.  Results The study included 98 patients undergoing emergent colon resection with end stoma, with a mean age of 70.05 ± 14.6 years and a gender distribution of 60 females to 38 males. The mean Charlson comorbidity score was 4.01 ± 2.6. Colorectal surgeons were present in the operations of 32 patients (32.7%). No significant differences were found in baseline characteristics between the groups. The 90-day complication rate was similar between the CRS and GS groups (40.6% vs. 36.9%, p=0.724), as was the rate of major complications (Clavien-Dindo (CD) ≥3, 12.5% vs. 19.7%, p=0.378). The 90-day mortality rate was lower in the CRS group (6.45% vs. 15.1%), but this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.327). The number of lymph nodes (LN) in the specimen was significantly higher in the CRS group (24.6 ± 13.4 vs. 19.1 ± 8.8, p=0.019); however, inadequate lymphadenectomy rate (defined as fewer than 12 LN) did not differ between the groups (16.7% GS vs. 15.6% CRS, p=0.991). Positive margins were rare, with all occurrences found in the GS group (four radial, one distal, 7.6% vs. 0%, p=0.11). Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated no significant difference in overall survival (log-rank p=0.236) over a median follow-up of 1.5±2.67 years, though the CRS group's curve was consistently higher than that of the GS group. Conclusion Urgent colectomies related to colon cancer show comparable outcomes when performed by GS and CRS, with the exception of a higher lymphadenectomy yield in the CRS group. Given the limitations of the study's small sample size and retrospective design, which may result in underpowering, there is a potential trend toward improved survival and reduced major complication rates for the CRS group that did not reach statistical significance. Future research should investigate this issue in a larger, prospective study."

We measured the textbook outcome (TO), defined as absence of prolonged length of stay (LOS), mortality, major morbidity, readmission, or reoperation within 30 days. Regression analyses were used to compare outcomes between IS and IC groups, stratified by case acuity.ResultsWe identified 16,679 patients, including 1102 (6.6%) IS patients. Immunosuppressed patients were more likely to present with complicated diverticulitis and preoperative sepsis and more often required urgent or emergent surgery, open surgery, or diversion. Textbook outcome was achieved less often in IS patients (37.2% vs 61.5%), and they had higher rates of major morbidity (37.7% vs 19.5%) (P < 0.001). On regression, IS patients undergoing elective surgery were less likely to achieve TO (OR 0.668 [95% CI 0.538-0.830]) and more likely to experience major morbidity (1.356 [1.065-1.726]), prolonged LOS, sepsis, or readmission. In the urgent setting, IS was associated with higher odds of major morbidity (1.595 [1.072-2.372]), readmission (1.877 [1.160-3.037]), and mortality (3.149 [1.549-6.402]). In the emergency setting, IS patients had increased odds of reoperation (1.566 [1.035-2.370]) and mortality (1.545 [1.033-2.310]).ConclusionEmergent or urgent surgery is associated with higher mortality in IS patients compared to IC patients.

The 30-day mortality rate in the super-super-obese group (7.2%) was significantly higher than the morbidly obese (4.1%) and super-obese (5.4%) groups. Compared to morbidly obese patients, super-obese and super-super-obese patients had significantly higher odds for septic shock and reoperation. Super-super-obese patients additionally had significantly higher odds for readmission. These findings suggest that super- and super-super-obese patients warrant tailored perioperative management and separate risk considerations."

    "abstract": "A novel electronic health records (EHR)-based workflow was implemented at a quaternary referral center to improve the efficiency of inpatient surgical consultation processes for patients requiring trauma or acute care surgery (TACS) consultation. The EHR-driven consultation workflow automated notifications, communication of patient information, and data-tracking. Timeliness of care was compared between pre-implementation (1/1/2020-1/31/2022), early post-implementation (2/1/2022-1/31/2023), and late post-implementation (2/1/2023-1/31/2024) cohorts. Of 5724 consultations, 2658 required surgery (733 pre-, 830 early post-, 1095 late post-implementation). Time between consult to OR was reduced overall by 27 ​% post-implementation (pre ​= ​726 ​min; early post ​= ​577; late post ​= ​532; p ​< ​0.001) and by 48 ​% (pre ​= ​531 ​min; early post ​= ​290; late post ​= ​277; p ​< ​0.001) for urgent/emergent cases. Length of stay decreased post-implementation with no difference in 30-day clinical outcomes. Implementation of the novel EHR consultation workflow was safe and associated with decreased time-to-OR, which persisted throughout the post-implementation phase with greatest impact on patients requiring urgent/emergent operations."

    "abstract": "Current research has examined emergency general surgery (EGS) rates and COVID-19 complications for some procedures, but none have explored complications for all seven EGS procedures before and during the pandemic. Our study addresses this gap, aiming to understand how pandemic-related challenges impact patient outcomes. Utilizing data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) spanning 2018 to 2021, we conducted a retrospective cohort study with analysis of open and laparoscopic partial colectomy, enterectomy, cholecystectomy, operative management of peptic ulcer disease, adhesiolysis, appendectomy, and laparotomy. Patient outcomes, including 30-day mortality and morbidity, were assessed. The likelihood of complications in EGS has risen compared to pre-COVID levels. Specifically, there is a greater risk of morbidity in open EGS cases intra-COVID compared to laparoscopic, particularly in colectomy and appendectomy procedures. Conversely, laparoscopic procedures have seen a decrease in readmissions, notably in cases involving cholecystectomy and colectomy. The study highlights a rise in complications for EGS intra-COVID, with open procedures demonstrating higher risks than laparoscopic counterparts."

    "abstract": "An aging population and advances in surgery have led to increasing need for geriatric management of elderly patients undergoing emergency general surgical care. Integration of a proactive geriatric service for these patients may beneficially impact both traditionally measured hospital and patient-based metrics. Here, we synthesize evidence regarding measurable outcomes of embedded geriatric care within emergency general surgery. A comprehensive search was conducted across Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and Scopus databases by two independent reviewers. The included publications reported outcomes of embedded geriatric services in emergency general surgery. Prespecified outcomes assessed in these studies included patient-reported outcomes, length of stay (LOS), mortality rate, complication rate, intensive care admission, readmission rate, and institutionalization. A total 3100 studies were imported, and eight prospective prepost studies were included in the final review. Length of stay, mortality rate, and medical complication rates were the most frequently assessed outcomes, with each recorded in at least 5 of the 8 included studies. 7 of the 8 studies reported reduced LOS, with four of these reporting a statistically significant difference. The results were variable for other hospital outcomes, including mortality, readmission, and complication rates. Only one source reported on patient-related outcomes, utilizing two tools at multiple time points. No significant prepost effects on patient-related outcomes were noted in this study. Published data on integrating geriatric care in emergency general surgery is limited, but decreased LOS is consistently reported. Further research is necessary to confirm wider effects of integrated geriatric care on relevant hospital and patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Septic surgical patients undergoing emergency general surgery represent a distinct population with unique challenges. This study aimed to identify predictors of cumulative 90-d mortality, including clinical and socioeconomic factors, and to analyze causes of death in this cohort. A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients admitted to a surgical intensive care unit from 2011 to 2019 with sepsis (sequential organ failure assessment score ≥2) undergoing emergency intra-abdominal surgery (n = 498). Demographics, comorbidities, sepsis presentation, and socioeconomic metrics, including the area deprivation index (ADI), were analyzed. Independent predictors of mortality were identified using multiple logistic regression. The causes of death were categorized and analyzed. Among 498 patients, 46% (n = 229) died within 90 d. Nonsurvivors were older (65 ± 13.7 versus 61.2 ± 13.5 y, P < 0.01), more often transferred from external facilities (59% versus 46%, P < 0.01), and had higher rates of liver disease, chronic kidney disease, metastatic cancer, obesity, and higher Charlson comorbidity index scores (P < 0.01 for all). Independent predictors of 90-d mortality included admission sequential organ failure assessment scores, serum lactate, obesity, ADI, Charlson comorbidity index, and transfer status. ADI remained a significant predictor, while the distressed communities index did not. Of the deaths, 76.9% were in-hospital deaths, with intra-abdominal catastrophes (35.4%), multisystem organ failure (25.2%), and pulmonary causes (16.4%) as the most common causes. Intra-abdominal catastrophes, multiorgan failure, and pulmonary complications are leading causes of death in septic emergency general surgery patients. ADI is a robust socioeconomic predictor of mortality, underscoring the need for integrating social determinants into risk assessment and tailored care strategies. Developing comprehensive risk models may enhance prognostication and guide clinical decision-making in this critical population."

The program benefits remain contested in comparison to other surgery practice models. We compared the efficiency of care for nonelective cholecystectomies (CCYs) across 4 different surgery practice models within a single hybrid urban hospital system. Adult patients admitted through the emergency department who underwent CCY for acute biliary disease between January 2018 and December 2023 were categorized into 4 groups: ACS (ACS-main campus [MC]), non-ACS faculty (faculty physicians [FP]-MC), private practice (private practice physicians [PPP]-MC), and community practice (PPP-community hospital [CH]). The primary outcomes were the interval from admission to surgery and hospital length of stay. Secondary outcomes included surgery on a weekend, hospital costs, and readmission within 30 days. Comparison was performed with ANOVA. During the 6-year study period, there were a total of 2,247 CCY: ACS-MC (43.3%), PPP-MC (28.3%), PPP-CH (19.4%), and FP-MC (9.0%). ACS-MC patients had the lowest time interval from admission to surgery (median 25.1 vs 61.1 hours for FP-MC, 33.2 hours for PPP-MC, and 30.3 hours for PPP-CH, p < 0.001). ACS-MC patients had the lowest median hospital length of stay (2 days), and 93.7% of ACS-MC cases were covered by a general surgery resident. PPP-CH had the lowest overall cost. In an era of accelerated consolidation in healthcare markets, the results of this study may provide insight on how large healthcare systems may take advantage of the efficiency of the ACS model to ensure timely and quality care, at the lowest cost."

The impact of an active cancer diagnosis on the short-term outcomes of emergent laparotomy is not well described. A retrospective analysis was conducted using an institutional database comprised of patients admitted from 2015 to 2019 who underwent exploratory laparotomy within 6 h of surgical consultation. The postoperative outcomes of patients with and without an active cancer diagnosis were compared using univariate and multivariable analysis with adjustment for clinical and demographic variables. Among 409 patients who met inclusion criteria, 320 (78.2%) were without an active cancer diagnosis and 89 (21.8%) had an active cancer diagnosis. Patients with cancer were older (median [interquartile range], 63 [56, 70] y versus 59 y [49, 69], P = 0.0001) and presented with higher number of acute severity measures (17.9% versus 13.1%, P = 0.017). Patients with cancer had higher odds of 90-d mortality (adjusted odds ratio: 12.0, 95% confidence interval: [4.9, 29.3]) and 90-d systemic complications (adjusted odds ratio 2.4, 95% confidence interval: [1.26, 4.50]). Patients with cancer who died during index hospitalization received more inpatient palliative care consultations (53.3% versus 25.7%, P = 0.0336) and experienced more systemic complications postoperatively (45.2% versus 17.0%, P = 0.0038). An active cancer diagnosis is independently associated with worse postoperative outcomes following emergent laparotomy. These findings should inform individual and shared decision-making regarding the role of emergency surgery and are relevant for future patient-centered research in oncologic emergencies."

In other settings, this group experiences barriers to communication that are likely exacerbated by acute surgical admission. Despite their likely vulnerability, this topic remains understudied. We conducted an exploratory qualitative study to understand communication of older adults with English Proficiency (EP) and LEP hospitalized for trauma or EGS. Trauma/EGS service inpatients aged ≥65 with mild or no cognitive impairment were purposively sampled at a safety-net, level one trauma center. Semi-structured interviews were held with patients and family when present, using interpreters for LEP. Interviews transcripts were 20% triple-coded and thematically analyzed using modified grounded theory within an interpretivist paradigm. LEP transcripts were also examined for interpretation errors. Twenty-three patients enrolled, 8 with LEP (Spanish, Cantonese, Russian). Three themes emerged: 1. Lack of Information - both groups expressed limited knowledge of their care 2. Loss of Autonomy - both groups endorsed reliance on providers. 3. Feedback and Advocacy - Participants with EP and family members of LEP critiqued care and endorsed the importance of self-advocacy; participants with LEP were reluctant to offer critical feedback. All interviews with professional interpreters contained errors. Differences in EP and LEP participants' self-advocacy and critiques suggest that language proficiency and communication style contribute to communication barriers after trauma and EGS. Difficulties are likely compounded by professional interpreter errors. Our study generates foundational evidence for further exploration of these factors and their effects on patient outcomes."

Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) has recently emerged as a tool to assess intestinal viability in bowel ischemia. However, DECT's diagnostic accuracy for bowel necrosis in clinical practice remains undefined. Methods This single-center retrospective cohort study at a Japanese tertiary care hospital assessed DECT's diagnostic accuracy for bowel necrosis. We included patients who underwent emergency operations for abdominal conditions with bowel ischemia from April 2013 to March 2022. Patients without DECT were excluded. The reference standard was bowel necrosis determined by surgical findings. Four evaluators (two residents and two specialists) independently reviewed DECT images blinded to confirmed diagnoses. We calculated pooled and individual sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, and accuracy. Results Twenty-eight patients were included. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.65 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.52-0.77) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.70-0.92), respectively. Residents demonstrated higher sensitivity than specialists. Pooled positive and negative likelihood ratios were 3.76 (95% CI, 2.02-7.00) and 0.42 (95% CI, 0.29-0.61). Overall accuracy was 0.73 (95%CI, 0.64-0.81). Inter-evaluator agreement was moderate (Fleiss' kappa, 0.42). Conclusion DECT demonstrated moderate diagnostic accuracy for bowel necrosis in this Japanese tertiary care setting. While clinically valuable, DECT's diagnostic capability was not definitive. To optimize DECT's potential, future research should employ disease-specific image reconstruction techniques and provide evaluators with specialized DECT interpretation training."

Additionally, an innovative visual scoring system called geriatric emergency perioperative risk index (GEPR) was devised based on this model. A retrospective database of geriatric patients who had undergone EGS was used for the development of the AI model and GEPR. The study employed a specialized algorithm, comprising of four sequential steps namely scale prototype selection, clinical data collection and collation, AI model development, and GEPR development. In total, 1500 patients with the mean age of 69.8 ys were enrolled in the study. RandomForestClassifier algorithm outperformed the other AI models. Based on the feature importance, GEPR was derived, with a total score range of 0-26. The C-statistic of GEPR for in-hospital mortality was 0.872 (95% confidence interval, 0.840-0.905). The observed probability of in-hospital mortality gradually increased from 0% at a score of 0 to 63.3% at a score of 12 and 100% at a score of 15. Using patient-related and technical parameters, a GEPR model derived from AI algorithms for prediction of surgical complications in geriatric EGS was developed. The GEPR model reliably predicts postoperative in-hospital mortality in geriatric EGS patients. Clinical studies are currently being conducted to validate the stability and precision of the GEPR model utilizing the MIMIC-IV database. Further prospective multicenter trials are needed to externally validate the developed model."

Inclusion criteria consisted of studies that were peer reviewed, obtainable in English, used SVI as a measurement applied to EGS. Of the initial 1216 papers 11 studies met inclusion criteria.ResultsHigh SVI is associated with increased mortality, respiratory, cardiac and bleeding complications, and readmissions. Acute cholecystitis showed higher SVI linked to an increased likelihood of requiring emergent cholecystectomy. Investigations into bowel-related surgeries show connections between high SVI and increased stoma creation and likelihood of emergent operations.ConclusionThere is evidence of correlation between SVI and a variety of poor outcomes in emergency general surgery patient. This suggests that SVI can serve as an indicator of high risk patients as well as allow there to be inventions in specific communities to improve health care outcomes."

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common diseases worldwide and is a known significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Specifically, DM and stress-induced hyperglycemia (SH) significantly increase morbidity and mortality in trauma patients. It is currently unknown how complication rates compare between trauma patients with SH and DM as well the rate of undiagnosed diabetes in trauma patients. The institutional review board at our institution reviewed and approved the following study. A practice management guideline was established calling for the collection of a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) on all trauma patients admitted with a blood glucose of >100 mg/dL. A retrospective review was performed on 417 trauma patients and were stratified into two groups: DM (elevated HbA1c with/without elevated SH ratio) or SH (elevated SH ratio only). Statistical analyses were then completed using the following data points: basic demographic data, hospitalization data, and complication rates. A total of 417 patients underwent hemoglobin with A1c testing due to glucose of >100. Of these, 17 were excluded due to normal HbA1c and normal SH ratio. SH patients were noted to be younger, had a lower body mass index, had a lower admission Glasgow Coma Scale, had a higher injury severity score, and were more likely to require operative intervention on arrival (26.8% versus 15.0%; P = 0.01). Patients with DM were more likely to suffer from cardiovascular complications (11.5% versus 4.9%; P = 0.01); however, they suffered similar rates in mortality, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, and other complications between the two groups. Of note, we were able to diagnose 19 patients with DM (4.5%) and 42 with pre-DM (10.0%) without a previous history of either disease. SH patients tended to be sicker on arrival but overall suffered similar complication rates compared to patients with DM. Additionally, HbA1c is a feasible tool to screen for occult DM in trauma patients. Future areas of research will focus on implementing a similar practice management guideline for our emergency general surgery service."

    "abstract": "Living in a food desert may increase the risk of health conditions related to biliary disease, such as obesity. However, there is limited understanding of food deserts' relationship with biliary disease. In this retrospective study, we explored food deserts in our region and examined the relationship between food deserts and biliary severity and outcomes using food census tracts. We performed a retrospective review of 1609 patients presenting to our urban safety-net hospital that underwent cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis, acute biliary pancreatitis, and choledocholithiasis between 2020 and 2021. Patients undergoing elective or outpatient cholecystectomy were excluded. Our primary end point was the association between living in a low-income and low-access to food (LILA) census tract and severity of biliary disease. Secondary end points included assessing associations between body mass index (BMI) and 30-d readmission, and geospatial patterns of BMI, severity of disease, and readmission. Statistical tests and the Getis-Ord Global Gi and local G statistic were performed for intergroup differences and geospatial mapping. The median age was 39 y (29-49); 76% of patients were female, 84% identified as Hispanic, and 8.5% Black. Geospatial hotspots in LILA census tracts were identified and were significant for patients with higher BMI (P < 0.001) but not significant for 30-d readmissions (P = 0.12). Hotspots of patients with greater median disease severity were not in LILA census tracts and were not significant (P = 0.3). Overweight and/or obese patients undergoing cholecystectomy were more likely to reside in LILA census tracts. There was no association with disease severity or readmission and residing in a LILA census tract. Higher BMI was more prevalent in LILA census tracts in this single-center study. There was no significant association between patient severity of disease and 30-d readmission, but there was overlap between readmission hot spots and LILA census tracts in geospatial analysis. We will continue to explore the relationship between food deserts and our patients' outcomes for targeted interventions to address any disparities."

A discrete choice experiment was used to determine the impact of six variables on surgeons' treatment preferences for commencing nutritional support in EGS. Twenty-five hypothetical scenarios regarding a patient with adhesional small bowel obstruction were disseminated electronically. Binomial logistic regression was used to identify significant associations. Ethical approval was obtained (UREC 050436). In all, 148 participants responded providing 3700 scenario responses. Completion rate was 52.1% (148/284) with an approximately even split of consultants and non-consultants (50.7% vs. 49.3%) and intestinal failure (IF) experience (46.6% experienced vs. 53.4% not experienced). Consultants favoured starting nutritional support (77.7%; 1443/1875) more often than non-consultants (71.8%; 1310/1825). Forming an anastomosis, hypoalbuminaemia, underweight (body mass index <18.5 kg/m2), unintentional weight loss (>10%), ≥5 days without oral intake until now and ≥5 days likely to be without oral intake from now were statistically more likely to be associated with treatment preference, but obesity (body mass index >30 kg/m2) was not.

Four days earlier, the patient had visited the emergency department with symptoms of sore throat, fever, and myalgia. Due to the relatively benign presentation, further workup was deferred in favor of a presumed infectious etiology. This delay in diagnosis led to the patient presenting with life-threatening injuries, necessitating an emergent splenectomy. Subsequent evaluation revealed an underlying diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), which ultimately caused the splenic rupture.

Patients with neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDD) were identified using ICD-10 codes for the most common diagnoses in this category and matched to controls in a 1:2 ratio based on age, gender, and race/ethnicity. Our results indicate that patients with NDD presented significantly more often with complicated appendicitis with an odds ratio of 2.15 (p ​= ​0.003), had greater LOS, and more post-operative complications.

    "abstract": "The Acute Care Surgery (ACS) model has evolved to provide structured care across trauma, critical care, and emergency general surgery. This innovative model effectively addresses significant challenges within trauma care. Research indicates that trauma surgeons operating under this expanded scope deliver high-quality care while enjoying professional satisfaction. This article discusses the introduction of the ACS model in Taiwan. Before the 1990s, Taiwan's trauma care system relied on general surgeons who operated under an \"on-call\" model, lacking dedicated trauma specialists. Significant reforms were initiated in 2009, when the government implemented a grading system for hospital emergency capabilities, categorizing hospitals into three levels: General (offering 24 h services), Intermediate (capable of managing stable trauma cases), and Advanced (providing comprehensive care for critically ill patients). All medical centers are classified as advanced level hospitals and are equipped with trauma teams. However, these trauma teams operate under various models, ranging from those focused exclusively on trauma to others with comprehensive responsibilities. The trauma center at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH) adopted a comprehensive ACS model, encompassing the entire spectrum of care from emergency admission to discharge, all led by trauma surgeons. This approach ensures continuity and coordination in trauma patient care. Additionally, the model integrates emergency general surgery and surgical critical care, broadening the scope of practice for trauma surgeons and enhancing their overall capabilities, providing significant flexibility in their career paths. The ACS model implemented at CGMH has achieved remarkable success, establishing it as a leading trauma center in Taiwan. The emergence of the ACS model aims to reverse the decline in the trauma field that began decades ago. This model not only helps retain skilled professionals but also maintains the expertise of trauma surgeons, ensuring that trauma patients receive the highest quality of care."

    "abstract": "Presentation during nights and weekends has been associated with variations in care and poor outcomes for many time-sensitive conditions such as trauma, stroke, and cardiac arrest. We sought to determine whether variation in clinical care and outcomes exists for patients treated by the emergency general surgery service at our trauma center. We performed a retrospective cohort study at a Level 1 trauma center (2017-2022) of emergency general surgery patients who transferred from other facilities or presented directly to the emergency department. The primary exposure variable was presentation during nights and weekends versus weekdays. To test for changes in the volume of interfacility transfers, the primary outcome was transfer status. The secondary outcome was mortality. We performed risk adjustment using demographic data, payer status, and preexisting conditions. We conducted subgroup analyses for predominant diagnoses and sensitivity analyses by defining \"off-hours\" using alternative times. The study included 7,274 patients, including 5,303 (72.9%) who arrived during off-hours and 3,195 (43.9%) transfers. Mortality was 6.5% (n = 472 patients). Off-hour presentations were associated with a significantly greater risk-adjusted likelihood of presenting as a transfer (adjusted odds ratio, 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.87-2.40), a finding consistent across all subgroups except for patients with appendicitis, choledocholithiasis, or pancreatitis. Increases in age, interfacility transfer, decreases in initial systolic blood pressure, and increases in initial heart rate were all associated with a statistically significant increased risk of mortality. However, we found no difference in mortality based on timing of presentation (adjusted odds ratio, 0.80; confidence interval, 0.63-1.01). All findings were robust to sensitivity analyses. Nights and weekends were associated with increased rates of interfacility transfer, although mortality was no greater than during weekdays. These findings have implications for staffing at both the referral and referring hospitals to optimize the timely treatment of patients with surgical emergencies.

    "abstract": "This review explores advances in risk stratification tools and their applicability in identifying and managing high-risk emergency general surgery (EGS) patients. Traditional risk assessment tools have several limitations when applied to complex EGS patients as comorbidities are generally treated in a binary, linear and sequential fashion. Additionally, some tools are only usable in the postoperative period, and some require multidisciplinary involvement and are not suitable in an emergency setting. Frailty in particular - for which there are multiple calculators-maladaptively influences outcomes. Artificial intelligence tools, such as the machine-learning-based POTTER calculator, demonstrate superior performance by addressing nonlinear interactions among patient factors, offering a dynamic and more accurate approach to risk prediction. Integrating advanced, data-driven risk assessment tools into clinical practice can help identify and manage high-risk patients as well as forecast outcomes for EGS patients. Such tools are intended to trigger preoperative interventions as well as discussions that ensure goal-concordant care, align expectations with anticipated outcomes and support both facility and patient-relevant outcomes."

    "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested that surgeon years of experience are associated with postoperative outcomes for emergency general surgery (EGS) patients and that there may be a benefit to obtaining input from colleagues in high-risk EGS cases. We aimed to assess current EGS practices regarding obtaining a second opinion for emergency cases and barriers to doing so across an acute care surgery network. Surgeons providing EGS coverage across a cohort of hospitals comprising an acute care surgery network were queried in this original research survey study. Survey questions targeted surgeon perception of factors related to increased mortality and current practice regarding barriers to obtaining input from a colleague. Forty-eight surgeons responded to the survey (80%). Surgeons perceived patient age 70 years or older and American Society of Anesthesiologists score ≥3 to be the highest risk factors for mortality. Surgeons reported that, in 23% of cases, they obtained input from a colleague most commonly because of case complexity. About a third of the time input impacted the decision to operate or operative approach. The most significant barrier to obtaining input from a colleague was the time of day/night. Obtaining input from a surgical colleague is not uncommon in current practice and often impacts the care plan. The most significant barrier to obtaining colleague input may potentially be overcome by creating a cohort of trusted surgeons within a health system who are available for consultation at all times of day and night. Future studies to elucidate how to identify trusted surgeons and the impact of such a structure on patient outcomes are needed. Therapeutic/Care Management; Level IV."

    "abstract": "Palliative care includes effective communication, relief of suffering and symptom management with an underlying goal of improving the quality of life for patients with serious illness and their families. Best practice palliative care is delivered in parallel with life-sustaining or life-prolonging care. Palliative care affirms life and regards death as a normal process, intends neither to hasten death nor to postpone death and includes but is not limited to end-of-life care. Palliative care encompasses both primary palliative care (which can and should be incorporated into the practice of acute care surgery) and specialty palliative care (consultation with a fellowship-trained palliative care provider). Acute care surgeons routinely care for individuals who may benefit from palliative care. Patients exposed to traumatic injury, emergency surgical conditions, major burns and/or critical surgical illness are more likely to be experiencing a serious illness than other hospitalized patients. Palliative care research is urgently needed in acute care surgery. At present, minimal high-quality research is available to guide selection of palliative care interventions. This narrative review summarizes the current state of research challenges and opportunities to address palliative care in acute care surgery. Palliative care research in acute care surgery can rely on either primary data collection or secondary and administrative data. Each approach has its advantages and limitations, which we will review in this article."

    "abstract": "The Healthcare Economics Committee of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma has published a series of three articles on the topic of value in acute care surgery (ACS). In this series, the key elements of value, cost and outcomes, and the impact of stakeholder perspective on what constitutes high-value care are discussed. The fourth article in this series continues the discussion by focusing on the unique economic value that an ACS service brings to a hospital system and its patients. Characterized by the immediate 24-hour availability of surgeons trained in trauma management, emergency general surgery, and surgical critical care, acute care surgeons extend the benefits of surgical rescue and critical care to all hospitalized patients. As such, an ACS service acts as a vital part of a hospital's infrastructure to successfully care for complex and seriously ill patients, in addition to enabling the establishment of other, high revenue-generating services such as vascular, transplant, and complex oncologic surgery programs. The trauma service acts as intake for patients that lead to downstream revenue creation by other disciplines such as orthopedic and neurological surgery, while trauma center designation itself results in dedicated state funding to ensure trauma readiness in many states in the United States. The traditional \"value equation\" in health care of outcomes achieved per dollar spent is ill-suited to capture many of these unique aspects and benefits of ACS. This article provides the background to understand the economic value of an ACS service and future directions toward improving overall value of care."

    "abstract": "Incisional hernias (IH) occur after 20-30% of laparotomies. Modern closure techniques including small bite closure and prophylactic mesh augmentation (PMA) demonstrate significant reduction in IH rates. European and American Hernia Society guidelines suggest use of small bite closure and consideration of PMA at elective laparotomy closure but do not make a recommendation for emergency surgery. International surveys demonstrate poor uptake of small bite closure and PMA. This survey aims to assess the uptake of these techniques specifically in emergency abdominal surgery. An online, cross-sectional survey was circulated through emergency general surgery (EGS) and abdominal closure networks between June and August 2024. This interrogated surgeons' technical approach to all elements of emergency laparotomy closure including use of wound bundles, small bite, suture-to-wound ratio, suture choice, and PMA. The survey was completed by 234 general surgeons from 32 countries. Wound bundle components varied between surgeons. Small bite closure was used by 85.8% during midline laparotomy closure but only 42.2% of surgeons used 5 mm wide tissue bites placed every 5 mm. Suture-to-wound ratio was rarely measured (7.7%). A looped PDS (size 0 or 1) was used preferentially (42.7%). Self-locking (15.8%) and antiseptic coated sutures (20.2%) were used infrequently. One in ten surgeons used PMA and most often placed the mesh in the retrorectus space (39.6%). Uptake of new techniques in emergency laparotomy has been variable and with limited penetrance amongst emergency general surgeons. Many surgeons are using adapted versions of the original descriptions of these approaches."

We compared the discriminatory power of 4 risk prediction models across a national cohort of patients who underwent emergency general surgery to assess outcomes of interest. Adults undergoing emergency general surgery (large bowel resection, small bowel resection, repair of perforated ulcer, cholecystectomy, appendectomy, lysis of adhesions, or laparotomy) were identified in 2016-2021 Nationwide Readmissions Database. Patients were grouped into frail and non-frail cohorts on the basis of various frailty instruments: Hospital Frailty Risk Score, Modified 5-factor Frailty Index, Modified 11-factor Frailty Index, and Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups index. Multivariable regressions were developed to assess independent associations between frailty instruments and in-hospital mortality as well as a composite of perioperative complications. Of 1,385,505 hospitalizations for emergency general surgery, 57.0%, 29.9%, 26.6%, and 10.5% were identified as frail by mFI-11, Hospital Frailty Risk Score, Modified 5-factor Frailty Index, and Adjusted Clinical Groups, respectively. After multivariable adjustment, Hospital Frailty Risk Score demonstrated the greatest discriminatory power for predicting in-hospital mortality and perioperative complications when compared with other frailty indices. Subjects classified as frail using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score were associated with the greatest risk of mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 7.8; 95% confidence interval, 7.4-8.3) and composite complications (adjusted odds ratio, 8.4; 95% confidence interval, 9.3-8.5) compared with other indices across all frailty levels. Among patients undergoing emergency general surgery, Hospital Frailty Risk Score demonstrated the greatest discrimination in predicting mortality and composite complications. Risk-stratification efforts should prioritize Hospital Frailty Risk Score in elderly patients undergoing emergency general surgery to optimize clinical outcomes and resource allocation."

    "abstract": "This review is both timely and relevant as the open abdomen approach to manage injury, emergency general surgery (EGS) conditions, as well as secondary intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and the abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) remain prevalent throughout ICUs. IAH is not limited to those with injury or EGS conditions, as it is increasingly recognized following cardiac surgery as well as cardiac transplantation. IAH monitoring techniques benefit from technological advances including noninvasive devices. Time to primary fascial closure (PFC) is a key determinant of patient-centered outcomes, with worse outcomes in those with delayed or failed closure attempts. Visceral edema avoidance or mitigation techniques remain controversial. Nutrition support and its impact on the gastrointestinal microbiome appear to influence infection risk and anastomotic integrity. Team-based approaches to successful as well as failed open abdomen management help optimize outcomes. These findings bear broad implications for intensive care medicine clinicians who care for open abdomen patients, as they address resuscitation, intra-abdominal pressure monitoring, and nutrition support all of which influence the likelihood of achieving PFC - a key goal regardless of whether the abdomen was initially left open after injury, EGS, or intestinal ischemia management."

Our study aimed to identify EGS patients who underwent surgical intervention and compare their outcomes to those who underwent nonoperative management. Data from patients aged ≥ 18 years with primary index admission and EGS conditions defined by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma from Pakistan's first Joint Commission International Accredited Center were analyzed from 2010 to 2019. The primary exposure was surgical intervention. Differences in inpatient mortality, complications, and length of stay (LOS) were compared using logistic and generalized-linear models after coarsened exact matching. Records from 32,280 primary index admissions showed a higher number of younger patients (mean 47.83 vs. 52.40 years) and no preexisting conditions (60.22% vs. 42.30%) in the operated group compared to the nonoperated group. There were relatively higher uninsured individuals in the nonoperated group compared to the operated group (84.36% vs. 74.22%), respectively. Risk-adjusted differences in outcomes showed higher odds of complication (AOR 1.34 and 95% CI 1.20 and 1.48) and prolonged LOS (β 0.78 and 95% CI 0.65 and 0.91) in operated patients. The risk-adjusted observed/expected rates showed lower inpatient mortality rates in operated patients across all EGS diagnoses. The results showed that patients who underwent surgery had lower risk-adjusted mortality even though they had more complications across all EGS diagnoses, which highlights the urgent need to improve surgical access in developing countries due to higher uninsured individuals in the nonoperated group. Also, the findings stress the need for risk stratification and further studies to mitigate risks and optimize patient recovery based on patient-level factors."

However, there is a dearth of literature on weekend effects in low- and middle-income countries like Pakistan. This study aimed to assess the role of the \"weekend effect\" on the outcomes of emergency general surgery patients admitted to a tertiary care center in Pakistan. Data from adult patients with emergency general surgery conditions defined by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma with primary index admissions from 2010 to 2019 from a tertiary care center in Pakistan were analyzed. The outcomes of interest were severe adverse events, in-patient mortality, and failure to rescue. Multiple logistic regression obtained an adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. Records from 32,280 emergency general surgery patients showed that most patients were aged 41-60 years (38.60%) and were male (53.50%). Most patients (76.68%) were admitted on weekdays. Severe adverse events (40.01% vs 33.99%) and in-patient mortality (2.96% vs 2.25%) were significantly higher on weekends than weekdays but had no association with failure to rescue. The odds of severe adverse events (adjusted odds ratio: 1.23; 95% confidence interval: 1.16, 1.30) and in-patient mortality (adjusted odds ratio: 1.16; 95% confidence interval: 1.00, 1.37) were higher on weekends than on weekdays. Having no health care coverage was also a significant factor in the worst outcomes. Weekend admissions are associated with increased severe adverse events and mortality, indicating possible disparities in care quality during weekends. Strategies to improve weekend care could enhance outcomes. Further studies should control for case-mix differences by admission day."

The aim of this study was to investigate if we overused this strategy and if it improved the postoperative course of our patients. Emergency laparotomies from 2017 and 2023 were reviewed and stratified according to OA and closed abdomen (CA). Differences were balanced by inverse probability weighting, and the 90-day mortality was estimated. Subgroup analysis was carried out for patients with a Mannheim Peritonitis Index (MPI) of >26, bowel obstruction, bowel ischemia (BI) and gastrointestinal perforation. Of the 320 patients, 167 were CA and 153 were OA. Groups were different for American Society of Anesthesiologists, comorbidities, transfusion rate, Physiologic and Operative Severity Score for the Study of Mortality and Morbidity score, MPI, Clinical Frailty Scale score, diagnosis, and resection. Two balanced pseudo-populations were created. The 90-day survival rate was 50.8% for CA and 60.8% for OA (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; confidence interval [CI], 0.40-1.55; p = 0.502). At the Cox regression, the Clinical Frailty Scale score (HR, 1.125; 95% CI, 1.01-1.25; p = 0.033) and BI (HR, 5.531; 95% CI, 2.37-12.89; p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for mortality. Transfusion rate (odds ratio [OR], 3.44; 95% CI, 1.44-8.23; p < 0.006) and length of stay in the intensive care unit (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.07-1.20; p < 0.001) were associated with major complications. Open abdomen did not modify mortality in the case of bowel obstruction, MPI >26, or gastrointestinal perforation. Finally, OA (HR, 0.056; 95% CI, 0.01-0.22; p = 0.001) and large bowel resection (HR, 6.442; 95% CI, 1.28-32.31; p = 0.040) were predictors of longer survival in the subgroup of patients with BI. Open abdomen was not associated with a higher complication rate or higher mortality but did result in a longer in-hospital stay.

Disparities and inequities are documented for the emergency general surgery population and its emergency colorectal subset.

We summarize the scope of literature that evaluates inequities in patients who undergo emergency colorectal surgery using two equity-based frameworks. We conducted a systematic search using Medline, Embase, and Web of Science Core Collection databases. Articles were evaluated for inclusion based on evaluation of disparities, inequities, and social determinants in patients who underwent emergency abdominal colorectal surgery in the United States between 2014 and 2024. We extracted data based on components of the PROGRESS (place of residence, race/ethnicity/culture/language, occupation, gender/sex, religion, education, socioeconomic status, social capital) framework and classified studies based on the Phases of Health Disparity Research framework. Twenty-two articles met inclusion criteria. Race/ethnicity was most commonly evaluated in studies (86%) followed by socioeconomic status/insurance status/income. Sex/gender, social support, language, social support, and religion were less commonly evaluated. The majority of the studies focused on malignant disease were in the detecting phase of disparities research. Future studies evaluating inequities in the emergency colorectal surgery population should consider a comprehensive analysis of social factors and measures of structural racism."

This study aimed to evaluate the short-term risk profile of mesh prophylaxis in the context of a burst abdomen. This is a single-center prospective study of patients suffering from burst abdomen from 2021 to 2023. A treatment protocol for the management of burst abdomen was introduced, including the synthetic, partially absorbable onlay mesh. Adult patients (≥ 18 years) with a life expectancy of > 1 year with no plans of future pregnancies were recommended to be treated with a prophylactic mesh. In this analysis, adult patients were included if they suffered from a burst abdomen after elective or emergency laparotomy. The study evaluates short-term outcomes, including 90-day wound complications, length of stay, and mortality. Sixty-seven patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and underwent treatment for a burst abdomen during the study period. Thirty-eight patients were treated with a suture-only technique, and 29 patients were supplemented with a mesh. 13 of 14 observed wound complications in the mesh group were of mild degree (Clavien Dindo 1-3b), while one patient (3%) needed mesh-explantation. The 90-day mortality rate was 21% and comparable between suture-only and mesh techniques. Mesh augmentation in surgery for a burst abdomen seems safe in well-selected patients at 90 days follow-up.

Direct peritoneal resuscitation (DPR), whereby the open abdomen is continuously irrigated with glucose-based hypertonic dialysate, is a valuable adjunct that improves abdominal closure rates and decreases wound complications. Infectious implications of its use remain underexplored. Objective: To assess the impact of DPR on the incidence intra-abdominal fungal infections (AFIs) in critically ill surgical patients. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed of trauma and emergency general surgery patients undergoing DCL with and without DPR at our level 1 trauma center. The effect of DPR on the primary outcomes was assessed using two-stage logistic regression models. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) models were used to evaluate the leading factors contributing to the primary outcome. Results: A total of 169 patients were included in the study, 44% of which underwent DPR. Overall, patients who underwent DPR received a more frequent diagnosis of AFIs (28% vs. 13%, p = 0.012). After multi-variable adjustment, patients undergoing post-operative DPR had significantly higher odds of developing AFI (odds ratio [OR] = 5.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3-18.5). In hybrid-logit CART models, DPR was again identified as being associated with an increased likelihood of developing AFI (OR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.0-6.0). Conclusion: In this cohort, DPR patients had significantly higher chances of developing AFIs. This supports the need for further investigation into the clinical implications of AFIs in critically ill surgical patients and the need to develop risk mitigating strategies."

DCL incidence increased over time (OR = 1.07 [1.05-1.08], p < 0.001). Presence of pre-operative septic shock increased over the years (OR = 1.04 [1.01-1.07], p = 0.007). Mortality, readmission, and post-operative septic complications did not change over the study period. Average LOS significantly decreased over time (OR = 0.93 [0.92-0.95], p < 0.001). The odds of a surgeon using DCL increased by 7% each year. Although pre-operative septic shock incidence increased, LOS decreased over time while mortality remained unchanged."

    "abstract": "Shared decision-making (SDM) is now considered the gold standard approach to counselling and obtaining patient consent. Research into patient perceptions of SDM is lacking and barriers to its implementation remain, specifically in the time-pressurized, high-risk emergency general surgery (EGS) setting. The aim of this work was to explore what EGS patients understand about SDM, gaining insight into their perspectives and experiences to understand the potential barriers both clinicians and patients may face. This work consisted of two parts: part 1 was an initial scoping review to inform the development of part 2-a patient and public involvement (PPI) exercise. The scoping review determined the quantity and quality of research in this area enabling long-listing of known SDM concepts. This long-list developed questions and structured discussions for the PPI exercise. Responses were transcribed, then analysed using thematic analysis. The scoping review found limited evidence for both the implementation of SDM in EGS and patients' perspectives. Seven papers considered SDM in other settings that allowed long-listing of the values and concepts for the PPI exercise. Nine patients and four supporters were identified from an established EGS database. After open discussion of the values and SDM concepts, thematic analysis was performed that identified two key themes: patient perceptions of how surgeons make decisions, and patient experiences of EGS decision-making. Five subtheme analyses showed participants were not aware of surgeons' use of '30-day mortality' and could not quantify surgical risk, feeling time pressures and out of control. Almost all relied on surgeons to make their decision, valuing the surgeon's opinion over their own. With no previous reported evidence, this work provides the first patient insights into SDM in the EGS setting. With multiple barriers identified, further work is essential to increase implementation of this gold standard approach to patient consent."

    "abstract": "Morning postoperative labs are often obtained for emergency general surgery (EGS) patients. Studies in other surgical fields indicate that routine postoperative day 1 (POD1) labs are sometimes being performed excessively and do not require intervention. The purpose of this study is to identify predictors indicating the need for POD1 labs in EGS patients based on likelihood of intervention. This is a retrospective review of non-critically ill EGS patients from 2022 to 2023 who received POD1 morning labs. The odds of having an abnormal result and likelihood of intervention were measured through multivariate logistic regression accounting for patient characteristics and procedure. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis was performed to determine significant predictors of an abnormal result and intervention. 502 EGS patients were included. LASSO revealed that procedure duration, fever, lysis of adhesions, preoperative systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg, older age, heart failure, operative blood loss, chronic kidney disease, and anticoagulation use were independent predictors for any abnormal result (area under the receiver operation curve (AUC)=0.785). Independent predictors of intervention were procedure duration, older age, higher estimated blood loss (EBL), anticoagulant use, and lysis of adhesions (AUC=0.704). Procedures >400 min carried an 84.3% chance of an abnormal lab requiring intervention. EBL >200 mL carried a 75.5% chance of an abnormal lab requiring intervention. POD1 labs for non-critically ill EGS patient rarely require intervention and can be safely omitted. Labs should be considered for longer procedures, higher EBLs, older patients, those on anticoagulation, or after lysis of adhesions."

    "abstract": "Timely access to care is a key metric for health care systems and is particularly important in conditions that acutely worsen with delays in care, including surgical emergencies. However, the association between travel time to emergency care and risk for complex presentation is poorly understood. To evaluate the impact of travel time on disease complexity at presentation among people with emergency general surgery conditions and to evaluate whether travel time was associated with clinical outcomes and measures of increased health resource utilization. This retrospective cohort study used administrative statewide inpatient and emergency department databases with linkage across encounters, including nearly every inpatient or emergency department encounter in the states of Florida and California in 2021. Participants included adult patients who presented to an emergency department with 1 of 5 common emergency surgical conditions. Data were collected from January to December 2021 and analyzed from June to December 2023. The primary exposure was travel time from the patient's home to the facility where they initially received emergency care. The primary outcome of interest was surgical disease complexity at the time of presentation to emergency care. Secondary outcomes included inpatient complications, mortality, and indicators of health system resource utilization. Multivariable logistic regression models were used, and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% CIs were reported. Among 190 311 adults with emergency general surgery conditions, 7138 (3.8%) lived further than 60 minutes from the facility where they sought emergency care. Longer travel times were associated with higher odds of complex disease presentation for travel time of more than 120 minutes vs 15 minutes or less (aOR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.17-1.40). Patients with a travel time 60 minutes or more were more likely to require operative intervention (aOR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.10-1.26), inpatient admission (aOR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.33-1.50), interfacility transfer (aOR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.15-1.51), and longer inpatient stay (adjusted mean difference, 0.47 days; 95% CI, 0.35-0.59), and had higher charges (adjusted mean difference, $8284; 95% CI, $5532-$11 035). In this cohort study of patients with emergency surgical conditions, travel time to emergency care was associated with markers of delayed presentation and increased facility resource utilization. As opposed to static measures, such as rurality, travel time may serve as a more useful metric to inform policy efforts aimed at preserving access to care amidst rural hospital closures and regionalization."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), though rare, are associated with neurofibromatosis (NF) type 1 and may cause significant gastrointestinal bleeding. A 42-year-old male with NF1 presented with severe hematochezia and underwent initial non-contrast CT, which was negative for abnormalities. Subsequent endoscopies and PillCam studies also revealed no clear bleeding source. Due to persistent bleeding and hemodynamic instability, a contrast-enhanced CT was eventually performed, revealing a hyper-enhancing mass in the proximal ileum. Emergent surgical exploration identified a 1.5-cm jejunal GIST, which was resected successfully, stabilizing the patient who was discharged without the need for adjuvant therapy. This case highlights the importance of early contrast-enhanced imaging in NF1 patients presenting with acute bleeding to facilitate timely diagnosis, reduce hospital resource utilization, and avoid unnecessary invasive procedures."

    "abstract": "Trauma surgery is a fundamental aspect of medicine. According to the 2023 mortality report from Statistics Korea, external factors such as intentional self-harm and transportation incidents are leading causes of death among individuals aged 10 to 30, accounting for 7.9% of overall mortality. Despite advances in the field, specialization has hindered comprehensive trauma care. In South Korea, regional trauma centers have been established to meet critical trauma management needs; however, challenges remain, including a shortage of trauma surgeons and inefficient resource utilization. The reluctance of surgical residents to pursue trauma training exacerbates the scarcity of qualified specialists. Trauma surgeons often bear extensive responsibilities, which limits their ability to perform prompt interventions. Acute Care Surgery (ACS) offers a model to integrate trauma and non-trauma surgical care, enabling hospitals to implement effective protocols for urgent cases and improving patient outcomes. Research indicates that ACS enhances emergency surgical management, increases training opportunities for residents, and improves job satisfaction among participating surgeons. Integrating ACS into South Korea's healthcare system is essential to optimize resource allocation and improve emergency care, ultimately leading to enhanced public health outcomes."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to establish a scoring system for preoperative assessment of postoperative mortality in elderly patients undergoing emergency general surgery. A retrospectively database of geriatric emergency general surgery (EGS) patients who underwent emergency surgery was used for the development of the scoring system. In total, 1500 patients were enrolled with mean age of 69.8 years in the study. Through the development and comparison of models, we ultimately derived a rating scale known as GES (Geriatric Emergency Surgery Score). This score has a c-statistic of 0.892 for mortality (95% CI 0.854-0.931). The observed probability of mortality in hospital gradually increased from 1.1% at a score of 0 to 30.3% at a score of 5 and 100% at a score of 8. The GES scoring model in this study will accurately predict the mortality risk of elderly patients with acute abdomen, optimize the allocation of medical resources, and standardize the assessment of patients' conditions based on scientific criteria. Further prospective multicenter trials are needed to externally validate the model developed."

Limited knowledge of surgeons' approach to risk assessment is available. We investigated how Canadian surgeons approach PRA for EGS and their awareness of available RATs. Canadian Association of General Surgeons members were invited to complete an online cross-sectional survey. Descriptive statistics were reported. Of 278 respondents, 70% were attending surgeons (44% had 5-10 years in practice, 43% > 10 years), 5% fellows, and 25% residents. Most worked in medium-/large-volume centers (89%) and teaching hospitals (77%). During preoperative risk assessment, 2/3 of respondents reported applying clinical experience/instinct and referring to literature, while 55% used RATs. The best-known and used tools were the ACS-NSQIP calculator (68% and 59%) and the Emergency Surgery Acuity Score (ESAS, 66% and 47%, respectively). Surgeons were divided regarding the accuracy of RAT estimates, with 47% considering them generally accurate and 49% inaccurate. Trainees reported greater interest in major morbidity risk (86% vs. 65%) and probability of supported discharge (45% vs. 29%) than surgeons. Among participants not using RATs, 41% indicated they are scarcely accessible in the EGS context, while 33% found them cumbersome and time-consuming. RATs are underused in favor of personal judgment. The use of RATs may facilitate decision-making in elderly/complex patients and help reduce variability in practice, particularly for trainees and less-experienced surgeons. A greater effort in education is needed to spread the culture of RATs for PRA."

    "abstract": "While various factors leading to prolonged length of stay (LOS) have been identified for emergency general surgery (EGS), there is limited literature on specific factors for individual emergent specialties. This study aimed to identify patient factors and in-hospital complications associated with prolonged LOS for gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI-related EGS presentations in a low-resource setting. Data from 2010 to 2019 were retrieved from one of the largest tertiary care centers in Pakistan. We included adult patients (≥18 y) with index admissions for primary EGS conditions mapped to surgical areas defined by the American Association for Surgery of Trauma. Multivariable linear regression models were created to ascertain factors associated with prolonged LOS for 11 American Association for Surgery of Trauma -defined surgical areas. The mean age of 31,499 patients was 48.87 ± 16.82 y, where 23,198 (73.65%) patients underwent surgery. Undergoing emergency surgery was independently associated with increased LOS for all surgical areas (all P values < 0.05), except for hepatic-pancreatic-biliary. Sepsis and septic shock were the most common complications for both operated and nonoperated patients and were significantly associated with increased LOS for most of the surgical areas. For non-GI-related surgical areas, uninsured patients had significantly greater LOS for soft tissue conditions only (β: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.49, 1.21). Different specialties have different drivers for prolonged hospital stay in EGS. This underscores the need to identify and address patient factors and in-hospital complications early on, according to individual specialties. Specific strategies catered to these factors will optimize preoperative care and reduce complications, ultimately decreasing patients' stay after an EGS presentation."

This is a retrospective study of geriatric emergency general surgery (EGS) patients at a tertiary care facility between 2017 and 2018. Inclusion criteria were ≥ 65 years old and presented directly from home. Non-survivors or those admitted from a healthcare facility were excluded. The primary outcome was discharge to home versus post-acute care. Out of 577 patients, the median age was 74, and 36.9% were discharged to a post-acute care facility. Factors predicting discharge to post-acute care were: mobility aid use (1.92, [1.19-3.11], p = 0.008), cerebrovascular accident (4.67, [1.99-10.94], p < 0.001), delirium (11.06, [2.29-53.43], p = 0.003), pre-operative transfusion (2.39, [1.13-5.08], p = 0.023), fall history (3.74, [1.90-7.36], p < 0.001), AKI (5.42, [2.61-11.25], p < 0.001), and lack of capacity to consent (4.11, [2.10-8.02], p < 0.001). Non-operative management was protective against discharge to post-acute care (0.38, [0.24-0.60], p < 0.001).

Successful implementation, however, hinges on buy-in from local clinicians. We therefore assessed clinician support for a potential TFP in Uganda, considering perceived need, curricular recommendations, barriers, and motivating factors. After cognitive interviews with experts and questionnaire pilot testing, we cross-sectionally surveyed Ugandan consultants (general surgeons and procedural specialists involved in trauma care) and surgical residents at a tertiary, national referral hospital. Respondent percentages were calculated for multiple-choice answers, and we performed thematic analysis of free-text responses using a primarily inductive approach. Among 46 faculty (from 13 specialties) and 42 resident respondents, 86% supported a Ugandan TFP. Respondents recommended incorporating emergency general surgery (66%), critical care (84%), and international rotations (76%) into the curriculum. Severe resource and structural deficiencies (82%) and concern about governmental support for post-training employment and compensation (66%) were leading perceived barriers to TFP implementation. Most faculty felt a TFP would improve patient outcomes (93%), overall trainee education (77%), and clinical efficiency (68%). Free-text responses were consistent with survey themes, indicating acute awareness of current trauma system inadequacies and conviction that a TFP would reduce injury-related mortality. Ugandan clinicians who care for injured patients view a TFP as crucial to improving injury-related outcomes, despite known barriers. TFP implementation should incorporate curricular recommendations from this survey and address widespread concerns about financial and infrastructural support from the national government and local institutions."

    "abstract": "Given the high mortality and morbidity of emergency general surgery (EGS), designing and implementing effective quality assessment tools is imperative. Currently accepted EGS risk scores are limited by the need for manual extraction, which is time-intensive and costly. We developed an automated institutional electronic health record (EHR)-linked EGS registry that calculates a modified Emergency Surgery Score (mESS) and a modified Predictive OpTimal Trees in Emergency Surgery Risk (POTTER) score and demonstrated their use in benchmarking outcomes. The EHR-linked EGS registry was queried for patients undergoing emergent laparotomies from 2018 to 2023. Data captured included demographics, admission and discharge data, diagnoses, procedures, vitals, and laboratories. The mESS and modified POTTER (mPOTTER) were calculated based off previously defined variables, with estimation of subjective variables using diagnosis codes and other abstracted treatment variables. This was validated against ESS and the POTTER risk calculators by chart review. Observed versus expected (O:E) 30-day mortality and complication ratios were generated. The EGS registry captured 177 emergent laparotomies. There were 32 deaths (18%) and 79 complications (45%) within 30 days of surgery. For mortality, the mean difference between the mESS and ESS risk predictions for mortality was 3% (SD, 10%) with 86% of mESS predictions within 10% of ESS. The mean difference between the mPOTTER and POTTER was -2% (SD, 11%) with 76% of mPOTTER predictions within 10% of POTTER. Observed versus expected ratios by mESS and ESS were 1.45 and 1.86, respectively, and for mPOTTER and POTTER, they were 1.45 and 1.30, respectively. There was similarly good agreement between automated and manual risk scores in predicting complications. Our study highlights the effective implementation of an institutional EHR-linked EGS registry equipped to generate automated quality metrics. This demonstrates potential in enhancing the standardization and assessment of EGS care while mitigating the need for extensive human resources investment.

Surgeons must identify postoperative interventions to improve outcomes among older emergency general surgery (EGS) patients. The objective of this cohort study was to examine the association between early follow-up with a primary care physician (PCP) and the risk of nursing home acceptance or death in the year following EGS admission among older adults. Using population-based administrative health data in Ontario, Canada (2006-2016), we followed all older adults (65 years or older) for 1 year after hospital admission for EGS conditions. A multivariable Cox model was used to identify the association between early postdischarge follow-up with a patient's PCP and the time to nursing home acceptance or death while adjusting for confounders. Among 76,568 older EGS patients, 32,087 (41.9%) were seen by their usual PCP within 14 days of discharge, and 9,571 (12.5%) were accepted to a nursing home or died within 1 year. Primary care physician follow-up was associated with a 13% reduced risk of nursing home acceptance or death compared with no follow-up (hazard ratio 0.87; 95% confidence interval 0.84-0.91). This effect was consistent across age and frailty strata, patients managed operatively and nonoperatively, and patients who had both high and low baseline continuity of care with their PCP. Early follow-up with a familiar PCP was associated with a reduced risk of nursing home acceptance or death among older adults following EGS admission. Structures and processes of care are needed to ensure that such follow-up is routinely arranged at discharge. Therapeutic/Care Management; Level III."

This study aims to identify prognostic factors in patients with GIP treated within a standardized acute care surgery (ACS) framework. This single center retrospective cohort study analyzed patients diagnosed with GIP who underwent emergent surgery and were admitted to the intensive care unit between January 2013 and March 2023. Among 354 patients, the mortality was 11%, and 38% of survivors experienced significant complications (Clavien-Dindo class III or higher). Independent prognostic factors for mortality included initial sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores (at the time of admission or ACS activation), postoperative SOFA (p-SOFA) scores, and postoperative body temperatures. For morbidity, independent predictors were the extent of peritonitis, the open surgery, postoperative albumin levels, and p-SOFA scores. These factors showed significant predictive accuracy for patient outcomes, as evidenced by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The Random Forest model identified p-SOFA scores and postoperative albumin levels as the most significant predictors for both survival and complications, with feature importances of 40.46% and 36.61% for survival, and 39.97% and 37.28% for complications, respectively. Postoperative body temperature also played a moderately important role, contributing 14.63% to mortality and 15.9% to morbidity predictions. Patients with a p-SOFA score ≥ 7, postoperative albumin ≤ 2, and body temperature ≤ 36 °C, as well as those with a p-SOFA score ≥ 10, albumin ≤ 2.9, and body temperature ≤ 36 °C, had a 100% mortality rate. These factors are critical indicators for predicting patient outcomes. It is crucial to establish a system that ensures rapid preoperative work-up, accurate surgical intervention, and evidence-based postoperative critical care. Implementing such a system and assessing patient outcomes after surgery using the identified factors could provide a more detailed evaluation."

Demographic data (age, gender, and comorbidities), surgical diagnoses, and SHARP risk scores of the patients were evaluated. Also, 30-day mortality and length of stay in the emergency service and hospital were examined.ResultsA total of 386 patients were evaluated in this study. The mean age of these patients was 75 years (65-94). The most common cause of EGS was hernia. The cause with the highest mortality was intraabdominal perforations. The presence of malignancy and an increase in the number of comorbidities were associated with mortality. SHARP scores of 3, 4, and 5 were significantly associated with length of hospital stay and mortality.ConclusionWe recommend considering the SHARP risk score to predict mortality and length of hospital stay in geriatric EGS patients."

This study aimed to evaluate whether implementing the acute care surgery (ACS) system in Korea has improved the clinical outcomes of patients. This retrospective cohort study was conducted at three tertiary hospitals in Korea. The study included patients aged 18-99 years who required EGS due to acute abdomen or abdominal trauma. A window period of 4 months was set after the implementation of the ACS system, and the clinical outcomes before and after the implementation were compared. A total of 2146 patients were enrolled in the study, with 1008 in the pre-ACS group and 1138 in the post-ACS group. After propensity score matching, 901 patients were selected in the pre-ACS group and 906 patients were selected in the post-ACS group. The time from emergency room admission to operating room transfer was reduced in the post-ACS group, with a mean of 452.2 ± 347.0 min compared to 522.1 ± 416.5 min in the pre ACS group (P = 0.001). Moreover, the complication rates were reduced in the post-ACS group (38.3% vs. 31.3%, P = 0.006).

    "abstract": "Many patients undergoing emergency surgery are malnourished. Identifying malnutrition is a prerequisite to offering targeted nutritional support. Guidelines exist but little is known regarding exactly how surgeons identify malnutrition, or the barriers that influence surgeons' clinical decision-making. The aim of this work was to explore how consultant surgeons identify malnutrition in emergency general surgery (EGS) patients and the barriers to nutritional assessment and intervention. Consultant surgeons with emergency surgery duties were invited to participate. Semi-structured interviews were conducted online, audiovisually recorded and transcribed. An inductive approach was used for data analysis using the framework method. Coding and analysis were performed by two independent researchers using NVivo software. Themes were developed and reviewed with the supervising team. Interviews continued until data saturation was reached. Ethical approval was gained prior to interviews. Eighteen interviews were conducted across three hospital settings. Identification of malnutrition consisted of three themes: 'The surgeon' (knowledge, experience, planning ahead); 'The patient' (selection, composition, clinical progress, operative considerations); and 'The institution' (collaboration, extended surgical team). Three themes encompassed barriers experienced: 'The surgeon' (understanding, culture, ownership, time constraints); 'The institution' (provision, staffing, conflict, hospital setting); and 'The wider context' (research, external factors). These influenced clinical decision-making, which had two themes: 'To join or not to join' (risk taking, site of anastomosis) and 'Nutritional support' (timing, referral pathways). The identification and management of malnutrition in EGS is fraught with barriers, impacting operative and clinical decision-making. Improvements in surgeon education, culture, collaborative working and resources are needed."

    "abstract": "Traumatic injury remains a leading cause of death globally, necessitating rapid and accurate diagnostic tools in emergency settings. Whole-body computed tomography (WBCT) has emerged as an increasingly utilized component in trauma care due to its speed and diagnostic precision. This review summarizes current data on the impact of WBCT on trauma mortality and examines the frequency and clinical implications of incidental findings (IFs). PubMed/Medline was searched for randomized controlled trials (RCT) and meta-analyses in the context of WBCT's effect on trauma mortality as well as retrospective studies investigating the clinical impact of IF. Studies were excluded if they did not measure endpoints of mortality in relation to WBCT or the incidence and impact of IF in WBCT patients. Emergency Department (ED) length of stay (LOS) was significantly reduced by a mean of nine to 34 minutes in WBCT cohorts, with no significant change in hospital or intensive care unit LOS. Contrary to some previous analyses, survival benefit was not reproduced in an RCT in this context. IF were identified in 40-54.8% of WBCT trauma patients, with 29-69.2% of all findings detected on abdominal/pelvic scans. 5.8-31.3% of IF required urgent management. Follow-up on IF was often inadequate and approximately half of cases were omitted from discharge reports. WBCT potentially enhances trauma care through rapid diagnosis and reduced ED LOS. The lack of corroborating RCT evidence highlights the need for additional trials. Effective management of IF remains a critical area for improvement that may optimize patient outcomes. Institutions may benefit from developing guidelines to address the reporting and follow-up of IF in trauma patients."

    "abstract": "Graduate medical education (GME) lacks a standardized military training program for general surgery residents, and concern exists that they may not be prepared to serve as combat surgeons on training completion. The purpose of this study was to assess military surgery trainee satisfaction with their programs. Our hypothesis was that military residents were not completely confident to care for combat casualties on completion of current GME training. We surveyed US Army, Navy, and Air Force general surgery residents and fellows between November 2023 and March 2024 to assess their confidence in managing combat injuries. Queried residents further rate their overall satisfaction with surgical training, perceived level of deployment preparedness and curriculum elements which they thought would be most beneficial to their training. The survey yielded an overall 43% response rate (132/305) with a response rate of 42% (61/147) from the Army, 56% (44/79) from the Navy, and 34% (27/79) from the Air Force. Most trainees were trained in military medical treatment facility residency programs (n=91, 68.9%) and nearly half of respondents (n=64, 49%) were senior trainees (postgraduate year (PGY)4, PGY5, and fellows). Among all trainees, only two-thirds (n=88, 67%,) thought they were adequately prepared to deploy and operate on military combat casualties by the end of residency but 114 (86%) were satisfied with the training they received during general surgery residency in adult trauma, 103 (78%) in critical care, and 112 (85%) in acute care surgery. However, more than half were unsatisfied with the training they received in obstetric/gynecologic and urologic emergencies (n=72, 55%; and n=67, 51%, respectively). Although the majority of military surgical residents surveyed are satisfied with their training in adult trauma, critical care, and emergency general surgery, a large number of trainees thought they would not be ready to deploy and manage combat casualties.

    "title": "Agile monitoring dashboard for clinical research studies.",
    "abstract": "Clinical trial success hinges on efficient participant recruitment and retention. However, slow accrual and attrition frequently hinder progress. To address these challenges, a novel dashboard tool with control charts has been developed to provide investigators on the multi-site study of Delirium and Neuropsychological Recovery among Emergency General Surgery Survivors (DANE study) with timely information to improve trial recruitment. A quality monitoring Excel dashboard with control chart functionality developed by the principal investigator's (PI) group and implemented in a department of a large hospital was re-engineered for research study recruitment purposes. The dashboard provides the PIs and other stakeholders with timely, actionable, and unbiased information on the count of participants who have completed each stage or action within the process, the rates of completion and trends, both for the current week and cumulatively. The DANE dashboard was prototyped using Microsoft Excel for accessibility and rapid development. The tool integrates with a REDCap database, simplifying data import and analysis. By facilitating informed decision-making throughout the recruitment process, the DANE dashboard has significantly enhanced clinical trial efficiency and led to changes in the eligibility criteria and improvements in the approach and consent processes. The DANE dashboard for monitoring participant recruitment and attrition in research studies represents a significant step towards enhancing study management and decision-making processes. It can be adapted to other clinical studies and other staged processes with attrition. The generic version, currently under development, holds promise for evolving into a valuable simulator by incorporating a spreadsheet for generating random data and accounting for resource constraints. This enhancement could further be augmented by integrating forecasting capabilities into the control charts. The Delirium and Neuropsychological Recovery among Emergency General Surgery Survivors (DANE) study (NCT05373017, 1R01AG076489-01) is a multi-site, two-arm, single-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of the Emergency General Surgery (EGS) Delirium Recovery Model to improve the cognitive, physical, and psychological recovery of EGS delirium survivors over 65. The DANE study received approval from the University of Wisconsin-Madison/University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics Institutional Review Board (IRB, no. 2022-0545, approval date September 14, 2022), and Indiana University agreed to cede IRB review to University of Wisconsin-Madison/University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics (September 29, 2022)."

    "abstract": "Background: Percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) rates have substantially increased in England over the past two decades. However, its utilization and clinical outcomes at a local level are not well documented or understood. This study aimed to characterize the cohort of patients who underwent PC and resulting clinical outcomes at a tertiary center for hepatobiliary and emergency general surgery. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients treated between 2012 and 2020 at a single center. A subgroup analysis was conducted to compare outcomes between Tokyo grade 2 and Tokyo grade 3 patients. Results: In the 73-patient cohort, a 57.1% increase in PC was observed between 2012 and 2020. Compared to the gold-standard Tokyo guidelines, 36 patients (49.3%) met the criteria for PC. Postprocedural complications occurred in 50 patients (68.5%), including PC tube dysfunction (27.4%), intra-abdominal abscess (20.5%), external bile leak (8.2%), and biloma (5.5%). Recurrent biliary infection developed in 30 patients (41.1%). Twenty-seven patients (37%) underwent emergency reinterventions due to acute cholecystitis recurrence. Twenty patients (27.4%) required radiological reintervention. Seven patients (9.6%) required emergency cholecystectomy, and ten patients (13.7%) underwent an elective cholecystectomy. Overall, 36 patients (49.3%) died during the follow-up period. Five patients (6.8%) died during index admission. Subgroup analysis demonstrated a higher rate of complications in the Tokyo grade 3 subgroup of 82.8% vs. 59.1% (P = .04). Patients from this subgroup were also more likely to require emergency additional abscess drainage (17.2% vs. 2.3%, P = .034). There was no significant difference in the number of emergency cholecystectomies performed between groups. Patients from the Tokyo grade 2 subgroup were more likely to have an elective cholecystectomy in the future (20.5% vs. 3.4%, P = .044). Conclusions: PC was overperformed in our patient cohort, and was associated with high postprocedure morbidity and mortality. Clinicians should be discerning in patient selection criteria for PC."

    "abstract": "Introduction Patient consent for surgery is a vital part of the surgical pathway from both a patient safety and medicolegal point of view. Improvement in documenting the full consent process in the electronic patient record (EPR), alongside the standard completion of the paper consent form in a surgical emergency unit (SEU), to comply with the Montgomery ruling of informed consent, has become of paramount importance. The aim of this project was to improve the documentation of the full consent process by creating an electronic template that was easy for the consenting clinician to use and provided a robust record of the bespoke consent process for the individual patient. Methods In July 2020, clinicians in the SEU were asked to begin documenting the patient's consent process in the EPR. The number of documented electronic consent processes (ECPs) of patients who underwent emergency general surgery during a two-week period was then captured between October and November 2020. The second cycle involved creating a single consent template, allowing the ECP to be easily documented in one template for all the common emergency surgery operations. All clinicians who were responsible for surgical consenting were asked to use the electronic template as part of the consent process. The rate of electronic consent was recorded over a second two-week period, six months later, in May 2021. Results From the first cycle, 78 patients were identified as undergoing emergency surgery, of which 13% (N=10) had an electronic entry regarding the consent process fully documented and personalised to the patient. From the second cycle, 64 patients were identified. The rate of documented ECPs increased to 77% (N=49). Conclusion This project has successfully improved the electronic demonstration of a consent process, bespoke to the individual, in accordance with the Montgomery ruling, by implementing an easy-to-use template on EPR. This is a significant step towards full digital consent in the future."

    "abstract": "The optimal level of resident autonomy in emergency colorectal surgery is unclear. This study assessed perioperative outcomes in patients undergoing emergency colectomy with end stoma based on the presence of an attending surgeon. A retrospective analysis was conducted at a tertiary teaching hospital, including 360 patients who underwent emergency colectomy with end stoma between 2013 and 2023. The primary outcome was perioperative complications, including mortality. Of the 360 patients, 36 (10 ​%) had surgery without an attending surgeon present. Baseline characteristics such as age (p ​= ​0.34), Charlson Comorbidity Index (p ​= ​0.313), and sex (p ​= ​0.598) were similar across groups. Perioperative outcomes showed no significant differences in major complications (Clavien-Dindo ≥3, p ​= ​0.176), 90-day complication rate (p ​= ​0.698), or 90-day mortality (p ​= ​0.389). Malignancy-related cases also did not differ in lymph node yield (p ​= ​0.685) or overall survival (log-rank p ​= ​0.574). In this study, Hartmann resections performed by resident teams were not associated with worse perioperative or oncologic outcomes, suggesting that resident autonomy can be safely increased without compromising patient safety."

    "abstract": "Clostridium sordellii (C sordellii) is a gram positive, anaerobic bacterium that causes severe, often fatal infections. Classically, C sordellii infection is described as a high mortality process for women of childbearing age. We examined C sordellii infections in our hospital to determine if there have been any changes in prevalence, treatment, or outcome. We performed a query review of all patients with positive cultures for any type of Clostridium from 2007 to 2022. Individual charts were then reviewed for culture data. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics, while comparison between the patients that lived compared to those who died was analyzed using a student's t-test. A total of 15 patients had culture results positive for C sordellii. Interestingly, five patients had a C sordellii microbiology result without clinical evidence of soft tissue infection, suggesting colonization. Of the remaining ten patients with soft tissue infections, eight (80%) had a known history of intravenous drug use. All four patients who died presented with hypotension and markedly elevated WBCs. All four who died had a known history of intravenous drug use. To date, we believe this is the largest case series of C sordellii infections at a single institution. Our findings suggest that C sordellii may be more common in the environment that previously reported. Determining what makes this bacterium deadly to some, but not to others, requires further research. We must remain vigilant in evaluation of C sordellii infections to improve patient survival."

    "abstract": "Emergency surgical admissions represent the most unwell patients admitted to any hospital. Frailty and body composition independently identify risk of adverse outcomes but are seldom combined to predict outcomes in emergency patients. We aim to determine the relationships between frailty, body composition analyses (BCA) and mortality in an undifferentiated emergency general surgical patient population. A prospective, multicentre observational cohort study of patients admitted with emergency surgical pathology was conducted in eight hospitals. BCA were performed at L3 vertebrae using computed tomography images to quantify sarcopenia and myosteatosis. Sex-specific BCA cut-off values were determined by our previous study. Reported Edmonton Frail Scale (REFS) values ≥8 identified frailty. The primary outcomes were all-cause 30-day and 1-year mortality. Multivariable logistic regression was utilised to explore predictive relationships between frailty, BCA, mortality and independent discharge. A total of 194 patients were included; 24% were frail, 25% were sarcopenic and 23% myosteatotic. Some 61% of patients underwent an emergency laparotomy. Frail patients were more likely to be sarcopenic (20.4% vs 40.4%; p = 0.011) and myosteatotic (27.2% vs 51.1%; p = 0.004). Thirty-day and 1-year mortality was 5.2% and 15.5%, respectively; 30-day mortality was two times higher in the frail group (4.1% vs 8.5%; p = 0.414), and three times higher at 1 year (10.2% vs 31.9%; p = 0.001). Age (odds ratio [OR] 1.06; p = 0.001), sarcopenia (OR 2.88; p = 0.047) and frailty (OR 4.13; p = 0.001) were associated with 1-year mortality. Only 55.3% of frail patients were discharged home independently compared with 88.4% non-frail patients (p < 0.001). One-year mortality was greater in those with frailty and/or BCA abnormalities than in those without (28.8% vs 9.6%; p = 0.003).

    "abstract": "Emergency General Surgery (EGS) represent a wide spectrum of diseases with high complication and mortality rates. Race, insurance, and socioeconomic status have been associated with mortality in EGS patients. Acute care surgery (ACS) models have previously shown improved outcomes for EGS patients. We hypothesized that transition to an ACS model would increase access to care for underserved and higher risk EGS patients in a community hospital, without a change in mortality. This retrospective cohort study included adult EGS patients from 2017 to 2021 with current procedural terminology (CPT) codes of colectomy, small-bowel resection, peptic-ulcer surgery, appendectomy, or cholecystectomy. In July 2020, the hospital transitioned from a traditional model to an ACS model. Patients were analyzed for 42-month before (pre-ACS) and 18-month after (post-ACS) transition. Primary outcome was mortality; secondary outcomes were 30-day postoperative emergency department visits and readmission. We analyzed 467 pre-ACS and 238 post-ACS patients. After transition, patients were more likely to be Black, older, self-pay, and have higher Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI) scores. Rates of cholecystectomies increased and appendectomies decreased after transition. Adjusting for age, race, and ECI, there were no changes in 30-day all-cause mortality (0.9% versus 2.1%, P = 0.63), length of stay (2.7-days versus 3-days, P = 0.91) and rate of postop emergency department visits (7.5% versus 11.3%, P = 0.16). There was a significant increase in hospital readmission after the ACS transition (5.1 versus 10.5%, P = 0.001, odds ratio 5.3). After implementation of an ACS model, we found an increase in EGS patients who were older, Black, underinsured, with higher ECI without change in mortality. Implementation of ACS models at community hospitals may increase access to quality care for underserved and higher risk patient populations."

    "abstract": "We sought to determine if there was a relationship between skin management and surgical site infections (SSIs) among patients undergoing a laparotomy for emergency general surgery (EGS). We hypothesize that skin closure technique is not associated with SSI. We performed a retrospective review of adult patients (>18 y) who underwent an exploratory laparotomy for EGS conditions within 6 h of surgical consultation from 2015 to 2019. Patients whose fascia was not closed during the index operation were excluded. Patients were divided into groups: open skin (OS) and closed skin (CS). OS included negative pressure wound therapy or wet-to-dry gauze; CS included closure with staples or sutures. Our primary outcome was the rate of SSI. The cohort comprised 388 patients: 42.3% OS (n = 164) and 57.7% CS (n = 224). The OS group had greater rates of systemic inflammatory response syndrome [SIRS] (54.9% versus 27.7%, P < 0.0001), hollow viscus perforation [HVP] (71.3% versus 20.5%, P < 0.0001), and peritoneal drains (51.2% versus 17.9%, P < 0.0001). Rates of OS management increased as wound class severity increased (0% [I] versus 12.2% [II] versus 15.9% [III] versus 72% [IV], P < 0.0001). The SSI rate for the cohort was 3.6% (n = 14); there was no difference in SSI rates (2.7% versus 4.9%, P = 0.3) between the CS or OS groups. Median length of stay was longer for the OS group (10 d versus 6.5 d, P < 0.0001). Independent predictors of OS management were SIRS (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-2.93, P = 0.04), HVP (aOR 2.03, 95% CI 1.09-3.8, P = 0.03), and class III/IV wounds (aOR 8.65, 95% CI 4.43-16.89, P < 0.0001). OS management occurs more often in patients with SIRS, HVP, and dirty wounds after EGS laparotomies. However, we found no difference in SSI between groups, suggesting that skin closure can be considered in contaminated or dirty wounds."

    "abstract": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with ultrasonic dissection presents a compelling alternative to conventional electrocautery. The evidence for elective cholecystectomy supports the adoption of ultrasonic dissection, citing advantages such as reduced operating time, diminished bleeding, shorter hospital stays and decreased postoperative pain and nausea. However, the efficacy of this procedure in emergency surgery and patients diagnosed with acute cholecystitis remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to compare outcomes of electrocautery and ultrasonic dissection in patients with acute cholecystitis. A randomized, parallel, double-blinded, multicentre controlled trial was conducted across eight Swedish hospitals. Eligible participants were individuals aged ≥ 18 years with acute cholecystitis lasting ≤ 7 days. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in the emergency setting as soon as local circumstances permitted. Random allocation to electrocautery or ultrasonic dissection was performed in a 1:1 ratio. The primary endpoint was the total complication rate, analysed using an intention-to-treat approach. The primary outcome was analysed using logistic generalized estimated equations. Patients, postoperative caregivers, and follow-up personnel were blinded to group assignment. From September 2019 to March 2023, 300 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to electrocautery dissection (n = 148) and ultrasonic dissection (n = 152). No significant difference in complication rate was observed between the groups (risk difference [RD] 1.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI], - 7.2% to 10.4%, P = 0.720). No significant disparities in operating time, conversion rate, hospital stay or readmission rates between the groups were noted. Haemostatic agents were more frequently used in electrocautery dissection (RD 10.6%, 95% CI, 1.3% to 19.8%, P = 0.025). Ultrasonic dissection and electrocautery dissection demonstrate comparable risks for complications in emergency surgery for patients with acute cholecystitis. Ultrasonic dissection is a viable alternative to electrocautery dissection or can be used as a complementary method in laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. The trial was registered prior to conducting the research on http://clinical. gov , NCT03014817."

    "abstract": "Over the past 3 years, approximately 23,000 emergency surgeries were performed annually in South Korea, accounting for >1% of all surgeries nationwide. With the growing necessity for treating these emergency cases with dedication and proficiency, acute care surgery (ACS) teams were appointed at various hospitals. Regarding the implications of the ACS team, many studies showed promising results with a shorter time from the emergency department (ED) to the operating room (OR), shorter length of stay, and fewer complications. This study aimed to demonstrate the overall effect of ACS implementation at a single institution in South Korea. This was a single-center, retrospective observational study. Patients aged >18 years who visited the emergency room and received emergency surgery between July 2014 and December 2016 (pre-ACS) and between July 2017 and December 2019 (post-ACS) were included. Among 958 patients, 497 were in the pre-ACS group and 461 in the post-ACS group. After propensity score matching by age, sex, underlying disease, and Emergency Surgery Acuity Score, 405 patients remained in each group. Our analysis showed a reduction in time from ED presentation to operation (547.8 ± 401.0 minutes vs. 476.6 ± 313.2 minutes, P = 0.005) and complication rates (24.7% vs. 16.8%, P < 0.001) in the post-ACS group. There were no significant differences in total operation duration, length of hospital stay, and mortality between the groups. As expected, time from ED to OR and complication rates were significantly reduced in the post-ACS group. Implementing an ACS team dedicated to emergency surgery provides better clinical outcomes."

Following ACS implementation at our institution, we developed a perioperative clinical pathway for acute appendicitis (AA) to improve efficiency and standardize post-operative care. The purpose of our study is to assess patient outcomes utilizing our ACS clinical pathway for patients with AA. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study involving patients admitted to our tertiary care facility with AA who underwent appendectomy. Patients were classified by pre-implementation (January 1, 2016-July 31, 2018) and post-implementation (August 1, 2018-December 31, 2020) of our ACS clinical pathway. The primary outcome was hospital length of stay (LOS). Statistical analysis was performed using SAS with a p-value <0.05 determined as significant. Results: Of the 492 patients included, 225 were in the pre- and 267 were in the post-implementation cohorts. Hospital LOS was substantially decreased in the post-implementation cohort (31.2 vs. 50.4 h, p < 0.001). The post-implementation group had a substantial decrease in computed tomography (CT) to operating room (OR) start time (6.81 vs. 11.4 h, p < 0.001), CT to antibiotic agents' administration (2.20 vs. 3.37 h, p < 0.001), inpatient opioid utilization (125 morphine equivalents [ME] vs. 172 ME, p < 0.001), and discharge antibiotic agents' prescription rates (23.6% vs. 30.7%, p = 0.077). Recovery unit discharges (20 vs. 9%, p < 0.001) were increased in the post-implementation cohort. Conclusion: Our ACS clinical pathway for AA resulted in earlier surgical intervention, enhanced opioid and antimicrobial stewardship, and gains in surgical care efficiencies."

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has primarily been characterized by respiratory symptoms, but emerging evidence suggests multi-organ involvement, including the gastrointestinal tract. This case report aims to highlight colon perforation as a rare but significant complication in COVID-19 patients. We present two cases of male patients, aged 38 and 33, who were admitted with severe COVID-19 symptoms and required intubation and ventilator support. Both patients developed abdominal distension during their ICU stay, prompting surgical consultations. In the first case, a 38-year-old male developed septic shock and abdominal distension on day 29 of his hospital stay. An exploratory laparotomy revealed a 2 mm perforation in the sigmoid colon, which was managed with Hartmann's procedure. In the second case, a 33-year-old male developed abdominal distension one week post-admission. An exploratory laparotomy revealed a 2 mm perforation in the mid-transverse colon, managed initially with a primary two-layer repair and later with a transverse loop colostomy due to additional perforations. These cases emphasize the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for gastrointestinal complications, such as colon perforation, in COVID-19 patients. Early diagnosis and surgical intervention are crucial for managing this life-threatening complication. Further research is needed to understand the incidence and underlying mechanisms of colon perforation in COVID-19 patients."

    "abstract": "Risk factors for in-hospital mortality related to gastrointestinal complications requiring operative intervention after cardiovascular surgery have not been previously described. Adult patients who underwent cardiovascular surgery followed by gastrointestinal surgery during the same admission between January 2010 and June 2023 were included. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to assess overall survival based on identified risk factors. Gastrointestinal complications requiring operative intervention after cardiac surgery occurred in 151 patients, with an overall in-hospital mortality of 35.76% (n = 54). The most common diagnosis was bowel ischemia (50.33%). On multivariable logistic regression, the history of cirrhosis (odds ratio: 37.96, 95% confidence interval: 3.57-543.90) and the clinical condition at the time of emergency general surgery consultation, described by elevated lactate (odds ratio: 5.76, 95% confidence interval: 1.71-22.82), platelets <50 × 109/L (odds ratio: 11.34, 95% confidence interval: 1.60-162.37), ≥3 vasoactive medications (odds ratio: 4.93, 95% CI: 1.29-20.14), and the need for renal replacement therapy (odds ratio: 5.18, 95% confidence interval: 1.46-20.79) were predictive of in-hospital mortality. In-hospital mortality was low when none of the risk factors identified on multivariable analysis were present (2.38%, n = 1 of 42), but in-hospital mortality was universal among patients with 4-5 risk factors (100%, n = 8 of 8). Gastrointestinal complications after cardiac surgery are disastrous when patient illness becomes severe. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for gastrointestinal complications to promote early involvement of general surgery. Knowledge of these risk factors could help guide discussions among the multidisciplinary care team, patients, and their families."

Patients undergoing an emergency exploratory laparotomy for nontrauma indications at 2 academic medical centers between June 2020 and March 2022 were included. POTTER preoperative risk calculations and postoperative outcomes were systematically recorded. POTTER's performance in predicting 30-day postoperative mortality, septic shock, respiratory failure, bleeding, and pneumonia was assessed using the c-statistic methodology. A total of 361 patients were included. The median age was 63 years (interquartile range 51 to 72 years), 45.4% were women, and the overall mortality and morbidity were 24.1% and 51.4%, respectively. POTTER predicted mortality accurately with a c-statistic of 0.90. POTTER also accurately predicted the occurrence of individual postoperative complications, with c-statistics ranging between 0.80 and 0.89. This is the first prospective validation of the artificial intelligence-enabled POTTER calculator. The superior accuracy, user-friendliness, and interpretability of POTTER make it a useful bedside tool for preoperative patient and family counseling."

    "title": "Inguinal Hernia With Gastric Content.",
    "abstract": "It is incredibly rare to find stomach content inside an inguinal hernia. Here, we report a 77-year-old male patient with a long-standing history of a left inguinal hernia spanning over a decade. Notably, the hernia had become irreducible for the past 20 days. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a substantial left inguinal hernia extending into the left scrotal region causing bowel obstruction. The hernial neck measured approximately 5.5 cm in transverse diameter. Protrusion through this defect included the stomach, small and large bowel loops, and free mesenteric fat and vessels into the hernial sac. The patient underwent a life-saving exploratory laparotomy and the hernial sac was reduced and repaired. In conclusion, inguinal hernias are common, but stomach content cases are extremely rare and they usually present with gastric outlet obstruction or gastric perforation. CT is recommended to visualize the stomach within the hernia and to exclude complications. Surgical repair is usually the management of choice."

    "abstract": "Retained rectal foreign bodies (RFBs) of an autoerotic nature represent an emerging and rare surgical emergency, posing a sensitive challenge for surgeons. RFBs exhibit a wide range of presentations and require varied management approaches, with the choice of treatment modality differing from case to case. Recently, minimally invasive techniques have been employed for the retrieval of RFBs. In 2021, the World Society of Emergency Surgery and the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma released guidelines on anorectal emergencies, highlighting the usefulness of these techniques as adjunctive tools for both diagnosis and ruling out associated complications. In this report, we describe two noteworthy cases of men who presented to the trauma emergency department with foreign bodies lodged in their rectums. We also highlight the potential role of minimally invasive techniques within a \"step-up\" approach for the management of retained RFBs."

    "abstract": "Addressing disparities is crucial for enhancing population health, ensuring health security, and fostering resilient health systems. Disparities in acute care surgery (trauma, emergency general surgery, and surgical critical care) have been well documented and the magnitude of inequities demand an intentional, organized, and effective response. As part of its commitment to achieve high-quality, equitable care in all aspects of acute care surgery, the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma convened an expert panel at its eigty-second annual meeting in September 2023 to discuss how to take action to work towards health equity in acute care surgery practice. The panel discussion framed contemporary disparities in the context of historic and political injustices, then identified targets for interventions and potential action items in health system structure, health policy, the surgical workforce, institutional operations and quality efforts. We offer a four-pronged approach to address health inequities: identify, reduce, eliminate, and heal disparities, with the goal of building a healthcare system that achieves equity and justice for all."

    "abstract": "Since current fascial traction methods involve invasive procedures, they are generally employed late in the management of the open abdomen (OA). This study aimed to evaluate early versus late placement of a non-invasive, pressure-regulated device for fascial reapproximation and gap reduction in OA patients. The study included all patients who had the abdominal fascia intentionally left open after damage control operation for trauma and emergency general surgery and were managed with the device in an academic hospital between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2023. Time of device placement in relation to the end of index laparotomy was defined as early (≤24 hours) versus late (>24 hours). Time-related mid-incisional width reduction of the fascial gap and fascial closure were assessed using descriptive and linear regression analysis. There was a significantly higher percent reduction in the fascial gap at the midpoint of the laparotomies in the early (≤24 hours) AbClo placement group compared with the late (>24 hours) AbClo placement group, respectively, median 76% versus 43%, p<0.001. Linear regression adjusting for body mass index and the number of takebacks indicated that fascial approximation was 22% higher for early placement (β=0.22; CI 0.12, 0.33, p<0.001). Primary myofascial closure rate with early (≤24 hours) application of the device was 98% versus 85% with late application. Early non-invasive application of the device (≤24 hours) after the initial laparotomy resulted in greater reduction of the fascial gap and higher primary fascial closure rate compared with late placement (>24 hours). Early non-invasive intervention could prevent abdominal wall myofascial retraction in OA patients. IV."

    "abstract": "There is growing interest in developing coordinated regional systems for nontraumatic surgical emergencies; however, our understanding of existing emergency general surgery (EGS) care communities is limited. To apply network analysis methods to delineate EGS care regions and compare the performance of this method with the Dartmouth Health Referral Regions (HRRs). This cross-sectional study was conducted using the 2019 California and New York state emergency department and inpatient databases. Eligible participants included all adult patients with a nonelective admission for common EGS conditions. Interhospital transfers (IHTs) were identified by transfer indicators or temporally adjacent hospitalizations at 2 different facilities. Data analysis was conducted from January to May 2024. Admission for primary EGS diagnosis. Regional EGS networks (RENs) were delineated by modularity optimization (MO), a community detection method, and compared with the plurality-based Dartmouth HRRs. Geographic boundaries were compared through visualization of patient flows and associated health care regions. Spatial accuracy of the 2 methods was compared using 6 common network analysis measures: localization index (LI), market share index (MSI), net patient flow, connectivity, compactness, and modularity. A total of 1 244 868 participants (median [IQR] age, 55 [37-70 years]; 776 725 male [62.40%]) were admitted with a primary EGS diagnosis. In New York, there were 405 493 EGS encounters with 3212 IHTs (0.79%), and 9 RENs were detected using MO compared with 10 Dartmouth HRRs. In California, there were 839 375 encounters with 10 037 IHTs (1.20%), and 14 RENs were detected compared with 24 HRRs. The greatest discrepancy between REN and HRR boundaries was in rural regions where one REN often encompassed multiple HRRs. The MO method was significantly better than HRRs in identifying care networks that accurately captured patients living within the geographic region as indicated by the LI and MSI for New York (mean [SD] LI, 0.86 [1.00] for REN vs 0.74 [1.00] for HRR; mean [SD] MSI, 0.16 [0.13] for REN vs 0.32 [0.21] for HRR) and California (mean [SD] LI, 0.83 [1.00] for REN vs 0.74 [1.00] for HRR; mean [SD] MSI, 0.19 [0.14] for REN vs 0.39 [0.43] for HRR). Nearly 27% of New York hospitals (37 of 139 hospitals [26.62%]) and 15% of California hospitals (48 of 336 hospitals [14.29%]) were reclassified into a different community with the MO method. Development of optimal health delivery systems for EGS patients will require knowledge of care patterns specific to this population. The findings of this cross-sectional study suggest that network science methods, such as MO, offer opportunities to identify empirical EGS care regions that outperform HRRs and can be applied in the development of coordinated regional systems of care."

    "title": "Rise of the robots: implementing robotic surgery into the acute care surgery practice.",
    "abstract": "Acute Care Surgery (ACS) admissions and procedures are substantially increasing. ACS disproportionally accounts for a majority of morbidity and mortality among surgical patients. Minimally invasive techniques are associated with improved outcomes and shorter hospital length of stay within the ACS population. While laparoscopy is widespread, ACS surgeons have been slower to adopt the use of robotics. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of incorporating robotic surgery within ACS practice. Robotic General Surgery operations performed by 8 Acute Care Surgeons from 5 local facilities within a large integrated healthcare system were queried over a 15 month period. Patients who underwent emergent, urgent, sub-acute, and elective robotic operations by ACS staff were identified. Demographics collected included age, gender, BMI, and ASA score. Outcomes recorded included procedure classification, total supply and implant charges (TSI), conversion to open, hospital length of stay (LOS), 30 day readmission, and 30 day mortality. Of 200 operations, the most common were Cholecystectomy (43.5%), Inguinal hernia repair (26.0%), Ventral hernia repair (18.0%), Appendectomy (5.0%), and Sigmoid Colectomy (3.5%). The median (± std dev) age was 48 ± 16.66 years and BMI was 29.9 ± 8.79 kg/m2. 46% of cases were sub-acute (n = 92), 33.5% were elective (n = 67), 14% were emergent (n = 28), and 6.5% were urgent (n = 13). Most patients were ASA 2 (107, 46.1%) or ASA 3 (71, 45.9%). The median (IQR) TSI and LOS were $1,770 (889.50) USD and 0.1 (0.9) days. Forty-one inpatient procedures were performed. Median LOS was 3 days and expected LOS was 3.1 days (O:E = 0.96). Five patients were readmitted within 30 days, and there were no deaths within 30 days. Robotic techniques may be safely implemented by ACS surgeons, potentially benefitting both patient and surgeon. LOS was similar between laparoscopic and robotic cases and only two cases required conversion to an open procedure. Next steps include a multi-center prospective trial comparing robotic to laparoscopic cases."

We implemented a new General Surgery/General Medicine care model, for all emergency General Surgery patients aged 75 years and older. We compared rates of goals of care (GOC) documentation, hospital-acquired complications (HAC), mortality, and hospital length of stay (LOS). This is a non-randomized trial, with data collected prospectively in phase 1 (2021-2022), where patients received the traditional standard of care (case-by-case referral to a General Physician), and in phase 2 (2022-2023) where patients received integrated care. Variables were compared between phase 1 and phase 2 using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). Five hundred and forty-nine patients, 188 in phase 1 and 361 in phase 2, participated in the study. On univariate analysis, there was a significant increase in patients treated non-surgically in phase 2 (58.5% vs. 69.0%). Patients treated non-surgically had significantly shorter LOS, experienced less HACs (P < 0.001). Other variables did not significantly differ after implementation of the service. The multivariate GLM revealed a significant reduction in admissions with undocumented GOC in phase 2 (P = 0.037). This study showed that an integrated care model resulted in a greater proportion of patients being treated non-surgically with a comparable rate of HAC and mortality, as well as better documentation of patients' GOC. As the number of older surgical patients will continue to rise, the call for such service to become standard of care in non-orthopaedic surgery is pressing."

    "abstract": "Richter's hernia is a rare but serious surgical emergency involving the entrapment or strangulation of part of the bowel's circumference in the hernial orifice, often without causing complete luminal obstruction. This case report describes a man in his 70s presenting with a 3-day history of abdominal pain and vomiting, despite normal bowel movements. Blood results revealed raised inflammatory markers, and computed tomography imaging suggested small bowel obstruction due to an incarcerated left inguinal hernia. Emergency surgery confirmed a Richter's hernia with a strangulated but viable bowel loop. Early surgical intervention led to a positive outcome. This case underscores the importance of high suspicion, early referral, and timely imaging in managing Richter's hernia to prevent severe complications, such as gangrene and perforation. Despite the absence of obstructive symptoms, early surgical intervention is critical when there is clinical concern regarding strangulation."

    "abstract": "Acute diverticulitis represents a common colorectal emergency seen in the Western world. Over time, management of this condition has evolved. This review aims to highlight recent evidence and update current recommendations. Notable evidence has emerged in certain aspects of diverticulitis. This includes disease pathogenesis, as emerging data suggest a potentially greater role for the microbiome and genetic predisposition than previously thought. Acute management has also seen major shifts, where traditional antibiotic treatment may no longer be necessary for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Following successful medical management of acute diverticulitis, indications for elective sigmoidectomy have decreased. The benefit of emergency surgery remains for peritonitis, sepsis, obstruction, and acute diverticulitis in certain immunocompromised patients. Routine colonoscopy, once recommended after all acute diverticulitis episodes, has been shown to be beneficial for cancer exclusion in a distinct patient population. Despite advances in research, certain entities remain poorly understood, such as smoldering diverticulitis and symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease. As research in the field expands, paradigm shifts will shape our understanding of diverticulitis, influencing how clinicians approach management and educate patients."

    "abstract": "Patients undergoing active cancer therapy or with metastatic cancer are at increased risk for acute cholecystitis and often present to general surgeons for evaluation and management. There is a paucity of data regarding the treatment processes used in these patients and the clinical outcomes achieved. Optimal management of acute cholecystitis in patients with cancer requires understanding their unique risk profile and options for treatment. Emergency general surgery data were collected at 10 hospitals from July 1, 2019, to February 29, 2024. Patients presenting with acute cholecystitis were selected for analysis. Propensity score matching was used to create matched cohorts of patients by the presence or absence of an active malignancy. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included complications, length of stay, readmission, and discharge disposition. Processes investigated include treatment modality, time to operation, and surgical technique. The analysis included 8,673 patients. Mean age was 53.2 ± 19 years, 61.4% were female, and 17.8% were non-White. In total, 3.3% of patients had an active malignancy. Risk-adjusted 30-day mortality was higher in the cancer cohort (odds ratio: 5.85, 95% confidence interval: 2.38-14.4, P < .001). Patients with cancer also had higher rates of infectious complications (odds ratio: 2.55, 95% confidence interval: 1.54-4.2, P < .001), including sepsis (odds ratio: 2.95, 95% confidence interval: 1.61-5.39, P < .001) and pneumonia (odds ratio: 6.67, 95% confidence interval: 1.75-25.3, P < .005). Patients with cancer were more likely to receive nonoperative management (odds ratio: 2.85, 95% confidence interval: 2.11-3.84, P < .001). Patients with cancer presenting with acute cholecystitis experience worse clinical outcomes after controlling for other factors. Furthermore, there is variation in the treatment process with increased rates of nonoperative management. These results have implications for the management of this population, particularly in relation to the impact on concurrent oncologic treatment plans."

    "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that access to robotic surgery is influenced by socioeconomic factors, including insurance status. The 2010 Affordable Care Act established an avenue for states to expand Medicaid coverage, which has increased access to surgical care for many conditions. We hypothesized that socioeconomic disparities in access to robotic repair of non-elective emergency general surgery (EGS) hernias are less prevalent in California, a Medicaid expansion state, compared to Florida, which has not adopted Medicaid expansion. The 2021 California and Florida State Inpatient Databases were used to identify all EGS admissions with an ICD-10 procedure code for ventral or inguinal hernia repair. Elective procedures and those with concurrent unrelated abdominal procedures were excluded. Patient demographics, comorbidity burden, payor status, and income quartile were abstracted. Aggregation of hospital data identified high-volume trauma, robotic, and EGS centers. There were 15,683 EGS hernia procedures of which 11% underwent robotic repair: 14% in Florida and 8% in California. On multivariable logistic regression, older age, male sex, lower income, and Medicare insurance were associated with reduced odds of robotic hernia repair in California, but not in Florida, despite an uninsured rate of 10%. The greatest predictor of robotic surgery in both states was treatment at a robotic surgery center. Overall, accounting for patient- and hospital-level factors, hernia surgeries in Florida were more likely to involve robotics (OR 1.61, CI 1.42-1.81, p < 0.001) compared to California. There were fewer disparities in access to EGS robotic hernia repairs in Florida than in California. This suggests that robotic surgery access for EGS hernia repairs is primarily determined by institutional adoption of robotic surgery, not income or payor status. Compared to California, Florida appears to have greater market penetration of robotic surgery, which has increased access to robotic EGS for all patients."

In contrast, there is limited knowledge on those patients that require emergency laparotomy but do not undergo surgery (NoLaps). A multicentre cohort study (n=64 UK surgical centres) recruited 750 consecutive NoLap patients (February 15th - November 15th 2021, inclusive of a 90-day follow up period). Each patient was admitted to hospital with a surgical condition treatable by an emergency laparotomy (defined by The National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA) criteria), but a decision was made not to undergo surgery (NoLap). NoLap patients were predominately female (452 patients, 60%), of advanced age (median age 83.0 yr, interquartile range 77.0-88.8), frail (523 patients, 70%), and had severe comorbidity (750 patients, 100%); 99% underwent CT scanning. The commonest diagnoses were perforation (26%), small bowel obstruction (17%), and ischaemic bowel (13%). The 90-day mortality was 79% and influencing factors were >80 yr, underweight BMI, elevated serum lactate or creatinine concentration. The majority of patients died in hospital (77%), with those with ischaemic bowel dying early. For the 21% of NoLap patients that survived to 90 days, 77% returned home with increased care requirements. This study reports that the NoLap patient population present significant medical challenges because of their extreme levels of comorbidity, frailty, and physiology. Despite these complexities a fifth remained alive at 90 days. Further work is underway to explore this high-risk decision-making process. ISRCTN14556210."

Patients were followed from date of cancer diagnosis, or an index date for non-cancer patients, to the development of an EGS condition, death or last follow up. We assessed the cumulative incidence of EGS conditions over time, and fit multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the impact of time-dependent surgical intervention on mortality. We identified 322,756 patients with breast (N=82,147), lung (N=128,618), and prostate cancer (N=111,991) and 210,429 non-cancer patients.. Cancer patients had a higher incidence of an EGS condition within the first year after diagnosis (4.8% vs. 3.2%), with lung (6.8%) and breast cancer (4.0%) showing consistent rends. Cancer patients were less likely to undergo surgery for (13% vs. 14%, P=0.005), though this varied by cancer type and EGS conditions. Patients with breast (HR 1.27, 95%CI 1.17-1.39) and lung cancer (HR 3.27, 95%CI 3.07-3.48) were more likely to die within 30-days of an EGS diagnosis. Cancer patients experience a higher incidence of EGS conditions within the first year following diagnosis, but are less likely to undergo surgery. Future research is needed to explore the interplay between EGS conditions, their management, and receipt of intended oncologic therapy, and resulting outcomes."

    "abstract": "Background Diagnosing acute appendicitis remains a problem, especially in teenagers with right lower quadrant pain. Imaging studies aid in accurate diagnosis but have limitations such as cost and availability. The Modified Alvarado Scoring System (MASS) is simple and cost-effective with fewer parameters. The Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha Appendicitis scoring system (RIPASA), designed for Asian populations, includes more parameters. This study compares the effectiveness of RIPASA and Alvarado scores in diagnosing acute appendicitis in a specific clinical setting. Objectives To compare the scoring systems of RIPASA and Alvarado in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis at a tertiary care hospital. Methods Data has been collected from all patients who attended the NRI general hospital emergency department and outpatient wing with acute appendicitis, admitted as inpatients based on clinical history and relevant investigations. Patients satisfying inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected and the basic investigations were done. Summary statistics were done using mean, standard deviation and proportions. Inferential statistics were done by using an independent t-test, kappa statistic, sensitivity and specificity with a 95% confidence interval (CI). All the measurements are done using the statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) software version 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and open epidemiological (OpenEpi) software 3.01. A probability (p) <0.05 is considered as statistically significant. Results A total of 110 patients were analyzed for this study with a majority (39%) of them in the 21-30 age group. In our study, females (53%) outnumbered males (47%). Ultrasound findings in our cohort were acute appendicitis (93%), chronic appendicitis (2%) and normal appendix (5%). However, histopathology reported acute appendicitis (75%), chronic appendicitis (9%) and negative/non-specific (15%). The probability of appendicitis as predicted by Alvarado and RIPASA were 40% and 51% respectively. Definitive diagnosis of appendicitis was made in 16.4% with RIPASA whereas only 5.5% with Alvarado. When comparing the Alvarado and RIPASA scores, the sensitivity or true positive rate was higher for RIPASA (73.63%) than for Alvarado (50.55%). Conclusion There was a significant difference between the mean scores in Alvarado and RIPASA inpatients with scores suggestive of appendicitis and no appendicitis. Diagnostic accuracy was higher in RIPASA scoring compared to ALVARDO scoring. There was a significant statistical difference between the two scoring systems. When it comes to diagnosing in low-resource countries the study recommends a combination of Alvarado and RIPASA scoring systems."

    "abstract": "The restructuring of nonelective general surgery and nationwide implementation of the acute care surgery paradigm has improved patient outcomes and healthcare resource utilization. Although vascular surgery maintains one of the highest acuity rates among surgical specialties, the acute care vascular surgery (ACVS) practice model has not been widely accepted. In the present study, we investigate the scope and burden of ACVS at a tertiary academic medical system. All vascular surgical procedures performed at three hospitals comprising a large tertiary academic medical system were retrospectively queried through electronic medical records. Data were collected on procedure, acuity, timing of intervention, primary service, admission type, and total costs and charges. Patients were stratified by acuity of surgical intervention, with ACVS being defined as urgent or emergent operation. A total of 12,689 vascular surgeries were performed from 2018 to 2022. ACVS procedures comprised 22.1% of this total (n = 2,803; 12.5% urgent, 9.6% emergent), with an annual burden ranging from 19.1% to 28.3%. Vascular surgeons served as primary surgeon in 91.3% of ACVS and cosurgeon in 8.7%. Fourteen separate surgical specialties requested acute vascular assistance, with the most frequently consulting specialties, including trauma or acute care surgery (ACS) (n = 109, 3.9%) and cardiac surgery (n = 74, 2.6%). ACVS cases were more frequently performed during after-hours (30.7% vs 11.6%) and on weekends (27.1% vs 2.0%) compared with elective vascular procedures (P < 0.0001 each). The majority of ACVS cases originated from inpatient (n = 2,353, 85.0%) and emergency department (n = 379, 13.5%) consultations. Overall, ACVS generated $37.5 million in charges, accounting for 14% of total procedure-related charges over the study period. ACVS comprises a substantial portion of modern vascular practice and is associated with significant human and healthcare resource expenditure. These data support the development of practice models dedicated to acute vascular surgical care."

    "abstract": "Gallstone ileus is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening complication of gallstone disease, characterized by the obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract by a gallstone, typically at the ileocecal valve. This condition predominantly affects elderly patients and carries a high risk of morbidity and mortality due to delayed diagnosis and the complexity of associated comorbidities. We report the case of a 60-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and cholelithiasis who presented with a four-day history of intermittent epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, and an inability to pass stool or flatus. Initial imaging studies, including ultrasonography and computed tomography, revealed a biliary-enteric fistula with a large obstructing gallstone at the ileocecal valve. Despite conservative management with intravenous fluids, nasogastric tube suction, and antibiotics, the patient's symptoms persisted, necessitating surgical intervention. A midline laparotomy was performed, during which the gallstone was successfully removed via enterotomy. The patient recovered without complications and was discharged in stable condition. The complexity of management, particularly in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities, necessitates careful consideration between the one-stage and two-stage surgical approaches. In this case, the decision to perform an enterotomy without immediate cholecystectomy reflects a two-stage strategy, aimed at minimizing operative risk while addressing the immediate obstruction. This approach underscores the need for individualized management plans, where the choice between one-stage and two-stage surgery is guided by the patient's overall clinical status."

This study investigates the impact of housing status on complications and 30-day follow-up, emergency department visits, and readmissions after emergency general surgery admission. We conducted a retrospective matched cohort study of adult patients admitted with an emergency general surgery diagnosis at an urban, safety net hospital from 2014 to 2021. Patients were matched 1 to 2 on the basis of age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, diagnosis, and operative status. The primary exposure was unhoused status. The primary outcome was in-hospital complications. Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit admission, extended length of stay, follow-up attendance, and emergency department visit or unplanned readmission within 30 days. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to determine the association between housing status and the outcomes of interest. The study included 531 patients (177 unhoused, 354 housed). There were no significant differences in complications, intensive care unit admissions, or extended length of stay. Unhoused patients had lower odds of outpatient follow-up (odds ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.85, P = .008) and higher odds of emergency department utilization (odds ratio, 2.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.78-4.14, P < .001) and readmission (odds ratio, 1.87; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-3.19, P = .02). Compared with housed patients, unhoused patients with emergency general surgery conditions have lower rates of outpatient follow-up and greater odds of using the emergency department and being readmitted within 30 days of discharge. This points to a need for dedicated posthospitalization care and creative methods of engaging with this population."

In addition, procedures performed by a single resident from July 1, 2020, to June 30, 2022, were separately indexed for a more granular analysis. The results are presented with total 5-year numbers listed first, followed by single resident 2-year numbers in parentheses. The residents at the CIP carried out 8676 (1,609) tabulated procedures. Major surgical procedures included 573 (154) laparotomies, 364 (129) thoracotomies, 279 (125) splenectomies, 219 (108) craniotomies, 206 (81) hepatorrhaphies, 363 (62) nephrectomies, 383 (48) bowel resections, 215 (48) spine exposures with laminectomies, and 173 (9) sternotomies. Additional procedures included 1028 (127) central venous lines, 878 (127) arterial lines, 90 (67) tube thoracostomies, 199 (37) carotid artery exposures, 394 (29) suprapubic urostomies, and placement of 278 (10) aortic occlusion catheters. At this time, the residents had 17 (10) presentations at national meetings, 8 (7) research awards, and published 20 peer-reviewed manuscripts. Additionally, the residents involved in the CCCRP gained valuable experience in critical care, including management of 110 traumatic brain injuries, 121 Intercranial Pressure catheters, 316 cases of hemorrhagic shock, and 211 massive transfusion protocols, among a variety of other vital critical care skills. This large animal CCCRP represents a unique training model that not only achieves its primary goal of fostering graduate medical education research but also bolsters Emergency General Surgery readiness for military surgical residents."

    "abstract": "Acute kidney injury is associated with poor outcomes in the trauma and emergency general surgery population, and recent consensus definitions have allowed for significant advances in defining the burden of disease. The current definitions rely on overall functional measures (i.e., serum creatinine and urine output), which can be confounded by a variety of clinical factors. Biomarkers are increasingly being investigated as more direct diagnostic assays for the diagnosis of acute kidney injury and may allow earlier detection and more timely therapeutic intervention. Etiologies fall into two general categories: disorders of renal perfusion and exposure to nephrotoxic agents. Therapy is largely supportive, and prevention offers the best chance to decrease clinical impact."

    "abstract": "High-quality health information handovers are critical to optimal patient care and trainee education. The purposes of this study were to assess the feasibility of implementing an emergency general surgery (EGS) morning handover and to explore its impact upon markers of clinical care. This prospective feasibility study was conducted at a single academic tertiary-care medical center following implementation of a novel EGS morning handover process. We assessed organizational perspective through a two-part anonymous survey delivered to the EGS service staff (n = 29) and collected feasibility metrics daily at the morning handover meetings. Exploratory clinical metrics of quality improvement were compared between parallel 5-month periods preimplementation and postimplementation of the handover. Data were compared by descriptive statistics. One hundred and seventeen patients from March 1, 2022, to July 31, 2022, and 185 patients from March 1, 2023, to July 31, 2023, were identified prehandover and posthandover implementation, respectively, with an increase in time to operating room posting by 49% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-2.14) and no statistically significant change in length of stay. The average duration of the formalized EGS morning handover was 14 min (95% CI: 12:18-15:42) having an average of 12 questions asked (95% CI: 9.98-14.02) and an average attendance of 70% from essential personnel. Eighty-four percent of postimplementation survey responses indicated positive regard toward the new EGS handover. The implementation of an EGS morning handover is feasible, necessitating further studies to define the impact of the EGS morning handover upon clinical outcomes."

This is a retrospective study of older-adult EGS patients at an academic medical center between 2017 and 2018. Patients ≥65 years were included. The primary outcomes examined were 30-day mortality, 30-day morbidity, and length of stay (LOS). 734 patients were included. The mean age was 76, and 48.9 ​% received non-operative management. The median LOS was 6.8 days; 11.8 ​% of patients died within 30 days, and 40.6 ​% developed morbidities. Lacking capacity to consent on admission was independently associated with 30-day mortality (OR: 2.63, [1.32-5.25], p ​= ​0.006). Comorbidities associated with developing morbidity were CVA with neurologic deficit (OR: 2.29, [1.20-4.36], p ​= ​0.012), CHF (OR: 2.60, [1.64-4.11], p ​< ​0.001), in addition to pre-operative delirium (OR: 3.42, [1.43-8.14], p ​= ​0.006). A significant contribution to outcomes is determined by pre-admission comorbidities and cognitive and functional status. Opportunities exist for collaboration between Acute Care Surgery and geriatric medicine teams for the optimization of comorbidities."

    "title": "The contemporary management of perforated appendicitis in adults: To operate or wait?",
    "abstract": "The optimal management of perforated appendicitis remains controversial. Many studies advocate for antibiotics and an interval appendectomy whereas others suggest that performing an appendectomy at the time of presentation decreases post-operative morbidity. Confounding this argument further are the patients who fail non-operative management and end up requiring surgery during their initial hospitalization. This study aims to determine if early operative intervention should be considered for perforated appendicitis. This was a retrospective review of all patients who underwent an appendectomy (both laparoscopic or open) for perforated appendicitis between 2015 and 2020 at our institution. A total of 271 patients met inclusion criteria for this study. Of this group, 250 patients underwent an immediate appendectomy whereas the remaining 21 patients underwent a trial of non-operative management and eventually required an appendectomy during their initial admission. When comparing the immediate versus delayed operative groups, there were no differences in demographic data including age and gender, and no differences in various imaging findings including AAST Grade IV or V appendicitis. Operatively, patients in the delayed group had a longer operative time (83.1 ± 32.9 vs. 64.1 ± 26.2, p = 0.01), were more likely to require an open operation (23.8 % vs. 2.8 %, p < 0.0001), and were more likely to have a drain placed intra-operatively (42.9 % vs 14.4 %, p = 0.004). While there were no differences in 30-day readmission rates, patients in the delayed group had a significantly longer hospital length of stay than patients in the immediate group (9.4 ± 7.4 vs. 3.1 ± 3.3, p = 0.008). Patients undergoing an immediate appendectomy for perforated appendicitis can discharge from the hospital sooner and demonstrate no increase in post-operative morbidity suggesting that surgeons can initially manage this disease process in an operative fashion."

    "abstract": "Background Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is more common in the hospital population and has an estimated annual incidence of 67 per 100,000. Surgery is a risk factor for DVT and has been proven to cause morbidity and mortality in the postoperative period. The correlation between the frequency of DVT and major surgical procedures has been demonstrated. However, few studies have been conducted on the relationship between emergency surgeries and the incidence of DVT. Our study aims to determine the prevalence of postoperative DVT in patients undergoing emergency laparotomies. Methods This prospective observational study was conducted over 18 months, from January 2021 to July 2022. Patients who underwent emergency exploratory laparotomies were included in this study. Duplex ultrasonography was done preoperatively to exclude patients with DVT. A serial duplex ultrasound was performed to detect DVT until the seventh postoperative day. All the clinicopathological and surgical information of patients relevant to this study was collected and analyzed. Results Out of 146 patients, one developed DVT in the postoperative period. The patient who experienced DVT had no other known risk factors; however, his age of 60 was a risk factor for DVT. So, the reported prevalence of DVT in our study population was just 0.68% of emergency exploratory laparotomy patients. Conclusion Our study reports DVT in only one case out of 146 patients who underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy without routine pharmacological prophylaxis. We might, therefore, conclude that emergency exploratory laparotomy may be a separate risk factor for the emergence of DVT. More prospective studies with large sample sizes should be done to evaluate the prevalence of DVT in emergency exploratory laparotomies."

    "abstract": "Racial and ethnic disparities in emergency general surgery (EGS) patients have been well described in the literature. Nonetheless, the burden of these disparities, specifically within the more vulnerable older adult population, is relatively unknown. This study aims to investigate racial and ethnic disparities in clinical outcomes among older adult patients undergoing EGS. This retrospective analysis used data from 2013 to 2019 American College of Surgeons National Surgery Quality Improvement Program database. EGS patients aged 65 y or older were included. Patients were categorized based on their self-reported race and ethnicity. The primary outcomes evaluated were in-hospital mortality, 30-d mortality, and overall morbidity. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to examine the relationship between race/ethnicity and postoperative outcomes while adjusting for relevant factors including age, comorbidities, functional status, preoperative conditions, and surgical procedure. A total of 54,132 patients were included, of whom 79.8% identified as non-Hispanic White, 9.5% as non-Hispanic Black (NHB), 5.8% as Hispanic, and 4.2% as non-Hispanic Asian. After risk adjustment, compared to non-Hispanic White patients, NHB, non-Hispanic Asian, and Hispanic patients had decreased odds of 30-d mortality. For 30-d readmission and reoperation, differences among groups were comparable. However, NHB patients had significantly increased odds of overall morbidity (adjusted odds ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval: 1.10-1.26; P < 0.001) and postoperative complications including sepsis, venous thromboembolism, and unplanned intubation. Hispanic ethnicity was associated with lower odds of postoperative myocardial infarction and stroke. Among older adult patients undergoing emergency general surgery, minority patients experienced higher morbidity rates, but paradoxical disparities in mortality were detected. Further research is necessary to identify the cause of these disparities and develop targeted interventions to eliminate them."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery is typically delivered in addition to routine elective care. Models such as acute surgical assessment units and reduced elective working have been explored to reduce the conflict between these competing demands. We aim to identify the models used, the cohorts of patients seen, and the staffing levels in each system. Data on general surgery activities were obtained from the National Quality Assurance and Improvement System (NQAIS) and previously published data. The mode of delivery of acute services in other countries was collated from national surgical bodies and published position statements. National on-call services are supra-elective or parallel to elective streams with little dedicated on-call. Internationally, many similar countries are moving to separate acute and elective care to ensure both are performing optimally. Staff in Model 3 hospitals are frequently on call with variable but small operative numbers but represent a combination of high and low acuity. These consultants need a wider breadth of surgical skills than Model 4 hospitals due to a lack of local specialists. The majority of national hospitals still work a traditional on-call model, with limited adoption of separate on-call and elective workstreams. Preserving the elective workload is likely to require separation of these priorities, which is difficult with current staffing levels. The use of Acute Surgical Assessment Units (ASAUs) within emergency surgical networks may improve patient outcomes by regionalising the delivery of higher acuity care."

There are few PRO data for patients undergoing emergency general surgery (EGS) procedures. Sudden illness and injury are associated with worse health-related quality of life, symptoms of depression, post-traumatic stress. This study aimed to evaluate PRO and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in an EGS population. Patients who underwent an EGS operation and had quality improvement data available from Jan 2020 to Jan 2021 were eligible for inclusion. Participants completed a survey of demographics, socio-economic status, PROMIS PRO measures for general life satisfaction (GLS), general self-efficacy (GSE), and physical function (PF), and the PCL-5 PTSD symptom screening tool. One hundred forty-one patients were eligible for inclusion, 40 (28%) completed the study. Mean PRO scores were 52.5 ± 9.3 for GLS, 48.6 ± 8.0 for GSE, and 48.7 ± 9.6 for PF. 12.5% of patients had a low or very low GLS and GSE score, while 32.5% had mild, moderate, or severe PF scores. Seven patients (17.5%) scored >31 on PCL-5 indicating a positive PTSD screen. Regression analysis found American society of anesthesiology score, emergency case, and lower income associated with lower GLS scores. Age, body mass index, and lower income were associated with lower PF scores. We found that following EGS most patients have average PRO. This limited study did also identify that there are patients potentially at risk for worse functional and mental health outcomes. We plan to use this data to prospectively evaluate the role that EGS plays in these outcomes and how they can be improved on."

    "abstract": "European training pathways for surgeons dedicated to treating severely injured and critically ill surgical patients lack a standardized approach and are significantly influenced by diverse organizational and cultural backgrounds. This variation extends into the realm of mentorship, a vital component for the holistic development of surgeons beyond mere technical proficiency. Currently, a comprehensive understanding of the mentorship landscape within the European trauma care (visceral or skeletal) and emergency general surgery (EGS) communities is lacking. This study aims to identify within the current mentorship environment prevalent practices, discern existing gaps, and propose structured interventions to enhance mentorship quality and accessibility led by the European Society for Trauma and Emergency Surgery (ESTES). Utilizing a structured survey conceived and promoted by the Young section of the European Society of Trauma and Emergency Surgery (yESTES), we collected and analyzed responses from 123 ESTES members (both surgeons in practice and in training) across 20 European countries. The survey focused on mentorship experiences, challenges faced by early-career and female surgeons, the integration of non-technical skills (NTS) in mentorship, and the perceived role of surgical societies in facilitating mentorship. Findings highlighted a substantial mentorship experience gap, with 74% of respondents engaging in mostly informal mentorship, predominantly centered on surgical training. Notably, mentorship among early-career surgeons and trainees was less reported, uncovering a significant early-career gap. Female surgeons, representing a minority within respondents, reported a disproportionately poorer access to mentorship. Moreover, while respondents recognized the importance of NTS, these were inadequately addressed in current mentorship practices. The current mentorship input of surgical societies, like ESTES, is viewed as insufficient, with a call for structured programs and initiatives such as traveling fellowships and remote mentoring. Our survey underscores critical gaps in the current mentorship landscape for trauma and EGS in Europe, particularly for early-career and female surgeons. A clear need exists for more formalized, inclusive mentorship programs that adequately cover both technical and non-technical skills. ESTES could play a pivotal role in addressing these gaps through structured interventions, fostering a more supportive, inclusive, and well-rounded surgical community."

Here, we analyzed the association of acute care surgeons on postoperative outcomes of emergency general surgery. This retrospective study included 92 patients who underwent emergency general surgery at our institution between January 2020 and September 2021. Propensity score matching was used to analyze postoperative outcomes. The primary outcome was postoperative complications, while secondary outcomes included perioperative management and surgery-related and postoperative complications. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the odds ratios for all complications. In this study, acute care surgeons were defined as acute care surgery (ACS)-certified surgeons by the Japanese Society for Acute Care Surgery. Overall, 30 patients were treated by an acute care surgeon and general surgeons (ACS group), and 62 patients were treated by general surgeons (non-ACS group), respectively. Propensity score matching identified 30 patients with balanced baseline covariates, in each group. The ACS group had lower complication rates (Clavien-Dindo classification ≥2) than the non-ACS group (17% versus 40%, P = 0.08). The ACS group had a significantly shorter surgery duration than the non-ACS group (75 min versus 96 min, P = 0.014). In the logistic analysis, acute care surgeon involvement was identified as an independent predictor for the decrease in all complications (odds ratio, 0.15; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.64). It was suggested that the involvement of acute care surgeons may reduce the overall complication rate in emergency general surgery."

The acute care surgery (ACS) model has been shown to improve EGS patient outcomes and cost-effectiveness. A recent systematic review has shown extensive heterogeneity in the structure of ACS models worldwide. The objective of this study was to describe the current landscape of ACS models in academic centres across Canada. We sent an online questionnaire to the 18 academic centres in Canada. The lead ACS physicians from each institution completed the questionnaire, describing the structure of their ACS models. In total, 16 institutions responded, all of which reported having ACS models, with a total of 29 ACS services described. All services had resident coverage. Of the 29, 18 (62%) had dedicated allied health care staff. The staff surgeon was free from elective duties while covering ACS in 17/29 (59%) services. More than half (15/29; 52%) of the services described protected ACS operating room time, but only 7/15 (47%) had a dedicated ACS room all 5 weekdays. Four of 29 services (14%) had no protected ACS operating room time. Only 1/16 (6%) institutions reported a mandate to conduct ACS research, while 12/16 (75%) found ACS research difficult, owing to lack of resources. We saw large variations in the structure of ACS models in academic centres in Canada. The components of ACS models that are most important to patient outcomes remain poorly defined. Future research will focus on defining the necessary cornerstones of ACS models. Les personnes qui ont besoin d’une chirurgie générale d’urgence (CGU) sont exposées à un risque nettement plus élevé de morbidité et de mortalité périopératoires comparativement aux personnes soumises à une chirurgie générale non urgente. Il a été démontré que le modèle de chirurgie en soins actifs (CSA) améliore le rapport coût–efficacité et les résultats pour les personnes soumises à une CGU. Selon une récente revue systématique, la structure des modèles de CSA est très hétérogène dans le monde. L’objectif de cette étude était de décrire le paysage actuel des modèles de CSA dans les centres hospitaliers universitaires au Canada. Nous avons fait parvenir un questionnaire en ligne aux 18 centres hospitaliers universitaires canadiens. Les médecins responsables des services de CSA de chaque établissement ont répondu au questionnaire et ont décrit la structure de leurs modèles de CSA. En tout, 16 établissements ont répondu et tous ont indiqué qu’ils disposent de modèles de CSA; 29 services de CSA ont ainsi été décrits. Des médecins résidents assuraient la couverture de tous ces services. Sur les 29 services de CSA, 18 (62 %) disposaient d’une équipe soignante dédiée. La chirurgienne ou le chirurgien en poste était relevé de ses fonctions non urgentes pendant sa couverture des services de CSA dans 17 services sur 29 (59 %). Plus de la moitié (52 %) des services ont déclaré réserver du temps pour la CSA au bloc opératoire, mais seulement 7 sur 15 (47 %) disposaient d’un bloc opératoire réservé à la CSA du lundi au vendredi. Quatre services sur 29 (14 %) ne disposaient pas de temps réservé au bloc opératoire pour la CSA. Un seul établissement sur 16 (6 %) s’est fait confier le mandat de faire de la recherche sur la CSA, tandis que 12 sur 16 (75 %) ont déploré un manque de ressources, ce qui rend la recherche sur la CSA difficile. Nous avons observé une grande hétérogénéité structurale entre les différents modèles de CSA appliqués dans les centres hospitaliers universitaires canadiens et leurs éléments les plus importants pour les résultats chez les patients demeurent mal définis. La recherche devra se poursuivre sur les aspects incontournables des modèles de CSA."

Only 9 of the 408 screened articles met the criteria for quantitative assessment. Telemedicine appears to be preferentially used for more severely injured patients. Limited quality evidence supports procedural interventions at remote sites. Telemedicine may help abbreviate pre-transfer length of stay. However, its impact on diagnosis and mortality remains unclear.

The current single-center, retrospective, observational study was conducted in a consecutive series of the patients with AA who had been surgically treated at a tertiary referral hospital in Seoul, Korea, between January 2016 and December 2020. At our institution, the ACS model was first introduced in March 2018. Therefore, our clinical series of the patients were divided into 2 groups: the pre-ACS group (March 2014 to February 2018) and the post-ACS group (March 2018 to December 2022). Key time intervals include emergency department registration to request for surgical consultation, request for surgical consultation to decision on surgery, decision-to-operating room, time to decision on surgery and length of emergency department stay. Moreover, outcomes include rates of perforation and complications and discharge within 24 or 48 hours. We compared key time intervals, outcomes, and length of hospital stay between the 2 groups. A total of 900 patients with AA were finally included in the current study, 447 and 453 of whom were divided into the pre-ACS group (n = 447) and the post-ACS group (n = 453), respectively. There were significant differences in key time intervals, outcomes, and length of hospital stay between the 2 groups (P < .05). In conclusion, our results showed that the implementation of the ACS model was effective in improving key time intervals, rates of perforation, and discharge within 24 or 48 hours in the patients with AA."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) often demands timely interventions, yet data for triage and timing are limited. This study explores the relationship between hospital arrival-to-operation time and mortality in EGS patients. We performed a retrospective cohort study using an EGS registry at four hospitals, enrolling adults who underwent operative intervention for a primary American Association for the Surgery of Trauma-defined EGS diagnosis between 2021 and 2023. We excluded patients undergoing surgery more than 72 hours after admission as non-urgent and defined our exposure of interest as the time from the initial vital sign capture to the skin incision timestamp. We assessed the association between operative timing quintiles and in-hospital mortality using a mixed-effect hierarchical multivariable model, adjusting for patient demographics, comorbidities, organ dysfunction, and clustering at the hospital level. A total of 1199 patients were included. The median time to operating room (OR) was 8.2 hours (IQR 4.9-20.5 hours). Prolonged time to OR increased the relative likelihood of in-hospital mortality. Patients undergoing an operation between 6.7 and 10.7 hours after first vitals had the highest odds of in-hospital mortality compared with operative times <4.2 hours (reference quintile) (adjusted OR (aOR) 68.994; 95% CI 4.608 to 1032.980, p=0.002). A similar trend was observed among patients with operative times between 24.4 and 70.9 hours (aOR 69.682; 95% CI 2.968 to 1636.038, p=0.008). Our findings suggest that prompt operative intervention is associated with lower in-hospital mortality rates among EGS patients. Further work to identify the most time-sensitive populations is warranted. These results may begin to inform benchmarking for triaging interventions in the EGS population to help reduce mortality rates. IV."

Without risk factors, mortality rates were 11.9 ​% after colectomy and 10.2 ​% after small bowel resection. Patients with all three risk factors had a mortality rate of 79.4 ​% and 100 ​% following colectomy and small bowel resection, respectively. In older adults undergoing emergent open abdominal surgery, septic shock, ASA status, and dialysis were strongly associated with futility of surgical intervention. These findings can inform goals of care and informed decision-making."

    "abstract": "Over 3 million patients are admitted to hospitals annually with high-acuity conditions mandating emergency abdominal or skin/soft-tissue operations. Patients with these high-acuity emergency general surgery (HA-EGS) diseases experience significant morbidity and mortality, yet the quality-of-life impact on survivors is not well studied. Acuity, transfer patterns, and adverse social determinants of health documented in epidemiologic studies are cited reasons for inability to measure patient-reported outcomes among HA-EGS survivors. We conducted a feasibility study to understand facilitators/barriers to conducting prospective studies of changes in quality of life after surviving HA-EGS. From September 2019 to April 2021, we collected baseline (preadmission) and 30/60 days' postsurgery data on activities of daily living, depression, self-efficacy, resilience, pain, work limitations, social support, and substance use from patients who enrolled in the study during index hospitalization. One hundred patients consented to participate (71.9% enrollment rate). The retention rate was 65.9% for 30-day follow-up telephone calls and 53.8% for 60-day follow-up calls. Median time needed to complete each time point remained under 25 minutes. Patients with a longer length of stay and nicotine users had higher odds of not completing their 30-day interview, while those with systemic complications had higher odds of not completing their 60-day interview. These results lay the foundation for future patient-reported outcome studies."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgeons often provide care to severely ill patients requiring surgical interventions and intensive support. One of the primary drivers of morbidity and mortality is perioperative bleeding. In general, when addressing life threatening haemorrhage, blood transfusion can become an essential part of overall resuscitation. However, under all circumstances, indications for blood transfusion must be accurately evaluated. When patients decline blood transfusions, regardless of the reason, surgeons should aim to provide optimal care and respect and accommodate each patient's values and target the best outcome possible given the patient's desires and his/her clinical condition. The aim of this position paper was to perform a review of the existing literature and to provide comprehensive recommendations on organizational, surgical, anaesthetic, and haemostatic strategies that can be used to provide optimal peri-operative blood management, reduce, or avoid blood transfusions and ultimately improve patient outcomes."

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a small bowel obstruction (SBO) from ileal stricture consistent with gastrointestinal (GI) TB. He did not require an emergent surgical intervention and was managed conservatively via bowel rest and initiation of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). An oral BPaL-M regimen was held and an intravenous (IV) regimen consisting of linezolid, moxifloxacin, meropenem, and ampicillin/sulbactam was started per infectious disease (ID) recommendations. He improved clinically over the next several days and was started on a diet that was initially well tolerated. Shortly after transitioning to a regular diet, he developed severe abdominal pain. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed pneumoperitoneum and he was taken emergently to the operating room (OR) for exploratory laparotomy (ex-lap). A perforation was found in the terminal ileum and he underwent a right hemicolectomy. He returned to the OR two days later for ileocolic anastomosis and fascial closure. A diet was initiated once again which was tolerated well. He was then transitioned back to his oral BPaL-M regimen which was also tolerated well. He was discharged home on an oral diet after a 23-day hospital course with follow-up appointments with acute care surgery (ACS) and ID."

    "abstract": "For many years, robotic surgery has been an option for various elective surgical procedures. Though robotic surgery has not traditionally been the first choice for acute surgical patients, recent work has shown promise in broader applications. However, there are limited data regarding how to establish an institutional robotics program for higher acuity patients. This project aimed to map a pathway for the creation of an acute care surgery robotic program at a large academic medical center. Various stakeholders were gathered jointly with our surgical faculty: anesthesia, operating room leadership, surgical technologists, circulating nurses, Central Sterile Supply, and Intuitive Surgical Inc. representatives. Staff underwent robotics training, and surgical technologists were trained as bedside first assistants. Nontraditional robotic operating rooms were allocated for coordinated placement of appropriate cases, and pre-made case carts were arranged with staff to be available at all hours. A workflow was created between surgical faculty and staff to streamline add-on robotic cases to the daily schedule. Six faculty and two fellows are now credentialed in robotics surgery, and additional surgeons are undergoing training. Numerous staff have completed training to perform operative assistant duties. The operating capacity of robotic acute care surgeries has more than doubled in just one year, from 77 to 172 cases between 2022 and 2023, respectively. Two add-on cases can be accommodated per day. Select patients are being offered robotic surgeries in the acute surgical setting, and ongoing efforts are being made to create guidelines for which patients would best benefit from robotic procedures. Launching a successful robotic surgery program requires a coordinated, multidisciplinary effort to ensure seamless integration into daily operations. Additional assistance from outside technology representatives can help to ensure comfort with procedures. Further studies are needed to determine the acute patient population that may benefit most from robotic surgery."

    "abstract": "Failure to rescue (FTR) is increasingly recognized as a quality metric but remains understudied in emergency general surgery (EGS). We sought to identify patient and operative factors associated with FTR to better inform standardized metrics to mitigate this potentially preventable event. All adult (≥18 years) non-elective hospitalizations for large bowel resection, small bowel resection, repair of perforated ulcer, laparotomy and lysis of adhesions were identified in the 2016-2020 National Readmissions Database. Patients undergoing trauma-related operations or procedures ≤2 days of admission were excluded. FTR was defined as in-hospital death following acute kidney injury requiring dialysis (AKI), myocardial infarction, pneumonia, respiratory failure, sepsis, stroke, or thromboembolism. Multilevel mixed-effect models were developed to assess factors linked with FTR. Among 826,548 EGS operations satisfying inclusion criteria, 298,062 (36.1 %) developed at least one MAE. Of those experiencing MAE, 43,477 (14.6 %) ultimately did not survive to discharge (FTR). Following adjustment for fixed hospital level effects, only 3.5 % of the variance in FTR was attributable to center-level differences. Relative to private insurance and the highest income quartile, Medicaid insurance (AOR 1.33; 95%CI, 1.23-1.43) and the lowest income quartile (AOR 1.22; 95%CI, 1.17-1.29) were linked with increased odds of FTR.A subset analysis stratified complication-specific rates of FTR by insurance status. Relative to private insurance, Medicaid coverage and uninsured status were linked with greater odds of FTR following perioperative sepsis, pneumonia, and AKI. Our findings underscore the need for increased screening and vigilance following perioperative complications to mitigate disparities in patient outcomes following high-risk EGS."

    "abstract": "Robot-assisted general surgery, an advanced technology in minimally invasive procedures, is increasingly employed in elective general surgery, showing benefits over laparoscopy in specific cases. Although laparoscopy remains a standard approach for common acute abdominal conditions, the role of robotic surgery in emergency general surgery remains uncertain. This systematic review aims to compare outcomes in acute general surgery settings for robotic versus laparoscopic surgeries. A PRISMA-compliant systematic search across MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and the Cochrane Library was conducted. The literature review focused on articles comparing perioperative outcomes of emergency general surgery managed laparoscopically versus robot-assisted. A descriptive analysis was performed, and outcome measures were recorded. Six articles, involving 1,063 patients, compared outcomes of robotic and laparoscopic procedures. Two articles covered cholecystectomies, while the others addressed ileocaecal resection, subtotal colectomy, hiatal hernia and repair of perforated gastrojejunal ulcers. The level of evidence was low. Laparoscopic bowel resection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) had higher complications; no significant differences were found in complications for other operations. Operative time showed no differences for cholecystectomies, but robotic approaches took longer for other procedures. Robotic cases had shorter hospital length of stay, although the associated costs were significantly higher. Perioperative outcomes for emergency robotic surgery in selected general surgery conditions are comparable to laparoscopic surgery. However, recommending robotic surgery in the acute setting necessitates a well-powered large population study for stronger evidence."

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic posed a worldwide challenge, leading to radical changes in surgical services. The primary objective of the study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 on elective and emergency surgeries in a Brazilian metropolitan area. The secondary objective was to compare the postoperative hospital mortality before and during the pandemic. Time-series cohort study including data of all patients admitted for elective or emergency surgery at the hospitals in the Public Health System of Federal District, Brazil, between March 2018 and February 2022, using data extracted from the Hospital Information System of Brazilian Ministry of Health (SIH/DATASUS) on September 30, 2022. A causal impact analysis was used to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on elective and emergency surgeries and hospital mortality. There were 174,473 surgeries during the study period. There was a reduction in overall (absolute effect per week: -227.5; 95% CI: -307.0 to -149.0), elective (absolute effect per week: -170.9; 95% CI: -232.8 to -112.0), and emergency (absolute effect per week: -57.7; 95% CI: -87.5 to -27.7) surgeries during the COVID-19 period. Comparing the surgeries performed before and after the COVID-19 onset, there was an increase in emergency surgeries (53.0% vs 68.8%, P < 0.001) and no significant hospital length of stay (P = 0.112). The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on postoperative hospital mortality was not statistically significant (absolute effect per week: 2.1, 95% CI: -0.01 to 4.2). Our study showed a reduction in elective and emergency surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic, possibly due to disruptions in surgical services. These findings highlight that it is crucial to implement effective strategies to prevent the accumulation of surgical waiting lists in times of crisis and improve outcomes for surgical patients."

    "abstract": "The decision to undertake a surgical intervention for an emergency general surgery (EGS) condition (appendicitis, diverticulitis, cholecystitis, hernia, peptic ulcer, bowel obstruction, ischemic bowel) involves a complex consideration of factors, particularly in older adults. We hypothesized that identifying variability in the application of operative management could highlight a potential pathway to improve patient survival and outcomes. We included adults aged 65+ years with an EGS condition from the 2016-2017 National Inpatient Sample. Operative management was determined from procedure codes. Each patient was assigned a propensity score (PS) for the likelihood of undergoing an operation, modeled from patient and hospital factors: EGS diagnosis, age, gender, race, presence of shock, comorbidities, and hospital EGS volumes. Low and high probability for surgery was defined using a PS cut-off of 0.5. We identified two model-concordant groups (no surgery-low probability, surgery-high probability) and two model-discordant groups (no surgery-high probability, surgery-low probability). Logistic regression estimated the adjusted OR (AOR) of in-hospital mortality for each group. Of 375 546 admissions, 21.2% underwent surgery. Model-discordant care occurred in 14.6%; 5.9% had no surgery despite a high PS and 8.7% received surgery with low PS. In the adjusted regression, model-discordant care was associated with significantly increased mortality: no surgery-high probability AOR 2.06 (1.86 to 2.27), surgery-low probability AOR 1.57 (1.49 to 1.65). Model-concordant care showed a protective effect against mortality (AOR 0.83, 0.74 to 0.92). Nearly one in seven EGS patients received model-discordant care, which was associated with higher mortality. Our study suggests that streamlined treatment protocols can be applied in EGS patients as a means to save lives. III."

    "abstract": "Robot-assisted surgery has seen exponential adoption over the last decade. Although the safety and efficacy of robotic surgery in the elective setting have been demonstrated, data regarding robotic emergency general surgery remains sparse. All adults undergoing non-elective appendectomy, cholecystectomy, small or large bowel resection, perforated ulcer repair, or lysis of adhesions were identified in the 2008 to 2020 National Inpatient Sample. Temporal trends were analyzed using a rank-based, non-parametric test developed by Cuzick (nptrend). Using laparoscopy as a reference, multivariable regressions were used to evaluate the association between robotic techniques and in-hospital mortality, major complications, and resource use for each emergency general surgery operation. Of an estimated 4,040,555 patients undergoing emergency general surgery, 65,853 (1.6%) were performed using robotic techniques. The robotic proportion of minimally invasive emergency general surgery increased significantly overall, with the largest growth seen in robot-assisted large bowel resections and perforated ulcer repairs. After adjustment for various patient and hospital-level factors, robot-assisted large bowel resection (adjusted odds ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.58-0.91) and cholecystectomy (adjusted odds ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.55-0.81) were associated with significantly reduced odds of perioperative blood transfusion compared to traditional laparoscopy. Although robotic techniques were associated with modest reductions in postoperative length of stay, costs were uniformly higher by increments of up to $4,900. Robotic surgery appears to be a safe and effective adjunct to laparoscopy in minimally invasive emergency general surgery, although comparable cost-effectiveness has yet to be realized. Increasing use of robotic techniques in emergency general surgery may be attributable in part to reduced complications, including blood loss, in certain operative contexts."

    "abstract": "Obesity is increasingly prevalent both nationwide and in the emergency general surgery (EGS) population. While previous studies have shown that obesity may be protective against mortality following EGS procedures, the association between body mass index (BMI) and postoperative outcomes, as well as intraoperative decision-making, remains understudied. The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program 2015-2019 database was used to identify all adult patients undergoing an open abdominal or abdominal wall procedure for EGS conditions. Our outcomes included 30-d postoperative mortality, composite 30-d morbidity, delayed fascial closure, reoperation, operative time, and hospital length of stay (LOS). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to explore the association between BMI and each outcome of interest while adjusting for patient demographics, comorbidities, laboratory tests, preoperative and intraoperative variables. We identified 78,578 patients, of which 3121 (4%) were categorized as underweight, 23,661 (30.1%) as normal weight, 22,072 (28.1%) as overweight, 14,287 (18.2%) with class I obesity, 7370 (9.4%) with class II obesity, and 8067 (10.3%) with class III obesity. Class III obesity was identified as a risk factor for 30-d postoperative morbidity (adjusted odds ratio 1.14, 95% CI, 1.03-1.26, P < 0.01). An increase in obesity class was also associated with a stepwise increase in the risk of undergoing delayed fascial closure, experiencing a prolonged operative time, and having an extended LOS. Obesity class was associated with an increase in delayed fascial closure, longer operative time, higher reoperation rates, and extended hospital LOS. Further studies are needed to explore how a patient's BMI impacts intraoperative factors, influences surgical decision-making, and contributes to hospital costs."

Our study aimed to explore the association of body mass index (BMI) with postoperative outcomes in patients requiring common EGS procedures. A retrospective review of the 2018-2020 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database identified patients undergoing four common EGS procedures: large bowel resection, small bowel resection, cholecystectomy, and appendectomy. Patients were classified by BMI: normal weight (18.5-24.9 kg/m2), obesity classes I (30-34.9 kg/m2), II (35-39.9 kg/m2), III (40-49.9 kg/m2), and IV (≥50 kg/m2). Main outcomes of interest were major adverse event (MAE) and mortality. From 2018 to 2020, a total of 82,540 patients underwent one of four common EGS procedures. On unadjusted analysis, obesity class IV had higher mortality rates compared to classes I-III (6.2% vs 3.1%, P < 0.001). Patients in obesity classes I-III had lower odds of MAE and death relative to those of normal weight. Compared to other patients with obesity, those in obesity class IV were at increased risk of MAE (odds ratio 1.27; 95% confidence interval 1.13-1.44) and death (odds ratio 1.69; 95% confidence interval 1.34-2.13). Patients with varying degrees of obesity have different risk profiles following common EGS procedures. While patients in lower obesity classes had reduced odds of adverse outcomes, those with BMI ≥50 kg/m2 were particularly at greater risk for postoperative morbidity and mortality. This vulnerable population warrants further investigation and increased vigilance to ensure high-quality care."

We report a case of a 79-year-old male who initially presented with altered mental status and stroke-like symptoms; he was ultimately diagnosed with abdominal wall NF spreading to the lower extremity. Despite a history of cecal mass perforation noted in prior imaging, the patient had been discharged from an outside emergency room on antibiotics, highlighting a missed opportunity for early intervention. Subsequent deterioration led to sepsis, organ failure, and ultimately, the detection of NF. Prompt recognition of subtle skin changes and laboratory abnormalities, along with a detailed physical examination, is essential for a timely and accurate diagnosis. Surgical debridement, coupled with broad-spectrum antibiotics, remains the cornerstone of treatment. Delays in surgical management significantly increase mortality, emphasizing the importance of prompt diagnosis and intervention. This case underscores the necessity for heightened awareness among healthcare providers to recognize NF promptly, especially when its clinical presentation overlaps with other critical conditions. Multidisciplinary collaboration and continued education are imperative to improve outcomes and prevent delays in the diagnosis and treatment of NF."

We aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of DFC versus immediate fascial closure (IFC) in EGS patients with intra-abdominal contamination. This retrospective study was conducted using the 2013-2020 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Adult EGS patients who underwent an exploratory laparotomy with intra-abdominal contamination [wound classification III (contaminated) or IV (dirty)] were included. Patients with agreed upon indications for DFC were excluded. A propensity-matched analysis was performed. The primary outcome was 30-d mortality. We identified 36,974 eligible patients. 16.8% underwent DFC, of which 51.7% were female, and the median age was 64 y. After matching, there were 6213 pairs. DFC was associated with a higher risk of mortality (15.8% versus 14.2%, P = 0.016), pneumonia (11.7% versus 10.1%, P = 0.007), pulmonary embolism (1.9% versus 1.6%, P = 0.03), and longer hospital stay (11 versus 10 d, P < 0.001). No significant differences in postoperative sepsis and deep surgical site infection rates between the two groups were observed. Subgroup analyses by preoperative diagnosis (diverticulitis, perforation, and undifferentiated sepsis) showed that DFC was associated with longer hospital stay in all subgroups, with a higher mortality rate in patients with diverticulitis (8.1% versus 6.1%, P = 0.027). In the presence of intra-abdominal contamination, DFC is associated with longer hospital stay and higher rates of mortality and morbidity. DFC was not associated with decreased risk of infectious complications. Further studies are needed to clearly define the indications of DFC."

    "abstract": "Vascular surgeons work long, unpredictable hours with repeated exposure to high-stress situations. Inspired by general surgery acute care surgery models, we sought to organize the care of vascular emergencies with the implementation of a vascular acute care surgery (VACS) model. Within this model, a surgeon is in-house without elective cases and assigned for consultations and urgent operative cases on a weekly basis. This study examined the impact of a VACS model on postoperative mortality and surgeon efficiency. This was a retrospective cohort analysis of institutional Vascular Quality Initiative data from July 2014 to July 2023. Patients undergoing lower extremity bypass, peripheral vascular intervention, or amputation were included. There was a washout period from January 2020 to January 2022 to account for COVID-19 pandemic practice abnormalities. Patients were separated into pre- or post-VACS groups. The primary clinical outcomes were 30-day and 2-year mortality. Secondary clinical outcomes included 30-day complications and 30-day and 1-year major adverse limb events (MALE). Separate analyses of operating room data from July 2017 to February 2024 and fiscal data from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2024 were conducted. A washout period from January 2020 to January 2022 was applied. Efficiency outcomes included monthly relative value units (RVUs) per clinical fraction full-time equivalent (cFTE) and daytime (0730-1700, Monday-Friday) operating room minutes. Patient factors and operative efficiency were compared using appropriate statistical tests. Regression modeling was performed for the primary outcomes. There were 972 and 257 patients in the pre- and post-VACS groups, respectively. Pre-VACS patients were younger (66.8 ± 12.0 vs 68.7 ± 12.7 years; P = .03) with higher rates of coronary artery disease (34.6% vs 14.8%; P < .01), hypertension (88.4% vs 82.2%; P = .01), and tobacco history (84.4% vs 78.2%; P = .02). Thirty-day mortality (2.4% pre-vs 0.8% post-VACS; P = .18) and Kaplan-Meier estimation of 2-year mortality remained stable after VACS (P = .07). VACS implementation was not associated with 30-day mortality but was associated with lower 2-year mortality hazard on multivariable Cox regression (hazard ratio [HR], 0.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.3-0.9; P = .01). Operative efficiency improved post-VACS (median, 850.0; interquartile range [IQR], 765.7-916.3 vs median, 918.0; IQR, 881.0-951.1 RVU/cFTE-month; P = .03). Daytime operating minutes increased (469.1 ± 287.5 vs 908.2 ± 386.2 minutes; P < .01), whereas non-daytime minutes (420.0; IQR, 266.0-654.0 vs 469.5; IQR, 242.0-738.3 minutes; P = .40) and weekend minutes (129.0; IQR, 0.0-298.0 vs 113.5; IQR, 0.0-279.5 minutes; P = .59) remained stable. A VACS model leads to improvement in surgeon operative efficiency while maintaining patient safety. The adoption of a vascular acute care model has a positive impact on the delivery of comprehensive vascular care."

    "abstract": "The rupture of splenic artery pseudoaneurysm (SAP) is life-threatening disease, often caused by trauma and pancreatitis. SAPs often rupture into the abdominal cavity and rarely into the stomach. A 70-year-old male with no previous medical history was transported to our emergency center with transient loss of consciousness and tarry stools. After admission, the patient become hemodynamically unstable and his upper abdomen became markedly distended. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography performed on admission showed the presence of a splenic artery aneurysm (SAP) at the bottom of a gastric ulcer. Based on the clinical picture and evidence on explorative tests, we established a preliminary diagnosis of ruptured SAP bleeding into the stomach and performed emergency laparotomy. Intraoperative findings revealed the presence of a large intra-abdominal hematoma that had ruptured into the stomach. When we performed gastrotomy at the anterior wall of the stomach from the ruptured area, we found pulsatile bleeding from the exposed SAP; therefore, the SAP was ligated from inside of the stomach, with gauze packing into the ulcer. We temporarily closed the stomach wall and performed open abdomen management, as a damage control surgery (DCS) approach. On the third day of admission, total gastrectomy and splenectomy were performed, and reconstruction surgery was performed the next day. Histopathological studies of the stomach samples indicated the presence of moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma. Since no malignant cells were found at the rupture site, we concluded that the gastric rupture was caused by increased internal pressure due to the intra-abdominal hematoma. We successfully treated a patient with intragastric rupture of the SAP that was caused by gastric cancer invasion, accompanied by gastric rupture, by performing DCS. When treating gastric bleeding, such rare causes must be considered and appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic strategies should be designed according to the cause of bleeding."

    "title": "Emergency general surgery in older adult patients: Factors associated with fragmented care.",
    "abstract": "Care fragmentation has been shown to lead to increased morbidity and mortality. We aimed to explore the factors related to care fragmentation after hospital discharge in geriatric emergency general surgery patients, as well as examine the association between care fragmentation and mortality. We designed a retrospective study of the Nationwide Readmissions Database 2019. We included patients ≥65 years old admitted with an emergency general surgery diagnosis who were discharged alive from the index admission. The primary outcome was 90-day care fragmentation, defined as an unplanned readmission to a non-index hospital. Multivariable logistic regression was performed, adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics. A total of 447,027 older adult emergency general surgery patients were included; the main diagnostic category was colorectal (22.6%), and 78.2% of patients underwent non-operative management during the index hospitalization. By 90 days post-discharge, 189,622 (24.3%) patients had an unplanned readmission. Of those readmitted, 20.8% had care fragmentation. The median age of patients with care fragmentation was 76 years, and 53.2% were of female sex. Predictors of care fragmentation were living in rural counties (odds ratio 1.76, 95% confidence interval: 1.57-1.97), living in a low-income ZIP Code, discharge to intermediate care facility (odds ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval: 1.22-1.33), initial non-operative management (odds ratio 1.17, 95% confidence interval: 1.12-1.23), leaving against medical advice (odds ratio 2.60, 95% confidence interval: 2.29-2.96), and discharge from private investor-owned hospitals (odds ratio 1.18, 95% confidence interval: 1.10-1.27). Care fragmentation was significantly associated with higher mortality. The burden of unplanned readmissions in older adult patients who survive an emergency general surgery admission is underestimated, and these patients frequently experience care fragmentation. Future directions should prioritize evaluating the impact of initiatives aimed at alleviating the incidence and complications of care fragmentation in geriatric emergency general surgery patients."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery performed among patients over 65 years of age represents a particularly high-risk population. Although interhospital transfer has been linked to higher mortality in emergency general surgery patients, its impact on outcomes in the geriatric population remains uncertain. We aimed to establish the effect of interhospital transfer on postoperative outcomes in geriatric emergency general surgery patients. Emergency general surgery patients 65 years and older were identified with American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program 2013 to 2019. Patients were categorized based on admission source as either directly admitted or transferred from an outside hospital inpatient unit or emergency department. The primary outcomes evaluated were in-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, and overall morbidity. Propensity score matching was used to control for confounders, including age, race, comorbidities, and preoperative conditions. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and the log-rank test were used to compare 30-day survival in the matched cohort. Among the 88,424 patients identified, 13,872 (15.7%) were transfer patients. The median age was 74, and 53% were of female sex. Transfer patients had higher rates of comorbidities and preoperative conditions, including a higher prevalence of preoperative sepsis (21.8% vs 19.3%, P < .001) and ventilator dependence (6.4% vs 2.6%, P < .001). After propensity score-matched analysis, transferred patients exhibited higher rates of in-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, and overall morbidity. Transfer patients were also less likely to be discharged home and more likely to be discharged to an acute care facility. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis confirmed a poorer 30-day survival in transferred patients. Interhospital transfer independently contributed to overall mortality and morbidity amongst geriatric emergency general surgery patients. Further investigation into improved coordination between hospitals, tailored care plans, and comprehensive risk assessments are needed to help mitigate the observed differences in outcomes."

    "title": "Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities in Complex Abdominal Wall Reconstruction Referrals.",
    "abstract": "Background: Health disparities are pervasive in surgical care. Particularly racial and socioeconomic inequalities have been demonstrated in emergency general surgery outcomes, but less so in elective abdominal wall reconstruction (AWR). The goal of this study was to evaluate the disparities in referrals to a tertiary hernia center. Methods: A prospectively maintained hernia database was queried for patients who underwent open ventral hernia (OVHR) or minimally invasive surgical (MISR) repair from 2011 to 2022 with complete insurance and address information. Patients were divided by home address into in-state (IS) and out-of-state (OOS) referrals as well as by operative technique. Demographic data and outcomes were compared. Standard and inferential statistical analyses were performed. Results: Of 554 patients, most were IS (59.0%); 334 underwent OVHR, and 220 underwent MISR. IS patients were more likely to undergo MISR (OVHR: 45.6% vs. 81.5%, laparoscopic: 38.2% vs. 14.1%, robotic: 16.2% vs. 4.4%; p < 0.001) when compared to OOS referrals. Of OVHR patients, 44.6% were IS and 55.4% were OOS. Patients' average age and BMI, sex, ASA score, and insurance payer were similar between IS and OOS groups. IS patients were more often Black (White: 77.9% vs. 93.5%, Black: 16.8% vs. 4.3%; p < 0.001). IS patients had more smokers (12.1% vs. 3.2%; p = 0.001), fewer recurrent hernias (45.0% vs. 69.7%; p < 0.001), and smaller defects (155.7 ± 142.2 vs. 256.4 ± 202.9 cm2; p < 0.001). Wound class, mesh type, and rate of fascial closure were similar, but IS patients underwent fewer panniculectomies (13.4% vs. 34.1%; p < 0.001), component separations (26.2% vs. 51.4%; p < 0.001), received smaller mesh (744.2 ± 495.6 vs. 975.7 ± 442.3 cm2; p < 0.001), and had shorter length-of-stay (4.8 ± 2.0 vs. 7.0 ± 5.5 days; p < 0.001). There was no difference in wound breakdown, seroma requiring intervention, hematoma, mesh infection, or recurrence; however, IS patients had decreased wound infections (2.0% vs. 8.6%; p = 0.009), overall wound complications (11.4% vs. 21.1%; p = 0.016), readmissions (2.7% vs. 13.0%; p = 0.001), and reoperations (3.4% vs. 11.4%; p = 0.007). Of MISR patients, 80.9% were IS and 19.1% were OOS. In contrast to OVHR, MISR IS and OOS patients had similar demographics, preoperative characteristics, intraoperative details, and postoperative outcomes. Conclusion: Although there were no differences in referred patients for MISR, this study demonstrates the racial disparities that exist among our IS and OOS complex, open AWR patients. Awareness of these disparities can help clinicians work towards equitable access to care and equal referrals to tertiary hernia centers."

    "abstract": "Adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is a leading cause of hospitalization in emergency surgery. The occurrence of bowel ischemia significantly increases the morbidity and mortality rates associated with this condition. Current clinical, biochemical and radiological parameters have poor predictive value for bowel ischemia. This study is designed to ascertain predictive elements for the progression to bowel ischemia in patients diagnosed with non-strangulated ASBO who are initially managed through conservative therapeutic approaches. The study was based on the previously collected medical records of 128 patients admitted to the Department of Acute Care Surgery of Padua General Hospital, from August 2020 to April 2023, with a diagnosis of non-strangulated adhesive small bowel obstruction, who were then operated for failure of conservative treatment. The presence or absence of bowel ischemia was used to distinguish the two populations. Clinical, biochemical and radiological data were used to verify whether there is a correlation with the detection of bowel ischemia. We found that a Neutrophil-Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) > 6.8 (OR 2.9; 95% CI 1.41-6.21), the presence of mesenteric haziness (OR 2.56; 95% CI 1.11-5.88), decreased wall enhancement (OR 4.3; 95% CI 3.34-10.9) and free abdominal fluid (OR 2.64; 95% CI 1.08-6.16) were significantly associated with bowel ischemia at univariate analysis. At the multivariate logistic regression analysis, only NLR > 6.8 (OR 5.9; 95% CI 2.2-18.6) remained independent predictive factor for small bowel ischemia in non-strangulated adhesive small bowel obstruction, with 78% sensitivity and 65% specificity. NLR is a straightforward and reproducible parameter to predict bowel ischemia in cases of non-strangulated adhesive small bowel obstruction. Employing NLR during reevaluation of patients with this condition, who were initially treated conservatively, can help the acute care surgeons in the early prediction of bowel ischemia onset."

    "abstract": "Robotic surgery has gained widespread acceptance in elective interventions, yet its role in emergency procedures remains underexplored. While the 2021 WSES position paper discussed limited studies on the application of robotics in emergency general surgery, it recommended strict patient selection, adequate training, and improved platform accessibility. This prospective study aims to define the role of robotic surgery in emergency settings, evaluating intraoperative and postoperative outcomes and assessing its feasibility and safety. The ROEM study is an observational, prospective, multicentre, international analysis of clinically stable adult patients undergoing robotic surgery for emergency treatment of acute pathologies including diverticulitis, cholecystitis, and obstructed hernias. Data collection includes patient demographics and intervention details. Furthermore, data relating to the operating theatre team and the surgical instruments used will be collected in order to conduct a cost analysis. The study plans to enrol at least 500 patients from 50 participating centres, with each centre having a local lead and collaborators. All data will be collected and stored online through a secure server running the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) web application. Ethical considerations and data governance will be paramount, requiring local ethical committee approvals from participating centres. Current literature and expert consensus suggest the feasibility of robotic surgery in emergencies with proper support. However, challenges include staff training, scheduling conflicts with elective surgeries, and increased costs. The ROEM study seeks to contribute valuable data on the safety, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of robotic surgery in emergency settings, focusing on specific pathologies. Previous studies on cholecystitis, abdominal hernias, and diverticulitis provide insights into the benefits and challenges of robotic approaches. It is necessary to identify patient populations that benefit most from robotic emergency surgery to optimize outcomes and justify costs."

Portal venous gas on imaging in the setting of peritonitis and sepsis is one such finding. Thyrotoxicosis on the other hand is an uncommon diagnosis that is associated with non-specific symptoms resulting in delayed diagnosis, a clinical scenario that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Here, we present a rare case of a patient who presented with signs and symptoms of peritonitis and portal venous gas on CT scan that was taken emergently to the operating room. No intraabdominal pathology was identified. The patient was later diagnosed with thyrotoxicosis, the presumed cause of the acute abdomen presentation."

    "abstract": "Over the past 2 decades, the use and importance of robotic surgery in minimally invasive surgery has increased. Across various surgical specialties, robotic technology has gained popularity through its use of 3D visualization, optimal ergonomic positioning, and precise instrument manipulation. This growing interest has also been seen in acute care surgery, where laparoscopic procedures are used more frequently. Despite the growing popularity of robotic surgery in the acute care surgical realm, there is very little research on the utility of robotics regarding its effects on health outcomes and cost-effectiveness. The current literature indicates some value in utilizing robotic technology in specific urgent procedures, such as cholecystectomies and incarcerated hernia repairs; however, the high cost of robotic surgery was found to be a potential barrier to its widespread use in acute care surgery. This narrative literature review aims to determine the cost-effectiveness of robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) in surgical procedures that are often done in urgent settings: cholecystectomies, inguinal hernia repair, ventral hernia repair, and appendectomies."

    "abstract": "The COVID pandemic has necessitated mask-wearing by inpatient providers; however, the impact of masks on the acute care surgeon-patient relationship is unknown. We hypothesized that mask-wearing, while necessary, has a negative impact by acting as a barrier to communication, empathy, and trust between patients and surgeons. A cross-sectional study was performed by administering a written survey in English or Spanish to trauma, emergency general surgery, burn, and surgical critical care inpatients aged ≥18 y at a University Level 1 Trauma Center between January 2023 and June 2023. Patients were asked seven questions about their perception of mask effect on interactions with their surgery providers. Responses were scored on a five-point Likert scale and binarized for multivariable logistic regression. There were 188 patients who completed the survey. The patients were 68% male, 44% Hispanic, and 17% Spanish speaking, with a median age of 45-54 y. A third of patients agreed that surgeon mask-wearing made it harder to understand the details of their surgical procedure and made them less comfortable in giving consent. Twenty three percent agreed that it was harder to trust their provider; increasing age was associated with lower levels of trust, odds ratio 1.36 (confidence interval 1.10-1.71, P = 0.006). Findings were consistent among patients of different sex, race/ethnicity, language, and pre-COVID hospital experience. Mask-wearing, while important, has a negative impact on the patient-surgeon relationship in trauma and acute care surgery. Providers must be conscious of this effect while wearing masks and strive to optimize communication with patients to ensure high-quality trauma-informed care."

    "abstract": "Social determinants of health are increasingly recognized to shape health outcomes. Yet, the effect of socioeconomic vulnerability on outcomes after emergency general surgery remains under-studied. All adult (≥18 years) hospitalizations for emergency general surgery operations (appendectomy, cholecystectomy, laparotomy, large bowel resection, perforated ulcer repair, or small bowel resection), within 2 days of non-elective admission were tabulated in the 2016 to 2020 Nationwide Readmissions Database. Socioeconomic vulnerability was defined using relevant diagnosis codes and comprised economic, educational, healthcare, environmental, and social needs. Patients demonstrating socioeconomic vulnerability were considered Vulnerable (others: Non-Vulnerable). Multivariable models were constructed to evaluate the independent associations between socioeconomic vulnerability and key outcomes. Of ∼1,788,942 patients, 177,764 (9.9%) were considered Vulnerable. Compared to Non-Vulnerable, Vulnerable patients were older (67 [55-77] vs 58 years [41-70), P < .001), more often insured by Medicaid (16.4 vs 12.7%, P < .001), and had a higher Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (4 [3-5] vs 2 [1-3], P < .001). After risk adjustment and with Non-Vulnerable as a reference, Vulnerable remained linked with a greater likelihood of in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio 1.64, confidence interval 1.58-1.70) and any perioperative complication (adjusted odds ratio 2.02, confidence interval 1.98-2.06). Vulnerable also experienced a greater duration of stay (β+4.64 days, confidence interval +4.54-4.74) and hospitalization costs (β+$1,360, confidence interval +980-1,740). Further, the Vulnerable cohort demonstrated increased odds of non-home discharge (adjusted odds ratio 2.44, confidence interval 2.38-2.50) and non-elective readmission within 30 days of discharge (adjusted odds ratio 1.29, confidence interval 1.26-1.32). Socioeconomic vulnerability is independently associated with greater morbidity, resource use, and readmission after emergency general surgery. Novel interventions are needed to build hospital screening and care pathways to improve disparities in outcomes."

    "abstract": "Vascular surgeons have one of the highest rates of burnout among surgical specialties, often attributed to high patient acuity and clinical workload. Acute Care Surgery models are a potential solution used among general and trauma surgeons. This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education survey results from faculty and residents before and after implementation of a vascular Acute Care Surgery (VACS) model. The VACS model assigns a weekly rotation of an attending surgeon with no elective cases or clinic responsibilities and a monthly rotating resident team. Residents and attendings are in-house to cover all urgent and emergent vascular daytime consultations and procedures, whereas nights and weekend coverage remain a typical rotating schedule. Survey question results were binned into domains consistent with the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Both residents and faculty reported an increase in median scores in Maslach Burnout Inventory domains of emotional exhaustion (Faculty: 2.9 vs 3.4; P < .001; Residents: 3.1 vs 3.6; P < .001) and faculty reported higher personal accomplishment scores (Faculty: 3.3 vs 3.8; P = .005) after the VACS model implementation. A VACS model is a tangible practice change that can address a major problem for current vascular surgeons, as it is associated with decreased burnout for faculty and residents through improvement in both emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment. Improved longitudinal assessment of resident and faculty burnout is needed and future work should identify specific practice patterns related to decreased burnout."

However, there is no clear consensus on the appropriated timing of surgery for gastrointestinal perforation. We investigated association between wait time and surgical outcomes in emergency abdominal surgery. This single-center retrospective cohort study evaluated adult patients who underwent emergency surgery for gastrointestinal perforations between January 2003 and September 2021. Risk-adjusted restricted cubic splines modeled the probability of each mortality according to wait time. The inflection point when mortality began to increase was used to define early and late surgery. Outcomes among propensity-score matched early and late surgical patients were compared using percent absolute risk differences (RDs, with 95% CIs). Mortality rates began to rise after 16 h of waiting. However, early and late surgery groups showed no significant differences in 30-day mortality (11.4% vs. 5.7%), ICU stay duration (4.3 ± 7.5 vs. 4.3 ± 5.2 days), or total hospital stay (17.4 ± 17.0 vs. 24.7 ± 23.4 days). Notably, patients waiting over 16 h had a significantly higher ICU readmission rate (8.6% vs. 31.4%). The APACHE II score was a significant predictor of 30-day mortality. Although we were unable to reveal significant differences in mortality in the subgroup analysis, we were able to find an inflection point of 16 h through the RCS curve technique. Formal consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study, and ethical approval was obtained from the institutional research committee of our institution (B-2110-714-107) on 6 October 2021."

Some have advocated for the sub-specialization of emergency general surgery independent from trauma. We hypothesized inferior clinical outcomes of emergency general surgery with increasing center-level operative trauma volume, potentially attributable to overall hospital quality. Adults (≥18 years) undergoing complex emergency general surgery operations (large and small bowel resection, repair of perforated peptic ulcer, lysis of adhesions, laparotomy) were identified in the 2016 to 2020 Nationwide Readmissions Database. Multivariable risk-adjusted models were developed to evaluate the association of treatment at a high-volume trauma center (reference: low-volume trauma center) with clinical and financial outcomes after emergency general surgery. To evaluate hospital quality, mortality among adult hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction was assessed by hospital trauma volume. Of an estimated 785,793 patients undergoing a complex emergency general surgery operation, 223,116 (28.4%) were treated at a high-volume trauma center. Treatment at a high-volume trauma center was linked to 1.19 odds of in-hospital mortality (95% confidence interval 1.12-1.27). Although emergency general surgery volume was associated with decreasing predicted risk of mortality, increasing trauma volume was linked to an incremental rise in the odds of mortality after emergency general surgery. Secondary analysis revealed increased mortality for admissions for acute myocardial infarction with greater trauma volume. We note increased mortality for emergency general surgery and acute myocardial infarction in patients receiving treatment at high-volume trauma centers, signifying underlying structural factors to broadly affect quality. Thus, decoupling trauma and emergency general surgery services may not meaningfully improve outcomes for emergency general surgery patients. Our findings have implications for the evolving specialty of emergency general surgery, especially for the safety and continued growth of the acute care surgery model."

There are no objective tools to predict mortality at the time of interhospital transfer for Emergency General Surgery patients that are \"unseen\" by the accepting system. Patients transferred to general or colorectal surgery services from January 2016 to August 2022 were retrospectively identified and randomly divided into training and validation cohorts (3:1 ratio). The primary outcome was admission-related mortality, defined as death during the index admission or within 30 days postdischarge. Multiple predictive models were developed and validated. Among 4664 transferred patients, 280 (6.0%) experienced mortality. Predictive models were generated utilizing 19 routinely collected variables; the penalized regression model was selected over other models due to excellent performance using only 12 variables. The model performance on the validating set resulted in an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, and balanced accuracy of 0.851, 0.90, 0.67, and 0.79, respectively. After bias correction, the Brier score was 0.04, indicating a strong association between the assigned risk and the observed frequency of mortality. A risk calculator using 12 variables has excellent predictive ability for mortality at the time of interhospital transfer among \"unseen\" Emergency General Surgery patients. Quantifying a patient's mortality risk at the time of transfer could improve patient triage, bed and resource allocation, and standardize care."

Patient satisfaction in emergency surgical units is often low due to poor communication with attendees and long wait times. A pilot patient questionnaire identified areas where patient satisfaction was low during attendance at the surgical assessment unit (SAU). The aim of this intervention was to improve patient satisfaction with their experience whilst attending the SAU. An education video was filmed to address the areas where services were falling short of expectations, and this was played in the waiting room. Further questionnaire results tailored the frequency of the video to achieve maximum impact. Data were collected at three time points: firstly, prior to the introduction of the video (n=34); secondly, with the video played hourly (n=15); and finally with the video played every 30 minutes at a higher volume (n=15). Mean satisfaction scores after the final cycle improved to 7.3 from 4.9 (p=0.0009). Additionally, 94% of patients agreed that the video was in keeping with their personal experience of the SAU and agreed that the video improved their understanding of what to expect from the visit. Interventions that improve communication with patients and adjust their expectations play an important role in improving patient satisfaction and their overall perception of care.

The objective of this study was to derive and validate a clinical risk index score, NECROSIS, for identifying NSTIs in emergency general surgery (EGS) patients being evaluated for severe skin and soft tissue infections. We performed a prospective study across 16 sites in the United States of adult EGS patients with suspected NSTIs over a 30-month period. Variables analyzed included demographics, admission vitals and laboratories, physical examination, radiographic, and operative findings. The main outcome measure was the presence of NSTI diagnosed clinically at the time of surgery. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent predictors for the presence of NSTI using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and the Akaike information criteria. Of 362 patients, 297 (82%) were diagnosed with an NSTI. Overall mortality was 12.3%. Multivariate analysis identified three independent predictors for NSTI: systolic blood pressure of ≤120 mm Hg, violaceous skin, and white blood cell count of ≥15 × 10 3 /μL. Multivariate modeling demonstrated Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit ( p = 0.9) with a c statistic for the prediction curve of 0.75. Test characteristics of the NECROSIS score were similar between the derivation and validation cohorts. NECROSIS is a simple and potentially useful clinical index score for identifying at-risk EGS patients with NSTIs. Future validation studies are warranted. Diagnostic Tests or Criteria; Level III."

We aimed to (1) characterize time-to-operation patterns among EGS procedures and (2) test the association between timing and patient outcomes. We hypothesize that patients receiving later operations are at greater risk for mortality and morbidity. We performed a retrospective cohort study of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data for adults aged 18 to 89 years who underwent nonelective intra-abdominal operations (appendectomy, cholecystectomy, small bowel resection, lysis of adhesions, and colectomy) from 2015 to 2020. The primary outcome was 30-day postoperative mortality. Secondary outcomes were serious morbidity and all morbidity. Admission-to-operation timing was calculated and classified as early (≤48 hours) or late (>48 hours). A multivariable logistic regression model adjusted risk estimates for age, comorbidities, frailty (Modified Frailty Index, 5-item score), and other confounders. Of 269,959 patients (mean age, 47.0 years; 48.0% male, 61.6% White), 88.7% underwent early operation, ranging from 70.36% (lysis of adhesions) to 98.67% (appendectomy). Unadjusted 30-day mortality was higher for late versus early operation (6.73% vs. 1.96%; p < 0.0001). After risk adjustment, late operation significantly increased risk for 30-day mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.545; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.451-1.644), serious morbidity (OR, 1.464; 95% CI, 1.416-1.514), and all morbidity (OR, 1.468; 95% CI, 1.417-1.520). This mortality risk persisted for all EGS procedures; risk of serious and any morbidity persisted for all procedures except cholecystectomy. Late operation significantly increased risk for 30-day mortality, serious morbidity, and all morbidity across a variety of EGS procedures. We believe that these findings will inform decisions regarding timing of EGS operations and allocation of surgical resources. Therapeutic/Care Management; Level III."

    "abstract": "Identifying patients who can be safely managed in lower-level trauma centers is critical to avoid overburdening level I centers. This study examines the transfer patterns and outcomes of blunt splenic injury (BSI) patients cared for at 2 regional level III trauma centers as compared to an associated level I center. A retrospective cohort study was conducted including all trauma patients with BSI admitted to 2 level III trauma centers (TC3) and a level I center (TC1) between 2012 and 2022. Patients were broken into 3 categories: TC1, TC3, and transfer patients (transferred from TC3 to TC1). A total of 1480 patients were admitted to TC1, 208 patients to TC3, and 128 were transferred. 22.7% of transfer patients were children. No difference in splenic injury grade was seen between patients managed at TC1 and TC3. Patients presenting to TC1 had more severe concomitant injuries. Patients underwent urgent splenectomy at similar rates at TC1 and TC3 (15.1 vs 18.7%, P = .1). Successful nonoperative management was achieved at similar rates (81.3 vs 75.5%, P = .1). When controlling for ISS and ED disposition, there was no significant difference in length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, and inpatient mortality between TC1 and TC3. Level III centers effectively managed BSI achieving comparable outcomes to the level 1 center. Transfers commonly occurred in pediatric and multisystem trauma patients, though high-grade splenic injuries were not predictive of transfer. High-grade BSI can be safely managed at level III centers without need for transfer."

    "abstract": "The direct association between procedure risk and outcomes in elderly patients who undergo emergency general surgery (EGS) has not been analyzed. Studies only highlight the importance of frailty. A comprehensive analysis of relevant risk factors and their association with outcomes in elderly patients who undergo EGS is lacking. We hypothesized that procedure risk has a stronger association with relevant outcomes in elderly patients who undergo EGS compared with frailty. Elderly patients (age >65 years) undergoing EGS operative procedures were identified in the NSQIP database (2018 to 2020) and stratified based on the presence of frailty calculated by the Modified 5-Item Frailty Index (mFI-5; mFI 0 nonfrail, mFI 1 to 2 frail, and mFI ≥3 severely frail) and based on procedure risk. Multivariable regression models and receiving operative curve analysis were used to determine risk factors associated with outcomes. A total of 59,633 elderly patients who underwent EGS were classified into nonfrail (17,496; 29.3%), frail (39,588; 66.4%), and severely frail (2,549; 4.3%). There were 25,157 patients in the low-risk procedure group and 34,476 in the high-risk group. Frailty and procedure risk were associated with increased mortality, complications, failure to rescue, and readmissions. Differences in outcomes were greater when patients were stratified according to procedure risk compared with frailty stratification alone. Procedure risk had a stronger association with relevant outcomes in elderly patients who underwent EGS compared with frailty. Assessing frailty in the population of elderly patients who undergo EGS without adjusting for the type of procedure or procedure risk ultimately presents an incomplete representation of how frailty impacts patient-related outcomes."

    "abstract": "We have recently shown that readmission after EGS procedures carries a 4-fold higher mortality rate when compared to those not readmitted. Understanding factors associated with death after readmission is paramount to improving outcomes for EGS patients. We aimed to identify risk factors contributing to failure-to-rescue (FTR) during readmission after EGS. We hypothesized that most post-readmission deaths in EGS are attributable to FTR. A retrospective cohort study using the NSQIP database 2013-2019 was performed. Patients who underwent 1 of 9 urgent/emergent surgical procedures representing 80% of EGS burden of disease, who were readmitted within 30 days post-procedure were identified. The procedures were classified as low- and high-risk. Patient characteristics analyzed included age, sex, BMI, ASA score comorbidities, postoperative complications, frailty, and FTR. The population was assessed for risk factors associated with mortality and FTR by uni- and multivariate logistic regression. Of 312,862 EGS cases, 16,306 required readmission. Of those, 10,748 (3.4%) developed a postoperative complication. Overall mortality after readmission was 2.4%, with 90.6% of deaths attributable to FTR. Frailty, high-risk procedures, pulmonary complications, AKI, sepsis, and the need for reoperation increased the risk of FTR. Death after a complication is common in EGS readmissions. The impact of FTR could be minimized with the implementation of measures to allow early identification and intervention or prevention of infectious, respiratory, and renal complications."

    "abstract": "Robotic surgery was first introduced in the 1980s as a system to aid patients in the battlefield. Since then, robotic surgery has become an important minimally invasive tool and plays an important role in elective surgery among various surgical specialties. However, the role for robotic surgery in the emergent setting is not well established or studied. Robotic surgery has been shown to be advantageous to both patients and operating surgeons. Though limited, studies have found robotic surgery in the acute setting to be safe for patients. These studies found robotic surgery to have improved perioperative outcomes when compared to an open or laparoscopic approach. Additionally, the robotic platform is thought to be an effective tool to prevent conversion to open procedures in emergent settings. Although some studies demonstrate advantages to robotic acute surgery, others have shown increased complications with robotic acute surgery or no distinct advantage when comparing robotic to laparoscopic surgery. Additionally, some of the published papers supporting the use of robotic surgery in the emergent setting may have a degree of bias favoring the robotic platform. Robotic surgery is a mainstay in minimally invasive elective surgery and gaining popularity among patients and surgeons. There are pros and cons to the adaptation of the robotic platform in the acute care setting. Additional large population studies are indicated to determine the true role of the robotic platform in the emergent setting."

    "abstract": "Trauma and acute care surgeons commonly perform high acuity and emergent interventions on critically ill or injured patients. This often entails making life or death decisions rapidly and with incomplete and imperfect information, and in patients who may have a variety of comorbidities that contribute to the risk of adverse outcomes. In cases where there are real or perceived breaches of care, a medical malpractice claim may result. In the USA, approximately one-third to one-half of all physicians will be named in medical litigation at least once in their career. Among the various specialties, surgery remains among the highest risk for malpractice litigation, at an average of 10.6 defendants per 100 surgeons. These events can be extremely stressful, demoralizing, or even devastating to the career and well-being of the involved physicians. This can be made better or worse by the individual response and actions of the surgeon on notification of a real or potential claim, and the primary goal of this review is to highlight these key areas and optimal strategies in malpractice scenarios. This includes strategies to manage the initial receipt of a malpractice claim, subsequent courses of action, and advice for incorporating preventive measures into everyday practice."

    "abstract": "Patients undergoing emergency general surgery are at high risk of complications and death. Our objectives were to estimate the incidence of emergency general surgery in a Swiss University Hospital, to describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients undergoing such procedures, and to study the impact of age on clinical outcomes. This was a retrospective cohort study of adult patients who visited the emergency department (ED) of Geneva University Hospitals between January 2015 and December 2019. Routinely collected data were extracted from electronic medical records. The primary outcome was the incidence of emergency general surgery among patients visiting the emergency department, defined as general surgery within three days of emergency department admission. We also assessed demographic characteristics, mortality, intensive care unit admission and patient disposition. Multivariable log-binomial regression was used to study the associations of age with intensive care unit (ICU) admission, one-year mortality and dependence at discharge. Age was modelled as a continuous variable using restricted cubic splines and we compared older patients (75th percentile) with younger patients (25th percentile). Between January 2015 and December 2019, a total of 310,914 emergency department visits met our inclusion criteria. Among them, 3592 patients underwent emergency general surgery within 3 days of emergency department admission, yielding an annual incidence of 116 events per 10,000 emergency department visits (95% CI: 112-119), with a higher incidence in females and young patients. Overall, 5.3% of patients were admitted to ICU, 7.8% were dependent on rehabilitation or assisted living at discharge and 4.8% were dead after one year. Older patients had a higher risk of ICU admission (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 2.9 [1.5-5.4]), dependence at discharge (aRR 15.3 [5.5-42.4]) and one-year mortality (aRR 5.4 [2.2-13.4]). Emergency department visits resulting in emergency general surgery are frequent, but their incidence decreases with patient age. Mortality, ICU admission and dependence at discharge following emergency general surgery are more frequent in older patients. Taking into account the increased risk for older patients, a shared process is appropriate for making more informed decisions about their options for care."

    "abstract": "To determine the association between postdischarge mental health care and odds of readmission after emergency general surgery (EGS) hospitalization for patients with serious mental illness (SMI). A mental health visit (MHV) after medical hospitalization is associated with decreased readmissions for patients with SMI. The impact of a MHV after surgical hospitalization is unknown. Using Medicare claims, we performed a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized EGS patients with SMI aged above 65.5 (2016-2018). EGS included colorectal, general abdominal, hepatopancreatobiliary, hernia, intestinal obstruction, resuscitation, and upper gastrointestinal conditions. SMI was defined as schizophrenia spectrum, mood, or anxiety disorders. The exposure was MHV within 30 days of discharge. The primary outcome was 30-day readmission. Secondary outcomes included emergency department presentation and psychiatric admission. Inverse probability weighting was used to evaluated outcomes. Of 88,092 analyzed patients, 11,755 (13.3%) had a MHV within 30 days of discharge. 23,696 (26.9%) of patients were managed operatively, 64,395 (73.1%) nonoperatively. After adjustment for potential confounders, patients with a postdischarge MHV had lower odds of acute care readmission than patients without a MHV in both operative (OR=0.60; 95% CI: 0.40-0.90) and nonoperative (OR=0.67; 95% CI: 0.53-0.84) cohorts. There was no association between postdischarge MHV and ED presentation or psychiatric admission in the operative or nonoperative groups. Postdischarge MHV after EGS hospitalization was associated with decreased odds of readmission for patients with SMI managed operatively and nonoperatively. In older EGS patients with SMI, coordination of MHVs may be a mechanism to reduce readmission disparities."

Longitudinal cohort study at a tertiary center. The local protocol, promoted, created, and periodically revised by the Acute Care Surgery Unit (ACSu) was updated and approved on March 2019. A specific registry was prospectively fulfilled with demographics, comorbidity, type of presentation, diagnostic items, therapeutic decision, and clinical course, considering both non-operative management (NOM) or cholecystectomy, early and delayed (EC and DC). Phase 1: April 2019-April 2021. A critical analysis and a surgical audit with the participation of all the involved Departments were then performed, especially focusing on improving global EC rate, considered primary outcome. Phase 2: May 2021-May 2023. Software SPSS 23.0 was used to compare data between phases. Initial EC rate was significantly higher on Phase 2 (39.3%vs52.5%, p < 0.004), as a significantly inferior rate of patients were initially bailed out from EC to NOM because of comorbidity (14.4%vs8%, p < 0.02) and grade II with severe inflammatory signs (7%vs3%, p < 0.04). A higher percentage of patients was recovered for EC after an initial decision of NOM on Phase 2, but without reaching statistical significance (21.8%vs29.2%, n.s.). Global EC rate significantly increased between phases (52.5%vs66.3%, p < 0.002) without increasing morbidity and mortality. A significant minor percentage of elective cholecystectomies after AC episodes had to be performed on Phase 2 (14%vs6.7%, p < 0.009). Complex EC and those indicated after readmission or NOM failure were usually performed by the ACSu staff. To adequately follow up the implementation of a local protocol for AC healthcare, registering and periodically analyzing data allow to perform intermediate surgical audits, useful to improve therapeutic indicators, especially EC rate. AC constitutes an ideal model to work with an ACSu."

    "abstract": "Despite the large burden of critically ill patients in developing countries, mechanical ventilation (MV) is scarce in these low-resource settings. In the absence of data, issues like costs and lack of training are often felt to outweigh the benefits of potential MV implementation in such places. We aimed to investigate the impact and feasibility of MV in a surgical ICU in West Africa. This is a 7-month retrospective observational study (from October 25, 2022, to May 25, 2023), covering all patients consecutively admitted to ICU. The NGO EMERGENCY's hospital in Goderich, Freetown, Sierra Leone. The hospital is a referral center for acute care surgery. Critical patients admitted to the hospital's ICU. Following brief, practical training of the nursing staff, one basic mechanical ventilator was installed at the hospital's ICU, under the supervision of two intensivists. Only patients with a body weight of over 15 kg and who met the \"extreme criteria\" for MV received this life-saving therapy. Of the 195 files of patients admitted to ICU during the study period, 162 were analyzed. The median age was 16 (interquartile range 7-27) and 48.1% of the population were under 14 years. The most common cause of admission was trauma (58.6%), followed by acute abdomen (33.3%), caustic soda ingestion (6.2%), and burns (1.9%). Of the overall population, 26 patients (16%) underwent MV (88.5% trauma cases vs. 11.5% acute abdomen). Median time on MV was 24 hours (12-64). The mortality rate in the MV group was 30.8% (8/26), while in the overall study population, it was 11.7% (19/162). One potentially life-threatening event of tube obstruction was handled appropriately. This study strongly supports the implementation of MV in low-resource settings. In our experience, the consistent benefit of reduced mortality among critical patients largely outweighs the associated challenges."

In regions lacking specialized medical coverage for older patients, disparities in healthcare provision lead to poor clinical outcomes. We aimed to identify factors predicting index admission inpatient mortality from EGS among sexagenarians, septuagenarians, and octogenarians. Data of patients aged >60 years with EGS conditions defined by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma at primary index admission from 2010 to 2019 operated and non-operated at a large South Asian tertiary care hospital were analyzed. The primary outcome was primary index admission inpatient 30-day mortality. Parametric survival regression using Weibull distribution was performed. Factors such as patients' insurance status and surgical intervention were assessed using adjusted HR and 95% CI with a p-value of <0.05 considered statistically significant. We included 9551 primary index admissions of patients diagnosed with the nine most common primary EGS conditions. The mean patient age was 69.55±7.59 years. Overall mortality and complication rates were 3.94% and 42.29%, respectively. Primary index admission inpatient mortality was associated with complications including cardiac arrest and septic shock. Multivariable survival analysis showed that insurance status was not associated with mortality (HR 1.13; 95% CI 0.79, 1.61) after adjusting for other variables. The odds of developing complications among self-paid individuals were higher (adjusted OR 1.17; 95% CI 1.02, 1.35). Lack of healthcare coverage for older adults can result in delayed presentation, leading to increased morbidity. Close attention should be paid to such patients for timely provision of treatment. There is a need to expand primary care access and proper management of comorbidities for overall patient well-being. Government initiatives for expanding insurance coverage for older population can further enhance their healthcare access, mitigating the risk of essential treatments being withheld due to financial limitations.

A prospective observational study across 21 centers between 2019 and 2022 was conducted. Inclusion criteria were age 18 years or older, and DOAC, warfarin, or AP use within 24 hours of an emergency general surgery procedure. Outcomes included perioperative bleeding and in-hospital mortality. The study was conducted using analysis of variance, χ 2 , and multivariable regression models. Of the 413 patients, 221 (53.5%) reported AP use, 152 (36.8%) DOAC use, and 40 (9.7%) warfarin use. The most common indications for surgery were obstruction (23% [AP], 45% [DOAC], and 28% [warfarin]), intestinal ischemia (13%, 17%, and 23%), and diverticulitis/peptic ulcers (7%, 7%, and 15%). Compared with DOAC use, warfarin use was associated with significantly higher perioperative bleeding complication (odds ratio [OR], 4.4 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.0-9.9]). There was no significant difference in perioperative bleeding complication between DOAC and AP use (OR, 0.7 [95% CI, 0.4-1.1]). Compared with DOAC use, there was no significant difference in mortality between warfarin use (OR, 0.7 [95% CI, 0.2-2.5]) or AP use (OR, 0.5 [95% CI, 0.2-1.2]). After adjusting for confounders, warfarin use (OR, 6.3 [95% CI, 2.8-13.9]), medical history, and operative indication were associated with an increase in perioperative bleeding complications. However, warfarin was not independently associated with risk of mortality (OR, 1.3 [95% CI, 0.39-4.7]), whereas intraoperative vasopressor use (OR, 4.7 [95% CI, 1.7-12.8]), medical history, and postoperative bleeding (OR, 5.5 [95% CI, 2.4-12.8]) were. Despite ongoing concerns about the increase in DOAC use and lack of readily available reversal agents, this study suggests that warfarin, rather than DOACs, is associated with higher perioperative bleeding complications. However, that risk does not result in an increase in mortality, suggesting that perioperative decisions should be dictated by patient disease and comorbidities rather than type of AP or anticoagulant use.

We sought to characterize factors and evaluate outcomes associated with interhospital transfer using a contemporary national cohort. All adult hospitalizations for EGS (appendectomy, cholecystectomy, laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, small/large bowel resection, and perforated ulcer repair) ≤2 days of admission were identified in the 2016-2020 National Inpatient Sample. Patients initially admitted to a different institution and transferred to the operating hospital comprised the Transfer cohort (others: Non-Transfer). Multivariable models were developed to consider the association of Transfer with outcomes of interest. Of ∼1 653 169 patients, 107 945 (6.5%) were considered the Transfer cohort. The proportion of patients experiencing interhospital transfer increased from 5.2% to 7.7% (2016-2020, P < .001). On average, Transfer was older, more commonly of White race, and of a higher Elixhauser comorbidity index. After adjustment, increasing age, living in a rural area, receiving care in the Midwest, and decreasing income quartile were associated with greater odds of interhospital transfer. Following risk adjustment, Transfer remained linked with increased odds of in-hospital mortality (AOR 1.64, CI 1.49-1.80), as well as any perioperative complication (AOR 1.33, CI 1.27-1.38; Reference: Non-Transfer). Additionally, Transfer was associated with significantly longer duration of hospitalization (β + 1.04 days, CI + .91-1.17) and greater costs (β+$3,490, CI + 2840-4140). While incidence of interhospital transfer for EGS is increasing, transfer patients face greater morbidity and resource utilization. Novel interventions are needed to optimize patient selection and improve post-transfer outcomes."

Subsequent colostomy reversal was done 8 months postoperatively, and the patient did well and has been discharged with normal gastrointestinal function. Our successful conservative operative management of IARN deviates from previously described management in the literature which is emergent abdominoperineal resection.

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with participants aged 18 years or older that compared packing of perianal abscess cavities with no packing between 2002 and 2022 were searched for in December 2022 on OVID Medline and Embase, the CENTRAL register of trials, PubMed and Google Scholar. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Random effects meta-analysis was conducted on the data extracted. Three RCTs involving 490 patients were analysed for the outcomes of abscess recurrence and postoperative fistula formation; the data were not adequate to assess pain on dressing and time to healing. For unpacked versus packed, the pooled relative risk of abscess recurrence was 1.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.764, 3.29, p=0.219) and for fistula formation 0.686 (95% CI 0.430, 1.09, p=0.114). These results suggest there is no significant benefit to packing abscess cavities. Analysis of the outcomes suggests there is no significant difference with regards to rates of abscess recurrence or fistula formation between the packed and unpacked groups; however, appropriately powered RCTs are required in this area to provide more primary evidence to inform best practice and clinical management."

The OVID SP versions of MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched between January 1950 and October 2022. All randomized and non-randomized cohort studies comparing protocolized care streams with standard care protocols in adult patients (>18 years old) undergoing major emergency abdominal surgery with 30-day follow-up data were included. Studies were excluded if they reported on standardized care protocols in the trauma or elective setting. Outcomes assessed included length of stay, 30-day postoperative morbidity, 30-day postoperative mortality and 30-day readmission and reoperations rates. Risk of bias was assessed using ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies and RoB-2 for randomized controlled trials. Meta-analysis was performed using random effects modelling. Seventeen studies including 20 927 patients were identified, with 12 359 patients undergoing protocolized care pathways and 8568 patients undergoing standard care pathways. Thirteen unique protocolized pathways were identified, with a median of eight components (range 6-15), with compliance of 24-100%.

Protocolized care pathways had no impact on postoperative mortality (OR 0.87, 95% c.i. 0.41 to 1.87, P = 0.72). A reduction in specific postoperative complications was observed, including postoperative pneumonia (OR 0.42 95% c.i. 0.24 to 0.73, P = 0.002) and surgical site infection (OR 0.34, 95% c.i. 0.21 to 0.55, P < 0.001). Protocolized care pathways in the emergency setting currently lack standardization, with variable components and low compliance; however, despite this they are associated with short-term clinical benefits."

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic drove many healthcare systems worldwide to postpone elective surgery to increase healthcare capacity, manpower, and reduce infection risk to staff. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of an elective surgery postponement policy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic on surgical volumes and patient outcomes for three emergency bellwether procedures. A retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent any of the three emergency procedures [Caesarean section (CS), emergency laparotomy (EL), and open fracture (OF) fixation] between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2021 was conducted using clinical and surgical data from electronic medical records. The volumes and outcomes of each surgery were compared across four time periods: pre-COVID (January 2018-January 2020), elective postponement (February-May 2020), recovery (June-November 2020), and postrecovery (December 2020-December 2021) using Kruskal-Wallis test and segmented negative binomial regression. There was a total of 3886, 1396, and 299 EL, CS, and OF, respectively. There was no change in weekly volumes of CS and OF fixations across the four time periods. However, the volume of EL increased by 47% [95% confidence interval: 26-71%, P = 9.13 × 10-7) and 52% (95% confidence interval: 25-85%, P = 3.80 × 10-5) in the recovery and postrecovery period, respectively. Outcomes did not worsen throughout the four time periods for all three procedures and some actually improved for EL from elective postponement onwards. Elective surgery postponement in the early COVID-19 pandemic did not affect volumes of emergency CS and OF fixations but led to an increase in volume for EL after the postponement without any worsening of outcomes."

    "abstract": "Currently, there is a lack of ideal risk prediction tools in the field of emergency general surgery (EGS). The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma recommends developing risk assessment tools specifically for EGS-related diseases. In this study, we sought to utilize machine learning (ML) algorithms to explore and develop a web-based calculator for predicting five perioperative risk events of eight common operations in EGS. This study focused on patients with EGS and utilized electronic medical record systems to obtain data retrospectively from five centers in China. Five ML algorithms, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, were employed to construct predictive models for postoperative mortality, pneumonia, surgical site infection, thrombosis, and mechanical ventilation >48 h. The optimal models for each outcome event were determined based on metrics, including the value of the Area Under the Curve, F1 score, and sensitivity. A comparative analysis was conducted between the optimal models and Emergency Surgery Score (ESS), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification. A web-based calculator was developed to determine corresponding risk probabilities. Based on 10 993 patients with EGS, we determined the optimal RF model. The RF model also exhibited strong predictive performance compared with the ESS, APACHE II score, and ASA classification. Using this optimal model, the authors developed an online calculator with a questionnaire-guided interactive interface, catering to both the preoperative and postoperative application scenarios. The authors successfully developed an ML-based calculator for predicting the risk of postoperative adverse events in patients with EGS. This calculator accurately predicted the occurrence risk of five outcome events, providing quantified risk probabilities for clinical diagnosis and treatment."

    "abstract": "To investigate the relationships among opioid prescribing, consumption, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in patients undergoing emergency surgery. Overprescribing of opioids for pain management after surgery has become a public health concern and a major contributor to opioid misuse and dependency. Current guidelines do not address opioid prescribing after emergency surgical procedures, highlighting the importance of understanding the relationship between opioid prescribing and consumption in this setting. Retrospective analysis of the quantity of opioids prescribed and PROs in a population-based setting. The sample included adults ≥18 years undergoing emergency surgery across 69 hospitals in Michigan. Patients were included if they received a discharge opioid prescription and had valid data for opioid consumption and PROs. Surgical procedures took place between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2020. During the study period, a total of 3742 patients underwent an emergency operation. The mean number of opioid pills prescribed was 9.6 and the mean number of opioid pills consumed was 4.6. In a 2-model with logit in the first part and a linear regression in the second, prescription size was significantly associated with both the probability of consumption (adjusted odds ratio: 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01-1.04) and the amount of consumption conditional on any consumption (coefficient: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.54-0.86). Patients only consumed half of the opioids they were prescribed after undergoing emergency surgery. In addition, patients who were given larger prescriptions consumed more opioids, but did not experience less pain, higher satisfaction, better quality of life, or less regret to undergo surgery. Overall, this suggests that opioids may be excessively prescribed to patients undergoing emergency surgical procedures and that larger prescriptions do not improve the patient experience after surgery."

    "abstract": "Despite more than 61 million people in the United States living with a disability, studies on the impact of disability on health care disparities in surgical patients remain limited. Therefore, we aimed to understand the impact of disability on postoperative outcomes. We performed a retrospective cohort study using the Nationwide Readmission Database (2019). We compared patients ≥18 years undergoing emergency general surgery procedures with a disability condition with those without a disability. In accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, disability was defined as severe hearing, visual, intellectual, or motor impairment/caregiver dependency. The primary outcome was 30-day readmission rates. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay and 30-day complications and mortality. Patients were 1:1 propensity-matched using patient, procedure, and hospital characteristics. Among our population of 378,733 patients, 5,877 (1.6%) patients had at least 1 disability condition. A higher proportion of patients with a disability had low household income, $1 to $45,999, and an Elixhauser Comorbidity score ≥3. Among 5,768 matched pairs, patients with a disability had a significantly higher incidence of 30-day readmission (17.2% vs 12.7%; P < .001), infectious complications (29.8% vs 19.5%; P < .001), and a longer length of stay (8 vs 6 days; P < .001). Motor impairment, the most common disability, was associated with the greatest increase in patient readmission, morbidity, and length of stay. Severe intellectual, hearing, visual, or motor impairments were associated with higher readmission, morbidity, and longer length of stay. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms responsible for these disparities and to develop interventions to ameliorate them."

This study aimed to determine factors contributing to patients losing their independence and being discharged to residential and nursing homes having previously lived in their own residences. Our local data uploaded to the National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA) (2014-2022) were analyzed. This national database encompasses all major EGS cases undertaken in the United Kingdom. The variables considered were patient demographics, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, admission and discharge dates, presenting pathology, operation type, and discharge destination. Comparative analyses segmented patients based on postdischarge EGS destinations. Multivariable logistic regression identified factors linked to residential/nursing home placement after discharge. Significance was set at P < .05. Data from all patients in the NELA database (n = 1611) were analyzed. Approximately 1 in 10 patients older than 70 years never returned home. Patients requiring additional support were on average 8.6 years older (P = .008). At older than 80 years, the need for extra social support increased substantially with each increasing year in age, and those older than 85 years were more than twice as likely to require extra support than 80-year-olds (P < .001). Patients who died were 11.4 years older than those discharged without additional support (P < .001). A significant proportion of patients, particularly the elderly, do not return to their usual place of residence and require a higher level of care postemergency surgery. These important social factors need to be considered before operating given that they may have significant quality of life and economic implications."

The emergency surgery score (ESS) has been validated as a reliable preoperative predictor of postoperative outcomes in EGS but has been studied only in the US population. Our primary aim was to perform an external validation study of the ESS in a UK population. Our secondary aim was to compare the accuracy of ESS and National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA) scores. We conducted an observational cohort study of adult patients undergoing emergency laparotomy over three years in two UK centres. ESS was calculated retrospectively. NELA scores and all other variables were obtained from the prospectively collected Emergency Laparotomy and Laparoscopic Scottish Audit (ELLSA) database. The primary and secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality and postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) admission, respectively. A total of 609 patients were included. Median age was 65 years, 52.7% were female, the overall mortality was 9.9% and 23.8% were admitted to ICU. Both ESS and NELA were equally accurate in predicting 30-day mortality (c-statistic=0.78 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.71-0.85) for ESS and c-statistic=0.83 (95% CI, 0.77-0.88) for NELA, p=0.196) and predicting postoperative ICU admission (c-statistic=0.76 (95% CI, 0.71-0.81) for ESS and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.76-0.85) for NELA, p=0.092). In the UK population, ESS and NELA both predict 30-day mortality and ICU admission with no statistically significant difference but with higher c-statistics for NELA score. Both scores have certain advantages, with ESS being validated for a wider range of outcomes."

    "abstract": "An increasing number of older patients require emergency abdominal surgery for acute abdomen. They are susceptible to surgical stress and lose their independence in performing daily activities. Laparoscopic surgery is associated with faster recovery, less postoperative pain, and shorter hospital stay. However, few studies have examined the relationship between laparoscopic surgery and physical functional decline. Thus, we aimed to examine the relationship between changes in physical function and the surgical procedure. In this was a single-center, retrospective cohort study, we enrolled patients who were aged ≥ 65 years and underwent emergency abdominal surgery for acute abdomen between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2021. We assessed their activities of daily living using the Barthel Index. Functional decline was defined as a decrease of ≥ 20 points in Barthel Index at 28 days postoperatively, compared with the preoperative value. We evaluated an association between functional decline and surgical procedures among older patients, using multiple logistic regression analysis. During the study period, 852 patients underwent emergency abdominal surgery. Among these, 280 patients were eligible for the analysis. Among them, 94 underwent laparoscopic surgery, while 186 underwent open surgery. Patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery showed a less functional decline at 28 days postoperatively (6 vs. 49, p < 0.001). After adjustments for other covariates, laparoscopic surgery was an independent preventive factor for postoperative functional decline (OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.05-0.83; p < 0.05). In emergency abdominal surgery, laparoscopic surgery reduces postoperative physical functional decline in older patients. Widespread use of laparoscopic surgery can potentially preserve patient quality of life and may be important for the better development of emergency abdominal surgery."

To evaluate the association of outcomes in patients with prior MBS following EGS interventions. Academic, University-affiliated; USA. All adults undergoing nonelective EGS operations were identified using the 2016 to 2020 Nationwide Readmission Database. Patients with a history of MBS were subsequently categorized as Bariatric, with the remainder of patients as NonBariatric. The primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality, while perioperative complications, length of stay (LOS), hospitalization costs, non-home discharge, and 30-day readmission were secondarily assessed. Multivariable regression models were developed to evaluate the association of history of MBS with outcomes of interest. Of an estimated 632,375 hospitalizations for EGS operations, 29,112 (4.6%) had a history of MBS. Compared to Nonbariatric, Bariatric were younger, more frequently female and more commonly had severe obesity. Following risk adjustment, Bariatric had significantly lower odds of in-hospital mortality (AOR .83, 95%CI .71-.98). Compared to others, Bariatric had reduced LOS by .5 days (95%CI .4-.7) and hospitalization costs by $1600 (95%CI $900-2100). Patients with prior MBS had reduced odds of nonhome discharge (AOR .89, 95%CI .85-.93) and increased likelihood of 30-day readmissions (AOR 2.32, 95%CI 1.93--2.79) following EGS. Prior MBS is associated with decreased mortality and perioperative complications as well as reduced resource utilization in select EGS procedures. Our findings suggest that patients with a history of MBS can be managed effectively by acute surgical interventions."

To describe temporal trends in the use of laparoscopic and robotic approaches and compare outcomes between robotic and laparoscopic surgery for 4 common emergent surgical procedures. A retrospective cohort study of an all-payer discharge database of 829 US facilities was conducted from calendar years 2013 to 2021. Data analysis was performed from July 2022 to November 2023. A total of 1 067 263 emergent or urgent cholecystectomies (n = 793 800), colectomies (n = 89 098), inguinal hernia repairs (n = 65 039), and ventral hernia repairs (n = 119 326) in patients aged 18 years or older were included. Surgical approach (robotic, laparoscopic, or open) to emergent or urgent cholecystectomy, colectomy, inguinal hernia repair, or ventral hernia repair. The primary outcome was the temporal trend in use of each operative approach (laparoscopic, robotic, or open). Secondary outcomes included conversion to open surgery and length of stay (both total and postoperative). Temporal trends were measured using linear regression. Propensity score matching was used to compare secondary outcomes between robotic and laparoscopic surgery groups. During the study period, the use of robotic surgery increased significantly year-over-year for all procedures: 0.7% for cholecystectomy, 0.9% for colectomy, 1.9% for inguinal hernia repair, and 1.1% for ventral hernia repair. There was a corresponding decrease in the open surgical approach for all cases. Compared with laparoscopy, robotic surgery was associated with a significantly lower risk of conversion to open surgery: cholecystectomy, 1.7% vs 3.0% (odds ratio [OR], 0.55 [95% CI, 0.49-0.62]); colectomy, 11.2% vs 25.5% (OR, 0.37 [95% CI, 0.32-0.42]); inguinal hernia repair, 2.4% vs 10.7% (OR, 0.21 [95% CI, 0.16-0.26]); and ventral hernia repair, 3.5% vs 10.9% (OR, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.25-0.36]). Robotic surgery was associated with shorter postoperative lengths of stay for colectomy (-0.48 [95% CI, -0.60 to -0.35] days), inguinal hernia repair (-0.20 [95% CI, -0.30 to -0.10] days), and ventral hernia repair (-0.16 [95% CI, -0.26 to -0.06] days). While robotic surgery is still not broadly used for emergency general surgery, the findings of this study suggest it is becoming more prevalent and may be associated with better outcomes as measured by reduced conversion to open surgery and decreased length of stay."

The aim of the present study is to evaluate our institution's experience in terms of the prevalence of AN, their histological types, treatment and outcomes in adult patients undergoing emergency appendectomy. Single-centre retrospective cohort analysis of patients treated for acute appendicitis at a large academic medical centre. Patients with a diagnosis of acute appendicitis (AA) where further compared with patients with acute appendicitis and a histologically confirmed diagnosis of appendiceal neoplasm (AN). A diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made in 1200 patients. Of these, 989 patients underwent emergency appendectomy. The overall incidence of appendiceal neoplasm was 9.3% (92 patients). AN rate increased with increasing age. Patients under the age of 30 had a 3.8% (14/367 patients) rate of occult neoplasm, whereas patients between 40 and 89 years and older had a 13.0% rate of neoplasm. No difference was found in clinical presentations and type of approach while we found a lower complicated appendicitis rate in the AN group. ANs are less rare with respect to the literature; however, clinically, there are no specific signs of suspicious and simple appendicectomy appears to be curative in most cases. However, age plays an important role; older patients are at higher risk for AN. ANs still challenge the non-operative management concept introduced into the surgical literature."

It is paramount to identify these patients and minimise this risk. This study aimed to describe current practices in identifying malnutrition in patients undergoing a laparotomy, specifically focusing on screening, assessment, nutrition pathways and barriers encountered by clinicians. Following piloting and validity assessment, anaesthetic and surgical National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA) Leads at hospitals across England and Wales were emailed an invitation to a survey. Responses were gathered using Qualtrics. Descriptive analysis and correlation with laparotomy volume and professional role were performed in SPSSv26. University of Sheffield ethical approval was obtained (UREC 046205). The results from the survey are reported according to the CHERRIES guidelines. The survey was completed by 166/289 NELA Leads from 117/167 hospitals (57.4% and 70.1% response rates, respectively). Participants reported low rates of nutritional screening (42/166; 25.3%) and assessment (26/166; 15.7%) for malnutrition preoperatively. More than one third of respondents (40.1%) had no awareness of local screening tools; indeed, the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) was used by approximately half of respondents (56.6%). Contrary to guidelines, NELA Leads report albumin levels continue to be used to determine malnutrition risk (73.5%; 122/166). Postoperative nutrition pathways were common (71.7%; 119/166). Reported barriers to nutritional screening and assessment included a lack of time, training and education, organisational support and ownership. Participants indicated nutrition risk is inadequately identified and is an important missing data item from NELA. There was no significant correlation with hospital laparotomy volume in relation to screening or assessment for malnutrition, the use of nutritional support pathways or organisational barriers. There was interprofessional agreement across a number of domains, although some differences did exist. Wide variation exists in the current practice of identifying malnutrition risk in NELA patients. Barriers include a lack of time, knowledge and ownership. Nutrition pathways that encompass the preoperative phase and incorporation of nutrition data in NELA may support improvements in care."

The indications for ICG use in surgery have expanded where guided surgery directed by fluorescence and near-infrared fluorescent imaging offers numerous advantages. Recently, surgeons have reported using ICG operative navigation in the emergency setting, with fluorescent cholangiography being the most common procedure. The utility of ICG also involves real-time perfusion assessment, such as ischemic organs and limbs. The rising use of ICG in surgery can be explained by the ICG's rapid technological evolution, accuracy, ease of use, and great potential to guide precision surgical diagnosis and management. The review aims to summarize the current literature on the uses of ICG in emergency general surgery. It provides a comprehensive and practical summary of the use of ICG, including indication, route of administration, and dosages. To simplify the application of ICG, we subdivided its use into anatomical mapping and perfusion assessment. Anatomical mapping includes the biliary tree, ureters, and bowel. Perfusion assessment includes bowel, pancreas, skin and soft tissue, and gonads. This review provides a reference to emergency general surgeons to aid in implementing ICG in the emergency setting for more enhanced and safer patient care."

Patients with minor complications less frequently reported trust in their team and discussed communication issues and delays in care (all p ​< ​0.05). Patients with major complications more frequently reported confidence in their team and gratefulness, but also communication limitations (all p ​< ​0.05).

A total of 10 studies were identified for analysis. These included 5,113 patients in the standardized handoff group and 5,293 in the current process group. Standardized handoffs reduced handover errors for perioperative interactions and preventable adverse events for intra/interfloor and ICU interactions. There were insufficient data to evaluate outcomes of clinical complications and medical errors.

This investigation encompasses the most recent progress, procedures, and obstacles in ACS, utilizing various sources such as scholarly articles, clinical trials, and expert statements. The development of ACS as a specialized field is a significant area of concentration, particularly emphasizing its contribution to improving patient care. An examination is conducted on the efficacy of contemporary triage systems and prompt response mechanisms, specifically in diminishing the incidence of illness and death rates associated with illnesses such as trauma, acute appendicitis, and obstructed viscera. The emphasis is placed on the surgical protocols and principles that form the basis of ACS. Examining regional and international approaches provides insight into the distinctions and commonalities in surgical techniques. An assessment is conducted to determine the effects of the transition to minimally invasive procedures on patient outcomes, recuperation periods, and healthcare expenses. The assessment also examines the logistical obstacles that ACS encounters, such as resource allocation and managing diverse teams. The examination focuses on the delicate equilibrium between prompt decision-making and care grounded in evidence. It also evaluates the possible contribution of technical breakthroughs such as telemedicine and AI to improving patient care and overcoming current obstacles. The topic of training and education for surgeons in ACS is of utmost importance and requires careful consideration. The evaluation evaluates the sufficiency of existing educational frameworks and the necessity of specific training to equip surgeons for the requirements of ACS. This analysis explores the current discourse surrounding the standardization of ACS training, considering its potential ramifications for the future of surgical procedures. Exploring ethical and legal problems in ACS also includes situations when prompt decision-making may clash with patient autonomy and informed consent. The significance of proficient communication with patients and their families during emergency surgical scenarios is underscored, emphasizing the necessity for ethical awareness and interpersonal aptitude. The investigation of ACS demonstrates its dynamic character, signifying notable advancements while recognizing enduring obstacles. Continual research, interdisciplinary collaboration, and policy adjustments are necessary to improve ACS procedures. This thorough investigation offers valuable insights for professionals and researchers, facilitating future progress in managing surgical crises."

    "title": "Wandering Spleen After Sleeve Gastrectomy as a Cause of Sigmoid Volvulus.",
    "abstract": "The report highlights a rare instance of colonic volvulus due to a wandering spleen. Wandering spleen is characterized by the displacement of the spleen due to absent or weakened ligaments due to congenital factors or acquired factors such as pregnancy or prior surgery leading to ligament disruption. The 26-year-old patient presented with severe abdominal pain and distention, leading to a diagnosis of sigmoid volvulus secondary to the wandering spleen. This case underscores the importance of considering the wandering spleen in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen, especially in patients with a surgical history of gastric sleeve resection. The article emphasizes the critical role of imaging in diagnosis and the necessity of timely surgical intervention to prevent severe complications. The case contributes to a broader understanding of the wandering spleen, particularly in post-surgical contexts, highlighting diagnostic challenges and management strategies."

    "abstract": "Obtaining adequate vascular access is imperative for effective resuscitative, therapeutic, and diagnostic interventions. The intraosseous (IO) route is indicated when immediate vascular access is needed, and standard central or peripheral intravenous (IV) access is unattainable or would delay therapy in a critical patient. We present a rare case of improper IO line placement in the right proximal tibia of a 30-year-old female involved in a motor vehicle collision, resulting in extravasation of blood products into the surrounding tissue and development of acute compartment syndrome. Emergency Medical Services was unable to obtain IV access in a timely manner, thus a right proximal tibia 45mm IO line was placed, and a unit of whole blood was given with a high-pressure infusor in the field. At the trauma center, the patient's right lower extremity was severely tense and edematous with no palpable right lower extremity pulses and no Doppler signals. Computed tomography revealed the IO catheter extending through both the proximal and distal cortices of the right tibia. Medial and lateral fasciotomy of the right lower extremity was performed in which all four compartments of the right lower leg were released and a significant hematoma was evacuated from the superficial posterior compartment. This case highlights the importance of IO access as a life-saving intervention while also underscoring the need to educate and familiarize pre-hospital and hospital healthcare personnel in delivering IO access so as to mitigate risks and improve outcomes for critically ill patients."

    "abstract": "Despite advances and improvements in the management of surgical patients, emergency and trauma surgery is associated with high morbidity and mortality. This may be due in part to delays in definitive surgical management in the operating room (OR). There is a lack of studies focused on OR prioritization and resource allocation in emergency surgery. The Operating Room management for emergency Surgical Activity (ORSA) study was conceived to assess the management of operating theatres and resources from a global perspective among expert international acute care surgeons. The ORSA study was conceived as an international web survey. The questionnaire was composed of 23 multiple-choice and open questions. Data were collected over 3 months. Participation in the survey was voluntary and anonymous. One hundred forty-seven emergency and acute care surgeons answered the questionnaire; the response rate was 58.8%. The majority of the participants come from Europe. One hundred nineteen surgeons (81%; 119/147) declared to have at least one emergency OR in their hospital; for the other 20/147 surgeons (13.6%), there is not a dedicated emergency operating room. Forty-six (68/147)% of the surgeons use the elective OR to perform emergency procedures during the day. The planning of an emergency surgical procedure is done by phone by 70% (104/147) of the surgeons. There is no dedicated emergency OR in the majority of hospitals internationally. Elective surgical procedures are usually postponed or even cancelled to perform emergency surgery. It is a priority to validate an effective universal triaging and scheduling system to allocate emergency surgical procedures. The new Timing in Acute Care Surgery (TACS) was recently proposed and validated by a Delphi consensus as a clear and reproducible triage tool to timely perform an emergency surgical procedure according to the clinical severity of the surgical disease. The new TACS needs to be prospectively validated in clinical practice. Logistics have to be assessed using a multi-disciplinary approach to improve patients' safety, optimise the use of resources, and decrease costs."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery conditions are common, costly, and highly morbid. The proportion of excess morbidity due to variation in health systems and processes of care is poorly understood. We constructed a collaborative quality initiative for emergency general surgery to investigate the emergency general surgery care provided and guide process improvements. We collected data at 10 hospitals from July 2019 to December 2022. Five cohorts were defined: acute appendicitis, acute gallbladder disease, small bowel obstruction, emergency laparotomy, and overall aggregate. Processes and inpatient outcomes investigated included operative versus nonoperative management, mortality, morbidity (mortality and/or complication), readmissions, and length of stay. Multivariable risk adjustment accounted for variations in demographic, comorbid, anatomic, and disease traits. Of the 19,956 emergency general surgery patients, 56.8% were female and 82.8% were White, and the mean (SD) age was 53.3 (20.8) years. After accounting for patient and disease factors, the adjusted aggregate mortality rate was 3.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.2-3.7), morbidity rate was 27.6% (95% CI, 27.0-28.3), and the readmission rate was 15.1% (95% CI, 14.6-15.6). Operative management varied between hospitals from 70.9% to 96.9% for acute appendicitis and 19.8% to 79.4% for small bowel obstruction. Significant differences in outcomes between hospitals were observed with high- and low-outlier performers identified after risk adjustment in the overall cohort for mortality, morbidity, and readmissions. The use of a Gastrografin challenge in patients with a small bowel obstruction ranged from 10.7% to 61.4% of patients. In patients who underwent initial nonoperative management of acute cholecystitis, 51.5% had a cholecystostomy tube placed. The cholecystostomy tube placement rate ranged from 23.5% to 62.1% across hospitals. A multihospital emergency general surgery collaborative reveals high morbidity with substantial variability in processes and outcomes among hospitals. A targeted collaborative quality improvement effort can identify outliers in emergency general surgery care and may provide a mechanism to optimize outcomes. Therapeutic/Care Management; Level III."

    "abstract": "Functional deterioration following emergency general surgery (EGS) poses a significant challenge in super-elderly patients. However, limited research has focused on assessing the deterioration in postoperative performance status (PS). This study aimed to investigate the impact of EGS on PS deterioration in super-elderly patients, and the extent to which deteriorated PS is recovered. This historical cohort study comprised 77 super-elderly patients who underwent EGS between July 2015 and December 2020. Functional deterioration was evaluated by comparing preoperative and postoperative Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS). The Emergency Surgical Score (ESS) was used as a risk-adjustment tool. Questionnaires were mailed to the patients and their families to assess post-discharge PS and obtain their impressions of EGS. Postoperative PS deteriorated in 35/77 patients (45.5 %). Significant differences were observed between the groups in terms of sex, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, ESS scores, preoperative ECOG-PS, duration of operation, and major complications. Multivariate analysis of preoperative factors showed that ESS ≥7 (OR: 3.7, 95 % CI: 1.0-13), preoperative ECOG-PS ≤2 (OR: 5.9, 95 % CI: 1.7-21), and female sex (OR: 5.8, 95 % CI: 1.6-21) were associated with postoperative ECOG-PS deterioration. According to the questionnaire results, PS recovery post-discharge was observed in 6/36 (17 %) patients, and 34/36 (94 %) patients and their families expressed positive impressions of EGS. EGS in super-elderly patients highly caused a deterioration in their PS, particularly in patients with maintained preoperative PS. PS hardly recovered; however, most patients and their families had positive impressions of the EGS. We assessed the pre- and postoperative performance status of super-elderly patients who underwent emergency general surgery. Surgery caused a marked deterioration in patients' functional performance, which seldom recovered postoperatively."

    "abstract": "In conflict zones, providers may have to decide between delaying time-sensitive surgeries or performing operative interventions in the field, potentially subjecting patients to significant infection risks. We conducted a single-arm crossover study to assess the feasibility of using an ultraportable operating room (U-OR) for surgical procedures on a porcine cadaver abdominal traumatic injury model in an active war zone. We enrolled participants from an ASSET-type course designed to train Ukrainian surgeons before deployment to active conflict zones. They performed three standardized consecutive abdominal surgical procedures (liver, kidney, and small bowel injury repair) with and without the U-OR. Primary outcomes included surgical procedure completion rate, procedure time, and airborne particle count at the start of surgery. Secondary survey-based outcomes assessed surgery task load index (SURG-TLX) and perceived operative factors. Fourteen surgeons performed 76 surgical procedures (38 with the U-OR, 38 without the U-OR). The completion rate for each surgical procedure was 100% in both groups. While the procedure time for the liver injury repair did not differ significantly between the two groups, the use of the U-OR was associated with a longer time for kidney (155 vs. 56 s, p = 0.002), and small bowel (220 vs. 103 s, p = 0.004) injury repair. The average airborne particle count within the U-OR was substantially lower compared to outside the U-OR (6,753,852 vs. 232,282 n/m3, p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in SURG-TLX for procedures performed with and without the U-OR. The use of the U-OR did not affect the procedure completion rate or SURG-TLX. However, there was a marked difference in airborne particle counts between inside and outside the U-OR during surgery. These preliminary findings indicate the potential feasibility of using a U-OR to perform abdominal damage-control surgical procedures in austere settings."

    "abstract": "Colon cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide. Approximately one-fifth of colon cancers will present emergently due to obstruction or perforation. Necrotizing soft tissue infection is a rare presentation of perforated colon cancer and represents a surgical emergency due to high mortality rate.  A man in his 80s presented with several days of scrotal pain and weakness. On physical exam he was found to have scrotal edema and erythema and bilateral inguinal hernias. Imaging revealed a large scrotal abscess and concern for necrotizing soft tissue infection. He was taken to the operating room for surgical debridement and exploration and was discovered to have perforated colon within an incarcerated inguinal hernia. He underwent exploratory laparotomy with sigmoid resection and end colostomy creation. Pathology returned demonstrating invasive sigmoid adenocarcinoma. Fournier's gangrene requires a high index of suspicion. It is a rapidly progressing infection associated with high mortality. Early initiation of antibiotics and surgical debridement are mainstays of treatment. When associated with perforated colonic malignancy, workup must include imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis as well as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level to complete staging. Fournier's gangrene secondary to perforated sigmoid adenocarcinoma is a unique presentation. Treatment first involves antibiotics and aggressive surgical debridement. Once the patient is stabilized, further oncologic workup should be completed to determine treatment course."

The absence of definitive diagnostic modalities necessitates prompt and adaptable surgical intervention. We present an 18-year-old male who sustained a right atrial blunt traumatic cardiac rupture following a motor vehicle collision. Despite initial stabilization with blood products and vasopressors and the necessitated emergent surgical exploration, the case required various surgical techniques, including anterolateral followed by an extension to a clamshell thoracotomy and laparotomy to manage the complex cardiac rupture and associated injuries. Furthermore, it underscores the critical nature of surgical incision in such patients and its impact on the overall prognosis. The successful outcome, highlighted by intraoperative decision-making and proper postoperative care, demonstrates that with timely and adaptable surgical approaches, even the most severe cases of traumatic blunt cardiac ruptures can be managed effectively."

An accurate selection of patients who could benefit from surgery is essential to avoid unnecessary invasive treatment. In this study, we tried to determine if advanced age (>80 years) represents a risk factor for negative short-term outcome in patients undergoing emergency surgery for acute abdominal oncological illness. We retrospectively analyzed the records of patients who underwent emergency oncological surgery at the Department of Acute Care Surgery of Padua General Hospital from January 2018 to December 2022. One hundred two cancer patients were included in the study. Among them, 42 were aged ≥80 years (41%). Multiple preoperative and postoperative parameters were recorded, and the follow-up period was at least 90 days. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with short-term postoperative outcomes. In the octogenarian group, 30-day mortality was 11% vs. 9.5% in the younger group [p = not significant (ns)] and 90-day mortality was 17.6% in the octogenarian group vs. 20.5% in the younger group (p = ns). Postoperative morbidity and hospital length of stay were not significantly different in the two groups. Low albumin levels [odds ratio (OR) 30.6, 9.51-87.07] and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (OR 26.4, 9.18-75.83) were predictive for short-term mortality in surgical oncological emergencies. Advanced age is not a risk factor for negative outcomes in surgical oncological emergencies. Therefore, surgical options should be considered in octogenarians with oncological emergencies and acceptable clinical conditions. Serum albumin levels and LDH can help predict the postoperative outcome after surgery for oncological emergencies."

Since care in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) often engages visitors as surrogate decision-makers, we investigated whether there was an association between COVID-19-related visitor restrictions, goals of care discussions (GOCD), and patient outcomes in SICU patients. We conducted a retrospective review of trauma and emergency general surgery (EGS) patients admitted to a rural tertiary SICU between July 2019 and April 2021, dividing patients into those admitted during COVID-19 visitor restrictions and those admitted at other times. Using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, we compared the primary outcome, incidence of GOCD, and incidence of prolonged hospital (> 14 d) and intensive care unit length of stay (LOS, > 7 d) between the two groups. One hundred seventy nine of 368 study patients (48.6%) presented during restricted visitation. The proportion of GOCD was 38.0% and 36.5% in the restricted and nonrestricted visitation cohorts, respectively (P = 0.769). GOCD timing and outcomes were similar in both groups. The use of telecommunication increased during restricted visitation, as did the proportion of trauma patients admitted to the SICU. On multivariable logistic regression, age and patient category were independent predictors of GOCD. On outcomes analysis, visitor restriction was associated with prolonged hospital LOS for EGS patients (odds ratio 2.44, 95% confidence interval 1.01-5.91, P value 0.048). Restricted visitation was not associated with changes in frequency or outcome of GOCD, but was associated with prolonged hospital LOS among EGS patients who had SICU admissions. Further investigation of patient/surrogate satisfaction with virtual GOCD in the SICU setting is needed."

    "abstract": "Laparoscopy is widely adopted across nearly all surgical subspecialties in the elective setting. Initially finding indication in minor abdominal emergencies, it has gradually become the standard approach in the majority of elective general surgery procedures. Despite many technological advances and increasing acceptance, the laparoscopic approach remains underutilized in emergency general surgery and in abdominal trauma. Emergency laparotomy continues to carry a high morbidity and mortality. In recent years, there has been a growing interest from emergency and trauma surgeons in adopting minimally invasive surgery approaches in the acute surgical setting. The present position paper, supported by the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES), aims to provide a review of the literature to reach a consensus on the indications and benefits of a laparoscopic-first approach in patients requiring emergency abdominal surgery for general surgery emergencies or abdominal trauma. This position paper was developed according to the WSES methodology. A steering committee performed the literature review and drafted the position paper. An international panel of 54 experts then critically revised the manuscript and discussed it in detail, to develop a consensus on a position statement. A total of 323 studies (systematic review and meta-analysis, randomized clinical trial, retrospective comparative cohort studies, case series) have been selected from an initial pool of 7409 studies. Evidence demonstrates several benefits of the laparoscopic approach in stable patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery for general surgical emergencies or abdominal trauma. The selection of a stable patient seems to be of paramount importance for a safe adoption of a laparoscopic approach. In hemodynamically stable patients, the laparoscopic approach was found to be safe, feasible and effective as a therapeutic tool or helpful to identify further management steps and needs, resulting in improved outcomes, regardless of conversion. Appropriate patient selection, surgeon experience and rigorous minimally invasive surgical training, remain crucial factors to increase the adoption of laparoscopy in emergency general surgery and abdominal trauma. The WSES expert panel suggests laparoscopy as the first approach for stable patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery for general surgery emergencies and abdominal trauma."

    "abstract": "Introduction The objective of this investigation was to conduct an audit of the consent form standards signed by patients before elective or emergency general surgery at our institution. The investigation involved a comparison of these standards with those outlined in the \"HSE National Consent Policy 2022\" established by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI). In the event of discrepancies, we intended to complete the audit loop by educating general surgeons on the essential standards for obtaining written consent in both elective and emergency general surgical procedures. Methods To assess the quality of patient consent, a pre-interventional phase was conducted over one week. Information was gathered exclusively through electronic medical record systems. Subsequent to the data analysis, an in-person educational session was conducted to enlighten non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs) in surgery about the significance of informed written consent and the criteria for lawful consent according to local guidelines established by the HSE and the RCSI. Three months following the intervention, a follow-up cycle was carried out to evaluate whether there were any improvements in the standards of consent. Results In the initial phase, prior to intervention, a total of 95 consent forms were collected. The patient's name, date of birth (DOB), and hospital board number (BN) were accurately recorded in all consent forms. However, only 66% (n=63) were accurately documented without the use of abbreviations or acronyms. Following the intervention, 145 consent forms were gathered. All appropriately indicated the patient's name, DOB, and BN. However, 84% (n=122) of consent forms were correctly labeled without the use of abbreviations or acronyms (p=0.0017). Conclusion This closed-loop review illustrates that the quality of consent can be notably enhanced through a straightforward educational intervention led by NCHDs in general surgery. Such interventions can be instructive, leading to improved consent form documentation. This, in turn, enhances patient safety and helps prevent potential medico-legal repercussions for both healthcare providers and institutions."

On physical exam, he was diffusely tender in the bilateral lower quadrants with guarding. Imaging demonstrated moderate volume pneumoperitoneum. On review of his imaging, the pneumoperitoneum was centered around a 7 cm necrotic lymph node. Repeat CT scan with positive oral (PO) and rectal contrast demonstrated no extraluminal contrast extravasation, but air bubbles were seen extending from the necrotic lymph node into the lower abdominal cavity. He underwent CT-guided drain placement and was started on antibiotics, and improved without surgical intervention. In stable patients presenting with pneumoperitoneum and known intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy, perforated viscus should be ruled out prior to surgical intervention, and necrotic intra-abdominal lymph node should be considered as a differential diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Background: Infectious complications lead to worse post-operative outcomes and are used to compare hospital performance in pay-for-performance programs. However, the impact of social and behavioral determinants of health on infectious complication rates after emergency general surgery (EGS) remains unclear. Patients and Methods: All patients undergoing EGS in the 2019 Nationwide Readmissions Database were included. The primary outcome of the study was the rate of infectious complications within 30 days, defined as a composite outcome including all infectious complications occurring during the index hospitalization or 30-day re-admission. Secondary outcomes included specific infectious complication rates. Multivariable regression analyses were used to study the impact of patient characteristics, social determinants of health (insurance status, median household income in the patient's residential zip code), and behavioral determinants of health (substance use disorders, neuropsychiatric comorbidities) on post-operative infection rates. Results: Of 367,917 patients included in this study, 20.53% had infectious complications. Medicare (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-1.34; p < 0.001), Medicaid (aOR, 1.24; 95% CI,1.19-1.29; p < 0.001), lowest zip code income quartile (aOR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.13-1.22; p < 0.001), opioid use disorder (aOR,1.18; 95% CI,1.10-1.29; p < 0.001), and neurodevelopmental disorders (aOR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.90-2.45; p < 0.001) were identified as independent predictors of 30-day infectious complications. A similar association between determinants of health and infectious complications was also seen for pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sepsis, and catheter-association urinary tract infection (CAUTI). Conclusions: Social and behavioral determinants of health are associated with a higher risk of developing post-operative infectious complications in EGS. Accounting for these factors in pay-for-performance programs and public reporting could promote fairer comparisons of hospital performance."

    "abstract": "The field of bariatric and metabolic surgery has changed rapidly over the past two decades, with an exponential increase in case volumes being performed because of its proven efficacy for morbid obesity and obesity-related comorbidities. Although this increased volume of procedures has been accompanied by significant decrease in postoperative complication rates, there are numerous potential complications after bariatric surgery that may require urgent or emergent surgical evaluation or interventions. Many of these risks extend well beyond the early postoperative period and can present months to years after the index procedure. Acute care surgeons are increasingly covering most or all of the emergency general surgery services at many centers and must be familiar with the numerous bariatric surgical procedures being performed and their individual complication profile to provide optimal care for these frequently challenging patients. This article provides a focused and concise review of the common bariatric procedures being performed, their early and late complication profiles, and a practical guide to the optimal diagnostic evaluations, surgical interventions, and perioperative management options.

    "abstract": "When presenting for emergency general surgery (EGS) care, older adults frequently experience increased risk of adverse outcomes owing to factors related to age (\"geriatric vulnerability\") and the social determinants of health unique to the places in which they live (\"neighborhood vulnerability\"). Little is known about how such factors collectively influence adverse outcomes. We sought to explore how the interaction between geriatric and neighborhood vulnerability influences EGS outcomes among older adults. Older adults, 65 years or older, hospitalized with an AAST-defined EGS condition were identified in the 2016 to 2019, 2021 Florida State Inpatient Database. Latent variable models combined the influence of patient age, multimorbidity, and Hospital Frailty Risk Score into a single metric of \"geriatric vulnerability.\" Variations in geriatric vulnerability were then compared across differences in \"neighborhood vulnerability\" as measured by variations in Area Deprivation Index, Social Vulnerability Index, and their corresponding subthemes (e.g., access to transportation). A total of 448,968 older adults were included. For patients living in the least vulnerable neighborhoods, increasing geriatric vulnerability resulted in up to six times greater risk of death (30-day risk-adjusted hazards ratio [HR], 6.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.49-8.89). The effect was more than doubled among patients living in the most vulnerable neighborhoods, where increasing geriatric vulnerability resulted in up to 15 times greater risk of death (30-day risk-adjusted HR, 15.12; 95% CI, 12.57-18.19). When restricted to racial/ethnic minority patients, the multiplicative effect was four-times as high, resulting in corresponding 30-day HRs for mortality of 11.53 (95% CI, 4.51-29.44) versus 40.67 (95% CI, 22.73-72.78). Similar patterns were seen for death within 365 days. Both geriatric and neighborhood vulnerability have been shown to affect prehospital risk among older patients. The results of this study build on that work, presenting the first in-depth look at the powerful multiplicative interaction between these two factors. The results show that where a patient resides can fundamentally alter expected outcomes for EGS care such that otherwise less vulnerable patients become functionally equivalent to those who are, at baseline, more aged, more frail, and more sick.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has changed delivery of emergency general surgery (EGS) and contributed to widespread bed shortages. At our institution, rapid testing is not routinely approved for EGS patients. We examined common EGS conditions (appendicitis and acute cholecystitis), hypothesizing that necessity of testing for COVID-19 significantly delayed operative intervention. We performed a prepost study to examine a 2-month timeframe, or historical control, prior to COVID-19 testing (January 1, 2020-March 1, 2020) as well as a 2-month timeframe during the COVID-19 era (January 1, 2021-March 1, 2021). We chose conditions that are frequently treated surgically as outpatient or observation status. We examined time for COVID-19 test to result, and associated time to operative intervention (operating room (OR)) and need for admission. Median time to COVID-19 test results was 7.4 hours (IQR 5.8-13.1). For appendectomy, time to surgical consultation or case request did not differ between cohorts. Time to OR after case request was significantly longer (12.5 vs 1.9 hours, p<0.001) and patients more frequently required admission prior to operative intervention if receiving treatment in the COVID-19 timeframe. Similarly, for cholecystectomy there were no differences in time to surgical consultation or case request, but time to OR after case request was longer in the COVID-19 era (21.1 vs 9.0 hours, p<0.001). While COVID-19 positivity rates have declined, the purpose of this study was to reflect on one element of our hospital system's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on our institutional experience, waiting for COVID-19 test results directly impacts time to surgery, as well as the need for admission for a historically outpatient procedure. In the future, if the healthcare system is asked to respond to another pandemic or similar situation, expediting time to OR to eliminate unnecessary time in the hospital and non-critical admissions should be paramount.

    "abstract": "The Surgical Apgar Score (SAS) is a 10-point validated score comprised of three intraoperative variables (blood loss, lowest heart rate, and lowest mean arterial pressure). Lower scores are worse and predict major postoperative complications. The SAS has not been applied in emergency general surgery (EGS) but may help guide postoperative disposition. We hypothesize that SAS can predict complications in EGS patients undergoing a laparotomy. We performed a retrospective review of adult patients at a single, quaternary care center who underwent an exploratory laparotomy for EGS conditions within 6 hours of surgical consultation from 2015 to 2019. Patients were grouped by whether they experienced a postoperative complication (systemic, surgical, and/or death). Multivariable regression was performed to predict complications, accounting for SAS and other statistically significant variables between groups. Using this model, predicted probabilities of a complication were generated for each SAS. The cohort comprised 482 patients: 32.8% (n = 158) experienced a complication, while 67.2% (n = 324) did not. Patients with complications were older, frailer, more often male, had worse SAS (6 vs. 7, p < 0.0001) and American Society of Anesthesiologists scores, and higher rates of perforated hollow viscus ( p = 0.0003) and open abdomens ( p < 0.0001). On multivariable regression, an increasing SAS independently predicted less complications (adjusted odds ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.75-0.96; p = 0.009). An SAS ≤4 was associated with a 49.2% predicted chance of complications, greater rates of septic shock (9.7% vs. 3%, p = 0.01), respiratory failure (20.5% vs. 10.8%, p = 0.02), and death (24.1% vs. 7.5%, p < 0.0001). An SAS ≤ 4 did not correlate with surgical complications ( p = 0.1). The SAS accurately predicts postoperative complications in EGS patients undergoing urgent laparotomy, with an SAS ≤ 4 identifying patients at risk for septic shock, respiratory failure, and mortality. This tool can aid in rapidly determining postoperative disposition and resource allocation. Therapeutic/Care Management; Level IV."

    "abstract": "Studies focusing on Emergency General Surgery (EGS) and Interhospital Transfer (IHT) and the association of race and sex and morbidity and mortality are yet to be conducted. We aim to investigate the association of race and sex and outcomes among IHT patients who underwent emergency general surgery. A retrospective review of adult patients who were transferred prior to EGS procedures using the National Surgery Quality Improvement Project from 2014 to 2020. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to compare outcomes (readmission, major and minor postoperative complications, and reoperation) between interhospital transfer and direct admit patients and to investigate the association of race and sex for adverse outcomes for all EGS procedures. A secondary analysis was performed for each individual EGS procedure. Compared to patients transferred directly from home, IHT patients (n = 28,517) had higher odds of readmission [odds ratio (OR): 1.004, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.002-1.006), P < 0.001], major complication [adjusted OR: 1.119, 95% CI (1.117-1.121), P < 0.001), minor complication [OR: 1.078, 95% CI (1.075-1.080), P < 0.001], and reoperation [OR: 1.014, 95% CI (1.013-1.015), P < 0.001]. In all EGS procedures, Black patients had greater odds of minor complication [OR 1.041, 95% CI (1.023-1.060), P < 0.001], Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander patients had greater odds of readmission [OR 1.081, 95% CI (1.008-1.160), P = 0.030], while Asian and Hispanic patients had lower odds of adverse outcome, and female patients had greater odds of minor complication [OR 1.017, 95% CI (1.008-1.027), P < 0.001]. Procedure-specific racial and sex-related disparities exist in emergency general surgery patients who underwent interhospital transfer. Specific interventions should be implemented to address these disparities to improve the safety of emergency procedures."

    "abstract": "Surgical emergencies are time sensitive. Identifying patients who may benefit from preoperative goals of care discussions is critical to ensuring that operative intervention aligns with the patient's values. We sought to identify patient factors associated with acute changes in a patient's goals using code status change (CSC) as proxy. A retrospective analysis of single-institution data for patients undergoing urgent laparotomy was performed. Patients were stratified based on whether a postoperative CSC occurred. Parametric, nonparametric, and regression analyses were used to identify variables associated with CSC. Of 484 patients, 13.8% (n = 67) had a postoperative CSC. Patients with postoperative CSC were older (65 versus 60 years, P < 0.001). Odds of CSC were significantly higher in patients who were transferred between facilities (odds ratio [OR] 2.1), had a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (3-4: OR 3.9, 5+: OR 6.8), and had a higher quick sequential organ failure assessment score (2: OR 5.0; 3: OR 38.7). Patients with anemia (OR 1.9) and active cancer (OR 3.0) had higher odds of CSC. Timely intervention in emergency general surgery may result in high-risk interventions and subsequent complications that do not align with a patient's goals and values. Our analysis identified a subset of patients who undergo surgery and have a postoperative CSC leading to transition to comfort-focused care. In these patients, a pause in clinical momentum may help ensure operative intervention remains goal concordant."

    "abstract": "The burden of emergency general surgery (EGS) is higher compared to elective surgery. Acute appendicitis (AA) is one of the most frequent diseases and its management is dictated by published international clinical practice guidelines (CPG). Adherence to CPG has been reported as heterogeneous. Barriers to clinical implementation were not studied. This study explored barriers to adherence to CPG and the clinico-economic impact of poor compliance. Data were extracted from the three-year data lock of the REsiDENT-1 registry, a prospective resident-led multicenter trial. We identified 7 items from CPG published from the European Association of Endoscopic Surgery (EAES) and the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES). We applied our classification proposal and used a five-point Likert scale (Ls) to assess laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) difficulty. Descriptive analyses were performed to explore compliance and group comparisons to assess the impact on outcomes and related costs. We ran logistic regressions to identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of CPG. From 2019 to 2022, 653 LA were included from 24 centers. 69 residents performed and coordinated data collection. We identified low compliance with recommendations on peritoneal irrigation (PI) (25.73%), abdominal drains (AD) (34.68%), and antibiotic stewardship (34.17%). Poor compliance on PI and AD was associated to higher infectious complications in uncomplicated AA. Hospitalizations were significantly longer in non-compliance except for PI in uncomplicated AA, and costs significantly higher, exception made for antibiotic stewardship in complicated AA. The strongest barriers to CPG implementation were complicated AA and technically challenging LA for PI and AD. Longer operative times and the use of PI negatively affected antibiotic stewardship in uncomplicated AA. Compliance was higher in teaching hospitals and in emergency surgery units. We confirmed low compliance with standardized items influenced by environmental factors and non-evidence-based practices in complex LA. Antibiotic stewardship is sub-optimal. Not following CPG may not influence clinical complications but has an impact in terms of logistics, costs and on the non-measurable magnitude of antibiotic resistance. Structured educational interventions and institutional bundles are required."

    "abstract": "Patients with necrotizing soft tissue infection undergo an average of 4-5 debridements per hospital admission. Optimal timing for initial debridement is emergent. Second debridement is universally recommended to occur within 24 hours of the first, but no studies have successfully evaluated this time frame. Prior work has suggested that delays in second debridement are associated with increased mortality, and that few patients receive second debridement within 24 hours. We performed a retrospective cohort study at a single center from 01/01/08 to 09/01/2021. The explanatory variable was whether the subject received second debridement within 24 hours of initial debridement. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Baseline characteristics were collected. Subjects were stratified into 2 groups by time between first and second debridement: <24 and ≥24 hours. Variables were compared using Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. 77 patients met inclusion criteria. The median overall time to second debridement was 40 hours. 12 subjects received second debridement within 24 hours (15.6%). There was no difference in in-hospital mortality between the <24 (n = 3, 25.0%) and ≥24-hour second debridement groups (n = 4, 6.2%; P = .07). The 2 groups did not differ by secondary outcomes, including total number of debridements, ICU LOS, or wound closure. No difference in mortality was observed between subjects undergoing second debridement within 24 vs after 24 hours. Only 16% of subjects received second debridement within the recommended 24-hour time interval. Further study is required to identify the optimal timing of second debridement."

Emergency physicians and surgeons are expected to perform this procedure in the Emergency Department. However, the procedure has a low occurrence rate, therefore physicians are often poorly prepared. Current teaching methods include expensive simulators and anatomically inaccurate animal models. The goal of this study was to design, produce and test, a low-cost, high-fidelity model for the teaching of CST. The model was produced from inexpensive, commercially available materials as well as ADAMgel; a custom, recyclable, inexpensive tissue analogue. The model was tested across 19 physicians, mostly consultants and senior registrars in emergency medicine, anaesthesia and surgery. Participants completed comparative questionnaires before and after testing the model. The questionnaires were adapted from previous anaesthetic-based simulation studies and used a modified Likert scale to assess prior knowledge, anatomical realism and the teaching benefits of the model. Participants had varied prior knowledge and experience before testing the model. Results showed that 89.47% (n = 17) of trainees felt the model was a reasonable substitute for practice and 100% (n = 19) agreed that the model was a good training aid for inexperienced trainees and would recommend it to others. The model proved a successful teaching tool, improving physicians' knowledge and confidence with performing CST. This high fidelity, low cost model demonstrated that a high standard simulation teaching tool can be made which improves teaching of CST."

To better understand the shift to an aging population in the United States, identifying how age may influence these complications in older patients is important. The current standard age category for older adult patients is ≥65. We analyzed postlaparotomy complications using a lower age split. A retrospective analysis was done on patients who required an EEL from October 2015 to December 2019 at an academic medical center. Patient demographics and hospital course variables were collected. Differences in complications in patients aged ≥/<55 y and ≥/<65 y were measured using univariate and multivariable analyses. A total of 481 patients were reviewed. Both patient groups of ≥55 and ≥65 were typically male, White, had 3+ comorbidities, Medicare insurance, were retired, and presented in extremis to the emergency department. Patients aged ≥55 y had significant rates of pulmonary complications and inpatient mortality (odds ratio 2.2, 2.7, respectively). Patients aged ≥65 y had significant rates of genitourinary and cardiac complications (odds ratio 2.3, 1.8, respectively). Patients aged ≥55 y undergoing EEL had higher odds of experiencing pulmonary complications and death during their index hospitalizations, which was not present with the standard ≥/<65-y-old patient analysis. Those aged ≥65 y experienced index genitourinary and cardiac complications. The ≥/<55 age split has a unique set of complications that should be considered. Given the increased odds of inpatient mortality and types of complications in patients aged ≥55 y, the current age split for older adults should be reconsidered."

    "abstract": "Patients with Acute Care Surgery needs (ie, emergency general surgery diagnosis or trauma admission) are at particularly high risk for nonmedical patient-related factors that can be important drivers of healthcare outcomes. These social determinants of health are typically ascertained at the geographic area level (ie, county or neighborhood) rather than at the individual patient level. Recently, the International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision, Tenth Edition created codes to capture health hazards related to patient socioeconomic and psychosocial circumstances. We sought to characterize the impact of these social determinants of health-related codes on perioperative outcomes among patients with acute care surgery needs. Patients diagnosed between 2017 and 2020 with acute care surgery needs (ie, emergency general surgery diagnosis or a trauma admission) were identified in the California Department of Healthcare Access and information Patient Discharge database. Data on concomitant social determinants of health-related codes (International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision, Tenth Edition Z55-Z65), which designated health hazards related to socioeconomic and psychosocial (socioeconomic and psychosocial, respectively) circumstances, were obtained. After controlling for patient factors, including age, sex, race, payer type, and admitting hospital, the association of socioeconomic and psychosocial codes with perioperative outcomes and hospital disposition was analyzed. Among 483,280 with an acute care surgery admission (emergency general surgery: n = 289,530, 59.9%; trauma: n = 193,705, 40.1%) mean age was 56.5 years (standard deviation: 21.5) and 271,911 (56.3%) individuals were male. Overall, 16,263 (3.4%) patients had a concomitant socioeconomic and psychosocial diagnosis code. The percentage of patients with a concurrent social determinants of health International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision, Tenth Edition diagnosis increased throughout the study period from 2.6% in 2017 to 4.4% in 2020. Patients that were male (odds ratio 1.89; 95% confidence interval 1.82, 1.96), insured by Medicaid (odds ratio 5.43; 95% confidence interval 5.15, 5.72) or self-pay (odds ratio 3.04; 95% confidence interval 2.75, 3.36) all had higher odds of having an social determinants of health International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision, Tenth Edition diagnosis. Black race did not have a significant association with an social determinants of health International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision, Tenth Edition diagnosis (odds ratio 0.99; 95% confidence interval 0.94, 1.04); however, Hispanic (odds ratio 0.44; 95% confidence interval 0.43, 0.46) and Asian (odds ratio 0.40; 95% confidence interval 0.36, 0.44) race/ethnicity was associated with a lower odds of having an social determinants of health International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision, Tenth Edition diagnosis. After controlling for competing risk factors on multivariable analyses, the risk-adjusted probability of hospital postoperative death was 3.1% (95% confidence interval 2.8, 3.4) among patients with a social determinants of health diagnosis versus 5.9% (95% confidence interval 5.9, 6.0) (odds ratio 0.48; 95% confidence interval 0.44, 0.54) among patients without a social determinants of health diagnosis. Risk-adjusted complications were 26.7% (95% confidence interval 26.1, 37.3) among patients with a social determinants of health diagnosis compared with 31.9% (95% confidence interval 31.7, 32.0) (odds ratio 0.74; 95% confidence interval 0.71, 0.77) among patients without a social determinants of health diagnosis. International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision, Tenth Edition social determinants of health code use was low, with only 3.4% of patients having documentation of a socioeconomic and psychosocial circumstance. The presence of an International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision, Tenth Edition social determinants of health code was not associated with greater odds of complications or death; however, it was associated with longer length of stay and higher odds of being discharged to a skilled nursing facility."

    "abstract": "The identification of new prognostic tools for the prediction of burn patients' morbidity outcomes is necessary. Considering the feasibility of frailty assessment in the clinical setting, we aim to systematically review the literature on the associations between frailty and adverse outcomes in burn patients. Studies were retrieved from MEDLINE (through PubMed), Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase from their inception up to 8 September 2022. Included studies were those that used frailty indices to predict adverse outcomes in burn patients. The quality assessment was done using the National, Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) checklist. The results were synthesized narratively. We included 18 studies. The sample size among the included studies varied between 42-1615 patients. There were 12 research articles and 6 conference abstracts. Most of the studies were recently published in 2021 and 2022. Seven different frailty measures were evaluated. The following frailty measures were used: Canadian Study for Health and Ageing (CSHA) Clinical Frailty score (CFS), Modified frailty index-11 (mFI-11), Hospital frailty index, FRAIL scale, Emergency General Surgery Frailty Index (EGSFI), and Burn frailty index (BFI). There was only one report regarding a specific frailty index designed for the burn population (BFI). Except for one study (which used mFI-11), all included studies have shown a significant effect between assessing frailty and predicting worse outcomes. The CFS was an independent predictor of mortality among the burn population with high certainty of evidence. We found a significant association for other frailty indices as a predictor of mortality, however, the certainty of evidence regarding those was not high. Eight studies found a positive association between assessing frailty and unfavorable discharge location. There was no association between frailty and increased length of stay. In conclusion, the postadmission assessment of frailty can be a reliable tool for predicting unfavorable outcomes and mortalities among patients with burn injuries. In addition, future studies with various populations from other countries are required to evaluate the efficacy of frailty indices measurement in order to strengthen the available evidence."

This study explores the current trends in patient outcomes and cost of robotic emergency general surgery (REGS). The Florida Agency for Healthcare Administration database (2018-2020) was queried for adult patients undergoing intra-abdominal emergency general surgery within 24 h of admission and linked to CMS Cost Reports/Hospital Compare, American Hospital Association, and Rand Corporation Hospital datasets. Patients from the four most common REGS procedures were propensity matched to laparoscopic equivalents for hospital cost analysis. A telephone survey was performed with the top 10 REGS hospitals to identify key qualities for successful REGS programs. 181 hospitals (119 REGS, 62 non-REGS) performed 60,733 emergency surgeries. Six-percent were REGS. The most common REGS were cholecystectomy, appendectomy, inguinal and ventral hernia repairs. Before and after propensity matching, total cost for these four procedures were significantly higher than their laparoscopic equivalents, which was due to higher surgical cost as the non-operative costs did not differ. There were no differences in mortality, individual complications, or length of stay for most of the four procedures. REGS volume significantly increased each year. The survey found that 8/10 hospitals have robotic-trained staff available 24/7. Although REGS volume is increasing in Florida, cost remains significantly higher than laparoscopy. Given higher costs and lack of significantly improved outcomes, further study should be undertaken to better inform which specific patient populations would benefit from REGS."

    "abstract": "Many emergency general surgery (EGS) conditions can be managed operatively or nonoperatively, with outcomes that vary by diagnosis. We hypothesized that operative management would lead to higher in-hospital costs but to cost savings over time. EGS conditions account for $28 billion in health care costs in the United States annually. Compared with scheduled surgery, patients who undergo emergency surgery are at increased risk of complications, readmissions, and death, with accompanying costs of care that are up to 50% higher than elective surgery. Our prior work demonstrated that operative management had variable impacts on clinical outcomes depending on the EGS condition. This was a nationwide, retrospective study using fee-for-service Medicare claims data. We included patients 65.5 years of age or older with a principal diagnosis for an EGS condition 7/1/2015-6/30/2018. EGS conditions were categorized as: colorectal, general abdominal, hepatopancreaticobiliary (HPB), intestinal obstruction, and upper gastrointestinal. We used near-far matching with a preference-based instrumental variable to adjust for confounding and selection bias. Outcomes included Medicare payments for the index hospitalization and at 30, 90, and 180 days. Of 507,677 patients, 30.6% received an operation. For HPB conditions, costs for operative management were initially higher but became equivalent at 90 and 180 days. For all others, operative management was associated with higher inpatient costs, which persisted, though narrowed, over time. Out-of-pocket costs were nearly equivalent for operative and nonoperative management. Compared with nonoperative management, costs were higher or equivalent for operative management of EGS conditions through 180 days, which could impact decision-making for clinicians, patients, and health systems in situations where clinical outcomes are similar."

There is a lack of standardization for opioid prescribing for acute surgical pain in emergency general surgery (EGS) patients. We hypothesized that implementing a guideline to standardize opioid prescribing would be associated with a decrease in prescribing at hospital discharge for EGS patients without increasing additional postdischarge refills. This was a quasi-experimental study evaluating opioid prescribing by EGS providers before and after the implementation of a prescribing guideline. Patients were assigned to preguideline and postguideline groups based on admission date surrounding the implementation of the guideline. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients receiving an opioid prescription for ≥50 Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) per day on hospital discharge. There were 227 patients in the preguideline group and 226 patients in the postguideline group. After guideline implementation, median total MME prescribed decreased from 113 (interquartile range = 75) to 75 (interquartile range = 75, P = 0.03). The proportion of patients receiving a prescription for daily MME ≥50 also decreased from 75% to 25% (P ≤0.01). There were no increases in requested refills (17% versus 16%, P = 0.72) or received refills (14% versus 14%, P = 0.98). Guideline compliance ranged from 75% in ventral hernia repair patients to 94% in laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients. A departmental guideline to standardize postoperative opioid prescriptions was associated with a decrease in the amount of MMEs prescribed to EGS patients without an increase in requested or received refills."

Our study aimed to determine the association of obesity with postoperative outcomes in patients requiring emergency VHR. Our retrospective study used the 2016-2020 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database to identify patients undergoing emergency VHR. Patients were classified by body mass index (BMI): normal weight 18.5-24.9 kg/m2, overweight 25-29.9 kg/m2, obesity 30-39.9 kg/m2, morbid obesity 40-49.9 kg/m2, and super morbid obesity (SMO) ≥50 kg/m2. The primary outcome of interest was surgical site infection (SSI). From 2016 to 2020, a total 11,593 patients underwent emergency VHR. Patients with higher BMI had increased incidences of postoperative complications. Compared to other patients with obesity, SMO patients had higher rates of SSI (11.5% versus 5.5%, P < 0.001), prolonged ventilatory support (4.0% versus 1.5%, P < 0.001), length of stay ≥4 d (52.7% versus 42.2%, P < 0.001), reoperation (6.4% versus 3.4%, P < 0.001), and readmission (11.3% versus 7.2%, P < 0.001). Super morbid obesity (SMO) patients had increased odds of SSI (odds ratio [OR] 5.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.47-8.88), prolonged ventilatory support (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.07-3.45), and reoperation (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.26-3.09) compared to normal weight patients. Patients with BMI ≥50 kg/m2 undergoing emergency VHR have increased overall incidences of SSIs, prolonged mechanical ventilation, reoperation, and readmission, and this remains significant when compared to other patients with obesity. This population is at significant risk for postoperative morbidity, and increased vigilance in perioperative management is imperative to ensure safe, high-quality care."

A retrospective observational study of all emergent EL whose subcutaneous tissue were irrigated with 0.05% CHG solution to achieve primary wound closure from March 2021 to June 2022 were performed. Patients with active soft-tissue infection of the abdominal wall were excluded. Our primary outcome is rate of primary skin closure following laparotomy. Descriptive statistics, including t-test and chi-square test, were used to compare groups as appropriate. A P value <0.05 was statistically significant. Sixty-six patients with a median age of 51 y (18-92 y) underwent emergent EL. Primary wound closure is achieved in 98.5% of patients (65/66). Bedside removal of some staples and conversion to wet-to-dry packing changes was required in 27.3% of patients (18/66). We found that most of these were due to fat necrosis. We report no cases of fascial dehiscence. In patients undergoing EL, intraoperative irrigation of the subcutaneous tissue with 0.05% CHG solution is a viable option for primary skin closure. Further studies are needed to prospectively evaluate our findings."

    "abstract": "Work-relative-value-units (wRVUs) are a core metric of faculty effort but do not account for the additional work associated with intraoperative teaching. This study introduces and assesses an indexed effort, wRVU per minute (wRVU index). We hypothesize that there is a significant decrease in the calculated wRVU index among teaching cases. We queried the ACS-NSQIP database for 7 core Emergency General Surgery procedures and records were stratified into teaching vs non-teaching, and emergent vs non-emergent procedures. We utilized multivariable generalized linear models to determine factors associated with increased operative time and decreased wRVU index. Data were available for 953,967 cases from 2005 to 2010. For all cases, teaching vs non-teaching, the median wRVU index was 0.16 vs 0.21 (p ​< ​0.001). There was a positive association between teaching cases and decreased wRVU index for all cases. The wRVU index was 24% lower for teaching cases when compared to non-teaching cases despite controlling for patient-specific factors. This finding highlights the need for further evaluation of the current wRVU framework."

Despite a large difference in the characteristics of patients with a mortality risk score of between 5% and 50%, these outcomes are aggregated by the National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA). Our aim was to describe the outcomes of the cohort of patients at extreme risk of death, which we defined as having a NELA-predicted 30-day mortality of ≥ 50%. All patients enrolled in the NELA database between December 2012 and 2020 were included. We compared patient characteristics; length of hospital stay; rates of unplanned return to the operating theatre; and 90-day survival in extreme-risk groups (predicted ≥ 50%) and high-risk patients (predicted 5-49%). Of 161,337 patients, 5193 (3.2%) had a predicted mortality of ≥ 50%. When patients were further subdivided, 2437 (47%) had predicted mortality of 50-59% (group 50-59); 1484 (29%) predicted mortality of 60-69% (group 60-69); 840 (16%) predicted mortality of 70-79% (group 70-79); and 423 (8%) predicted mortality of ≥ 80% (group 80+). Extreme-risk patients were significantly more likely to have been admitted electively than high-risk patients (p < 0.001). Length of stay increased from a median (IQR [range]) of 26 (16-43 [0-271]) days in group 50-59 to 35 (21-56 [0-368]) days in group 80+, compared with 17 (10-30 [0-1136]) days for high-risk patients. Rates of unplanned return to the operating theatre were higher in extreme-risk groups compared with high-risk patients (11% vs. 8%). The 90-day survival was 43% in group 50-59, 34% in group 60-69, 27% in group 70-79 and 17% in group 80+. These data underscore the need for a differentiated approach when discussing risk with patients at extreme risk of mortality following an emergency laparotomy. Clinicians should focus on patient priorities on quantity and quality of life during informed consent discussions before surgery. Future work should extend beyond the immediate postoperative period to encompass the longer-term outcomes (survival and function) of patients who have emergency laparotomies."

    "abstract": "The benefit of primary care physician (PCP) follow-up as a potential means to reduce readmissions in hospitalized patients has been found in other medical conditions and among patients receiving high-risk surgery. However, little is known about the implications of PCP follow-up for patients with an emergency general surgery (EGS) condition. To evaluate the association between PCP follow-up and 30-day readmission rates after hospital discharge for an EGS condition. This cohort study used data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Master Beneficiary Summary File, Inpatient, Carrier (Part B), and Durable Medical Equipment files for beneficiaries aged 66 years or older who were hospitalized with an EGS condition that was managed operatively or nonoperatively between September 1, 2016, and November 30, 2018. Eligible patients were enrolled in Medicare fee-for-service, admitted through the emergency department with a primary diagnosis of an EGS condition, and received a general surgery consultation during the admission. Data were analyzed between July 11, 2022, and June 5, 2023. Follow-up with a PCP within 30 days after hospital discharge for the index admission. The primary outcome was readmission within 30 days after discharge for the index admission. An inverse probability weighted regression model was used to estimate the risk-adjusted association of PCP follow-up with 30-day readmission. The secondary outcome was readmission within 30 days after discharge stratified by treatment type (operative vs nonoperative treatment) during their index admission. The study included 345 360 Medicare beneficiaries (mean [SD] age, 74.4 [12.0] years; 187 804 females [54.4%]) hospitalized with an EGS condition. Of these, 156 820 patients (45.4%) had a follow-up PCP visit, 108 544 (31.4%) received operative treatment during their index admission, and 236 816 (68.6%) received nonoperative treatment. Overall, 58 253 of 332 874 patients (17.5%) were readmitted within 30 days after discharge for the index admission. After risk adjustment and propensity weighting, patients who had PCP follow-up had 67% lower odds of readmission (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.33; 95% CI, 0.31-0.36) compared with patients without PCP follow-up. After stratifying by treatment type, patients who were treated operatively during their index admission and had subsequent PCP follow-up within 30 days after discharge had 79% reduced odds of readmission (AOR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.18-0.25); a similar association was seen among patients who were treated nonoperatively (AOR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.34-0.39). Infectious conditions, heart failure, acute kidney failure, and chronic kidney disease were among the most frequent diagnoses prompting readmission overall and among operative and nonoperative treatment groups. In this cohort study, follow-up with a PCP within 30 days after discharge for an EGS condition was associated with a significant reduction in the adjusted odds of 30-day readmission. This association was similar for patients who received operative care or nonoperative care during their index admission. In patients aged 66 years or older with an EGS condition, primary care coordination after discharge may be an important tool to reduce readmissions."

    "abstract": "The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma and the American College of Surgeons have recently introduced emergency general surgery (EGS) center verification, which could enhance patient outcomes. Distance and resource availability may affect access to these centers, which has been linked to higher mortality. Although many patients can receive adequate care at community centers, those with critical conditions may require specialized treatment at EGS-verified centers. We aimed to evaluate geospatial access to potential EGS-verified centers and identify disparities across different scenarios of EGS verification program uptake in the United States. We used hospital capabilities and verified pilot centers to estimate potential patterns of which centers would become EGS verified under four scenarios (EGS centers, high-volume EGS centers, high-volume EGS plus level 1 trauma centers, and quaternary referral centers). We calculated the spatial accessibility index using an enhanced two-step floating catchment technique to determine geospatial access for each scenario. We also evaluated social determinants of health across geospatial access using the Area Deprivation Index (ADI). A total of 1,932 hospitals were categorized as EGS centers, 307 as high-volume EGS centers, 401 as high-volume EGS plus level 1trauma centers, and 146 as quaternary centers. Spatial accessibility index decreased as the stringency of EGS verification increased in each scenario (226.6 [111.7-330.7], 51.8 [0-126.1], 71.52 [3.34-164.56], 6.2 [0-62.2]; p < 0.001). Within each scenario, spatial accessibility index also declined as the ADI quartile increased ( p < 0.001). The high-volume EGS plus level 1trauma center scenario had the most significant disparity in access between the first and fourth ADI quartiles (-54.68). Access to EGS-verified centers may vary considerably based on the program's implementation. Disadvantaged communities may be disproportionately affected by limited access. Further work to study regional needs can allow a strategic implementation of the EGS verification program to optimize outcomes while minimizing disparities. Prognostic and Epidemiological; Level IV."

The aim of this study was to examine the current methods of defining and determining malnutrition in emergency general surgery. This included examining the use of nutrition screening and assessment tools and other measures of malnutrition. MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, trial registries, and relevant journals published between January 2000 and January 2022 were searched for studies of adult patients with any emergency general surgery diagnosis, managed conservatively or operatively, with an assessment of nutritional status. Mixed populations were included if more than 50 per cent of patients were emergency general surgery patients or emergency general surgery results could be separately extracted. Studies in which patients had received nutritional support were excluded. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO, the international prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42021285897). From 6700 studies screened, 324 full texts were retrieved and 31 were included in the analysis. A definition of malnutrition was provided in 23 studies (75 per cent), with nutritional status being determined by a variety of methods. A total of seven nutrition screening tools and a total of nine 'assessment' tools were reported. To define malnutrition, the most commonly used primary or secondary marker of nutritional status was BMI, followed by albumin level. Wide variation exists in approaches to identify malnutrition risk in emergency general surgery patients, using a range of tools and nutrition markers. Future studies should seek to standardize nutrition screening and assessment in the emergency general surgery setting as two discrete processes. This will permit better understanding of malnutrition risk in surgical patients."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) encompasses a wide range of acute surgical conditions that pose significant risks to patient life and well-being. Understanding the factors that contribute to short-term complications in geriatric patients undergoing EGS is crucial for improving patient outcomes. This retrospective single-center cohort study aimed to evaluate the impact of various variables on short-term complications in geriatric patients undergoing EGS. A total of 212 patients aged 65 and above who underwent emergency abdominal surgery between 2017 and 2018 were included in the study. The analysis focused on several variables, including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), beta-blocker use, open abdomen treatment, blood transfusions, anticoagulant therapy, and vasopressor use. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to assess the association between these variables and short-term complications. Among the analyzed variables, blood transfusions and vasopressor use demonstrated a statistically significant association with short-term complications. Patients who received blood transfusions had a significantly higher risk of complications, with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.01 (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.28-7.06, p-value = 0.011). Similarly, the use of vasopressors was strongly correlated with increased short-term complications, with an OR of 14.61 (95% CI: 4.86-43.89, p-value < 0.001). These findings emphasize the importance of minimizing blood transfusions and careful consideration of vasopressor use in geriatric patients undergoing EGS to reduce the risk of short-term complications. Further research is warranted to explore additional factors and optimize perioperative management strategies to improve outcomes in this vulnerable patient population."

    "abstract": "Fluorescence-based imaging has found application in several fields of elective surgery, but there is still a lack of evidence in the literature about its use in emergency setting. The present review critically summarizes currently available applications and limitations of indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence in abdominal emergencies including acute cholecystitis, mesenteric ischemia, and trauma surgery. A systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA statement identifying articles about the use of ICG fluorescence in the management of the most common general surgery emergency. Only studies focusing on the use of ICG fluorescence for the management of acute surgical conditions in adults were included. Thirty-six articles were considered for qualitative analysis. The most frequent disease was occlusive or non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia followed by acute cholecystitis. Benefits from using ICG for acute cholecystitis were reported in 48% of cases (clear identification of biliary structures and a safer surgical procedure). In one hundred and twenty cases that concerned the use of ICG for occlusive or non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia, ICG injection led to a modification of the surgical decision in 44 patients (36.6%). Three studies evaluated the use of ICG in trauma patients to assess the viability of bowel or parenchymatous organs in abdominal trauma, to evaluate the perfusion-related tissue impairment in extremity or craniofacial trauma, and to reassess the efficacy of surgical procedures performed in terms of vascularization. ICG injection led to a modification of the surgical decision in 50 patients (23.9%). ICG fluorescence is a safe and feasible tool also in an emergency setting. There is increasing evidence that the use of ICG fluorescence during abdominal surgery could facilitate intra-operative decision-making and improve patient outcomes, even in the field of emergency surgery."

Approximately 25% will require emergency surgical intervention, half will sustain a postoperative complication, and 15% will have a readmission within the first 30 days of surgery. In the face of this growing public health burden and to better meet the needs of these acutely ill patients, it was recognized that a formal quality improvement program, including standardization of data collection and the development of systems of care specifically for EGS have been lacking. Establishing standardized processes for quality improvement, including a national databank, and maintaining adherence to these processes as ensured by a robust verification process has improved outcomes research and patient care in the field of trauma, another time-sensitive specialty. In response to this perceived deficit, the \"Optimal Resources for Emergency General Surgery\" was developed. An extension of the current National Surgical Quality Improvement Program platform, specifically for operative and non-operative EGS cases, was developed and implemented. A robust set of standards were outlined to verify EGS programs/services. Defining the elements of an effective EGS program and developing hospital and practice standards consolidated EGS as an integral component of Acute Care Surgery. The verification program addresses a societal need and allows hospitals to better organize EGS care delivery and benchmark their results nationally."

Patients and Methods: Post hoc analysis of the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) Multicenter Study of the Treatment of Appendicitis in America: Acute, Perforated and Gangrenous (MUSTANG) prospective appendicitis database was performed. All adults (age >18) undergoing appendectomy were stratified by final operative approach: laparoscopic or open appendectomy (including conversion from laparoscopic). Univariable analysis was performed to compare group characteristics and outcomes, and multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify demographic, clinical, or radiologic factors associated with open appendectomy. Results: A total of 3,019 cases were analyzed. One hundred seventy-five (5.8%) patients underwent open appendectomy, including 127 converted from laparoscopic to open. The median age was 37 (25) years and 53% were male. Compared with the laparoscopic group, open appendectomy patients had more comorbidities, higher proportion of symptoms greater than 96 hours, and higher AAST EGS grade. Moreover, on intraoperative findings, the open appendectomy group had a higher incidence of perforated and gangrenous appendicitis with purulent contamination, abscess/phlegmon, and purulent abdominal/pelvic fluid. On multivariable analysis controlling for comorbidities, clinical and imaging AAST grade, duration of symptoms, and intra-operative findings, only AAST Clinical Grade 5 appendicitis was independently associated with open appendectomy (odds ratio [OR], 5.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-25.55; p = 0.025).

Psychiatric comorbidity can impact medical treatment adherence, cost, and premature mortality risk. Despite the severity of illness in EGS, there is limited research on psychiatric comorbidity in EGS patients. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to characterize EGS patient mental health and to assess its relationship with pain, social support, and healthcare utilization (ie, length of stay, readmission). Adult EGS patients were screened for participation during hospitalization. Inclusion criteria included: (1) 18 years or older, (2) communicate fluently in English, and (3) assessed within 7 days of admission. Participants (n=95) completed assessment, which included a structured clinical diagnostic interview. Record review captured medical variables, including length of stay, discharge disposition, narcotic prescription, and 90-day readmission rates. Ninety-five patients completed the assessment, and 31.6% met criteria for at least one current psychiatric diagnosis; 21.3% with a major depressive episode, 9.6% with a substance use disorder, and 7.5% with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Lower perceived social support and greater pain severity and interference were significantly related to more severe depression and anxiety. Depression was associated with longer length of stay, and those with PTSD were more likely to be re-admitted.

Univariate comparisons were performed using Kruskal-Wallis tests and risk-adjusted HFDs were compared between multimorbid and nonmultimorbid patients using multivariable zero-inflated negative binomial regression models. Among 174,891 operative patients, 45.5% were multimorbid. Among 398,756 nonoperative patients, 59.2% were multimorbid. Multimorbid patients had fewer median HFDs than nonmultimorbid patients among operative and nonoperative cohorts (P < 0.001).

Methods The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) was utilized to collect data regarding rectal foreign bodies. Ten years of data were collected from 2012 to 2021. Inclusion criteria focused on the diagnosis of \"foreign body\" coupled with pelvic and lower torso injuries. Exclusion criteria encompassed patients without a rectal foreign body clearly identified in the narrative. Patients were compared based on disposition as low severity (treated/examined and released or left without being seen) or high severity (treated and admitted/hospitalized, held for observation, or transferred to another facility). General descriptive and inferential analyses were performed regarding demographics and dispositions. Results A total of 1,806 emergency department (ED) visits were identified for inclusion.

The most common foreign bodies were massage devices and vibrators (22.7%), jewelry (8.1%), pens and pencils (4.4%), fishing gears (activity, apparel, or equipment) (3.7%), and nonglass bottles or jars (2.6%). Patients requiring admission, observation, or transfer differed from those patients that were discharged from the ED by age, sex, race, and product involved. Discussion Rectal foreign bodies are a rare diagnosis with a growing incidence. Though the most common objects are massage devices and vibrators consistent with sexual stimulation devices, there are limited product guidelines for safe use. Further studies to help identify at-risk persons, safety precautions, and manufacturing guidelines may help prevent potential morbidity associated with rectal foreign bodies."

    "title": "The Association of Mental Illness With Outcomes of Emergency Surgery for Bowel Obstruction.",
    "abstract": "Bowel obstruction is one of the most common surgical emergencies. The management of SBO is variable and influenced by numerous confounding factors. Recent studies have identified mental health as a health disparity that affects surgical outcomes. We aim to assess whether mental illness is a health disparity and its association with postoperative complications and secondary outcomes for bowel obstruction in Emergency General Surgery (EGS). This was a retrospective study utilizing the National Inpatient Sample. Individuals aged 18-64 who underwent emergency adehesiolysis or bowel resection from 2015 to 2017 were identified. Postoperative complications, in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and total cost for surgical patients with and without mental illness were recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the association between mental health and bowel obstruction. 20,574 patients who underwent surgery for bowel obstruction were identified. 3756 of these patients had mental illness and 16,998 patients did not. Patients with mental illness did not have significantly worse outcomes compared to patients without mental illness. Among 3576 patients with mental illness, sex, race, patient location, insurance, location/teaching status of hospital, hospital control and procedure type were significant predictors of prolonged length of stay, higher cost, and increased postoperative complications. Mental health does not appear to be a health disparity in outcomes for bowel obstruction procedures. However, the intersection of mental health with race and insurance status predicts worse outcomes. This essential area should be further explored to determine how marginalized populations are affected in emergency surgical care."

    "abstract": "Older age is associated with increased prevalence of both diverticulitis and cognitive impairment. The association between cognitive impairment and outcomes among older adults presenting to the emergency department (ED) for diverticulitis is unknown. Adults aged ≥65 y presenting to an ED with a primary diagnosis of colonic diverticulitis were identified using the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (2016-2019) and stratified by cognitive impairment status in this retrospective cohort study. Multivariable Poisson regression models adjusted for patient age, sex, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, primary payer status, and presence of complicated diverticulitis quantified relative risk of a) inpatient admission, b) operative intervention, and c) in-hospital mortality comparing patients with or without a diagnosis code suggestive of cognitive impairment. Among 683,444 older adults with an ED encounter for diverticulitis from 2016 to 2019, there were 468,226 patients with isolated colonic diverticulitis and 26,388 (5.6%) with comorbid cognitive impairment. After adjustment, the risk of inpatient admission for those with cognitive impairment was 18% higher than for those without cognitive impairment (adjusted relative risks [aRR]: 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17-1.20). Those with cognitive impairment were 34% more likely to undergo colectomy than those without cognitive impairment (aRR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.24-1.44). Older adults with cognitive impairment had a 32% greater mortality than those without cognitive impairment (aRR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.05-1.67). Among older adults presenting for ED care with a primary diagnosis of colonic diverticulitis, individuals with cognitive impairment had higher rates of hospitalization, operative intervention, and in-hospital mortality than those without cognitive impairment."

    "abstract": "Background: The impact of fecal contamination on clinical outcomes in patients undergoing emergent colorectal resection is unclear. We hypothesized that fecal contamination is associated with worse clinical outcomes regardless of operative technique. Patients and Methods: This is a post hoc analysis for an Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma-sponsored multicenter study that prospectively enrolled emergency general surgery patients undergoing urgent/emergent colorectal resection. Subjects were categorized according to presence versus absence of intra-operative fecal contamination. Propensity score matching (1:1) by age, weight, Charlson comorbidity index, pre-operative vasopressor use, and method of colonic management (primary anastomosis [ANST] vs. ostomy [STM]) was performed. χ2 analysis was then performed to compare the composite outcome (surgical site infection and fascial dehiscence). Results: A total of 428 subjects were included, of whom 147 (34%) had fecal contamination. Propensity score matching (1:1) resulted in a total of 147 pairs. After controlling for operative technique, fecal contamination was still associated with higher odds of the composite outcome (odds ratio [OR], 2.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.45-4.2; p = 0.001). Conclusions: In patients undergoing urgent/emergent colorectal resection, fecal contamination, regardless of operative technique, is associated with worse clinical outcomes. Selection bias is possible, thus randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm or refute a causal relation."

    "abstract": "Current casualty care training modalities present several challenges, including limited simulation facilities, instructor dependence, lack of standardization, documentation of trainees' performance and training personalization. The study presents the design, development and preliminary evaluation of a novel hybrid training platform to address these challenges. A mixed reality platform was chosen and developed to address field operators' requirements. The platform is easy to operate and can be set up by laypeople within 20-min in multiple environments. Individual-level training documentation is generated autonomously following each session, evaluating 30 aspects of performance. From this, a unique aggregated dataset emerges as a substrate for executives' dashboards and intelligent planning of future sessions. An evaluation process took part using simulator-based training in different stages along the project using a questionnaire (Likert-scale based). Fifty military physicians took part in an identical head injury scenario requiring airway management by endotracheal intubation and were immediately surveyed. TrauMR is an agile hybrid training that harbors the potential to address many of the emerging challenges of training for prehospital care in combat and civilian environments."

    "abstract": "Intra-abdominal infections (IAI) are among the most common global healthcare challenges and they are usually precipitated by disruption to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Their successful management typically requires intensive resource utilization, and despite the best therapies, morbidity and mortality remain high. One of the main issues required to appropriately treat IAI that differs from the other etiologies of sepsis is the frequent requirement to provide physical source control. Fortunately, dramatic advances have been made in this aspect of treatment. Historically, source control was left to surgeons only. With new technologies non-surgical less invasive interventional procedures have been introduced. Alternatively, in addition to formal surgery open abdomen techniques have long been proposed as aiding source control in severe intra-abdominal sepsis. It is ironic that while a lack or even delay regarding source control clearly associates with death, it is a concept that remains poorly described. For example, no conclusive definition of source control technique or even adequacy has been universally accepted. Practically, source control involves a complex definition encompassing several factors including the causative event, source of infection bacteria, local bacterial flora, patient condition, and his/her eventual comorbidities. With greater understanding of the systemic pathobiology of sepsis and the profound implications of the human microbiome, adequate source control is no longer only a surgical issue but one that requires a multidisciplinary, multimodality approach. Thus, while any breach in the GI tract must be controlled, source control should also attempt to control the generation and propagation of the systemic biomediators and dysbiotic influences on the microbiome that perpetuate multi-system organ failure and death. Given these increased complexities, the present paper represents the current opinions and recommendations for future research of the World Society of Emergency Surgery, of the Global Alliance for Infections in Surgery of Surgical Infection Society Europe and Surgical Infection Society America regarding the concepts and operational adequacy of source control in intra-abdominal infections."

    "abstract": "Many emergency general surgery (EGS) conditions can be managed both operatively or nonoperatively; however, it is unknown whether the decision to operate affects Black and White patients differentially. We identified a nationwide cohort of Black and White Medicare beneficiaries, hospitalized for common EGS conditions from July 2015 to June 2018. Using near-far matching to adjust for measurable confounding and an instrumental variable analysis to control for selection bias associated with treatment assignment, we compare outcomes of operative and nonoperative management in a stratified population of Black and White patients. Outcomes included in-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, nonroutine discharge, and 30-day readmissions. An interaction test based on a t test was used to determine the conditional effects of operative versus nonoperative management between Black and White patients. A total of 556,087 patients met inclusion criteria, of which 59,519 (10.7%) were Black and 496,568 (89.3%) were White. Overall, 165,932 (29.8%) patients had an operation and 390,155 (70.2%) were managed nonoperatively. Significant outcome differences were seen between operative and nonoperative management for some conditions; however, no significant differences were seen for the conditional effect of race on outcomes. The decision to manage an EGS patient operatively versus nonoperatively has varying effects on surgical outcomes. These effects vary by EGS condition. There were no significant conditional effects of race on the outcomes of operative versus nonoperative management among universally insured older adults hospitalized with EGS conditions."

    "abstract": "Running an emergency general surgery (EGS) service is challenging and requires significant personnel and institutional resources. The aim of this study was to achieve a nationwide overview of the individual EGS service organizations in public hospitals in Switzerland. All Swiss public hospitals with a surgical and emergency department were included and contacted by telephone. General surgeons were interviewed between December 2021 and January 2022 using a standardized questionnaire. Seventy-two out of 79 public hospitals in Switzerland (91.1%) agreed to the survey. They employed 1,581 surgeons in 19 (26.4%) hospitals with < 100 beds, 39 (54.2%) hospitals with 100-300 beds, 7 (9.7%) with 300-600 beds, and 7 (9.7%) with > 600 beds. The median number of surgeons per hospital was 20.5 (IQR 13.0-29.0). Higher level of care (intermediate or intensive care unit) was significantly less available in small hospitals (< 100 beds). The median hour of designated emergency operating room capacity per day was 14 h (IQR 14-24) for all hospitals with < 600 beds and 24 h (IQR 14-24) for the largest hospitals (> 600 beds). With increasing hospital size, there was a significant increase in the number of surgical units where EGS and orthopedic trauma surgery were covered by two separate teams (21.1% vs. 43.6% vs. 85.7% vs. 100%, p = 0.035). The median number of surgeons on-call per hospital and per 24 h was 5.0 (IQR 3.3-6.0). Lack of higher level of care in small hospitals, limited emergency OR capacity and short rotations of on-call teams are major drawbacks of many current EGS systems in Switzerland. Centralization of critically ill EGS patients and reorganization of surgical on-call systems to designated acute care surgery teams should be considered."

    "abstract": "Sixty-five million individuals in the US live in primary care shortage areas with nearly one-third of Medicare patients in need of a primary care health care professional. Periodic health examinations and preventive care visits have demonstrated a benefit for surgical patients; however, the impact of primary care health care professional shortages on adverse outcomes from surgery is largely unknown. To determine if preoperative primary care utilization is associated with postoperative mortality following an emergency general surgery (EGS) operation among Black and White older adults. This was a retrospective cohort study that took place at US hospitals with an emergency department. Participants were Medicare patients aged 66 years or older who were admitted from the emergency department for an EGS condition between July 1, 2015, and June 30, 2018, and underwent an operation on hospital day 0, 1, or 2. The analysis was performed during December 2022. Patients were classified into 1 of 5 EGS condition categories based on principal diagnosis codes; colorectal, general abdominal, hepatopancreatobiliary, intestinal obstruction, or upper gastrointestinal. Mixed-effects multivariable logistic regression was used in the risk-adjusted models. An interaction term model was used to measure effect modification by race. Primary care utilization in the year prior to presentation for an EGS operation. In-hospital, 30-day, 60-day, 90-day, and 180-day mortality. A total of 102 384 patients (mean age, 73.8 [SD, 11.5] years) were included in the study. Of those, 8559 were Black (8.4%) and 93 825 were White (91.6%). A total of 88 340 patients (86.3%) had seen a primary care physician in the year prior to their index hospitalization. After risk adjustment, patients with primary care exposure had 19% lower odds of in-hospital mortality than patients without primary care exposure (odds ratio [OR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72-0.92). At 30 days patients with primary care exposure had 27% lower odds of mortality (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.67-0.80). This remained relatively stable at 60 days (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.69-0.81), 90 days (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.69-0.81), and 180 days (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.70-0.81). None of the interactions between race and primary care physician exposure for mortality at any time interval were significantly different. In this observational study of Black and White Medicare patients, primary care utilization had no impact on in-hospital mortality for Black patients, but was associated with decreased mortality for White patients. Primary care utilization was associated with decreased mortality for both Black and White patients at 30, 60, 90 and 180 days."

The aim of the present study was to describe the perioperative outcomes and mortality of patients with COVID-19 who underwent emergency surgery. Retrospective study of COVID-19 patients symptomatic versus asymptomatic from March 2020 to February 2022 that needed an emergency surgery in a national referral hospital. Forty-four patients were included in this study. Patients with symptomatic COVID-19 have higher ICU admissions and prolonged length of stay (LOS) as compared with asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. The 90-day survival probability of the entire cohort was 70.1% (60.3-79.9) and was significantly lower in patients with COVID-19 symptomatic 63.4% (50.5-76.2).

    "abstract": "Multimorbidity is associated with an increased risk of poor surgical outcomes among older adults; however, identifying multimorbidity in the clinical setting can be a challenge. We created the Multimorbid Patient Identifier App (MMApp) to easily identify patients with multimorbidity identified by the presence of a Qualifying Comorbidity Set and tested its feasibility for use in future clinical research, validation, and eventually to guide clinical decision-making. We adapted the Qualifying Comorbidity Sets' claims-based definition of multimorbidity for clinical use through a modified Delphi approach and developed MMApp. A total of 10 residents input 5 hypothetical emergency general surgery patient scenarios, common among older adults, into the MMApp and examined MMApp test characteristics for a total of 50 trials. For MMApp, comorbidities selected for each scenario were recorded, along with the number of comorbidities correctly chosen, incorrectly chosen, and missed for each scenario. The sensitivity and specificity of identifying a patient as multimorbid using MMApp were calculated using composite data from all scenarios. To assess model feasibility, we compared the mean task completion by scenario to that of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Surgical Risk Calculator (ACS-NSQIP-SRC) using paired t tests. Usability and satisfaction with MMApp were assessed using an 18-item questionnaire administered immediately after completing all 5 scenarios. There was no significant difference in the task completion time between the MMApp and the ACS-NSQIP-SRC for scenarios A (86.3 seconds vs 74.3 seconds, P=.85) or C (58.4 seconds vs 68.9 seconds,P=.064), MMapp took less time for scenarios B (76.1 seconds vs 87.4 seconds, P=.03) and E (20.7 seconds vs 73 seconds, P<.001), and more time for scenario D (78.8 seconds vs 58.5 seconds, P=.02). The MMApp identified multimorbidity with 96.7% (29/30) sensitivity and 95% (19/20) specificity. User feedback was positive regarding MMApp's usability, efficiency, and usefulness. The MMApp identified multimorbidity with high sensitivity and specificity and did not require significantly more time to complete than a commonly used web-based risk-stratification tool for most scenarios. Mean user times were well under 2 minutes. Feedback was overall positive from residents regarding the usability and usefulness of this app, even in the emergency general surgery setting. It would be feasible to use MMApp to identify patients with multimorbidity in the emergency general surgery setting for validation, research, and eventual clinical use. This type of mobile app could serve as a template for other research teams to create a tool to easily screen participants for potential enrollment."

However, the true impact of obesity on postoperative outcomes is not well established and reports are conflicting. The aim was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the effect of obesity on perioperative outcomes for general surgery procedures in distinct obesity subtypes. A systematic review was performed for studies reporting postoperative outcomes in relation to BMI in upper gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary and colorectal based on an electronic search using the Cochrane Library, Science Direct, PubMed and Embase up to January 2022. The primary outcome was the incidence of 30-day postoperative mortality among patients with obesity undergoing general surgical procedures in comparison to patients with normal range BMI. Sixty-two studies, including 1 886 326 patients, were eligible for inclusion. Overall, patients with obesity (including class I/II/II) had lower 30-day mortality rates in comparison to patients with a normal BMI (odds ratio (OR) 0.75, 95 per cent c.i. 0.66 to 0.86, P < 0.0001, I2 = 71 per cent); this was also observed specifically in emergency general surgery (OR 0.83, 95 per cent c.i. 0.79 to 0.87, P < 0.0000001, I2 = 7 per cent). Compared with normal BMI, obesity was positively associated with an increased risk of 30-day postoperative morbidity (OR 1.11, 95 per cent c.i. 1.04 to 1.19, P = 0.002, I2 = 85 per cent). However, there was no significant difference in postoperative morbidity rates between the cohorts of patients with a normal BMI and class I/II obesity (OR 0.98, 95 per cent c.i. 0.92 to 1.04, P = 0.542, I2 = 92 per cent). Overall, the cohort with obesity had a higher rate of postoperative wound infections compared with the non-obese group (OR 1.40, 95 per cent c.i. 1.24 to 1.59, P < 0.0001, I2 = 82 per cent). These data suggest a possible 'obesity paradox' and challenge the assumption that patients with obesity have higher postoperative mortality compared with patients with normal range BMI. Increased BMI alone is not associated with increased perioperative mortality in general surgery, highlighting the importance of more accurate body composition assessment, such as computed tomography anthropometrics, to support perioperative risk stratification and decision-making.

This study implemented a pilot preoperative fasting reduction program for patients booked for acute surgery in the Department of General Surgery at a busy metropolitan tertiary hospital, including use of an electronic health record (EHR)-based solution, aiming to measure effect on fasting times and use of intravenous fluid (IVF). A pilot program was implemented in August 2021 in the Emergency General Surgery (EGS) unit at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, Australia. This included a new smart phrase within the EHR (EU2WU6: Eat until 2, drink water until 6) and an education campaign. Adult patients who underwent preoperative fasting between September 1 and December 31, 2021, were screened. Uptake of the protocol was recorded. Further, total fasting times (TFT) and IVF use were recorded. Potential impact with varying levels of protocol uptake was modeled. Uptake of EU2WU6 increased from 0% to 80%. TFT and total time on IVF (TT-IVF) were lower using EU2WU6 (TFT 7 hours vs. 13 hours, p < 0.001; TT-IVF 3 hours vs. 8 hours, p < 0.001). Proportion of patients requiring fluid overnight when using EU2WU6 was lower (18/45 vs. 34/50, p = 0.0062). Hospitalwide yearly savings, with 100% application of EU2WU6, were projected at 2,050 bags of IVF (at a cost savings of A$2,296), 10,251 minutes for physicians, and 20,502 minutes for nurses.

This scoping review aims to identify and summarize the literature on triage, timing, and mode of interfacility emergency general surgery transfer. While common, EGS transfer systems are not optimized to improve outcomes or ensure value-based care. We identified studies investigating emergency general surgery interfacility transfer using Ovid Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library between 1990 and 2022. English studies that evaluated EGS interfacility timing, triage or transfer mode were included. Studies were assessed by two independent reviewers. Studies were limited to English-language articles in the United States. Data were extracted and summarized with a narrative synthesis of the results and gaps in the literature. There were 423 articles identified, of which 66 underwent full-text review after meeting inclusion criteria. Most publications were descriptive studies or outcomes investigations of interfacility transfer. Only six articles described issues related to the logistics behind the interfacility transfer and were included. The articles were grouped into the predefined themes of transfer timing, triage, and mode of transfer. There were mixed results for the impact of transfer timing on outcomes with heterogeneous definitions of delay and populations. Triage guidelines for EGS transfer were consensus or expert opinion. No studies were identified addressing the mode of interfacility EGS transfer. Further research should focus on better understanding which populations of patients require expedited transfer and by what mode. The lack of high-level data supports the need for robust investigations into interfacility transfer processes to optimize triage using scarce resources and optimized value-based care."

Patient outcomes and process safety have not been evaluated. This study investigates the safety of FSED virtual triage in the emergency general surgery (EGS) patient population. A retrospective review evaluated all adult EGS patients admitted to a community hospital between January 2016 and December 2021 who either presented at a FSED and received virtual evaluation from a surgical team (fEGS) or presented at the community hospital emergency department and received in-person evaluation from the same surgical group (cEGS). Patients' demographics, acute care utilization history, and clinical characteristics at the onset of the index visit were used to build a propensity score model and stabilized Inverse Probability of Treatment Weights (IPTW) were used to create a weighted sample. Multivariable regression models were then employed to the weighted sample to evaluate the treatment effect of virtual triage compared to in-person evaluation on short-term outcomes, including length of stay (LOS) and 30-day readmission and mortality. Variables which occurred during the index visit (such as surgery duration and type of surgery) were adjusted for in the multivariable analyses. Of 1962 patients, 631 (32.2%) were initially evaluated virtually (fEGS) and 1331 (67.8%) underwent an in-person evaluation (cEGS). Baseline characteristics demonstrated significant differences between the cohorts in gender, race, payer status, BMI, and CCI score. Baseline risks were well balanced in the IPTW-weighted sample (SD range 0.002-0.18). Multivariable analysis found no significant differences between the balanced cohorts in 30-day readmission, 30-day mortality, and LOS (p > 0.05 for all). Patients who undergo virtual triage have similar outcomes to those who undergo in-person triage for EGS diagnoses. Virtual triage at FSED for these EGS patients may be an efficient and safe means for initial evaluation."

Included articles focused on patient populations related to trauma, surgical critical care, and emergency general surgery. Of the 4,178 articles reviewed, 74 met the inclusion criteria. Health care disparities related to gender (n = 10), race/ethnicity (n = 12), age (n = 14), income status (n = 6), health literacy (n = 6), location and access to care (n = 23), and insurance status (n = 13) were described. Studies published on disparities peaked in 2016 and 2022 with 13 and 15 studies respectively but dropped to one study in 2017. Studies demonstrated a significant increase in mortality for patients in rural geographical regions and in patients without health insurance and a decrease in patients who were treated at a trauma center. Gender disparities resulted in variable mortality rates and studied factors, including traumatic brain injury mortality and severity, venous thromboembolism, ventilator-associated pneumonia, firearm homicide, and intimate partner violence. Under-represented race/ethnicity was associated with variable mortality rates, with one study demonstrating increased mortality risk and three finding no association between race/ethnicity and mortality. Disparities in health literacy resulted in decreased discharge compliance and worse long-term functional outcomes. Studies on disparities in JTACS over the last decade primarily focused on location and access to health care, age, insurance status, and race, with a specific emphasis on mortality. This review highlights the areas in need of further research and funding in the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery regarding health care disparities in trauma aimed at interventions to reduce disparities in patient care, ensure equitable care, and inform future approaches targeting health care disparities.

    "title": "Delayed Bilateral Vocal Cord Paralysis Following Cervical Spine Trauma.",
    "abstract": "Bilateral vocal cord paralysis is a potentially life-threatening condition, depending on the position in which the vocal cords are paralyzed. When the vocal cords are fixed in adduction, patients develop respiratory distress, inspiratory stridor, aspiration, and minimal phonation deficits. This condition can result from acute injuries to the right and left recurrent laryngeal nerves, or from chronic bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. The clinical presentation is variable with such nerve injuries. Traumatic injuries to the cervical spine are an uncommon cause of this condition. In this report, we describe a patient who developed progressive respiratory distress, inspiratory stridor, and dysphagia to liquids several weeks after suffering major trauma to the head and neck. Laryngoscopy revealed immobile bilateral vocal cords fixed in the paramedian position, resulting in severe airway obstruction that warranted an emergency tracheostomy."

    "abstract": "Surgical intensive care unit (SICU) optimization is a critical factor impacting patient outcomes and resource utilization. SICUs operate using an open or closed model, where the surgeon or intensivist, respectively, manages critically-ill patients. In 2017, we adopted a closed-collaborative model. This study aimed to compare patient outcomes in the closed-collaborative model vs. the previous open model in a cohort of emergency general surgery (EGS) patients. A retrospective review of EGS SICU patients from August 2015 to July 2019 was performed. Patients were divided into \"Open\" and \"Closed\" cohorts before or after closed-collaborative model implementation on August 1, 2017. Demographic variables and clinical outcomes were analyzed. We identified 434 patients (O:191; C:243). While no significant demographic differences were observed, there was a higher proportion of patients with qSOFA scores greater than 2 in the closed cohort. There were no differences regarding sepsis, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, anemia, SICU length of stay (LOS), SICU costs, ventilation requirements, or ventilator duration; mortality rate was higher, but hospital LOS was shorter in the closed cohort. Overall, outcomes were not statistically different between the two models, despite sicker patients in the closed group, which we suspect accounts for the higher mortality in this group. We expect the decreased hospital LOS observed in the closed cohort improved bed management, patient flow, and ultimately led to institutional cost savings. Further investigation is warranted to examine SICU modeling effects in other surgical specialties and to evaluate potential hospital-level administrative benefits."

    "abstract": "In 2015, the United States moved from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision ( ICD-9 ), to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision ( ICD-10 ), coding system. The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Committee on Severity Assessment and Patient Outcomes previously established a list of ICD-9 diagnoses to define the field of emergency general surgery (EGS). This study evaluates the general equivalence mapping (GEM) crosswalk to generate an equivalent list of ICD-10 -coded EGS diagnoses. The GEM was used to generate a list of ICD-10 codes corresponding to the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma ICD-9 EGS diagnosis codes. These individual ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes were aggregated by surgical area and diagnosis groups. The volume of patients admitted with these diagnoses in the National Inpatient Sample in the ICD-9 era (2013-2014) was compared with the ICD-10 volumes to generate observed to expected ratios. The crosswalk was manually reviewed to identify the causes of discrepancies between the ICD-9 and ICD-10 lists. There were 485 ICD-9 codes, across 89 diagnosis categories and 11 surgical areas, which mapped to 1,206 unique ICD-10 codes. A total of 196 (40%) ICD-9 codes have an exact one-to-one match with an ICD-10 code. The median observed to expected ratio among the diagnosis groups for a primary diagnosis was 0.98 (interquartile range, 0.82-1.12). There were five key issues identified with the ability of the GEM to crosswalk ICD-9 EGS diagnoses to ICD-10 : (1) changes in admission volumes, (2) loss of necessary modifiers, (3) lack of specific ICD-10 code, (4) mapping to a different condition, and (5) change in coding nomenclature. The GEM provides a reasonable crosswalk for researchers and others to use when attempting to identify EGS patients in with ICD-10 diagnosis codes. However, we identify key issues and deficiencies, which must be accounted for to create an accurate patient cohort. This is essential for ensuring the validity of policy, quality improvement, and clinical research work anchored in ICD-10 coded data. Diagnostic Test/Criteria; Level III."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) admissions account for a large proportion of surgical care and represent the majority of surgical patients who suffer in-hospital mortality. Health care systems continue to experience growing demand for emergency services: one way in which this is being increasingly addressed is dedicated subspecialty teams for emergency surgical admissions, most commonly termed \"emergency general surgery\" in the United Kingdom. This study aims to understand the impact of the emergency general surgery model of care on outcomes from emergency laparotomies. Data was obtained from the National Emergency Laparotomy Audit database. Patients were dichotomized into EGS hospital or non-EGS hospital. Emergency general surgery hospital is defined as a hospital where >50% of in-hours emergency laparotomy operating is performed by an emergency general surgeon. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were intensive therapy unit (ITU) length of stay and duration of hospital stay. A propensity score weighting approach was used to reduce confounding and selection bias. There were 115,509 patients from 175 hospitals included in the final analysis. The EGS hospital care group included 5,789 patients versus 109,720 patients in the non-EGS group. Following propensity score weighting, mean standardized mean difference reduced from 0.055 to <0.001. In-hospital mortality was similar (10.8% vs. 11.1%, p = 0.094), with mean length of stay (16.7 days vs. 16.1 days, p < 0.001) and ITU stay (2.8 days vs. 2.6 days, p < 0.001) persistently longer in patients treated in EGS systems. No significant association between the emergency surgery hospital model of care and in-hospital mortality in emergency laparotomy patients was seen. There is a significant association between the emergency surgery hospital model of care and an increased length of ITU stay and overall hospital stay. Further studies are required to examine the impact of changing models of EGS delivery in the United Kingdom. Prognostic and Epidemiological; Level III."

    "abstract": "Background The use of Emergency Department Observation Units (EDOUs) to treat patients with a variety of complaints has grown over recent years. However, the treatment of patients with traumatic injuries in EDOUs is infrequently described. Our study sought to describe the feasibility of treating patients with blunt thoracic trauma in an EDOU in consultation with our trauma and acute care surgery (TACS) team. Together, our Emergency Department (ED) and TACS teams designed a protocol for the treatment of patients with specific blunt thoracic injuries (fewer than three rib fractures, nondisplaced sternal fractures) that we felt would require less than 24 hours of care in a hospital setting. Methods This study is an IRB-approved retrospective analysis comparing two groups before (pre-EDOU) and after (EDOU) the creation of the EDOU protocol, which was implemented in August 2020. Data was collected at a single, Level 1 trauma center with approximately 95,000 annual visits. Similar inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to select patients in both groups. We conducted two-sample t-tests and Chi-square testing to assess for significance. Primary outcomes include length of stay and bounce-back rate. Results A total of 81 patients were included in our data set across both groups. Forty-three patients were included in our pre-EDOU group while 38 patients were treated in our EDOU once the protocol was implemented. Patients in both groups were of similar age, gender and had similar Injury Severity Scores (ISS) ranging from 9 to 14. Hospital length of stay was shorter for the EDOU group (31.5 hours) compared to the pre-EDOU group (36.4 hours) although not statistically significant. When risk stratified by ISS, hospital length of stay did reach statistical significance and was found to be shorter for patients with ISS scores greater than or equal to 9 that were treated in the EDOU (29.1 hours vs. 43.8 hours, p = .028). Both groups had one patient each bounce back for repeat evaluation and additional care. Conclusion This study demonstrates the potential use of EDOUs to treat patients with mild to moderate blunt thoracic injuries. The availability of trauma surgeons for consultation along with ED provider experience may be rate-limiting steps in utilizing observation units to care for trauma patients. Additional research with more participants is needed to determine the impact of implementing such a practice at other institutions."

    "abstract": "The neck is a critical region containing many essential structures. Before surgical intervention, it is crucial to assess the adequacy of the airway and circulation, as well as the presence of any skeletal or neurological damage. Here, we present a case of a 33-year-old male with a background of amphetamine abuse who presented to our emergency department with a penetrating neck injury just below the mandible at the hypopharynx level, resulting in an upper zone II neck injury with complete separation of the airway. The patient was taken immediately to the operating room for exploration. Airways were managed by direct intubation, hemostasis was maintained, and the open laryngeal injury was repaired. After the surgery, this patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for two days and discharged after a satisfactory full recovery. Penetrating neck injuries are rare but often fatal. Advanced trauma life support guidelines emphasize the importance of managing the airway as the first action. Providing multidisciplinary care before, during, and after trauma can help prevent and treat such incidents."

    "abstract": "Older individuals increasingly require emergency abdominal surgeries. They are susceptible to surgical stress and loss of independence in performing daily activities. We hypothesized that the psoas muscle volume would be significantly associated with postoperative functional decline (FD) in older patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery and aimed to evaluate the use of the psoas muscle volume on computed tomography (CT) scans. A retrospective, single-center study of patients aged ≥ 65 years who had undergone emergency abdominal surgery between January 2019 and June 2021 was performed. We assessed patients' activities of daily living using the Barthel Index. FD was defined as a ≥ 5-point decrease between preoperative and 28-day postoperative values. The psoas muscle volume was measured by CT, which was used for diagnosis, and normalized by height to calculate total psoas muscle index (TPI). We evaluated associations between FD and TPI using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis. Of 238 eligible patients, 71 (29.8%) had clinical postoperative FD. Compared to the non-FD group, the FD group was significantly older and had a higher proportion of females, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, lower body mass index, higher American Society of Anesthesiology score, lower serum albumin level, and lower TPI. ROC analyses revealed that TPI had the highest area under the curve (0.802; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-0.86). A multivariable logistic regression model revealed that low TPI was an independent predictor of postoperative FD (odds ratio, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.06-0.32). TPI can predict postoperative FD due to emergency abdominal surgery. Identification of patients who are at high risk of FD before surgery may be useful for enhancing the regionalized system of care for emergency general surgery."

Issues impacting EGS mirror the same issues trauma surgery faced prior to the implementation of current trauma guidelines. This study analyzed the cost, time, and transport resource utilization of EGS patients with acute appendicitis when transferred from network hospitals to a level II trauma center. This was a retrospective study. Patients were transferred by a critical or specialty care transport team 62% of the time, although no skills performed required a critical or specialty care provider. The median time from decision to transfer to incision was 254 minutes, with an average transport time of 27 minutes. This study suggests that there is an opportunity to improve access to the operating room and to decrease resource utilization of specialty care and critical care transport for patients."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is the most common indication for emergency general surgery in the pediatric population. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used for diagnosis when ultrasound findings are equivocal. However, CT involves unnecessary radiation exposure if MRI is available. After introducing a rapid sequence MRI (rsMRI) appendicitis protocol at our institution, CT was still preferentially used. We therefore implemented a quality improvement (QI) campaign to reduce the rate of CTs and increase the rate of rsMRI. Here, we assess the effectiveness of the QI campaign while evaluating potential barriers to using rsMRI. We conducted a mixed methods study, first performing stakeholder interviews which informed the design of a QI campaign initiated in May 2021 and a midway feedback survey in December 2021. A retrospective cohort study was then performed of children evaluated for appendicitis at our institution between January 1, 2016, and April 30, 2022. CT and rsMRI rates were compared before and after QI campaign implementation. There was a significant decrease in rate of CTs and increase in rate of rsMRIs performed following the initiation of the QI campaign (p < 0.0001). The rate of CT scans decreased by a factor of 0.4 while the rate of rsMRI increased by a factor of 9.5. A successful QI campaign was initiated at our institution, resulting in decreased utilization of CT and increased use of rsMRI for the evaluation of suspected appendicitis. These results highlight the potential impact of QI projects. III."

    "abstract": "While direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use is increasing in the Emergency General Surgery (EGS) patient population, our understanding of their bleeding risk in the acute setting remains limited. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of perioperative bleeding complications in patients using DOACs versus warfarin and AP therapy requiring urgent/emergent EGS procedures (EGSPs). This was a prospective observational trial, conducted between 2019 and 2022, across 21 centers. Inclusion criteria were 18 years or older, DOAC, warfarin/AP use within 24 hours of requiring an urgent/emergent EGSP. Demographics, preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data were collected. ANOVA, χ 2 , and multivariable regression models were used to conduct the analysis. Of the 413 patients enrolled in the study, 261 (63%) reported warfarin/AP use and 152 (37%) reported DOAC use. Appendicitis and cholecystitis were the most frequent indication for operative intervention in the warfarin/AP group (43.4% vs. 25%, p = 0.001). Small bowel obstruction/abdominal wall hernias were the main indication for operative intervention in the DOAC group (44.7% vs. 23.8%, p = 0.001). Intraoperative, postoperative, and perioperative bleeding complications and in-hospital mortality were similar between the two groups. After adjusting for confounders, a history of chemotherapy (odds ratio [OR], 4.3; p = 0.015) and indication for operative intervention including occlusive mesenteric ischemia (OR, 4.27; p = 0.016), nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (OR, 3.13; p = 0.001), and diverticulitis (OR, 3.72; p = 0.019) were associated with increased perioperative bleeding complications. The need for an intraoperative transfusion (OR, 4.87; p < 0.001), and intraoperative vasopressors (OR, 4.35; p = 0.003) were associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Perioperative bleeding complications and mortality are impacted by the indication for EGSPs and patient's severity of illness rather than a history of DOAC or warfarin/AP use. Therefore, perioperative management should be guided by patient physiology and indication for surgery rather than the concern for recent antiplatelet or anticoagulant use.

We sought to understand the recovery experience of older patients at least 1 year after EGS to identify key factors for a successful long-term recovery. We conducted semi-structured interviews to explore recovery experiences of patients and their caregivers after admission for an EGS procedure. We screened patients who were aged 65 years or older at the time of an EGS operation, admitted at least 7 days, and still alive and able to consent at least 1 year postoperatively. We interviewed the patients, their primary caregiver, or both. Interview guides were developed to explore medical decision making, patient goals and expectations surrounding recovery after EGS, and to identify barriers and facilitators of recovery. Interviews were recorded and transcribed, and we used an inductive thematic approach to analysis. We performed 15 interviews (11 patients and 4 caregivers). Patients wanted to return to their prior quality of life, or 'get back to normal.' Family was key in providing both instrumental support (eg, for daily tasks such as cooking, driving, wound care) and emotional support. Provision of temporary support was key to the recovery of many patients. Although most patients returned to their prior lifestyle, some also experienced depression, persistent abdominal effects, pain, or decreased stamina. When asked about medical decision making, patients expressed viewing the decision for having an operation not as a choice but, rather, the only rational option to treat a severe symptom or life-threating illness. There is an opportunity in healthcare to provide better education for older patients and their caregivers around instrumental and emotional support to bolster successful recovery after emergency surgery.

The aim of this study was to find out the trends and results of emergency general surgery for elderly patients over 9 years in an emergency medical center in South Korea, where the population is aging most rapidly. The clinical characteristics, outcomes, and medical expenses of emergency general surgery for the elderly (aged 65-79 years) and highly elderly (aged ≥80 years) patients who visited to a regional emergency medical center from 2012 to 2020 were analyzed. The number of highly elderly patients increased with each 3-year interval, whereas the proportion of patients aged 19-79 years was similar, and that of pediatric patients was decreasing. The higher the age group, the higher the mortality (young adult vs. elderly vs. highly elderly: odds ratio [OR], 1 vs. 3.689 vs. 11.293; P < 0.001) and complication rates (OR, 1 vs. 2.840 vs. 4.633; P < 0.001), and longer length of hospital stay (β = 0.949, P = 0.001) even after adjusting for the type of surgery and the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification. Non-covered medical expenses were significantly related to the age groups (β = 151,608.802, P < 0.001).

No significant changes in level or trend for antimicrobial usage were detected for all and targeted antimicrobials. Similarly, no significant differences were detected for secondary outcomes. The survey response rate was 25% (n = 10). Moreover, 50% agreed that PAF provided them with skills to use antimicrobials more judiciously, and 80% agreed that PAF improved the quality of antimicrobial treatment for their patients.

Herein, we sought to: (1) compare POTTER to surgeons' surgical risk estimation and (2) assess how POTTER influences surgeons' risk estimation. A total of 150 patients who underwent EGS at a large quaternary care center between May 2018 and May 2019 were prospectively followed up for 30-day postoperative outcomes (mortality, septic shock, ventilator dependence, bleeding requiring transfusion, pneumonia), and clinical cases were systematically created representing their initial presentation. POTTER's outcome predictions for each case were also recorded. Thirty acute care surgeons with diverse practice settings and levels of experience were then randomized into two groups: 15 surgeons (SURG) were asked to predict the outcomes without access to POTTER's predictions while the remaining 15 (SURG-POTTER) were asked to predict the same outcomes after interacting with POTTER. Comparing to actual patient outcomes, the area under the curve (AUC) methodology was used to assess the predictive performance of (1) POTTER versus SURG, and (2) SURG versus SURG-POTTER. POTTER outperformed SURG in predicting all outcomes (mortality-AUC: 0.880 vs. 0.841; ventilator dependence-AUC: 0.928 vs. 0.833; bleeding-AUC: 0.832 vs. 0.735; pneumonia-AUC: 0.837 vs. 0.753) except septic shock (AUC: 0.816 vs. 0.820).

This study investigated the relationship between intraoperative procedures of emergency surgery for nonappendiceal perforation peritonitis and deep incisional or organ-space SSI. This prospective, two-center observational study included patients aged ≥ 20 years who underwent emergency surgery for perforation peritonitis between April 2017 and March 2020. We compared patients with deep incisional or organ-space SSI (Group S) to patients without SSIs or with superficial incisional SSIs (Group C). Thereafter, we evaluated the association between intraoperative technical variables and deep incisional or organ-space SSI using a multivariate logistic regression model. All multivariate analyses were adjusted for potentially relevant risk factors (e.g., age, body mass index, diabetes, smoking habit, and National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance risk index). Of the 75 participants, 14 were in Group S and 61 were in Group C. The use of a wound protector device was significantly associated with decreased odds of deep incisional or organ-space SSI (adjusted odds ratios [AOR], 0.017; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.0014-0.19, p = 0.0011). A 1000 ml increase in intra-abdominal lavage with normal saline was significantly associated with increased odds of deep incisional or organ-space SSI (AOR: 1.28, 95% CI 1.02-1.61, p = 0.033). Wound protector devices should be used in emergency surgery for nonappendiceal perforation peritonitis. Excessive intra-abdominal lavage with normal saline for peritonitis may have unsatisfactory benefits and increases the incidence of deep incisional or organ-space SSI."

A cholecystoenteric stent was attempted, but the stent dislodged during deployment. The fistula tract was clipped, and a percutaneous cholecystostomy drain was placed, which noted a leak at the gallbladder infundibulum. The patient deteriorated clinically and was taken emergently for an open cholecystectomy. Patient 3 was a 71-year-old male with history of ischemic cardiomyopathy who had a cholecystogastric stent placed for necrotizing gallstone pancreatitis. The stent migrated into the gastrointestinal tract and he developed post-prandial pain. A cholecystectomy and modified Graham patch repair of the gastrotomy was performed. This failed as the gastrotomy was too close to the pylorus. He underwent re-operation with Heineke-Mikulicz pyloroplasty. All patients recovered without any cardiopulmonary complications. With the increasing utility of cholecystoenteric stents, surgeons should be aware of the complications and have a plan for managing the duodenotomy or gastrotomy. Shared-medical decision-making involving surgeons should be applied when placing these stents."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) patients have an increased risk of mortality and morbidity compared to other surgical patients. Limited risk assessment tools exist for use in both operative and non-operative EGS patients. We assessed the accuracy of a modified Emergency Surgical Acuity Score (mESAS) in EGS patients at our institution. A retrospective cohort study from an acute surgical unit at a tertiary referral hospital was performed. Primary endpoints assessed included death before discharge, length of stay (LOS) >5 days and unplanned readmission within 28 days. Operative and non-operative patients were analysed separately. Validation was performed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), Brier score and Hosmer-Lemeshow test. A total of 1763 admissions between March 2018 and June 2021 were included for analysis. The mESAS was an accurate predictor of both death before discharge (AUROC 0.979, Brier score 0.007, Hosmer-Lemeshow P = 0.981) and LOS >5 days (0.787, 0.104, and 0.253, respectively). The mESAS was less accurate in predicting readmission within 28 days (0.639, 0.040, and 0.887, respectively). The mESAS retained its predictive ability for death before discharge and LOS >5 days in the split cohort analysis. This study is the first to validate a modified ESAS in a non-operatively managed EGS population internationally and the first to validate the mESAS in Australia. The mESAS accurately predicts death before discharge and prolonged LOS for all EGS patients, providing a highly useful tool for surgeons and EGS units worldwide."

However, discrepancy regarding optimal surgical management with 1 or 2 stage operation is still debated. This case report presents a 73-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department (ED) with a small bowel obstruction due to a gallstone lodged in a portion of the proximal ileum. The patient was also noted to have persistent cholelithiasis and cholecystoduodenal fistula. A single-stage surgery involving enterolithotomy, cholecystectomy, fistula repair, and cholangioscopy was performed. The patient progressed well and was discharged home without recurrent symptoms. Therefore, in a hemodynamically stable patient with persistent cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis, it is reasonable to perform a definitive single-stage operation."

    "abstract": "Social determinants of health (SDOH) including insurance and substance use affect 50-90% of health outcomes, yet there remains no standard means to quantify or predict their impact. We prospectively evaluated the effects of SDOH on length of stay (LOS) and readmissions among emergency general surgery (EGS) and trauma patients. We compared these outcomes with Medicare Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) data to better quantify the impact of SDOH. Adult (≥18 years old) EGS/trauma patients admitted July 7-28, 2020 at a Level 1 trauma center were prospectively enrolled. Primary outcomes were overall LOS, one-year readmissions, and excess LOS (eLOS), defined as days beyond DRG mean LOS. Assessment of SDOH among the 52 patients enrolled revealed that 5.8% of patients were homeless; 26.9% experienced substance abuse; 13.5% were uninsured on admission; and 7.7% on discharge. Mean LOS was 5 ± 4 days; 1-year readmission rate 25.0%; eLOS mean 1.75 ± 2.4 days. LOS was associated with substance use (OR 70.6 95% CI 11.7-160.4). eLOS was associated with substance use (OR 6.1, 95% CI 1.5-25.1) and public or no insurance (OR 26.0, 95% CI 4.9-138.1). No correlations were found between SDOH and readmission rates. EGS and trauma patients experience high rates of negative SDOH which affect clinical outcomes including LOS and readmissions. Medicare DRG determined eLOS is a fiscally relevant measure of the impact of SDOH and differs from LOS and readmissions. Further investigation is required to determine if eLOS can delineate the effects of other SDOH on admission outcomes for this patient population."

    "abstract": "Acute care surgeons perform more than 850,000 operations annually on emergency general surgery patients in the United States. Emergency general surgery conditions are associated with a disproportionate excess of patient complications and death. Innovative quality improvement strategies have focused on addressing the excess morbidity and mortality among this patient population. Minimally invasive surgical techniques have been shown to reduce the burden experienced by emergency general surgery patients. Still, limited adoption by acute care surgeons has restricted this application's potential. An institutional robotics acute care surgery program provides acute care surgeons additional opportunities to expand minimally invasive surgery access to emergency general surgery patients irrespective of the time or day of the week. A robotics acute care surgery program was developed and implemented at a high-volume academic institution within the division of trauma and acute care surgery. Three attending surgeons and two fellows within the trauma and acute care surgery division had successfully completed a defined robotics clinical pathway. As a result, around-the-clock use of a robotic surgical platform for emergency general surgery cases was implemented with routine use by trained robotic acute care surgeons and practicing fellows. The advancement of robotic surgical technology has opened new avenues for surgical application in the emergency setting. The development of a robotic acute care surgery program allows acute care surgeons to diversify their practice while providing greater access to minimally invasive approaches for emergency general surgery patients."

This study evaluated and compared the cognitive performance and technical skills of the two groups. This retrospective cohort study evaluated the performance of TL medical students to non-TL alumni from 2005 to 2017, using the students' academic performance coefficient, Clinical Competence Assessment, and Progress Test results. SigmaPlot 12.0 software was used to perform statistical analyses, including Mann-Whitney comparison tests and the Kruskal-Wallis test to confirm the data. Of the 1366 medical students who graduated from a Brazilian university, 966 were included, with 17.9% having participated in TL. Compared to non-TL participants, TL students demonstrated better cognitive performance according to the performance coefficient (p = 0.017) and Progress Test result (p < 0.001), and higher achievement in the Clinical Competence Assessment (p < 0.001). The academic performance of TL students was superior to that of non-TL students at the University of Campinas (Unicamp), suggesting a positive impact of TL in the preparation of future doctors. The study findings suggest that participation in TL at Unicamp was beneficial in preparing better doctors and should be considered by medical schools worldwide. II (Retrospective cohort)."

PLWHIV and PLWHCV face discrimination in many domains; it is unknown whether this extends to the receipt of EGS care. Using data from the 2016 to 2019 National Inpatient Sample, we examined 507,458 nonelective admissions of adults with indications for one of the 7 highest-burden EGS procedures (partial colectomy, small-bowel resection, cholecystectomy, operative management of peptic ulcer disease, lysis of peritoneal adhesions, appendectomy, or laparotomy). Using logistic regression, we evaluated the association between HIV/HCV status and the likelihood of undergoing one of these procedures, adjusting for demographic factors, comorbidities, and hospital characteristics. We also stratified analyses for the 7 procedures separately. After adjustment for covariates, PLWHIV had lower odds of undergoing an indicated EGS procedure [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 0.81; 95% CI: 0.73-0.89], as did PLWHCV (aOR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.63-0.70).

    "abstract": "Background: Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) are rapidly spreading, life-threatening infections that require emergent surgical intervention with immediate antibiotic initiation. However, there is no consensus regarding duration of antibiotic therapy after source control. We hypothesized that a short course of antibiotic therapy is as effective as a long course of antibiotic therapy after final debridement for NSTI. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library from inception to November 2022. Observational studies comparing short (≤7 days) versus long (>7 days) antibiotic duration for NSTI were included. Primary outcome was mortality and secondary outcomes included limb amputation and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Cumulative analysis was performed with Fisher exact test. Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed effects model and heterogeneity was assessed using Higgins I2. Results: A total of 622 titles were screened and four observational studies evaluating 532 patients met inclusion criteria. Mean age was 52 years, 67% were male, 61% had Fournier gangrene. There was no difference in mortality when comparing short to long duration antibiotic agents on both cumulative analysis (5.6% vs. 4.0%; p = 0.51) and meta-analysis (relative risk, 0.9; 95% confidence interval, 0.8-1.0; I2 0; p = 0.19). There was no significant difference in rates of limb amputation (11% vs. 8.5%; p = 0.50) or CDI (20.8% vs. 13.3%; p = 0.14). Conclusions: Short duration antibiotic therapy may be as effective as longer duration antibiotic therapy for NSTI after source control. Further high-quality data such as randomized clinical trials are required to create evidence-based guidelines."

    "abstract": "Unanticipated changes in health status and worsening of chronic conditions often prompt the need to consider emergency general surgery (EGS). Although discussions about goals of care may promote goal-concordant care and reduce patient and caregiver depression and anxiety, these conversations, as well as standardized documentation, remain infrequent for EGS patients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic health record data from patients admitted to an EGS service at a tertiary academic center to determine the prevalence of clinically meaningful advance care planning (ACP) documentation (conversations and legal ACP forms) during the EGS hospitalization. Multivariable regression was performed to identify patient, clinician, and procedural factors associated with the lack of ACP. Among 681 patients admitted to the EGS service in 2019, only 20.1% had ACP documentation in the electronic health record at any time point during their hospitalization (of those, 75.5% completed before and 24.5% completed during admission). Two thirds (65.8%) of the total cohort had surgery during their admission, but none of them had a documented ACP conversation with the surgical team preoperatively. Patients with ACP documentation tended to have Medicare insurance (adjusted odds ratio, 5.06; 95% confidence interval, 2.09-12.23; p < 0.001) and had greater burden of comorbid conditions (adjusted odds ratio, 4.19; 95% confidence interval, 2.55-6.88; p < 0.001). Adults experiencing a significant, often abrupt change in health status leading to an EGS admission are infrequently engaged in ACP conducted by the surgical team.

    "abstract": "To understand how multimorbidity impacts operative versus nonoperative management of emergency general surgery (EGS) conditions. EGS is a heterogenous field, encompassing operative and nonoperative treatment options. Decision-making is particularly complex for older patients with multimorbidity. Using an instrumental variable approach with near-far matching, this national, retrospective observational cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries examines the conditional effects of multimorbidity, defined using qualifying comorbidity sets, on operative versus nonoperative management of EGS conditions. Of 507,667 patients with EGS conditions, 155,493 (30.6%) received an operation. Overall, 278,836 (54.9%) were multimorbid. After adjustment, multimorbidity significantly increased the risk of in-hospital mortality associated with operative management for general abdominal patients (+9.8%; P = 0.002) and upper gastrointestinal patients (+19.9%, P < 0.001) and the risk of 30-day mortality (+27.7%, P < 0.001) and nonroutine discharge (+21.8%, P = 0.007) associated with operative management for upper gastrointestinal patients. Regardless of multimorbidity status, operative management was associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality among colorectal patients (multimorbid: + 12%, P < 0.001; nonmultimorbid: +4%, P = 0.003), higher risk of nonroutine discharge among colorectal (multimorbid: +42.3%, P < 0.001; nonmultimorbid: +55.1%, P < 0.001) and intestinal obstruction patients (multimorbid: +14.6%, P = 0.001; nonmultimorbid: +14.8%, P = 0.001), and lower risk of nonroutine discharge (multimorbid: -11.5%, P < 0.001; nonmultimorbid: -11.9%, P < 0.001) and 30-day readmissions (multimorbid: -8.2%, P = 0.002; nonmultimorbid: -9.7%, P < 0.001) among hepatobiliary patients. The effects of multimorbidity on operative versus nonoperative management varied by EGS condition category. Physicians and patients should have honest conversations about the expected risks and benefits of treatment options, and future investigations should aim to understand the optimal management of multimorbid EGS patients."

We hypothesized that burn surgeons would intubate burn patients at a lower rate than non-burn acute care surgeons (ACSs). We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients admitted to an American Burn Association-verified burn center who presented emergently following burn injury from June 2015 to December 2021. Patients excluded include polytrauma patients, isolated friction burns, and patients intubated prior to hospital arrival. Our primary outcome was intubation rates between burn and non-burn ACSs. 388 patients met inclusion criteria. 240 (62%) patients were evaluated by a burn provider and 148 (38%) were evaluated by a non-burn provider; the groups were well-matched. In total, 73 (19%) of patients underwent intubation. There was no difference in the rate of emergent intubation, diagnosis of inhalation injury on bronchoscopy, time to extubation, or incidence of extubation within 48 hours between burn and non-burn ACSs. We found no difference between burn and non-burn ACSs in the airway evaluation and management of burn patients. Surgical providers with acute care surgery backgrounds and Advanced Trauma Life Support training are well-equipped for initial airway management in burn patients. Further studies should seek to compare other types of provider groups to identify opportunities for intervention and education in preventing unnecessary intubations."

Backgrounds and various perioperative factors were compared retrospectively between the groups including patients who became bedridden from Performance Status Scale 0 to 3 before admission (Bedridden group) and those who did not (Keep group). Three cases of death and seven patients who were bedridden before admission were excluded. The 72 remaining patients were divided into the Bedridden group (n = 10, 13.9%) and the Keep group (n = 62, 86.1%).

Implementing a health equity framework within institutions such that local acute care surgeons can ensure equity is a component of quality is imperative. Recognizing this need, the AAST (American Association for the Surgery of Trauma) Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee convened an expert panel entitled 'Quality Care is Equitable Care' at the 81st annual meeting in September 2022 (Chicago, Illinois). Recommendations for introducing health equity metrics within health systems include: (1) capturing patient outcome data including patient experience data by race, ethnicity, language, sexual orientation, and gender identity; (2) ensuring cultural competency (eg, availability of language services; identifying sources of bias or inequities); (3) prioritizing health literacy; and (4) measuring disease-specific disparities such that targeted interventions are developed and implemented.

We performed a comprehensive review of the partnership between UAB, the United States Air Force Special Operations Command, and the Department of Defense (DoD) reviewing key documents and conducting interviews with providers. As a purely descriptive study, this project did not involve any patient data acquisition or analysis and therefore was exempt from institutional review board approval per institutional policy. At the time of this review, six core programs existed targeting training, clinical proficiency, and research. Training: (1) The Special Operations Center for Medical Integration and Development trains up to 144 combat medics yearly. (2) UAB trains one integrated military Surgery resident yearly with two additional civilian-sponsored military residents in Emergency Medicine. (3) UAB's Surgical Critical Care Fellowship had one National Guard member with two incoming Active-Duty, one Reservist and one prior service member in August 2022. Clinical Proficiency: (4) UAB hosts four permanently assigned United States Air Force Special Operations Command Special Operations Surgical Teams composed of general surgeons, anesthesiologists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, surgical technologists, emergency physicians, critical care registered nurses, and respiratory therapists totaling 24 permanently assigned active-duty health care professionals. (5) In addition, two fellowship-trained Air Force Trauma Critical Care Surgeons, one Active-Duty and one Reservist, are permanently assigned to UAB. These clinicians participate fully and independently in the routine care of patients alongside their civilian counterparts. Research: (6) UAB's Division of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery is currently conducting nine DoD-funded research projects totaling $6,482,790, and four research projects with military relevance funded by other agencies totaling $15,357,191.

    "abstract": "For patients who may permanently or temporarily lose their ability to communicate preferences, advance care planning is a critical mechanism to guide medical decision-making but is currently underused among surgical patients. A resident-led quality improvement project, including education and performance measurement, was conducted on an emergency general surgery service to increase the completion of inpatient advance care planning notes using a specialized template in the electronic health record. Advance care planning documentation was defined as either preadmission advance care planning documentation (eg, advance directive) or inpatient advance care planning (use of the electronic health record template). Data from patients admitted to the emergency general surgery service for 12+ hours were analyzed, and baseline data (July 2020 to June 2021) were compared with data from the intervention period (July 2021 to June 2022). The chart review evaluated the content of the inpatient advance care planning documentation from the intervention period. The frequency of inpatient advance care planning documentation increased (9.3%, n = 56 to 16.6%, n = 92, P < .001) with a greater contribution of inpatient advance care planning notes by the surgery team (16.7% to 55.4%) in the intervention period. Content analysis indicated that 79.0% of inpatient advance care planning notes listed preferences for life-sustaining therapy, 78.3% listed surrogacy, 57.3% listed overall health goals, and 50.3% listed treatment goals specific to the surgical encounter. Although a resident-led quality improvement project contributed to greater adoption of standardized inpatient advance care planning documentation on an emergency general surgery service, progress was slow, and integration into standard work was not achieved. Future efforts are needed to better understand the integration of essential advance care planning elements into workflows and to establish inclusive educational programming to prepare all team members for conducting and documenting advance care planning conversations."

The aim of our study was to evaluate whether the presence of a TAWH was associated with intra-abdominal injury requiring emergent laparotomy. The trauma registry was queried over an 8-year period (7/2012-7/2020) for adult patients with blunt thoracoabdominal trauma diagnosed with a TAWH. Those patients who were identified with a TAWH and greater than 15 years of age were included in the study. Demographics, mechanism of injury, ISS, BMI, length of stay, TAWH size, type of TAWH repair, and outcomes were analyzed. Overall, 38,749 trauma patients were admitted over the study period, of which 64 (.17%) had a TAWH. Patients were commonly male (n = 42, 65.6%); the median age was 39 years (range 16-79 years) and a mean ISS of 21. Twenty-eight percent had a clinical seatbelt sign. Twenty-seven (42.2%) went emergently to the operating room, the majority for perforated viscus requiring bowel resection (n = 16, 25.0%), and 6 patients (9.4%) who were initially managed nonoperatively underwent delayed laparotomy. Average ventilator days was 14 days, with a mean ICU LOS of 14 days and mean hospital LOS of 18 days. About half of the hernias were repaired at the index operation, 6 of which were repaired primarily and 10 with mesh. The presence of a TAWH alone was an indication for immediate laparotomy to evaluate for intra-abdominal injury. In the absence of other indications for exploration, nonoperative management may be safe."

Of an estimated 1,332,922 patients, 2.7% had dementia. Compared to those without, patients with dementia were older, more commonly male, and had a greater burden of chronic conditions. Following entropy balancing and multivariable risk-adjustment, dementia was associated with increased odds of mortality and sepsis across all operations except perforated ulcer repair. Dementia was also linked to greater likelihood of pneumonia across all operative categories. Moreover, dementia was associated with increased length of stay for patients in all operative categories except perforated ulcer repair, while costs were only increased for those undergoing appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and lysis of adhesions. Dementia was also linked to higher odds of non-home discharge following all operations, while non-elective readmissions were only increased for patients undergoing cholecystectomy. The present study found dementia to be associated with a significant clinical and financial burden. Our findings may help inform shared decision making with patients and their families."

    "abstract": "Due to immunosuppression and underlying comorbidities, transplant recipients represent a vulnerable population following emergency general surgery (EGS) operations. The present study sought to evaluate clinical and financial outcomes of transplant patients undergoing EGS. The 2010-2020 Nationwide Readmissions Database was queried for adults (≥18 years) with non-elective EGS. Operations included bowel resection, perforated ulcer repair, cholecystectomy, appendectomy and lysis of adhesions. Patients were classified by transplant history (Non-transplant, Kidney/Pancreas, Liver, Heart/Lung). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality while perioperative complications, resource utilization and readmissions were secondarily considered. Multivariable regression models evaluated the association of transplant status on outcomes. Entropy balancing was employed to obtain a weighted comparison to adjust for intergroup differences. Of 7,914,815 patients undergoing EGS, 25,278 (0.32 %) had prior transplantation. The incidence of transplant patients increased temporally (2010: 0.23 %, 2020: 0.36 %, p < 0.001) with Kidney/Pancreas comprising the largest proportion (63.5 %). Non-transplant more frequently underwent appendectomy and cholecystectomy while transplant patients more commonly received bowel resections. Following entropy balancing, Liver was associated with decreased odds of mortality (AOR: 0.67, 95 % CI: 0.54-0.83, Reference: Non-transplant). Incremental hospitalization duration was longer in Liver and Heart/Lung compared to Non-transplant. Odds of acute kidney injury, readmissions and costs were higher in all transplant types. The incidence of transplant recipients undergoing EGS operations has increased. Liver was observed to have lower mortality compared to Non-transplant. Transplant recipient status, regardless of organ, was associated with greater resource utilization and non-elective readmissions. Multidisciplinary care coordination is warranted to mitigate outcomes in this high-risk population."

The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma-European Society of Trauma and Emergency Surgery Emergency Surgery Course (AAST-ESTES ESC) course gives surgeons the knowledge and skills to make daily decisions about nontrauma emergency surgery. We held an AAST-ESTES ESC course in Japan from October 2 to 3, 2022. Thirty-two Japanese participants were asked to rate the following items using a 5-point Likert scale from 1 to 5: overall assessment, program subjects, content, instructional style, and activity. In addition, we also inquired about topics that participants intended to change as a result of what they had learned in the course. All items were rated highly (4.1-4.7) by the participants. Participants reported intending to implement changes concerning mesenteric ischemia, colorectal crises, and acute pancreatitis after taking the course. Japanese surgeons gave the AAST-ESTES ESC course excellent ratings, suggesting its crucial role in Japan, where there has been no development of nontrauma emergency surgery education courses."

    "abstract": "Gains in inpatient survival over the last five decades have shifted the burden of major injuries and surgical emergencies from the acute phase to their long-term sequelae. More attention has been placed on evaluation and optimization of long-term physical and mental health; however, the impact of major injuries and surgical emergencies on long-term financial well-being remains a critical blind spot for clinicians and researchers. The concept of financial toxicity encompasses both the objective financial consequences of illness and medical care as well as patients' subjective financial concerns. In this review, representatives of the Healthcare Economics Committee from the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (1) provide a conceptual overview of financial toxicity after trauma or emergency surgery, (2) outline what is known regarding long-term economic outcomes among trauma and emergency surgery patients, (3) explore the bidirectional relationship between financial toxicity and long-term physical and mental health outcomes, (4) highlight policies and programs that may mitigate financial toxicity, and (5) identify the current knowledge gaps and critical next steps for clinicians and researchers engaged in this work."

    "abstract": "Timely access to the operating room for emergency general surgery (EGS) indications remains a challenge across the globe, largely driven by operating room availability and staffing constraints. The \"timing in acute care surgery\" (TACS) classification was previously published to introduce a new tool to triage the timely and appropriate access of EGS patients to the operating room. However, the clinical and operational effectiveness of the TACS classification has not been investigated in subsequent validation studies. This study aimed to improve the TACS classification and provide further consensus around the appropriate use of the new TACS classification through a standardized Delphi approach with international experts. This is a validation study of the new TACS by a selected international panel of experts using the Delphi method. The TACS questionnaire was designed as a web-based survey. The consensus agreement level was established to be ≥ 75%. The collective consensus agreement was defined as the sum of the percentage of the highest Likert scale levels (4-5) out of all participants. Surgical emergency diseases and correlated clinical scenarios were defined for each of the proposed classes. Subsequent rounds were carried out until a definitive level of consensus was reached. Frequencies and percentages were calculated to determine the degree of agreement for each surgical disease. Four polling rounds were carried out. The new TACS classification provides 6 colour-code classes correlated to a precise timing to surgery, defined scenarios and surgical condition. The WHITE colour-code class was introduced to rapidly (within a week) reschedule cancelled or postponed surgical procedures. Haemodynamic stability is the main tool to stratify patients for immediate surgery or not in the presence of sepsis/septic shock. Fifty-one surgical diseases were included in the different colour-code classes of priority. The new TACS classification is a comprehensive, simple, clear and reproducible triage system which can be used to assess the severity of the patient and the surgical disease, to reduce the time to access to the operating room, and to manage the emergency surgical patients within a \"safe\" timeframe. By including well-defined surgical diseases in the different colour-code classes of priority, validated through a Delphi consensus, the new TACS improves communication among surgeons, between surgeons and anaesthesiologists and decreases conflicts and waste and waiting time in accessing the operating room for emergency surgical patients."

Distressed Community Index (DCI) was linked, which quantifies SES through unemployment, poverty, and other factors. Zipcodes are assigned DCI 0 (no distress) to 100 (severe distress). Linear regression with stepwise elimination was conducted. Top and bottom DCI quintiles were propensity matched for demographics, comorbidities, and procedure. 144,924 admissions were included. Linear regression eliminated 5 of 28 variables, including DCI. Top cost contributors were discharge-43%; comorbidities-14%; age-9%. Distressed patients received less home health and inpatient rehab. Distressed patients utilized 4-/5-star hospitals less and had higher odds of mortality. Discharge, mortality, and hospital characteristics differ significantly between DCI communities. Total cost was similar, and is strongly influenced by discharge status, while DCI had no effect."

    "abstract": "In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we examined the evidence on transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) as a bridge to elective and emergency surgery in cirrhotic patients. We aimed to assess the perioperative characteristics, management approaches, and outcomes of this intervention, which is used to achieve portal decompression and enable the safe performance of elective and emergent surgery. MEDLINE and Scopus were searched for studies reporting the outcomes of cirrhotic patients undergoing elective and emergency surgery with preoperative TIPS. The risk of bias was evaluated using the methodological index for non-randomized studies of interventions, and the JBI critical appraisal tool for case reports. The outcomes of interest were: 1. Surgery after TIPS; 2. Mortality; 3. Perioperative transfusions; and 4. Postoperative liver-related events. A DerSimonian and Laird (random-effects) model was used to perform the meta-analyses in which the overall (combined) effect estimate was presented in the form of an odds ratio (summary statistic). Of 426 patients (from 27 articles), 256 (60.1%) underwent preoperative TIPS. Random effects MA showed significantly lower odds of postoperative ascites with preoperative TIPS (OR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.22-0.72; I2 = 0%). There were no significant differences in 90-day mortality (3 studies: OR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.33-1.77; I2 = 18.2%), perioperative transfusion requirement (3 studies: OR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.28-2,84; I2 = 70.1%), postoperative hepatic encephalopathy (2 studies: OR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.35-2.69; I2 = 0%), and postoperative ACLF (3 studies: OR = 1.02, 95% CI 0.15-6.8, I2 = 78.9%). Preoperative TIPS appears safe in cirrhotic patients who undergo elective and emergency surgery and may have a potential role in postoperative ascites control. Future randomized clinical trials should test these preliminary results."

A contemporary analysis using propensity score matching that compares outcomes is lacking. Over a 6-month period, 38 centres (5% of all public hospitals) attending emergency general surgery patients on a 24 h, 7 days a week basis, enroled all consecutive adult patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery or open approach. The study included 2 645 patients with acute appendicitis [32 years (22-51), 44.3% women], 1 182 with acute cholecystitis [65 years (48-76); 46.7% women], and 470 with gastrointestinal tract perforation [65 years (50-76); 34% women].

A decrease in 30-day morbidity was observed in acute appendicitis (open, 15.7%; lap, 9.7%; P <0.001), acute cholecystitis (open, 41%; lap, 21.7%; P <0.001), and gastrointestinal tract perforation (open, 45.2%; lap, 23.5%; P <0.001). A decrease in 30-day mortality was found in acute cholecystitis (open, 8.8%; lap, 2.8%; P =0.013) and gastrointestinal tract perforation (open, 10.4%; lap, 1.7%; P =0.013). This clinically based, multicentre study suggests that an initial laparoscopic approach could be considered not only in patients with acute appendicitis or acute cholecystitis but also in patients with a perforation of the gastrointestinal tract."

To understand how preoperative processes of care may influence disparate outcomes, we examined rates of surgical consultation, treatment, and operative approach between older adults with and without serious mental illness (SMI). We performed a nationwide, retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65.5 years or more hospitalized via the emergency department for acute cholecystitis or biliary colic. SMI was defined as schizophrenia spectrum, mood, and/or anxiety disorders. The primary outcome was surgical consultation. Secondary outcomes included operative treatment and surgical approach (laparoscopic vs open). Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine outcomes with adjustment for potential confounders related to patient demographics, comorbidities, and rates of imaging. Of 85,943 included older adults, 19,549 (22.7%) had SMI. Before adjustment, patients with SMI had lower rates of surgical consultation (78.6% vs 80.2%, p < 0.001) and operative treatment (68.2% vs 71.7%, p < 0.001), but no significant difference regarding laparoscopic approach (92.0% vs 92.1%, p = 0.805). In multivariable regression models with adjustment for confounders, there was no difference in odds of receiving a surgical consultation (odds ratio 0.98 [95% CI 0.93 to 1.03]) or undergoing operative treatment (odds ratio 0.98 [95% CI 0.93 to 1.03]) for patients with SMI compared with those without SMI. Older adults with SMI had similar odds of receiving surgical consultation and operative treatment as those without SMI. As such, differences in processes of care that result in SMI-related disparities likely occur before or after the point of surgical consultation in this universally insured patient population."

Emerging literature supports anti-factor Xa (AFXa) monitoring for patients on enoxaparin (LMWH), although a significant knowledge gap remains regarding the optimal dosing and monitoring in EGS patients. We hypothesize that standard dose VTE prophylaxis regimens provide inadequate VTE prophylaxis in EGS patients. A prospective cohort study of all adult EGS patients at a single institution between August 2021 and February 2022 receiving standard dose LMWH for VTE prophylaxis was performed. AFXa levels were obtained 4 hours after the third dose of enoxaparin with a target range of 0.3 to 0.5 IU/mL. Adjustment to dosing and repeat AFXa measurement after the adjusted third dose was obtained. A total of 81 patients underwent AFXa monitoring, the majority (75%) of whom were started on 40 mg LMWH daily. Initial peak AFXa measurement was low in 87.7% of patients (mean 0.16 IU/mL). Of patients who had an initial low AFXa, remained admitted, and underwent dosing adjustment and AFXa reassessment (27%), the majority were adjusted to either 30 or 40 mg of LMWH twice daily (23.7% and 55%, respectively), with 82% of patients remaining low. There were no significant differences in demographics or BMI between those with low vs adequate AFXa levels at either initial or subsequent measurement. Standard LMWH dosing provides inadequate AFXa inhibition for adequate VTE prophylaxis. These findings highlight the importance of ongoing AFXa monitoring and the need to establish clinical protocols to improve VTE prophylaxis in EGS patients."

Guidelines on ERAS in emergency surgery have been recently published; however, few evidences are still available in the literature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of an enhanced recovery protocol in a large cohort of patients undergoing emergency surgery and to identify possible factors impacting postoperative protocol compliance. This is a prospective multicenter observational study including patients who underwent major emergency general surgery for either intra-abdominal infection or intestinal obstruction. The primary endpoint of the study is the adherence to ERAS postoperative protocol. Secondary endpoints are 30-day mortality and morbidity rates, and length of hospital stay. A total of 589 patients were enrolled in the study, 256 (43.5%) of them underwent intestinal resection with anastomosis. Major complications occurred in 92 (15.6%) patients and 30-day mortality was 6.3%. Median adherence occurred on postoperative day (POD) 1 for naso-gastric tube removal, on POD 2 for mobilization and urinary catheter removal, and on POD 3 for oral intake and i.v. fluid suspension. Laparoscopy was significantly associated with adherence to postoperative protocol, whereas operative fluid infusion > 12 mL/Kg/h, preoperative hyperglycemia, presence of a drain, duration of surgery and major complications showed a negative association. The present study supports that an enhanced recovery protocol in emergency surgery is feasible and safe. Laparoscopy was associated with an earlier recovery, whereas preoperative hyperglycemia, fluid overload, and abdominal drain were associated with a delayed recovery."

Accurate and timely diagnosis of EGS conditions is crucial for optimal management and patient outcomes. Individuals with intellectual disabilities may be at increased risk of delayed presentation and worse outcomes for EGS; however, little is known about surgical outcomes in this population. Using the 2012-2017 Nationwide Inpatient Sample, we conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of adult patients admitted for 9 common EGS conditions. We performed multivariable logistic and linear regression to examine the association between intellectual disability and the following outcomes: EGS disease severity at presentation, any surgery, complications, mortality, length of stay, discharge disposition, and inpatient costs. Analyses were adjusted for patient demographics and facility traits. Of 1,317,572 adult EGS admissions, 5,062 (0.38%) patients had a concurrent ICD-9/-10 code consistent with intellectual disability. EGS patients with intellectual disabilities had 31% higher odds of more severe disease at presentation compared with neurotypical patients (aOR 1.31; 95% CI 1.17-1.48). Intellectual disability was also associated with a higher rate of complications and mortality, longer lengths of stay, lower rate of discharge to home, and higher inpatient costs. EGS patients with intellectual disabilities are at increased risk of more severe presentation and worse outcomes. The underlying causes of delayed presentation and worse outcomes must be better characterized to address the disparities in surgical care for this often under-recognized but highly vulnerable population."

However, data about readmission or unexpected death after discharge from ICU in patients who have undergone emergency general surgery (EGS) is very limited. In total, 1133 patients who underwent EGS were identified in the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Of these 1133 patients, 124 underwent readmission into the ICU or death unexpectedly after their initial discharge. The clinical characteristics of the patients were investigated. A logistic regression model was implemented for the analysis of the independent risk factors associated with ICU readmission or unexpected death. A nomogram model was established to predict the risk of ICU readmission or unexpected death within 72 h after EGS. Peripheral vascular disease and atrial fibrillation, vasopressor requirement, a higher respiratory rate or heart rate, a lower pulse oxygen saturation or a platelet count of <150 K/μL and a relatively low Glasgow coma scale score in the last 24 h before ICU discharge were independent risk factors for ICU readmission or death within 72 h. The nomogram had moderate accuracy with an area under the curve of 0.852, which had a stronger prediction power than the Stability and Workload Index for Transfer (SWIFT) score, a classic prediction model for ICU readmission risk. In critically ill patients who undergo EGS, ICU readmission or unexpected death within 72 h can be predicted using a nomogram model based on eight parameters including physiological and laboratory test values in the last 24 h before discharge and comorbidities. ICU physicians should prudently assess patients to make effective discharge decisions."

Four 90-minute in-person STB trainings were conducted by medical personnel with community-based interpreters at a central and familiar location in the Clarkston community. Pre- and post-tests were administered in participant's preferred language to evaluate change in knowledge and beliefs as well as the effectiveness of the training method. A total of 46 community members were trained in STB, the majority of which were women (63%). Participants demonstrated improvement in their knowledge, confidence, and comfort using STB techniques. Participants reported that 2 aspects of the training were particularly beneficial: the presence of language concordant interpreters from the community and small group hands on sessions that allowed for practicing STB techniques. Cultural and linguistic adaptation of STB training is a feasible, cost-effective, and effective method for disseminating life-saving information and trauma education to immigrant populations who have LEP. Expansion of community training and partnerships to support the needs of diverse communities is both necessary and urgent."

A retrospective review was undertaken of hospital encounters in the Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission from 2014 to 2018 of OAs undergoing EGSPs. Older adults residing in the 50 most affluent (MANs) and 50 least affluent (LANs) neighborhoods based on zip codes were compared. Data collected included demographics, all patient-refined (APR)-severity of illness (SOI), APR-risk of mortality (ROM), Charlson Comorbidity Index, complications, mortality, and discharge to a higher level of care. Of the 8661 OAs analyzed, 2362 (27.3%) resided in MANs and 6299 (72.7%) in LANs. Older adults in LANs were more likely to undergo EGSPs, had higher APR-SOI and APR-ROM, and experienced more complications, discharge to higher level of care, and mortality. Living in LANs was independently associated with discharge to higher level of care (OR 1.56, 95% CI: 1.38-1.77, P < .001) and increased mortality (OR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.07-1.71, P = .01). Mortality and quality of life in OAs undergoing EGSPs are dependent on environmental factors likely determined by neighborhood location.

    "abstract": "Guidelines developed by the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) exist to reserve the use of head CT for pediatric patients with a high risk of head injury. However, CTs are still being overutilized especially at adult trauma centers. The aim of our study was to review our use of head CTs in adolescent blunt trauma patients. Patients aged 11-18 who underwent head CT scans from 2016 to 2019 at our urban level 1 adult trauma center were included. Data was collected via electronic medical record and analyzed through retrospective chart review. Of the 285 patients requiring a head CT, 205 had a negative head CT (NHCT) and 80 patients had a positive head CT (PHCT). There was no difference in age, gender, race, and trauma mechanism between the groups. The PHCT group was found to be with a statistically significant higher likelihood of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) < 15 (65% vs 23%; P < .01), abnormal head exam (70% vs 25%; P < .01), and loss of consciousness (85% vs 54%; P < .01) compared to the NHCT group. There were 44 patients who had low risk of head injury, based on the PECARN guidelines, and received a head CT. None of the patients had a positive head CT. Our study suggests that reinforcement of the PECARN guidelines should occur for ordering head CTs in adolescent blunt trauma patients. Future prospective studies are needed to validate the use of PECARN head CT guidelines in this patient population."

    "abstract": "Background: A 2021 report of the Aortic Occlusion for Resuscitation in Trauma and Acute Care Surgery multicenter registry described the outcomes of patients treated with Zone 3 resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA zone 3). Our study builds upon that report, testing the hypothesis that REBOA zone 3 is associated with better outcomes than REBOA Zone 1 in the immediate treatment of severe, blunt pelvic injuries. Methods: We included adults who underwent aortic occlusion (AO) via REBOA zone 1 or REBOA Zone 3 in the emergency department for severe, blunt pelvic injuries [Abbreviated Injury Score ≥ 3 or pelvic packing/embolization/first 24 hours] in institutions with >10 REBOAs. Adjustment for confounders was accomplished with a Cox proportional hazards model for survival, generalized estimating equations for intensive care unit (ICU)-free days (IFD) and ventilation-free days (VFD) > 0 days, and mixed linear models for continuous outcomes (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS], Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS]), accounting for facility clustering. Results: Of 109 eligible patients, 66 (60.6%) underwent REBOA Zone 3 and 43 (39.4%) REBOA Zone 1. There were no differences in demographics, but compared with REBOA Zone 3, REBOA Zone 1 patients were more likely to be admitted to high volume centers and be more severely injured. These patients did not differ in systolic blood pressure (SBP), cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the prehospital/hospital settings, SBP at the start of AO, time to AO start, likelihood of achieving hemodynamic stability or requirement of a second AO. After controlling for confounders, compared with REBOA Zone 3, REBOA Zone 1 was associated with a significantly higher mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-2.19), but there were no differences in VFD > 0 (adjusted relative risk, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.33-1.31), IFD > 0 (adjusted relative risk, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.39-1.57), discharge GCS (adjusted difference, -1.16; 95% CI, -4.2 to 1.90) or discharge GOS (adjusted difference, -0.67; 95% CI -1.9 to 0.63). Conclusions: This study suggests that compared with REBOA Zone 1, REBOA Zone 3 provides superior survival and is not inferior regarding other adverse outcomes in patients with severe blunt pelvic injuries."

    "abstract": "Pleural empyemas carry a high morbidity and mortality. Some can be managed with medical treatment but most require some form of surgery with the goals to remove the infected material from the pleural space and to help re-expand the collapsed lung. Keyhole surgery by Video Assisted Thoracoscopy Surgery (VATS) is rapidly becoming a common approach to deal with early stage empyemas to avoid larger, more painful thoracotomies that hinder recovery. However, the ability to achieve those aforementioned goals is often hindered by VATS surgery due to the instruments available. We have developed a simple instrument called the \"VATS Pleural Debrider\" to achieve those goals in empyema surgery that can be used in keyhole surgery. We have used this device in over 90 patients with no peri-operative mortality and a low re-operation rate. Used in routine urgent/emergency pleural empyema surgery across 2 cardiothoracic surgery centres."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstructions (SBOs) account for a significant burden on the health care system. Should the ongoing trend of regionalizing medicine extend to these patients? We investigated if there is a benefit to admitting SBOs to larger teaching hospitals and to surgical services. We performed a retrospective chart review of 505 patients admitted to a Sentara Facility between 2012 and 2019 with a diagnosis of SBO. Patients between the ages of 18 and 89 were included. Patients were excluded if they required emergent operation. Outcomes were evaluated based on patient's admission either to a teaching or community hospital as well as the admitting service's specialty. Of 505 patients admitted with a SBO, 351 (69.5%) were admitted to a teaching hospital. 392 (77.6%) patients were admitted to a surgical service. The average length of stay (LOS) (4 vs 7 days, P < .0001) and cost ($18,069.79 vs $26,458.20, P < .0001) were lower at teaching hospitals. The same trends in LOS (4 vs 7 days, P < .0001) and cost ($18,265.10 vs $29 944.82, P < .0001) were seen with surgical services. The 30-day readmission rate was higher in teaching hospitals (18.2% vs 11%, P = .0429), and no difference was seen in operative rate or mortality. These data would suggest that there is a benefit to admitting SBO patients to larger teaching hospitals and to surgical services with regard to LOS and cost, suggesting that these patients might benefit from treatment at centers with emergency general surgery (EGS) Services."

    "abstract": "Variation in surgical management exists nationally. We hypothesize that geographic variation exists in adhesive small bowel obstruction (aSBO) management. A retrospective analysis of a national commercial insurance claims database (MarketScan) sample (2017-2019) was performed in adults with hospital admission due to aSBO. Geographic variation in rates of surgical intervention for aSBO was evaluated by state and compared to a risk-adjusted national baseline using a Bayesian spatial rates Poisson regression model. For individual-level analysis, patients were identified in 2018, with 365-d look back and follow-up periods. Logistic regression was performed for individual-level predictors of operative intervention for aSBO. Two thousand one hundred forty-five patients were included. State-level analysis revealed rates of operative intervention for aSBO were significantly higher in Missouri and lower in Florida. On individual-level analysis, age (P < 0.01) and male sex (P < 0.03) but not comorbidity profile or prior aSBO, were negatively associated with undergoing operative management for aSBO. Patients presenting in 2018 with a history of admission for aSBO the year prior experienced a five-fold increase in odds of representation (odds ratio: 5.4, 95% confidence interval: 3.1-9.6) in 2019. Patients who received an operation for aSBO in 2018 reduced the odds of readmission in the next year by 77% (odds ratio: 0.23, 95% confidence interval: 0.1-0.5). The volume of operations performed within a state did not influence readmission. Surgical management of aSBO varies across the continental USA. Operative intervention is associated with decreased rates of representation in the following year. These data highlight a critical need for standardized guidelines for emergency general surgery patients."

    "abstract": "Emergency anterior abdominal wall hernia surgery plays a pivotal role in emergency general surgery practice. In this study, the predictive value of laboratory and imaging findings as well as demographic information and comorbidities of the patients for the recognition of strangulation and intestinal resection was investigated. Patients over the age of 18 who were operated consecutively with an indication for emergency anterior abdominal wall hernia surgery between January 2017 and December 2019 in a single tertiary hospital were included in this retrospective cohort study. The patient population was divided into two groups according to the pre-operative findings during the emergency anterior abdominal wall hernia surgery. Group 1 consisted of cases with incarceration but without strangulation, whereas Group 2 consisted of cases with strangulation in addition to incarceration. Moreover, in evaluation for the requirement for intestinal resection, patient Group 2 was divided further into two groups, namely, as Group (1 or 2) a and Group (1 or 2) b, defining the need for intestinal resection. A total of 106 patients who had emergency anterior abdominal wall repair surgery due to incarcerated hernias were included in the study. The evaluation of the indices related to systemic inflammation revealed that lactate dehydrogenase to white blood cell ratio was significantly lower but neutrophil to platelet and neutrophil to albumin ratios were significantly higher in patients with strangulation, showing the significance of those systemic inflammation indices in detecting strangulation (p=0.027, p=0.035 and p=0.030, respectively). Moreover, the analysis of the patients in whom intestinal resection was required (Group 2a vs. 2b) exposed that neutrophil to albumin ratio was significantly higher in the patients with intestinal resection (p=0.036). Indices of systemic inflammation such as lactate dehydrogenase to white blood cell ratio, neutrophil to platelet ratio, and particularly neutrophil to albumin ratio may be potentially beneficial to prevent complications and improve clinical outcomes in emergency hernia surgery."

    "abstract": "Acute care surgery (ACS) is an area of surgical specialization within general surgery and a model for clinical care delivery that has proliferated over the last 2 decades. Models of ACS in Canada exist in both academic and community settings and are used to manage patients in need of emergency general surgery (EGS) care, with or without the provision of trauma care. The implementation of the ACS model has changed the landscape of patient care, surgical education and the workforce, providing an option for some general surgeons to exclude EGS care from their regular practice. The rise of ACS as a concentration of surgical skill and content expertise has resulted in the establishment of dedicated ACS fellowship training programs. This is a landmark in the evolution of general surgery, as well as a stepping stone on the path to improving patient care, surgical education and scholarly endeavour in this field."

Interhospital transfers of patients are increasingly necessary, and care coordination across settings is critical to quality care. We characterize the role of repeated hospital patient sharing in outcomes of transfers for emergency general surgery (EGS) patients. A multicenter study of Wisconsin inpatient acute care hospital stays that involved transfer of EGS patients using data from the Wisconsin Hospital Association, a statewide hospital discharge census for 2016 to 2018. We hypothesized that higher proportion of patients transferred between hospitals would result in better outcomes. We examined the association between the proportion of EGS patients transferred between hospitals and patient outcomes, including in-hospital morbidity, mortality, and length of stay. Additional variables included hospital organizational characteristics and patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. One hundred eighteen hospitals transferred 3,197 emergency general surgery patients over the 2-year study period; 1,131 experienced in-hospital morbidity, mortality, or extended length of stay (>75th percentile). Patients were 62 years old on average, 50% were female, and 5% were non-White. In the mixed-effects model, hospitals' proportion of patients shared was associated with lower odds of an in-hospital complication; specifically, when the proportion of patients shared between two hospitals doubled, the relative odds of any outcome changed by 0.85. Our results suggest the importance of emergent relationships between hospital dyads that share patients in quality outcomes. Transfer protocols should account for established efficiencies, familiarity, and coordination between hospitals. Prognostic and Epidemiological; Level III."

We sought to characterize the EGS needs and impact of rurality for geriatric residents of New Hampshire. A retrospective cohort study of the New Hampshire Uniform Healthcare Facility Discharge Dataset, including patients 65 years and older with urgent/emergent admission who underwent 1 of 7 EGS procedures, grouped by urban or rural county of residence, discharged between 2012-2015. New Hampshire has 26 acute care hospitals: 10 (38.5%) are in urban counties and 16 (61.5%) are in rural counties. Thirteen (50.0%) are critical access hospitals (1 urban and 12 rural). Of 2,445 geriatric patient discharges, 40% of patients were from rural counties and were demographically similar to urban patients. Rural patients were more likely to present as a hospital transfer (15.4% vs 2.5%, p < 0.01), receive care at a critical access hospital (24.1% vs 1.0%, p < 0.01), receive care outside their home county (32.5% vs 12.8%, p < 0.01), and be transferred to another hospital after surgery. Rural and urban patients underwent similar procedures, with similar lengths of stay, cost of index hospitalization, and mortality. Rural geriatric patients in New Hampshire are more likely to receive care outside of their home county or be transferred to another hospital. Costs of care were similar but are likely underestimated for rural patients. There was no difference in unadjusted mortality. Further investigation is merited to determine the reasons for hospital transfer in the geriatric EGS population to evaluate which patients may benefit most from remaining close to home vs transferring to other facilities."

    "abstract": "Financial toxicity describes the harmful effect of individual treatment costs and fiscal burdens that have a compounding negative impact on outcomes in surgery. While this phenomenon has been widely studied in surgical oncology, the purpose of this study was to perform a novel exploration of the impact of financial toxicity in emergency general surgery (EGS) patients throughout the US. The Nationwide Readmissions Database for January and February 2018 was queried for all EGS patients aged 18 to 65 years. One-to-one propensity matching was performed with and without risk for financial toxicity. The primary outcome was mortality, and the secondary outcomes were venous thromboembolism (VTE), prolonged length of stay (LOS), and readmission within 30 days. There were 24,154 EGS patients propensity matched. The mortality rate was 0.2% (n = 39), and the rate of VTE was 0.5% (n = 113). With financial toxicity, there was no statistically significant difference for mortality (p = 0.08) or VTE (p = 0.30). The rate of prolonged LOS was 6.2% (n = 824), and the risk was increased with financial toxicity (risk ratio 1.24 [1.12 to 1.37]; p < 0.001). The readmission rate was 7.0% (n = 926), and the risk with financial toxicity was increased (risk ratio 1.21 [1.10 to 1.33]; p < 0.001). The mean count of comorbidities per patient per admission during readmission within 1 year with financial toxicity was 2.1 ± 1.9 versus 1.8 ± 1.7 without (p < 0.001). Despite little difference in the rate of mortality or VTE, EGS patients at risk for financial toxicity have an increased risk of readmission and longer LOS. Fewer comorbidities were identified at index admission than during readmission in patients at risk for financial toxicity. Future studies aimed at reducing this compounding effect of financial toxicity and identifying missed comorbidities have the potential to improve EGS outcomes."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to observe the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on acute general surgery in the first German \"hotspot\" regions of Heinsberg and Aachen, during the first months of the pandemic. The incidence and severity of acute appendicitis, acute cholecystitis and mechanical bowel obstruction, were compared between March and May 2020 and a control period (same months of the previous three years). Pre-, intra- and postoperative data was compared between three regional hospitals of Heinsberg and the closest maximum care, university hospital. A total of 592 operated patients were included, 141 belonging to the pandemic cohort and 451 to the historic cohort. The pandemic group showed higher rates of clinical peritonitis (38% vs. 27%, p = 0.015), higher rates of mean white blood cell count (13.2±4.4 /nl vs. 12.3±4.7 /nl, p = 0.044) and mean C-reactive protein (60.3±81.1 mg/l vs. 44.4±72.6 mg/l, p = 0.015) preoperatively. Specifically in patients with acute appendicitis, there were less patients with catarrhal appendicitis (23% vs. 35%, p = 0.021) and a tendency towards more advanced histological findings in the pandemic cohort. In the university hospital, a 42% reduction in acute operated cases was observed at the onset of the pandemic (n = 30 in 2020 vs. n = 52 in 2019), whereas in the peripheral hospitals of Heinsberg there was only a 10% reduction (n = 111 in 2020 vs. n = 123 in 2019). The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in our region was accompanied by advanced preoperative and intraoperative findings in patients undergoing emergency general surgery. A greater reduction in acute operated surgical cases was observed at the university hospital, in contrast to the smaller hospitals of Heinsberg, suggesting a possible shift of emergency patients, requiring immediate operation, from maximum care hospital to the periphery."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) diseases are time-sensitive conditions that require urgent surgical evaluation, yet the effect of geographic access to care on outcomes remains unclear. We examined the association of spatial access with outcomes for common EGS conditions. A retrospective analysis of twelve 2014 State Inpatient Databases, identifying adults admitted with eight EGS conditions, was performed. We assessed spatial access using the spatial access ratio (SPAR)-an advanced spatial model that accounts for travel distance, hospital capacity, and population demand, normalized against the national mean. Multivariable regression models adjusting for patient and hospital factors were used to evaluate the association between SPAR with (a) in-hospital mortality and (b) major morbidity. A total of 877,928 admissions, of which 104,332 (2.4%) were in the lowest-access category (SPAR, 0) and 578,947 (66%) were in the high-access category (SPAR, ≥1), were analyzed. Low-access patients were more likely to be White, male, and treated in nonteaching hospitals. Low-access patients also had higher incidence of complex EGS disease (low access, 31% vs. high access, 12%; p < 0.001) and in-hospital mortality (4.4% vs. 2.5%, p < 0.05). When adjusted for confounding factors, including presence of advanced hospital resources, increasing spatial access was protective against in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.94-0.97; p < 0.001). Spatial access was not significantly associated with major morbidity. This is the first study to demonstrate that geospatial access to surgical care is associated with incidence of complex EGS disease and that increasing spatial access to care is independently associated with lower in-hospital mortality. These results support the consideration of spatial access in the development of regional health systems for EGS care. Prognostic and Epidemiologic; Level III."

This study investigated the effect of laparoscopy on high-risk patients' post-operative care requirements. Data were retrieved for all patients entered into the NELA database between 2013 and 2018. Only high-risk surgical patients (P-POSSUM predicted mortality risk of ≥ 5%) were included. Patients undergoing laparoscopic and open emergency general surgical procedures were compared using a propensity score weighting approach. Outcome measures included total length of critical care (level 3) stay, overall length of stay and inpatient mortality. A total of 66,517 high-risk patients received emergency major abdominal surgery. A laparoscopic procedure was attempted in 6998 (10.5%); of these, the procedure was competed laparoscopically in 3492 (49.9%) and converted to open in 3506 (50.1%). Following inverse probability treatment weighting adjustment for patient disease and treatment characteristics, high-risk patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery had a shorter median ICU stay (1 day vs 2 days p < 0.001), overall hospital length of stay (11 days vs 14 days p < 0.001) and a lower inpatient mortality (16.0% vs 18.8%, p < 0.001). They were also less likely to have a prolonged ICU stay with an OR of 0.78 (95% CI 0.74-0.83, p < 0.001). The results of this study suggest that in patients at high risk of post-operative mortality, laparoscopic emergency bowel surgery leads to a reduced length of critical care stay, overall length of stay and inpatient mortality compared to traditional laparotomy."

This was an international, multi-institutional prospective observational study of patients requiring ES for IAI. Laparotomy before the transfer was an exclusion criterion. Patients were divided into groups: clinic/ED (C/ED), IP, or TP. Data collected included demographics, the severity of illness (SOI), procedures, OA, and number of laparotomies.

There were 752 study patients (C/ED 63.8% vs TP 23.4% and IP 12.8%), with a mean age of 59 years and 43.6% women. IP had worse SOI scores (Charlson Comorbidity Index, American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment).

Adjusting for age and SOI, only SOI had an impact on the risk of mortality (area under the curve 86%). IP had the highest unadjusted mortality after ES for IAI and was followed by the TP; SOI drove the risk of mortality. SR must be extended to IP for timely recognition of the IAI."

Scoring systems can also help benchmark acute care services. This study aims to compare different scoring systems in predicting outcomes among acute care surgery patients. Our study is a retrospective cohort study that included all adult emergency surgery admissions between 2017 and 2019. Data were obtained from patients' electronic health records. Same admission mortality and postoperative complications were collected. Data were recorded to calculate the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status classification system (ASA-PS), Shock Index Score (SI), Age Shock Index Score (AgeSI), and the Emergency Surgery Score (ESS). The probability of death and complications was correlated with each scoring system and was assessed by calculating the c-statistic. During the study period, 1606 patients fulfilled inclusion criteria. The mortality rate was 2.2%, complication rate was 18.7%. ESS predicted mortality with a c-statistic of 0.87 better than ASA-PS, AgeSI, and SI with a calculated c-statistic of 0.81, 0.74, and 0.57, respectively. ESS also predicted the occurrence of complications with a c-statistic of 0.83 better than ASA-PS, AgeSI, and SI with a calculated c-statistic of 0.72, 0.71, and 0.63, respectively. ESS demonstrated a better prognostic accuracy for hospital mortality and postoperative complications than other prognostic scoring systems. Our findings suggest that a scoring system designed for the acute care surgical population may provide enhanced prognostic performance over other surgical prognostic scoring systems."

Females had a higher admission shock index than males (0.91 vs. 0.81, p < 0.001) and a longer delay from admission until surgery (1.47 vs. 0.79 days, p < 0.001). Females and males had similar crude postoperative mortality (16.3% vs. 15.3%, p = 0.621). The final Cox proportional hazards regression model was based on the propensity-weighted cohort. The mortality hazard ratio was 0.65 among females compared to males (95% CI 0.46-0.92, p = 0.014). Our results show a survival advantage among female patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery despite sex-based disparities in access to surgical care that favors males. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying these findings."

    "abstract": "Quantitative futility is an appraisal of the risk of failure of a treatment. For those who do not survive, a laparotomy has provided negligible therapeutic benefit and may represent a missed opportunity for palliation. The aim of this study was to define a timeframe for quantitative futility in emergency laparotomy and investigate predictors of futility using the National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA) database. A two-stage methodology was used; stage one defined a timeframe for futility using an online survey and steering group discussion; stage two applied this definition to patients enrolled in NELA December 2013-December 2020 for analysis. Futility was defined as all-cause mortality within 3 days of emergency laparotomy. Baseline characteristics of this group were compared to all others. Multilevel logistic regression was carried out with potentially clinically important predictors defined a priori. Quantitative futility occurred in 4% of patients (7442/180,987). Median age was 74 years (range 65-81 years). Median NELA risk score was 32.4% vs. 3.8% in the surviving cohort (p < 0.001). Early mortality patients more frequently presented with sepsis (p < 0.001). Significant predictors of futility included age, arterial lactate and cardiorespiratory co-morbidity. Frailty was associated with a 38% increased risk of early mortality (95% CI 1.22-1.55). Surgery for intestinal ischaemia was associated with a two times greater chance of futile surgery (OR 2.67; 95% CI 2.50-2.85). Quantitative futility after emergency laparotomy is associated with quantifiable risk factors available to decision-makers preoperatively. These findings should be incorporated qualitatively by the multidisciplinary team into shared decision-making discussions with extremely high-risk patients."

    "title": "Operating room use for emergency general surgery cases: analysis of the Patterns of Complex Emergency General Surgery in Canada study.",
    "abstract": "Access to the operating room (OR) is variable among emergency general surgery (EGS) services, with some having dedicated EGS ORs, and others only a shared queue. Currently in Canada, only a limited number of acute care surgery services have dedicated daytime operating room (OR) access; hence, we aimed to describe the burden of after-hours EGS operating in Canada and differences associated with OR access. In this multicentre retrospective cohort study, we used data from a previously conducted study designed to evaluate nonappendiceal, nonbiliary disease across 8 Canadian hospitals. We performed a secondary analysis to describe booking priorities and timing of operative interventions, compare sites with and without access to a dedicated EGS daytime OR, and identify differences in morbidity and mortality based on timing of operative intervention. Among 1244 patients, operations were performed during weekday daytime in 521 cases (41.9%), in the evening in 279 (22.4%), on the weekend in 293 (23.6%) and overnight in 151 (12.1%). Operating room booking priority was more than 2 hours to 8 hours in 657 cases (52.8%), more than 8 hours to 24 hours in 334 (26.9%) and more than 24 hours to 48 hours in 253 (20.3%). Substantial variation in booking priority was observed for the same preoperative diagnoses. Sites with dedicated EGS ORs performed a greater proportion of cases during daytime versus overnight compared to sites without dedicated EGS ORs (198/237 [83.5%] v. 323/435 [74.2%], p = 0.006). No significant differences in outcome were found between cases performed during the daytime, evening and overnight. We found considerable variation in OR booking priority within the same preoperative diagnoses among EGS patients in Canada. Sites with dedicated EGS ORs performed more cases during weekday daytime compared to sites without dedicated EGS ORs; however, this study showed no evidence of compromised outcomes based on OR timing. Tous les services de chirurgie générale d’urgence (CGU) n’ont pas le même accès aux blocs opératoires (BO). Certains ont des BO dédiés, d’autres doivent se placer dans une file d’attente partagée. À l’heure actuelle, au Canada, seul un nombre limité de services de chirurgie d’urgence disposent de BO dédiés accessibles durant le jour. Nous avons donc voulu décrire le fardeau imposé aux services de CGU qui doivent opérer en dehors des heures régulières au Canada et les différences d’accès aux BO. Dans cette étude de cohorte multicentrique rétrospective, nous avons utilisé les données d’une étude précédente qui a porté sur des cas non liés à l’appendicite ou à la cholécystite dans 8 hôpitaux canadiens. Nous avons procédé à une analyse secondaire afin de décrire les priorités d’inscription et le moment des chirurgies, comparer les établissements pourvus ou non d’un accès à des BO dédiés pour les CGU durant le jour, et établir les différences de morbidité et de mortalité selon le moment des interventions. Sur un total de 1244 cas, les opérations ont été effectuées un jour de semaine et durant le jour dans 521 cas (41,9 %), le soir dans 279 cas (22,4 %), un jour de fin de semaine dans 293 cas (23,6 %) et la nuit dans 151 cas (12,1 %). La priorité d’inscription aux BO était de plus de 2 heures à 8 heures dans 657 cas (52,8 %), de plus de 8 heures à 24 heures dans 334 cas (26,9 %) et de plus de 24 heures à 48 heures dans 253 cas (20,3 %). On a observé une variation substantielle des priorités d’inscription pour de mêmes diagnostics préopératoires. Les hôpitaux pourvus de BO dédiés pour les CGU ont pris en charge un plus grand nombre de cas durant le jour plutôt que la nuit, comparativement aux établissements dépourvus de BO dédiés aux CGU (198/237 [83,5 %] c. 323/435 [74,2 %], p = 0,006). On n’a observé aucune différence en ce qui concerne l’issue des interventions selon qu’elles avaient eu lieu le jour, le soir ou la nuit. Nous avons constaté une variation substantielle des priorités d’inscription aux BO pour les mêmes diagnostics préopératoires dans les cas de CGU au Canada. Les établissements pourvus de BO dédiés pour les CGU ont opéré un plus grand nombre de cas les jours de semaine durant le jour que les établissements dépourvus de BO dédiés aux CGU; par contre, cette étude n’a mis au jour aucune complication associée au moment d’utilisation des BO."

CCI is adopted by Tokyo Guidelines as one of the main criteria in the management of acute cholecystitis. Our study evaluates the role of CCI in predicting difficult cholecystectomy.  Methods All patients who underwent cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis between January 2017 and September 2019 were included. CCI, Emergency Surgery Score (ESS), and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score were calculated and analyzed to assess their predictive value for difficult cholecystectomy. Results A total of 96 patients were included and allocated to difficult and non-difficult cholecystectomy groups. CCI was found to be a significant predictor of difficult cholecystectomy (OR 1.59; 59% CI, 1.04. 2.42; p= 0.031). Similarly, ESS was found to be a predictor tool of difficult cholecystectomy (OR 1.42; 59% CI, 1.05. 1.93; p= 0.024). There was no significant difference in adverse outcomes between the two groups. Conclusion CCI was able to predict a difficult cholecystectomy in our study population. However further studies are required to evaluate if it can be used as a predictor of adverse outcomes in the context of acute cholecystitis."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) patients often present with anemia, in which preoperative transfusions are performed to mitigate anemia-associated risks. However, transfusions have also been noted to cause worse postoperative outcomes. This study examined how transfusion-associated outcomes vary at different levels of anemia. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from 2005 to 2019 was used to identify patients who had undergone any of 12 major EGS procedures using Current Procedural Terminology codes. Patients were divided into two cohorts based on receipt of preoperative transfusion. Cohorts were subdivided into anemia severity levels and propensity score-matched within each using patient demographic and comorbidity variables. We analyzed 30-day postoperative outcomes, including morbidity, mortality, and return to odds ratio (OR), using univariate Chi-squared tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, and multivariate logistic regression analyses. 595,407 EGS cases were identified. Receiving preoperative transfusion were 44.45% (n = 3058) of severely anemic, 10.94% (n = 9076) of moderately anemic, 1.34% (n = 1370) of mildly anemic, and 0.174% (n = 704) of no anemia patients. Transfusion resulted in an increased overall morbidity in the severe (OR 1.54), moderate (OR 1.50), mild (OR 1.71), and no anemia (OR 1.85) groups. Mortality increased in the moderate (OR 1.27), mild (OR 1.61), and no anemia (OR 1.76) subgroups. In severe anemia, transfusion status and mortality were not significantly associated. Transfusion is associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates in those with higher hematocrit levels, even after controlling for pre-existing comorbidities. A restrictive transfusion strategy should be considered to avoid risks for those with a hematocrit level more than 24%."

To compare outcomes of AO via RT vs REBOA zone 1. This was a comparative effectiveness research study using a multicenter registry of postinjury AO from October 2013 to September 2021. AO via REBOA zone 1 (above celiac artery) was compared with RT performed in the emergency department of facilities experienced in both procedures and documented in the prospective multicenter Aortic Occlusion for Resuscitation in Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (AORTA) registry. Propensity score matching (PSM) with exact institution matching was used, in addition to subgroup multivariate analysis to control for confounders. The study setting included the ED, where AO via RT or REBOA was performed, and participants were adult trauma patients 16 years or older. AO via REBOA zone 1 vs RT. The primary outcome was survival. Secondary outcomes were ventilation-free days (VFDs), intensive care unit (ICU)-free days, discharge Glasgow Coma Scale score, and Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS). A total of 991 patients (median [IQR] age, 32 [25-48] years; 808 male individuals [81.9%]) with a median (IQR) Injury Severity Score of 29 (18-50) were included. Of the total participants, 306 (30.9%) had AO via REBOA zone 1, and 685 (69.1%) had AO via RT. PSM selected 112 comparable patients (56 pairs). REBOA zone 1 was associated with a statistically significant lower mortality compared with RT (78.6% [44] vs 92.9% [52]; P = .03). There were no significant differences in VFD greater than 0 (REBOA, 18.5% [10] vs RT, 7.1% [4]; P = .07), ICU-free days greater than 0 (REBOA, 18.2% [10] vs RT, 7.1% [4]; P = .08), or discharge GOS of 5 or more (REBOA, 7.5% [4] vs RT, 3.6% [2]; P = .38). Multivariate analysis confirmed the survival benefit of REBOA zone 1 after adjustment for significant confounders (relative risk [RR], 1.25; 95% CI, 1.15-1.36). In all subgroup analyses (cardiopulmonary resuscitation on arrival, traumatic brain injury, chest injury, pelvic injury, blunt/penetrating mechanism, systolic blood pressure ≤60 mm Hg on AO initiation), REBOA zone 1 offered an either similar or superior survival. Results of this comparative effectiveness research suggest that REBOA zone 1 provided better or similar survival than RT for patients requiring AO postinjury. These findings provide the ethically necessary equipoise between these therapeutic approaches to allow the planning of a randomized controlled trial to establish the safety and effectiveness of REBOA zone 1 for AO in trauma resuscitation."

    "abstract": "Acute Mesenteric Ischaemic (AMI) is a rare condition with significant morbidity and mortality. Many causes of AMI exist, which usually begin with mucosal injury. Onset is insiduous and there is frequent diagnostic delay. Current treatments can only control established injury and prevent propagation, hence new interventions are needed. The prevention and treatment of AMI by intraluminal delivery of oxygen has yet to be investigated in the clinical setting. This article aims to systemically review experimental studies investigating this novel therapy. Following the PRISMA guidelines, searches of PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE databases were performed up to June 2022. Two independent investigators extracted the data. There were 20 experimental studies, 16 of which used an occlusive ischaemia reperfusion model. Six different formulations were used to deliver intraluminal oxygen, with perflurocarbon being the most common. Studies consistently showed local and systemic benefits. Intraluminal oxygen therapy improved histological severity of mucosal injury in all studies when oxygen was delivered during the ischaemia phase, but could cause harm if given during the reperfusion phase. Improvement was also demonstrated in endpoints assessing intestinal function, biomarkers of intestinal damage, measures of systemic physiological derangement and mortality. Intraluminal oxygenation appears to be an effective treatment for AMI. There remain significant questions regarding optimal timing and delivery formulation before clinical translation of this treatment strategy."

    "abstract": "Pneumonia is the most common intensive care unit-acquired infection in the trauma and emergency general surgery population. Despite guidelines urging rapid antibiotic use, data supporting immediate antibiotic initiation in cases of suspected infection are limited. Our hypothesis was that a protocol of specimen-initiated antibiotic initiation would have similar compliance and outcomes to an immediate initiation protocol. We devised a pragmatic cluster-randomized crossover pilot trial. Four surgical and trauma intensive care units were randomized to either an immediate initiation or specimen-initiated antibiotic protocol for intubated patients with suspected pneumonia and bronchoscopically obtained cultures who did not require vasopressors. In the immediate initiation arm, antibiotics were started immediately after the culture regardless of patient status. In the specimen-initiated arm, antibiotics were delayed until objective Gram stain or culture results suggested infection. Each site participated in both arms after a washout period and crossover. Outcomes were protocol compliance, all-cause 30-day mortality, and ventilator-free alive days at 30 days. Standard statistical techniques were applied. A total of 186 patients had 244 total cultures, of which only the first was analyzed. Ninety-three patients (50%) were enrolled in each arm, and 94.6% were trauma patients (84.4% blunt trauma). The median age was 50.5 years, and 21% of the cohort was female. There were no differences in demographics, comorbidities, sequential organ failure assessment, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, or Injury Severity Scores. Antibiotics were started significantly later in the specimen-initiated arm (0 vs. 9.3 hours; p < 0.0001) with 19.4% avoiding antibiotics completely for that episode. There were no differences in the rate of protocol adherence, 30-day mortality, or ventilator-free alive days at 30 days. In this cluster-randomized crossover trial, we found similar compliance rates between immediate and specimen-initiated antibiotic strategies. Specimen-initiated antibiotic protocol in patients with a suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia did not result in worse clinical outcomes compared with immediate initiation.

Inpatient EGS opioid prescribing habits following laparoscopic cholecystectomy, laparoscopic and open inguinal hernia repair, or open umbilical hernia repair during the pre- and post-Acute Care Surgery Division-Quality Improvement (QI) periods were recorded retrospectively. Demographics, type and dose of opioids, and non-opioid adjuncts prescribed were collected. Opioids were converted to oral morphine equivalents (OME). Pre- and post-QI data were compared. Post-QI discharge opioids prescribed were compared to reported use of opioids. Patients' rating of pain management is reported. One hundred twenty-two and 62 patients were included during the pre- and post- QI periods, respectively. Post-QI, opioid prescribing decreased, and adjunct prescribing increased (31.1% vs. 72.6%; p < 0.001) at discharge. Interestingly, higher 24 h pre-discharge OME was associated with a higher OME prescribed at discharge (B = 1.255 [0.377 - 2.134]; p = 0.005). Of the 47 EGS patients who followed up in clinic post-ACS QI, 89.4% rated their pain management as excellent/good, 8.5% as fair, and 2.1% as poor. Implementation of a multifaceted approach to decrease opioid prescribing in the outpatient setting organically affected opioid prescribing habits at discharge for inpatients."

We describe outcomes of nonoperative management in a cohort of older EGS patients and estimate the projected risk of operative management using the NSQIP Surgical Risk Calculator (SRC). We studied single-center inpatients aged 65 y and more with an EGS consult who did not undergo an operation (January 2019-December 2020). For each patient, we recorded the surgeon's recommendation as either an operation was \"Not Needed\" (medical management preferred) or \"Not Recommended\" (risk outweighed benefits). Our main outcome of interest was mortality at 30 d and 1 y. Our secondary outcome of interest was SRC-projected 30-day postoperative mortality risk (median % [interquartile range]), calculated using hypothetical low-risk and high-risk operations. We included 204 patients (60% female, median age 75 y), for whom an operation was \"Not Needed\" in 81% and \"Not Recommended\" in 19%. In this cohort, 11% died at 30 d and 23% died at 1 y. Mortality was higher for the \"Not Recommended\" cohort (37% versus 5% at 30 d and 53% versus 16% at 1 y, P < 0.05). The SRC-projected 30-day postoperative mortality risk was 3.7% (1.3-8.7) for low-risk and 5.8% (2-11.8) for high-risk operations. Nonoperative management in older EGS patients is associated with very high risk of short-term and long-term mortality, particularly if a surgeon advised that risks of surgery outweighed benefits. The SRC may underestimate risk in the highest-risk patients."

A consensus on the risk factors for anastomotic leakage has not been established, and it is still unclear if peritonitis is a risk factor. This systematic review aimed to evaluate if an entero-entero/entero-colonic anastomosis is safe in patients with peritonitis undergoing abdominal acute care surgery. A systematic literature review based on PRISMA guidelines was performed, searching the databases Pubmed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Science Direct for studies of anastomosis in peritonitis. Patients with an anastomosis after non-planned small bowel resection (ischemia, perforation, or strangulation), including secondary peritonitis, were included. Elective laparotomies and colo-colonic anastomoses were excluded. Due to the etiology, traumatic perforation, in-vitro, and animal studies were excluded. This review identified 26 studies of small-bowel anastomosis in peritonitis with a total of 2807 patients. This population included a total of 889 small-bowel/right colonic resections with anastomoses, and 242 enterostomies. All studies, except two, were retrospective reviews or case series. The overall mortality rates were 0-20% and anastomotic leakage rates 0-36%. After performing a risk of bias evaluation there was no basis for conducting a meta-analysis. The quality of evidence was rated as low. There was no evidence to refute performing a primary small-bowel anastomosis in acute laparotomy with peritonitis. There is currently insufficient evidence to label peritonitis as a risk factor for anastomotic leakage in acute care laparotomy with small-bowel resection.

We sought to examine the association between SVI and outcomes after emergency general surgery. This study is a cross-sectional review of 887,193 Medicare beneficiaries who underwent 1 of 4 common emergency general surgery procedures (appendectomy, cholecystectomy, colectomy, and ventral hernia repair) performed in the urgent or emergent setting between 2014 and 2018. These data were merged with the SVI at the census-track level of residence. Risk-adjusted outcomes (30-day mortality, serious complications, readmission) were evaluated using a logistic regression model accounting for age, sex, comorbidity, year, procedure type, and hospital characteristics between high and low social vulnerability quintiles and within the 4 SVI subthemes (socioeconomic status; household composition and disability; minority status and language; and housing type and transportation). Compared with beneficiaries with low social vulnerability, Medicare beneficiaries living in areas of high social vulnerability experienced higher rates of 30-day mortality (8.56% vs 8.08%; adjusted odds ratio 1.07; p < 0.001), serious complications (20.71% vs 18.40%; adjusted odds ratio 1.17; p < 0.001), and readmissions (16.09% vs 15.03%; adjusted odds ratio 1.08; p < 0.001). This pattern of differential outcomes was present in subgroup analysis of all 4 SVI subthemes but was greatest in the socioeconomic status and household composition and disability subthemes. National efforts to support patients with high social vulnerability from natural disasters may be well aligned with efforts to identify communities that are particularly vulnerable to worse postoperative outcomes after emergency general surgery. Policies targeting structural barriers related to household composition and socioeconomic status may help alleviate these disparities."

The literature indicates that an escalating, combined endoscopic, interventional radiology and minimally invasive surgery \"step-up\" approach, such as video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement, may reduce the number of required SPNs and ICU complications, such as multiple organ failure. We hypothesized that complications for surgically treated severe necrotizing pancreatitis patients decreased during the period of adoption of the \"step-up\" approach. The American college of surgeons national surgery quality improvement program database (ACS-NSQIP) was used to find SPN cases from 2007 to 2019 in ACS-NSQIP submitting hospitals. Mortality and Clavien-Dindo class 4 (CD4) ICU complications were collected. Predictors of outcomes were identified by univariate and multivariate analyses. There were 2457 SPN cases. SPN cases decreased from 0.09% in 2007 to 0.01% in 2019 of NSQIP operative cases (p < 0.001). Overall mortality was 8.5% and did not decrease with time. CD4 complications decreased from 40 to 27% (p < 0.001). There was a 65% reduction in SPN cases requiring a return to the operating room. Multivariate predictors of complications were emergency general surgery (EGS, p < 0.001), serum albumin (p < 0.0001) and modified frailty index (mFI) (p < 0.0001). Multivariate predictors of mortality were EGS (p < 0.0001), serum albumin (p < 0.0001), and mFI (p < 0.04). The mFI decreased after 2010 (p < 0.001). SPNs decreased after 2010, with decreasing CD4 complications, decreasing reoperation rates and stable mortality rates, likely indicating broad adoption of a \"step-up\" approach. Larger, prospective studies to compare indications and outcomes for \"step up\" versus open SPN are warranted."

Few studies have systematically examined this practice. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of delayed abdominal closure on postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients with AMI. We performed a retrospective cohort study of the ACS-NSQIP 2013-2017 registry. We included patients with a diagnosis of AMI undergoing emergency laparotomy. Patients were divided into two groups based on the type of abdominal closure: (1) delayed fascial closure (DFC) when no layers of the abdominal wall were closed and (2) immediate fascial closure (IFC) if deep layers or all layers of the abdominal wall were closed. Propensity score matching was performed based on comorbidities, pre-operative, and operative characteristics. Univariable analysis was performed on the matched sample. The propensity-matched cohort consisted of 1520 patients equally divided into the DFC and IFC groups. The median (IQR) age was 68 (59-77), and 836 (55.0%) were female. Compared to IFC, the DFC group showed increased in-hospital mortality (38.9% vs. 31.6%, p = 0.002), 30-day mortality (42.4% vs. 36.3%, p = 0.012), and increased risk of respiratory failure (59.5% vs. 31.2%, p < 0.001). The delayed fascial closure technique was associated with increased mortality compared to immediate fascial closure.

A series of weighted logistic regression models was created to determine the association of race/ethnicity with the primary outcome while controlling for patient and hospital characteristics. Of 387,610 weighted patient encounters from 989 hospitals, 59,395 patients (15.3%) underwent IHT. Compared with non-Hispanic White patients, rates of IHT were significantly lower for non-Hispanic Black (15% vs. 17%; unadjusted odds ratio (uOR) [95% confidence interval (CI)], 0.58 [0.49-0.68]; p < 0.001), Hispanic/Latinx (HL) (9.0% vs. 17%; uOR [95% CI], 0.48 [0.43-0.54]; p < 0.001), Asian/Pacific Islander (Asian/PI) (11% vs. 17%; uOR [95% CI], 0.84 [0.78-0.91]; p < 0.001), and other race/ethnicity (12% vs. 17%; uOR [95% CI], 0.68 [0.57-0.81]; p < 0.001) patients. In multivariable models, the adjusted odds of IHT remained significantly lower for HL (adjusted odds ratio [95% CI], 0.76 [0.72-0.83]; p < 0.001) and Asian/PI patients (adjusted odds ratio [95% CI], 0.73 [0.62-0.86]; p < 0.001) but not for non-Hispanic Black and other race/ethnicity patients ( p > 0.05). In a nationally representative sample of emergency departments across the United States, patients of minority race/ethnicity presenting with complex EGS disease were less likely to undergo IHT when compared with non-Hispanic White patients. Disparities persisted for HL and Asian/PI patients when controlling for comorbid conditions, hospital and residential geography, neighborhood socioeconomic status, and insurance; these patients may face unique barriers in accessing surgical care.

    "abstract": "As the American population ages, the number of geriatric adults requiring emergency general surgery (EGS) care is increasing. EGS regionalization could significantly affect the pattern of care for rural older adults. The aim of this study was to determine the current pattern of care for geriatric EGS patients at our rural academic center, with a focus on transfer status. We performed a retrospective chart review of patients aged ≥65 undergoing EGS procedures within 48 h of admission from 2014 to 2019 at our rural academic medical center. We collected demographic, admission, operative, and outcomes data. The primary outcomes of interest were mortality and nonhome discharge. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Over the 5-y study period, 674 patients underwent EGS procedures, with 407 (60%) transferred to our facility. Transfer patients (TPs) had higher American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) scores (P < 0.001), higher rates of open abdomen (13% versus 5.6%, P = 0.001), and multiple operations (24 versus 11%, P < 0.001) than direct admit patients. However, after adjustment there was no difference in mortality (OR 1.64; 95% CI, 0.82-3.38) or nonhome discharge (OR 1.49; 95% CI, 0.95-2.36). At our institution, the majority of rural geriatric EGS patients were transferred from another hospital for care. These patients had higher medical and operative complexity than patients presenting directly to our facility for care. After adjustment, transfer status was not independently associated with in-hospital mortality or nonhome discharge. These patients were appropriately transferred given their level of complexity."

The patient stated that he had nausea, vomiting, and constipation for a few weeks prior to the presentation. He also reported that he had a reducible, asymptomatic left inguinal hernia for the past 20 years. He began to experience pain in the left groin related to the hernia recently. During the past two weeks, he was having liquid bowel movements, and his last bowel movement occurred the morning of presentation. The patient did not report any fevers, chills, shortness of breath, or chest pain. His physical examination was remarkable for left lower quadrant fullness and mild abdominal distension. A large incarcerated left inguinoscrotal hernia was present, which markedly displaced and engulfed his penis. The patient was taken to the operating room for open inguinal hernia repair with mesh, where stomach and small bowel were encountered within the hernia sac. There was no ischemia noted, thus we repaired the hernia with mesh. The patient tolerated the procedure well and progressed postoperatively without incident. He was successfully discharged on postoperative day one. This case and literary review is a reference to the practicing general surgeon treating an incarcerated hernia containing the stomach."

    "abstract": "Multiple studies have validated the Emergency Surgery Score (ESS) as a tool which reliably predicts outcomes after emergency general surgery. The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of the ESS for lower-extremity endovascular procedures in nonelective setting (neLEE). The American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was retrospectively analyzed for patients undergoing neLEE between 2015 and 2019. The performance of the ESS in predicting mortality in each procedure was assessed using receiver operating characteristic analyses. Four thousand five hundred and eighty three patients underwent neLEE with median age 68 (±12.3 SD), with 1802 females (39.3%). The ESS correlated with 30-day mortality (area under the curve [AUC] was 0.729), discharge to rehab (AUC 0.638), renal failure (AUC 0.667), postintervention ventilation requirement (AUC 0.680), and stroke (AUC 0.656). The predictive ability of the ESS decreased with increasing age, with the ESS performing best for patients between 60 and 69 y in age (AUC 0.735) and worst for patients above 80 y (AUC 0.650). A Cochran-Armitage test showed linear trend towards increased 30-day mortality among the quartiles with increasing ESS (P < 0.001), with patients with ESS ≥10 having 10 times odds of increased 30-day mortality compared to reference quartile of patients with ESS ≤4 on multivariate analysis. The ESS score is associated with 30-day mortality and other complications after neLEE procedures. It can potentially be used as a predictive tool for preoperative risk stratification and can also be used for equitably evaluating standards and outcomes after lower extremity endovascular procedures."

A systematic literature search in PubMed and Embase was performed on the May 1, 2021. Only comparative studies on care bundles in major emergency general surgery were included. Meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis were performed on 30-d mortality. We undertook a narrative approach of long-term mortality, complications, and length of stay. Meta-analysis of 13 studies with 35,771 patients demonstrated that care bundles in emergency surgery were not associated with a significant reduction in odds of 30-d mortality (odds ratio = 0.8, 95% confidence interval 0.62-1.03). Trial sequential analysis confirmed that the meta-analysis was underpowered with a minimum of 78,901 patients required for firm conclusions. Seven studies reported complication rates whereof six reported lower complication rates using care bundles. Care bundles were reported to decrease postoperative complications in five out of seven studies and seven out of 11 studies reported a shortening in length of stay."

However, this association has not been examined in the geriatric population stratified by emergency general surgery procedural risk. A retrospective cohort study was performed using the 2012 to 2017 American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. We identified geriatric patients (age ≥65 years) undergoing an emergency general surgery procedure within 48 hours of admission stratified by the procedural risk. Frailty was accessed using Modified 5-item Frailty Index, and the patients were divided into 4 groups Modified 5-item Frailty Index = 0, 1, 2, and ≥3. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the impact of increasing Modified 5-item Frailty Index score on postoperative complications, failure-to-rescue, and readmissions. In the study, 16,911 low risk procedure emergency general surgery patients were grouped as (33.3%) Modified 5-item Frailty Index = 0, (45.1%) Modified 5-item Frailty Index = 1, (18.7%) Modified 5-item Frailty Index = 2, and (2.9%) Modified 5-item Frailty Index ≥3 respectively. After multivariable analyses, increasing Modified 5-item Frailty Index score (versus Modified 5-item Frailty Index = 0) was associated with complications (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]; Modified 5-item Frailty Index = 2: 2.1 [1.3-3.5], Modified 5-item Frailty Index ≥ 3: 2.2 [1.2-4.2]), failure-to-rescue (Modified 5-item Frailty Index = 2: 2.3 [1.3-4.0], Modified 5-item Frailty Index ≥ 3: 2.3 [1.2-4.6]), readmission (Modified 5-item Frailty Index = 2: 1.4 [1.2-1.7], Modified 5-item Frailty Index ≥ 3: 1.5 [1.1-2.1]). In addition, 30,305 high-risk patients undergoing procedure emergency general surgery were grouped as (24.1%) Modified 5-item Frailty Index = 0, (44.9%) Modified 5-item Frailty Index = 1, (24.0%) Modified 5-item Frailty Index = 2, and (7.0%) Modified 5-item Frailty Index ≥3, respectively. After multivariable analyses, increasing Modified 5-item Frailty Index score (versus Modified 5-item Frailty Index = 0) was associated with complications (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]; Modified 5-item Frailty Index = 2: 1.2 [1.2-1.3], Modified 5-item Frailty Index ≥3: 1.7 [1.5-2.0]), failure-to-rescue (Modified 5-item Frailty Index = 2: 1.3 [1.2-1.5], Modified 5-item Frailty Index ≥3: 1.5 [1.3-1.7]), readmission (Modified 5-item Frailty Index = 2: 1.3 [1.2-1.4], Modified 5-item Frailty Index ≥3: 1.6 [1.4-1.9]). Increasing levels of frailty in geriatric emergency general surgery patients are associated with higher levels of postoperative complications, failure-to-rescue, and readmission. Clinicians should consider frailty in assessing the risk of even low-risk surgeries in this population."

We sought to utilize a supervised machine learning method to determine combinations of factors with the greatest influence on long-term survival in older EGS patients. We identified community dwelling participants admitted for EGS conditions from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey linked with claims (1992-2013). We categorized three binary domains of multimorbidity: chronic conditions, functional limitations, and geriatric syndromes (such as vision or hearing impairment, falls, incontinence). We also collected EGS disease type, age, and sex. We created a classification and regression tree (CART) model to identify groups of variables associated with our outcome of interest, three-year survival. We then performed Cox proportional hazards analysis to determine hazard ratios for each group with the lowest risk group as reference. We identified 1960 patients (median age 79 [interquartile range [IQR]: 73, 85], 59.5% female). The CART model identified the presence of functional limitations as the primary splitting variable. The lowest risk group were patient aged ≤81 y with biliopancreatic disease and without functional limitations. The highest risk group was men aged ≥75 y with functional limitations (hazard ratio [HR] 11.09 (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.91-20.83)). Notably absent from the CART model were chronic conditions and geriatric syndromes. More than the presence of chronic conditions or geriatric syndromes, functional limitations are an important predictor of long-term survival and must be included in presurgical assessment."

To inform cost reduction efforts, we sought to measure variability in hospital costs for short stay emergent laparoscopic appendectomy. VIZIENT Clinical Data Base was queried for adult and pediatric patients who underwent emergent laparoscopic appendectomy for appendicitis with length of stay ≤3 days. We extracted calendar FY 2019 direct costs (DC) by age group and diagnosis code for sites reporting at least 5 cases. Costs in the database are derived from actual charges multiplied by a site- and cost center-specific cost-to-charge ratio. Labor portions are scaled by the area wage index. Sites were ranked by vigintile of DC per case to provide confidentiality and blinding. In a total of 128 hospitals, median number of cases per site was 35.5 (Interquartile range (IQR) 20-65) with a total of 6585 cases analyzed. Highest cost centers by descending order were OR, Medical/Surgical Supplies, Routine Floor Care, Pharmacy, Emergency Room, Anesthesia, Laboratory, and CT scans, with all others each less than 2% of total costs. The relation between OR costs and total costs was strong but not complete. Mean DC per case was $4609. DC did not correlate with age, diagnosis code, or case volume per site. Wide variation in cost of laparoscopic appendectomy among medical centers suggests potential for significant cost reduction. Strategic opportunities in cost reduction appear to lie inside and outside the OR. Wide variation in cost of laparoscopic appendectomy and individual cost centers suggest a multi-pronged cost-reduction strategy should be used."

This study explores the ESS's predictive ability and reliability in the Jordanian surgical population. A retrospective validation study. A tertiary hospital in Jordan. A database was created including patients who underwent emergent surgery in King Abdullah University Hospital from January 2017 to June 2021. Relevant preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative variables were retrospectively and systematically gathered, and the ESS was calculated for each patient accordingly. In addition, a multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the correlations between the ESS and postoperative mortality and morbidity along with intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. Out of total of 1452 patients evaluated, 1322 patients were enrolled based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The mean age of the population was 47.9 years old. 91.9% of the patients were admitted to the surgical ward through the emergency department, while the rest were referred from inpatient and outpatient facilities. The mortality and postoperative complication rates were 3.9% and 13.5%, respectively. Mortality rates increased as the ESS score gradually increased, and the ESS was evaluated as a strong predictor with a c-statistic value of 0.842 (95% CI 0.743 to 0.896). The postoperative complication and ICU admission rate also increased with reciprocal rises in the ESS. They were also evaluated as accurate predictors with a c-statistic value of 0.724 (95% CI 0.682 to 0.765) and a c-statistic value of 0.825 (95% CI 0.784 to 0.866), respectively. The ESS is a robust, accurate predictor of postoperative mortality and morbidity of emergency general surgery patients. Furthermore, it is an all-important tool to enhance emergency general surgery practices, in terms of mitigating risk, quality of care measures and patient counselling."

We sought to characterize the true burden of emergency general surgery among hospitalized complex cardiac patients. We performed a retrospective analysis of the 2016-2017 National Inpatient Sample. We included adult patients with a primary diagnosis of complex cardiac disease. We then compared patients who underwent emergency general surgery (GS-OR) with those who did not (non-GS-OR). The primary outcome was mortality; secondary outcomes included length of stay and hospitalization costs. We identified 10.2 million patients with a primary diagnosis of complex cardiac disease, of which 148,309 (1.4%) underwent GS-OR. Mortality rates were significantly higher in the GS-OR group (11.0% versus 5.0%, P < 0.001). Among all cardiac patients, GS-OR was associated with 2.2 times increased odds of death (aOR: 2.2, P < 0.001). GS-OR patients also had longer length of stays (14.1 versus 5.8 d, P < 0.001). Among all cardiac patients, GS-OR was associated with an 8.1-day longer length of stay (P < 0.001). GS-OR patients were less often routinely discharged home (31.7% versus 45.3%, P < 0.001) and incurred higher inpatient costs ($46,136 versus $16,303, P < 0.001). Among all cardiac patients, GS-OR patients incurred $30,102 higher hospitalization costs (P < 0.001). Emergency general surgery among cardiac surgery patients is associated with a greater than two-fold increase in mortality, longer length of stays, higher rates of nonroutine discharge, and higher hospitalization costs. Emergency general surgery complications account for 4.0% of total inpatient costs of cardiac surgery patients and merit further study."

Our objective was to estimate the portion of the Ontario population with potential access to 24/7 EGS care. Geographic information system-based network-analysis was used to model 15-, 30-, 45-, 60-, and 90-min land transport catchment areas for hospitals providing EGS care, 24/7 emergency department (ED) access, and/or 24/7 operating room (OR) access. The capabilities of hospitals to provide each service were derived from a prior survey. Population counts were based on 2016 census blocks, and the 2019 road network for Ontario was used to determine speed limits and driving restrictions. Ninety-six percent of the Ontario population (n = 12,933,892) lived within 30-min's driving time to a hospital that provides any EGS care. The availability of 24/7 EDs was somewhat more limited, with 95% (n = 12,821,747) having potential access at 30-min. Potential access to all factors, including 24/7 ORs, was only possible for 93% (n = 12,471,908) of people at 30-min. Populations with potential access were tightly clustered around metropolitan centers. Supplementation of 24/7 OR capabilities, particularly in centers with existing 24/7 ED infrastructure, is most likely to improve access without the need for new hospitals."

This study aimed to describe the current management and outcomes of patients admitted with SBO in Denmark. This was a prospective cohort study conducted at six acute hospitals in Denmark over a 4-month period. Patients aged ≥ 18 years with a clinical or radiological diagnosis of SBO were eligible. Primary outcomes were 30 day morbidity and mortality rates. 316 patients were included during the study period. The median age was 72 years and 56% were female. Diagnosis was made by computed tomography (CT) in 313 patients (99.1%), with the remaining three diagnosed clinically. Non-operative management was the initial strategy in 152 patients (48.1%) and successful in 119 (78.3%). Urgent surgery was performed in the remaining 164 (51.9%), with a laparoscopic approach used in 84 patients (51.2%). The entire cohort had a 30 day mortality rate of 7.3% and a 30 day morbidity rate of 17.1%. The management of SBO in Denmark differs markedly to previous international reports, with an almost ubiquitous use of CT for diagnosis and a high proportion of patients undergoing urgent surgery. Despite higher rates of surgery, patient outcomes are broadly similar to reports of more conservative strategies, perhaps due to a reduction in delayed operations.

This was an IRB-approved (2020H0317) retrospective longitudinal study of patients undergoing mesh or non-mesh VHR from 2009-2019 at a single tertiary-care institution. The electronic medical record was used to collect sociodemographic, clinical, and intraoperative details, and early (≤ 30 days) and long-term (> 30-day) postoperative complications. Up to ten-year follow-up was obtained for long-term complications, categorized as: hernia recurrence reoperation (HRR), major complications requiring emergency surgery (MCES) (defined as non-elective operations related to the abdominal wall), and non-recurrence procedural intervention (NRPI) (defined as any procedures related to the abdominal wall, bowel, or mesh). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were obtained for each long-term complication. Of the 645 patients identified, the mean age at index operation was 52.51 ± 13.57 years with 50.70% female. Of the index operations, 21.24% were for a recurrence. Procedure categories included: 57.36% incisional, 37.21% non-incisional umbilical, 8.22% non-incisional epigastric, 3.88% parastomal, 0.93% diastasis recti, and 0.47% Spigelian hernias. Operative approaches included open (n = 383), laparoscopic (n = 267), and robotic (n = 21). Fascial closure (81.55%) and mesh use (66.2%) were performed in the majority of cases. Median follow-up time was 2098 days (interquartile range 1320-2806). The rate of short-term complications was 4.81% for surgical site infections, 15.04% for surgical site occurrences, and 13.64% for other complications. At 10 years, the HRR-free survival probability was 85.26%, MCES-free survival probability was 94.44%, and NRPI-free survival probability was 78.11%. A high proportion of patients experienced long-term recurrence and complications requiring intervention after index VHR. For many patients, a ventral hernia develops into a chronic medical condition. Improved efforts at post-market surveillance of operative approaches and mesh location and type should be undertaken to help optimize outcomes."

    "abstract": "Post-operative complications following emergency abdominal surgery are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite the knowledge of prognostic factors associated with poor surgical outcomes; few have described risks of poor outcomes based on admission information in acute surgical setting. We aimed to derive a simple, point-of-care risk scale that predicts adults with increased risk of poor outcomes. We used data from an international multi-centre prospective cohort study. The effect of characteristics; age, hypoalbuminaemia, anaemia, renal insufficiency and polypharmacy on 90-day mortality was examined using fully adjusted multivariable models. For our secondary outcome we aimed to test whether these characteristics could be combined to predict poor outcomes in adults undergoing emergency general surgery. Subsequently, the impact of incremental increase in derived SHARP score on outcomes was assessed. The cohort consisted of 419 adult patients between the ages of 16-94 years (median 52; IQR(39) consecutively admitted to five emergency general surgical units across the United Kingdom and one in Ghent, Belgium. In fully adjusted models the aforementioned characteristics; were associated with 90-day mortality. SHARP score was associated with higher odds of mortality in adults who underwent emergency general surgery, with a SHARP score of five also being associated with an increased length of hospital stay. SHARP risk score is a simple prognostic tool, using point-of-care information to predict poor outcomes in patients undergoing emergency general surgery. This information may be used to improve management plans and aid clinicians in delivering more person-centred care. Further validation studies are required to prove its utility."

A total of 5,027 patients underwent infrainguinal open revascularization procedures in the nonelective setting with median age 68 (±11.66 standard deviation), with 1,666 females (33.1%). The 30-day mortality rate was 2.7%. The Emergency Surgery Score correlated with 30-day mortality (area under the curve was 0.738). The Emergency Surgery Score also predicted risk of death/discharge to hospice (area under the curve 0.756), discharge to rehab (area under the curve 0.643), renal failure (area under the curve 0.741), postintervention ventilation requirement (0.684), stroke (0.717), cardiopulmonary arrest (0.657), and septic shock (0.697). A cumulative frequency table of mortality with Emergency Surgery Score was used to partition patients into quartiles of Emergency Surgery Score ≤5, Emergency Surgery Score of 6, Emergency Surgery Score of 7 or 8, and Emergency Surgery Score ≥9. A Cochran-Armitage test showed linear trend toward increased 30-day mortality among the quartiles with increasing Emergency Surgery Score (P < .001), with quartile 4 (Emergency Surgery Score ≥10) having 13 times odds of increased 30-day mortality compared to reference quartile 1 (Emergency Surgery Score ≤4). Emergency Surgery Score performance accurately predicts mortality for infrainguinal open revascularization procedures in the nonelective setting procedures. It may be useful for preoperative risk stratification and for national benchmarking after nonelective open lower extremity procedures."

    "abstract": "Subtotal laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SUB) is an alternative to total laparoscopic cholecystectomy (TOT) when the critical view of safety (CVS) cannot be achieved. Little is known about the clinical factors and postoperative outcomes associated with SUB. The objective was to determine predictive factors and outcomes of SUB as compared to TOT. Clinical data from patients admitted from our emergency department to the acute care surgery service who underwent SUB or TOT by an acute care surgery surgeon for acute biliary disease (2017-2019) were reviewed. Wilcoxon rank-sum and Fisher's exact tests were used. 355 patients underwent cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis; 28 were SUB (7.9%). SUB patients were more likely to be older (57 versus 43 y; P = 0.015), male (60.7% versus 39.3%; P < 0.001), have a history of cirrhosis or liver disease (14.3% versus 2.1%; P = 0.007), and have a higher Charlson-Comorbidity Index (1 versus 0, P = 0.041). SUB had greater leukocytosis (14.6 versus 10.9; P < 0.001), higher total bilirubin (0.9 versus 0.6; P = 0.021), and a higher Tokyo grade (2 versus 1; P < 0.001), and had operative findings including gallbladder decompression (82.1% versus 23.2%; P < 0.001) and inability to achieve the CVS (78.6% versus 3.4%; P < 0.001). SUB patients had an increased length of stay (4 versus 2 d; P < 0.001) and more 1-y readmissions. No major vascular injuries occurred in either group with one biliary injury in the TOT group. SUB patients present with more significant markers of biliary disease and have more complicated intraoperative and postoperative courses. However, the lack of biliary or vascular injuries suggests that SUB may represent a safe alternative when the CVS cannot be achieved."

    "abstract": "Incarcerated and strangulated hernias are a common clinical presentation encompassing several challenges in acute care surgery. The role of laparoscopy is still controversial and the data is scarce. Laparoscopy enables better evaluation of the incarcerated organ and its viability. The use of mesh repair in these emergent operations is also a major concern. In this series we aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic emergent repairs of acutely incarcerated and strangulated hernias, and their long-term results, in comparison to the conventional open repairs. Retrospective review of prospectively collected data of all adult patients, between the ages of 18 and 89, who underwent emergent operation due to an incarcerated and strangulated hernia between November 2017 and December 2020. During the study period, 89 patients underwent emergent operation due to incarcerated hernias-63 laparoscopic repair and 26 underwent an open repair. In the laparoscopic group (LG) 38 patients had a groin hernia and 25 had a ventral hernia, while in the open group (OG) the distribution was 12 and 14, respectively. When operated laparoscopically, all groin hernias but one were repaired in the TAPP approach and most ventral hernias were repaired using the IPOM + approach. During the peri-operative period there were 3 mortalities (1 in the LG). There were no significant differences between the groups in minor or major complications. Mean follow-up time in the LG was 27.9 months and 29.4 months in the OG. There was no significant difference in recurrence rates. Long-term results showed better outcome in the LG regarding pain at rest, difficulty doing exercise and local discomfort. Laparoscopic emergent repair of incarcerated hernias is a safe and feasible approach, with better short and long-term results compared to the open approach."

    "abstract": "While emergent, non-cardiac surgery can be safely performed in LVAD patients, the inherent perioperative challenges of these rare procedures and the perception that these patients may be poor surgical candidates can contribute to reluctance to perform necessary emergency general surgery (EGS) procedures. We, therefore, sought to identify predictors of inpatient mortality to assist perioperative decision-making. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2010-2015Q3) was used to identify patients with previously placed LVADs with a subsequent EGS admission diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of 30-day mortality, and a risk-adjusted probability of death was calculated for significant patient subgroups across age. Additional demographic variables were included in the regression due to clinical relevance. There were 1805 (weighted) LVAD-EGS patients with an overall mortality rate of 11%. Independent predictors of mortality were intestinal ischemia and sepsis present on admission. Patients older than 70 with sepsis had an 80% probability of in-hospital mortality (10.6 OR, 1.70-65.5 95% CI) while those over 70 presenting with intestinal ischemia had a 38% probability of death (3.6 OR, 1.50-8.78 95% CI). Mortality risk for younger patients with sepsis was still approximately 50%. Older LVAD patients presenting with either sepsis or intestinal ischemia have a substantial mortality risk while younger patients have a modest risk. These results can be used to guide treatment discussions when emergency surgery is being considered in LVAD patients."

    "abstract": "The burden of infections in acute care surgery (ACS) is huge. Surgical emergencies alone account for three million admissions per year in the United States (US) with estimated financial costs of USD 28 billion per year. Acute care facilities and ACS patients represent boost sanctuaries for the emergence, development and transmission of infections and multi-resistant organisms. According to the World Health Organization, healthcare-associated infections affected around 4 million cases in Europe and 1.7 million in the US alone in 2011 with 39,000 and 99,000 directly attributable deaths, respectively. In this scenario, antimicrobial resistance arose as a public-health emergency that worsens patients' morbidity and mortality and increases healthcare costs. The optimal patient care requires the application of comprehensive evidence-based policies and strategies aiming at minimizing the impact of healthcare associated infections and antimicrobial resistance, while optimizing the treatment of intra-abdominal infections. The present review provides a snapshot of two hot topics, such as antimicrobial resistance and systemic inflammatory response, and three milestones of infection management, such as source control, infection prevention, and control and antimicrobial stewardship."

    "abstract": "Background The coronavirus pandemic has caused global disruption to all aspects of life. This disturbance has been most notable in the medical world. Political, societal, medical, and behavioral alterations have forced emergency surgical practices to adapt. This study investigated the impact of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) at a busy surgical center. Methodology This is a retrospective observational study. Three study periods were analyzed: pre-COVID, first wave, and second wave. Data were collected on referrals, diagnoses, investigations, management pathways, outcomes, patient behavior, and consultant practice. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA test) was used for the analysis of parametric data and the Mann-Whitney U test for non-parametric data. Results Declining numbers of patients presented across the three periods. There was a severe disruption in performing emergency general surgeries during the first wave, propagated by alterations in clinical decision-making, as well as fluctuations in societal and patient behavior. Despite the effects of the second wave being significantly more profound in terms of hospitalization and COVID-related mortality, a paradoxical, gradual return to the norm was noted, which was seen in referral pathways, imaging decisions, and management strategies. Conclusion Our data is suggestive of society, both within and outside the medical sphere, adjusting to life with COVID-19."

    "title": "Cecal Perforation Secondary to Large Bowel Obstruction From a Tubo-Ovarian Abscess.",
    "abstract": "With the continued specialization of medicine, we as physicians often fall into the trap of placing pathologies into silos, focusing on what we are most practiced in caring for. When managing acute patients, it is important that we consider complications that can arise across systems and specialties which could place our patients at increased risk for morbidity and mortality. Tubo-ovarian abscesses (TOAs) are complex infections often arising in the setting of pelvic inflammatory disease. The resultant reactive inflammation is frequently the culprit of potentially fatal sequelae. This article looks to highlight a case of TOA that resulted in inflammation and obstruction of the adjacent large bowel which subsequently led to large bowel obstructions (LBOs) and perforation. Although LBO management is well described in the literature, perforation secondary to inflammatory compression from a TOA is rarely documented. We present the case of a middle-aged female with significant comorbid conditions and recent prolonged retention of a tampon which likely acted as the nidus for the infection that led to her presenting pathology and need for admission, a left-sided TOA measuring 8.1 × 4.7 × 3.4 cm. Consultation by obstetrics-gynecology and interventional radiology determined that admission for observation and intravenous antibiotics alone was appropriate. The patient's hospital course was complicated by enlarging TOA with peri-colonic abscess and acute decompensation in the setting of LBO and cecal perforation. Emergency laparotomy and right hemicolectomy by the acute care surgical team were performed. Postoperative management was complicated by septic shock which prolonged her hospital stay. Following inpatient optimization of nutrition and management of comorbid conditions, the patient was able to make a full recovery. In patients with suspected TOA, special consideration should be given to surrounding structures, and potentially fatal complications should be kept in the forefront of the primary team's minds. This case report aims to urge physicians caring for patients with TOA to maintain a high level of suspicion and consider how the benefits of aggressive management may outweigh those of conservative options."

    "title": "IMPACT OF TIME TO EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT RESUSCITATIVE AORTIC OCCLUSION AFTER NONCOMPRESSIBLE TORSO HEMORRHAGE.",
    "abstract": "Introduction: Time is an essential element in outcomes of trauma patients. The relationship of time to treatment in management of noncompressible torso hemorrhage (NCTH) with resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) or resuscitative thoracotomy (RT) has not been previously described. We hypothesized that shorter times to intervention would reduce mortality. Methods: A review of the Aortic Occlusion for Resuscitation in Trauma and Acute Care Surgery registry from 2013 to 2022 was performed to identify patients who underwent emergency department aortic occlusion (AO). Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the impact of time to treatment on mortality. Results: A total of 1,853 patients (1,245 [67%] RT, 608 [33%] REBOA) were included. Most patients were male (82%) with a median age of 34 years (interquartile range, 30). Median time from injury to admission and admission to successful AO were 31 versus 11 minutes, respectively. Patients who died had shorter median times from injury to successful AO (44 vs. 72 minutes, P &lt; 0.001) and admission to successful AO (10 vs. 22 minutes, P &lt; 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that receiving RT was the strongest predictor of mortality (odds ratio [OR], 6.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.4-9.9; P &lt; 0.001). Time from injury to admission and admission to successful AO were not significant. This finding was consistent in subgroup analysis of RT-only and REBOA-only populations. Conclusions: Despite expedited interventions, time to aortic occlusion did not significantly impact mortality. This may suggest that rapid in-hospital intervention was often insufficient to compensate for severe exsanguination and hypovolemia that had already occurred before emergency department presentation. Selective prehospital advanced resuscitative care closer to the point of injury with \"scoop and control\" efforts including hemostatic resuscitation warrants special consideration."

    "abstract": "Little is known about the impact of multimorbidity on long-term outcomes for older emergency general surgery patients. Medicare beneficiaries, age 65 and older, who underwent operative management of an emergency general surgery condition were identified using Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid claims data. Patients were classified as multimorbid based on the presence of a Qualifying Comorbidity Set (a specific combination of comorbid conditions known to be associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality in the general surgery setting) and compared with those without multimorbidity. Risk-adjusted outcomes through 180 days after discharge from index hospitalization were calculated using linear and logistic regressions. Of 174,891 included patients, 45.5% were identified as multimorbid. Multimorbid patients had higher rates of mortality during index hospitalization (5.9% vs 0.7%, odds ratio [OR] 3.05, p &lt; 0.001) and through 6 months (17.1% vs 3.4%, OR 2.33, p &lt; 0.001) after discharge.

Older, multimorbid patients experience worse outcomes, including survival and independent function, after emergency general surgery than nonmultimorbid patients through 6 months after discharge from index hospitalization. This information is important for setting recovery expectations for high-risk patients to improve shared decision-making."

    "abstract": "Ongoing efforts to promote quality-improvement in emergency general surgery (EGS) have made substantial strides but lack clear definitions of what constitutes \"high-quality\" EGS care. To address this concern, we developed a novel set of five non-mortality-based quality metrics broadly applicable to the care of all EGS patients and sought to discern whether (1) they can be used to identify groups of best-performing EGS hospitals, (2) results are similar for simple versus complex EGS severity in both adult (18-64 years) and older adult (≥65 years) populations, and (3) best performance is associated with differences in hospital-level factors. Patients hospitalized with 1-of-16 American Association for the Surgery of Trauma-defined EGS conditions were identified in the 2019 Nationwide Readmissions Database. They were stratified by age/severity into four cohorts: simple adults, complex adults, simple older adults, complex older adults. Within each cohort, risk-adjusted hierarchical models were used to calculate condition-specific risk-standardized quality metrics. K-means cluster analysis identified hospitals with similar performance, and multinomial regression identified predictors of resultant \"best/average/worst\" EGS care. A total of 1,130,496 admissions from 984 hospitals were included (40.6% simple adults, 13.5% complex adults, 39.5% simple older adults, and 6.4% complex older adults). Within each cohort, K-means cluster analysis identified three groups (\"best/average/worst\"). Cluster assignment was highly conserved with 95.3% of hospitals assigned to the same cluster in each cohort. It was associated with consistently best/average/worst performance across differences in outcomes (5×) and EGS conditions (16×). When examined for associations with hospital-level factors, best-performing hospitals were those with the largest EGS volume, greatest extent of patient frailty, and most complicated underlying patient case-mix. Use of non-mortality-based quality metrics appears to offer a needed promising means of evaluating high-quality EGS care. The results underscore the importance of accounting for outcomes applicable to all EGS patients when designing quality-improvement initiatives and suggest that, given the consistency of best-performing hospitals, natural EGS centers-of-excellence could exist.

    "abstract": "Surgical resident operative autonomy has decreased markedly over time, reducing resident readiness for independent practice. We sought to examine operative resident autonomy for emergency acute care surgery (ACS) compared to elective cases and associated patient outcomes at veterans affairs hospitals. The Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried for ACS cases (emergency general, vascular, and thoracic) at veterans affairs hospitals from 2004 to 2019. Cases are coded prospectively for the level of supervision: attending primary surgeon (AP); attending scrubbed with resident surgeon (AR); resident primary (RP), attending not scrubbed. Baseline demographics, operative variables, and outcomes were compared. A total of 61,275 ACS cases and 605,146 elective cases were performed during the study period. The ACS had a higher proportion of RP cases (7.2% versus 5.7%, P < 0.001). The proportion of ACS RP cases decreased from 9.9% to 4.1% (58.6%); elective RP cases decreased from 8.9% to 2.9% (67.4%). The most common ACS RP surgeries were appendectomy, amputations, and cholecystectomy. RP cases had lower American Society of Anesthesia class and lower median work relative value units than AP and AR. There was no difference between mortality rates of RP compared to AP (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.94 [0.80-1.09] or AR 0.94 [0.81-1.08]). While there was no difference in complications between the RP and AP (OR 1.01 [0.92-1.12]), there were significantly more complications in AR compared to RP (OR 1.20 [1.10-1.31]). More autonomy is granted for ACS cases compared to elective cases. While both decreased over time, the decrease is less for ACS cases. Resident autonomy does not negatively impact outcomes, even in emergent cases."

Unnecessary use of resources occurs with current practice. We aimed to demonstrate the feasibility and acceptance of a teletrauma surgery consultation service between LITC and RCH. LITC TACS surgeons provided telehealth consults on trauma patients from 3 local RCHs. After consultation, appropriate patients were transferred to LITC; selected patients remained at or were discharged from RCH. Participating TACS surgeons and RCH physicians were surveyed. A total of 28 patients met inclusion criteria during the 5-month pilot phase, with 7 excluded due to workflow issues. The mean ± SD age was 63 ± 17 years. Of 21 patients, 7 had intracranial hemorrhage; 12 had rib fractures. The mean ± SD Injury Severity Score was 8.1 ± 4.0). A total of 6 patients were discharged from RCH, 4 admitted to RCH hospitalist service, 2 transferred to a LITC emergency room, and 9 transferred to LITC as direct admission. There was one 30-day readmission and no missed injuries or complications, or deaths. RCH providers were highly satisfied with the teletrauma surgery consultation service, TACS surgeons, and equipment used. Mental demand and effort of consulting TACS surgeons decreased significantly as the consult number increased. Teletrauma surgery consultation involving 3 RCH within our system is feasible and acceptable. A total of 10 transfers and 19 emergency department visits were avoided. There was favorable acceptance by RCH providers and TACS surgeons."

This was a retrospective cohort study that took place at US hospitals with an emergency department and used a computational generalization of inverse propensity score weight to create patient populations with similar covariate distributions. Participants were Medicare patients age 65.5 years or older admitted from the emergency department for an emergency general surgery condition between July 1, 2015, and June 30, 2018.

Additionally, when restricting the analysis to Black patients and White patients who were treated in the same hospitals, Black patients had 8% lower odds of receiving a surgical consultation when compared with White patients (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.90-0.93) with a risk difference of -1.82 (95% CI, -2.18 to -1.46). In this study, Black Medicare patients had lower odds of receiving a surgical consultation after being admitted from the emergency department with an emergency general surgery condition when compared with similar White Medicare patients. These disparities in consultation rates cannot be fully attributed to medical comorbidities, insurance status, socioeconomic factors, or individual hospital-level effects."

We set out to determine risk factors associated with EGS procedure-related 30-day unplanned readmissions. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project database (2013-2019). It included nine surgical procedures encompassing 80% of the burden of EGS diseases, performed on an urgent/emergent basis. The procedures were classified as low risk (open and laparoscopic appendectomy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy) and high risk (open cholecystectomy, laparoscopic and open colectomy, lysis of adhesions, perforated ulcer repair, small bowel resection, and exploratory laparotomy). Data on patient characteristics, admission status, procedure risk, hospital length of stay, and discharge disposition were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. A total of 312,862 patients were included (16,306 procedure-related 30-day readmissions [5.2%]). Thirty-day readmission patients were older, had higher American Association of Anesthesiology scores, were more often underweighted or markedly obese, and were more frequently presented with sepsis. Risk factors associated with EGS procedure-related 30-day unplanned readmissions included age older than 40 years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.15), American Association of Anesthesiology ≥3 (AOR, 1.41), sepsis present at the time of surgery (AOR, 1.84), body mass index <18 kg/m 2 (AOR, 1.16), body mass index ≥40 kg/m 2 (AOR, 1.12), high-risk procedures (AOR, 1.51), LOS ≥4 d (AOR, 2.04), and discharge except to home (AOR, 1.33). Thirty-day readmissions following low-risk procedures occurred at a median of 5 days (interquartile range, 2-11 days) and 6 days (interquartile range, 3-11 days) after high-risk procedures. Surgical site infections, postoperative sepsis, wound disruption, and thromboembolic events were more prevalent in the 30-day readmission group. Mortality rate was fourfold higher in the 30-day readmission group (2.4% vs. 0.6%). We identified several unmodifiable patients and EGS disease-related factors associated with 30-day unplanned readmissions. Readmissions could be potentially reduced by the implementation of a postdischarge surveillance systems between hospitals and postdischarge destination facilities, leveraging telehealth and outpatient care.

A retrospective review of patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis during 2017-2018. ACS and TRAD-patient demographics, clinical presentation, operative details, and outcomes were compared using independent sample t-tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and Fisher's exact or χ2 tests. Multiple exploratory regression models were constructed to examine the effects of confounding variables. Demographics, clinical presentation, and complication rates were similar between groups except for a longer duration of symptoms prior to arrival in the TRAD group (Δ = 0.5 d, P = 0.006). Time from admission to operating room (Δ = -1.85 h, P = 0.003), length of hospital stay (Δ = -2.0 d, P < 0.001), and total cost (Δ = $ -2477.02, P < 0.001) were significantly lower in the ACS group compared to the TRAD group. Furthermore, perforation rates were lower in ACS (8.3% versus 28.6%, P = 0.003). Differences for the outcomes remained significant even after controlling for duration of symptoms prior to arrival (P < 0.05). Acute appendicitis managed using the ACS shift-based model seems to be associated with reduced time to operation, hospital stay, and overall cost, with equivalent success rates, compared to TRAD."

We sought to determine whether fast-tracking patients undergoing nonelective LC is safe and feasible. We performed a retrospective cohort review of 661 consecutive patients undergoing LC at a single teaching institution from April 2018 to January 2020. Subjects were divided into two groups: elective LC (ELC) and fast-track nonelective LC (FTLC). FTLC was defined as nonelective LC with total length of stay <36 h. Patients undergoing nonelective LC with length of stay exceeding 36 h were excluded. The primary outcome of interest was readmission within 30 d. The secondary outcomes included incidences of return to emergency department within 30 d, retained stone, bile leak, and wound infection. Of 661 LC, 185 (27%) were ELC and 476 (72%) were nonelective. FTLC included 121 (25%) of the nonelective LC. Preoperative characteristics were similar among the groups. On final pathology, chronic cholecystitis was predominant in both groups, but FTLC exhibited higher rates of acute cholecystitis (P < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in the primary outcome among groups: readmission within 30 d occurred in 6 (3%) ELC patients and 4 (3%) FTLC patients (P = 1.0). There were no significant differences in rates of return to emergency department within 30 d, retained stone, bile leak, or wound infection. With comparable postoperative complication rates to ELC, FTLC can be safely used in select patients. Additional studies are needed to determine preoperative predictors of FTLC suitability to prospectively identify appropriate patients."

To evaluate our programs' efficacy, we investigated cholecystectomies as a common urgent procedure representative of services provided. We hypothesized that the adoption of a TACS service would result in improved access to care as evidence by decreased ER visits prior to cholecystectomy, improved time to cholecystectomy, and decreased hospital length of stay (LOS). All patients that underwent urgent cholecystectomy from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 were reviewed. The unencumbered TACS surgeon was implemented on July 1, 2018. Prior ER visits involving biliary symptoms, time from admission to cholecystectomy, and hospital LOS were compared. Of the 322 urgent cholecystectomies over the study period, 165 were performed prior and 157 following adoption of the TACS structure. The average number of ER visits for biliary symptoms prior to cholecystectomy decreased from 1.4 to 1.2 (p = 0.01). Time from admission to cholecystectomy was 28.3 hours and 27.3 hours respectively (p = 0.74). Average LOS decreased following the restructure (3.1 vs 2.5 days; p = 0.03). Implementation of an unencumbered TACS surgeon managing urgent surgical disease improves access to and delivery of surgical services for cholecystectomy patients in a safety net, level one trauma center. Further research is necessary to determine potential improvements in hospital cost and patient satisfaction."

Laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) has shown advantages in terms of clinical results and cost-effectiveness, even if there is still controversy about different devices to utilize, especially with regards to the endoloop (EL) vs endostapler (ES) when it comes to stump closure. To compare safety and cost-effectiveness of EL vs ES. From a prospectively maintained database, data of 996 consecutive patients treated by LA with a 3 years-follow up in the department of Emergency General Surgery - St Orsola University Hospital, Bologna (Italy) were retrieved. A meta-analysis was performed in terms of surgical complications, in comparison to the international literature published from 1995 to 2021. The meta-analysis showed no evidence regarding wound infections, abdominal abscesses, and total post-operative complications, in terms of superiority of a surgical technique for the stump closure in LA. Even when AA is complicated, the routine use of EL is safe in most patients."

    "abstract": "Introduction  Numerous scoring systems have been created to predict the risk of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing emergency general surgery (EGS). In this article, we compared the different scoring systems utilized at Humanitas Research Hospital and analyzed which one performed the best when assessing geriatric patients (>65 years of age). The scoring systems that were utilized were the APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II), ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists), ACS-NSQIP (American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program), Clinical Frailty Score, and the Clavien-Dindo classification as control. Materials and Methods  We compiled a database consisting of all patients over the age of 65 who underwent EGS in a consecutive 24-month period between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2018. We used the biostatistical program \"Stata Version 15\" to analyze our results. Results  We found 213 patients who matched our inclusion criteria. Regarding death, we found that the ACS-NSQIP death calculator performed the best with an area under the curve of 0.9017 (odds ratio: 1.09; 95% confidence interval: 1.06-1.12). The APACHE II score had the lowest discriminator when predicting death. Considering short-term complications, the Clavien-Dindo classification scored highly, while both the APACHE II score and Clinical Frailty Score produced the lowest results. Conclusion  The results obtained from our research showed that scoring systems and classifications produced different results depending on whether they were used to predict deaths or short-term complications among geriatric patients undergoing EGS."

    "title": "Communication During Interhospital Transfers of Emergency General Surgery Patients: A Qualitative Study of Challenges and Opportunities.",
    "abstract": "Transferred emergency general surgery (EGS) patients experience worse outcomes than directly admitted patients. Improving communication during transfers may improve patient care. We sought to understand the nature of and challenges to communication between referring (RP) and accepting (AP) providers transferring EGS patients from the transfer center nurse's (TCN) perspective. Guided by the Relational Coordination Framework, we interviewed 17 TCNs at an academic medical center regarding (in)efficient and (in)effective communication between RPs and APs. In-person interviews were recorded, transcribed, and managed in NVivo. Four researchers developed a codebook, cocoded transcripts, and met regularly to build consensus and discuss emergent themes. We used data matrices to perform constant comparisons and arrive at higher-level concepts. Challenges to ideal communication centered on the appropriateness and completeness of information, efficiency of the conversation, and degree of consensus. Transfer center nurses described that RPs provided incomplete information because of a lack of necessary infrastructure, personnel, or technical knowledge; competing clinical demands; or a fear of the transfer request being rejected. Inefficient communication resulted from RPs being unfamiliar with the information APs expected and the lack of a structured process to share information. Communication also failed when providers disagreed about the necessity of the transfer. Accepting providers diffused tension and facilitated communication by embracing the role of a \"coach,\" negotiating \"wait-and-see\" agreements, and providing explanations of why transfers were unnecessary. Transfer center nurses described numerous challenges to provider communication. Opportunities for improvement include sharing appropriate and complete information, ensuring efficient communication, and reaching consensus about the course of action."

    "abstract": "Hospitalizations in emergency general surgery (EGS) cases in the USA have increased by 28% since 2001. The costs of these cases are estimated to increase by 45% annually until 2060, reaching 41.20 billion dollars. According to the literature, the general surgery clinic team allocates an average of 5.5 hours a day for emergency room consultations. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of consultations from the emergency room in our country on the EGS approach and to create appropriate solution proposals with the data obtained from the regional hospitals. The source of the data in our study is the number of EGS cases presented by 10 regional hospitals at the Central Anatolia regional meetings of The Turkish Association of Trauma and Emergency Surgery between 2017 and 2020. MATLAB R2021b (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, USA) and SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 22.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) programs were used for data analysis and graphics creation. The hospitalization/consultation rate was evaluated as the success of the doctors working at the emergency department in recognizing EGS cases; the average value was 20.15% across all hospitals. The surgery/emergency hospitalization rate, which shows rate of the hospitalized patients underwent surgery, is 59.17% when all centers are taken into account. The rate of surgery/admission in acute cholecystitis cases is 31.49% for all centers. It is seen that the hospitalization/consultation rate decreases with the increase in hospital workload. The rate of laparoscopic/total appendectomy is 22.78% across all centers. There is a correlation between acute appendicitis cases and EGS consultation numbers, but there is no correlation between laparoscopic appendectomy and consultation numbers. In addition, it is seen that medical follow-up is preferred in acute cholecystitis cases in centers where the consultation burden is increased; cholecystectomy is preferred at a higher rate in centers where the consultation burden is less. National EGS systems are needed and tried to be developed in order to improve the approach and outcomes of EGS patients worldwide. It is considered essential to establish a national EGS maintenance system that coordinates country resources and optimizes outcomes."

One rare complication is enteroliths forming in the diverticula causing bowel obstruction. Only a few cases of such have been described in literature, and recurrence from this aetiology has not been reported previously. This case report outlines the management of a 68-year-old male who presented with recurrent small bowel obstruction secondary to jejunal diverticular enterolith impaction, seven months following a previous episode. A 68-year-old male presented with symptoms of small bowel obstruction. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen demonstrated small bowel obstruction from an enterolith formed in one of his extensive jejunal diverticula. He required a laparotomy, an enterotomy proximal to the enterolith, removal of the enterolith, closure of the enterotomy, and resection of a segment of perforated ileum with stapled side-to-side anastomosis. Seven months later, he represented to emergency department with similar symptoms. Another CT scan of his abdomen revealed a recurrent small bowel obstruction secondary to enterolith impaction. He underwent another laparotomy in which it was evident that a large enterolith was impacted at the afferent limb of the previous small bowel anastomosis. A part of the anastomosis was excised to allow removal of the enterolith and the defect was closed with cutting linear stapler. In the following two years, the patient did not have a recurrent episode of enterolith-related bowel obstruction. The pathophysiology underlying enterolith formation is unclear, so it is difficult to predict if or when enteroliths may form and cause bowel obstruction. More research could provide advice to prevent recurrent enterolith formation and its sequelae."

    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: The pandemic of SARS-CoV-19 has affected the overall spectrum of General Surgery, either in the case management part, or in the type of cases. The purpose of this review is to gather all the parameters affected and to compare these changes between the pandemic period and the corresponding time frame of the previous year. Materials and Methods: A review of literature in two electronic databases (PubMed and Scopus) was performed examining studies during the pre-pandemic (March to May 2019) and pandemic (March to May 2020) period about emergency surgeries. The differences in case presentation in emergency rooms, patient characteristics, length of hospitalization, type of surgery, complications and mortality rate were compared. Results: The comparison of the studies revealed significant results highlighting the differences between the two time periods for each parameter. There has been observed an overall decrease in the number of cases presented for emergency and urgent surgery. In terms of age, sex, and BMI, there were no significant variations amongst the patients. About the length of hospitalization, the patients hospitalized longer during the pandemic period. In terms of pathologies, the most common types of surgery were appendectomy, gastrointestinal, and colorectal resection. Mortality did not differ between the two study periods. Conclusions: COVID-19 affected a large part of Emergency General Surgery mainly concerns the type of operations performed. The hospitalization of patients, the complications that may have arisen and the recognition of emergencies were the most important issues faced by health care officials in hospitals during the period of COVID-19; however, there were parameters like mortality and patients' characteristics that did not appear to differ with pre-pandemic era."

    "abstract": "Background. Antibiotic treatment in emergency general surgery (EGS) is a major challenge for surgeons, and a multidisciplinary approach is necessary in order to improve outcomes. Intra-abdominal infections are at high risk of increased morbidity and mortality, and prolonged hospitalization. An increase in multi-drug resistance bacterial infections and a tendency to an antibiotic overuse has been described in surgical settings. In this clinical scenario, antibiotic de-escalation (ADE) is emerging as a strategy to improve the management of antibiotic therapy. The objective of this article is to summarize the available evidence, current strategies and unsolved problems for the optimization of ADE in EGS. Methods. A literature search was performed on PubMed and Cochrane using \"de-escalation\", \"antibiotic therapy\" and \"antibiotic treatment\" as research terms. Results. There is no universally accepted definition for ADE. Current evidence shows that ADE is a feasible strategy in the EGS setting, with the ability to optimize antibiotic use, to reduce hospitalization and health care costs, without compromising clinical outcome. Many studies focus on Intensive Care Unit patients, and a call for further studies is required in the EGS community. Current guidelines already recommend ADE when surgery for uncomplicated appendicitis and cholecystitis reaches a complete source control. Conclusions. ADE in an effective and feasible strategy in EGS patients, in order to optimize antibiotic management without compromising clinical outcomes. A collaborative effort between surgeons, intensivists and infectious disease specialists is mandatory. There is a strong need for further studies selectively focusing in the EGS ward setting."

    "abstract": "To compare predictive accuracy of frailty instruments operationalizable in electronic data for prognosticating outcomes among older adults undergoing emergency general surgery (EGS). Older patients undergoing EGS are at higher risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality. Preoperative frailty is a common and strong perioperative risk factor in this population. Despite this, existing barriers preclude routine preoperative frailty assessment. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults above 65 undergoing EGS from 2012 to 2018 using Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) provincial healthcare data in Ontario, Canada. We compared 4 frailty instruments: Frailty Index (FI), Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS), Risk Analysis Index-Administrative (RAI), ACG Frailty-defining diagnoses indicator (ACG). We compared predictive accuracy beyond baseline risk models (age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists' score, procedural risk). Predictive performance was measured using discrimination, calibration, explained variance, net reclassification index and Brier score (binary outcomes); using explained variance, root mean squared error and mean absolute prediction error (continuous outcomes). Primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were 365-day mortality, nonhome discharge, days alive at home, length of stay, and 30-day and 365-day health systems cost. A total of 121,095 EGS patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 11,422 (9.4%) experienced death 30 days postoperatively. Addition of FI, HFRS, and RAI to the baseline model led to improved discrimination, net reclassification index, and R2 ; RAI demonstrated the largest improvements. Adding 4 frailty instruments to typically assessed preoperative risk factors demonstrated strong predictive performance in accurately prognosticating perioperative outcomes. These findings can be considered in developing automated risk stratification systems among older EGS patients."

    "abstract": "Non-traumatic emergency general surgery involves a heterogeneous population that may present with several underlying diseases. Timeous emergency surgical treatment should be supplemented with high-quality perioperative care, ideally performed by multidisciplinary teams trained to identify and handle complex postoperative courses. Uncontrolled or poorly controlled acute postoperative pain may result in significant complications. While pain management after elective surgery has been standardized in perioperative pathways, the traditional perioperative treatment of patients undergoing emergency surgery is often a haphazard practice. The present recommended pain management guidelines are for pain management after non-traumatic emergency surgical intervention. It is meant to provide clinicians a list of indications to prescribe the optimal analgesics even in the absence of a multidisciplinary pain team. An international expert panel discussed the different issues in subsequent rounds. Four international recognized scientific societies: World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES), Global Alliance for Infection in Surgery (GAIS), Italian Society of Anesthesia, Analgesia Intensive Care (SIAARTI), and American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST), endorsed the project and approved the final manuscript. Dealing with acute postoperative pain in the emergency abdominal surgery setting is complex, requires special attention, and should be multidisciplinary. Several tools are available, and their combination is mandatory whenever is possible. Analgesic approach to the various situations and conditions should be patient based and tailored according to procedure, pathology, age, response, and available expertise. A better understanding of the patho-mechanisms of postoperative pain for short- and long-term outcomes is necessary to improve prophylactic and treatment strategies."

However, this has not been adequately investigated at a population level. We characterized the incidence and mortality of EGS conditions among SOTRs compared with nontransplant patients. Data were collected through linked administrative population-based databases in Ontario, Canada. We included all adult SOTRs (kidney, liver, heart, and lung) who underwent transplantation between 2002 and 2017. We then identified posttransplantation emergency department visits for EGS conditions (appendicitis, cholecystitis, choledocolithiasis, perforated diverticulitis, incarcerated/strangulated hernias, small bowel obstruction, and perforated peptic ulcer). Age-, sex-, and year-standardized incidence rate ratios (SIRRs) were generated. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate association between transplantation status and 30 d mortality after adjusting for demographics, year, and comorbidities. Ten thousand seventy-three SOTRs and 12 608 135 persons were analyzed. SOTRs developed 881 EGS conditions (non-SOTRs: 552 194 events). The incidence of all EGS conditions among SOTR was significantly higher compared with the nontransplant patients [SIRR 3.56 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.32-3.82)], even among those with high Aggregated Diagnosis Groups scores ( > 10) [SIRR 2.76 (95% CI 2.53-3.00)]. SOTRs were 1.4 times more likely to die at 30 d [adjusted odds ratio 1.44 (95% CI 1.08-1.91)] after an EGS event compared with nontransplant patients, predominantly amongst lung transplant recipients [adjusted odds ratio 3.28 (95% CI 1.72-6.24)]. The incidence of EGS conditions is significantly higher in SOTRs even after stratifying by comorbidity burden. This is of particular importance as SOTRs also have a higher likelihood of death after an EGS condition, especially lung transplant recipients."

    "abstract": "Emergency laparotomy cases account for a significant proportion of the surgical caseload requiring postoperative intensive care. However, access to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) services has been limited by the scarcity of resources, lack of guidelines, and paucity of triaging tools. This study aimed at developing a feasible Post-emergency laparotomy ICU admission Predictive (PIP) scoring tool. A case-control study utilizing the records of 108 patients who underwent emergency laparotomy was conducted. The primary outcome was the postoperative disposition status. Cases were defined as emergency laparotomy patients admitted to the ICU. The control group constituted patients admitted to the general ward. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the perioperative predictors of outcome. The PIP score was developed as a composite of each statistically significant variable remaining in the final logistic regression model. The significant positive predictors of ICU admission included a worsening American Society of Anesthesiologists - Physical Status, decreasing preoperative baseline axillary temperature, increasing preoperative baseline pulse rate, and intraoperative blood-product transfusion. The scoring system incorporating the identified predictors was presented as a numeric scale ranging from zero to four. Two levels of prediction were defined with reference to the optimum cut-off value; a score of <3 (low-intermediate prediction) and a score of ≥3 (high prediction [OR = 37.00, 95% CI = 11.22-122.02, p <0.001]). The score demonstrated an excellent predictive ability on the Receiver Operator Characteristic Curve (Area Under the Curve = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.851-0.973, p <0.001). The PIP score proves useful as a feasible postoperative triaging adjunct for emergency laparotomy cases. Nonetheless, further validation studies are required."

DPR is performed following damage control surgery by leaving a surgical drain in the mesentery, placing a temporary abdominal closure, and postoperatively running peritoneal dialysis solution through the surgical drain with removal through the temporary closure. In the original animal models, the peritoneal dialysate infusion was found to augment visceral microcirculatory blood flow reducing the ischemic insult that occurs following hemorrhagic shock. DPR was also found to minimize the aberrant immune response that occurs secondary to shock and contributes to multisystem organ dysfunction. In the subsequent human trials, performing DPR had significant effects in several key categories. Traumatically injured patients who received DPR had a significantly shorter time to definitive fascial closure, had a higher likelihood of achieving primary fascial closure, and experienced fewer abdominal complications. The use of DPR has been further expanded as a useful adjunct for emergency general surgery patients and in the pretransplant care of human cadaver organ donors."

We aimed to study changes in FTR following emergency surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Matched cohort study including all COVID-19-non-infected adult patients undergoing emergency general surgery in 25 Spanish hospitals during COVID-19 pandemic peak (March-April 2020), non-peak (May-June 2020), and 2019 control periods. A propensity score-matched comparative analysis was conducted using a logistic regression model, in which period was regressed on observed baseline characteristics. Subsequently, a mixed effects logistic regression model was constructed for each variable of interest. Main variable was FTR. Secondary variables were post-operative complications, readmissions, reinterventions, and length of stay. 5003 patients were included (948, 1108, and 2947 in the pandemic peak, non-peak, and control periods), with comparable clinical characteristics, prognostic scores, complications, reintervention, rehospitalization rates, and length of stay across periods. FTR was greater during the pandemic peak than during non-peak and pre-pandemic periods (22.5% vs. 17.2% and 12.7%), being this difference confirmed in adjusted analysis (odds ratio [OR] 2.13, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.27-3.66). There was sensible inter-hospital variability in FTR changes during the pandemic peak (median FTR change +8.77%, IQR 0-29.17%) not observed during the pandemic non-peak period (median FTR change 0%, IQR -6.01-6.72%). Greater FTR increase was associated with higher COVID-19 incidence (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.31-4.16) and some hospital characteristics, including tertiary level (OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.27-8.00), medium-volume (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.14-7.34), and high basal-adjusted complication risk (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.07-4.72). FTR following emergency surgery experienced a heterogeneous increase during different periods of the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting it to behave as an indicator of hospital resilience.

Patterns of presentation have changed and management pathways have also been adapted, moving to more non-operative management (NOM) for some conditions. We investigated how COVID-19 changed the volume of emergency general surgery operating in our district general hospital (DGH). We aimed to evaluate the impact of NOM on outcomes in acute appendicitis. A retrospective case review of operating lists, patient handover lists, and patient notes was undertaken for patients presented between 1st January 2020 and 3rd June 2020. The study period was divided into two, with the period between 1st January 2020 and 23rd March 2020 representing the pre-COVID cohort. Some 393 emergency general surgery operations were performed in the study period. There was a clear reduction in operating volume after 23rd March 2020. During that same period, 325 patients were assessed with right iliac fossa (RIF) pain. Median age was 21 (range 5-87) and 201 patients were female (61.8%). The rate of NOM for suspected acute appendicitis was 8.8% in the pre-COVID group, which increased to 36.4% in the COVID group. The incidence of normal histology following appendicectomy did not change with this difference in management (16.1% compared to 17.9%, p = 0.78). This study summarizes the changes brought to the provision of emergency general surgery in the setting of a DGH by the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, NOM was the preferred option for acute appendicitis but this did not alter the negative appendicectomy rate."

This study aims to evaluate the short-term outcomes for non-elective robotic colectomies for diverticulitis. All colectomies for diverticulitis in ACS-NSQIP between 2012 and 2019 were identified by CPT and diagnosis codes. Open and elective cases were excluded. Patients with disseminated cancer, ascites, and ventilator-dependence were excluded. Procedures were grouped by approach (laparoscopic and robotic). Demographics, operative variables, and postoperative outcomes were compared between groups. Covariates with p < .1 were entered into multivariable logistic regression models for 30 day mortality, postoperative septic shock and reoperation. 6880 colectomies were evaluated (Laparoscopic = 6583, Robotic = 297). The laparoscopic group included more preoperative sepsis (31.6% vs. 10.8%), emergency cases (32.3% vs. 6.7%), and grade 3/4 wound classifications (53.3% vs. 42.8%). There was no difference in mortality, anastomotic leak, SSI, reoperation, readmission, or length of stay. The laparoscopic group had more postoperative sepsis (p = 0.001) and the robotic group showed increased bleeding (p = 0.011).

In people with critical illness before surgery, few data describe patient-centred outcomes. Our objective was to estimate the association of frailty with postoperative days alive at home in older critically ill patients requiring emergency general surgery. A retrospective population-based cohort study was conducted using linked administrative health data in Ontario, Canada from 2009 to 2019. All individuals aged ≥66 yr with an ICU admission before emergency general surgery were included. We compared the count of days alive at home at 30 and 365 days after surgery based on frailty status using a validated, multidimensional index. Unadjusted and multilevel, multivariable adjusted effect estimates were calculated. A sensitivity analysis based on early recovery category was performed. We identified 7003 eligible patients; 2063 (29.5%) lived with frailty. At 30 days, mean days alive at home with frailty were 4.5 (standard deviation 8.2) and 7.6 (standard deviation 10.2) in those without frailty. In adjusted analysis, frailty was associated with fewer days alive at home at 30 (ratio of means [RoM] 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.60-0.78; P<0.001) and 365 days (RoM 0.72; 95% CI: 0.64-0.82; P<0.001). Individuals with frailty had a higher probability of poor recovery status, with effects increasing across the first postoperative month. In patients with critical illness requiring emergency general surgery, frailty is associated with fewer days alive at home. This information should be discussed with critically ill patients before emergent surgical intervention to better inform decision-making."

    "title": "The physiology of failure: Identifying risk factors for mortality in emergency general surgery patients using a regional health system integrated electronic medical record.",
    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) patients have increased mortality risk compared with elective counterparts. Recent studies on risk factors have largely used national data sets limited to administrative data. Our aim was to examine risk factors in an integrated regional health system EGS database, including clinical and administrative data, hypothesizing that this novel process would identify clinical variables as important risk factors for mortality. Our nine-hospital health system's billing data were queried for EGS International Classification of Disease codes between 2013 and 2018. Codes were grouped by diagnosis, and urgent or emergent encounters were included and merged with electronic medical record clinical data. Outcomes assessed were inpatient and 1-year mortality. Standard and multivariable statistics evaluated factors associated with mortality. There were 253,331 EGS admissions with 3.6% inpatient mortality rate. Patients who suffered inpatient and 1-year mortality were older, more likely to be underweight, and have neutropenia or elevated lactate. On multivariable analysis for inpatient mortality: age (odds ratio [OR], 1.7-6.7), underweight body mass index (OR, 1.6), transfer admission (OR, 1.8), leukopenia (OR, 2.0), elevated lactate (OR, 1.8), and ventilator requirement (OR, 7.1) remained associated with increased risk. Adjusted analysis for 1-year mortality demonstrated similar findings, with highest risk associated with older age (OR, 2.8-14.6), underweight body mass index (OR, 2.3), neutropenia (OR, 2.0), and tachycardia (OR, 1.7). After controlling for patient and disease characteristics available in administrative databases, clinical variables remained significantly associated with mortality. This novel yet simple process allows for easy identification of clinical data points imperative to the study of EGS diagnoses that are critical in understanding factors that impact mortality.

    "title": "Use of a New Prevention Model in Acute Care Surgery: A Population Approach to Preventing Emergency Surgical Morbidity and Mortality.",
    "abstract": "Whether patients undergo the more morbid and costly emergent rather than an elective type of surgery, may depend on many factors. Since tertiary prevention (preventing poor outcomes from emergency surgery) carries a much higher mortality than secondary prevention (preventing emergency surgery) or primary prevention (preventing the disease requiring surgery), the overall United States mortality might be reduced significantly, if emergency surgery could be avoided via high-quality primary prevention and non-surgical therapy or increasing elective surgery at the expense of emergency procedures, e.g., secondary prevention. The practice and study of acute care surgery then has the potential to broaden from a focus on the patient in the hospital emergency and operating rooms to the patient who no longer requires either, whose disease is treated or prevented in his/her/their community."

    "abstract": "Treatment delays are associated with increased morbidity and cost of disease, although the extent to which cost sharing influences timely presentation and management of acute surgical disease remains unknown. Given recent policy changes using cost sharing to modify health care behavior, this study examines the association of cost sharing with the health of the patient at presentation and with receipt of optimal or minimally invasive surgery. To assess whether cost sharing is associated with the likelihood of early, uncomplicated patient presentation or with surgical management of 2 representative emergency general surgery diagnoses: acute appendicitis and acute diverticulitis. This cohort study used Health Care Cost Institute claims from January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2017, to analyze data of commercially insured individuals hospitalized for acute appendicitis or diverticulitis. In total, 151 852 patients in the data set aged 18 to 64 years and presenting with acute appendicitis or diverticulitis were included as identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision. Data were analyzed from January 2020 through February 2021. The primary exposure was patient total cost sharing incurred for the index hospitalization, defined as their summed deductible, copayments, and coinsurance. The primary outcome was early, uncomplicated disease presentation. Secondary outcomes were receipt of optimal surgical care and minimally invasive surgery if undergoing an operation. Analyses were conducted with multivariable logistic regression models to adjust for patient characteristics and community-level socioeconomic and geographic factors. High cost sharing was defined as quartile 4 (>$3082), and low cost sharing as quartile 1 ($0-$502). Among 151 852 patients, 52.4% were men, and the total cost-sharing median was $1725 (interquartile range, $503-$3082). Higher cost sharing was associated with lower odds of early, uncomplicated disease presentation (odds ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.61-0.65). Patients with higher cost sharing were less likely to receive optimal surgical care (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-0.99) or minimally invasive surgery (odds ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84-0.95). The findings of this cohort study suggest that, as policymakers debate the degree of cost sharing in public and private insurance plans, attention should be given to the clinical and financial implications associated with care delays."

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has brought many challenges including barriers to delivering high-quality surgical care and follow-up while minimizing the risk of infection. Telehealth has been increasingly utilized for post-operative visits, yet little data exists to guide surgeons in its use. We sought to determine safety and efficacy of telehealth follow-up in patients undergoing cholecystectomy during the global pandemic at a VA Medical Center (VAMC). This was a retrospective review of patients undergoing cholecystectomy at a level 1A VAMC over a 2-year period from August 2019 to August 2021. Baseline demographics, post-operative complications, readmissions, emergency department (ED) visits and need for additional procedures were reviewed. Patients who experienced a complication prior to discharge, underwent a concomitant procedure, had non-absorbable skin closure, had new diagnosis of malignancy or were discharged home with drain(s) were ineligible for telehealth follow-up and excluded. Over the study period, 179 patients underwent cholecystectomy; 30 (17%) were excluded as above. 20 (13%) missed their follow-up, 52 (35%) were seen via telehealth and 77 (52%) followed-up in person. There was no difference between the two groups regarding baseline demographics or intra-operative variables. There was no significant difference in post-operative complications [4 (8%) vs 6 (8%), p > 0.99], ED utilization [5 (10%) vs 7 (9%), p = 0.78], 30-day readmission [3 (6%) vs 6 (8%), p = 0.74] or need for additional procedures [2 (4%) vs 4 (5%), p = 0.41] between telehealth and in-person follow-up. Telehealth follow-up after cholecystectomy is safe and effective in Veterans. There were no differences in outcomes between patients that followed up in-person vs those that were seen via phone or video. Routine telehealth follow-up after uncomplicated cholecystectomy should be considered for all patients."

    "abstract": "Initially used in trauma management, delayed abdominal closure endeavors to decrease operative time during the index operation while still being lifesaving. Its use in emergency general surgery is increasing, but the data evaluating its outcome are sparse. We aimed to study the association between delayed abdominal closure, mortality, morbidity, and length of stay in an emergency surgery cohort. The 2013 to 2017 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was examined for patients undergoing emergency laparotomy. The patients were classified by the timing of abdominal wall closure: delayed fascial closure versus immediate fascial closure. Propensity score matching was performed based on preoperative covariates, wound classification, and performance of bowel resection. The outcomes were then compared by univariable analysis. After matching, both the delayed fascial closure and immediate fascial closure groups consisted of 3,354 patients each. Median age was 65 years, and 52.6% were female. The delayed fascial closure group had a higher in-hospital mortality (35.3% vs 25.0%, P &lt; .001), a higher 30-day mortality (38.6% vs 29.0%, P &lt; .001), a higher proportion of acute kidney injury (9.5% vs 6.6%, P &lt; .001), a lower proportion of postoperative sepsis (11.8% vs 15.6%, P &lt; .001), and a lower proportion of surgical site infection (3.4% vs 7.0%, P &lt; .001). Compared with immediate fascial closure, delayed fascial closure is associated with an increased mortality in the patients matched based on comorbidities and surgical site contamination. In emergency general surgery, delaying abdominal closure may not have the presumed overarching benefits, and its indications must be further defined in this population."

    "abstract": "Background Acute care surgery (ACS) is a novel model for the provision of emergency general surgery (GS) care. Investigating the impact of the ACS team on the management of acute emergencies can help in establishing proper management measures and improving patient care in an emergency setting. The study aims to compare the performance indicators and patient outcomes such as hospital length of stay (LOS), time to diagnosis, and operation before and after the implementation of the acute care system. Methods The study reviewed two retrospective cohorts: the pre-ACS system (n = 202) from January 2012 to December 2013 and the post-ACS system (n = 188) from January 2014 to December 2015, which were done in a tertiary care center. All adult patients diagnosed with acute appendicitis and cholecystitis requiring emergency surgery were included. Results There was an improvement in the time interval between GS referral to the diagnosis of acute appendicitis and cholecystitis (p = 0.07) and from diagnosis to the start of the operation (p = 0.38). Patients in the post-ACS model had a shorter hospital stay than the pre-ACS model patients with [M = 3.69 SD(3.18) days versus M = 3.57 SD (3.60) days, p = 0.25]. Time from the emergency department arrival to GS referral did not show an improvement [M = 4.36 SD(3.34)] hours in the pre-ACS model versus [M = 4.53 SD(3.98)] hours in the ACS model, p = 0.86). Conclusion The ACS model led to earlier diagnosis of acute appendectomy and cholecystectomy cases and reduced the LOS. The introduction of the ACS model in Saudi Arabia showed improvement in patient care during acute emergencies. Further studies including multiple centers with larger sample sizes and longer review periods are needed to evaluate the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the ACS model."

    "abstract": "Investigating the context of trauma and acute care surgery, the article aims at understanding the factors that can enhance some ethical aspects, namely the importance of patient consent, the perceptiveness of the ethical role of the trauma leader, and the perceived importance of ethics as an educational subject. The article employs an international questionnaire promoted by the World Society of Emergency Surgery. Through the analysis of 402 fully filled questionnaires by surgeons from 72 different countries, the three main ethical topics are investigated through the lens of gender, membership of an academic or non-academic institution, an official trauma team, and a diverse group. In general terms, results highlight greater attention paid by surgeons belonging to academic institutions, official trauma teams, and diverse groups. Our results underline that some organizational factors (e.g., the fact that the team belongs to a university context or is more diverse) might lead to the development of a higher sensibility on ethical matters. Embracing cultural diversity forces trauma teams to deal with different mindsets. Organizations should, therefore, consider those elements in defining their organizational procedures. Trauma and acute care teams work under tremendous pressure and complex circumstances, with their members needing to make ethical decisions quickly. The international survey allowed to shed light on how team assembly decisions might represent an opportunity to coordinate team member actions and increase performance."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common disease affecting all segments of the population, including the frail elderly. Recent retrospective data suggest that earlier operative intervention may decrease morbidity. However, management decisions are influenced by surgical outcomes. Our goal was to determine the current surgical management of SBO in older patients with particular attention to frailty and the timing of surgery. A retrospective review of patients over the age of 65 with a diagnosis of bowel obstruction (ICD-10 K56*) using the 2016 National Inpatient Sample (NIS). Demographics included age, race, insurance status, medical comorbidities, and median household income by zip code. Elixhauser comorbidities were used to derive a previously published frailty score using the NIS dataset. Outcomes included time to operation, mortality, discharge disposition, and hospital length of stay. Associations between demographics, frailty, timing of surgery, and outcomes were determined. 264,670 patients were included. Nine percent of the cohort was frail; overall mortality was 5.7%. Frail had 1.82 increased odds of mortality (95% CI 1.64-2.03). Hospital LOS was 1.6 times as long for frail patients; a quarter of the frail were discharged home. Frail patients waited longer for surgery (3.58 days vs 2.44 days; p < 0.001). Patients transferred from another facility had increased mortality (aOR 1.58; 95% CI 1.36-1.83). There was an increasing mortality associated with a delay in surgery. Patients with frailty and SBO have higher mortality, more frequent discharge to dependent living, longer hospital length of stay, and longer wait to operative intervention. Mortality is also associated with male gender, black race, transfer status from another facility, self-pay status, and low household income. Every day in delay in surgical intervention for those who underwent operations led to higher mortality. If meeting operative indications, older patients with bowel obstruction have a higher chance of survival if they undergo surgery earlier."

    "title": "What if You Need More Than One? More Acute Care Surgery Procedures Are Associated with Mortality.",
    "abstract": "Background: It is unknown whether having multiple acute care surgery (ACS) procedures performed in one admission confers additional risk. We hypothesized that having multiple procedures (for example, hernia repair plus bowel resection) would be associated with higher mortality. Patients and Methods: We identified all 2017 National Inpatient Sample admissions with ACS procedures including: colon, small bowel/appendix (SB), hernia, adhesiolysis, peptic ulcer procedures, gallbladder, debridement, other laparotomy, other laparoscopy. The total number of procedures for each admission and common dyad (two-procedure) and triad (three-procedure) combinations were identified. Logistic regression estimated the odds of in-hospital mortality for increasing procedure count and specific dyad and triad combinations, using patients with one procedure as the reference. Results: A total of 216,317 ACS patients (median age, 57, interquartile range [IQR], 43-70; 50.6% female) were included; 2.8% died. Patients with multiple procedures were more likely to die than patients with one procedure (7.4% vs. 1.9%). An increasing number of procedures was associated with higher odds of death (two procedures: odds ratio [OR], 3.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9-3.2] to six or more procedures, OR, 9.5; 95% CI, 4.9-18.5); having more than three procedures was associated with at least fivefold higher odds of death. Specific dyads/triads were associated with particularly high risk of mortality, including ulcer/laparotomy (OR, 15.5; 95% CI, 13.7-17.5) and laparotomy/SB (OR, 8.31; 95% CI, 5.15-13.40). Conclusions: Multiple ACS procedures in one hospitalization confer increased odds of in-hospital mortality. This knowledge enables the ACS providers to better counsel patients by giving more specific expectations regarding mortality based on the number of procedures required or anticipated during an admission."

    "abstract": "The 6-bed critical care resuscitation unit (CCRU) is a unique and specialized intensive care unit (ICU) that streamlines the interhospital transfer (IHT-transfer between different hospitals) process for a wide range of patients with critical illness or time-sensitive disease. Previous studies showed the unit successfully increased the number of ICU admissions while reducing the time of transfer in the first year of its establishment. However, its sustainability is unknown. This was a descriptive retrospective analysis of adult, non-trauma patients who were transferred to an 800-bed quaternary medical center. Patients transferred to our medical center between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2018 were eligible. We used interrupted time series (ITS) and descriptive analyses to describe the trend and compare the transfer process between patients who were transferred to the CCRU versus those transferred to other adult inpatient units. From 2014 to 2018, 50,599 patients were transferred to our medical center; 31,582 (62%) were non-trauma adults. Compared with the year prior to the opening of the CCRU, ITS showed a significant increase in IHT after the establishment of the CCRU. The CCRU received a total of 7,788 (25%) IHTs during this period or approximately 20% of total transfers per year. Most transfers (41%) occurred via ground. Median and interquartile range [IQR] of transfer times to other ICUs (156 [65-1027] minutes) were longer than the CCRU (46 [22-139] minutes, P < 0.001). For the CCRU, the most common accepting services were cardiac surgery (16%), neurosurgery (11%), and emergency general surgery (10%). The CCRU increases the overall number of transfers to our institution, improves patient access to specialty care while decreasing transfer time, and continues to be a sustainable model over time. Additional research is needed to determine if transferring patients to the CCRU would continue to improve patients' outcomes and hospital revenue."

We reported a wide use of OA in septic abdomen (90% of cases). We had a low rate of EAF, short ICU stay and OA duration. These results are related to the fact that patients were treated by a dedicated EGS team, suggesting that OA management should be cared for as much as possible by trained and experienced surgeons. Prospective studies with more accurate patient selection are needed to prove our conclusions."

We sought to evaluate the management and outcomes of surgical patients presenting to Salima District Hospital (SDH) in Malawi. Using the SDH surgery registry, we compared patients managed operatively and those non-operatively and performed logistic regression to identify factors associated with operative management. We then compared cases performed at SDH with procedures recommended to be performed at DHs. We included 1374 patients, of whom half were managed operatively. The most common procedures performed were abscess drainage and wound debridement. Logistic regression analysis revealed that patients with abdominal diagnoses were least likely to be treated operatively. Though SDH performs most procedures recommended for the district hospital level, patients requiring laparotomies were most likely to be transferred to a referral hospital. Future studies should assess barriers to performing laparotomies at SDH."

However, its impact on outcomes of patients warranting emergency general surgery has not been well characterized. The present study examined the association of chronic kidney disease stage on in-hospital outcomes and readmission following emergency general surgery using a nationally representative cohort. The 2016-2018 Nationwide Readmissions Database was queried to identify all adult hospitalizations for 1 of 6 common emergency general surgery operations. Patients were stratified by severity of chronic kidney disease into stages 1-3, stages 4-5, end-stage renal disease, and others (non-chronic kidney disease). Regression models were used to examine factors associated with mortality, readmissions, and costs. Of an estimated 985,101 patients undergoing emergency general surgery, 60,949 (6.2%) had a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (1-3: 67.1%, 4-5: 11.5%, end-stage renal disease: 23.4%). Unadjusted rates of mortality increased with chronic kidney disease in a stepwise manner (2.1% in non-chronic kidney disease to 16.9 in end-stage renal disease, P < .001), as did 90-day readmissions (9.2% to 29.7%, respectively, P < .001). After adjustment, all stages of chronic kidney disease exhibited increases in risk-adjusted rates of mortality (range: 0.2% in chronic kidney disease 1-3 to 12.2% in end-stage renal disease, P < .001). Relative to non-chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease had the greatest cost burden for those undergoing small bowel resection (β +$83,600) and the least in cholecystectomy (+$30,400). Chronic kidney disease severity is associated with a stepwise increase in mortality, hospitalization costs, and 90-day readmissions. Our findings may better inform shared decision-making and have implications in benchmarking. Further studies for optimal management strategies in this high-risk group are needed."

The quick sequential organ failure assessment score (qSOFA) has not been studied for EGS patients. Retrospective cohort study in adult patients undergoing abdominal EGS at a university tertiary care center from 2016 to 2018. The primary outcome was mortality. The effect of clinical variables on outcomes was assessed in univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Based on these results, the qSOFA score was modified. The performance of scores was assessed using receiver operating characteristics. Five hundred seventy-eight patients undergoing abdominal EGS were included. In-hospital mortality was 4.8% (28/578). Independent predictors for mortality were mesenteric ischemia (odds ratio [OR] 15.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.2-48.6; p < 0.001), gastrointestinal tract perforation (OR 4.9; 95% CI 1.7-14.0; p = 0.003), 65 years or older (OR 4.1; 95% CI 1.5-11.4; p = 0.008), and increasing qSOFA (OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.2-2.8; p = 0.007).

Multi-disciplinary work-up is crucial to achieving a comprehensive understanding of these patients. The present study demonstrated the experience of an acute care surgery (ACS) model for rib fracture management from a single level I trauma center over 13 years. Data from patients diagnosed with acute rib fractures from January 2008 to December 2020 were collected from the trauma registry of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH). Information, including patient age, sex, injury mechanism, Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) in different anatomic regions, injury severity score (ISS), index admission department, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), total admission LOS, mortality, and other characteristics of multiple rib fracture, were analyzed. Patients who received surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) were analyzed separately, and basic demographics and clinical outcomes were compared between acute care and thoracic surgeons. A total of 5103 patients diagnosed with acute rib fracture were admitted via the emergency department (ED) of CGMH in the 13-year study period. The Department of Trauma and Emergency Surgery (TR) received the most patients (70.8%), and the Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery (CTS) received only 3.1% of the total patients. SSRF was initiated in 2017, and TR performed fixation for 141 patients, while CTS operated for 16 patients. The basic demographics were similar between the two groups, and no significant differences were noted in the outcomes, including LOS, LCU LOS, length of indwelling chest tube, or complications. There was only one mortality in all SSRF patients, and the patient was from the CTS group. Acute care surgeons provided good-quality care to rib fracture patients, whether SSRF or non-SSRF. Acute care surgeons also safely performed SSRF. Therefore, we propose that the ACS model may be an option for rib fracture management, depending on the deployment of staff in each institute."

This is a retrospective review of patients referred to the acute general surgery (ACS) service at a tertiary hospital for management of cancer-related problem from July 2017 to September 2018. Patient demographics, course in hospital, and survival were recorded. Multivariant logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier estimates were performed. One hundred eighty-nine patients were identified (53% female) with a mean age of 65.9 years. Forty-two patients (22%) were newly diagnosed with cancer on presentation, and 94 (50%) patients had metastatic disease. Cancer staging was completed in 84% of patients, and 65% had multidisciplinary team (MDT) assessment during their hospital stay. Surgery was performed on 90 (48%) patients, of which 31.2% was with palliative intent. Overall mortality was 56% with 30- and 60-day mortality of 15% and 22%, respectively. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for a 60-day mortality was high in patients presenting with new cancer diagnosis (OR 3.18, 95% CI 1.18-9.02, p=0.03), metastatic disease (OR 5.11, 95% CI 2.03-12.85, p=0.001), or systemic therapy on presentation (OR 3.46, 95% CI 1.30-9.22, p=0.013). Emergency surgical referral is common in patients with malignancy. Surgical decision making can be challenging due to the heterogeneity of this population and their associated comorbidities. Optimizing prognostic determinants such as goal-directed palliative care, MDT discussions, and bridging to systemic therapy can improve patient outcomes."

For hepatopancreaticobiliary conditions, operative management was associated with lower risk of mortality at 30 days [-2.6% (95% confidence interval: -4.0, -1.3)], 90 days [-4.7% (-6.50, -2.8)], and 180 days [-6.4% (-8.5, -4.2)]. Among 56,582 intestinal obstruction patients, operative management was associated with a higher risk of inpatient mortality [2.8% (0.7, 4.9)] but no significant difference thereafter. For upper gastrointestinal conditions, operative management was associated with a 9.7% higher risk of in-hospital mortality (6.4, 13.1), which increased over time. There was a 6.9% higher risk of inpatient mortality (3.6, 10.2) with operative management for colorectal conditions, which increased over time. For general abdominal conditions, operative management was associated with 12.2% increased risk of inpatient mortality (8.7, 15.8). This effect was attenuated at 30 days [8.5% (3.8, 13.2)] and nonsignificant thereafter. The effect of operative emergency general surgery management varied across conditions and over time. For colorectal and upper gastrointestinal conditions, outcomes are superior with nonoperative management, whereas surgery is favored for patients with hepatopancreaticobiliary conditions. For obstructions and general abdominal conditions, results were equivalent overall. These findings may support patients, clinicians, and families making these challenging decisions."

    "abstract": "Patients with MetS or SIRS experience higher rates of mortality and morbidity, across both cardiac and noncardiac surgery. Frailty assessment has acquired increasing importance in recent years as it predisposes elderly patients to a worse outcome. The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of MetS, SIRS, and with or without frailty on elderly patients undergoing emergency surgical procedures. We analyzed data of all patients with nonmalignant diseases requiring an emergency surgical procedure from January 2017 to December 2020. The occurrence of MetS was identified using modified definition criteria used by the NCEP-ATP III Expert Panel: obesity, hypertension, diabetes, or if medication for high triglycerides or for low HDL cholesterol was taken. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) was evaluated according to the original consensus study (Sepsis-1). The frailty profile was investigated by the 5-modified Frailty Index (5-mFI) and the Emergency Surgery Frailty Index (EmSFI). Postoperative complications have been reported and categorized according to the Clavien-Dindo (C-D) classification system. Morbidity and mortality have been mainly considered as the 30-day standard period definition. Of the 2,318 patients included in this study, 1,010 (43.6%) fulfilled the criteria for MetS (MetsG group). Both 5-Items score and EmsFI showed greater fragility in patients with MetS. All patients with MetS showed more frequently a CACI index greater than 6. The occurrence of SIRS was higher in MetSG. LOS was longer in patients with MetS (MetSG 11.4 ± 12 days vs. n-MetSG 10.5 ± 10.2 days, p = 0.046). MetSG has a significantly higher rate of morbidity (353 (35.%) vs. 385 (29.4%), p = 0.005). The mortality rate in patients with MetS (98/1010, 10%) was similar to that in patients without it (129/1308, 10%). Considering patients with MetS who developed SIRS and those who had frailty or both, the occurrence of these conditions was associated with a higher rate of morbidity and mortality. Impact of MetS and SIRS on elderly surgical patient outcomes has yet to be fully elucidated. The present study showed a 43.6% incidence of MetS in the elderly population. In conclusion, age per se should be not considered anymore as the main variable to estimate patient outcomes, while MetS and Frailty should have always a pivotal role."

    "abstract": "The pandemic effects due to the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 caused a health emergency. We decided to carry out a study with the aim to investigate the changes in patients' tendencies for admission to the emergency department for surgical diseases, and the related hospitalizations and urgent surgery rates. We carried out a retrospective, observational study on patients who received emergency general surgery consultation at our University Hospital during the two COVID-19 pandemic periods and on the same dates one year before. The patients' demographic characteristics, their hospitalization in surgical department and the data about those who underwent urgent surgery were retrospectively recorded. In the period March-April 2020 there were 95 surgical visits recorded; among these patients, 25% required hospitalization and 12.63% underwent urgent surgery. In the period November-December-January 2020-2021 there were 156 surgical consultations, of which 35.26% required hospitalization and 21.15% underwent urgent surgery. In both considered periods we found that the number of surgical consultations decreased compared to the same periods of the previous year. Moreover, we found a higher rate of hospitalization and need for urgent surgery. We documented a significant reduction in the overall number of surgical consultations and an increase of hospitalization and urgent surgery rates."

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the health-care system unpredictably. Restrictions and precautions have had a significant impact on the volume and nature of admissions in emergency services. In this study, we hypothesized that the pandemic would result in a change in the number of emergencies admitted to the general surgery inpatient service and a worse patient outcome compared to the previous year. A retrospective analysis of emergency general surgical admissions during the first 6 months of the pandemic and the same period in 2019 was conducted. Demographics, laboratory assessments, diagnosis, treatment strategies, and postoperative out-comes were analyzed. 761 patients were admitted to the general surgery service during two 6-month periods (392 vs. 369, respectively). This represented a 5.9% reduction in admissions. However, in the first 2 months of the pandemic, the number of emergency general surgical admissions decreased by 37.1% and 43.7%, respectively. Comparison of periods demonstrated no significant differences in demograph-ics, laboratory values, incidence of emergencies, treatment strategies, and hospital stay. Acute appendicitis, cholecystitis, and bowel obstruction were the three most common surgical emergencies in the pandemic. However, there was no significant difference in outcomes between the periods when each surgical emergency was evaluated separately. Pandemic appears to affect general surgical admissions with a fluctuating pattern, an increasing trend following a sig-nificant 2-month decrease. These findings suggest that patients presented with a delayed presentation; however, contrary to concerns, there was no difference in patient outcomes between the two periods. This study provides a perspective in management strategies for surgical emergencies in such unusual conditions."

    "abstract": "In order to facilitate the preoperative prediction of complicated appendicitis, we propose a complementary approach by selecting an endpoint defined by the intraoperative finding of peritoneal soiling (PS). Over a 6-month period, 38 centers (5% of all public hospitals) attending emergency general surgery patients on a 24-h, 7-days a week basis, enrolled consecutive adult patients requiring appendectomy. Patients were stratified according to the absence or the finding of PS during the surgical procedure. A total of 2645 patients were included; median age (IQR) was 35 (22-51) years, 44.3% were female. The laparoscopic approach was used in 70.8% of appendectomies. In a third of patients (31.7%), there was PS with pus around the appendix, or bowel contents, free pus, or blood in the peritoneal cavity. To develop the prediction model, 1764 patients were randomly selected for the derivation cohort and the remaining 881 patients were assigned to the validation cohort. On multivariable logistic regression analysis of all patients, two clinical variables (age, and pulse) and three laboratory variables (serum urea, serum sodium, and white blood cell count) were individually associated (P < .05) with a greater probability of having PS (Hosmer-Lemeshow chi, 1.63; P = .99; C-statistic, 0.7). Based on the multivariable regression model, both static and dynamic nomograms were developed for the prediction of PS in patients with acute appendicitis. The entry of simple clinical and laboratory variables in the dynamic nomogram may be useful in guiding the initial management of patients with acute appendicitis in resource-limited settings."

    "abstract": "Interfacility transfer to a referral center is often considered for patients with liver disease undergoing nonelective cholecystectomy given management complexities and perioperative risk. We sought to determine the association between the Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, transfer frequency, and outcomes in those patients using a national database. The ACS-NSQIP participant use files were queried for nonelective open or laparoscopic cholecystectomy from 2016 to 2018. Patients were grouped according to low (6-11), intermediate (12-18), or high (>18) MELD. In the high MELD group, patient characteristics and outcomes were compared between transferred and nontransferred patients and multivariate regression was performed to evaluate independent predictors of outcomes. Outcomes included in-hospital mortality, complications, length-of-stay (LOS), and 30-d reoperation and readmission. 30,171 subjects were included. Transfer was more likely as MELD increased (19.5% high versus 12.1% low, P < 0.001). High MELD patients had increased LOS, reoperation, readmission, and mortality rates compared to low MELD. In high MELD patients (n = 1016), those transferred were more likely older, white, obese, and septic. Transferred patients had increased mortality (7.6% versus 4.2%, P = 0.044), LOS, reoperation, and complications. After controlling for differences between transferred and nontransferred patients, transfer status was not independently associated with mortality (OR = 1.593, P = 0.177), postoperative complications or LOS, but was associated with increased risk for reoperation. Sepsis and laparoscopic surgery were independently associated with higher and lower mortality, respectively. Transfer status is not independently associated with mortality, postoperative complications, or prolonged LOS, suggesting patients with advanced liver disease undergoing acute cholecystectomy may not benefit from interfacility transfer."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) patients account for more than one-third of admissions to hospitals in the National Health Service (NHS) in England. The associated mortality of these patients has been quoted as approximately eight times higher than that of elective surgical admissions. This study used a modified Delphi approach to identify research priorities in EGS. The aim was to establish a research agenda using a formal consensus-based approach in an effort to identify questions relevant to EGS that could ultimately guide research to improve outcomes for this cohort. Three rounds were conducted using an electronic questionnaire and involved health care professionals, research personnel, patients and their relatives. In the first round, stakeholders were invited to submit clinical research questions that they felt were priorities for future research. In rounds two and three, participants were asked to score individual questions in order of priority using a 5-point Likert scale. Between rounds, an expert panel analysed results before forwarding questions to subsequent rounds. Ninety-two EGS research questions were proposed in Phase 1. Following the first round of prioritisation, forty-seven questions progressed to the final phase. A final list of seventeen research questions were identified from the final round of prioritisation, categorised as condition-specific questions of high interest within general EGS, emergency colorectal surgery, non-technical and health services research. A broad range of research questions were identified including questions on peri-operative strategies, EGS outcomes in older patients, as well as non-technical and technical influences on EGS outcomes. Our study provides a consensus delivered framework that should determine the research agenda for future EGS projects. It may also assist setting priorities for research funding and multi-centre collaborative strategies within the academic clinical interest of EGS."

    "abstract": "Interhospital transfer of emergency general surgery patients continues to rise, and no system for transfer of emergency general surgery patients exists. This has major implications for cost of care and patient experience. We performed a scoping review to understand outcomes related to transfer and the associated factors and to identify any opportunities for improvement. Studies involving emergency general surgery patients with interhospital transfer were identified by searching OVID MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Scopus. There were 1,785 records identified. After duplicates were removed, there were 1,303 articles screened in the initial phase. Fifty-eight articles were included in the second phase. Eventually, 21 articles were included in the review. Thirty-seven articles were removed during the full-text screening phase due to the following: wrong publication type (2), wrong population (8), abstract (11), outside the United States (3), and wrong study design (6). Transferred patients had a higher mortality rate, were older, were more likely to be male and to undergo reoperation, and had higher resource utilization compared to patients who were not transferred. All emergency general surgery patients had a high burden of chronic disease. Unnecessary transfer, typically defined by lack of intervention and discharge within 72 hours, was reported to be 8.8% to 19%. Emergency general surgery patients have a high rate of comorbidities. Limited physiologic status information prior to patient transfer limits understanding of the necessity for transfer. Areas for improvement include assigning a physiologic status for all patients and utilizing telehealth. More detailed information needs to be captured to determine the appropriateness of transfer."

    "abstract": "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals reported decreased admissions for acute surgical diagnoses, but scant data was available to quantify the decrease and its consequences. The objective of this study was to examine the incidence of acute care surgery encounters before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. A retrospective cohort study was performed at a single, urban, United States safety-net hospital. Emergency room encounters, admissions, non-elective surgical procedures, patient acuity, and surgical complications were compared before and after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary outcome of the study was the incidence rate (IR) and incidence rate ratios (IRR) for surgical admissions, laparoscopic appendectomy, and urgent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. During the COVID-19 (exposure) time period, the number of nonelective procedures was 143 (IR 4.76) which was significantly lower than the control periods (n = 431, IR 7.2), P < 0.001. During the COVID-19 exposure period, there were significantly fewer urgent cholecystectomies performed (1.37 per day versus 2.80-2.93 per day, P < 0.001). There was a trend toward fewer appendectomies performed, but not significant. There was little difference in patient acuity between the exposure and control periods. A higher proportion of patients that underwent urgent cholecystectomy during the COVID time period had been seen in the ED in the prior 30 d (22% versus 5.6%). Surgical volume significantly decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Management of acute cholecystitis may require re-evaluation as nonsurgical management appears to increase repeat presentations."

    "abstract": "Intussusception is an extraordinary cause of acute abdomen in adults and has been defined as the telescoping of a bowel segment into the lumen of an adjacent segment. A 43-year-old female presented to our hospital's emergency department (ED) with 10+ episodes of bloody diarrhea per day, left-sided abdominal pain, and the inability to tolerate oral intake for one month. She was initially diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (UC) ten years ago and is currently on mesalamine oral and enema therapy. She presented to our gastroenterology clinic two weeks after the beginning of her flare and was started on prednisone 40 mg daily. This did not improve her symptoms, and she presented to the ED two weeks later. She underwent a computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis which revealed intussusception in the left hemiabdomen with no definite lead point measuring 5.6 cm in the craniocaudal dimension with pneumatosis and no evidence of bowel obstruction. There were no other significant laboratory abnormalities. Acute care surgery was consulted and suggested obtaining a CT enterography for further evaluation which showed spontaneous resolution of intussusception with no evidence of pneumatosis, portal venous gas, or intraperitoneal free air. She reports that following oral contrast intake, she \"felt movement and relaxation\" in her abdomen with substantial pain relief. Infectious workup was negative, and therapy was initiated with intravenous steroids. In conclusion, intussusception has been very rarely reported in patients with UC with the most common treatment being surgical resection. However, conservative management in the absence of bowel obstruction can be attempted."

We created a geriatric surgical service with geriatric and palliative expertise to mitigate risks of hospitalization most hazardous to older patients. We sought to identify geriatric surgical service interventions most relevant to EGS patients. We prospectively identified patients ≥75 years admitted to the EGS service at an urban tertiary care hospital from January 2020-March 2021 who screened positive for frailty (FRAIL score ≥3 [scale 0-5, higher being worse]) or with cognitive impairment. A pilot geriatric surgical service, led by a dually-board certified geriatric and palliative care specialist, conducted a comprehensive geriatric assessment and modified Rockwood Frailty Index calculation for each eligible patient. Patient, hospital admission, and geriatric consultation characteristics were collected via chart review. Fifty consecutive patients (median age 82 years [IQR 78-90], 56% female) received geriatric consultation (median time 3 days [IQR 1-6] from admission). The most common admission diagnosis was bowel obstruction (32%). Sixty-four percent of patients underwent ≥1 surgical procedure. Using the Frailty Index, 64% were moderately or severely frail. Interventions most frequently performed by the geriatric team included delirium prevention and management (66%), consideration of swallowing function (52%), individualized pain management (50%), and facilitation of serious illness conversations (58%). Geriatric service involvement addresses a high burden of both geriatric and palliative care needs in older EGS patients. Geriatric recommendations may direct interventions for surgical education in fundamental geriatric and palliative care knowledge to maximize geriatric resources for the most high-risk patients."

    "abstract": "Bouveret syndrome is a rare condition characterised by gastric outlet obstruction secondary to a gallstone fistulating into the proximal duodenum or pylorus. Although rare, this condition carries a high mortality rate and no current standardised guidelines for management. We present a case of a patient in their 60s with recurrent small bowel obstruction secondary to a cholecysto-duodenal fistula and large gallstone which became impacted in the fourth part of the duodenum. The patient had a P-POSSUM Score of 14% mortality and 60% morbidity risk, had multiple co-morbidities, was bedbound, BMI 59 and had been deemed high risk for general anaesthetic at oncology centre for a 10 × 10 cm likely gynaecological malignancy a month prior to this admission. In contrast to existing literature, endoscopic lithotripsy was considered but not attempted due to unavailability of this service locally. Surgical intervention was decided based on radiological features of impending duodenal perforation on CT imaging and multiple disciplinary team discussion. The patient was managed with open enterolithotomy at the duodeno-jejunal (DJ) flexure and discharged 3 weeks post-operatively at her pre-operative baseline. This is the first report to our knowledge to describe successful surgical management of a gallstone impacted in the fourth part of the duodenum. In cases where anatomical location of impaction precludes retrieval via simple gastrostomy, we suggest using high pressure flush to mobilise the stone to more favourable location distally. We emphasise that stone size should be considered when planning surgical management."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate differences in ED work-up of general surgical patients between emergency physicians and PA/APRNs. A retrospective review was conducted of patients presenting to the ED with the chief complaint of abdominal pain.

Emergency physicians saw the majority (61.2%) of patients. Emergency physicians saw older patients (62.0 vs. 45.5 years; p = 0.017), and more patients that were anemic (28.3% vs. 14.3%) or with elevated creatinine levels (46.7% vs. 25.7%).

Patients seen by emergency physicians had a longer length of hospital stay (4.5 vs. 2 days; p = 0.002). Time in the ED and time to surgical consult did not vary between groups although patients first seen by emergency physicians had potentially higher acuity.

Retrospective observational study using state discharge data. Medicare beneficiaries who underwent an operation for an emergency general surgery condition in New York, Florida, or Pennsylvania (2012-2013). Patients were classified as multimorbid using Qualifying Comorbidity Sets (QCSs). Outcomes included in-hospital mortality, hospital length of stay and discharge status. Of 312,160 patients, a large minority (37.4%) were multimorbid. Non-QCS patients did not have a specific combination of comorbidities to satisfy a QCS, but 64.1% of these patients had 3+ comorbid conditions. Multimorbidity was associated with increased in-hospital mortality (10.5% vs. 3.9%, P <0.001), decreased rates of discharge to home (16.2% vs. 37.1%, P <0.001), and longer length of stay (10.4 d±13.5 vs. 6.7 d±9.3, P <0.001) when compared with non-QCS patients. Risks varied between individual QCSs. Multimorbidity, defined by satisfying a specific QCS, is strongly associated with poor outcomes for older patients requiring emergency general surgery in the United States. Variation in risk of in-hospital mortality, discharge status, and length of stay between individual QCSs suggests that multimorbidity does not carry the same prognostic weight as having multiple comorbidities-the specifics of which are important in setting expectations for individual, complex patients."

EGS admissions during the UK lockdown period (March to May 2020) were compared with the same period in 2019. Patient demographics were recorded together with clinical presentation, hospital stay and treatment outcomes, and readmission data. The study included 645 patients, comprising 223 in the COVID-19 period and 422 in the non-COVID-19 period. There was no difference in age, sex, comorbidity or socio-economic status. A lower proportion of patients of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnicity (BAME) were admitted during the pandemic (20.6% vs 35.4%, p < 0.05). The duration of symptoms prior to presentation was longer, and admission clinical parameters and serum inflammatory markers. More patients presented with an acute kidney injury (9.9% vs 4.7%, p = 0.012). There was no difference in perioperative outcomes or 30-day mortality, but more patients were readmitted following conservative management (10.6% vs 4.7%, p = 0.023). The reorganisation of EGS to a senior-led model has been successful in terms of outcomes and access to treatment despite a more unwell population. There was a significantly lower proportion of BAME admissions suggesting additional barriers to healthcare access under pandemic lockdown conditions."

During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, as New York City (NYC) emerged as the US epicenter, hospitals saw a marked reduction in patients presenting with non-COVID-related diseases. The objective of this study was to characterize the effects of the pandemic on the incidence, presentation, and management of AA. A retrospective analysis of patients with AA who presented to two academic medical centers during the NYC COVID peak (March 22nd-May 31st, 2020) was performed. This group was compared to a control cohort presenting during the same period in 2019. Primary outcomes included the incidence of AA, complicated disease, and management. Secondary outcomes included duration of symptoms, hospital length of stay, and complication rates. Statistical analyses were performed using Mann-Whitney U, Chi-square, and Fisher's exact tests. A 49.1% reduction in the incidence of AA was seen between 2019 (n = 114) and 2020 (n = 58). Median duration of symptoms doubled from 1 day in 2019 to 2 days in 2020 (P < .02). Proportionally, the incidence of complicated appendicitis rose from 19.3% to 41.4% (P < .005). 32.4% of patients with uncomplicated AA underwent non-operative management in 2020, compared to 12% in 2019 (P < .02). Hospital length of stay and complication rates were similar between years. Significantly fewer AA patients presented during the initial phase of the pandemic. Patients presented later, which may have contributed to a higher proportion of complicated disease. Surgeons were also more likely to treat uncomplicated AA nonoperatively than they were prior. Further research is needed to understand the long-term consequences of these changes."

Risk prediction models are needed to guide decision making in this high-risk population. Existing models have substantial limitations and lack external validation, potentially limiting their applicability in clinical use. We aimed to derive and validate, both internally and externally, a multivariable model to predict 30-day mortality risk in older patients undergoing emergency general surgery. After protocol publication, we used the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database (2012-6; estimated to contain 90% data from the USA and 10% from Canada) to derive and internally validate a model to predict 30-day mortality for older people having emergency general surgery using logistic regression with elastic net regularisation. Internal validation was done with 10-fold cross-validation. External validation was done using a temporally separate health administrative database exclusively from Ontario, Canada. Overall, 6012 (12.0%) of the 50 221 patients died within 30 days. The model demonstrated strong discrimination (area under the curve [AUC]=0.871) and calibration across the spectrum of observed and predicted risks. Ten-fold internal cross-validation demonstrated minimal optimism (AUC=0.851, optimism 0.019 [standard deviation=0.06]) with excellent calibration. External validation demonstrated lower discrimination (AUC=0.700) and degraded calibration. A multivariable mortality risk prediction model was strongly discriminative and well calibrated internally. However, poor external validation suggests the model may not be generalisable to non-NSQIP data and hospitals. The findings highlight the importance of external validation before clinical application of risk models."

These calculators are gaining popularity as validated tools to help surgeons estimate mortality and complications following emergency general surgery (EGS). However, the accuracy of risk estimates generated by these calculators compared to risk estimation by practicing surgeons has not been explored. Acute care surgeons at a quaternary care center prospectively estimated 30-d mortality and complications for adult EGS patients (2019-2021). Surgeon predictions were compared to Predictive OpTimal Trees in Emergency Surgery Risk (POTTER) and NSQIP estimates. Observed-to-expected (O:E) ratios of median aggregate estimates were calculated. C-statistics for surgeon and calculator estimations were utilized to quantify predictive accuracy. Among 150 patients (median 61 y, 45% male), 30-d mortality was 15% (n = 23). Observed rates of prolonged mechanical ventilation and acute renal failures were 30% and 10%, respectively. Overall, surgeon predictions were similar to risk calculator estimates for mortality (c-statistics 0.843 [surgeon] versus 0.848 [POTTER] and 0.815 [NSQIP]) and need for prolonged ventilation (c-statistics 0.801 versus 0.722 and 0.689, respectively). Surgeons tended to overestimate complication risks. Surgeon experience was not significantly associated with mortality prediction in an adjusted model. Acute care surgeons at a quaternary care center predicted postoperative mortality and complications with similar discrimination when compared to surgical risk calculators. Surgeon expertise should be utilized in conjunction with risk calculators when counseling EGS patients regarding anticipated postoperative outcomes. Surgeons should be cognizant of patterns in overestimation or underestimation of complications."

    "title": "Defining a Body Mass Index Threshold for Preventing Recurrence in Ventral Hernia Repairs.",
    "abstract": "Body mass index (BMI) has been established as an independent risk factor for complications after abdominal hernia repairs. While various thresholds have been proposed, there is no consensus for an ideal BMI for elective hernia repair. To identify the BMI threshold at which risk for hernia recurrence is significantly increased in patients undergoing ventral and incisional hernia repair. This retrospective review of medical records included patients who underwent ventral or incisional hernia repairs from 2014 to 2020 at a single institution. Patients with hernia defects ≥4 cm were included. The primary outcome measure was hernia recurrence. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis was used to determine the BMI threshold for recurrence. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to validate the threshold and to evaluate factors associated with recurrence. Of the 175 patients included, 9.1% had a recurrence. Classification and Regression Tree analysis identified BMI 35.3 kg/m2 as the critical threshold for hernia recurrence. In bivariate analysis, compared to patients who had no recurrence, patients with recurrence were more likely to have cirrhosis (12.5% vs 0%, P = .008), incarcerated hernias (75.0% vs 31.4%, P = .001), urgent surgery (75.0% vs 22.0%, P = <.001), biologic and no mesh use (25.0% vs 6.4% and 12.5% vs 5.7%, P = .012), and BMI >35.3 kg/m2 (75.0% vs 25.8%, P < .001). In multivariate regression, only BMI >35.3 kg/m2 was associated with recurrence [OR: 20.58 (95% CI: 2.17-194.87), P = .008]. Body mass index >35.3 kg/m2 was the only independent factor associated with hernia recurrence. This highlights the importance of determining a BMI threshold for patients undergoing ventral or incisional hernia repair."

    "abstract": "Frailty is a potential modifiable predictor of surgical outcomes in older adults. The impact of frailty following appendectomy, a common urgent operation, is unknown for older adults. The study aim was to assess if frailty is associated with worse perioperative outcomes after appendectomy in older adults. We used the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database from 2016 to 2018 and identified patients 65 and older who underwent appendectomy for acute appendicitis. We identified frailty as a Modified Frailty Index (MFI) score ≥2. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the association of frailty with 30-day mortality, serious complications, readmission, and discharge to facility. Five thousand seven hundred twenty-eight older adults underwent appendectomy, of which 29.1% were 75 or older, 53.3% female, 74.9% non-Hispanic White, and 17.1% frail. Frail patients experienced worse outcomes: mortality (frail: 1.0% vs non-frail: .3%, P = .001), serious complications (14.2% vs 8.0%, P = <.0001), and discharge to facility (9.3% vs 2.3%, P < .0001). On multivariate logistic regression, frailty was associated with increased mortality (odds ratio [OR] 3.34; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28-8.66), serious complications (OR 1.51; 95% CI: 1.17-1.93), and discharge to facility (OR 2.80; 95% CI: 2.00-3.93). Frailty was not significantly associated with readmission (P = .180). Frailty is associated with worse postoperative outcomes following appendectomy in older adults. As frailty is potentially modifiable, it should be routinely assessed and utilized in perioperative optimization and counseling, especially with respect to patient-centered outcomes."

    "abstract": "Non-operative management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis is an option, but omission of antibiotics from the regimen has not been tested. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, superiority RCT in adults with CT-confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis was designed to compare placebo with antibiotics (intravenous ertapenem followed by oral levofloxacin and metronidazole). The primary endpoint was treatment success (resolution resulting in discharge without appendicectomy within 10 days); secondary outcomes included pain scores, complications, hospital stay, and return to work. From May 2017 to September 2020, 72 patients with a mean(s.d.) age of 37.5 (11.1) years were recruited at five hospitals. Six were excluded after randomization (5 early consent withdrawals, 1 randomization protocol violation), 35 were assigned to receive antibiotics, and 31 to receive placebo. Enrolment challenges (including hospital pharmacy resources in an acute-care surgery setting) meant that only the lowest sample size of three predefined scenarios was achieved. The 10-day treatment success rate was 87 (95 per cent c.i. 75 to 99) per cent for placebo and 97 (92 to 100) per cent for antibiotics. This clinical difference of 10 (90 per cent c.i. -0.9 to 21) per cent was not statistically different for the primary outcome (1-sided P = 0.142), and secondary outcomes were similar. The lack of antibiotic superiority statistically suggests that a non-inferiority trial against placebo is warranted in adults with CT-confirmed mild appendicitis. Registration number: EudraCT 2015-003634-26 (https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/eudract-web/index.faces), NCT03234296 (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov). Appendicitis was the most common reason for emergency surgery, but we now know that mild and severe acute appendicitis are two different diseases. Severe appendicitis still necessitates removal of the appendix but antibiotics alone are an option for mild disease. This small study found that most cases of mild appendicitis to resolve even without antibiotics. Larger studies (more patients) would be needed to show that omitting antibiotics is safe and no worse than antibiotic therapy for milder acute appendicitis."

    "abstract": "Acute deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism collectively known as venous thromboembolism (VTE), are associated with increased risk of poor clinical sequelae during inpatient hospitalizations. We examined the association of VTE with mortality, readmissions, and costs among patients undergoing emergency general surgery (EGS) operations using a national cohort. Adult hospitalizations for EGS (laparotomy, small bowel resection, large bowel resection, appendectomy, lysis of adhesions, cholecystectomy, and repair of perforated ulcer) within two days of admission were identified in the 2016-18 Nationwide Readmissions Database. Hospitalizations were stratified based on diagnosis of VTE and others (n-VTE). Of an estimated 860,747 EGS patients 7,513, (.87%) developed VTE during the index hospitalization. Patients in the VTE group were on average older (65.5 ± 15.3 vs 54.8 ± 18.6 years, P < .001) and more commonly male (46.7 vs 39.3%, P < .001). Venous thromboembolism was independently associated with greater odds of mortality (AOR:1.7 95% CI 1.6-1.9), increased costs (+27,700 95% CI 23, 100-28,300) and greater odds of 30-day readmissions (AOR 1.3 95% CI 1.2-1.4). Despite national efforts to reduce its incidence, VTE affects nearly 1/100 EGS patients and is associated with increased odds of mortality as well as costs, and readmissions. Tailored approaches are warranted to reduce the impact of this pernicious complication."

    "abstract": "In low-income countries (LICs), patients with abdominal surgical emergencies often initially present to primary or district hospitals and are transferred to referral hospitals for surgical management. The transfer process introduces a delay to care, but the relationship between transfer time and outcomes has not been studied in LICs. We sought to evaluate the effect of transfer delays on postoperative outcomes among patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery in Malawi. This is a retrospective analysis of the acute care surgery database at Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH), a referral hospital in Malawi. Patients were eligible for inclusion if transferred from another facility to KCH for emergency abdominal surgery. We used logistic regression modeling to evaluate the relationship between transfer time and postoperative complications and mortality. The study included 2037 patients. Female patients, patients transferred from district hospitals, and patients with bowel obstructions were most likely to spend over three days at a referring facility before transfer. On regression modeling, each additional day until transfer was associated with an 18% increase in odds of developing a postoperative complication (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.05-1.31, p = 0.005) and a 19% increase in odds of postoperative mortality (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08-1.31, p < 0.001). Among patients requiring emergency abdominal surgery in Malawi, transfer delays are associated with higher postoperative complications and mortality rates. Further research should focus on identifying the factors causing delays so that interventions aimed at improving the transfer process can be developed."

    "abstract": "Laparoscopic appendectomy is one of the most common emergency general surgery procedures in the United States. Little is known about its postoperative outcomes for older adults because appendicitis typically occurs in younger patients. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between age and postoperative complications after appendectomy. We hypothesized that age would have a significant and nonlinear association with morbidity. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of individuals whose laparoscopic appendectomies were recorded in the Veterans Affairs (VA) Surgical Quality Improvement Program (from 2000-2018; n = 14,619) and National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (2005-2019; n = 349,909) databases. The primary outcome was 30-day morbidity. We used logistic regression with fractional polynomials to model nonlinear relationships between age and outcomes. The median age (interquartile range) of the nonveteran cohort was 36 years (26-51; 8.4% of patients were 65 or older) versus 51 years among veterans (35-63; 21% were 65 or older). For veterans and nonveterans, there was a significant and nonlinear relationship between age and risk of complications. In the nonveteran cohort, the predicted probability (with 95% confidence interval) of postoperative complications was 9.8% (9.7-10.1) at age 65, 11.9% (11.7-12.3) at age 75, and 14.5% (14.1-14.9) at age 85. Among veterans, the risk was 7.5% (6.9-8.1) at age 65, 8.3% (7.6-9.1) at age 75, and 9.1% (8.1-10.1) at age 85. For both veterans and nonveterans, older age was associated with a significantly increased risk of postoperative complications. Notably, morbidity within the VA was lower for older adults than in non-VA hospitals."

    "abstract": "The impact of age alone in relation to postoperative outcomes needs to be further elucidated. This study investigated whether increasing age was associated with increased morbidity and mortality for patients with no comorbidities undergoing acute care surgery (ACS). The 2016-2018 National Surgical Quality Improvement Project database was used to identify adult patients who underwent ACS performed on an urgent/emergent basis. Patients overweight or with pre-existing medical comorbidities were excluded. Patients were divided into age groups in decades. The association between outcomes and the different age groups, other patient characteristics, and perioperative factors was examined by multivariate logistic regression. 22,770 patients were identified, of which 73.5% were appendectomies, and 21.6% were open procedures. Increasing age correlated with higher unadjusted complication rates and mortality. Multivariate analyses revealed that compared to patients ≤ 30 years old, mortality was not different for patients 31-60 years old, but it was higher for the age groups > 61 years old. Patients aged 51-60 and from 71 and above were associated with higher risks of complications. Subset analysis on octogenarians revealed a 1.14-fold higher odds of mortality for every year of increasing age. Preoperative risk factors including open procedure, wound class, and American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) class were also associated with greater risks of mortality in octogenarians. Patients older than age 50 were at higher risk for postoperative complications, and mortality significantly increased for each decade past 60 years old in healthy individuals."

We conducted a retrospective case series of adult inpatients presenting with intestinal obstruction at our center during 2008-2014. We excluded patients without confirmed intestinal obstruction, those with obstruction secondary to a hernia, those who were treated for >24 hours at another hospital, and those with a previous encounter already included in the study. We measured inter-rater reliability using a weighted kappa coefficient. We used multivariable logistic regression, accounting for sampling weights, to assess the relationship of grades with complications, 30-day mortality, and 30-day readmission. Of 287 patients, 165 (58%) had grade I anatomic severity, 75 (26%) grade II, 23 (8%) grade III, 15 (5%) grade IV, and 9 (3%) grade V. Forty-six (16%) patients had a large bowel obstruction. There was substantial inter-rater agreement in grades [weighted kappa 0.69 (95% CI 0.47-0.91)]. Compared to grade I, grades III-V [OR 12.2 (95% CI 2.26-66.2)] but not grade II [OR 2.04 (95% CI 0.79-5.28)] were associated with increased risk of a complication. grade II [OR 7.92 (95% CI 3.27-19.2)], but not grades III-V [OR 3.56 (95% CI 0.30-42.5)] was associated with increased 30-day mortality.

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) operations are associated with substantial risk of morbidity including postoperative respiratory failure (PRF). While existing risk models are not widely utilized and rely on traditional statistical methods, application of machine learning (ML) in prediction of PRF following EGS remains unexplored. The present study aimed to develop ML-based prediction models for respiratory failure following EGS and compare their performance to traditional regression models using a nationally-representative cohort. Non-elective hospitalizations for EGS (appendectomy, cholecystectomy, repair of perforated ulcer, large or small bowel resection, lysis of adhesions) were identified in the 2016-18 Nationwide Readmissions Database. Factors associated with PRF were identified using ML techniques and logistic regression. The performance of XGBoost and logistic regression was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve and coefficient of determination (R2). The impact of PRF on mortality, length of stay (LOS) and hospitalization costs was secondarily assessed using generalized linear models. Of 1,003,703 hospitalizations, 8.8% developed PRF. The XGBoost model exhibited slightly superior discrimination compared to logistic regression (0.900, 95% CI 0.899-0.901 vs 0.894, 95% CI 0.862-0.896). Compared to logistic regression, XGBoost demonstrated excellent calibration across all risk levels (R2: 0.998 vs 0.962). Congestive heart failure, neurologic disorders, and coagulopathy were significantly associated with increased risk of PRF. After risk-adjustment, PRF was associated with 10-fold greater odds (95% confidence interval (CI) 9.8-11.1) of mortality and incremental increases in LOS by 3.1 days (95% CI 3.0-3.2) and $11,900 (95% CI 11,600-12,300) in costs. Logistic regression and XGBoost perform similarly in overall classification of PRF risk. However, due to superior calibration at extremes of risk, ML-based models may prove more useful in the clinical setting, where probabilities rather than classifications are desired."

Many older patients with EGS conditions have preexisting complex multimorbidity defined as the co-occurrence of at least 2 of 3 key domains: chronic conditions, functional limitations, and geriatric syndromes. The hypothesis was that specific multimorbidity domain combinations are associated with differential long-term mortality after patient admission with EGS conditions. To examine multimorbidity domain combinations associated with increased long-term mortality after patient admission with EGS conditions. This cohort study included community-dwelling participants aged 65 years and older from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey with linked Medicare data (January 1992 through December 2013) and admissions for diagnoses consistent with EGS conditions. Surveys on health and function from the year before EGS conditions were used to extract the 3 domains: chronic conditions, functional limitations, and geriatric syndromes. The number of domains present were summed to calculate a categorical rank: no multimorbidity (0 or 1), multimorbidity 2 (2 of the 3 domains present), and multimorbidity 3 (all 3 domains present). Whether operative treatment was provided during the admission was also identified. Data were cleaned and analyzed between January 16, 2020, and April 29, 2021. Mutually exclusive multimorbidity domain combinations (functional limitations and geriatric syndromes; functional limitations and chronic conditions; chronic conditions and geriatric syndromes; or functional limitations, geriatric syndromes, and chronic conditions). Time to death (up to 3 years from EGS conditions admission) in patients with multimorbidity combinations was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model and compared with those without multimorbidity; hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs are presented. Models were adjusted for age, sex, and operative treatment. Of 1960 patients (median [IQR] age, 79 [73-85] years; 1166 [59.5%] women), 383 (19.5%) had no multimorbidity, 829 (42.3%) had 2 multimorbidity domains, and 748 (38.2%) had all 3 domains present. A total of 376 (19.2%) were known to have died in the follow-up period, with a median (IQR) follow-up of 377 (138-621) days. Patients with chronic conditions and geriatric syndromes had a mortality risk similar to those without multimorbidity. However, all domain combinations with functional limitations were associated with significantly increased risk of death: functional limitations and chronic conditions (HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.03-3.23); functional limitations and geriatric syndromes (HR, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.37-6.18); and functional limitations, geriatric syndromes, and chronic conditions (HR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.49-2.89). Findings of this study suggest that a patient's baseline complex multimorbidity level efficiently identifies risk stratification groups for long-term survival. Functional limitations are rarely considered in risk stratification paradigms for older patients with EGS conditions compared with chronic conditions and geriatric syndromes. However, functional limitations may be the most important risk factor for long-term survival."

The aim of this study was to determine whether distance from hospital, or rurality, affects the mortality of emergency surgical patients admitted in Scotland. This was a retrospective population-level cohort study, including all EGS patients in Scotland aged 16 years or older admitted between 1998 and 2018. A multiple logistic regression model was created with inpatient mortality as the dependent variable, and distance from hospital (in quartiles) as the independent variable of interest, adjusting for age, sex, co-morbidity, deprivation, admission origin, diagnosis category, operative category, and year of admission. A second multiple logistic regression model was created with a six-fold Scottish Urban Rural Classification (SURC) as the independent variable of interest. Subgroup analyses evaluated patients who required operations, emergency laparotomy, and inter-hospital transfer. Data included 1 572 196 EGS admissions. Those living in the farthest distance quartile from hospital had lower odds of mortality than those in the closest quartile (OR 0.829, 95 per cent c.i. 0.798 to 0.861). Patients from the most rural areas (SURC 6) had higher odds of survival than those from the most urban (SURC 1) areas (OR 0.800, 95 per cent c.i. 0.755 to 0.848). Subgroup analysis showed that these effects were not observed for patients who required emergency laparotomy or transfer. EGS patients who live some distance from a hospital, or in rural areas, have lower odds of mortality, after adjusting for multiple covariates. Rural and distant patients undergoing emergency laparotomy have no survival advantage, and transferred patients have higher mortality."

We hypothesized that transfer origin of EGS patients impacts outcomes due to critical illness as indicated by higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and disease severity. We conducted a retrospective analysis of all adult patients transferred to our quaternary academic center's EGS service from 01/2014 to 12/2016. Only patients transferred to our hospital with EGS service as the primary service were eligible. We used multivariable logistic regression and probit analysis to measure the association of patients' clinical factors and their outcomes (mortality and survivors' hospital length of stay [HLOS]). We analyzed 708 patients, 280 (39%) from an ICU, 175 (25%) from an ED, and 253 (36%) from a surgical ward. Compared to ED patients, patients transferred from the ICU had higher mean (SD) SOFA score (5.7 (4.5) vs. 2.39 (2), P < 0.001), longer HLOS, and higher mortality. Transferring from ICU (OR 2.95, 95% CI 1.36-6.41, P=0.006), requiring laparotomy (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.04-3.70, P=0.039), and SOFA score (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.13-1.32, P < 0.001) were associated with higher mortality. At our academic center, patients transferred from an ICU were more critically ill and had longer HLOS and higher mortality. We identified SOFA score and a few conditions and diagnoses as associated with patients' outcomes. Further studies are needed to confirm our observation."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery is an emerging public health issue globally, with substantial healthcare burden. Interhospital transfer of critically unwell surgical patients has been the mainstay of bridging gaps in surgical coverage in regional and rural locations, despite evidence of greater morbidity and mortality. Delays in transfer invariably occurs and compounds the situation. Our aim was to examine the factors influencing interhospital transfer delays in emergency general surgical patients. A systematic search of PubMED and EmBase, was performed by two researchers from 2020 to 23rd Feb 2021, for English articles related to interhospital transfer delays in emergency general surgical patients, with an age of >16. Articles were critically appraised and data were extracted into a pre-specified data extraction form. No data was suitable for statistical analysis and a narrative synthesis was performed instead. Six relevant articles were identified from the search. All studies were retrospective cohort studies with moderate to high risk of bias. Lack of consultant surgeon input, after hours transfer, need for intensive care bed and poor transfer documentation may have a role in interhospital transfer delays. Patients with public health insurance, multiple comorbidities and non-emergency medical conditions experience longer transfer request time and may be at risk of precipitating interhospital transfer delays. Transfer delays are seen in transfers over longer distances. There is a paucity of knowledge on what and how factors influence interhospital transfer delays in emergency general surgical patients. Well-designed prospective cohort studies are required to bridge this knowledge gap."

    "abstract": "Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) achieves temporary hemorrhage control via aortic occlusion. Existing REBOA literature focuses on blunt trauma without a clearly defined role in penetrating trauma. This study compared clinical/injury data and outcomes after REBOA in penetrating vs blunt trauma. All patients in the Aortic Occlusion for Resuscitation in Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (AORTA) database, an observational American Association for the Surgery of Trauma dataset of trauma patients requiring aortic occlusion, who underwent REBOA were included (January 2014 through February 2021). Study groups were defined by mechanism: penetrating vs blunt. Subgroup analysis was performed of patients arriving with vital signs. Univariable/multivariable analyses compared injuries and outcomes. Seven hundred fifty-nine patients underwent REBOA: 152 (20%) penetrating and 607 (80%) blunt. Patients undergoing penetrating REBOA were less severely injured (injury severity score 25 vs 34; p < 0.001). The most common hemorrhage source was abdominal in penetrating REBOA (79%) and pelvic in blunt REBOA (31%; p = 0.002). Penetrating REBOA was more likely to occur in the operating room (36% vs 17%) and less likely in the emergency department (63% vs 81%; p < 0.001). Penetrating REBOA used more zone I balloon deployment (76% vs 64%) and less zone III (19% vs 34%; p = 0.001). Improved or stabilized hemodynamics were less frequent after penetrating REBOA (41% vs 62%, p < 0.001; 23% vs 41%, p < 0.001). On subgroup analysis of patients arriving alive, improvement or stabilization in hemodynamics was similar between groups (87% vs 86%, p = 0.388; 77% vs 72%, p = 0.273). Penetrating REBOA was not independently associated with mortality (odds ratio 1.253; p = 0.776). Despite lower injury severity, REBOA was significantly less likely to improve or stabilize hemodynamics after penetrating trauma. Among patients arriving alive, however, outcomes were comparable, suggesting that penetrating REBOA may be most beneficial among patients with vital signs. Because hemorrhage source, catheter insertion setting, and deployment zone varied significantly between groups, existing blunt REBOA data may not be appropriately extrapolated to penetrating trauma. Further study of REBOA as a means of aortic occlusion in penetrating trauma is needed."

    "abstract": "Patients undergoing emergency general surgery (EGS) and interhospital transfer (IHT) have increased mortality. Prior analyses of IHT have been limited by the inability to track post-discharge outcomes or have not included nonoperative EGS. We evaluated outcomes for IHT to our tertiary care facility compared with direct admission through the emergency department. Patients admitted directly (2015 to 2017) with a common EGS diagnosis (appendicitis, cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, small bowel obstruction, and diverticulitis) were propensity score matched to patients transferred from another acute care hospital. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed using patient characteristics, EGS diagnosis, comorbidities, and surgical critical care consultation. The primary outcome was inpatient mortality, and secondary outcomes were length of stay (LOS) 30-day hospital readmission. We identified 3,153 directly admitted patients and 1,272 IHT patients. IHT patients were older (mean 59.4 vs 51.5 years), had a higher Charlson comorbidity index (median 3 vs 1), White race (72% vs 49%), and BMI greater than 40 kg/m2 (11.6% vs 9.8%). After PSM, each group included 1,033 patients. IHT patients had a higher median LOS (5.5 days vs 3.8, p < 0.001), higher inpatient mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.69, p = 0.03), and more complications (OR 1.57, p < 0.001). The rate of post-discharge 30-day hospital encounters was similar (OR 1.08, p = 0.460). However, IHT patients had more emergency department encounters (OR 1.35, p = 0.04) and fewer observation-status readmissions (OR 0.53, p = 0.01). After PSM to reduce confounding variables, patients with common EGS diagnoses transferred to a tertiary care facility have increased inpatient morbidity and mortality. The increased morbidity and resource utilization for these patients extends beyond the index hospital stay."

    "abstract": "Although nearly 1 million older adults are admitted for emergency general surgery conditions yearly, the extent to which baseline health influences the development and treatment of emergency general surgery conditions is unknown. We evaluated baseline health and older patients with and without emergency general surgery conditions. We used the prospectively collected Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey with Medicare claims and 2 validated health frameworks: (1) Deficit Accumulation Frailty Score and (2) Complex Multimorbidity. Self-reported health and function items were used to derive pre-emergency general surgery conditions Deficit Accumulation Frailty Score and Complex Multimorbidity scores. Deficit Accumulation Frailty Score ranges from 0 (no frailty deficits) to 100 (all possible deficits present). Complex Multimorbidity is a 3-point categorical rank based on the presence of chronic conditions, functional limitations, and geriatric syndromes. Specific survey factors were also examined to determine association with development of emergency general surgery conditions or use of operative management. Of 54,417 individuals, 1,960 had emergency general surgery conditions (median age 79 [interquartile range 73-84]). Patients with emergency general surgery conditions had significantly higher Deficit Accumulation Frailty Score (19 [interquartile range 11-31] vs 14 [8-24]) and were more likely to be in the most severe Complex Multimorbidity category (38% vs 29%). Emergency general surgery conditions patients had higher proportions of nearly every health category, with the most striking differences in functional limitations. Patients who were treated nonoperatively had the poorest overall baseline health. Patients who developed emergency general surgery conditions had more severe health burden than patients who did not, particularly in functional status. Clinicians must better understand the interaction between baseline health vulnerability and emergency surgical disease to improve prognostication and ensure alignment of patient goals and treatment strategies."

    "abstract": "Older adults (OAs; ≥ 65 years) comprise a growing population in the United States and are anticipated to require an increasing number of emergency general surgery procedures (EGSPs). The aims of this study were to identify the frequency of EGSPs and compare cost of care in OAs managed at teaching hospitals (THs) vs nonteaching hospitals (NTHs). A retrospective review of data from the Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission database from 2009 to 2018 for OAs undergoing EGSPs was undertaken. Data collected included demographics, all patient-refined (APR)-severity of illness (SOI), APR-risk of mortality (ROM), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), EGSPs (partial colectomy (PC), small bowel resection, cholecystectomy, operative management of peptic ulcers, lysis of adhesions, appendectomy, and laparotomy, categorized hospital charges, length of stay (LOS), and mortality. Of the 55,401 OAs undergoing EGSPs in this study, 28,575 (51.6%) were treated at THs and 26,826 (48.4%) at NTHs. OAs at THs presented with greater APR-ROM (major 25.6% vs 24.9%, extreme 22.6% vs 22.0%, P=.01), and CCI (3.1±3 vs 2.7±2.8, P<.001) compared to NTHs. Lysis of adhesions, cholecystectomy, and PC comprised the overall most common EGSPs. Older adults at THs incurred comparatively higher median hospital charges for every EGSP due to increased room charges and LOS. Mortality was higher at THs (6.13% vs 5.33%, P<.001). While acuity of illness appears similar, cost of undergoing EGSPs for OAs is higher in THs vs NTHs due to increased LOS. Future work is warranted to determine and mitigate factors that increase LOS at THs."

    "abstract": "The US incarcerates more individuals than any other country. Prisoners are the only population guaranteed health care by the US constitution, but little is known about their surgical needs. This multicenter study aimed to describe the acute care surgery (ACS) needs of incarcerated individuals. Twelve centers prospectively identified incarcerated patients evaluated in their emergency department by the ACS service. Centers collected diagnosis, treatment, and complications from chart review. Patients were classified as either emergency general surgery (EGS) patients or trauma patients and their characteristics and outcomes were investigated. Poisson regression accounting for clustering by center was used to calculate the relative risk (RR) of readmission, representation within 90 days, and failure to follow-up as an outpatient within 90 days for each cohort. More than 12 months, ACS services evaluated 943 patients, 726 (80.3%) from jail, 156 (17.3%) from prison, and 22 (2.4%) from other facilities. Most were men (89.7%) with a median age of 35 years (interquartile range, 27-47). Trauma patients comprised 54.4% (n = 513) of the cohort. Admission rates were similar for trauma (61.5%) and EGS patients (60.2%). Head injuries and facial fractures were the most common injuries, while infections were the most common EGS diagnosis. Self-harm resulted in 102 trauma evaluations (19.9%). Self-inflicted injuries were associated with increased risk of readmission (RR, 4.3; 95% confidence interval, 3.02-6.13) and reevaluation within 90 days (RR, 4.96; 95% confidence interval, 3.07-8.01). Incarcerated patients who present with a range of trauma and EGS conditions frequently require admission, and follow-up after hospitalization was low at the treating center. Poor follow-up coupled with high rates of assault, self-harm, mental health, and substance use disorders highlight the vulnerability of this population. Hospital and correctional facility interventions are needed to decrease self-inflicted injuries and assaults while incarcerated. Prognostic and epidemiological, Level III."

In most cases, the proximal suture line is involved. We herein report a rare case in which the fistula formed between the suture line of inferior mesenteric artery reimplantation and the jejunum. An 82-year-old man was transferred to our hospital due to hematemesis with severe hypovolemic shock. Although he fell into cardiopulmonary arrest, immediate resuscitation achieved return of spontaneous circulation. As his surgical history of aortic reconstruction and computed tomography findings suggested potential secondary aortoenteric fistula, emergency surgery was carried out. The anastomosis between the inferior mesenteric artery and aortic graft was communicating with the jejunum. Partial jejunal resection was undertaken, and the aortic graft was replaced. The anastomosis between the inferior mesenteric artery and aortic graft in the previous aortic replacement can become the site of secondary aortoenteric fistula."

The goal of this study was to describe our initial experience at a safety net hospital with acute care surgeon-performed laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) when CD is confirmed at the time of LC. We hypothesized that this strategy would result in reduced length of stay, and lower charges compared to ERCP. This was a retrospective case control study over a 2 year period matching LCBDE to ERCP (1:3) among a cohort of patients with CD confirmed at first procedure. Data is reported as median (interquartile range). Statistical analysis used the Kruskal-Wallis and Chi-squared tests with 95% confidence interval. Demographics, preoperative WBC, and bilirubin were similar between the LCBDE (n = 14) and ERCP (n = 37) groups. Success rate for LCBDE was 11/14 (79%), and the remaining three subjects successfully underwent post-operative ERCP. Overall complication rate for the LCBDE group was 1/14 (7%) and the readmission rate was 0/14 (0%). Length of stay for LCBDE vs ERCP was 2.5 (1-3) vs 5 (3-5) days (p < 0.01). Charges during initial hospitalization was $35858 ($26587-$49570) vs $48662 ($36018-$57106) (p = 0.05). LCBDE by acute care surgeons at the time of LC was associated with lower charges, reduced hospital length of stay, low rates of post-operative complications, and no readmissions."

We used local 2012-2017 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) data to study colectomy patients, examining associations between SVI and postoperative outcomes. We included 976 patients from five hospitals. High SVI (>75th percentile) was associated with increased postoperative morbidity on unadjusted analysis (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.35-2.52, p < 0.001); this association persisted after adjusting for demographics and comorbidities (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.15-2.31, p = 0.005). The association with SVI was not significant after adjusting for perioperative risk modifiers such as emergent presentation (OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.95-1.98, p = 0.10). High social vulnerability is associated with increased postoperative complications. This effect appears mediated by perioperative risk factors, suggesting potential to improve outcomes by facilitating timely surgical intervention."

It is suspected that the virus has had a detrimental effect on perioperative morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these outcomes in emergency general surgical patients. Emergency general surgical admissions were included in this retrospective cohort study in one of the COVID-19 hotspots in the South East of England. The primary outcome was the 30-day mortality rate. Secondary outcomes included the length of stay in hospital, complication rate and severity grade and admission rates to the ITU. Of 123 patients, COVID-19 was detected in 12.2%. Testing was not carried out in 26%. When comparing COVID-positive to COVID-negative patients, the mean age was 71.8 + 8.8 vs. 50.7 + 5.7, respectively, and female patients accounted for 40.0 vs. 52.6%. The 30-day mortality rate was 26.7 vs. 3.9 (OR 6.49, p = 0.02), respectively. The length of stay in hospital was 20.5 + 22.2 vs. 7.7 + 9.8 (p < 0.01), the rate of complications was 80.0 vs. 23.7 (OR 12.9, p < 0.01), and the rate of admission to the ITU was 33.3 vs. 7.9% (OR 5.83, p = 0.01).

Periods of fluctuation in function may represent opportunities to intervene to prevent further decline. Our objective was to describe the functional trajectories of older adults following EGS admission. This was a population-based retrospective cohort study of all independent, community-dwelling older adults (age ≥65 years) in Ontario with an EGS admission (2006-2016). A multistate model was used to examine patients' functional trajectories over the 5 years following discharge. Patients were followed as they transitioned back and forth between functional independence, use of chronic home care (in-home assistance for personal care, homemaking, or medical care for at least 90 days), nursing home admission, and death. We identified 78,820 older adults with an EGS admission (mean age, 77 years; 53% female). In the 5 years following admission, 32% (n = 24,928) required new chronic home care, 21% (n = 5,249) of whom had two or more episodes of chronic home care separated by periods of independence. The average time spent in chronic home care was 11 months, and 50% (n = 12,679) of chronic home care episodes ended with a return to independence. For patients requiring chronic home care at any time, the probability of returning to independent living during the subsequent 5 years ranged from 36% to 43% annually. Not all is lost for older adults who experience functional decline following EGS admission. Half of those who require chronic home care will recover to independence, and one-third will have a durable recovery, remaining independent after 5 years. Fluctuations in function in the years following EGS may represent a unique opportunity for interventions to promote rehabilitation and recovery among older adults.

The purpose of this study was to identify the current FTR rate in emergency general surgery (EGS) centres across Canada. We hypothesized that substantial variability exists in FTR rates across centres. In this multicentre retrospective cohort study, we performed a secondary analysis of data from a previous study designed to evaluate operative intervention for nonappendiceal, nonbiliary disease by 6 EGS services across Canada (1 in British Columbia, 1 in Alberta, 3 in Ontario and 1 in Nova Scotia). Patients underwent surgery between Jan. 1 and Dec. 31, 2014. We conducted univariate analyses to compare patients with and without complications. We performed a sensitivity analysis examining the mortality rate after serious complications (Clavien-Dindo score 3 or 4) that required a surgical intervention or specialized care (e.g., admission to intensive care unit). A total of 2595 patients were included in the study cohort. Of the 206 patients who died within 30 days, 145 (70.4%) experienced a complication before their death. Overall, the mortality rate after any surgical complication (i.e., FTR) was 16.0%. Ranking of sites by the traditional outcomes of complication and mortality rates differed from the ranking when FTR rate was included in the assessment. There was variability in FTR rates across EGS services in Canada, which suggests that there is opportunity for ongoing quality-improvement efforts. This study provides FTR benchmarking data for Canadian EGS services. On a proposé que le risque de décès après une complication postopératoire — appelé « échec de sauvetage » — pourrait s’avérer une mesure plus pertinente de la qualité du système de santé que les indicateurs comparatifs traditionnels, comme les taux de complications et de mortalité. Cette étude visait à déterminer le taux réel d’échec de sauvetage dans les centres de chirurgies générales d’urgence (CGU) au Canada. Notre hypothèse était que ce taux varie grandement d’un centre à l’autre. Dans le cadre de cette étude de cohorte rétrospective multicentrique, nous avons réalisé une analyse secondaire des données issues d’une étude antérieure, dont l’objectif était d’évaluer les interventions chirurgicales relatives à des atteintes ne touchant ni l’appendice ni la vésicule biliaire effectuées par 6 centres de CGU au Canada (1 en Colombie-Britannique, 1 en Alberta, 3 en Ontario et 1 en Nouvelle-Écosse). Ces interventions ont eu lieu du 1er janvier au 31 décembre 2014. Nous avons comparé les 2 catégories de patients — avec complications et sans complications — au moyen d’analyses univariées. Nous avons aussi mené une analyse de sensibilité concernant le taux de mortalité après des complications graves (3 ou 4 selon la classification de Clavien–Dindo) qui ont nécessité une intervention chirurgicale ou des soins spécialisés (par exemple, une admission en soins intensifs). L’étude a porté sur un total de 2595 patients. Sur les 206 patients décédés dans les 30 jours, 145 (70,4 %) ont eu une complication avant leur décès. Globalement, le taux de mortalité après une complication postopératoire (soit le taux d’échec de sauvetage) était de 16,0 %. Le classement des centres avec les indicateurs traditionnels (taux de complications et de mortalité) n’était pas le même une fois pris en compte le taux d’échec de sauvetage. Le taux d’échec de sauvetage varie d’un centre de CGU à l’autre au pays, ce qui laisse croire qu’une amélioration continue de la qualité reste possible. Cette étude fournit des données de référence sur les taux d’échec de sauvetage aux centres de CGU au Canada."

Our aim was to understand the association between COVID-19 positivity rates and patient presentation with EGS diagnoses during the COVID pandemic compared to historical controls. In this cohort study, we identified patients ≥ 18 years who presented to an urgent care, freestanding ED, or acute care hospital in a regional health system with selected EGS diagnoses during the pandemic (March 17, 2020 to February 17, 2021) and compared them to a pre-pandemic cohort (March 17, 2019 to February 17, 2020). Outcomes of interest were number of EGS-related visits per month, length of stay (LOS), 30-day mortality and 30-day readmission. There were 7908 patients in the pre-pandemic and 6771 in the pandemic cohort. The most common diagnoses in both were diverticulitis (29.6%), small bowel obstruction (28.8%), and appendicitis (20.8%). The lowest relative volume of EGS patients was seen in the first two months of the pandemic period (29% and 40% decrease). A higher percentage of patients were managed at a freestanding ED (9.6% vs. 8.1%) and patients who were admitted were more likely to be managed at a smaller hospital during the pandemic. Rates of surgical intervention were not different. There was no difference in use of ICU, ventilator requirement, or LOS. Higher 30-day readmission and lower 30-day mortality were seen in the pandemic cohort. In the setting of the COVID pandemic, there was a decrease in visits with EGS diagnoses. The increase in visits managed at freestanding ED may reflect resources dedicated to supporting outpatient non-operative management and lack of bed availability during COVID surges. There was no evidence of a rebound in EGS case volume or substantial increase in severity of disease after a surge declined."

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the dynamics of healthcare in the USA. In early 2020, most states issued orders to stop non-emergent elective surgeries. This contracted the overall revenue generated by the hospital systems. The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on volume has not been well studied but effects on surgeon professional fees generated remains unexplored. The goal of this study was to assess if COVID-19 pandemic has affected surgeon professional fees and revenues generated from emergency general surgeries. This is a retrospective review to compare surgical case volume in 2019 and 2020. We obtained our data from a tertiary care referral center database. Data were collected from February to April of 2019 and 2020, corresponding to the duration of statewide ban on non-emergent surgical cases. We used the most reported current procedural terminology (CPT) Code for each surgical procedure to calculate the surgeon professional fees generated. We calculated the percentage difference in surgeon professional fees between 2019 and 2020 for comparison. There was a statistically significant decrease in daily emergent operations between 2019 and 2020 time periods (6.13/day vs 4.64/day). There was a statistically significant decrease in hospital admissions for appendicitis, cholecystitis, diverticulitis, skin and soft tissue infections, small bowel obstruction and GI bleed. Additionally, a statistically significant decrease in number of appendectomy, cholecystectomy, sigmoid colectomy with anastomosis, small bowel resection, operation for incarcerated and reducible hernia procedures was observed. There is a decline in surgeon professional fees generated in 2020 compared to 2019 for all emergent surgeries. When compared to 2019, we observed an increase of 238 more inquests in February to April of 2020, which is the same time period when we noticed a significant decrease in hospital admissions and procedures for emergency general surgery. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted surgical case volumes in 2020 compared to 2019. This includes both emergent and non-emergent cases. There is a need for more broad cost analysis which considers hospital expenditures and cost benefit analysis."

We hypothesized that patients with IAI managed with OA rather than closed abdomen (CA) would have higher rates of secondary infections (SIs) independent of the duration of the antibiotic treatment. This was an observational, prospective, multicenter, international study of patients with IAI requiring laparotomy for source control. Demographic and antibiotic duration values were collected. Primary outcomes were SI (surgical site, bloodstream, pneumonia, urinary tract) and mortality. Statistical analysis included ANOVA, chi-square/Fisher's exact test, and logistic regression. Twenty-one centers contributed 752 patients. The average age was 59.6 years, 43.6% were women, and 43.9% were managed with OA. Overall mortality was 16.1%, with higher rates among OA patients (31.6% vs 4.4%, p < 0.001). OA patients had higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (4.7 vs 1.8, p < 0.001), American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (3.6 vs 2.7, p < 0.001), and APACHE II scores (16.1 vs 9.4, p < 0.001). The mean duration of antibiotics was 6.5 days (8.0 OA vs 5.4 CA, p < 0.001). A total of 179 (23.8%) patients developed SI (33.1% OA vs 16.8% CA, p < 0.001). Longer antibiotic duration was associated with increased rates of SI: 1 to 2 days, 15.8%; 3 to 5 days, 20.4%; 6 to 14 days, 26.6%; and more than 14 days, 46.8% (p < 0.001). Patients with IAI managed with OA had higher rates of SI and increased mortality compared with CA. A prolonged duration of antibiotics was associated with increased rates of SI.

    "abstract": "The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) has developed a grading system for emergency general surgery (EGS) conditions. We sought to validate the AAST EGS grades for patients undergoing urgent/emergent colorectal resection. Patients enrolled in the \"Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma Multicenter Colorectal Resection in EGS-to anastomose or not to anastomose\" study undergoing urgent/emergent surgery for obstruction, ischemia, or diverticulitis were included. Baseline demographics, comorbidity severity as defined by Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), procedure type, and AAST grade were prospectively collected. Outcomes included length of stay (LOS) in-hospital mortality, and surgical complications (superficial/deep/organ-space surgical site infection, anastomotic leak, stoma complication, fascial dehiscence, and need for further intervention). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to describe outcomes and risk factors for surgical complication or mortality. There were 367 patients, with a mean (± SD) age of 62 ± 15 years. 39% were women. The median interquartile range (IQR) CCI was 4 (2-6). Overall, the pathologies encompassed the following AAST EGS grades: I (17, 5%), II (54, 15%), III (115, 31%), IV (95, 26%), and V (86, 23%). Management included laparoscopic (24, 7%), open (319, 87%), and laparoscopy converted to laparotomy (24, 6%). Higher AAST grade was associated with laparotomy (P = .01). The median LOS was 13 days (8-22). At least 1 surgical complication occurred in 33% of patients and the mortality rate was 14%. Development of at least 1 surgical complication, need for unplanned intervention, mortality, and increased LOS were associated with increasing AAST severity grade. On multivariable analysis, factors predictive of in-hospital mortality included AAST organ grade, CCI, and preoperative vasopressor use (odds ratio (OR) 1.9, 1.6, 3.1, respectively). The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma emergency general surgery grade was also associated with the development of at least 1 surgical complication (OR 2.5), while CCI, preoperative vasopressor use, respiratory failure, and pneumoperitoneum were not. The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma emergency general surgery grading systems display construct validity for mortality and surgical complications after urgent/emergent colorectal resection. These results support incorporation of AAST EGS grades for quality benchmarking and surgical outcomes research."

    "abstract": "During the COVID-19 surge in Taiwan, the Far East Memorial Hospital established a system including a centralized quarantine unit and triage admission protocol to facilitate acute care surgical inpatient services, prevent nosocomial COVID-19 infection and maintain the efficiency and quality of health care service during the pandemics. This retrospective cohort study included patients undergoing acute care surgery. The triage admission protocol was based on rapid antigen tests, Liat® PCR and RT-PCT tests. Type of surgical procedure, patient characteristics, and efficacy indices of the centralized quarantine unit and emergency department (ED) were collected and analyzed before (Phase I: May 11 to July 2, 2021) and after (Phase II: July 3 to July 31, 2021) the system started. A total of 287 patients (105 in Phase I and 182 in Phase II) were enrolled. Nosocomial COVID-19 infection occur in 27 patients in phase I but zero in phase II. More patients received traumatological, orthopedic, and neurologic surgeries in phase II than in phase I. The patients' surgical risk classification, median total hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, intraoperative blood loss, operation time, and the number of patients requiring postoperative ICU care were similar in both groups. The duration of ED stay and waiting time for acute care surgery were longer in Phase II (397 vs. 532 minutes, p < 0.0001). The duration of ED stay was positively correlated with the number of surgical patients visiting the ED (median = 66 patients, Spearman's ρ = 0.207) and the occupancy ratio in the centralized quarantine unit on that day (median = 90.63%, Spearman's ρ = 0.191). The triage admission protocol provided resilient quarantine needs and sustainable acute care surgical services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The efficiency was related to the number of medical staff dedicated to the centralized quarantine unit and number of surgical patients visited in ED."

Alternative post-operative pain control with non-opioid pharmaceuticals can help counteract this effect. We investigated a non-opioid pain management protocol following emergent laparoscopic appendectomy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Our tertiary referral center performed a prospective observational feasibility study of patients from October 2019 to 2020 who underwent emergent laparoscopic appendectomies and cholecystectomies. Patients aged 18-65 with no prior history of chronic pain or opioid abuse, no contraindications to taking acetaminophen and ibuprofen, and Glomerular Filtration Rate > 60 ml/min were included. Counseling was provided about non-narcotic pain control. Patients were not prescribed narcotics at discharge and were instead prescribed ibuprofen and acetaminophen. Patients were surveyed at their 2-week post-operative appointment to assess pain control and other patient-reported outcomes, including quality of life (QOL). Fifty-one patients met the inclusion criteria and completed the postoperative survey. Thirty-two were female (63%), average age 38, and BMI 30.4. 30 (59%) underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for acute non-perforated appendicitis and 21 (41%) underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis or symptomatic cholelithiasis. 88% of patients felt satisfied or neutral with their post-operative pain control at discharge. After 2 weeks, 34 patients (66.7%) rated QOL as high, 17 (33.3%) rated QOL as moderate, and none rated QOL as poor. Fascial suture was not associated with poor outcomes. Anxiety, depression, alcohol use, and prior abdominal surgery were not associated with increased need for post-operative narcotics. There were no significant differences between appendectomy and cholecystectomy in satisfaction with pain control or QOL (p > 0.05). Patients undergoing surgery have an increased risk of developing an opioid disorder. The NOpioid Project demonstrated a non-narcotic multimodal pain regimen can be effectively adopted in the post-operative period after an emergent laparoscopic appendectomy or emergent laparoscopic cholecystectomy."

To obviate lapses in documentation, an EGS tertiary survey (EGS-TS) was developed to enable early recognition of relevant omissions in documentation and clinical findings. We theorized that the creation of the EGS-TS would promote more thorough clinical documentation. A prospective observational study was performed utilizing an EGS-TS from February 2019 through May 2019. The EGS-TS included physical exam, medication reconciliation, analysis of documentation for accuracy, and review of diagnostic imaging for incidental findings. There were 139 EGS admissions during the study period and 108 (78%) received an EGS-TS. Of those who received the EGS-TS, incorrect medication reconciliations (72%), incidental findings (12%), undocumented wounds (11%), and undocumented indwelling catheters were identified (6%). Implementation of an EGS-TS triggers a detailed evaluation and reveals opportunities for education, improved adherence to documentation standards, and further research that may guide quality improvement initiatives."

In this study, we compared the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) of our population by appendicitis severity (uncomplicated appendicitis [UA] versus CA). We hypothesized that SVI would be similar between patients with UA and CA presenting to our institution, a safety-net hospital in a state with high healthcare insurance coverage. We included all patients at our hospital aged 18 y and older who underwent appendectomy for acute appendicitis between 2012 and 2016. SVI values were determined based on the 2010 census data using ArcMap software. We used nonparametric univariate statistics to compare the SVI of patients with CA versus UA and multivariable regression to model the likelihood of operative CA. A total of 997 patients met inclusion criteria, of which 177 had CA. The median composite SVI score for patients with CA was lower than for patients with UA (80% versus 83%, P = 0.004). UA was associated with higher socioeconomic (83% versus 80%, P = 0.007), household/disability (68% versus 55%, P = 0.037), and minority/language SVI scores (91% versus 89%, P = 0.037). On multivariable analysis controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, insurance status, relevant comorbidities, and chronicity of symptoms, there was an inverse association between SVI and the likelihood of CA (odds ratio 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.4-0.87, P = 0.008). In the setting of high healthcare insurance and a medical center experienced in caring for vulnerable populations, patients presenting with UA have a higher composite SVI, and thus greater social vulnerability, than patients presenting with CA."

    "abstract": "Complex enteric fistulas (CEF) represent general surgeons' nightmare. This paper aims to explore the impact on failure-to-rescue (FTR) rate of a standardised and integrated surgical and critical care step-up approach. This was a retrospective observational cohort study. Patients treated for CEF from 2009 to 2019 at Niguarda Hospital were included. Each patient was approached following a three-step approach: study phase, sepsis control and strategy definition phase, and surgical rescue phase. Sixteen patients were treated for CEF. Seven fistulas were classified as complex entero-cutaneous (ECF) and nine as entero-atmospheric fistula (EAF). Median number of surgical procedures for fistula control before definitive surgical attempt was 11 (IQR 2-33.5). The median time from culprit surgery and the first access at Niguarda Hospital to definitive surgical attempt were 279 days (IQR 231-409) and 120 days (IQR 34-231), respectively. Median ICU LOS was 71 days (IQR 28-101), and effective hospital LOS was 117 days, (IQR 69.5-188.8). Three patients (18.75%) experienced spontaneous fistula closure after conversion to simple ECF, whereas 13 (81.25%) underwent definitive surgery for fistula takedown. Surgical rescue was possible in nine patients. Nine patients underwent multiple postoperative revision for surgical complications. Four patients failed to be rescued. An integrated step-up rescue strategy is crucial to standardise the approach to CEF and go beyond the basic surgical rescue procedure. The definition of FTR is dependent from the examined population. CEF patients are a unique cluster of emergency general surgery patients who may need a tailored definition of FTR considering the burden of postoperative events influencing their outcome."

This retrospective review compares outcomes for CC resections on the ACS service to the surgical oncology and colorectal services (SO/CRS). Retrospective review was performed for CC operations between 2014 and 2019. Data for margin status, cancer stage, number of lymph nodes dissected, time to medical oncology follow-up, and time to initiation of chemotherapy were collected. Patients with curative resection, who chose comfort care, presented on alternative services or with non-CC indications as well as those were lost to follow-up were excluded. 36 ACS patients and 269 SO/CRS patients underwent CC resections. Most ACS patients presented emergently compared to the SO/CC group (83.3% vs 1%, P < .05) as well as with more advanced tumor stage. There were no statistically significant differences for presence of metastatic disease, number of lymph nodes obtained, or time to post-surgical care (in days) and chemotherapy initiation (in days). 3 (8%) EGS patients had positive margins compared to 6 (2%) CRS/SO patients due to the presence of perforated tumors in the ACS group (p < .05). There were no statistically significant differences in 30- day or 1-year mortality despite the emergent presentation of the ACS patients. These findings suggest that despite emergent presentation and advanced disease burden, ACS surgeons provide quality care to CC patients, both in the operating room and in coordination of care."

The aim of this study was to develop global guidelines for EGS that are applicable across all hospitals and health systems. A systematic review and thematic analysis were performed to identify recommendations relating to undifferentiated EGS. Those deemed relevant across all resource settings by an international guideline development panel were included in a four-round Delphi prioritization process and are reported according to International Standards for Clinical Practice Guidelines. The final recommendations were included as essential (baseline measures that should be implemented as a priority) or desirable (some hospitals may lack relevant resources at present but should plan for future implementation). After thematic analysis of 38 guidelines with 1396 unique recommendations, 68 recommendations were included in round 1 voting (410 respondents (219 from LMICs)). The final guidelines included eight essential, one desirable, and three critically unwell patient-specific recommendations. Preoperative recommendations included guidance on timely transfers, CT scan pathways, handovers, and discussion with senior surgeons. Perioperative recommendations included surgical safety checklists and recovery room monitoring. Postoperative recommendations included early-warning scores, discharge plans, and morbidity meetings. Recommendations for critically unwell patients included prioritization for theatre, senior team supervision, and high-level postoperative care. This pragmatic and representative process created evidence-based global guidelines for EGS that are suitable for resource limited environments around the world."

    "abstract": "Gastric adenocarcinoma is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide and in the United States, and can present emergently with upper GI hemorrhage, obstruction, or perforation. Few large studies have examined how emergency surgery for gastric cancer affects patient outcomes. All patients from National Surgical Quality Improvement Program with gastric adenocarcinoma from 2005 to 2017 were examined retrospectively. Univariate and multivariate analysis of patient factors and perioperative outcomes was performed. P-values < .05 were significant. Of 4663 total patients, 115 had emergency surgery and 4548 had elective surgery. Emergency surgery patients were more likely to be non-white, underweight, higher ASA class, require a preoperative blood transfusion, and were less likely to be functionally independent. Multivariate analysis demonstrates an increased likelihood of unplanned intubation, prolonged ventilation, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). There are no significant differences in mortality, reoperation, or infection when comparing emergent surgery for gastric cancer and elective surgery; however, there is an increased risk of reintubation, prolonged intubation, and DVT in patients undergoing emergent surgery. Patients requiring emergent surgery have more comorbidities, higher blood transfusion requirements, and worse preoperative functional status, and this study demonstrates that they also have worse perioperative outcomes. Previous studies have shown that long-term oncologic outcomes are worse for patients undergoing urgent surgery, and this study shows that perioperative outcomes are also somewhat worse. Thus, definitive surgery performed on a patient who presents emergently with gastric cancer should be considered but may come at the cost of increased perioperative respiratory complications, DVTs, and worse oncologic outcomes."

All patients 17 years or older and diagnosed preoperatively with COVID-19 between February and July 2020 were included. Emergency general surgery was defined as the urgent/emergent performance of appendectomy, cholecystectomy, or laparotomy. The main outcomes were 30-day mortality and 30-day pulmonary complications (a composite of acute respiratory distress syndrome, unexpected mechanical ventilation, or pneumonia). Planned subgroup analyses were performed based on presence of preoperative COVID-related respiratory findings (e.g., cough, dyspnea, need for oxygen therapy, chest radiology abnormality). A total of 1,045 patients were included, of which 40.1% were female and 50.0% were older than 50 years; 461 (44.1%), 145 (13.9%), and 439 (42.0%) underwent appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and laparotomy, respectively. The overall mortality rate was 15.1% (158 of 1,045 patients), and the overall pulmonary complication rate was 32.9% (344 of 1,045 patients); in the subgroup of laparotomy patients, the rates were 30.6% (134 of 438 patients) and 59.2% (260 of 439 patients), respectively. Subgroup analyses found mortality and pulmonary complication risk to be especially increased in patients with preoperative respiratory findings. COVID-19 patients undergoing EGS have significantly high rates of mortality and pulmonary complications, but the risk is most pronounced in those with preoperative respiratory findings.

Past efforts have been limited by difficulties in identifying EGS patients within institutions and labor-intensive approaches to data capture. Thus, we created an automated electronic health record (EHR)-linked registry for EGS. We built a registry within the Epic EHR at University of California San Diego for the EGS service. Existing EHR labels that identified patients seen by the EGS team were used to create our automated inclusion rules. Registry validation was performed using a retrospective cohort of EGS patients in a 30-month period and a 1-month prospective cohort. We created quality metrics that are updated and reported back to clinical teams in real time and obtained aggregate data to identify QI and research opportunities. A key metric tracked is clinic schedule rate, as we care that discontinuity postdischarge for the EGS population remains a challenge. Our registry captured 1,992 patient encounters with 1,717 unique patients in the 30-month period. It had a false-positive EGS detection rate of 1.8%. In our 1-month prospective cohort, it had a false-positive EGS detection rate of 0% and sensitivity of 85%. For quality metrics analysis, we found that EGS patients who were seen as consults had significantly lower clinic schedule rates on discharge compared with those who were admitted to the EGS service (85% vs. 60.7%, p < 0.001). An EHR-linked EGS registry can reliably conduct capture data automatically and support QI and research. Prognostic and epidemiological, level III."

    "abstract": "Background and objective There is a paucity of medical literature describing the preparedness of hospital institutions to withstand the population effects of a pandemic. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has had a global impact on all facets of medicine, which has ultimately affected the medical community in a significant manner. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of research regarding the effects of COVID-19 on trauma and acute care surgery injury and admission rates. We conducted this study to examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on both pediatric and adult trauma admissions, injury types, and mechanisms of injury. Materials and methods Data from the Trauma Registry was extracted for all adult (>15 years) and pediatric (<15 years) patients who consulted trauma surgery, acute care surgery, or orthopedic surgery at our center in the year immediately prior to the pandemic (March 1, 2019-February 29, 2020) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1, 2020-February 28, 2021). Patient demographics, cause of injury, injury type and mechanism, and procedures performed were recorded. Results We documented a 4.2% increase in adult encounters compared to the preceding year. There was a significant difference in the distribution of mechanism of injury of adult patients between the two time periods, with the most changes seen in motor-vehicle auto, gunshot, and other vehicle injuries. However, no significant difference was seen in trauma type or intent (assault, self-inflicted, unintentional). Pediatric encounters increased by 6.4% during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Overall, there was no detectable association between the distribution of encounters by the mechanism of injury and the time period for pediatric encounters. Conclusion This retrospective review of trauma encounters through both pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods outlines the differences in factors such as demographics, injury mechanisms, and injury types between the two time periods. Overall, we expected a decrease in orthopedic-related trauma admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, there was actually an increase of 4.1% in adult encounters and that of 6.4% in pediatric encounters. Our study lays out possible trends in injury patterns that can be correlated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown period. This information is useful for the healthcare system in that it demonstrates that resources should not be cut down or removed from surgical specialties. At level I facilities, resources need to be allocated for and continued to be provided to emergency rooms and operative services, including supplies and staffing. These departments need to be well-equipped to handle an increased number of trauma patients."

    "abstract": "Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) are responsible for a significant economic burden as well as intangible costs suffered by the patient, with up to 60% deemed preventable. Colorectal patients are disproportionally affected by SSI due the risk of wound contamination with bowel content. We aimed to reduce the rate of superficial SSI after elective colorectal surgery using a bundle of evidence-based interventions. An SSI prevention bundle was implemented in elective colorectal surgery, comprised of triclosan-coated sutures, 2% chlorhexidine skin preparation and use of warmed carbon dioxide (CO2) during laparoscopic procedures. The SSI reduction strategy was prospectively implemented and compared with historical controls. Our primary outcome measure was the overall rate of superficial SSI. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention criteria, which use microbiological evidence in conjunction with clinical features were used as the definition of SSI. The overall SSI rate was 27.4% in the pre-bundle group (N = 208) and 12.5% in the patients who received the SSI prevention bundle (N = 184) (adjusted odds ratio 0.38; confidence interval 0.21-0.67; P<0.001). The median time to SSI diagnosis was postoperative day 8. Overall patient length of stay (LOS) was unchanged from six days at baseline following implementation of the bundle. We have shown successful implementation of an SSI prevention bundle which has reduced superficial SSI rate. We recommend this SSI prevention bundle becomes standard practice in elective colorectal surgery and plan to extend the bundle to emergency general surgery."

The questionnaire was developed by a panel of 11 international experts and approved by the WSES steering committee. 200 participants answered the survey, 32 were females (16%). 172 (86%) surgeons thought that AI will improve acute care surgery. Fifty surgeons (25%) were trained, robotic surgeons and can perform it. Only 19 (9.5%) were currently performing it. 126 (63%) surgeons do not have a robotic system in their institution, and for those who have it, it was mainly used for elective surgery. Only 100 surgeons (50%) were able to define different AI terminology. Participants thought that AI is useful to support training and education (61.5%), perioperative decision making (59.5%), and surgical vision (53%) in emergency surgery. There was no statistically significant difference between males and females in ability, interest in training or expectations of AI (p values 0.91, 0.82, and 0.28, respectively, Mann-Whitney U test). Ability was significantly correlated with interest and expectations (p < 0.0001 Pearson rank correlation, rho 0.42 and 0.47, respectively) but not with experience (p = 0.9, rho - 0.01). The implementation of artificial intelligence in the emergency and trauma setting is still in an early phase. The support of emergency and trauma surgeons is essential for the progress of AI in their setting which can be augmented by proper research and training programs in this area."

Frailty scores, used to estimate the physiologic status of an individual, are key to identifying those most at risk for injury. Global health measures such as the Veterans RAND 12 Item Health Survey (VR-12) are quality of life measures that assess older adults' overall perception of their health and may serve as a useful adjunct when predicting frailty. Herein, we evaluated whether components of the VR-12 correlated with worse frailty scores over time. Older adults (≥65) admitted to burn, trauma, or emergency general surgery services were prospectively enrolled. Demographics, frailty determined using the Trauma Specific Frailty Index (TSFI), and VR-12 surveys were collected at enrollment and 3, 6, 9, and 12-month follow-ups. A physical component score (PCS) and mental component score (MCS) was produced by VR-12 surveys for comparison purposes. Fifty-eight patients were enrolled, of which 8 died. No significant changes in PCS (p = 0.25) and MCS (p = 0.56) were observed over time. PCS (p = 0.97) and MCS (p = 0.78) at enrollment did not predict mortality. PCS (OR = 0.894 [0.84-0.95], p = 0.0004) and age (OR = 1.113 [1.012-1.223], p = 0.03) independently predicted enrollment frailty. These global measures of health could be utilized in lieu or in addition to frailty scores when assessing patients in the setting of acute injury. Studies are warranted to confirm this association."

    "abstract": "The impact of interhospital transfer on outcomes of patients undergoing emergency general surgery (EGS) procedures is incompletely studied. We set out to determine if transfer before definitive surgical care leads to worse outcomes in EGS patients. Using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project database (2013-2019), a retrospective cohort study was conducted including nine surgical procedures encompassing 80% of the burden of EGS diseases, performed on an urgent/emergent basis. The procedures were classified as low risk (open and laparoscopic appendectomy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy) and high risk (open cholecystectomy, laparoscopic and open colectomy, lysis of adhesions, perforated ulcer repair, small bowel resection, and exploratory laparotomy). Time to surgery was recorded in days. The impact of interhospital transfer on outcomes (mortality, major complications, 30-day reoperations, and 30-day readmissions) and length of stay, according to procedure risk and time to surgery, were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression and inverse probability treatment of the weighting with treatment effect in the treated. A total of 329,613 patients were included in the study (284,783 direct admission and 44,830 transfers). Adjusted mortality (3.1% vs. 10.4%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.28; p < 0.001), major complications (6.7% vs. 18.9%; AOR, 1.39; p < 0.001), 30-day reoperations (3.1% vs. 6.4%; AOR, 1.22; p < 0.001), and length of stay (2 vs. 5) were higher in transferred patients. Transfer had no effect on 30-day readmissions (6% vs. 8.5%; AOR, 1.04; p = 0.063). These results were also observed in high-risk surgery patients and in the late surgery group. The results were further confirmed after robust propensity score weighting was performed. We have demonstrated that delays to surgical intervention affect outcomes and that interhospital transfer of EGS patients for definitive surgical care has a negative impact on mortality, development of postoperative complications, and reoperations in patients undergoing high-risk EGS procedures. These findings may have important implications for regionalization of EGS care. Prognostic/epidemiological, level III."

    "abstract": "Background: Scoring systems are often used describe the degree of multi-system organ failure (MOF), however, the data used to calculate these scores are often missing. Studies utilizing these scoring systems often underreport the frequency of missing data. No study has examined the availability of clinical data needed to calculate Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), and other organ failure scores. The primary objective of this study is to observe how often emergency general surgery and trauma patients have missing data needed to calculate MOF scores. Patients and Methods: Patients admitted between June 2017 and September 2019 were evaluated. Data to calculate SOFA, quick SOFA (qSOFA), Marshall Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS), Denver Post-Injury Multiple Organ Failure, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, as well as demographic and general admission and discharge data, were collected. Results: Of the 238 patients included in this study, 66.4% were emergency general surgery and 33.6% were trauma patients. For all patients, the median intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) was seven days (range, 4-12), the median hospital LOS was 14 days (range, 10-21), and 28 patients (11.8%) did not survive to hospital discharge. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment was calculable in 21.4%-18.1%, whereas MODS was calculable in 6.3%-5.0% on days three and five, respectively. The Denver score was calculable in 32.5%-28.8% of trauma patients on these days. Of the data points needed to calculate these scores, the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FIo2) ratio, central venous pressure (CVP), and bilirubin were the least available components. Conclusions: Data needed to fully calculate SOFA and other common MOF scores are often not readily available highlighting the degree of imputation required to calculate these scores. We recommend better reporting of the degree of missing data in the literature."

    "abstract": "Robotics represents the most technologically advanced approach in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Its application in general surgery has increased progressively, with some early experience reported in emergency settings. The present position paper, supported by the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES), aims to provide a systematic review of the literature to develop consensus statements about the potential use of robotics in emergency general surgery. This position paper was conducted according to the WSES methodology. A steering committee was constituted to draft the position paper according to the literature review. An international expert panel then critically revised the manuscript. Each statement was voted through a web survey to reach a consensus. Ten studies (3 case reports, 3 case series, and 4 retrospective comparative cohort studies) have been published regarding the applications of robotics for emergency general surgery procedures. Due to the paucity and overall low quality of evidence, 6 statements are proposed as expert opinions. In general, the experts claim for a strict patient selection while approaching emergent general surgery procedures with robotics, eventually considering it for hemodynamically stable patients only. An emergency setting should not be seen as an absolute contraindication for robotic surgery if an adequate training of the operating surgical team is available. In such conditions, robotic surgery can be considered safe, feasible, and associated with surgical outcomes related to an MIS approach. However, there are some concerns regarding the adoption of robotic surgery for emergency surgeries associated with the following: (i) the availability and accessibility of the robotic platform for emergency units and during night shifts, (ii) expected longer operative times, and (iii) increased costs. Further research is necessary to investigate the role of robotic surgery in emergency settings and to explore the possibility of performing telementoring and telesurgery, which are particularly valuable in emergency situations. Many hospitals are currently equipped with a robotic surgical platform which needs to be implemented efficiently. The role of robotic surgery for emergency procedures remains under investigation. However, its use is expanding with a careful assessment of costs and timeliness of operations. The proposed statements should be seen as a preliminary guide for the surgical community stressing the need for reevaluation and update processes as evidence expands in the relevant literature."

    "abstract": "Background: The implementation of the acute surgical unit (ASU) model has been demonstrated to improve care outcomes for the emergency general surgery patient in comparison to the traditional \"on call\" model. Currently, only few studies have evaluated surgical outcomes of the ASU model in patients with acute biliary pathologies. This is the first comparative study of two different emergency surgery structures in the acute management of patients with acute cholecystitis and biliary colic. Methods: A retrospective review of patients who underwent emergency cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis and biliary colic at two tertiary hospitals between April 2018 and March 2019 was conducted. Primary outcomes included length of hospital stay, time from admission to definitive surgery, and postoperative complications. Secondary outcomes include proportion of cases performed during daylight hours, length of operating time, rate of conversion to open cholecystectomy, and consultant surgeon involvement. Results: A total of 339 patients presented with acute biliary symptoms and were managed operatively. Univariate analysis identified a shorter mean time to surgery in the traditional group compared to the ASU group (29.2 hours versus 43.1 hours; P < .001). There was no difference in mean length of stay, operation duration between models, and postoperative complication rates between groups, with the majority of surgeries performed during daylight hours. The ASU group had a greater proportion of consultant-led cases (48.2% versus 2.5%, P < .001) compared to the traditional group. Conclusion: Patients with acute biliary pathology requiring laparoscopic cholecystectomy achieve equivalent surgical outcomes irrespective of the model of acute surgical care."

Patients with negative imaging for acute cholecystitis may be inappropriately sent home. The purpose of our study was to review the pathology and outcomes of patients presenting with biliary pain and negative ultrasound findings of acute cholecystitis. Emergency department patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy between January 2015 and February 2019 were reviewed retrospectively. Only patients with negative or equivocal imaging were included. The primary outcome was the incidence of cholecystitis on final pathology. Two hundred fifty-seven patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Pathology demonstrated cholecystitis in 84% of patients. Only 15% of patients had cholelithiasis without cholecystitis on pathology. The incidence of cholecystitis was similar in negative and equivocal imaging groups (84% versus 83%; P = 0.960). The median time from admission to the operating room was 12.1 h (interquartile range 7.1-18.3 h), and hospital length of stay was 1.2 d (interquartile range 0.8-1.7 d). This study found that patients with negative or equivocal imaging had cholecystitis on pathology. On review of patient outcomes, those patients who underwent surgical intervention had a low rate of complications and short hospital stay."

    "abstract": "Acute care surgery is an important component of health care in the developed nations. However, in Malaysia, acute care surgery is yet to be recognized as a specific subspecialty service. Due to high demands of limited ICU beds, some patients have to be ventilated in the wards. This study aims to describe the outcomes of acute surgical patients that required mechanical ventilation. This is a retrospective review of all mechanically ventilated surgical patients in the wards, in a tertiary hospital, in 2020. Sixty-two patients out of 116 patients ventilated in surgical wards fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Demography, surgical diagnosis and procedures and physiologic, biochemical and survival data were analyzed to explore the outcomes and predictors of mortality. Twenty-two out of 62 patients eventually gained ICU admission. Mean time from intubation to ICU entry and mean length of ICU stay were 48 h (0 to 312) and 10 days (1 to 33), respectively. Survival for patients admitted to ICU compared to ventilation in the acute surgery wards was 54.5% (12/22) vs 17.5% (7/40). Thirty-four patients underwent surgery, and the majority were bowel-related emergency operations. SAPS2 score validation revealed AUC of 0.701. More than half of patients with mortality risk < 50% eventually were not admitted to ICU. ICU care for critically ill surgical patients provides better survival. There is a need to improve triaging for intensive care, especially for low-mortality-risk patients using risk scores which are locally validated."

    "abstract": "An 11-year-old male presented to the pediatric emergency department with a one-day history of peri-umbilical pain with nausea, anorexia, and scant vomiting. On examination, he had moderate tenderness in the right upper quadrant with moderate guarding and rebound tenderness. Imaging showed concern for early acute appendicitis. The patient was admitted and underwent laparoscopic appendectomy. Despite the appendectomy, the patient continued to have fevers and abdominal pain. Four days after the initial presentation, the patient decompensated and was diagnosed with multisystem inflammatory syndrome. This case is interesting because the patient never met diagnostic criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) prior to his decompensation. If a patient's symptoms continue or worsen despite seemingly appropriate management, the patient must be reassessed for other causes of pathology. Surgeons must have a high index of suspicion for MIS-C in patients with recent COVID-19 diagnoses, and this case demonstrates that MIS-C can present in phases and not all at once."

    "abstract": "Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with worse outcomes after elective surgery, but the effect on emergency general surgery (EGS) remains unclear. We examined the association of socioeconomic disadvantage and outcomes after EGS procedures and investigated whether admission to hospitals with comprehensive clinical and social resources mitigated this effect. Adults undergoing 1 of the 10 most burdensome high- and low-risk EGS procedures were identified in six 2014 State Inpatient Databases. Socioeconomic disadvantage was assessed using Area Deprivation Index (ADI) of patient residence. Multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for patient and hospital factors were used to evaluate the association between ADI quartile (high >75 percentile vs. low <25 percentile), and 30-day readmission, in-hospital mortality, and discharge disposition. Effect modification between ADI and (a) level 1 trauma center and (b) safety-net hospital status was tested. A total of 103,749 patients were analyzed: 72,711 low-risk (70.1%) and 31,038 high-risk procedures (29.9%). Patients from neighborhoods with high socioeconomic disadvantage had a higher proportion with ≥3 comorbidities (41.9% vs. 32.0%), minority race/ethnicity (66.3% vs. 42.4%), and Medicaid (28.8% vs. 14.7%) and were less likely to be treated at level 1 trauma centers (18.3% vs. 27.7%; p < 0.001 for all). Adjusting for competing factors, high socioeconomic disadvantage was associated with increased in-hospital mortality after high-risk procedures (odd ratio, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.66; p = 0.04) and higher odds of non-home discharge (odd ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.30; p = 0.03) for low-risk procedures. Socioeconomic disadvantage was not associated with 30-day readmission for either procedure group. Level 1 trauma status and safety-net hospital did not meaningfully mitigate effect of ADI for any outcome. Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with increased mortality after high-risk procedures and higher odds of non-home discharge after low-risk procedures. This effect was not mitigated by either level 1 trauma or safety-net hospitals. Interventions that specifically address the needs of socially vulnerable communities will be required to significantly improve EGS outcomes for this population.

    "abstract": "Recent literature reports a decrease in healthcare-seeking behaviours by adults during the Covid-19 pandemic. Given that emergency general surgery (GS) conditions are often associated with high morbidity and mortality if left untreated, the objective of this study was to describe and quantify the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on rates of emergency department (ED) utilization and hospital admission due to GS conditions. This cohort study involved the analysis of an institutional database and retrospective chart review. We identified adult patients presenting to the ED in a network of three teaching hospitals in Montreal, Canada during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic (March13-May13, 2020) and a control pre-pandemic period (March13-May13, 2019). Patients with GS conditions were included in the analysis. ED utilization rates, admission rates and 30-day outcomes were compared between the two periods using multivariate regression analysis. During the pandemic period, 258 patients presented to ED with a GS diagnosis compared to 351 patients pre-pandemically (adjusted rate ratio (aRR) 0.75; p < 0.001). Rate of hospital admission during the pandemic was also significantly lower (aRR = 0.77, p < 0.001). Patients had a significantly shorter ED stay during the pandemic (adjusted mean difference 5.0 h; p < 0.001). Rates of operative management during the pandemic were preserved compared to the pre-pandemic period. There were no differences in 30-day complications (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.46; p = 0.07), ED revisits (aOR 1.10; p = 0.66) and (re)admissions (aOR 1.42; p = 0.22) between the two periods. There was a decrease in rates of ED utilization and hospital admissions due to GS conditions during the first wave of the Covid -19 pandemic; however, rates of operative management, complications and healthcare reutilization were unchanged. Although our findings are not generalizable to patients who did not seek healthcare, it was possible to successfully uphold institutional standards of care once patients presented to the ED."

    "abstract": "Patients aged ≥65 years currently account for approximately 55% of all emergent operations. However, these patients account for 75% of post-operative mortality. Older age has long been associated with adverse outcomes from emergency surgery. However, old age is a heterogenous state. Recent studies have indicated that frailty may more accurately reflect true biological age and perioperative risk than chronological age alone in patients undergoing elective surgery. Few studies have evaluated the impact of frailty on post-operative outcomes in this setting. A systematic, electronic search for relevant publications was performed in November 2019 using Pubmed and Embase from 2009 to 2019. The latest search for articles was performed on February 16th, 2020. Articles were excluded if frailty was not measured using a frailty tool, or if patients did not undergo emergency general surgery (EGS). The prevalence of frailty amongst patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery was 30.8%. The all-cause mortality rate was 15.68%. The mortality rate amongst the frail undergoing EGS was 24.7%. Frailty was associated with an increased mortality rate compared with the non-frail (odds ratio (OR) 4.3, 95% CI 2.25-8.19%, p < 0.05, I2 = 80%). There is strong evidence to suggest that frailty in the older population predicts post-operative mortality, complications, prolonged length of stay and the loss of independence. Collaborative working with medicine for the elderly physicians to target modifiable aspects of the frailty syndrome in the perioperative pathway may improve outcomes. Frailty scoring should be integrated into acute surgical assessment practice to aid decision-making and development of novel postoperative strategies."

Demographics, consult indications, and investigations/interventions were captured. Outcomes were compared between patients assessed by ACS versus both ACS and BS/SO at presentation. 234 patients met study criteria, with median age 39 years. Patients were primarily Hispanic (82%) women (96%). Most were not seen by BS/SO at presentation (69%), although BS/SO assessment was more frequent among patients ultimately diagnosed with cancer (8% vs 1%, P = .012).

Urgent breast consults at our safety net hospital typically underwent initial assessment by ACS with outpatient evaluation by BS/SO. Time to follow-up and cancer diagnosis, loss to follow-up, and ED recidivism were similar after index presentation assessment by ACS versus ACS and BS/SO.

Demographics, clinical data, and outcomes were obtained from the National Inpatient Sample, 2005-2014, in elderly (65+ years) and non-elderly adult patients (18-64 years) with hemorrhoids who underwent emergency admission. Multivariable logistic regression model with backward elimination was used to identify predictors of mortality. 25 808 adult and 26 978 elderly patients were included. Female patients consisted of 42.5% and 59.3% in adult and elderly, respectively. 42 (.2%) adults died, of which 50% were female and 125 (.5%) elderly patients died, of which 60% were female. Mean (SD) age of the adult patients was 47.8 (11) years and in elderly patients was 78.7 (8) years. 82.2% and 85.7% had internal hemorrhoids in adult and elderly patients, respectively. 9326 (36.1%) adult and 7282 (27%) elderly patients underwent an operation. In the final multivariable logistic regression model for adult patients with operation, delayed operation and invasive diagnostic procedures increased the odds of mortality, whereas in elderly patients, delayed operation and frailty index were the risk factors of mortality. In both adults and elderly with no operation, increased hospital length of stay (HLOS) significantly increased the odds of mortality, and undergoing an invasive diagnostic procedure significantly decreased the odds of mortality. In all operated patients, increased time to operation and undergoing an invasive diagnostic procedure were the risk factors for mortality. On the other hand, in non-operated emergency hemorrhoids patients, increased age and increased HLOS were the risk factors for mortality while undergoing an invasive diagnostic procedure decreased the odds of mortality."

Performance of emergency surgery require complex and varied skills and abilities to achieve procedures from different fields of surgery: abdominal, urologic, thoracic, vascular, soft tissue, skeletal) within an interval of 24 hours (1). In U.S., since 2008, Acute Care Surgery concept was introduced, and nowadays is an evolving specialty with three essential components- trauma, critical care and emergency surgery (2). In UK there is an increasing subspecialisation within general surgery over the last ten years. More recently, there has been an increase in focus on emergency general surgery (3,4). This may not come as a surprise given the fact that trafic crashes kill 1.2 million people annually around the world (3242 people/day) and 90% are in middle and low income countries. In US trauma is the leading cause of death in persons up to 40 years. Optimal care for emergency surgical patients is one of the major challenges for every healthcare system worldwide. An emergency surgery mai intervene during the daily schedule of elective interventions and create pressure on both the organisation and costs (5). Since it's birth, in 2007, the Romanian Society for Emergency Surgery and Trauma was involved in supporting the development of practice in emergency surgery in Romania by many actions: each year, during biannual National Congres and National Conference of the Romanian Society of Surgery 2 sessions were dedicated to emergency surgery, with invited foreign speakers; oragnisation of European Congres of Emergency and Trauma Surgery in 2017 in Bucharest, 1 tematic issue of Chirurgia Journal dedicated to surgery of the cirrhotic patients. This tematic isssue includes varia subjects from emergency surgery in valuable articles. The management of open abdomen management are depicted by Anastasiu et al, in a review summarizing definition, classification, indications, methods of temporary abdominal closure and fascial closure, and enterocutanous fistula. Turculet et al, perfomed a review of the litterature to describe the main advantages and disadvantages of the trauma systems in Europe and to present the last concepts regarding the management of the polytrauma patients and the newest sets of measures to prevent car crashes in European Union.

This study aimed to estimate the population of Guatemala with timely access to surgical care and identify existing hospitals where the expansion of surgical services would increase access. The World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists (WFSA) Anesthesia Facility Assessment Tool (AFAT) previously identified 37 public Guatemalan hospitals that provide surgical care. Nine additional public non-surgical hospitals were also identified. Geospatial analysis was performed to estimate walking and driving geographic access to all 46 hospitals. We calculated the potential increase in access that would accompany the expansion of surgical services at each of the nine non-surgical hospitals. The percentage of the population with walking access to a surgical hospital within 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h are 5·1%, 12·9%, and 27·3%, respectively. The percentage of people within 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h driving times are 27·3%, 41·1%, and 53·1%, respectively. The median percentage of the population within each of Guatemala's 22 administrative departments with 2 h walking access was 19·0% [IQR 14·1-30·7] and 2 h driving access was 52·4% [IQR 30·5-62·8]. Expansion of surgical care at existing public Guatemalan hospitals in Guatemala would result in a minimal increase in overall geographic access compared to current availability. While Guatemala provides universal health coverage, geographic access to surgical care remains inadequate. Geospatial mapping and survey data work synergistically to assess surgical system strength and identify gaps in geographic access to essential surgical care. None."

    "abstract": "Trauma and acute care surgery (ACS) staffing models vary widely across the United States, resulting in large discrepancies in staffing, compensation, schedule, and clinical/nonclinical expectations. An urgent need exists to define clinical, academic, and schedule expectations for a full-time employment (FTE) of a trauma and ACS surgeon in the United States. A survey was distributed to departmental leaders at Levels I, II, III trauma centers across the United States regarding current workload. Variables concerning the responsibilities of surgeons, compensation models, and clinical expectations were collected. This was followed by virtual semistructured interviews of agreeable respondents. A thematic analysis was used to describe current staffing challenges and \"ideal\" staffing and compensation models of trauma centers. Sixty-eight of 483 division chiefs/medical directors responded (14%), the majority (66%) representing Level I centers. There were differences in clinical responsibilities, elective surgery coverage as well as number of and reimbursement for call. The median description of an FTE was 26 weeks (interquartile range, 13 weeks) with a median of 8 (interquartile range, 8) 12-hour call shifts per month. Level III centers were more likely to perform elective surgery and covered more call shifts, typically from home. In our qualitative interviews, we identified numerous themes, including inconsistent models and staffing of services, surgeon-administration conflict and elective surgery driven by productivity and desire. Defining the workload of a full-time trauma and ACS surgeon is nuanced and requires consideration of local volume, acuity and culture. Between the quantitative and qualitative analysis, a reasonable workload for a 1.0 FTE acute care surgeon at a Level I center is 24 to 28 service weeks per year and four to five in-house calls per month. Nighttime and daytime staffing needs can be divergent and may lead to conflict with administration. Future research should consider the individual surgeon's perspective on the definition of an FTE.

In 2016, our institution established a comprehensive in-house EGS service. Herein, we hypothesize that formation of a dedicated EGS service is associated with a significant reduction in morbidity for patients undergoing the most common EGS procedures. All patients undergoing one of the most common EGS procedures within 2 days of admission were identified from 1/1/2013 to 5/9/2019 via a retrospective chart review. Patients were cohorted as pre- and post-EGS implementation. The primary outcome measure was the overall complication rate. Secondary endpoints included mortality, individual complication rate, time to operation, overnight operation, and length of stay. Finally, both cohorts were benchmarked to national outcomes. 718 patients met inclusion criteria (pre-EGS = 409 and post-EGS = 309). Overall complication rate decreased significantly (19.8% vs 13.9%, P = .0387) and overnight operations increased significantly in the post-EGS group (7.8%-16.5%, P = .0003). Pre-EGS complications were higher than national data in all but 1 procedure group, whereas post-EGS complications rates were lower in all but 2 categories. Implementation of a dedicated EGS service line was associated with a significant decrease in complication rate among the most complication-prone EGS procedures. Number of operations within 24 hours did not increase significantly; however, overnight operations did increase. Our results indicate that establishing a service-specific EGS line is reasonable and beneficial."

    "abstract": "We present the case of an 82-year-old woman admitted to a regional emergency general surgery centre with severe left upper quadrant abdominal pain and tenderness within 21 days of receiving the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine (Vaxzevria, AstraZeneca). Following further investigation through CT imaging, a thrombus was discovered in the patient's splenic artery resulting in a large splenic infarct. Splenic infarcts are rare and it is important to note the association between time of administration of the first dose of vaccine and the occurrence of thromboembolic complications in the noted absence of other risk factors for this condition. We hypothesise a link between Vaxzevria vaccine injection and a rare form of thromboembolic complication: thrombosis of the splenic artery."

Using emergency cholecystectomy as a representative operation, this study aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on emergency general surgery in Australia in relation to in-hours versus after-hours operating. A retrospective analysis was conducted of medical records for patients admitted with cholecystitis or biliary colic between 1 March 2019 and 28 February 2021 at Frankston Hospital, Australia. Patient demographics, admission data, imaging findings, operative and post-operative data were compared between pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods. Variables were compared using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney, Chi Squared or Fishers exact test. During the COVID-19 period, emergency cholecystectomy was performed for a greater proportion of patients presenting with cholecystitis or biliary colic (93.5% versus 77.7%, p < 0.01). Despite this, there was concomitant reduction in after-hours cholecystectomy from 14.4% to 7.5% (p = 0.04). Patients requiring after-hours surgery during the COVID-19 period had more features of sepsis (23% more tachypnoeic, 18% more hypotensive), and were more likely to have certain features of cholecystitis on imaging (45% more likely to have pericholecystic fluid). Following elective surgery cancellations during the COVID-19 period, an increase was seen in the proportion of patients presenting with gallstone disease who were managed with emergency cholecystectomy due to improved theatre access. Concurrently, there was a decrease in the requirement for surgery to be performed after-hours."

    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on all aspects of health care. Few up-to-date studies have actually assessed the impact of COVID-19 on emergency surgeries. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the impact of the pandemic relating to the emergency surgery performed, as well as morbidity and mortality rates during the first year of the pandemic (March 2020-February 2021) and during the control period. In this period, the first propaedeutic surgery department and the third surgery department of the University General Hospital of Thessaloniki \"AHEPA\" in Greece provided continuous emergency general surgery services. Material and Methods: The study is in a retrospective cohort and included patients who were admitted to the Emergency Department and underwent emergency general surgery during the control period (n = 456), March 2019-February 2020 and during the first year of the pandemic (n = 223), March 2020-February 2021. Gender, age, type of surgical operation (morbidity), ICU need, the patient's outcome, and days of hospitalization were compared. Results: A total of 679 emergency surgeries were included. Statistically significant differences emerged between the two time periods in the total number of emergency surgeries performed (p < 0.001). The most common type of surgery in the control period was associated with soft tissue infection while, during the pandemic period, the most common type of surgery was associated with the hepatobiliary system. In addition, the mortality rates nearly doubled during the pandemic period (2.2% vs. 4%). Finally, the mean age of our sample was 50.6 ± 17.5 and the majority of the participants in both time periods were males. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic changed significantly the total number of emergency general surgeries performed. Mortality rates doubled and morbidity rates were affected between the control and pandemic periods. Finally, age, gender, length of hospitalization, intensive care unit hospitalization, and laparoscopy use in patients undergoing emergency surgery during the pandemic were stable."

    "abstract": "Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread worldwide. On 23rd March 2020, the UK introduced measures in an effort to curb the disease spread. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of government and Royal College measures on the general surgical take. Materials and methods A retrospective analysis of patients referred to the acute general surgical take between 2nd March 2020 and 5th April 2020, including acuity at the time of referral, management, and patient outcomes, was undertaken. Data fit into a 'pre-COVID measures' cohort (prior to 23rd March 2020) and a 'post-COVID measures' cohort (on or after 23rd March 2020). Results A total of 465 patient referrals were included. There was a decrease in admissions rate in the post-COVID measures' cohort (p=0.001), but with an increase in patient acuity with white cell count (WCC) (p=0.024) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p=0.036). Laparoscopic surgery decreased (p=0.004); however, the proportion of patients having an operation remained constant. There was no increase in short-term morbidity and mortality or length of stay (LOS). Discussion The data suggests that UK lockdown introduction influenced people's behaviour. Fewer patients presented to the surgical take; however, these patients were of higher acuity. Despite changes in royal college guidelines, there was no decrease in the proportion of patients undergoing operations; however, a higher proportion were open procedures. The change in national and college guidelines did not affect short-term morbidity, mortality or LOS."

We aimed to characterize the structures and processes that are relevant to the delivery of EGS care across Ontario hospitals and to evaluate the availability of critical resources at hospitals with formal EGS models. Between August 2019 and July 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario hospitals that offered urgent general surgery (defined as the ability to provide nonelective surgical intervention within 24 to 48 hours of presentation) to adults. People with intimate knowledge of their hospital's EGS program completed a Web-based or telephone survey characterizing the program's organizational structure and staffing, operating room availability, interventional radiology and interventional endoscopy availability, intensive care unit availability and staffing, and regional participation. Their responses were compiled and comparisons were made between hospitals with and without formal EGS models of care, as well as between hospitals based on size and academic status. Of the 114 Ontario hospitals identified, 109 responded (95.6% response rate). A third (34.6%; n = 37/107) of hospitals had EGS models of care. Thirty-four of these (91.9%) were large (> 100-bed) institutions that would be likely to have increased resources. However, even for hospitals of similar size, those with EGS models had increased staffing levels compared to those without (clinical associates 17.6% [n = 3/17] v. 10.0% [n = 2/20]; nurse practitioners or physician assistants 27.8% [n = 5/18] v. 14.3% [n = 3/21]). They also had better access to diagnostic and interventional equipment (24/7 access to computed tomography 94.1% [n = 16/17] v. 69.2% [n = 18/26]), interventional radiology (88.9% [n = 16/18] v. 42.3% [n = 11/26]), endoscopy (100% [n = 18/18] v. 69.2% [n = 18/26]) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (77.8% [n = 14/18] v. 42.3% [n = 11/26]), as well as dedicated operating room time (72.2% [n = 13/18] v. 0% [n = 0/25]). The structures and processes available to care for patients requiring EGS in Ontario were highly variable between hospitals. Hospitals with formal EGS models were more likely to have access to key resources."

    "abstract": "At many trauma centers in the United States, one acute care surgeon is responsible for overnight coverage of both the emergency general surgery (EGS) and trauma services. The impact of this scheduling phenomenon on the quality and safety of trauma care has not been studied. Overnight (12:00 AM to 7:00 AM) trauma admissions to an academic Level 1 trauma center from 2013-2015 were studied after the institution adopted this scheduling phenomenon. Admissions were divided into two groups based on whether the admitting surgeon covered only the trauma service, or both the trauma and EGS services (\"multi-service coverage\"). Four major outcomes (e.g., mortality and complications), six quality metrics (e.g., time to first OR visit and unplanned transfers to the ICU), and procedural utilization patterns were compared. A total of 1046 admissions were included. There were no differences in any major outcomes between the two exposure groups, including any National Trauma Data Bank-defined complication (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.8-1.5, P= 0.5). Quality metrics dependent on the admitting surgeon remained unchanged, including attending presence at the highest-level trauma activations within 15 min of arrival (93% versus 86%, P= 0.07) and time to urgent operative intervention (68 min versus 82 min, P= 0.9). There were no differences in the number of laboratory and imaging studies (4.1 versus 4.1, P= 0.9) or bedside interventions (1.8 versus 2.1, P= 0.4) performed per patient by the admitting surgeon. Multivariate logistic regression did not identify multi-service coverage as an independent risk factor for adverse patient outcomes or quality metrics. Trauma admissions under a surgeon covering multiple services simultaneously had similar outcomes, quality metrics, and procedural utilization patterns compared to trauma admissions under surgeons covering only the trauma service. Despite concerns that multiple-service coverage may overburden one acute care surgeon, time-dependent quality metrics and studies done during the initial workup of trauma patients remained unchanged. These findings suggest that simultaneous trauma and EGS service coverage by one acute care surgeon does not adversely impact trauma patient care."

    "abstract": "Internal herniae are a rare cause of acute small bowel obstruction (SBO), accounting for <1% of all causes of SBO. Given their low incidence and often vague presenting symptoms there can be a delay in their diagnosis - which can lead to unnecessary morbidity for patients. We present a case of a 34 year-old nulliparous female who presented with acute abdominal pain and transpired to have a closed loop obstruction of her ileum through a congenital defect in her broad ligament, or a Quain hernia. This paper will describe this case and provide an updated literature review of Quain herniae from recent research. With regards to surgical management of these hernia, both laparoscopic and open approaches are appropriate as long as appropriately trained surgical staff are involved. If a contraltateral defect in the Broad ligament is identified, this should be repaired prophylactically at the time in order to prevent future instances of internal herniation. Increased awareness of the potential presenting symptoms and radiological features of Quain hernia, as outlined in this paper, is vital in order to reduce patient morbidity and mortality."

The aim of this observational, prospective, multicenter, nationwide study was to determine the best benchmark cutoff points in EGS, as a reference to guide improvement measures. Over a 6-month period, 38 centers (5% of all public hospitals) attending EGS patients on a 24-h, 7-days a week basis, enrolled consecutive patients requiring an emergent/urgent surgical procedure. Patients were stratified into cohorts of low (i.e., expected morbidity risk <33%), middle and high risk using the novel m-LUCENTUM calculator. A total of 7258 patients were included; age (mean ± SD) was 51.1 ± 21.5 years, 43.2% were female. Benchmark cutoffs in the low-risk cohort (5639 patients, 77.7% of total) were: use of laparoscopy ≥40.9%, length of hospital stays ≤3 days, any complication within 30 days ≤ 17.7%, and 30-day mortality ≤1.1%. The variables with the greatest impact were septicemia on length of hospital stay (21 days; adjusted beta coefficient 16.8; 95% CI: 15.3 to 18.3; P < .001), and respiratory failure on mortality (risk-adjusted population attributable fraction 44.6%, 95% CI 29.6 to 59.6, P < .001).

    "abstract": "Direct peritoneal resuscitation (DPR) has been used to help preserve microcirculation by reversing vasoconstriction and hypoperfusion associated with the pathophysiological process of shock, which can occur despite appropriate intravenous resuscitation. This approach depends on infusing a hyperosmolar solution intraperitoneally via a percutaneous catheter with the tip ending near the pelvis or the root of the mesentery. The abdomen is usually left open with a negative pressure abdominal dressing to continuously evacuate the infused dialysate. Hypertonicity of the solution triggers visceral vasodilation to help maintain blood flow, even during shock, and is also associated with reduced local inflammatory cytokines and other mediators, preservation of endothelial cell function, and mitigation of organ edema and necrosis. It also has a direct effect on liver perfusion and edema, more rapidly corrects electrolyte abnormalities compared to intravenous resuscitation alone, and may requireless intravenous fluid to stabilize blood pressure, all of which shortens the time required to close patients' abdomen. An online query using the search term \"direct peritoneal resuscitation\" was carried out in PubMed, MEDLINE and SciELO, limited to publications indexed from January 2014 to June 2020. Of the 20 articles returned, full text was able to be obtained for 19. A manual review of included articles' references was resulted in the addition of 1 article, for a total of 20 included articles. The 20 articles were comprised of 15 animal studies, 4 clinical studies,and 1 expert opinion. The benefits include both local and possibly systemic effects on perfusion, hypoxia, acidosis, and inflammation, and are associated with improved outcomes and reduced complications. DPR shows promise in patients with hemorrhagic shock, septic shock, and other conditions resulting in an open abdomen after damage control laparotomy."

    "abstract": "Previous investigations have shown a positive association between hospital volume of operations and clinical outcomes. However, it is unclear whether such relationships also apply to emergency surgery. We sought to examine the association between hospital case volume and inpatient mortality for 7 common emergency general surgery (EGS) operations among geriatric patients. This is a population based retrospective cohort study using the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Limited Dataset Files (LDS) from 2011 to 2013. The 7 most common emergency surgeries included (1) partial colectomy, (2) small-bowel resection (SBR), (3) cholecystectomy, (4) appendectomy, (5) lysis of adhesions (LOA), (6) operative management of peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and (7) laparotomy with the primary outcome being inpatient mortality. Risk-adjusted inpatient mortality was plotted against operative volume. Subsequently an operative volume threshold was calculated using a best fit regression method. Based on these estimates, high- and low-volume hospitals were compared to examine significance of outcomes. Significance was defined as P-value < .05. The final cohort comprised of 414 779 patients from 3994 hospitals. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for high-volume centers were lower in 6 out of 8 surgeries examined. Small-bowel resection and partial colectomy operations had a significant decrease in mortality based on a volume threshold. We observed decreased mortality with higher surgical volume for small-bowel resection and partial colectomy operations. Such differences may be related to practice patterns during the perioperative period, as complications related to the perioperative care were significantly lower for high-volume centers."

This study analyzes the outcomes of patients who have undergone emergency general surgery (EGS) procedures after cardiothoracic surgery (CTS) at the same hospitalization. This was a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent emergent abdominal surgery after CTS surgery between 2010-2018. The CTS procedures included coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), valve replacement, cardiac transplant, aortic replacement, ventricular assist device, and pericardial procedures. The records were reviewed to obtain demographics, frequency distribution of EGS procedures, complications, outcomes, and the risk factors of mortality. Of 4826 patients who had CTS, 57 (1.2%) underwent EGS procedures during the period of 2010-2018. This cohort of patients had 113 CTS and 85 EGS procedures during the same hospitalization. The mean age was 62 years, and 49% were elderly (40% were females). CABG with or without valve replacement was the most common surgery (28%). After surgical consultation for \"acute abdomen\" in the post-CTS phase, the three most common findings on exploratory laparotomy were bowel perforation (23%), massive free fluid leading to abdominal compartment syndrome (19%), and acute cholecystitis (16%). Respiratory failure (46%), acute kidney injury (32%), and multiple organ dysfunction (18%) were the most common hospital-acquired complications. Regarding dispositions, 47% were discharged to an acute rehabilitation center, 10% were discharged to a sub-acute rehabilitation center, and a similar proportion of patients went home (10%). On multivariable logistic regression analysis with backward elimination, age (OR=1.10, 95% CI: 1.02-1.18) and serum proteins (OR=0.99, 95% CI: 0.98-0.998) were independently associated with the odds of mortality after EGS in the immediate CTS phase. Respiratory failure is the most common complication of EGS immediately after CTS. The older the patient and the lower the serum proteins, the higher the odds of mortality in patients who undergo EGS after ETS."

The aims of this study were to identify the frequency of EGSP and charges incurred by OA compared to their younger counterparts in the state of Maryland. A retrospective review of the Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission from 2009 to 2018 was undertaken. Patients undergoing urgent or emergent ESGP were divided into 2 groups (18-64 years and ≥65 years). Data collected included demographics, APR-severity of illness (SOI), APR-risk of mortality (ROM), the EGSP (partial colectomy [PC], small bowel resection [SBR], cholecystectomy, operative management of peptic ulcer disease, lysis of adhesions, appendectomy, and laparotomy), length of stay (LOS), and hospital charges. P-values (P < .05) were significant. Of the 181,283 patients included in the study, 55,401 (38.1%) were ≥65 years of age. Older adults presented with greater APR-SOI (major 37.7% vs 21.3%, extreme 5.2% vs 9.3%), greater APR-ROM (major 25.3% vs 8.7%, extreme 22.3% vs 5.3%), underwent PC (24.5% vs 10.9%) and SBR (12.8% vs 7.0%) more frequently, and incurred significantly higher median hospital charges for every EGSP, consistently between 2009 and 2018 due to increased LOS and complications when compared to those ≤65 years of age. These findings stress the need for validated frailty indices and quality improvement initiatives focused on the care of OAs in emergency general surgery to maximize outcomes and optimize cost."

    "abstract": "Routine frailty assessment has emerged recently in the surgical literature and is an important prognostication and risk stratification tool. The aim of our study was to review our 7-y experience with two frailty assessment tools and changing trends in their use. We performed a 7-y (2011-2017) analysis of our prospectively maintained frailty database. Frail patients were identified using the emergency general surgery and trauma specific frailty indices. Outcome measures were rates of compliance with frailty assessment, overall complications, discharge to skilled nursing facility (SNF)/rehab, and mortality over the study period. Multivariate logistic regression and Cochran-Armitage trend analyses were performed. We evaluated a total of 1045 geriatric patients (Trauma: 587, EGS: 458). Mean age was 74.5 ± 7.9 y, 74% were males, and 81% were white. Overall, 34% of the patients were frail. Compared to non-frail patients, frail patients had higher adjusted rates of complications (OR 2.4 [1.9-2.9]), mortality (OR 1.8 [1.4-2.3]), and rehab/SNF disposition (OR 3.7 [3.1-4.3]). The compliance rate of measuring frailty increased from 12% in 2011 to 78% in 2017, P < 0.001 (Figure). The complication rate decreased (33% versus 21%, P < 0.001), while the rate of discharge disposition to SNF/Rehab increased (41% versus 58%, P < 0.001). There was no difference in mortality (11% versus 9.8%, P = 0.48) over the study period. Adherence to frailty measurement increased over the study period. This was accompanied by a significant decline in overall in-hospital complications. Frailty indices can be utilized to identify high-risk patients and develop post-operative strategies to improve outcomes in acute care surgery."

These patients have a high prevalence of comorbidities. This study aims to identify patient factors, physiological and time-related factors, which place patients into a group at increased risk of mortality. In a retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing an emergency laparotomy at Greys Hospital from December 2012 to 2018, we used decision tree discrimination to identify high-risk groups. Our cohort included 1461 patients undergoing a laparotomy for an EGS condition. The mortality rate was 12.4% (181). Nine hundred and ten patients (62.3%) had at least one known comorbidity on admission. There was a higher rate of comorbidities among those that died (154; 85.1%). Patient factors found to be associated with mortality were the age of 46 years or greater (p < 0.001), current tuberculosis (p < 0.001), hypertension (p = 0.014), at least one comorbidity (0.006), and malignancy (0.033). Significant physiological risk factors for mortality were base excess less than -6.8 mmol/L (p < 0.001), serum urea greater than 7.0 mmol/L (p < 0.001) and waiting time from admission to operation (p = 0.014). In patients with an enteric breach, those younger than 46 years and a Shock Index of more than 1.0 were high-risk. Patients without an enteric breach were high-risk if operative duration exceeded 90 min (p = 0.004) and serum urea exceeding 7 mmol/dl (p = 0.016). In EGS patients, patient factors as well as physiological factors place patients into a high-risk group. Identifying a high-risk group should prompt consideration for an adjusted approach that ameliorates outcomes."

We examined the Aortic Occlusion in Resuscitation for Trauma and Acute Care Surgery registry over a 5-year period (2014-2018). Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta outcomes were analyzed by stratifying institutions into low-volume (<10), average-volume (11-30), and high-volume (>30) deployment centers. A multivariable model adjusting for volume group, mechanism of injury, signs of life, systolic blood pressure at initiation, operator level, device type, zone of placement, and hemodynamic response to aortic occlusion was created to analyze REBOA mortality and REBOA-related complications. Four hundred ninety-five REBOA placements were included. High-volume centers accounted for 63%, while low accounted for 13%. High-volume institutions were more likely to place a REBOA in the emergency department (81% vs. 63% low volume, p = 0.003), had a lower mean systolic blood pressure at insertion (53 ± 38 vs. 64 ± 40, p = 0.001), and more Zone I deployments (64% vs. 55%, p = 0.002). Median time from admission to REBOA placement was significantly less in patients treated at high-volume centers (15 [7-30] minutes vs. 35 [20-65] minutes, p = 0.001). Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta mortality was significantly higher at low-volume centers (67% vs. 57%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.29; adj p = 0.040), while average- and high-volume centers were similar. Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta complications were less frequent at high-/average-volume centers, but did not reach statistical significance (adj p = 0.784). Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta survival is increased at high versus low utilization centers. Increased experience with REBOA may be associated with earlier deployment and subsequently improved patient outcomes. Therapeutic/Care Management, level IV."

Our department implemented an acute care urology (ACU) service in 2015, and the service evolved in 2018. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the ACU model on the management of nephrolithiasis. Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of all patients with urology consults in the emergency department for nephrolithiasis, who required surgical intervention from 2013 to 2019. Patients were divided into three cohorts based on date of consultation: Pre-ACU (2013-2014), Phase 1 (2015-2017), and Phase 2 (2018-2019). Results: We identified 733 patients with nephrolithiasis requiring intervention (162 pre-ACU, 334 Phase 1, and 237 Phase 2). Before ACU implementation, median time from consult to definitive intervention was 36 days. After ACU implementation, median time to intervention decreased to 22 days in Phase 1 (p < 0.001) and 15 days in Phase 2 (p < 0.001). On multivariable Cox regression, the hazard of definitive intervention improved in Phase 1 (hazard ratio [HR] 1.90, p < 0.001) and in Phase 2 (HR 1.80, p < 0.001). Rates of primary definitive intervention without initial decompression and loss to follow-up were also significantly improved, compared to the pre-ACU cohort. Conclusions: Implementation of a structured ACU service was associated with improved time to treatment for patients with acute nephrolithiasis, as well as increased primary definitive intervention and improved follow-up care. This model of care has potential to improve patient outcomes for nephrolithiasis and other acute urological conditions."

    "abstract": "Higher workload is associated with burnout and lower performance. Therefore, we aim to assess shift-related factors associated with higher workload on EGS, ICU, and trauma surgery services. In this prospective cohort study, faculty surgeons and surgery residents completed a survey after each EGS, ICU, or trauma shift, including shift details and a modified NASA-TLX. Seventeen faculty and 12 residents completed 174 and 48 surveys after working scheduled 12-h and 24-h shifts, respectively (response rates: faculty - 62%, residents - 42%). NASA-TLX was significantly increased with a higher physician subjective fatigue level. Further, seeing more consults or performing more operations than average significantly increased workload. Finally, NASA-TLX was significantly higher for faculty when they felt their shift was more difficult than expected. Higher volume clinical responsibilities and higher subjective fatigue levels are independently associated with higher workload. Designing shift coverage to expand on busier days may decrease workload, impacting burnout and shift performance."

    "abstract": "Multiple acute care surgery (ACS) working models have been implemented. To optimize resources and on-call rosters, knowledge about work characteristics is required. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the daily work characteristics of ACS surgeons at a Swiss tertiary care hospital. Single-center prospective snapshot study. In February 2020, ACS fellows prospectively recorded their work characteristics, case volume and surgical case mix for 20 day shifts and 16 night shifts. Work characteristics were categorized in 11 different activities and documented in intervals of 30 min. Descriptive statistics were applied. A total of 432.5 working hours (h) were documented and characterized. The three main activities 'surgery,' 'patient consultations' and 'administrative work' ranged from 30.8 to 35.9% of the documented working time. A total of 46 surgical interventions were performed. In total, during day shifts, there were 16 elective and 15 emergency interventions, during night shifts 15 emergency interventions. For surgery, two peaks between 10:00 a.m.-02:00 p.m. and 08:00 p.m.-11:00 p.m. were observed. A total of 225 patient were consulted, with a first peak between 08:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. and a second, wider peak between 02:00 p.m. and 02:00 a.m. The three main activities 'surgery,' 'patient consultations' and 'administrative work' were comparable with approximately one third of the working time each. There was a bimodal temporal distribution for both surgery and patient consultations. These results may help to improve hospital resources and on-call rosters of ACS services."

    "abstract": "Regionalization of emergency general surgery (EGS) has primarily focused on expediting care of high acuity patients through interfacility transfers. In contrast, triaging low-risk patients to a nondesignated trauma facility has not been evaluated. This study evaluates a 16-month experience of a five-surgeon team triaging EGS patients at a tertiary care, Level I trauma center (TC) to an affiliated community hospital 1.3 miles away. All EGS patients who presented to the Level I TC emergency department from January 2020 to April 2021 were analyzed. Patients were screened by EGS surgeons covering both facilities for transfer appropriateness including hemodynamics, resource need, and comorbidities. Patients were retrospectively evaluated for disposition, diagnosis, comorbidities, length of stay, surgical intervention, and 30-day mortality and readmission. Of 987 patients reviewed, 31.5% were transferred to the affiliated community hospital, 16.1% were discharged home from the emergency department, and 52.4% were admitted to the Level I TC. Common diagnoses were biliary disease (16.8%), bowel obstruction (15.7%), and appendicitis (14.3%). Compared with Level I TC admissions, Charlson Comorbidity Index was lower (1.89 vs. 4.45, p < 0.001) and length of stay was shorter (2.23 days vs. 5.49 days, p < 0.001) for transfers. Transfers had a higher rate of surgery (67.5% vs. 50.1%, p < 0.001) and lower readmission and mortality (8.4% vs. 15.3%, p = 0.004; 0.6% vs. 5.0%, p < 0.001). Reasons not to transfer were emergency evaluation, comorbidity burden, operating room availability, and established care. No transfers required transfer back to higher care (under-triage). Bed days saved at the Level I TC were 693 (591 inpatients). Total operating room minutes saved were 24,008 (16,919, between 7:00 am and 5:00 pm). Transfer of appropriate patients maintains high quality care and outcomes, while improving operating room and bed capacity and resource utilization at a tertiary care, Level I TC. Emergency general surgery regionalization should consider triage of both high-risk and low-risk patients. Prospective comparative cohort study, Level II."

Attempts have been made to improve these outcomes by adopting damage control principles known to benefit polytraumatized patients. Studies describing the use of staged laparotomy (SL) in EGS have been modest in size and heterogenous. The aim of this study was to describe our experience with SL at a tertiary hospital in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The Hybrid Electronic Medical Registry (HEMR) at Greys Hospital was interrogated for all consecutive admissions undergoing staged EGS laparotomy. Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed. From 2012 to 2018, 242 patients (16.5% of all EGS laparotomies) underwent SL for an EGS condition. The median patient age was 38 years old (IQR 27-56 years). Physiological indications were present in 125 patients (51.7%) and non-physiological indications (NPI) in 117 (48.3%). Haemodynamic instability was the most common physiological indication (51; 21.1%) and gross contamination was the most non-physiological indication (91; 37.6%). Adverse event and mortality rates were 84.8% and 26.9%, respectively. Independent predictors of mortality were enteric breach (OR3.9; 95% CI (2.1-7.8)), physiological indication (OR 2.1; 95% CI (1.1-3.7)) and anastomosis (OR 2.0; 1.05-3.73). \"Clip and drop\" did not contribute to mortality (P = 0.43; OR1.34 (0.64-2.7)). Mortality was higher in the group without repeat laparotomy. Mortality rate was not associated with increasing number of relaparotomies. Patients undergoing EGS laparotomy form a high-risk group. \"Clip and drop\" approach and number of relaparotomies were not associated with mortality. Indications and components of this approach need to be standardized."

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has impacted both emergency and elective surgical management owing to its highly infectious nature and the shortage of personal protective equipment. This study aimed to review the outcomes of emergency surgical conditions and trauma during the pandemic lockdown. We retrospectively reviewed and collected data from patients who attended the Acute Care Surgery Service from 1st April to May 31st, 2020 during Thailand's COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. We separated staff and performed preoperative COVID-19 swab testing on all patients to assess the requirement for personal protective equipment. Compared with previous years of service, of 2018 and 2019. Preoperative COVID-19 testing was performed using multiplex and manual RT-PCR. Morbidity and mortality, consultation time, and waiting time to surgery were analyzed. A total of 61 patients were enrolled. The average age of patients was 53.8 years. The average consultation time, waiting time to surgery, and surgical duration were 10 min, 660 min, and 88.77 min, respectively. The average time taken to obtain the preoperative COVID-19 test result was 227.26 min. The morbidity and mortality rates were 9.84% and 1.64%, respectively. Compared with the same period in 2018 and 2019, consultation time was significantly faster (10 min; p = 0.033) and waiting time to surgery was significantly longer (660 min, respectively; p = 0.011). Morbidity and mortality between pandemic period and the previous year of service were not significantly different. No medical workers were infected with COVID-19. During the COVID-19 pandemic, optimal triage of emergency patients is key. Waiting for preoperative COVID-19 swab testing in emergency case is safe and results in good outcomes. Although the waiting time to surgery was significantly longer owing to the time required to receive preoperative COVID-19 swab results, morbidity and mortality rates were unaffected."

    "abstract": "In response to the staggering global burden of conditions requiring emergency and essential surgery, the development of international surgical system strengthening (SSS) is fundamental to achieving universal, timely, quality, and affordable surgical care. Opportunity exists in identifying optimal collaborative processes that both promote global surgery research and SSS, and include medical students. This study explores an education model to engage students in academic global surgery and SSS via institutional support for longitudinal research. We set out to design a program to align global health education and longitudinal health systems research by creating an education model to engage medical students in academic global surgery and SSS. In 2015, medical schools in the United States and Colombia initiated a collaborative partnership for academic global surgery research and SSS. This included development of two longitudinal academic tracks in global health medical education and academic global surgery, which we differentiated by level of institutional resourcing. Herein is a retrospective evaluation of the first two years of this program by using commonly recognized academic output metrics. In the first two years of the program, there were 76 total applicants to the two longitudinal tracks. Six of the 16 (37.5%) accepted students selected global surgery faculty as mentors (Acute Care Surgery faculty participating in SSS with Colombia). These global surgery students subsequently spent 24 total working weeks abroad over the two-year period participating in culminating research experiences in SSS. As a quantitative measure of the program's success, the students collectively produced a total of twenty scholarly pieces in the form of accepted posters, abstracts, podium presentations, and manuscripts in partnership with Colombian research mentors. The establishment of scholarly global health education and research tracks has afforded our medical students an active role in international SSS through participation in academic global surgery research. We propose that these complementary programs can serve as a model for disseminated education and training of the future global systems-aware surgeon workforce with bidirectional growth in south and north regions with traditionally under-resourced SSS training programs."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to discuss the goals of palliative care with regards to acute care surgery patients and review the literature regarding administration and implementation of palliative programs. For patients who experience unexpected and sometimes catastrophic life changes related to trauma or emergency general surgery, palliative care is a crucial adjunct that can help ensure the provision of optimal symptom management, communication, and goal-concordant care provided. Palliative care is medical specialty with a philosophy of care focused on improving the quality of life for patients with serious injury or illness and their loved ones. Palliative care provides significant benefit across the entire spectrum of illness and injury, regardless of prognosis. We will discuss palliative care topics related to trauma and emergency general surgery patients, including symptom management, goal setting, end of life care, communication strategies, addressing implicit/explicit bias, trauma-specific and emergency general surgery-specific considerations, and implementation strategies to reduce barriers for utilization of palliative care. Unfortunately, palliative care is often underutilized in the trauma and emergency general surgery population. Acute care surgeons should be familiar with principles of primary palliative care, as well as understand the added benefits that be provided by consultant palliative care specialists."

    "abstract": "The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly disrupted both elective and acute medical care. Data from the early months suggest that acute care patient populations deferred presenting to the emergency department (ED), portending more severe disease at the time of presentation. Additionally, care for this patient population trended towards initial non-operative management. To examine the presentation, management, and outcomes of patients who developed gallbladder disease or appendicitis during the pandemic. A retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, symptomatic cholelithiasis, or appendicitis in two EDs affiliated with a single tertiary academic medical center in Northern California between March and June, 2020 and in the same months of 2019. Patients were selected through a research repository using international classification of diseases (ICD)-9 and ICD-10 codes. Across both years, 313 patients were identified with either type of gallbladder disease, while 361 patients were identified with acute appendicitis. The primary outcome was overall incidence of disease. Secondary outcomes included presentation, management, complications, and 30-d re-presentation rates. Relationships between different variables were explored using Pearson's r correlation coefficient. Variables were compared using the Welch's t-Test, Chi-squared tests, and Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Patients with gallbladder disease and appendicitis both had more severe presentations in 2020. With respect to gallbladder disease, more patients in the COVID-19 cohort presented with acute cholecystitis compared to the control cohort [50% (80) vs 35% (53); P = 0.01]. Patients also presented with more severe cholecystitis in 2020 as indicated by higher mean Tokyo Criteria Scores [mean (SD) 1.39 (0.56) vs 1.16 (0.44); P = 0.02]. With respect to appendicitis, more patients were diagnosed with a perforated appendix at presentation in 2020 [20% (36) vs 16% (29); P = 0.02] and a greater percentage were classified as emergent cases using the emergency severity index [63% (112) vs 13% (23); P < 0.001]. While a greater percentage of patients were admitted to the hospital for gallbladder disease in 2020 [65% (104) vs 50% (76); P = 0.02], no significant differences were observed in hospital admissions for patients with appendicitis. No significant differences were observed in length of hospital stay or operative rate for either group. However, for patients with appendicitis, 30-d re-presentation rates were significantly higher in 2020 [13% (23) vs 4% (8); P = 0.01]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients presented with more severe gallbladder disease and appendicitis. These findings suggest that the pandemic has affected patients with acute surgical conditions."

The purpose of this study is to review the recent literature and offer recommendations for VTE chemoprophylaxis in trauma and EGS patients. We conducted a literature search from 2000 to 2021 for articles investigating VTE chemoprophylaxis in adult trauma and EGS patients. This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Our search resulted in 34 articles. Most studies showed low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is similar to unfractionated heparin (UFH) for VTE prevention; however, LMWH was more commonly used. Adjusted chemoprophylaxis dosing did not change the VTE rate but the timing did. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been shown to be safe and effective in trauma and traumatic brain injury (TBI)/spinal cord injury (SCI). Studies showed VTE prophylaxis in EGS can be inconsistent and improves with guidelines that lower VTE events. There may be no benefit to receiving LMWH over UFH in trauma patients. In addition, different drugs under the class of LMWH do not change the incidence of VTE. Adjusted dosing of enoxaparin does not seem to affect VTE incidence. The use of DOACs in the trauma TBI and SCI setting has been shown to be safe and effective in reducing VTE. One important consideration with VTE prophylaxis may be the timing of prophylaxis initiation, specifically as it relates to TBI, with a higher likelihood of developing VTE as time progresses. EGS patients are at a high risk of VTE. Improved compliance with clinical guidelines in this population is correlated with decreased thrombotic events."

Our objective was to measure gaps in round-the-clock EGS care. From August 2015 to December 2015, we surveyed all US-based, adult acute care general hospitals that have an emergency room and ≥1 operating room and provide EGS care, utilizing paper and electronic methods. Surgeons or chief medical officers were queried regarding EGS practices. Of 2,811 hospitals, 1,634 (58.1%) responded; 279 (17.1%) were unable to always provide round-the-clock EGS care. Rural location, smaller bed size, and non-teaching status were associated with lack of round-the-clock care. Inconsistent surgeon coverage was the primary reason for lacking round-the-clock EGS care (n=162; 58.1%). However, lack of a tiered system for booking emergency cases, no anesthesia availability overnight, and no stipend for EGS call were also associated with the inability to provide round-the-clock EGS care. We found significant gaps in access to EGS care, often attributable to workforce deficiencies."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of laparoscopic surgery for common emergency general surgery (EGS) procedures within an integrated Acute Care Surgery (ACS) network. We hypothesized that laparoscopy would be associated with improved outcomes. Our integrated health care system's EGS registry created from AAST EGS ICD-9 codes was queried from January 2013 to October 2015. Procedures were grouped as laparoscopic or open. Standard descriptive and univariate tests were performed, and a multivariable logistic regression controlling for open status, age, BMI, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), trauma tier, and resuscitation diagnosis was performed. Laparoscopic procedures converted to open were identified and analyzed using concurrent procedure billing codes across episodes of care. Of 60,604 EGS patients identified over the 33-month period, 7280 (12.0%) had an operation and 6914 (11.4%) included AAST-defined EGS procedures. There were 4813 (69.6%) surgeries performed laparoscopically. Patients undergoing a laparoscopic procedure tended to be younger (45.7 ± 18.0 years vs. 57.2 ± 17.6, p < 0.001) with similar BMI (29.7 ± 9.0 kg/m2 vs. 28.8 ± 8.3, p < 0.001). Patients in the laparoscopic group had lower mean CCI score (1.6 ± 2.3 vs. 3.4 ± 3.2, p ≤ 0.0001). On multivariable analysis, open surgery had the highest association with inpatient mortality (OR 8.67, 4.23-17.75, p < 0.0001) and at all time points (30-, 90-day, 1-, 3-year). At all time points, conversion to open was found to be a statistically significant protective factor. Use of laparoscopy in EGS is common and associated with a decreased risk of all-cause mortality at all time points compared to open procedures. Conversion to open was protective at all time points compared to open procedures."

    "abstract": "Although patients with emergency general surgery (EGS) conditions frequently undergo interhospital transfers, the transfer patterns and associated factors are not well understood. To examine whether patients with EGS conditions are consistently directed to hospitals with more resources and better outcomes. This cohort study performed a network analysis of interhospital transfers among adults with EGS conditions from January 1 to December 31, 2016. The analysis used all-payer claims data from the 2016 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project state inpatient and emergency department databases in 8 states. A total of 728 hospitals involving 85 415 transfers of 80 307 patients were included. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were 18 years or older and had an acute care hospital encounter with a diagnosis of an EGS condition as defined by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma. Data were analyzed from January 1, 2020, to June 17, 2021. Hospital-level measures of size (total bed capacity), resources (intensive care unit [ICU] bed capacity, teaching status, trauma center designation, and presence of trauma and/or surgical critical care fellowships), EGS volume (annual EGS encounters), and EGS outcomes (risk-adjusted failure to rescue and in-hospital mortality). The main outcome was hospital-level centrality ratio, defined as the normalized number of incoming transfers divided by the number of outgoing transfers. A higher centrality ratio indicated more incoming transfers per outgoing transfer. Multivariable regression analysis was used to test the hypothesis that a higher hospital centrality ratio would be associated with more resources, higher volume, and better outcomes. Among 80 307 total patients, the median age was 63 years (interquartile range [IQR], 50-75 years); 52.1% of patients were male and 78.8% were White. The median number of outgoing and incoming transfers per hospital were 106 (IQR, 61-157) and 36 (IQR, 8-137), respectively. A higher log-transformed centrality ratio was associated with more resources, such as higher ICU capacity (eg, >25 beds vs 0-10 beds: β = 1.67 [95% CI, 1.16-2.17]; P < .001), and higher EGS volume (eg, quartile 4 [highest] vs quartile 1 [lowest]: β = 0.78 [95% CI, 0-1.57]; P = .01). However, a higher log-transformed centrality ratio was not associated with better outcomes, such as lower in-hospital mortality (eg, quartile 4 [highest] vs quartile 1 [lowest]: β = 0.30 [95% CI, -0.09 to 0.68]; P = .83) and lower failure to rescue (eg, quartile 4 [highest] vs quartile 1 [lowest]: β = -0.50 [95% CI, -1.13 to 0.12]; P = .27). In this study, EGS transfers were directed to high-volume hospitals with more resources but were not necessarily directed to hospitals with better clinical outcomes. Optimizing transfer destination in the interhospital transfer network has the potential to improve EGS outcomes."

    "abstract": "Postoperative nausea and vomiting and postoperative ileus are common after major digestive surgery and represent one of the significant problems in Acute Care Surgery. The delivery model of emergency surgery needs to be improved in order to foster a patient-centered care. The multimodal approach suggested by Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS®) Guidelines is gaining widespread acceptance but is difficult to apply to emergency surgery. Ultrasound examination of the gastric antrum allows a reliable assessment of gastric contents and volume and might help contribute to improve perioperative care in the emergency setting. Gastric ultrasound examinations were performed preoperatively and postoperatively on forty-one patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery. Gastric cross-sectional area (CSA) was measured, in order to estimate the gastric volume. The data obtained were used to evaluate a possible relationship between delayed gastric emptying and postoperative adverse event. Gastric antrum detection rate varied from 31.8% in open up to 78.9% in laparoscopic surgeries (p = 0.003). Six patients experienced adverse outcomes, had an antiemetic therapy administered and/or a nasogastric tube inserted. Mean CSA was significantly higher in this group (12.95 cm2 vs 6.12 cm2; p = 0.040). Sensitivity of gastric ultrasound varies depending on surgical technique. A dilated gastric antrum is significantly related to postoperative adverse outcomes and a careful ultrasound follow-up might help tailor postoperative nutrition and antiemetic therapy. In patients who experienced adverse events, antral CSA showed an average increase of more than 50% over a period of 72 h after surgery. A relative measure could be used to predict the risk of postoperative ileus. Overall, gastric ultrasound seems to be a promising diagnostic tool and a useful way to integrate ERAS® protocol in emergency abdominal surgery."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is the most common reason children undergo emergency general surgery. Worse appendicitis outcomes have been demonstrated in rural, lower socioeconomic, and indigenous populations. These findings are hypothesised to be a result of differential access and delay in presentation to hospital. However, no qualitative study has investigated why prehospital delay may exist. We conducted individual, semi-structured interviews with the parents of 11 rural children who presented with acute appendicitis between June 2019-January 2020. Utilising grounded theory methodology, we created an exploratory framework. Participating families travelled a mean distance of 50.4 km to access hospital, and the median prehospital symptom duration was 42 h. Families with reduced financial or social resources were more likely to 'watch and wait' due to the increased relative burden of access. Key considerations were travel, organising childcare and parental income loss in a rural environment. Structural healthcare barriers further dissuaded prompt access and subsequent engagement. These included poor cultural safety, maldistribution of rural health services, and contradictory public health messages. Several families sought informal community-based health advice to mitigate these barriers, leading to earlier hospital presentation. Prehospital delay in rural families occurred most frequently due to an extended decision-making phase where families evaluated the costs and benefits of accessing hospital-level care. The utilisation of informal community expertise and whānau advocacy helped circumvent reduced access to health facilities. Cultural safety remains problematic and hinders engagement with Māori families."

    "abstract": "The current national burden of emergency general surgery (EGS) illnesses and the extent of surgeon involvement in the care of these patients remain largely unknown. To inform needs assessments, research, and education, we sought to: (1) translate previously developed International Classification of Diseases (ICD), 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes representing EGS conditions to ICD 10th Revision, CM (ICD-10-CM) codes and (2) determine the national burden of and assess surgeon involvement across EGS conditions. We converted ICD-9-CM codes to candidate ICD-10-CM codes using General Equivalence Mappings then iteratively refined the code list. We used National Inpatient Sample 2016 to 2017 data to develop a national estimate of the burden of EGS disease. To evaluate surgeon involvement, using Wisconsin Hospital Association discharge data (January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2018), we selected adult urgent/emergent encounters with an EGS condition as the principal diagnosis. Surgeon involvement was defined as a surgeon being either the attending provider or procedural physician. Four hundred and eighty-five ICD-9-CM codes mapped to 1,696 ICD-10-CM codes. The final list contained 985 ICD-10-CM codes. Nationally, there were 2,977,843 adult patient encounters with an ICD-10-CM EGS diagnosis. Of 94,903 EGS patients in the Wisconsin Hospital Association data set, most encounters were inpatient as compared with observation (75,878 [80.0%] vs. 19,025 [20.0%]). There were 57,780 patients (60.9%) that underwent any procedure. Among all Wisconsin EGS patients, most had no surgeon involvement (64.9% [n = 61,616]). Of the seven most common EGS diagnoses, surgeon involvement was highest for appendicitis (96.0%) and biliary tract disease (77.1%). For the other five most common conditions (skin/soft tissue infections, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, intestinal obstruction/ileus, pancreatitis, diverticular disease), surgeons were involved in roughly 20% of patient care episodes. Surgeon involvement for EGS conditions ranges from highly likely (appendicitis) to relatively unlikely (skin/soft tissue infections). The wide range in surgeon involvement underscores the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration in the care of EGS patients. Prognostic/epidemiological, Level III."

    "abstract": "The need to care for patients with emergency symptoms still continues during the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of emergency surgery procedures performed in Spanish hospitals decreased significantly during the first wave of COVID-19. We performed a retrospective cohort study comparing the emergency surgery activity in a Spanish tertiary Hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic and emergency surgery activity registered in 2019 during the equivalent time period. A total of 1802 patients were included in control group (CG) versus 756 in pandemic group (PG). Mean number of patients who underwent emergency surgery during the control and pandemic periods was 3.42 patients per day, in contrast to 1.62 during the pandemic period, which represents a 52.6% decrease in emergency surgery activity. During the pandemic period, most of the patients consulted after more than 72 h of symptoms, representing a delay in presenting in the ER of 23.7% when compared to CG. Surgeries due to complications from previous elective procedures decreased (12% vs. 6.1%) in PG, probably because elective procedures are being postponed. We had a 13.1% COVID-19 positivity rate. Morbidity was higher during pandemic (52.5% vs. 35.2%). Mortality rates in patients undergoing emergency surgery was higher in PG (12.1% vs. 4.8%). The impact of the first wave of COVID-19 in emergency surgery activity has been profound. A significant reduction in emergency surgery was observed, along with longer time periods between patients' onset of symptoms and their arrival at the Emergency Department. Higher morbidity was also observed during the pandemic period."

    "abstract": "Structural factors limiting access to surgical care require elucidation. We hypothesize transportation time to hospitals with surgical capacity disproportionately burdens minority populations. We identified hospitals with surgical capacity within a 20-mile radius of our city center. Using geocoding, we estimated travel times from each census tract to the nearest facility by car or public bus. For 143 tracts within the county, drive time was 13 ± 4 min and bus time was 33 ± 15 min. Only 41.2% of the population had a facility within 30 min by bus; access was further diminished for those with minority race/ethnicity and/or no insurance. Bus time was associated with percent minority population in a census tract: for each 10% increase in minority population there was a 4.3-min increase in bus time (p < 0.001) when controlling for socioeconomic status and other characteristics. Geographic information systems analysis has potential to identify communities with disproportionate burden to access surgical services."

    "abstract": "To systematically evaluate the spectrum of models providing dedicated resources for emergency urological patients (EUPs). A search of Cochrane, Embase, Medline and grey literature from January 1, 2000 to March 26, 2019 was performed using methods pre-published on PROSPERO. Reporting followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and meta-analysis guidelines. Eligible studies were articles or abstracts published in English describing dedicated models of care for EUPs, which reported at least one secondary outcome. Studies were excluded if they examined pathways dedicated only to single presentations, such as torsion, or outpatient solutions, such as rapid access clinics. The primary outcome was the spectrum of models. Secondary outcomes were time-to-theatre, length of stay, complications and cost. Seven studies were identified, totalling 487 patients. Six studies were conference abstracts, while one study was of full-text length but published in grey literature. Four distinct models were described. These included consultant urologists allocated solely to the care of EUPs (\"Acute Urological Unit\") or dedicated registrars or operating theatres (\"Hybrid structures\"). In some services, EUPs bypassed emergency department assessment and were referred directly to urology (\"Urological Assessment Unit\") or were managed by other dedicated means. Allocating services to EUPs was associated with reduced time-to-theatre, length of stay and hospital cost, and improved supervision of junior medical staff. Multiple dedicated models of care exist for EUPs. Low-level evidence suggests these may improve outcomes for patients, staff and hospitals. Higher quality studies are required to explore patient outcomes and minimum requirements to establish these models."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) patients presenting at tertiary care hospitals may bypass local hospitals with adequate resources. However, many tertiary care hospitals frequently operate at capacity. We hypothesized that understanding patient geographic origin could identify opportunities for enhanced system triage and optimization and be an important first step for EGS regionalization and care coordination that could potentially lead to improved utilization of resources. We analyzed patient zip code and categorized EGS patients who were cared for at our tertiary care hospital as potentially divertible if the southern region hospital was geographically closer to their home, regional hospital admission (RHA) patients, or local admission (LA) patients if the tertiary care facility was closer. Baseline characteristics and outcomes were compared for RHA and LA patients. Of 14 714 EGS patients presenting to the tertiary care hospital, 30.2% were categorized as RHA patients. Overall, 1526 (10.4%) patients required an operation including 527 (34.5%) patients who were potentially divertible. Appendectomy and cholecystectomy comprised 66% of the operations for potentially divertible patients. Length of stay was not significantly different (P = .06) for RHA patients, but they did have lower measured short-term and long-term mortality when compared to their LA counterparts (P < .05). EGS diagnoses and patient geocode analysis can identify opportunities to optimize regional operating room and bed utilization. Understanding where EGS patients are cared for and factors that influenced care facility will be critical for next steps in developing EGS regionalization within our system."

    "abstract": "There is a significant mortality burden associated with emergency general surgery (EGS) procedures. The objective of this study was to develop and validate the use of a machine learning approach to predict mortality following EGS. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried for patients who underwent EGS between 2012 and 2017. We developed a machine learning algorithm to predict mortality following EGS and compared its performance with existing risk-prediction models of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, American College of Surgeon Surgical Risk Calculator (ACS-SRC), and the modified frailty index (mFI) using the area under receiver operative curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). The machine learning algorithm had a very high performance for predicting mortality following EGS, and it had superior performance compared to the ASA classification, ACS-SRC, and the mFI, as measured by the AUC, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV. Machine learning approaches may be a promising tool to predict outcomes for EGS, aiding clinicians in surgical decision-making and counseling of patients and family, improving clinical outcomes by identifying modifiable risk factors than can be optimized, and decreasing treatment costs through resource allocation."

    "abstract": "There has been concern expressed amongst the medical educational community regarding the readiness of general surgery residents in the United States to be competent practicing attendings upon graduation and that limited autonomy may be a contributing factor to this unpreparedness. The purpose of this study was to evaluate an RRC-accredited general surgery residency chief resident acute care surgery service with indirect supervision of cases in terms of safety and outcomes compared to traditional general surgeon cases with direct supervision. The study focused on common general surgical procedures, specifically cholecystectomies, appendectomies, and inguinal and ventral hernia repairs. A retrospective review was conducted of patient data from August 2016 to June 2018 to review all patients 16 years old and older who had received one of the following procedures: appendectomy, cholecystectomy, inguinal hernia repair, or ventral hernia repair. Patient characteristics, procedure type, procedure time, estimated blood loss, complications, length of hospital stay, 30-day readmission, 30-day ED visit, need for reoperation, and mortality were compared between attending direct supervision and chief resident indirect supervision surgery services. A single institution associated with a community based-university associated hybrid general surgery residency was included in this study. Patients aged 16 years or older who underwent one of the operations of interest and were discharged between the dates of August 2016 and June 2018. The operations were performed by, or indirectly supervised by, attendings who were both private surgeons and also covered the chief resident service. A total of 1000 cases were reviewed, with a total of 960 included in the final data after exclusions applied. Of the 960 cases included, 68.4% were traditional attending surgeon cases with direct supervision and 31.6% were chief resident service cases with indirect supervision. A total of 161 appendectomies, 396 cholecystectomies, 201 inguinal hernias and 202 ventral hernias were included. Overall, patients in the chief resident service were more often minorities (27.7 vs. 9.4%, p < 0.001), female (56.4 vs. 44.6%, p = 0.001), younger (40 vs. 55 years, p < 0.001), had a higher BMI (31.2 vs. 29.6, p = 0.018), and a lower ASA class (class 1+2 was 86.4 vs. 65.6%, p < 0.001). The median Charleson Comorbidity Index of the chief resident service patients was lower than that of the attending service (0 vs. 2, p < 0.001). Chief resident service cases were also more often urgent cases (40.6 vs. 22.8%, p < 0.001). Overall, the 30-day complication rate was similar between the two services (5.6 vs. 5.8%, p = 1.000). Complications observed from chief resident service and attending service supervised cases included pneumonia (0.3 vs. 0.5%, p = 1.000), surgical site infection (2.3 vs. 1.5%, p = 0.389), UTI (1.0 vs. 0.6%, p = 0.685), acute kidney injury (0.0 vs. 0.8%, p = 0.333), small bowel obstruction (0.0 vs. 0.6%, p = 0.314), cerebrovascular accident (0.0 vs. 0.2%, p = 1.000), and hematoma/seroma (2.3 vs. 1.7%, p = 0.500). There were no statistically significant differences in procedure-specific complications between services. There was one 30-day mortality in the study population, in the attending service group. This study's data suggest that a chief resident acute care surgery service with indirect supervision of cases is safe in this community with regards to appendectomies, cholecystectomies and hernia repairs."

Cross-sectional study from September 1, 2013 to May 31, 2017. University teaching hospital. Four hundred seventy-four dogs and 66 cats that underwent emergency general surgery (gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, urogenital, soft tissue traumatic injury, splenectomy/excision of bleeding abdominal tumor, surgical revision, and negative exploratory categories) with the emergency surgery service. All patients were required to have complete medical records. None. Study animals were grouped as exposed or not exposed to after-hours emergency surgery. They were further classified as either postoperatively dead or suffering morbidity (yes or no). Additional exposure factors (eg, age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiology [ASA] status) were investigated. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify and quantify any associations with mortality or morbidity. In dogs, exposure to after-hours emergency general surgery was not associated with mortality or morbidity. In dogs, both mortality and morbidity were associated with ASA status. In cats, mortality was not examined because the number of dead cats was small (n = 5). The odds of morbidity were 3.4 times lower (1/0.29) in cats having emergency surgery after hours, compared to cats admitted during regular hours (odds ratio [OR], 0.29; 95% Confidence Interval (CI), 0.09-0.93; P = 0.03). No other investigated exposure factors were associated with morbidity in study cats. After-hours emergency surgery in dogs was not associated with increased risk of mortality and morbidity at the study facility. Feline patients having emergency surgery during regular hospital hours had a higher risk of morbidity; further investigation of modifiable risk factors is warranted."

We recruited 75 patients in Group A (2020) and 165 patients in Group B (2019). There was a reduction in hospitalizations for non-trauma disease (69 in group A and 122 in group B with p: 0.001), a reduction in transfers from other hospitals (2 patients in group A and 17 in group B with p. 0.04) and a reduction in hospitalizations for trauma disease (6 in group A and 43 in group B with p: 0.001). The severity of the disease in 2020 was greater than in the same period in 2019 and there was a higher rate of high-grade complications CONCLUSION: From data analysis, we conclude that there has been a reduction in hospitalizations and surgical interventions in our emergency surgery department.

    "abstract": "Frailty has been recognized as an independent risk factor for inferior outcomes, but its effect on emergency general surgery (EGS) is understudied. The purpose of the present study was to define the impact of frailty on risk-adjusted mortality, non-home discharge, and readmission following EGS operations. Adults undergoing appendectomy, cholecystectomy, small bowel resection, large bowel resection, repair of perforated ulcer, or laparotomy within two days of an urgent admission were identified in the 2016-2017 Nationwide Readmissions Database. Frailty was defined using diagnosis codes corresponding to the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups frailty indicator. Multivariable regression was used to study in-hospital mortality and non-home discharge by operation, and Kaplan Meier analysis to study freedom from unplanned readmission at up to 90-days follow-up. Among 655,817 patients, 11.9% were considered frail. Frail patients most commonly underwent large bowel resection (37.3%) and cholecystectomy (29.2%). After adjustment, frail patients had higher mortality rates for all operations compared to nonfrail, including those most commonly performed (11.9% [95% CI 11.4-12.5%] vs 6.0% [95% CI 5.8-6.3%] for large bowel resection; 2.3% [95% CI 2.0-2.6%] vs 0.2% [95% CI 0.2-0.2%] for cholecystectomy). Adjusted non-home discharge rates were higher for frail compared to nonfrail patients following all operations, including large bowel resection (68.1% [95% CI 67.1-69.0%] vs 25.9% [95% CI 25.2-26.5%]) and cholecystectomy (33.7% [95% CI 32.7-34.7%] vs 2.9% [95% CI 2.8-3.0%]). Adjusted hospitalization costs were nearly twice as high for frail patients. On Kaplan-Meier analysis, frail patients had greater unplanned readmissions (log rank P<0.001), with 1 in 4 rehospitalized within 90 days. Frail patients have inferior clinical outcomes and greater resource use following EGS, with the greatest absolute differences following complex operations. Simple frailty assessments may inform expectations, identify patients at risk of poor outcomes, and guide the need for more intensive postoperative care."

However, it has been validated only in the U.S. We aimed to prospectively validate ESS in a Greek patient population. All patients who underwent an emergent laparotomy were prospectively included over a 15-month period. A systematic chart review was performed to collect relevant preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables based on which the ESS was calculated for each patient. The relationship between ESS and 30-day mortality, morbidity (i.e., the occurrence of at least one complication), and the need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission was evaluated and compared between the Greek and U.S. patients using the c-statistics methodology. The study was registered on \"Research Registry\" with the unique identifying number 5901. A total of 214 patients (102 Greek) were included. The mean age was 64 years, 44% were female, and the median ESS was 7. The most common indication for surgery was hollow viscus perforation (25%). The ESS reliably and incrementally predicted mortality (c-statistics = 0.79 [95% CI 0.67-0.90] and 0.83 [95% CI 0.74-0.92]), morbidity (c-statistics = 0.83 [95% CI 0.76-0.91] and 0.79 [95% CI 0.69-0.88]), and ICU admission (c-statistics = 0.88 [95% CI 0.81-0.96] and 0.84 [95% CI 0.77-0.91]) in both Greek and U.S. The correlation between the ESS and the surgical outcomes was statistically significant in both Greek and U.S. patients undergoing emergency laparotomy.

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) patients presenting with sepsis remain a challenge. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends a 30 mL/kg fluid bolus in these patients, but recent studies suggest an association between large volume crystalloid resuscitation and increased mortality. The optimal amount of pre-operative fluid resuscitation prior to source control in patients with intra-abdominal sepsis is unknown. This study aims to determine if increasing volume of resuscitation prior to surgical source control is associated with worsening outcomes. We conducted an 8-year retrospective chart review of EGS patients undergoing surgery for abdominal sepsis within 24 h of admission. Patients in hemorrhagic shock and those with outside hospital index surgeries were excluded. We grouped patients by increasing pre-operative resuscitation volume in 10 ml/kg intervals up to > 70 ml/kg and later grouped them into < 30 ml/kg or ≥ 30 ml/kg. A relative risk regression model compared amounts of fluid administration. Mortality was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes were time to operation, ventilator days, and length of stay (LOS). Groups were compared by quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) and SOFA scoring systems. Of the 301 patients included, the mean age was 55, 51% were male, 257 (85%) survived to discharge. With increasing fluid per kg (< 10 to < 70 ml/kg), there was an increasing mortality per decile, 8.8% versus 31.6% (p = 0.004). Patients who received < 30 mL/kg had lower mortality (11.3 vs 21%) than those who received > 30 ml/kg (p = 0.02). These groups had median qSOFA scores (1.0 vs. 1.0, p = 0.06). There were no differences in time to operation (6.1 vs 4.9 h p = 0.11), ventilator days (1 vs 3, p = 0.08), or hospital LOS (8 vs 9 days, p = 0.57). Relative risk regression correcting for age and physiologic factors showed no significant differences in mortality between the fluid groups. Greater pre-operative resuscitation volumes were initially associated with significantly higher mortality, despite similar organ failure scores. However, fluid volumes were not associated with mortality following adjustment for other physiologic factors in a regression model. The amount of pre-operative volume resuscitation was not associated with differences in time to operation, ventilator days, ICU or hospital LOS."

    "abstract": "Background: Comparison of parameters between two or more groups forms the basis of hypothesis testing. Statistical tests (and statistical significance) are designed to report the likelihood the observed results are caused by chance alone, given that the null hypothesis is true. Methods: To demonstrate the concepts described, we utilized the Nationwide Inpatient Sample for patients admitted for emergency general surgery (EGS) and those admitted with non-EGS diagnoses. Depending on the type and distribution of individual variables, appropriate statistical tests were applied. Results: Comparison of numerical variables between two groups is begun with a simple correlation, depicted graphically in a scatterplot, and assessed statistically with either a Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficient. Normality of numerical variables is then assessed and in the case of normality, a t-test is applied when comparing two groups, and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) when comparing three or more groups. For data that are not distributed normally, a Wilcoxon rank sum (Mann-Whitney U) test may be used. For categorical variables, the χ2 test is used, unless cell counts are less than five, in which case the Fisher exact test is used. Importantly, both the ANOVA and χ2 test are used to assess for overall differences between two or more groups. Individual pair comparison tests, as well as adjusting for multiple comparisons must be used to identify differences between two specific groups when there are more than two groups. Conclusion: A basic understanding of statistical significance, and the type and distribution of variables is necessary to select the appropriate statistical test to compare data. Failure to understand these concepts may result in spurious conclusions."

Results: Variables are categorized as either categorical or numerical. Within the former, there are ordinal and or nominal subtypes; within the latter, there are ratio and interval subtypes. Categorical data are typically displayed as number (%). Numerical data must be assessed for normality as normally distributed data behave in certain patterns that allow for specific statistical tests to be used. Several properties exist for numerical data, including measurements of central tendency (mean, median, and mode), as well as standard deviation, range, and interquartile range. The best initial assessment of the distribution of numerical data is graphical with both histograms and box plots.

We sought to characterize the association between general surgery patient volume and operative intervention at a tertiary hospital in Malawi, which has an adequate surgical workforce. We analyzed patients admitted to Kamuzu Central Hospital Lilongwe, Malawi, with a general surgery complaint from 2018-2020. We examined the relationship between the census at the time of admission, the use of operative intervention, and the time to operative intervention. The patient census was defined as low (≤30 patients), medium (31-49 patients), and high (≥50 patients), based on historical patterns. 2,701 patients were included. The mean daily census was 46 patients (SD 10). For the medium and high census, the adjusted risk ratio of undergoing surgery was 0.86 (95% CI 0.78, 0.95) and 0.81 (95% CI 0.73, 0.90), respectively, adjusted for admission diagnosis. For patients requiring urgent abdominal exploration, at a census of 25, the adjusted mean time to operation was 0.8 days (95% CI 0.1, 1.5) compared to 2.8 days (95% CI 2.1, 3.5) at a census of 65 patients. Despite an adequate surgical workforce, an increasing mean daily census significantly reduced the use of operative intervention and increased time to operation for patients who needed urgent abdominal exploration. Additional improvements in the surgical ecosystem beyond surgeons are necessary to improve surgical access."

Methamphetamines have also been shown to alter the immune response. These effects could predispose METH users to poor wound healing, increased infections, and other post-operative complications. We hypothesized that METH users would have longer length of stay and higher rates of complications compared to non-METH users. The trauma registry for our urban Level 1 trauma center was searched for patients that received an exploratory laparotomy from 2016 to 2019. A total 204 patients met criteria and 52 (25.5%) were METH positive. Length of stay (LOS), ventilator days, abbreviated injury scale (AIS), and wound class were compared using nonparametric statistics. Age and injury severity score (ISS) were compared using a Student's t-test. A Chi Square or Fisher's Exact test was used to compare sex, mechanism of injury, and rates of infectious complications. Methamphetamine-positive patients had a significantly higher rate of surgical site infections (7.4% versus 0%, P = 0.001). Patients that developed surgical site infection had equivalent rates of smoking and diabetes, as well as equivalent abdominal AIS and wound class compared to those who did not develop surgical site infection. Hospital and ICU LOS, ventilator days, ISS, and mortality were equivalent between METH positive and negative patients. Rates of other infectious complications were the same between groups. Methamphetamine use is associated with an increased rate of surgical site infection after trauma laparotomy. Other serious complications and mortality were not affected by METH use."

While such patients have a high risk of in-hospital mortality, long-term outcomes in this group are not well described, which may have implications for goals of care discussions. In this study, we evaluate long-term survival among nursing home residents admitted for EGS conditions. We performed a population-based, retrospective cohort study of nursing home residents (65 years or older) admitted for one of eight EGS diagnoses (appendicitis, cholecystitis, strangulated hernia, bowel obstruction, diverticulitis, peptic ulcer disease, intestinal ischemia, or perforated viscus) from 2006 to 2018 in a large regional health system. The primary outcome was 1-year survival. To ascertain the effect of EGS admission independent of baseline characteristics, patients were matched to nursing home residents without an EGS admission based on demographics and baseline health. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate survival across groups. A total of 7,942 nursing home residents (mean age, 85 years) were admitted with an EGS diagnosis and matched to controls. One quarter of patients underwent surgery, and 18% died in hospital. At 1 year, 55% of cases were alive, compared with 72% of controls (p < 0.001). Among those undergoing surgery, 61% were alive at 1 year, compared with 72% of controls (p < 0.001). The 1-year survival probability was 57% in patients who did not require mechanical ventilation, 43% in those who required 1 to 2 days of ventilation, and 30% in those who required ≥3 days of ventilation. Although their risk of in-hospital mortality is high, most nursing home residents admitted for an EGS diagnosis survive at least 1 year. While nursing home residents presenting with an EGS diagnosis should be cited realistic odds for the risk of death, long-term survival is achievable in the majority of these patients.

    "abstract": "Acute surgical assessment units (ASAUs) aim to optimise management of surgical patients compared to the traditional 'on-call' emergency department (ED) system. Acute appendicitis (AA) is the most common acute surgical condition requiring emergency surgery. We set out to assess if the ASAU improved care provided to patients with AA compared to those managed through the ED. Patients admitted via the ED with AA in the 6 months prior to opening the ASAU were compared to those admitted via the ASAU in the first six months following its implementation. Relevant data was collected on key performance indicators from their charts. In the ASAU cohort, the mean time to be seen was one hour less than the ED cohort (21 min vs 74 min). The mean time to surgery was also 8.8 h shorter. Most patients in the ASAU group (78.6%) underwent surgery during the day, compared to 40.3% of ED patients. The ASAU patients also had a lower postoperative complication rate (0.9% vs 3.9%), as well as a lower negative appendicectomy rate (14.2% vs 18.6%) and lower conversion-to-open surgery rate. Greater consultant supervision and presence was observed. The ASAU has resulted in better outcomes for patients with AA than those admitted via ED. More operations were performed in safer daytime hours with greater consultant presence, allowing for improved senior support for trainee surgeons. Our study supports the role of the ASAU in improving the quality and efficiency of emergency general surgery."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the relationship between availability of round-the-clock (RTC) in-house intensivists and patient outcomes in people who underwent surgery for a life-threatening emergency general surgery (LT-EGS) disease such as necrotizing soft-tissue infection, ischemic enteritis, perforated viscus, and toxic colitis. Data on hospital-level critical care structures and processes from a 2015 survey of 2,811 US hospitals were linked to patient-level data from 17 State Inpatient Databases. Patients who were admitted with a primary diagnosis code for an LT-EGS disease of interest and underwent surgery on date of admission were included in analyses. We identified 3,620 unique LT-EGS admissions at 368 hospitals. At 66% (n = 243) of hospitals, 83.5% (n = 3,021) of patients were treated at hospitals with RTC intensivist-led care. These facilities were more likely to have in-house respiratory therapists and protocols to ensure availability of blood products or adherence to Surviving Sepsis Guidelines. When accounting for other key factors including overnight surgeon availability, perioperative staffing, and annual emergency general surgery case volume, not having a protocol to ensure adherence to Surviving Sepsis Guidelines (adjusted odds ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-3.94) was associated with increased odds of mortality. Our results suggest that focused treatment of sepsis along with surgical source control, rather than RTC intensivist presence, is key feature of optimizing EGS patient outcomes.

    "abstract": "Damage control surgery (DCS) with temporary abdominal closure (TAC) is increasingly utilized in emergency general surgery (EGS). As the population ages, more geriatric patients (GP) are undergoing EGS operations. Concern exists for GP's ability to tolerate DCS. We hypothesize that DCS in GP does not increase morbidity or mortality and has similar rates of primary closure compared to non-geriatric patients (NGP). A retrospective chart review from 2014-2020 was conducted on all non-trauma EGS patients who underwent DCS with TAC. Demographics, admission lab values, fluid amounts, length of stay (LOS), timing of closure, post-operative complications and mortality were collected. GP were compared to NGP and results were analyzed using Chi square and Wilcox signed rank test. Ninety-eight patients (n = 50, <65 y; n = 48, ≥65 y) met inclusion criteria. There was no significant difference in median number of operations (3 versus 2), time to primary closure (2.5 versus 3 d), hospital LOS (19 versus 17.5 d), ICU LOS (11 versus 8 d), rate of primary closure (66% versus 56%), post op ileus (44% versus 48%), abscess (14% versus 10%), need for surgery after closure (32% versus 19%), anastomotic dehiscence (16% versus 6%), or mortality (34% versus 42%). Average time until take back after index procedure did not vary significantly between young and elderly group (45.8 versus 38.5 h; P = 0.89). GP were more likely to have hypertension (83% versus 50%; P ≤ 0.05), atrial fibrillation (25% versus 4%; P ≤ 0.05) and lower median heart rate compared to NGP (90 versus 103; P ≤ 0.05). DCS with TAC in geriatric EGS patients achieves similar outcomes and mortality to younger patients. Indication, not age, should factor into the decision to perform DCS."

We sought to determine the rate of overall and nonindex hospital readmissions at 30 and 90 days after discharge for EGS diagnoses, hypothesizing a significant portion would be to nonindex hospitals. The 2013 to 2014 Nationwide Readmissions Database was queried for all patients 16 years or older admitted with an EGS primary diagnosis and survived index hospitalization. Multivariable logistic regression identified risk factors for nonelective 30- and 90-day readmission to index and nonindex hospitals. Of 4,171,983 patients, 13% experienced unplanned readmission at 30 days. Of these, 21% were admitted to a nonindex hospital. By 90 days, 22% experienced an unplanned readmission, of which 23% were to a nonindex hospital. The most common reason for readmission was infection. Publicly insured or uninsured patients accounted for 67% of admissions and 77% of readmissions. Readmission predictors at 30 days included leaving against medical advice (odds ratio [OR], 2.51 [2.47-2.56]), increased length of stay (4-7 days: OR, 1.42 [1.41-1.43]; >7 days: OR, 2.04 [2.02-2.06]), Charlson Comorbidity Index ≥2 (OR, 1.72 [1.71-1.73]), public insurance (Medicare: OR, 1.45 [1.44-1.46]; Medicaid: OR, 1.38 [1.37-1.40]), EGS patients who fell into the \"Other\" surgical category (OR, 1.42 [1.38-1.48]), and nonroutine discharge. Risk factors for readmission remained consistent at 90 days. Given that nonindex hospital EGS readmission accounts for nearly a quarter of readmissions and often related to important benchmarks such as infection, current EGS quality metrics are inaccurate. This has implications for policy, benchmarking, and readmission reduction programs. Epidemiological study, level III."

We sought to compare cancer care quality between patients receiving emergency versus elective surgery. We conducted an institutional retrospective matched (46 elective:23 emergency; n = 69) case control study. Patients who underwent a colon cancer resection from January 2017 to February 2019 were matched by age, sex, and cancer stage. Data were collected through the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program and chart review. Process outcomes of interest included receipt of cross-sectional imaging, CEA testing, pre-operative cancer diagnosis, pre-operative colonoscopy, margin status, nodal yield, pathology reporting, and oncology referral. No differences were found between elective and emergency groups with respect to demographics, margin status, nodal yield, oncology referral times/rates, or time to pathology reporting. Patients undergoing emergency surgery were less likely to have CEA levels, CT staging, and colonoscopy (p = 0.004, p = 0.017, p < 0.001). Emergency cases were less likely to be approached laparoscopically (p = 0.03), and patients had a longer length of stay (p < 0.001) and 30-day readmission rate (p = 0.01). Patients undergoing emergency surgery receive high quality resections and timely post-operative referrals but receive inferior peri-operative workup. The adoption of a hybrid acute care surgery model including short-interval follow-up with a surgical oncologist or colorectal surgeon may improve the quality of care that patients with colon cancer receive after acute presentations. Surgeons treating patients with colon cancer emergently can improve their care quality by ensuring that appropriate and timely disease evaluation is completed."

The aim of this study was to compare the activity of our EGS service before and after these changes. Patients referred by the emergency department were identified prospectively over a 4-week period beginning from the date our EGS service was reconfigured (COVID) and compared with patients identified retrospectively from the same period the previous year (Pre-COVID), and followed up for 30 days. Data were extracted from handover documents and electronic care records. The primary outcomes were the rate of admission, ambulation and discharge. There were 281 and 283 patients during the Pre-COVID and COVID periods respectively. Admission rate decreased from 78.7% to 41.7%, while there were increased rates of ambulation from 7.1% to 17.3% and discharge from 6% to 22.6% (all p<0.001). For inpatients, mean duration of admission decreased (6.9 to 4.8 days), and there were fewer operative or endoscopic interventions (78 to 40). There were increased ambulatory investigations (11 to 39) and telephone reviews (0 to 39), while early computed tomography scan was increasingly used to facilitate discharge (5% vs 34.7%). There were no differences in 30-day readmission or mortality. Restructuring of our EGS service in response to COVID-19 facilitated an increased use of ambulatory services and imaging, achieving a decrease of 952 inpatient bed days in this critical period, while maintaining patient safety."

Presentations to the emergency department (ED) for GSEs fell during the early COVID-19 pandemic. Barriers to accessing care may be heightened, especially for vulnerable populations, and patients delaying care raises public health concerns. We included adult patients with ED presentations for potential GSEs at a single quaternary-care hospital from January 2018 to August 2020. To compare GSE volumes in total and by subgroup, an interrupted time-series analysis was performed using the March shelter-in-place order as the start of the COVID-19 period. Bivariate analysis was used to compare demographics and disease severity. 3255 patients (28/week) presented with potential GSEs before COVID-19, while 546 (23/week) presented during COVID-19. When shelter-in-place started, presentations fell by 8.7/week (31%) from the previous week (p<0.001), driven by decreases in peritonitis (β=-2.76, p=0.017) and gallbladder disease (β=-2.91, p=0.016). During COVID-19, patients were younger (54 vs 57, p=0.001), more often privately insured (44% vs 38%, p=0.044), and fewer required interpreters (12% vs 15%, p<0.001). Fewer patients presented with sepsis during the pandemic (15% vs 20%, p=0.009) and the average severity of illness decreased (p<0.001). Length of stay was shorter during the COVID-19 period (3.91 vs 5.50 days, p<0.001). GSE volumes and severity fell during the pandemic.

The Emergency Surgery Score is easily calculated using multiple demographic, comorbidity, laboratory, and acuity of disease variables. We aimed to investigate whether the Emergency Surgery Score can predict 30-day postoperative mortality across patients undergoing emergency surgery in multiple surgical specialties. Our study is a retrospective cohort study using data from the national American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (2007-2017). We included patients that underwent emergency gynecologic, urologic, thoracic, neurosurgical, orthopedic, vascular, cardiac, and general surgical procedures. The Emergency Surgery Score was calculated for each patient, and the correlation between the Emergency Surgery Score and 30-day mortality was assessed for each specialty using the c-statistics methodology. Of 6,485,915 patients, 173,890 patients were included. The mean age was 60 years, 50.6% were female patients, and the overall mortality was 9.7%. The Emergency Surgery Score predicted mortality best in emergency gynecologic, general, and urologic surgery (c-statistics: 0.97, 0.87, 0.81, respectively). The Emergency Surgery Score predicted mortality moderately well in emergency thoracic, neurosurgical, orthopedic, and vascular surgery (c-statistics 0.73-0.79). For example, the mortality of gynecology patients with an Emergency Surgery Score of 5, 9, and 13 was 2%, 27%, and 50%, respectively. The Emergency Surgery Score performed poorly in cardiac surgery. The Emergency Surgery Score accurately predicts mortality across patients undergoing emergency surgery in multiple surgical specialties, especially general, gynecologic, and urologic surgery. The Emergency Surgery Score can prove useful for perioperative patient counseling and for benchmarking the quality of surgical care."

Surgical dogma preaches practices such as peritoneal drain placement, prolonged nil per os, and routine postoperative enteral contrast imaging despite a lack of evidence. We aimed to evaluate the role of postoperative enteral contrast imaging in postoperative perforated peptic ulcer care. Our primary objective was to assess effects of routine postoperative enteral contrast imaging on early detection of clinically significant leaks. We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent repair of perforated peptic ulcer between July 2016 and June 2018. We compared outcomes between those who underwent routine postoperative enteral contrast imaging and those who did not. Our analysis included 95 patients who underwent primary/omental patch repair. The mean age was 60 years, and 54% were male. Thirteen (14%) had a leak. Eighty percent of patients had a drain placed. Nine patients had leaks diagnosed based on bilious drain output without routine postoperative enteral contrast imaging. Use of routine postoperative enteral contrast imaging varied significantly between institutions (30%-87%). Two late leaks after initial normal postoperative enteral contrast imaging were confirmed by imaging after a clinical change triggered the second study. Two patients had contained leaks identified by routine postoperative enteral contrast imaging but remained clinically well. Duration of hospital stay was longer in those who received routine postoperative enteral contrast imaging (12 vs 6 days, median; P = .000). Routine postoperative enteral contrast imaging after perforated peptic ulcer repair likely does not improve the detection of clinically significant leaks and is associated with increased duration of hospital stay."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery conditions are common, require urgent surgical evaluation, and are associated with high mortality and costs. Although appropriate interhospital transfers are critical to successful emergency general surgery care, the performance of emergency general surgery transfer systems remains unclear. We aimed to describe emergency general surgery transfer patterns and identify factors associated with potentially avoidable transfers. We performed a retrospective cohort study of emergency general surgery episodes in 8 US states using the 2016 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient and Emergency Department Databases and the American Hospital Association Annual Surveys. We identified Emergency Department-to-Inpatient and Inpatient-to-Inpatient interhospital emergency general surgery transfers. Potentially avoidable transfers were defined as discharge within 72 hours after transfer without undergoing any procedure or operation at the destination hospital. We examined transfer incidence and characteristics. We performed multilevel regression examining patient-level and hospital-level factors associated with potentially avoidable transfers. Of 514,410 adult emergency general surgery episodes, 26,281 (5.1%) involved interhospital transfers (Emergency Department-to-Inpatient: 65.0%, Inpatient-to-Inpatient: 35.1%). Over 1 in 4 transfers were potentially avoidable (7,188, 27.4%), with the majority occurring from the emergency department. Factors associated with increased odds of potentially avoidable transfers included self-pay (versus government insurance, odds ratio: 1.26, 95% confidence interval: 1.09-1.45, P = .002), level 1 trauma centers (versus non-trauma centers, odds ratio: 1.24, 95% confidence interval: 1.05-1.47, P = .01), and critical access hospitals (versus non-critical access, odds ratio: 1.30, 95% confidence interval: 1.15-1.47, P < .001). Hospital-level factors (size, trauma center, ownership, critical access, location) accounted for 36.1% of potentially avoidable transfers variability. Over 1 in 4 emergency general surgery transfers are potentially avoidable. Understanding factors associated with potentially avoidable transfers can guide research, quality improvement, and infrastructure development to optimize emergency general surgery care."

While public health guidelines advised continued provision of timely care for patients, disruption of safety-net health care and public fear have been proposed to be related to indirect deaths because of delays in presentation. We hypothesized that admissions for emergency general surgery (EGS) diagnoses would decrease during the pandemic and that mortality for these patients would increase. A multicenter observational study comparing EGS admissions from January to May 2020 to 2018 and 2019 across 11 NYC hospitals in the largest public health care system in the United States was performed. Emergency general surgery diagnoses were defined using International Classification Diseases, Tenth Revision, codes and grouped into seven common diagnosis categories: appendicitis, cholecystitis, small/large bowel, peptic ulcer disease, groin hernia, ventral hernia, and necrotizing soft tissue infection. Baseline demographics were compared including age, race/ethnicity, and payor status. Outcomes included coronavirus disease (COVID) status and mortality. A total of 1,376 patients were admitted for EGS diagnoses from January to May 2020, a decrease compared with both 2018 (1,789) and 2019 (1,668) (p < 0.0001). This drop was most notable after the stay-at-home mandate (March 22, 2020; week 12). From March to May 2020, 3.3%, 19.2%, and 6.0% of EGS admissions were incidentally COVID positive, respectively. Mortality increased in March to May 2020 compared with 2019 (2.2% vs. 0.7%); this difference was statistically significant between April 2020 and April 2019 (4.1% vs. 0.9%, p = 0.045). Supporting our hypothesis, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and subsequent stay-at-home mandate resulted in decreased EGS admissions between March and May 2020 compared with prior years. During this time, there was also a statistically significant increase in mortality, which peaked at the height of COVID infection rates in our population. Epidemiological, level IV."

Herein, we evaluate resource utilization, outcomes, and healthcare costs associated with unplanned surgery admissions during the height of the pandemic in 2020 versus the same period in 2019. Retrospective analysis on patients ≥18 years admitted from the emergency department to General & Digestive and Gastrointestinal Surgery Services between February and May 2019 and 2020 at our center; clinical outcomes and unadjusted and adjusted per-person healthcare costs were analyzed. Consults and admissions to surgery declined between February and May 2020 by 37% and 19%, respectively, relative to the same period in 2019, with even greater relative decline during late March and early April. Time between onset of symptoms to diagnosis increased from 2±3 days 2019 to 5±22 days 2020 (P = 0.01). Overall hospital stay was two days less in 2020 (P = 0.19).

The FTP group enrolled 89 patients, and 76 controls prior to FTP implementation were evaluated. Time to surgery (TTS), LOS, and post-operative LOS between groups were compared. Direct costs, reimbursements, and patient reported satisfaction (satisfaction 1 = never, 4 = always) were also studied. The sample was 60.6% female, with a median age of 40 years. Case distribution differed slightly (56.2% versus 42.1% LA, 40.4% versus 57.9% LC, FTP versus control), but TTS was similar between groups (11h39min versus 10h02min, P = 0.633). LOS was significantly shorter in the FTP group (15h17min versus 29h09min, P < 0.001), reflected by shorter post-operative LOS (3h11min versus 20h10min, P< 0.001), fewer patients requiring a hospital bed and overnight stay (P < 0.001). Direct costs were significantly lower in the FTP group, reimbursements were similar (P < 0.001 and P = 0.999 respectively), and average patient reported satisfaction was good (3.3/4). In an era focused on decreasing cost, optimizing resources, and ensuring patient satisfaction, a FTP can play a significant role in EGS. At an AMC, an EGS FTP significantly decreased LOS, hospital bed utilization while not impacting reimbursement or patient satisfaction."

We implemented a multidisciplinary critical care outpatient clinic (CCOC) to identify the occurrence of PICS in SICU survivors. Seventy acute care surgery and trauma patients, 18 years or older, who remained in the SICU for 72 hours or longer at a Level I trauma center were seen in CCOC at 2 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after hospital discharge. The CCOC staffing included a nurse coordinator, social worker, critical care pharmacist, physical therapist, and acute care surgeon who identified PICS sequelae in their respective specialties by clinical criteria and screening questionnaires. Of 82 eligible patients, 70 (85.4%) were seen at least once for 116 total visits. Forty-three (61.4%) patients suffered traumatic injuries and 27 (38.6%) underwent emergent general surgery. Sixty-seven (95.7%) demonstrated at least one PICS criterion. Over all visits, 26 (37.1%) patients presented with one PICS criterion, 24 (34.3%) patients with two, and 17 (24.3%) with three. Cognitive impairment was observed in 29 (41.4%) patients, psychiatric in 30 (42.9%), and physical symptoms in 65 (92.9%). Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care scores improved from severe impairment at admission to full function by 12 weeks postdischarge, yet 6 Minute Walk Test scores remained below age-matched references through all visits. Patients expressed mild to moderate depression based on Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores. A medication reconciliation was completed at 96.5% (112/116) of the visits with 116 total medication recommendations. By 24 weeks following discharge, only 26.4% (14/53) of previously employed patients had resumed work.

We retrospectively identified patients presenting to our urban, academic hospital with acute appendicitis during a 9-month timeframe (11/2019 - 7/2020). Patients were classified as perforated or non-perforated. Patient SVI was determined using geocoding at the census tract level. Because rates of perforation were higher in older patients, we performed a subset analysis of patients ≥ 40 years. 190 patients were included. Patients with perforated appendicitis (n = 48, 25%) were older and were more likely to present to a clinic versus the emergency department (P = 0.009). Perforated patients had longer delay before seeking care (56% versus 6% with > 72 hours of symptoms, P < 0.001). However, there were no differences between groups in terms of sex, race/ethnicity, insurance type, language barrier, having a primary care physician, or any of the SVI subscales. Of patients ≥ 40 years, a higher proportion were perforated (28/80, 35%) despite similar rates of delayed care. In this cohort, higher overall SVI as well as the socioeconomic status and household composition/disability subscales were associated with perforation. Contrary to our hypothesis, while perforation was associated with delayed care in this population, we did not find overall that social vulnerability or individual social determinants accounted for this delay."

Following multivariate analyses, increasing mFI-5 score was associated with higher odds of FTR (mFI-5 = 1: odds ratio (OR) 1.48, p=0.003; mFI-5 = 2: OR 2.66, p <0.001; mFI-5 ≥ 3: OR 3.97, p <0.001), 30-day complications (mFI-5 = 1: OR 1.46, p <0.001; mFI-5 = 2: OR 2.48, p <0.001; mFI-5≥3: OR 5.01, p <0.001), reoperation (mFI-5 = 1: OR 1.42, p = 0.020; mFI-5 = 2: OR 1.70, p = 0.021; mFI-5 ≥ 3: OR 2.18, p = 0.009) and all-cause mortality (mFI-5 = 1: OR 1.49, p=0.001; mFI-5 = 2: OR 2.67, p <0.001; mFI-5 ≥ 3: 3.96, p <0.001). Increasing frailty in geriatric EGS patients is associated with significantly higher rates of FTR, 30-day complications, reoperations, and all-cause mortality. The mFI-5 score can be used to assess frailty and better anticipate the postoperative course of vulnerable geriatric patients."

    "abstract": "In early 2020, the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) spread rapidly throughout the whole world, causing a massive response in terms of health resource disposal. Moreover, lockdowns were imposed in entire countries. This study aims to assess whether there was a downward trend in emergency general surgery (EGS) procedures accomplished throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and to determine patients' and diseases' characteristics. This is a multicentric retrospective observational cohort analysis conducted on patients who underwent EGS procedures during the lockdown and the same period of the previous year in the three Third Level Hospitals of Friuli Venezia Giulia, Italy. During the study period, 138 patients underwent EGS procedures versus the 197 patients operated on in 2019, meaning a 30.0% decrease in the number of surgeries performed. The incidence rate for EGS procedures was 2.5 surgeries per day during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 3.5 surgeries per day in 2019 (P<0.001). The characteristics of patients operated on in 2020 were comparable to those of patients who underwent EGS in 2019, except for the higher prevalence of male patients during the COVID-19 pandemic (76.8 vs. 55.8; P<0.001). No difference was recorded in disease severity between the two study periods. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant reduction in EGS procedures carried out was recorded. However, no clear explanation can be given to elucidate this fact."

    "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of visits in emergency departments (ED) worldwide decreased significantly based on several studies. This study aims to compare the patient flow in the emergency surgery department during the COVID-19 pandemic and a control period in the emergency department of a public tertiary care hospital in Greece. The overall patient flow reduction regarding the ED visits between the two examined periods was 49.07%. The emergency surgery department's corresponding visits were 235 and 552, respectively, which indicated an overall patient flow decrease of 57.43%. Chi-square analysis showed that age groups and ambulance use had statistically significant associations with the periods examined. An independent samples t-test was applied and deduced that the average patient's age was statistically significantly higher in the COVID-19 pandemic than in the non-pandemic period. By analyzing hospital information system data, useful conclusions can be drawn to prepare a surgical emergency unit better and optimize resource allocation in a healthcare facility in similar critical situations."

    "abstract": "A major incident is any emergency requiring special arrangements by the emergency services. All hospitals are required by law to keep a major incident plan (MIP) detailing the response to such events. In 2006 and 2019, we assessed the preparedness and knowledge of key individuals in hospitals across England and found a substantial gap in responding to the MIP. In this report, we compare responses from doctors at major trauma centres (MTCs) and other hospitals (non-MTCs). We identified trusts in England that received over 30 000 patients through the ED in the fourth quarter of 2016/2017. We contacted the on-call anaesthetic, emergency, general surgery and trauma and orthopaedic registrar at each location and asked three questions assessing their confidence in using their hospital's MIP: (1) Have you read your hospital's MIP? (2) Do you know where you can access your hospital's MIP guidelines? (3) Do you know what role you would play if an MIP came into effect while you are on call?We compared data from MTCs and non-MTCs using multinomial mixed proportional odds models. There was a modest difference between responses from individuals at MTCs and non-MTCs for question 2 (OR=2.43, CI=1.03 to 5.73, p=0.04) but no evidence of a difference between question 1 (OR=1.41, CI=0.55 to 3.63, p=0.47) and question 3 (OR=1.78, CI=0.86 to 3.69, p=0.12). Emergency medicine and anaesthetic registrars showed significantly higher preparedness and knowledge across all domains. No evidence of a systematic difference in specialty response by MTC or otherwise was identified. Confidence in using MIPs among specialty registrars in England remains low. Doctors at MTCs tended to be better prepared and more knowledgeable, but this effect was only marginally significant. We make several recommendations to improve education on major incidents."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) is a high-volume and high-risk surgical service. Interhospital variation in EGS outcomes exists, but there is disagreement in the literature as to whether hospital admission volume affects in-hospital mortality. Scotland collects high-quality data on all admitted patients, whether managed operatively or nonoperatively. Our aim was to determine the relationship between hospital admission volume and in-hospital mortality of EGS patients in Scotland. Second, to investigate whether surgeon admission volume affects mortality. This national population-level cohort study included EGS patients aged 16 years and older, who were admitted to a Scottish hospital between 2014 and 2018 (inclusive). A logistic regression model was created, with in-hospital mortality as the dependent variable, and admission volume of hospital per year as a continuous covariate of interest, adjusted for age, sex, comorbidity, deprivation, surgeon admission volume, surgeon operative rate, transfer status, diagnosis, and operation category. There were 376,076 admissions to 25 hospitals, which met our inclusion criteria. The EGS hospital admission rate per year had no effect on in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.000; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.000-1.000). Higher average surgeon monthly admission volume increased the odds of in-hospital mortality (>35 admissions: OR, 1.139; 95% CI, 1.038-1.250; 25-35 admissions: OR, 1.091; 95% CI, 1.004-1.185; <25 admissions was the referent). In Scotland, in contrast to other settings, EGS hospital admission volume did not influence in-hospital mortality. The finding of an association between individual surgeons' case volume and in-hospital mortality warrants further investigation. Care management, Level IV."

    "abstract": "The acute care surgery (ACS) model has been shown to improve patient, hospital and surgeon-specific outcomes. To date, however, little has been published on its impact on residency training. Our study compared the emergency general surgery (EGS) operative experiences of residents assigned to ACS versus elective surgical rotations. Resident-reported EGS case logs were prospectively collected over a 9-month period across 3 teaching hospitals. Descriptive statistics were tabulated and group comparisons were made using χ2 statistics for categorical data and t tests for continuous data. Overall, 1061 cases were reported. Resident participation exceeded 90%). Appendiceal and biliary disease accounted for 49.7% of EGS cases. Residents on ACS rotations reported participating in twice as many EGS cases per block as residents on elective rotations (12.64 v. 6.30 cases, p < 0.01). Most cases occurred after hours while residents were on call rather than during daytime ACS hours (78.8% v. 21.1%, p < 0.01). Senior residents were more likely than junior residents to report having a primary operator role (71.3% v. 32.0%, p < 0.01). Although the timing of cases made no difference in the operative role of senior residents, junior residents assumed the primary operator role more often during the daytime than after hours (50.0% v. 33.1%, p = 0.01). Despite implementation of the ACS model, residents in our program obtained most of their EGS operative experience after hours while on call. Although further research is needed, our study suggests that improved daytime access to the operating room may represent an opportunity to improve the quantity and quality of the EGS operative experience at our academic network. Il a été prouvé que le modèle de chirurgie en soins actifs (CSA) améliore les résultats pour le patient, l’hôpital et le chirurgien. Pour le moment, peu de publications s’intéressent aux effets de ce modèle sur les résidents. Notre étude compare l’expérience des chirurgies générales d’urgence (CGU) chez les résidents effectuant un stage en CSA et chez les résidents effectuant un stage optionnel en chirurgie. Les cas de CGU rapportés par les résidents ont été recueillis de manière prospective pendant 9 mois dans 3 hôpitaux universitaires. Les statistiques descriptives ont été compilées, et les 2 groupes ont été comparés à l’aide du test du χ2 pour les variables catégorielles et du test t pour les variables continues. En tout, 1061 cas ont été rapportés (la participation des résidents était de plus de 90 %). Les atteintes de l’appendice et de la vésicule biliaire représentaient 49,7 % des CGU. Les résidents en CSA ont indiqué participer à 2 fois plus de CGU que les résidents en stage optionnel (12,64 c. 6,30 cas, p < 0,01). La plupart des CGU se sont produites en dehors des heures normales, alors que les résidents étaient de garde, plutôt que pendant les heures de CSA (78,8 % c. 21,1 %, p < 0,01). Les médecins résidents finissants étaient plus susceptibles d'indiquer avoir tenu le rôle de chirurgien principal que les résidents en début de parcours (71,3 % c. 32,0 %, p < 0,01). Le moment des chirurgies ne faisait aucune différence pour ce qui est du rôle des résidents finissants, mais les résidents en début de parcours ont davantage assumé le rôle de chirurgien principal pendant les heures de CSA que pendant les périodes de garde (50,0 % c. 33,1 %, p < 0,01). Malgré l’adoption du modèle de CSA, les résidents de notre programme ont acquis la majorité de leur expérience en CGU en dehors des heures normales, alors qu’ils étaient de garde. Bien que d’autres études soient nécessaires, notre étude laisse croire qu’un meilleur accès aux salles d’opération pendant le jour pourrait augmenter la quantité et la qualité de l’expérience en CGU dans le réseau universitaire."

    "abstract": "To investigate whether any specific acute care surgery patient populations are associated with a higher incidence of COVID-19 infection. Acute care providers may be exposed to an increased risk of contracting the COVID-19 infection since many patients present to the emergency department without complete screening measures. However, it is not known which patients present with the highest incidence. All acute care surgery (ACS) patients who presented to our level I trauma center between March 19, 2020, and September 20, 2020 and were tested for COVID-19 were included in the study. The patients were divided into two cohorts: COVID positive (+) and COVID negative (-). Patient demographics, type of consultation (emergency general surgery consults [EGS], interpersonal violence trauma consults [IPV], and non-interpersonal violence trauma consults [NIPV]), clinical data and outcomes were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to compare differences between the groups. In total, 2177 patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 116 were COVID+ (5.3%) and 2061 were COVID- (94.7%). COVID+ patients were more frequently Latinos (64.7% versus 61.7%, P = 0.043) and African Americans (18.1% versus 11.2%, P < 0.001) and less frequently Caucasian (6.0% versus 14.1%, P < 0.001). Asian/Filipino/Pacific Islander (7.8% versus 7.2%, P = 0.059) and Native American/Other/Unknown (3.4% versus 5.8%, P = 0.078) groups showed no statistical difference in COVID incidence. Mortality, hospital and ICU lengths of stay were similar between the groups and across patient populations stratified by the type of consultation. Logistic regression demonstrated higher odds of COVID+ infection amongst IPV patients (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.62-7.56, P < 0.001) compared to other ACS consultation types. Our findings demonstrate that victims of interpersonal violence were more likely positive for COVID-19, while in hospital outcomes were similar between COVID-19 positive and negative patients."

    "abstract": "The U.S. population is aging and projected to undergo an increasing number of general surgical procedures. However, recent trends in the frequency of major abdominal procedures in older adults are currently unknown as improvements in non-operative interventions may obviate the need for major surgery. Thus, we evaluated the trends of major abdominal surgical procedures in older adults in the United States. We performed a retrospective cohort study using the National Inpatient Sample from 2002 to 2014 with trend analysis using National Cancer Institute's Joinpoint Trend Analysis Software. We identified the average annual percent change (AAPC) in the yearly frequency of major abdominal surgical procedures in older adults (≥50 years of age). Our cohort included a total of 3,951,947 survey-weighted discharges that included a major abdominal surgery in adults ≥50 years of age between 2002 and 2014. Of these discharges, 2,529,507 (64.0%) were for elective abdominal surgeries, 2,062,835 (52.0%) were for female patients, and mean (SD) age was 61.4 (15.9) years. The frequency of major abdominal procedures (elective and emergent) decreased for adults aged 65-74 (AAPC: -1.43, -1.75, -1.11, p < 0.0001), 75-84 (AAPC: -2.75, -3.33, -2.16, p < 0.001), and ≥85 (AAPC: -4.07, -4.67, -3.47, p < 0.0001). The AAPC for elective procedures decreased for older adults aged 75-84 (AAPC = -1.65; -2.44, -0.85: p = 0.0001) and >85 (AAPC = -3.53; -4.57, -2.48: p < 0.0001). All age groups showed decreases in emergent procedures in 50-64 (AAPC = -1.76, -2.00, -1.52, p < 0.0001), 65-74 (AAPC = -3.59, -4.03, -3.14, p < 0.0001), 75-84 (AAPC = -3.90, -4.34, -3.46, p < 0.0001), ≥85 (AAPC = -4.58, -4.98, -4.17, p < 0.0001) age groups. In this cohort of older adults, the frequency of emergent and elective major abdominal procedures in adults ≥65 years of age decreased with significant variation among individual procedure types. Future studies are needed to identify the generalizability of our findings to other surgical procedures."

    "abstract": "Changes in discharge disposition and delays in discharge negatively impact the patient and hospital system. Our objectives were1 to determine the accuracy with which trauma and emergency general surgery (TEGS) providers could predict the discharge disposition for patients and2 determine the factors associated with incorrect predictions. Discharge dispositions and barriers to discharge for 200 TEGS patients were predicted individually by members of the multidisciplinary TEGS team within 24 h of patient admission. Univariate analyses and multivariable logistic least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regressions determined the associations between patient characteristics and correct predictions. A total of 1,498 predictions of discharge disposition were made by the multidisciplinary TEGS team for 200 TEGS patients. Providers correctly predicted 74% of discharge dispositions. Prediction accuracy was not associated with clinical experience or job title. Incorrect predictions were independently associated with older age (OR 0.98; P < 0.001), trauma admission as compared to emergency general surgery (OR 0.33; P < 0.001), higher Injury Severity Scores (OR 0.96; P < 0.001), longer lengths of stay (OR 0.90; P < 0.001), frailty (OR 0.43; P = 0.001), ICU admission (OR 0.54; P < 0.001), and higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores (OR 0.94; P = 0.006). The TEGS team can accurately predict the majority of discharge dispositions. Patients with risk factors for unpredictable dispositions should be flagged to better allocate appropriate resources and more intensively plan their discharges."

This study compares reimbursement rates for surgical procedures performed by emergency general surgery (EGS) services at the University of Kentucky (UK) before and after Medicaid expansion in January 2014. This IRB-approved, single-institution study retrospectively evaluated all patients undergoing surgical treatment by our EGS team from 1/1/2011 to 12/31/2016. We queried operative records for the most frequently performed procedures by the EGS service. We reviewed patient electronic medical records and hospital financial records to identify insurance status, diagnosis codes, and expected hospital reimbursements, based on UK Hospital's procedure/payer accounting models. Four thousand six hundred ninety-three patient procedures met inclusion criteria; 46.5% of these came before ACA expansion and 53.5% after expansion. The most frequent procedures performed were incision and drainage, laparoscopic appendectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and exploratory laparotomy. After ACA expansion, the proportion of patients with Medicaid nearly doubled (19.8% vs. 35.6%, p < 0.001). Concomitantly, there was a more than fivefold decrease in the uninsured patient population after expansion (23.3% vs. 4.6%, p < 0.001), and mean hospital reimbursement increased for laparoscopic appendectomy (13.7%, p < 0.001), laparoscopic cholecystectomy (50.7%, p < 0.001), and incision and drainage (70.2%, p < 0.001). After ACA expansion, there was a sustained decrease in proportion of uninsured patients and a concomitant sustained increase in proportion of patients with access to Medicaid services in the EGS operative population, leading to increased mean hospital reimbursements and decreased patient financial burden."

Socioeconomic factors have not been extensively studied in surgical management of SBO. We queried the 2016 NRD database for all surgically managed admissions ≥18 years of age with a primary diagnosis of SBO. The primary outcomes for this analysis were index admission mortality, 30-day mortality, and 30-day readmissions. Multivariate logistic regression models were utilized to examine the association between predictors and primary outcomes. Medicaid patients had a higher likelihood of index admission mortality. Medicare and Medicaid patients both had higher likelihoods of 30-day readmissions.results CONCLUSIONS: Careful consideration should be taken before deciding the optimal surgical approach in patients with SBO. Medicaid beneficiaries and those with existing comorbidities should receive careful post-operative follow-up to ensure optimal outcomes."

We sought to study the impact of body mass index (BMI) on the clinical outcomes of the high-risk emergency general surgery (EGS) elderly patients. All EGS ≥65 years old patients in the 2007-2016 ACS-NSQIP database, identified using the variables 'emergency' and 'surgspec,' were included. Patients were classified into five groups: normal weight: BMI <25 kg/m2, overweight: BMI ≥25 kg/m2 and <30 kg/m2, Class I: BMI ≥30 kg/m2 and <35 kg/m2, Class II: BMI ≥35 kg/m2 and <40 kg/m2, and Class III: BMI ≥40 kg/m2. Patients with BMI<18.5 kg/m2 were excluded. Multivariable logistic regression models were built to assess the relationship between obesity and 30-day postoperative mortality, overall morbidity, and individual postoperative complications after adjusting for demographics (e.g., age, gender), comorbidities (e.g., diabetes mellitus, heart failure), laboratory tests (e.g., white blood cell count, albumin), and operative complexity (e.g., ASA classification). A total of 78,704 patients were included, of which 26,011 were overweight (33.1%), 13,897 (17.6%) had Class I obesity, 5904 (7.5%) had Class II obesity, and 4490 (5.7%) had Class III obesity. On multivariable analyses, compared to the nonobese, patients who are overweight or with Class I-III obesity paradoxically had a lower risk of mortality, bleeding requiring transfusion, pneumonia, stroke and myocardial infarction (MI). Additionally, the incidence of MI and stroke decreased in a stepwise fashion as BMI progressed from overweight to severely obese (MI: OR: 0.84 [0.73-0.95], OR: 0.73 [0.62-0.86], OR: 0.66 [0.52-0.83], OR: 0.51 [0.38-0.68]; stroke: OR: 0.80 [0.65-0.99], OR: 0.79 [0.62-1.02], OR: 0.71 [0.50-1.00], OR: 0.43 [0.28-0.68]). In our study of elderly EGS patients, overweight and obese patients had a lower risk of mortality, bleeding requiring transfusion, pneumonia, reintubation, stroke, and MI. Further studies are needed to confirm and investigate the obesity paradox in this patient population."

    "abstract": "To evaluate and analyze the impact of lockdown strategy due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on emergency general surgery (EGS) in the Milan area at the beginning of pandemic outbreak. A survey was distributed to 14 different hospitals of the Milan area to analyze the variation of EGS procedures. Each hospital reported the number of EGS procedures in the same time frame comparing 2019 and 2020. The survey revealed that the number of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in 2020 was reduced by 19% when compared with 2019. The decrease was statistically significant only for abdominal wall surgery. Interestingly, in 2020, there was an increase of three procedures: surgical intervention for acute mesenteric ischemia (p = 0.002), drainage of perianal abscesses (p = 0.000285), and cholecystostomy for acute cholecystitis (p = 0.08). During the first COVID-19 pandemic wave in the metropolitan area of Milan, the number of patients operated for emergency diseases decreased by around 19%. We believe that this decrease is related either to the fear of the population to ask for emergency department (ED) consultation and to a shift towards a more non-operative management in the surgeons 'decision making' process. The increase of acute mesenteric ischaemia and perianal abscess might be related to the modification of dietary habits and reduction of physical activity related to the lockdown."

The current management of acute appendicitis is increasingly controversial as non-operative management gains favor. Although rare, appendiceal neoplasms are often found as an incidental finding in the setting of appendectomy. Criteria and screening for appendiceal neoplasms are not standardized among surgical societies. The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database was queried for all patients who underwent appendectomy over a 9-year period (2010-2018). Over the same time period, patients who underwent appendectomy in two municipal hospitals in The Bronx, New York City, USA were reviewed. We found a 1.7% incidence of appendiceal neoplasms locally and a 0.53% incidence of appendiceal tumors in a national population sample. Both groups demonstrated an increased incidence of appendiceal carcinoma by age. This finding was most pronounced after the age of 40 in both local and national populations. In our study, the incidence of appendiceal tumors increased with each decade interval up to the age of 80 and peaked at 2.1% in patients between 70 and 79 years. Appendiceal adenocarcinomas were identified in patients with acute appendicitis that seem to be associated with increasing age. The presence of an appendiceal malignancy should be considered in the management of older patients with acute appendicitis before a decision to embark on non-operative therapy."

The effect of SARS-CoV-2 on hospital and health care delivery systems has been widely reported. Elective surgical procedures were suspended; however, trauma and acute care services remained active and faced unique challenges during this pandemic. Trauma patients by their nature of injury require rapid assessment and treatment to include invasive emergency operations. Not only do trauma centers have to adapt to limited resources and new procedures limiting exposure, they are also met with the confounding issue of trauma patients concomitantly presenting with SARS-CoV-2 respiratory illness. Trauma care providers must now contend with SARS-CoV-2 on the differential for patients presenting with trauma. This is demonstrated by our case of two brothers with identical mechanisms of injury presenting simultaneously, one in shock from respiratory failure and the other hemorrhagic."

The aim of this study was to analyse causes of death and their relationship to discharge diagnoses, in patients who died within 1 year of discharge from an EGS service in Scotland. This was a population cohort study of all patients with an EGS admission in Scotland, UK, in the year before death. Patients admitted to EGS services between January 2008 and December 2017 were included. Data regarding patient admissions were obtained from the Information Services Division in Scotland, and cross-referenced to death certificate data, obtained from the National Records of Scotland. Of 507 308 patients admitted to EGS services, 7917 died while in hospital, and 52 094 within 1 year of discharge. For the latter, the median survival time was 67 (i.q.r. 21-168) days after EGS discharge. Malignancy accounted for 48 per cent of deaths and was the predominant cause of death in patients aged over 35 years. The cause of death was directly related to the discharge diagnosis in 56.5 per cent of patients. Symptom-based discharge diagnoses were often associated with a malignancy not diagnosed on admission. When analysed by subsequent cause of death, EGS is a cancer-based specialty. Adequate follow-up and close links with oncology and palliative care services merit development."

We evaluated trends in independent operating (defined as a resident operating alone, without attending having scrubbed) over the study period. Other outcomes of interest: operative time, 30-day-mortality and complications. The ACS-NSQIP database. Patients undergoing one of 7 emergency general surgery operations. Data regarding resident involvement was only available for the years 2005-2010. 90,790 operations were performed, 922 (1%) by residents operating independently. Appendectomy accounted for 61% independent cases. Independent resident operating was associated with a longer operative time (65 versus 58 minutes, p < 0.001), but lower risk of bleeding requiring transfusion (p < 0.001) and progressive renal insufficiency (p = 0.02). Independent operating was not associated with increased risk of complications/mortality. Independent resident operating is rare, even with increasing attention to its importance, and is not associated with increased complications or mortality. National data on this subject is old and not currently collected. There is need for a national registry on resident involvement to understand the current effect of independent operating on outcomes."

    "abstract": "We analyzed the use of Extracorporeal Membranous Oxygenation (ECMO) in acute care surgery patients at our Level-1 trauma center. We hypothesized that this patient population has improved ECMO outcomes. This was a retrospective analysis of emergency general surgery and trauma patients placed on ECMO between the periods of October 2013 and February 2020. There were 10 surgical and 12 trauma patients studied, who eventually required ECMO support. ECMO support and ECMO type/modality were analyzed with injury and survival prognostic scores examined. Overall, 16 of the 22 patients survived to hospital discharge, for a survival rate of 73%. Mean age was 34.18 years. Mean hospital length of stay was 23.4 days with mean days on ECMO equal to 7.5. The net negative fluid balance was 5.36 L. The survival of our ECMO cohort is notably higher than previously cited studies. Our group demonstrated decreased length of time on ECMO, decreased length of stay in the hospital, and similar rates of complications compared to prior reports. ECMO is a useful modality in acute care surgical patients and should be considered in these patient populations. Our focus on net negative fluid balance for ECMO patients demonstrates improved survival. ECMO should be considered early in surgical patients and early in advanced trauma life support."

Incarceration status has been associated with disproportionate rates of cancer and infectious diseases. However, little is known about the burden emergency general surgery (EGS) in criminal justice involved (CJI) populations. The California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) database was used to evaluate all hospital admissions with common EGS diagnoses in CJI persons from 2012-2014. The population of CJI individuals in California was determined using United States Bureau of Justice Statistics data. Primary outcomes were rates of admission and procedures for five common EGS diagnoses, while the secondary outcome was probability of complex presentation. A total of 4,345 admissions for CJI patients with EGS diagnoses were identified. The largest percentage of EGS admissions were with peptic ulcer disease (41.0%), followed by gallbladder disease (27.5%), small bowel obstruction (14.0%), appendicitis (13.8%), and diverticulitis (10.5%). CJI patients had variable probabilities of receipt of surgery depending on condition, ranging from 6.2% to 90.7%. 5.6% to 21.0% of admissions presented with complicated disease, the highest being with peptic ulcer disease and appendicitis. Admissions with EGS diagnoses were common and comparable to previously published rates of disease in general population. CJI individuals had high rates of complicated presentation, but low rates of surgical intervention. More granular evaluation of the burden and management of these common, morbid, and costly surgical diagnoses is essential for ensuring timely and quality care delivery for this vulnerable population."

Secondary analysis was performed analyzing disease severity, morbidity, and mortality. From March 1st to May 31st, 2020, 2.5 emergency general surgery operations were performed on average daily compared to 3.0 operations on average daily in 2019, a significant decrease (P = .03). No significant difference was found in presenting disease severity, morbidity, or mortality between the pandemic and control groups. This study demonstrates a decrease of 65% in emergency general surgery operations during governmental restrictions secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic. This decrease in operations was not associated with worse disease severity, morbidity, or mortality."

    "abstract": "Several trauma studies have shown that a \"flat\" inferior vena cava (IVC) is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including hypovolemic shock, major bleeding, transfusions and mortality. These studies utilize IVC measurements on computed tomography (CT) scans, and rarely include emergency general surgery patients. We examine the association between IVC flatness and clinical outcomes in a series of patients with perforated viscus. Medical records at an academic hospital were reviewed of adults with perforated viscus. Patients who underwent laparotomy or laparoscopy were included if they underwent CT within 12 h prior to incision time. Perforated appendicitis was excluded. A ratio was calculated of the transverse to anterior-posterior diameter of the IVC at 3 locations, then averaged. Clinical outcomes were analyzed by the average IVC ratio. A total of 83 patients were included. Using binomial regression, the average IVC ratio significantly correlated with ICU admission (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.2 to 11) and acute kidney injury (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.0 to 5.3), but not postoperative shock (OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.56 to 2.6). A flat IVC on CT prior to an operation for perforated viscus was associated with worse outcomes, including increased rate of ICU admission and acute kidney injury. More outcomes research is needed to assess the potential role of IVC assessment in preoperative resuscitation."

All hemodynamically non-compromised abdominal trauma patients who underwent splenectomy from 1/2013 to 12/2017 at our Level 1 trauma center were included. Demographic and clinical data were collected and analysed with per-protocol and an intention-to-treat comparison between open vs laparoscopic groups. 49 splenectomies were performed (16 laparoscopic, 33 open). Among the laparoscopic group, 81% were successfully completed laparoscopically. Laparoscopy was associated with a higher incidence of concomitant surgical procedures (p 0.016), longer operative times, but a significantly faster return of bowel function and oral diet without reoperations. No significant differences were demonstrated in morbidity, mortality, length of stay, or long-term complications, although laparoscopic had lower surgical site infection (0 vs 21%).The isolated splenic injury sub-analysis included 25 splenectomies,76% (19) open and 24% (6) laparoscopic and confirmed reduction in post-operative morbidity (40 vs 57%), blood transfusion (0 vs 48%), ICU admission (20 vs 57%) and overall LOS (7 vs 9 days) in the laparoscopic group. Laparoscopic splenectomy is a safe and effective technique for hemodynamically stable patients with splenic trauma and may represent an advantageous alternative to open splenectomy in terms of post-operative recovery and morbidity."

This study compared the outcomes and characteristics of the ACS system and traditional on-call system (TROS) for acute appendicitis in South Korea. This single-center, retrospective study included all patients (aged ≥18 years) who underwent surgery for acute appendicitis in 2016 and 2018. The TROS and ACS system were used for the 2016 and 2018 groups, respectively. We retrospectively obtained data on each patient from the electrical medical records. The independent samples t-test and Mann-Whitney U-test were used for continuous and nonnormally distributed data, respectively. In total, 126 patients were included. The time taken to get from the emergency room admission to the operating room, operation times, and postoperative complication rates were similar between both groups. However, the length of the hospital stay was shorter in the ACS group than in the TROS group (4.3 ± 3.2 days vs. 7.2 ± 9.6 days, p=0.039). Since the introduction of the ACS system, the length of hospital stay for surgical patients has decreased. This may be due to the application of an integrated medical procedure, such as a new clinical pathway, rather than differences in the surgical techniques."

For many patients, parenteral nutrition (PN) is the only feeding option available. The present study assessed the timing and outcomes of this decision-making process. A sample of at least 10 consecutive adult patients admitted as a general surgical emergency to eight UK hospitals over 1 year who had received PN was identified. Patient demographics, basic descriptors and nutritional data were captured. Process measures regarding dates decisions were made or activities completed were extracted from records, as were outcome measures including PN complications. Six time frames examining the process of PN delivery were analysed. Associations between categorical and binary variables were investigated with a chi-squared test with significance determined as p < 0.05. In total, 125 patients were included. Intestinal obstruction was the most common diagnosis with 59% of all patients deemed high risk on nutritional assessment at admission. Median time to decision for PN was 5 days following admission (n = 122, interquartile range = 7). Patients received PN for a mean of 11 days. Eighty-five percent of patients developed a complication, with a phosphate abnormality being the most commonly reported (54%). Only altered blood glucose levels appeared to correlate with a delay in starting PN (p < 0.01). The present study shows there are delays in the decision to use PN in the acutely ill surgical patient. Once initiated, the pathway is relatively short. There are high rates of electrolyte abnormalities in this population."

The declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic may have resulted in treatment delays and corresponding increases in severity of disease. This study compared cholecystitis admissions and disease severity pre- and postdeclaration of pandemic. Retrospective review of adult acute cholecystitis admissions (January 1,2020-May 31, 2020). Corresponding time periods in 2018 and 2019 comprised the historical control. Difference-in-differences analysis compared biweekly cholecystitis admissions pre- and postdeclaration in 2020 to the historical control. Odds of increased severity of disease presentation were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Cholecystitis admissions decreased 48.7% from 5.2 to 2.67 cases (RR 0.51 [0.28,0.96], P = 0.04) following pandemic declaration when comparing 2020 to historical control (P = 0.02). After stratifying by severity, only Tokyo I admissions declined significantly postdeclaration (RR 0.42 [0.18,0.97]), when compared to historical control (P = 0.02). There was no change in odds of presenting with severe disease after the pandemic declaration (aOR 1.00 [95% CI 0.30, 3.38] P < 0.99) despite significantly longer lengths of symptoms reported in mild cases. Postpandemic declaration we experienced a significant decrease in cholecystitis admissions without corresponding increases in disease severity. The pandemic impacted healthcare-seeking behaviors, with fewer mild presentations. Given that the pandemic did not increase odds of presenting with increased severity of disease, our data suggests that not all mild cases of cholecystitis progress to worsening disease and some may resolve without medical or surgical intervention."

Developing metrics to accurately quantify spatial access to care is critical for this field. We sought to evaluate the ability of the spatial access ratio (SPAR), which incorporates travel time, hospital capacity, and population demand in its ability to measure spatial access to EGS care and delineate disparities. We constructed a geographic information science platform for EGS-capable hospitals in California and mapped population location, race, and socioeconomic characteristics. We compared the SPAR to the shortest travel time model in its ability to identify disparities in spatial access overall and for vulnerable populations. Reduced spatial access was defined as >60 minutes travel time or lowest three classes of SPAR. A total of 283 EGS-capable hospitals were identified, of which 142 (50%) had advanced resources. Using shortest travel time, only 166,950 persons (0.4% of total population) experienced prolonged (>60 minutes) travel time to any EGS-capable hospital, which increased to 1.05 million (2.7%) for advanced-resource centers. Using SPAR, 11.5 million (29.5%) had reduced spatial access to any EGS hospital, and 13.9 million (35.7%) for advanced-resource centers. Rural residents had significantly decreased access for both overall and advanced EGS services when assessed by SPAR despite travel times within the 60-minute threshold. While travel time and SPAR showed similar overall geographic patterns of spatial access to EGS hospitals, SPAR identified a greater a greater proportion of the population as having limited access to care. Nearly one third of California residents experience reduced spatial access to EGS hospitals when assessed by SPAR. Metrics that incorporate measures of population demand and hospital capacity in addition to travel time may be useful when assessing spatial access to surgical services.

In-room-to-surgery-start time was significantly faster in the robotic group than the laparoscopic group (25 versus 31 min, p = 0.01). Complication rate, complication severity, operating time, hospital length of stay, postoperative vasopressor requirement, discharge to home, hospital length of stay and 30-day readmission were all improved in the robotic group, although these were not statistically significant. Both total inpatient and procedural costs were more in the robotic group than the laparoscopic group.

The aim of this study was to assess the experience and autonomy of general surgery trainees in New Zealand in 10 emergency general surgery procedures, and identify factors associated with reaching primary operator (PO) thresholds. Operative logbook data from all New Zealand general surgery trainees from 2013 to 2017 were analysed. Data for 10 emergency general surgery procedures were extracted to determine PO and autonomous PO (mentor not scrubbed) rates. A threshold of 70% for PO and APO rates was used to define two levels of proficiency. A total of 120 trainees performed 40 865 included procedures. Trainees met the PO threshold for all procedures by Surgical Education and Training (SET) 5. The APO threshold was met for three of 10 procedures (appendicectomy, drainage of perianal abscess and perforated peptic ulcer repair). Final APO rates for the other procedures ranged from 18% to 58%. On multivariate analysis, SET year and case volume were associated with increased odds of meeting the PO and APO thresholds. Female trainees were less likely to reach the PO and APO thresholds for three of 10 and four of 10 procedures, respectively. Trainees had increasing PO and autonomous PO rates over the course of their training. Graduating New Zealand general surgeons likely have sufficient operative experience in emergency general surgery procedures. However, rates of autonomy are lower, and further research is needed to determine whether this affects readiness for independent practice."

(2) Implement an operation note proforma to improve adherence. (3) Re-audit to assess effectiveness of operation note proforma. A retrospective audit was performed measuring compliance of laparoscopic appendicectomy notes to RCSEng criteria over a 4-month period at a central London tertiary care centre. A laparoscopic appendicectomy operation note proforma was designed and implemented. Compliance to RCSEng criteria was then re-audited against RCSEng criteria, and statistical analysis performed to assess the significance of changes to compliance. The average compliance with the RCSEng guidelines after the first cycle retrospectively was 56.1%. The average compliance after implementation of the proforma was 98.2%, with above 80% of operation notes satisfying all RSCEng criteria. This was a significant 42.1% (p < 0.0001) increase in average compliance. The implementation of the proforma reduced the amount of hand-written information, saving time and improving legibility of the operation notes. The implementation of an operation note proforma has the ability to significantly improve operation note quality. This simple and effective intervention to improve operation note quality has the potential to improve post-operative safety and continuity of care post laparoscopic appendicectomy."

We sought to define sensitivity/specificity of transaminases in identifying choledocholithiasis and to incorporate them into a biochemical marker composite score that could accurately predict choledocholithiasis. All adult patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy by our Emergency Surgery Service between 2010 and 2018 were reviewed. Admission total bilirubin (TB), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was captured. Choledocholithiasis was confirmed via intraoperative cholangiogram, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. Area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) or C-statistic for AST, ALT, ALP, and TB as a measure of detecting choledocholithiasis was calculated. For score development, our database was randomly dichotomized to derivation and validation cohort and a score was derived. The score was validated by calculating its C-statistic. 1089 patients were included; 210 (20.3%) had confirmed choledocholithiasis. The AUC was .78 for TB, .77 for ALP and AST, and .76 for ALT. 545 and 544 patients were included in the derivation and the validation cohort, respectively. The elements of the derived score were TB, AST, and ALP. The score ranged from 0 to 4. The AUC was .82 in the derivation and .77 in the validation cohort. The probability of choledocholithiasis increased from 8% to 89% at scores 0 to 4, respectively. Aspartate aminotransferase predicted choledocholithiasis adequately and should be featured in choledocholithiasis screening algorithms. We developed a biochemical composite score, shown to be accurate in preoperative choledocholithiasis risk assessment in an emergency surgery setting."

As a subgroup analysis, the performance of POTTER in predicting the outcomes of patients undergoing emergency laparotomy was assessed. A total of 59,955 patients were included. Median age was 50 years and 51.3% were women. POTTER predicted mortality (c-statistic = 0.93) and morbidity (c-statistic = 0.83) extremely well. Among individual complications, POTTER had the highest performance in predicting septic shock (c-statistic = 0.93), respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation for 48 hours or longer (c-statistic = 0.92), and acute renal failure (c-statistic = 0.92). Among patients undergoing emergency laparotomy, the c-statistic performances of POTTER in predicting mortality and morbidity were 0.86 and 0.77, respectively. POTTER is an interpretable, accurate, and user-friendly predictor of 30-day outcomes in patients undergoing EGS. POTTER could prove useful for bedside counseling of patients and their families and for benchmarking of EGS care."

Of 772 included patients, 469 (60.8%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 50.1 (20.0) years. Of 772 operations, 618 were by surgeons with less than 10 years of experience. Early- and late-midcareer surgeons generally operated on older patients and patients with more septic shock, acute kidney failure, and higher Emergency Surgery Scores. Patient mortality, complications, postoperative transfusion, organ-space surgical site infection, and length of stay were similar between surgeon groups. Patients operated on by early-career surgeons had higher rates of unplanned return to the operating room compared with those operated on by early-midcareer surgeons (odds ratio [OR], 0.66; 95% CI, 0.40-1.09), late-midcareer surgeons (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.13-0.90), and late-career surgeons (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.45-2.75). Patients operated on by surgeons with less than 3 years of experience had similar mortality compared with the rest of the cohort (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 0.85-4.57) but higher rates of complications (OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.05-4.07). In this study, experienced surgeons generally operated on older patients with more septic shock and kidney failure without affecting risk-adjusted mortality. Increased complications and unplanned return to the operating room may improve with experience. Early-career surgeons' outcomes may be improved if they are supported while experience is garnered."

    "abstract": "Some medical disciplines have reported a strong decrease of emergencies during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; however, the effect of the lockdown on general surgery emergencies remains unclear. This study is a retrospective, multicenter analysis of general surgery emergency operations performed during the period from 1 March to 15th 2020 lockdown and in the same time period of 2019 in three medical centers providing emergency surgical care to the area Salzburg-North, Austria. In total 165 emergency surgeries were performed in the study period of 2020 compared to 287 in 2019. This is a significant decrease of 122 (42.5%) emergency surgeries during the COVID-19 lockdown (p = 0.005). The length of hospital stay was reduced to 3 days in 2020 compared to 4 in 2019. Appendectomy remained the most performed emergency surgery for both periods; however the number of surgeries was reduced to less than a half, with 72 cases in 2019 and 33 cases in 2020 (p = 0.118). Emergency colon surgery observed the strongest decrease of 75% from 17 cases in 2019 to 4 in 2020. In addition, the emergency abdominal wall hernia, cholecystectomies for acute cholecystitis, small surgeries and proctological emergencies recorded drops of 70%, 39%, 33% and 47% respectively. The strongest reduction in frequencies of emergency surgeries was reported from the designated COVID center in the examined region. Emergency general surgery is an essential service that continues to run under all circumstances. Our data show that COVID-19-related restrictions have resulted in a significant decrease in the utilization of acute surgical care."

    "title": "Pain Interference and Decreased Physical Function After Emergency General Surgery: Measuring Patient-Reported Outcomes.",
    "abstract": "There is increasing emphasis on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) measures in healthcare, but this area remains largely unexplored in emergency general surgery (EGS) conditions. We hypothesized that postoperative patients in our EGS clinic would report detrimental changes in several domains of health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We administered the PROMIS-29, a HRQoL measurement tool, to postoperative patients in our EGS clinic (11/2019-4/2020). Patients responded to measures of 7 domains. Domain scores were converted to t-scores, allowing comparison to average values within the general US population (set to 50 by definition). We report the mean scores within each domain. Higher scores in negatively worded domains (e.g., \"Depression\") are worse; vice versa for positively worded domains (e.g., \"Physical Function\"). Changes in scores at subsequent clinic visits were analyzed using the paired t-test. There were 97 patients who completed the PROMIS-29 at the first postoperative visit. Mean (SD) age was 54.1 (16.2) years; 51% were male. There was no difference in our patients from the average US population in the domains of Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities, Anxiety, Fatigue, and Sleep Disturbance. However, EGS patients experienced significantly greater Pain Interference (56.1 [54.1, 58.1]) and worse Physical Function (40.6 [38.4, 42.7]) than average. For patients seen in follow-up twice (13 patients, median interval between clinic visits 21 days), there were improvements in the domains of Physical Function (42.9 vs 37.3; p = 0.04) and Fatigue. We demonstrate room for improvement in the domains of pain interference and physical function. While positive changes over a relatively short period of time are encouraging, consideration should be given to patient perceptions of illness and lifestyle impact when managing EGS patients."

The patients who over 60 year-old have numerous factors associated with high mortality and morbidity in emergency colorectal surgery. We aimed to identify potentially preventable risk factors, to improve patients' outcomes. A retrospective review of patients age over 60 year-old undergoing emergency colorectal surgery in the ACS service from August 1, 2017 through November 30, 2019. Ninety-two patients were analyzed, average age 72.41 years. The most common diagnosis was complicated colorectal cancer (76, 83.52%) with locations on the right (37, 41.51%), left (35,39.33%), and rectum (17, 19.10%). Clinical presentations were obstruction without perforation (61, 67.03%), perforation (25, 27.17%), and ischemia (2, 2.17%). Overall mortality was 6.52%. Cause of death included septic shock (3, 50%); respiratory failure (3, 50%); and pulmonary embolism (1, 16.67%). Morbidity from surgical and medical complications were 41.30% and 26.08%, respectively. For all causes, operations included resection with primary anastomosis (62, 71.26%); Hartmann's operation (11, 12.64%); and loop colostomy (12, 13.79%). Average operative time was 159.86 min. In emergency colorectal surgery, pre-existing heart disease, clinical perforation, and ventilator dependency increased risk of death 7.6-, 16.5-, and 0.08-fold, respectively. Clinical perforation leads to sepsis and septic shock in older patients, this may be modifiable to improve mortality by developing an early, rapid, protocol-driven surgical sepsis fast-track process. Ventilator dependency is potentially modifiable with postoperative advanced surgical critical care. The non-modifiable risk factor of co-morbid heart disease might be improved by postoperative advanced critical care for close monitoring."

    "abstract": "Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols reduce length of stay, complications and costs for a large number of elective surgical procedures. A similar, structured approach appears to improve outcomes, including mortality, for patients undergoing high-risk emergency general surgery, and specifically emergency laparotomy. These are the first consensus guidelines for optimal care of these patients using an ERAS approach. Experts in aspects of management of the high-risk and emergency general surgical patient were invited to contribute by the International ERAS® Society. Pubmed, Cochrane, Embase, and MEDLINE database searches on English language publications were performed for ERAS elements and relevant specific topics. Studies on each item were selected with particular attention to randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses and large cohort studies, and reviewed and graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Recommendations were made on the best level of evidence, or extrapolation from studies on non-emergency patients when appropriate. The Delphi method was used to validate final recommendations. The guideline has been divided into two parts: Part 1-Preoperative Care and Part 2-Intraoperative and Postoperative management. This paper provides guidelines for Part 1. Twelve components of preoperative care were considered. Consensus was reached after three rounds. These guidelines are based on the best available evidence for an ERAS approach to patients undergoing emergency laparotomy. Initial management is particularly important for patients with sepsis and physiological derangement. These guidelines should be used to improve outcomes for these high-risk patients."

    "abstract": "Emergency midline laparotomy is the cornerstone of survival in patients with peritonitis. While bundling of care elements has been shown to optimize outcomes, this has focused on elective rather than emergency abdominal surgery. The aim of this study was to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of factors affecting the development of surgical site infection (SSI) in patients undergoing midline emergency laparotomy. An ethically approved, PROSPERO registered (ID: CRD42020193246) meta-analysis and systematic review, searching PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane Library electronic databases from January 2015 to June 2020 and adhering to PRISMA guidelines was undertaken. Search headings included \"emergency surgery\", \"laparotomy\", \"surgical site infection\", \"midline incision\" and \"wound bundle\". Suitable publications were graded using Methodological Index for Non-Randomised Studies (MINORS); papers scoring ≥16/24 were included for data analysis. The primary outcome in this study was SSI rates following the use of wound bundles. Secondary outcomes consisted of the effect of the individual interventions included in the bundles and the SSI rates for superficial and deep infections. Five studies focusing on closure techniques were grouped to assess their effect on SSI. This study identified 1875 articles. A total of 58 were potentially suitable, and 11 were included after applying MINORS score. The final cohort included 2,856 patients from eight countries. Three papers came from the USA, two papers from Japan and the remainder from Denmark, England, Iran, Netherlands, Spain and Turkey. There was a 32% non-significant SSI reduction after the implementation of wound bundles (RR = 0.68; CI, 0.39-1.17; p = 0.16). In bundles used for technical closure the reduction in SSI of 15% was non-significant (RR = 0.85; CI, 0.57-1.26; p = 0.41). Analysis of an effective wound bundle was limited due to insufficient data. This study identified a significant deficit in the world literature relating to emergency laparotomy and wound outcome optimisation. Given the global burden of emergency general surgery urgent action is needed to assess bundle's ability to potentially improve outcome after emergency laparotomy."

To reveal the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality and morbidity among emergency general surgery cases. Data on patients who were admitted to the emergency department of a tertiary hospital in Samsun, Turkey, and had consultations at the general surgery clinic were analyzed retrospectively. Our study included comparative analysis on two groups of patients who received emergency general surgery consultations in our hospital: during the COVID-19 pandemic period (Group 2); and on the same dates one year previously (Group 1). There were 195 patients in Group 1 and 132 in Group 2 (P < 0.001). While 113 (58%) of the patients in Group 1 were women, only 58 (44%) were women in Group 2 (P = 0.013). Considering all types of diagnosis, there was no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.261). The rates of abscess and delayed abdominal emergency diseases were higher in Group 2: one case (0.5%) versus ten cases (8%); P < 0.001. The morbidity rate was higher in Group 2 than in Group 1: three cases (1.5%) versus nine cases (7%); P = 0.016. The COVID-19 pandemic has decreased the number of unnecessary nonemergency admissions to the emergency department, but has not delayed patients' urgent consultations. The pandemic has led surgeons to deal with more complicated cases and greater numbers of complications."

We aimed to critically appraise the methodologic reporting of EGS ACS-NSQIP studies. We searched the PubMed ACS-NSQIP bibliography for EGS studies published from 2004 to 2019. The quality of reporting of each study was assessed according to the number of criteria fulfilled with respect to the 13-item RECORD statement and the 10-item JAMA Surgery checklist. Three criteria in each checklist were not applicable and were therefore excluded. An analysis was conducted comparing studies published in high and low impact factor (IF) journals. We identified a total of 99 eligible studies. Twenty-six percent of studies were published in high IF journals, and 73% of the journals had a policy requiring adherence to reporting statements. The median number of criteria fulfilled for the RECORD statement (out of 10 items) and the JAMA Surgery checklist (out of 7 items) were both equal to 4 (interquartile range [IQR] 3, 5). Sixty-three percent of studies did not explain the methodology for data cleaning, 81% of studies did not describe the population selection process, and 55% did not discuss the implications of missing variables. There were no differences in overall scores between studies published in high and low IF journals. The methodologic reporting of EGS studies using ACS-NSQIP remains suboptimal. Future efforts should focus on improving adherence to the policies to mitigate potential sources of bias and improve the credibility of large database studies."

    "abstract": "Recent consensus guidelines suggest that the laparoscopic approach may be a useful, safe and feasible approach in emergency general surgery. Despite this, the UK National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA) suggests the rate of laparoscopy is low (9% fully laparoscopic) and slow to increase over time. A European survey found uptake to be variable. This UK survey was therefore undertaken to establish current UK practice and to determine factors affecting implementation. A questionnaire survey of currently practising UK consultant general surgeons was carried out by the North West Surgical Research Collaborative, using a secure web-based database maintained by the North West Surgical Trials Centre. A total of 151 completed questionnaires were returned from 22 UK centres; 18% of respondents were unaware that laparoscopic cases should be reported to NELA. Appendicectomy (97%) and cholecystectomy (87%) were routinely performed laparoscopically. Laparoscopy was infrequently used in perforation, ischaemia or obstructed hernias. There appears to be equipoise regarding laparoscopic compared with open surgery in small-bowel obstruction among all subspecialty emergency general surgeons, in perforated peptic ulcer among upper gastrointestinal surgeons and in Hinchey III diverticulitis among colorectal surgeons. Uptake of laparoscopy in UK emergency general surgery is influenced by surgeon preference, subspecialty, patient and operative factors. Further research into outcomes may help to identify areas of greatest potential benefit. The rate of laparoscopy reported by NELA may be an underestimate due to the 18% of surgeons unaware that laparoscopic cases should be reported, which may affect the validity of analyses performed from this dataset."

The spectrum and outcome of surgical emergencies in a low-middle-income country may differ from that in high-income countries. This study aims to describe the spectrum and outcome of emergency laparotomy for nontrauma surgical emergencies at a single-tertiary center in South Africa. A retrospective interrogation of a hybrid electronic record system of consecutive patients undergoing emergency laparotomy for nontraumatic surgical emergencies presenting to Greys Hospital from December 2012 to December 2018. One thousand four hundred sixty four patients were included with a median age of 34 y (IQR 23-52) and male predominance (861; 59%). The mortality rate was 12.5% (183). The most common comorbidity was human immunodeficiency virus (353; 24.1%) which did not influence mortality. At least one comorbidity increased the odds of mortality by 4 times (95% CI 2.7-6.2). Mortality was associated with longer waiting times to operation (12.8 versus 8.4 h; P < 0.001) and longer operating times (105 min versus 80 min respectively; P < 0.001). Temporary abdominal closure was used in 245 (16.7%) patients. Planned repeat laparotomy was performed in 193 (13.2%) patients. Acute appendicitis (594, 40.6%) was the most common pathology of which 61.4% had the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma grade of 4 or more (high grade). This was followed by perforated peptic ulcer disease (10.5%). The adverse event rate was 51.5% (754). Postoperative pulmonary complications and acute kidney injury were the most common. The strongest predictors of mortality were abdominal compartment syndrome (OR 26.5, 95% CI 9.36-94.13) and postoperative hemodynamic instability 17.43 (OR 17.4, 95% CI 11.80-25.98). Our spectrum of disease differs to that found in high-income countries. The morbidity and mortality rates are significant, and attention must be focused on attempts to reduce this. Various comorbidities and adverse events are associated with increased mortality."

    "abstract": "The Acute Care Surgery model has been widely adopted by hospitals across the United States, with Acute Care Surgery services managing Emergency General Surgery patients that were previously being treated by General Surgery. In this analysis, we evaluate the impact of an Acute Care Surgery service model on General Surgery at the University of Vermont Medical Center using three metrics: under-utilized time, spillover time, and a financial ratio of work Relative Value Units over clinical Full Time Equivalents. These metrics are evaluated and used to identify three-dimensional Pareto optimality of General Surgery prior to and after the October 2015 tactical allocation to the Acute Care Surgery model. Our analysis was further substantiated using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo model for Bayesian Inference. We applied multi-objective Pareto and Bayesian breakpoint analysis to three operating room metrics to assess the impact of new operating room management decisions. In the two-dimensional space of Fig. 2, panel a), the post-tactical allocation front lies closer to the origin representing more optimal solutions for productivity and under-utilized time. The post-tactical allocation front is also closer to the origin for productivity and spillover time as shown in the two-dimensional space of Fig. 2, panel b). The results of the three-dimensional multi-objective analysis of Fig. 3 illustrate that the GS post-tactical allocation Pareto-surface is contained within a much smaller volume of space than the GS pre-tactical allocation Pareto-surface. The post-tactical allocation Pareto-surface is slightly lower along the z-axis, representing lower productivity than the pre-tactical allocation surface. This methodology might contribute to the external benchmarking and monitoring of perioperative services by visualizing the operational implications following tactical decisions in operating room management."

    "abstract": "Background: Intra-abdominal infection (IAI) is a wide range of intra-abdominal disease. Management involves empirical therapy and source control. Procalcitonin (PCT) has been suggested to assist in defining individual infection status and delivering individualized therapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects on patient outcomes of an early procalcitonin (PCT) assessment (in the emergency department [ED]) in patients with IAI. Methods: This was a retrospective, mono-centric study evaluating consecutive patients admitted to the ED from 2015 to 2019 with diagnosis of IAI. According to whether there had been PCT determination in the ED, patients were divided into no ePCT determination (no-ePCT) and early PCT determination in the ED (ePCT). The primary endpoint was the intra-hospital mortality rate. Secondary endpoints were occurrence of major complications and length of hospital stay (LOS). The propensity score match (PSM) was generated using a logistic regression model on the baseline covariates considered to be potentially influencing the decision to determine PCT in the ED and confounding factors identified as significant at a preliminary statistical analysis with respect to in-hospital death. Results: A series of 3,429 patients were included. The ePCT group consisted to 768 (22.4%), whereas the no-ePCT group contained 2,661 patients (77.6%). When the PSM was matched to the two groups, no significant difference was observed. Considering patients with uncomplicated infections, the PCT determination was associated with a higher mortality rate. We found no significant differences regarding outcomes with the exception of LOS, which was slightly longer in the ePCT group. However, we observed a tendency toward a minor difference in the number of complications in the ePCT group, in particular a reduced rate of progression to sepsis. Conclusion: Early PCT determination could be irrelevant in IAIs. The PCT value may be cost-effective and possibly improve the prognosis in cIAIs. Further research is needed to understand the optimal use of PCT, including in combination with other emerging diagnostic tests."

Little is known about the impact of obesity on patient outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine the association between body mass index (BMI) >30 kg/m2 and mortality for EGS patients. We hypothesized that obese patients would have increased mortality rates. A regional integrated health system EGS registry derived from The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma EGS ICD-9 codes was analyzed from January 2013 to October 2015. Patients were stratified into BMI categories based on WHO classifications. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Longer-term mortality with linkage to the Social Security Death Index was also examined. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed. A total of 60 604 encounters were identified and 7183 (11.9%) underwent operative intervention. Patient characteristics include 53% women, mean age 58.2 ± 18.7 years, 64.2% >BMI 30 kg/m2, 30.2% with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 19% with congestive heart failure, and 31.1% with diabetes. The most common procedure was laparoscopic cholecystectomy (36.4%). Overall, 90-day mortality was 10.9%. In multivariable analysis, all classes of obesity were protective against mortality compared to normal BMI. Underweight patients had increased risk of inpatient (OR = 1.9, CI = 1.7-2.3), 30-day (OR = 1.9, CI = 1.7-2.1), 90-day (OR = 1.8, CI 1.6-2.0), 1-year (OR = 1.8, CI = 1.7-2.0), and 3-year mortality (OR = 1.7, CI = 1.6-1.9). When stratified by BMI, underweight EGS patients have the highest odds of death. Paradoxically, obesity appears protective against death, even when controlling for potentially confounding factors. Increased rates of nonoperative management in the obese population may impact these findings."

    "abstract": "Predicting length of stay (LOS) is beneficial to patients and the health service. When a prolonged LOS is predicted, it gives the opportunity for focused therapies and allocation of resources to reduce this period. In emergency general surgery (EGS) there has been limited investigation of variables that may be important predictors of LOS. This study examines social characteristics alongside measures of severity of acute illness and co-morbidities in an adult EGS population to establish their contribution to LOS. Data were collected prospectively from patients at admission including medical variables, demographics, and therapeutic requirements. The length of hospital admission was measured, and multiple regression analysis was used to identify variables which predicted the LOS. Data were collected from 105 patients. The regression model gave an R2 of 0.34, p = 0.0006. Barthal index (measure of independence in activities of daily living) was a significant predictor of LOS [logworth 1.649, p0.02243]. Housing status and Level of social support both correlated in one-way analysis with LOS. There are non-surgical variables, measurable at admission which are of significant value in predicting LOS of EGS patients. This warrants further investigation through a larger study to better quantify the contributions of these variables, and establish potential early interventions to reduce the LOS."

Outliers were centers whose 90% confidence intervals excluded 1. This was repeated in several subsets, to determine if these yielded outliers similar to the overall dataset. We identified 45,430 EGS patients. Overall, 3 high performing centers and 5 low performing centers were identified. Exclusion of appendectomies and cholecystectomies resulted in a remaining data set of 13,569 patients (29.9% of the overall data set), with 2 high performers and 5 low performers. One low performer in the limited data set was not identified in the overall set. Evaluation of 5 procedures, making up less than a third of EGS, identifies most outliers.

We sought to prospectively evaluate whether ESS can predict the need for respiratory and/or renal support (RRS) at discharge after emergent laparotomies (EL). This is a post hoc analysis of a 19-center prospective observational study. Between April 2018 and June 2019, all adult patients undergoing EL were enrolled. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were systematically collected. In this analysis, patients were excluded if they died during the index hospitalization, were discharged to hospice, or transferred to other hospitals. A composite variable, the need for RRS, was defined as the need for one or more of the following at hospital discharge: tracheostomy, ventilator dependence, or dialysis. Emergency Surgery Score was calculated for all patients, and the correlation between ESS and RRS was examined using the c-statistics method. From a total of 1,649 patients, 1,347 were included. Median age was 60 years, 49.4% were men, and 70.9% were White. The most common diagnoses were hollow viscus organ perforation (28.1%) and small bowel obstruction (24.5%); 87 patients (6.5%) had a need for RRS (4.7% tracheostomy, 2.7% dialysis, and 1.3% ventilator dependence). Emergency Surgery Score predicted the need for RRS in a stepwise fashion; for example, 0.7%, 26.2%, and 85.7% of patients required RRS at an ESS of 2, 12, and 16, respectively. The c-statistics for the need for RRS, the need for tracheostomy, ventilator dependence, or dialysis at discharge were 0.84, 0.82, 0.79, and 0.88, respectively. Emergency Surgery Score accurately predicts the need for RRS at discharge in EL patients and could be used for preoperative patient counseling and for quality of care benchmarking.

A previous study reported that emergency providers did not adequately manage patients with severe pain despite objective findings for surgical pathologies. Our study aims to investigate clinical and laboratory factors, in addition to providers' interventions, that might have been associated with oligoanalgesia in a group of ED patients with moderate and severe pains due to surgical pathologies. We conducted a retrospective study of adult patients who were transferred directly from referring EDs to the emergency general surgery (EGS) service at a quaternary academic center between January 2014 and December 2016. Patients who were intubated, did not have adequate records, or had mild pain were excluded. The primary outcome was refractory pain, which was defined as pain reduction <2 units on the 0-10 pain scale between triage and ED departure. We analyzed 200 patients, and 58 (29%) had refractory pain. Patients with refractory pain had significantly higher disease severity, serum lactate (3.4±2.0 mg/dL vs. 1.4±0.9 mg/dL, P=0.001), and less frequent pain medication administration (median [interquartile range], 3 [3-5] vs. 4 [3-7], P=0.001), when compared to patients with no refractory pain. Multivariable logistic regression showed that the number of pain medication administration (odds ratio [OR] 0.80, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.68-0.98) and ED serum lactate levels (OR 3.80, 95% CI 2.10-6.80) were significantly associated with the likelihood of refractory pain. In ED patients transferring to EGS service, elevated serum lactate levels were associated with a higher likelihood of refractory pain. Future studies investigating pain management in patients with elevated serum lactate are needed."

    "abstract": "While the short-term risks of emergency general surgery (EGS) admission among older adults have been studied, little is known about long-term functional outcomes in this population. Our objective was to evaluate the relationship between EGS admission and the probability of an older adult being alive and residing in their own home 5 years later. We also examined the extent to which specific EGS diagnoses, need for surgery, and frailty modified this relationship. We performed a population-based, retrospective cohort study of community-dwelling older adults (age, ≥65 years) admitted to hospital for one of eight EGS diagnoses (appendicitis, cholecystitis, diverticulitis, strangulated hernia, bowel obstruction, peptic ulcer disease, intestinal ischemia, or perforated viscus) between 2006 and 2018 in Ontario, Canada. Cases were matched to controls from the general population. Time spent alive and at home (measured as time to nursing home admission or death) was compared between cases and controls using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox models. A total of 90,245 older adults admitted with an EGS diagnosis were matched with controls. In the 5 years following an EGS admission, cases experienced significantly fewer months alive and at home compared with controls (mean time, 43 vs. 50 months; p < 0.001). Except for patients operated on for appendicitis and cholecystitis, all remaining patient subgroups experienced reduced time alive and at home compared with controls (p < 0.001). Cases remained at elevated risk of nursing home admission or death compared with controls for the entirety of the 5-year follow-up (hazard ratio, 1.17-5.11). Older adults who required hospitalization for an EGS diagnosis were at higher risk for death or admission to a nursing home for at least 5 years following admission compared with controls. However, most patients (57%) remained alive and living in their own home at the end of this 5-year period. Epidemiological, level III."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) patients are more socioeconomically vulnerable than elective counterparts. We hypothesized that a hospital's neighborhood disadvantage is associated with vulnerability of its EGS patients. Area deprivation index (ADI), a neighborhood-level measure of disadvantage, and key characteristics of 724 hospitals in 14 states were linked to patient-level data in State Inpatient Databases. Hospital and EGS patient characteristics were compared across hospital ADI quartiles (least disadvantaged [ADI 1-25] \"affluent,\" minimally disadvantaged [ADI 26-50] \"min-da\", moderately disadvantaged [ADI 51-75] \"mod-da\", and most disadvantaged [ADI 76-100] \"impoverished\") using chi2 tests and multivariable regression. Higher disadvantage hospitals are more often nonteaching (affluent = 38.9%, min-da = 53.5%, mod-da = 72.1%, and impoverished = 67.6%), nonaffiliated with medical schools (50%, 72.4%, 81.8%, and 78.8%), and in rural areas (3.3%, 9.2%, 31.2%, and 27.9%). EGS patients at higher disadvantage hospitals are more likely to be older (43.9%, 48.6%, 49.1%, and 46.6%), have >3 comorbidities (17.0%, 19.0%, 18.4%, and 19.3%), live in low-income areas (21.4%, 23.6%, 32.2%, and 42.5%), and experience complications (23.2%, 23.7%, 24.0%, and 25.2%). Rates of uninsurance/underinsurance were highest at affluent and impoverished hospitals (18.0, 16.4%, 17.7%, and 19.2%). Higher disadvantage hospitals serve fewer minorities (32.6%, 21.3%, 20.7%, and 24.0%), except in rural areas (2.9%, 6.7%, 6.5%, and 15.5%). In multivariable analyses, the impoverished hospital ADI quartile did not predict odds of serving as a safety-net or predominantly minority-serving hospital. Hospitals in impoverished areas disproportionately serve underserved EGS patient populations but are less likely to have robust resources for EGS care or train future EGS surgeons. These findings have implications for measures to improve equity in EGS outcomes."

    "abstract": "Patients presenting with acute abdominal pain often undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan as part of their diagnostic workup. We investigated the relationship between availability, timeliness, and interpretation of CT imaging and outcomes for life-threatening intra-abdominal diseases or \"acute abdomen,\" in older Americans. Data from a 2015 national survey of 2811 hospitals regarding emergency general surgery structures and processes (60.1% overall response, n = 1690) were linked to 2015 Medicare inpatient claims data. We identified beneficiaries aged ≥65 admitted emergently with a confirmatory acute abdomen diagnosis code and operative intervention on the same calendar date. Multivariable regression models adjusted for significant covariates determined odds of complications and mortality based on CT resources. We identified 9125 patients with acute abdomen treated at 1253 hospitals, of which 78% had ≥64-slice CT scanners and 85% had 24/7 CT technicians. Overnight CT reads were provided by in-house radiologists at 14% of hospitals and by teleradiologists at 66%. Patients were predominantly 65-74 y old (43%), white (88%), females (60%), and with ≥3 comorbidities (67%) and 8.6% died. STAT radiology reads by a board-certified radiologist rarely/never available in 2 h was associated with increased odds of systemic complication and mortality (adjusted odds ratio 2.6 [1.3-5.4] and 2.3 [1.1-4.8], respectively). Delays obtaining results are associated with adverse outcomes in older patients with acute abdomen. This may be due to delays in surgical consultation and time to source control while waiting for imaging results. Processes to ensure timely interpretation of CT scans in patients with abdominal pain may improve outcomes in high-risk patients."

The aim of our study was to assess the prevalence of low HL (LHL) and determine its impact on outcomes after emergency general surgery (EGS). We performed a (2016-2017) prospective cohort analysis of adult EGS patients. HL was assessed using the Short Assessment of HL score. LHL was defined as Short Assessment of HL score <14. Outcomes were the prevalence of LHL, compliance with medications, wound/drain care, 30-d complications, 30-d readmission, and time to resuming activities of daily living. We enrolled 900 patients. The mean age was 43 ± 11 y. Overall, 22% of the patients had LHL. LHL patients were more likely to be Hispanics (59% versus 15%, P < 0.01), uninsured (50% versus 20%, P < 0.01), have lower socioeconomic status (80% versus 40%, P < 0.02), and are less likely to have completed college (5% versus 60%, P < 0.01) compared with HL patients. On regression analysis, LHL was associated with lower medication compliance (OR: 0.81, [0.4-0.9], P = 0.02), inadequate wound/drain care (OR: 0.75, [0.5-0.8], P = 0.01), 30-d complications (OR: 1.95, [1.3-2.5], P < 0.01), and 30-d readmission (OR: 1.51, [1.2-2.6], P = 0.02). The median time of resuming activities of daily living was longer in patients with LHL than HL patients (4 d versus 7 d, P < 0.01). One in five patients undergoing EGS has LHL. LHL is associated with decreased compliance with discharge instructions, medications, and wound/drain care. Health literacy must be taken into account when discussing the postoperative plan and better instruction is needed for patients with LHL. Level III. Prognostic."

There was concern this would affect health seeking behaviour leading to delayed presentation and worse outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of these interventions on rate and severity of acute general surgical admissions in Northland, New Zealand. A retrospective comparative cohort study was performed. Two cohorts were identified: 28 February to 8 June 2020 and same period in 2019. Data for surgical admissions and operations and emergency department (ED) presentation were obtained from the hospital data warehouse. Three index diagnoses were assessed for severity. There were 650 acute general surgical admissions in 2019 and 627 in 2020 (P 0.353). Operations were performed in 226 and 224 patients respectively (P 0.829). ED presentations decreased from 11 398 to 8743 (P < 0.001). No difference in severity of acute appendicitis (P 0.970), acute diverticulitis (P 0.333) or acute pancreatitis (P 0.803) was detected.

An accurate admission note is critical as it is frequently referred to during inpatient stay, particularly when the patient is acutely unwell and during handover of care. We set out to implement a surgical admission proforma and evaluate its impact on the quality of acute surgical admission notes. A standardised, structured admission proforma for use with all emergency general surgery patients in a busy model 3 hospital was designed and implemented. Previously, all admission notes were performed freehand. The quality and completeness of admission notes was evaluated both before and after implementation of the proforma over two separate 4-week periods by assessing documentation across 19 criteria. Two hundred and fifty-one admission notes before proforma implementation and 273 admission notes after implementation were assessed. Proforma uptake was 97%. Documentation improved in all 19 criteria, with statistical significance achieved in 17 of these. These include past medical history, medication lists, allergy status, physical examination findings, blood results, vital signs and management plan. The proforma showed evidence of improved communication with both nursing staff and senior colleagues. The surgical admission proforma has significantly improved the quality and completeness of admission documentation, ensuring improved patient safety and efficiency of care. Structured admission proformas have a positive impact on patient outcomes, doctors' performance, hospital efficiency, communication and audit quality control, thus providing multiple clear benefits in comparison to freehand admission notes."

As a result, engaging special medical model will be essential to decompressing the ED visits. To do this, it will be important to understand which specific aspects to focus interventions on for the greatest impact. To characterize the emergency surgery patients who were seen and discharged from ED. Retrospective cohort study of hospitalized emergency surgery patients currently under the care from specialists presenting to an urban, university affiliated hospital between 01 January 2018 and 1 January 2019. This study will highlight some of the controversies and challenges and key lessons learned. During the study period there were 231,229 ED visits; 4100 of these patients were admitted for Acute care surgery (ACS) service. Multivariate analysis identified age ≧ 65 (p = 0.023; odds ratio, OR = 2.66), ACS model (p = 0.000, OR = 0.18), ICU stay (p = 0.000, OR = 118.73) as factors associated with in-hospital mortality. There was a increase in length of stay between young and elderly postoperative patients when stratifying patients by age (11.67 ± 9.48 vs 13.95 ± 9.11 p < 0.05). ED overcrowding is not just an ED problem. ED overcrowding is a systems problem requiring a systematic facility-wide multidisciplinary response. Continuous and high-quality surveillance data across China are needed to estimate the acute care surgery model which used to deal with ED overcrowding."

We evaluated a population of severely injured trauma patients with the aim of determining objective factors associated with the need for immediate surgical intervention. All highest-activation trauma patients transported by air ambulance between 1/1/16 and 12/31/17 were enrolled retrospectively. Transfer, pediatric, isolated burn, and isolated head trauma patients were excluded. Patients who underwent emergency general surgery within 30 min of arrival without the aid of cross-sectional imaging were compared to the remainder of the cohort. Of the 863 patients who were enrolled, 85 (10%) spent less than 30 min in the emergency department (ED) before undergoing an emergency operation. The remaining 778 patients (90%) formed the comparison group. The ED ≤ 30 min group had a higher percentage of penetrating injuries, lower blood pressure, and was more likely to have a positive FAST exam. The \"Direct to Operating Room\" (DTOR) score is a predictive scoring system devised to identify patients most likely to benefit from bypassing the ED. The odds ratio of emergency operation within 30 min of hospital arrival increased by 2.71 (95% confidence interval 2.23-3.29; P < 0.001) for every 1-point increase in DTOR score. Trauma patients with profound hypotension or acidosis and positive FAST were more likely to require surgery within 30 min of hospital presentation. Use of a scoring system may allow early identification of these patients in the prehospital setting by nonphysician providers."

    "abstract": "In Australia, there has been a shift from the traditional 'on-call' surgical model to the 'acute surgical unit' (ASU) model to improve outcomes in acute general surgery. Using emergency appendicectomy as a standardized procedure, we aimed to identify the different patterns of care between these on-call structures by comparing two metropolitan district hospitals; one that employs a traditional on-call model and the other, which employ the ASU model. Data on consecutive patients undergoing emergency appendectomies at the two hospitals (traditional and ASU model) between July 2018 and December 2018 were retrieved for retrospective review. Patient factors, preoperative factors, operative factors and post-operative outcomes were collected and tabulated for comparative analysis between the traditional versus ASU model of care. Univariate analysis demonstrated that there were a greater proportion of consultant-led cases (P < 0.001), a shorter time to theatre (P = 0.047) and a greater number of out-of-hours operations (P < 0.001) in the ASU model compared to the traditional model. A larger proportion of patients from the traditional model underwent a computed tomography scan as part of their diagnostic workup compared to the ASU model (P < 0.001). There was no difference in negative appendicectomy rates, intraoperative conversion rates, post-operative complication rates or mean lengths of hospital stay between the two on-call models. The ASU and traditional on-call model appears to achieve equivalent care outcomes for patients with acute appendicitis."

A survey of French digestive surgeons was conducted to assess these changes. An electronic survey was sent to French digestive and general surgeons in the Societe Francaise de Chirurgie Digestive (SFCD) to assess the surgeons' daily activity during the pandemic and investigate changes in patients' management. The care deviations were classified as delay of management, modification of strategy, or modification of organization, and the impact of these changes on patients was evaluated by the surgeon's estimation of loss of chance. A major reduction in surgical elective activity was observed in 50 (75%) of the 67 hospitals that responded. Of these, 48 hospitals (71.6%) reported receiving SARS-CoV-2 patients. A deviation from usual care was observed in 10% of patients admitted for emergency general surgery. Among 140 patients presenting a deviation from usual care, 74 (52.9%) had delayed management, 53 (37.9%) had a modification of strategy, and 64 (45.7%) had a modification of organization. Medical treatment instead of surgical treatment was decided for 37 (26.4%) patients, resulting in a high loss of chance for 6 patients. Delays (p < 0.001) and a switch from surgical to medical treatment (p = 0.002) were independently correlated with overall loss of chance based on multivariate analysis. This study highlighted the deviations in general emergency surgery patients and provided implications for the solutions that should be implemented during a new health crisis."

    "abstract": "Nearly 4 million Americans present to hospitals with conditions requiring emergency general surgery (EGS) annually, facing significant morbidity and mortality. Unlike elective surgery and trauma, there is no dedicated national quality improvement program to improve EGS outcomes. Our objective was to estimate the number of excess deaths that could potentially be averted through EGS quality improvement in the United States. Adults with the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma-defined EGS diagnoses were identified in the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample 2006 to 2014. Hierarchical logistic regression was performed to benchmark treating hospitals into reliability adjusted mortality quintiles. Weighted generalized linear modeling was used to calculate the relative risk of mortality at each hospital quintile, relative to best-performing quintile. We then calculated the number of excess deaths at each hospital quintile versus the best-performing quintile using techniques previously used to quantify potentially preventable trauma deaths. Twenty-six million EGS patients were admitted, and 6.5 million (25%) underwent an operation. In-hospital mortality varied from 0.3% to 4.1% across the treating hospitals. Relative to the best-performing hospital quintile, an estimated 158,177 (153,509-162,736) excess EGS deaths occurred at lower-performing hospital quintiles. Overall, 47% of excess deaths occurred at the worst-performing hospitals, while 27% of all excess deaths occurred among the operative cohort. Nearly 200,000 excess EGS deaths occur across the United States each decade.

Randomized, active, controlled noninferiority trial in an urban setting, including patients from a small community hospital and a large, tertiary care hospital. Patients who underwent minimally invasive appendectomy or cholecystectomy by a group of surgeons who cover emergency general surgery at these 2 hospitals were included. Patients undergoing elective and nonelective procedures were included. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to video-based virtual visit or in-person visit. The primary outcome is the percentage of patients with 30-day hospital encounter, and we hypothesized that there would not be a significant increase in the 30-day hospital encounter proportion for patients who receive video-based virtual postdischarge care compared with patients who receive standard (in-person) care. Hospital encounter includes emergency department visit, observation, or inpatient admission. A total of 1645 patients were screened; 289 patients were randomized to the virtual group and 143 to the in-person group. Fifty-three patients crossed over to the in-person follow-up group. The percentage of patients who had a hospital encounter was noninferior for virtual visits (12.8% vs 13.3% for in-person, Δ 0.5% with 1-sided 95% CI, -∞ to 5.2%). The amount of time patients spent with the clinician (mean of 8.4 minutes virtual vs 7.8 minutes in-person; P = .30) was not different, but the median overall postoperative visit time was 27.5 minutes shorter (95% CI, -33.5 to -24.0).

Patients who underwent the following EGS procedures were identified: laparoscopic appendectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, surgery for small bowel obstruction (SBO), colectomy, and incarcerated ventral or inguinal hernia repair. The performance of the ESS in predicting mortality in each procedure was assessed using receiver operating characteristic analyses. A total of 467,803 patients underwent EGS (mean age 50 ± 19.9 y, females 241,330 [51.6%]), of which 191,930 (41%) underwent laparoscopic appendectomy, 40,353 (8.6%) underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and 35,152 (7.5%) patients underwent surgery for SBO.

Studies with patients ≥ 65 years undergoing EGS were included. The primary exposure was frailty, measured using the Clinical Frailty Scale or the Modified Frailty Index. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were 90-day and 1-year mortality, length of stay, complications, change in level of care at discharge, and loss of independence. Two independent reviewers screened articles and extracted data. Risk of bias was assessed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. A meta-analysis was performed for 30-day mortality using a random-effects model. Our search yielded 847 articles and six cohort studies were included in the systematic review.

A systematic review was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses standards to identify studies reporting the mortality risk in patients aged over 80 years undergoing emergency general surgery operations. The primary outcome measure was 30-day mortality, which was stratified based on American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status and procedure type. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. Random-effects models were applied to calculate pooled outcome data. Analysis of 66,701 octogenarians from 22 studies showed that the risk of 30-day mortality was 26% (95% confidence interval 18%-34%) for all operations: 29% (95% confidence interval 25%-33%) for emergency laparotomy; 9% (95% confidence interval 1%-23%) for nonlaparotomy emergency operations; 21% (95% confidence interval 13%-30%) for colon resection; 17% (95% confidence interval 11%-25%) for small bowel resection; 9% (95% confidence interval 7%-11%) for adhesiolysis; 6% (95% confidence interval 5.9%-6.8%) for perforated ulcer repair; 3% (95% confidence interval 2.6%-4%) for appendicectomy; 3% (95% confidence interval 2.8%-3.3%) for cholecystectomy; and 5% (95% confidence interval 0.2%-14%) for hernia repair.

    "abstract": "Knowledge on practice patterns for aortic occlusion (AO) in the setting of severe pelvic fractures is limited. This study aimed to describe clinical outcomes based on number and types of interventions after zone 3 resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) deployment. A retrospective review of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Aortic Occlusion for Resuscitation in Trauma and Acute Care Surgery multicenter registry was performed for patients who underwent zone 3 AO from 2013 to 2020. Patients with a blunt mechanism who survived beyond the emergency department were included. Interventions evaluated were preperitoneal pelvic packing (PP), angioembolization (AE), and external fixation (EF) of the pelvis. Management approaches were compared against the primary outcome of mortality. Secondary outcomes included transfusion requirements, overall complications and acute kidney injury (AKI). Of 207 patients who underwent zone 3 AO, 160 (77.3%) fit the inclusion criteria. Sixty (37.5%) underwent AO alone, 50 (31.3%) underwent a second hemostatic intervention, and 49 (30.6%) underwent a third hemostatic intervention. Overall mortality was 37.7% (n = 60). There were no differences in mortality based on any number or combination of interventions. On multivariable regression, only EF was associated with a mortality reduction (odds ratio, 0.22; p = 0.011). Increasing number of interventions were associated with higher transfusion and complication rates. Pelvic packing + AE was associated with increased AKI than PP or AE alone (73.3% vs. 29.5% and 28.6%, p = 0.005), and AE was associated with increased AKI resulting in dialysis than PP alone (17.9% vs. 6.8%, p = 0.036). Zone 3 REBOA can be used as a standalone hemorrhage control technique and as an adjunct in the management of severe pelvic fractures. The only additional intervention associated with a mortality reduction was EF. The benefit of increasing number of interventions must be weighed against more harm. Heterogeneity in practice patterns for REBOA use in pelvic fracture management underscores the need for an evidence base to standardize care. Therapeutic, Level IV."

    "abstract": "To assess how the COVID-19 outbreak has affected emergency general surgery (EGS) care during the pandemic, indications for surgery, types of procedures, perioperative course, and final outcomes. This is a retrospective study of EGS patients during the pandemic period. The main outcome was 30-day morbidity and mortality according to severity and COVID-19 infection status. Secondary outcomes were changes in overall management. A logistic regression analysis was done to assess factors predictive of mortality. One hundred and fifty-three patients were included. Half of the patients with an abdominal ultrasound and/or CT scan had signs of severity at diagnosis, four times higher than the previous year. Non-COVID patients underwent surgery more often than the COVID group. Over 1/3 of 100 operated patients had postoperative morbidity, versus only 15% the previous year. The most common complications were septic shock, pneumonia, and ARDS. ICU care was required in 17% of patients, and was most often required in the SARS-CoV-2-infected group, which also had a higher morbidity and mortality. The 30-day mortality in the surgical series was of 7%, with no differences with the previous year. The strongest independent predictors of overall mortality were age > 70 years, ASA III-IV, ESS > 9, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Non-operative management (NOM) was undertaken in a third of patients, and only 14% of operated patients had a perioperative confirmation of -CoV-2 infection. The severity and morbidity of COVID-19-infected patients was much higher. Late presentations for medical care may have added to the high morbidity of the series."

    "title": "Differences Between Center-level Outcomes in Emergency and Elective General Surgery.",
    "abstract": "Center-level outcome metrics have long been tracked in elective surgery (ELS). Despite recent interest in measuring emergency general surgery (EGS) quality, centers are often compared based on elective or combined outcomes. Therefore, quality of care for emergency surgery specifically is unknown. We extracted data on EGS and ELS patients from the 2016 State Inpatient Databases of Florida, New York, and Kentucky. Centers that performed >100 ELS and EGS operations were included. Risk-adjusted mortality, complication, and failure to rescue (FTR, death after complication) rates were calculated and observed-to-expected ratios were calculated by center for ELS and EGS patients. Centers were determined to be high or low outliers if the 90% CI for the observed: expected ratio excluded 1. We calculated the frequency with which centers demonstrated a different performance status between EGS and ELS. Kendall's tau values were calculated to assess for correlation between EGS and ELS status. A total of 204 centers with 45,500 EGS cases and 49,380 ELS cases met inclusion criteria. Overall mortality, complication, and FTR rates were 1.7%, 8.0%, and 14.5% respectively. There was no significant correlation between mortality performance in EGS and ELS, with 36 centers in a different performance category (high outlier, low outlier, as expected) in EGS than in ELS. The correlation for complication rates was 0.20, with 60 centers in different categories for EGS and ELS. For FTR rates, there was no correlation, with 16 centers changing category. There was minimal correlation between outcomes for ELS and EGS. High performers in one category were rarely high performers in the other. There may be important differences between the processes of care that are important for EGS and ELS outcomes that may yield meaningful opportunities for quality improvement."

    "title": "Readmission After Emergency General Surgery: NSQIP Review of Risk, Cause and Ideal Follow-Up.",
    "abstract": "The Emergency General Surgery (EGS) population is particularly at high risk for readmission. Currently, no system exists to predict which EGS patients are most at risk. We hypothesized that a subset of EGS patients could be identified with increased 30-day unplanned readmission. We also hypothesized that a majority of readmissions occur sooner than the conventional 2-week follow-up period. National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) nonelective general surgery patients were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression identified factors with increased odds of unplanned readmission. AAST EGS Diagnosis Categories were used to categorize postop ICD-9 codes, and the top 10 CPT codes in each group were analyzed. Readmission rate, the reason for unplanned readmission, and time to readmission were analyzed. A total of 383,726 patients were identified with a readmission rate of 8.1% within 30 d of their primary procedure. The top 50 CPT codes accounted for 84% of EGS readmissions. Increased readmission risk was demonstrated for underweight patients (OR = 1.15, P < 0.05). High-risk hospital characteristics were LOS >2 d, any inpatient pulmonary complications, and discharge to any facility or rehab (all P < 0.05). Surgical site infections cause nearly 25% of readmissions. Intestinal procedures are most frequently readmitted (22% of EGS readmissions), with colorectal procedures having the higher odds of readmission. Most readmissions occur <10 d after discharge. A high-risk subpopulation exists within EGS, and most readmissions occur sooner than a typical 2-week follow-up. Early interventions for high-risk EGS subpopulations may allow for early intervention and reduction of unnecessary healthcare utilization."

    "abstract": "The capacity for prompt \"rescue\" from death in patients with complications has become an important marker of the quality of care since mortality and morbidity have been identified as incongruous indicators. This study aims to describe the incidence of \"surgical rescue\" failure and the outcomes of emergency general surgery (EGS) patients at a large academic medical center. In our high-volume surgical hospital, an electronic EGS registry was developed to automatically capture in-hospital information and outcomes from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR). Surgical complications were included in an online application and automatically captured in the electronic EGS registry, and prospectively screened from June to July 2017 for acute EGS surgical patients from operative procedures. A total of 501 patients (average age: 53.9 ± 20.9, 56.5% female) underwent 882 EGS procedures. Thirteen patients (2.6%) of the 501 patients required \"surgical rescue\", mainly for uncontrolled sepsis (43%) and anastomotic leakage (30%). The surgical rescue failure rate (inability to prevent death after a surgical complication) was 15.4%. Patients requiring critical care (OR = 3.3, IC 95%: 1.04, 10.5), hospital admission (p = 0.038), and hospital LOS (days) (p = 0.004) were significantly higher for the surgical rescue patients than for those without complications. Surgical failure to rescue rate was similar among high-volume EGS services, as has recently been described in the United States. The latest development and implementation of an electronic automatic captured EGS registry database in our academic medical center will serve to build best practices for \"surgical rescue\" and drive quality improvement programs."

    "abstract": "Emergency open large bowel procedures have higher rates of intraoperative contamination and increased risk of surgical site infection (SSI) than elective colon surgeries. Several wound management strategies have been proposed, such as vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy and delayed primary closure to improve results. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between wound management technique and SSI and other quality measures. We performed a retrospective review of patients undergoing open emergency colon surgery from January 2017 to December 2018 by our acute care surgery service. The primary outcome measure was incidence of SSI. Secondary outcome measures included length of stay, reoperation, and 30-day readmission. A total of 118 patients were included in the study, with a mean age of 62.8 years and mean BMI of 28.8. Overall incidence of SSI was 19.5%. There was no significant difference in incidence of SSI, reoperation, or 30-day readmission when stratifying by wound management technique or procedure type after controlling for confounding variables. Notably, patients managed with VAC therapy had a statistically significant longer average length of stay and higher total postoperative antibiotic days (both P = .001) than other techniques. We conclude from our data that wound management technique does not seem to influence rate of SSI, but wound management may influence length of stay or antibiotic duration. These findings suggest that there may not be an advantage to alternative methods of wound management in this high-risk population. Further prospective evaluation should be performed to confirm these findings."

    "abstract": "We sought to assess the performance of the Predictive OpTimal Trees in Emergency Surgery Risk (POTTER) tool in elderly emergency surgery (ES) patients. The POTTER tool was derived using a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI)-methodology called optimal classification trees and validated for prediction of ES outcomes. POTTER outperforms all existent risk-prediction models and is available as an interactive smartphone application. Predicting outcomes in elderly patients has been historically challenging and POTTER has not yet been tested in this population. All patients ≥65 years who underwent ES in the ACS-NSQIP 2017 database were included. POTTER's performance for 30-day mortality and 18 postoperative complications (eg, respiratory or renal failure) was assessed using c-statistic methodology, with planned sub-analyses for patients 65 to 74, 75 to 84, and 85+ years. A total of 29,366 patients were included, with mean age 77, 55.8% females, and 62% who underwent emergency general surgery. POTTER predicted mortality accurately in all patients over 65 (c-statistic 0.80). Its best performance was in patients 65 to 74 years (c-statistic 0.84), and its worst in patients ≥85 years (c-statistic 0.71). POTTER had the best discrimination for predicting septic shock (c-statistic 0.90), respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation for ≥48 hours (c-statistic 0.86), and acute renal failure (c-statistic 0.85). POTTER is a novel, interpretable, and highly accurate predictor of in-hospital mortality in elderly ES patients up to age 85 years. POTTER could prove useful for bedside counseling and for benchmarking of ES care."

    "abstract": "Efficient Emergency Department (ED) throughput depends on several factors, including collaboration and consultation with surgical services. The acute care surgery service (ACS) collaborated with ED to implement a new process termed \"FASTPASS\" (FP), which might improve patient-care for those with acute appendicitis and gallbladder disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 1-year outcome of FP. FASTPASS is a joint collaboration between ACS and ED. ED physicians were provided with a simple check-list for diagnosing young males (<50-year old) with acute appendicitis (AA) and young males or females (<50-year old) with gallbladder disease (GBD). Once ED deemed patients fit our FP check-list, patients were directly admitted (FASTPASSed) to the observation unit. The ACS then came to evaluate the patients for possible surgical intervention. We performed outcome analysis before and after the institution of the FP. Outcomes of interest were ED length of stay (LOS), time from ED to the operating room (OR) (door-to-knife), hospital LOS (HLOS), and cost. During our 1-year study period, for those patients who underwent GBD/AA surgery, 56 (26%) GBD and 27 (26%) AA patients met FP criteria. Compared to the non-FP patients during FP period, FP halved ED LOS for GBD (7.4 ± 3.0 versus 3.5 ± 1.7 h, P < 0.001) and AA (6.7 ± 3.3 versus. 1.8 ± 1.6 h, P < 0.001). Similar outcome benefits were observed for door-to-knife time, HLOS, and costs. In this study, the FP process improved ED throughput in a single, highly-trained ER leading to an overall improved patient care process. A future study involving multiple EDs and different disease processes may help decrease ED overcrowding and improve healthcare system efficiency."

    "title": "Factors associated with Interhospital transfers of emergency general surgery patients from emergency departments.",
    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) conditions account for over 3 million or 7.1% of hospitalizations per year in the US. Patients are increasingly transferred from community emergency departments (EDs) to larger centers for care, and a growing demand for treating EGS conditions mandates a better understanding of how ED clinicians transfer patients. We identify patient, clinical, and organizational characteristics associated with interhospital transfers of EGS patients originating from EDs in the United States. We analyze data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) for the years 2010-2014. Patient-level sociodemographic characteristics, clinical factors, and hospital-level factors were examined as predictors of transfer from the ED to another acute care hospital. Multivariable logistic regression analysis includes patient and hospital characteristics as predictors of transfer from an ED to another acute care hospital. Of 47,442,892 ED encounters (weighted) between 2008 and 2014, 1.9% resulted in a transfer. Multivariable analysis indicates that men (Odds ratio (OR) 1.18 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI) 1.16-1.21) and older patients (OR 1.02 (95% CI 1.02-1.02)) were more likely to be transferred. Relative to patients with private health insurance, patients covered by Medicare (OR 1.09 (95% CI 1.03-1.15) or other insurance (OR 1.34 (95% CI 1.07-1.66)) had a higher odds of transfer. Odds of transfer increased with a greater number of comorbid conditions compared to patients with an EGS diagnosis alone. EGS diagnoses predicting transfer included resuscitation (OR 36.72 (95% CI 30.48-44.22)), cardiothoracic conditions (OR 8.47 (95% CI 7.44-9.63)), intestinal obstruction (OR 4.49 (95% CI 4.00-5.04)), and conditions of the upper gastrointestinal tract (OR 2.82 (95% CI 2.53-3.15)). Relative to Level I or II trauma centers, hospitals with a trauma designation III or IV had a 1.81 greater odds of transfer. Transfers were most likely to originate at rural hospitals (OR 1.69 (95% CI 1.43-2.00)) relative to urban non-teaching hospitals. Medically complex and older patients who present at small, rural hospitals are more likely to be transferred. Future research on the unique needs of rural hospitals and timely transfer of EGS patients who require specialty surgical care have the potential to significantly improve outcomes and reduce costs."

    "abstract": "Moderate and severe traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are a major cause of severe morbidity and mortality; rapid diagnosis and management allow secondary injury to be minimized. Traumatic brain injury is only one of many potential causes of altered mental status; head computed tomography (HCT) is used to definitively diagnose TBI. Despite its widespread use and obvious importance, interpretation of HCT images is rarely covered by formal didactics during general surgery or even acute care surgery training. The schema illustrated here may be applied in a rapid and reliable fashion to HCT images, expediting the diagnosis of clinically significant traumatic brain injury that warrants emergent medical and surgical therapies to reduce intracranial pressure. It consists of 7 normal anatomic structures (cerebrospinal fluid around the brain stem, open fourth ventricle, \"baby's butt,\" \"Mickey Mouse ears,\" absence of midline shift, sulci and gyri, and gray-white differentiation). These 7 features can be seen even as the CT scanner obtains images, allowing the trauma team to expedite medical management of intracranial hypertension and pursue neurosurgical consultation prior to radiologic interpretation if the features are abnormal."

Single-institution studies have validated the cholecystitis grading system as associated with patient outcomes. Our aim was to validate the grading system in a multi-institutional fashion and compare it with the Parkland grade and Tokyo Guidelines for acute cholecystitis. Patients presenting with acute cholecystitis to 1 of 8 institutions were enrolled. Discrete data to assign the AAST grade were collected. The Parkland grade was collected prospectively from the operative surgeon from four institutions. Parkland grade, Tokyo Guidelines, AAST grade, and the AAST preoperative grade (clinical and imaging subscales) were compared using linear and logistic regression to the need for surgical \"bailout\" (subtotal or fenestrated cholecystectomy, or cholecystostomy), conversion to open, surgical complications (bile leak, surgical site infection, bile duct injury), all complications, and operative time. Of 861 patients, 781 underwent cholecystectomy. Mean (SD) age was 51.1 (18.6), and 62.7% were female. There were six deaths. Median AAST grade was 2 (interquartile range [IQR], 1-2), and median Parkland grade was 3 (interquartile range [IQR], 2-4). Median AAST clinical and imaging grades were 2 (IQR, 2-2) and 1 (IQR, 0-1), respectively. Higher grades were associated with longer operative times, and worse outcomes although few were significant. The Parkland grade outperformed the AAST grade based on area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The AAST cholecystitis grading schema has modest discriminatory power similar to the Tokyo Guidelines, but generally lower than the Parkland grade, and should be modified before widespread use.

    "abstract": "Admissions due to emergency general surgery (EGS) are on the rise, and patients who undergo emergency surgery are at increased risk of mortality. We hypothesized that utilization of palliative care and discharge to hospice in the EGS population have increased over time and that this is associated with a decrease in inpatient mortality. Using the 2002-2011 nationwide inpatient sample and American Association for the Surgery of Trauma-defined EGS diagnosis codes, we identified patients ≥18 years old with an EGS admission. Demographics, hospitalization characteristics, mortality, use of palliative care services, and discharge to hospice were queried. All Patient Refined-Diagnosis Related Group risk of mortality was used to categorize those with an extreme likelihood of dying (ELD). Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate the association between palliative care consult and discharge to hospice. Of the included patients, 0.3% received palliative care and 0.2% were discharged to hospice. Over time, rates of palliative care and hospice discharge increased while inpatient mortality decreased. In the 4% of patients with ELD, 3% received palliative care, 5% were transitioned to hospice care, and 22% suffered inpatient mortality. Controlling for patient characteristics, utilization of palliative care services was associated with increased odds of discharge to hospice compared to inpatient mortality (OR = 1.78 all patients and OR = 2.04 for ELD). Despite the known increased risks associated with emergency surgical diagnoses, palliative care services remain infrequently utilized in the EGS population. This may be an opportunity for lessening suffering, improving patient-concordant care and outcomes, and reducing nonbeneficial and unwanted care."

We hypothesized that an FT pathway for acute cholecystitis patients would decrease patient length of stay and resource utilization. All patients at two hospitals, one with an FT pathway and one with a traditional pathway, who underwent an urgent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis between May 1, 2019, and October 31, 2019, were queried using CPT codes. Exclusion criteria were conversion to open or partial cholecystectomy. Retrospective chart review was used to gather demographics, operative, hospital course, and outcomes. Time to operating room, hospital length of stay, and resource utilization were the primary outcomes. There was a total of 479 urgent laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed, 430 (89.8%) were performed under the FT pathway. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) time to the operating room was not different: 14.1 hours (IQR, 8.3-29.0 hours) for FT and 18.5 hours (IQR, 11.9-25.9 hours) for traditional (p = 0.316). However, the median length of stay was shorter by 15.9 hours in the FT cohort (22.6 hours; IQR, 14.2-40.4 hours vs. 38.5 hours; IQR, 28.3-56.3 hours; p < 0.001). Under the FT pathway, 33.0% of patients were admitted to the hospital and 75.6% were discharged from the postanesthesia care unit, compared with 91.8% and 12.2% on the traditional pathway (both p < 0.001). There were 59.6% of the FT patients that received a phone call follow up, as opposed to 100% of the traditional patients having clinic follow up (p < 0.001). The emergency department bounce back rate, readmission rates, and complication rates were similar (p > 0.2 for all). On multivariate analysis, having a FT pathway was an independent predictor of discharge within 24 hours of surgical consultation (odds ratio, 7.65; 95% confidence interval< 2.90-20.15; p < 0.001). Use of a FT program for patients with acute cholecystitis has a significant positive impact on resource utilization without compromise of clinical outcomes. Therapeutic/care management, level IV."

Methods: We examined the association between management and adverse outcomes in a cohort of emergency general surgery patients aged > 65 years. This multi-center study included 727 patients (mean+/-SD, 77.1 ± 8.2 years, 54% female) admitted to five UK hospitals. Data were analyzed using multi-level crude and multivariable logistic regression. Outcomes were: mortality at Day 30 and 90, length of stay, and readmission within 30 days of discharge. Covariates assessed were management approach, age, sex, frailty, polypharmacy, anemia, and hypoalbuminemia. Results: Approximately 25% of participants (n = 185) underwent emergency surgery. Frailty and albumin were associated with mortality at 30 (frailty OR = 3.52 [95% CI 1.66-7.49], albumin OR = 3.78 ([95% CI 1.53-9.31]), and 90 days post discharge (frailty OR = 3.20 [95% CI 1.86-5.51], albumin OR=3.25 [95% CI 1.70-6.19]) and readmission (frailty OR = 1.56 [95% CI (1.04-2.35)]). Surgically managed patients and frailty had increased odds of prolonged hospitalization (surgery OR = 5.69 [95% CI 3.67-8.80], frailty OR = 2.17 [95% CI 1.46-3.23]). Conclusion: We found the impact of surgery on length of hospitalization in older surgical patients is substantial. Whether early comprehensive geriatric assessment and post-op rehabilitation would improve this outcome require further evaluation."

We conducted an analysis of the acute care surgery registry at Salima District Hospital in Malawi from June 2018 to November 2019. We examined patient characteristics, interventions, and outcomes. Modified Poisson regression modeling was used to identify risk factors for transfer to a tertiary center and mortality of patients transferred to the tertiary center. Eight hundred eighty-eight patients were analyzed. The most common diagnosis was skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) at 35.9%. 27.5% of patients were transferred to Salima District Hospital, primarily from health centers, with a third for a diagnosis of SSTI. Debridement of SSTI comprised 59% of performed procedures (n = 241). Of the patients that required exploratory laparotomy, only 11 laparotomies were performed, with 59 patients transferred to a tertiary hospital. The need for laparotomy conferred an adjusted risk ratio (RR) of 10.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.1, 14.3) for transfer to the central hospital. At the central hospital, for patients who needed urgent abdominal exploration, surgery had a 0.16 RR of mortality (95% CI 0.05, 0.50) while time to evaluation greater than 48 h at the central hospital had a 2.81 RR of death (95% CI 1.19, 6.66). Despite available capacity, laparotomy was rarely performed at this district hospital, and delays in care led to a higher mortality. Optimization of the district and health center surgical ecosystems is imperative to improve surgical access in Malawi and improve patient outcomes."

We aimed to develop a user-friendly toolbox (risk identification, outcome prediction and patient stratification) to support when to involve a senior surgeon. We included 11,901 general surgery patients (10.0% emergencies) in a multicenter prospective cohort in China (2015-2016). Patient information and surgeons' seniority were compared between emergency and elective surgery with the same procedure codes. Risk indicators common in these two surgical timings and specific to emergency surgery were identified, and their clinical importance was evaluated by a working group of 48 experienced surgeons. Predictive models for mortality and morbidity were built using logistic regression models. Stratification rules were created to balance patients' risk and surgeons' caseload with an Acute Call Team (ACT) model. Emergency patients had significantly higher risks of mortality (3.6% vs 0.6%) and morbidity (7.8% vs 4.3%) than elective patients, but disproportionally fewer senior surgeons (59.9% vs 91.4%) were present. Using three risk indicators (American Society of Anesthesiologists score, age, blood urea nitrogen), C-statistic (95% CI) for prediction of emergency mortality was high [0.90 (0.84-0.96)]. It was less complex but equally accurate as two existing and validated models (0.86 [0.79-0.93] and 0.86 [0.77-0.95]). Using five indicators, C-statistic (95% CI) was moderate for prediction of overall morbidity [0.77 (0.72-0.83)], but high for severe morbidity [0.92 (0.88-0.97)]. Based on stratification rules of the ACT model, patient mortality and morbidity were 0.5% and 5.3% in the low-risk stratum (composing 64.6% of emergency caseload), and 15.9% and 29.0% in the very high-risk stratum (6.9% of caseload). These findings show the practical feasibility of using a risk assessment tool to direct senior surgeons' involvement in emergency general surgery."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery patients are at an increased risk for morbidity and mortality compared to their elective surgery counterparts. The complex nature of emergency general surgery conditions can challenge community hospitals, which may lack appropriate systems and personnel. Outcomes related to transfer have not been well-established. We aimed to compare postoperative outcomes of patients who were transferred from another hospital to a center with dedicated acute care surgery services with patients admitted directly to the acute care surgery centers. We performed a secondary analysis of a national, multicenter review of emergency general surgery patients undergoing complex emergency general surgery at 5 centers across Canada. The primary outcome was the development of any complication. The adjusted odds of postoperative complication was assessed using logistic regression, controlling for age, comorbidities, duration of stay before transfer, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, and booking priority. A total of 1,846 patients were included in the study, and 176 (9.5%) were transferred. Of these 21% (n = 37) underwent an operative procedure, and 15% (n = 27) underwent an operation at the transferring center. Transferred patients were more likely to have at least 1 comorbidity (68% vs 57%; P = .004), were classified as greater urgency on arrival (<2 hours booking priority, 43% vs 17%; P < .001), had a greater American Society of Anesthesiologists classification (American Society of Anesthesiologists ≥3 = 81% vs 65%; P < .001), a greater duration of operation (119 vs 110 minutes; P = .004), and were more likely to undergo a second operation (28% vs 14%; P < .001) compared to patients directly admitted to an acute care surgery center. On univariate analysis, transferred patients had greater rates of complications (48% vs 31%; P < .001), mortality (14% vs 7%; P = .005), and admission to the intensive care unit (22% vs 12%; P < .001). Transfer status remained an independent predictor of complication (odds ratio 1.9 [95% confidence interval 1.3-2.7]; P < .001) and intensive care unit admission (odds ratio 1.9 [95% confidence interval 1.2-3.0]; P = .007), but not mortality (odds ratio 1.1 [95% confidence interval 0.6-1.9]; P = .79) on regression analysis. Complex emergency general surgery patients transferred to acute care surgery centers may have worse outcomes and greater use of resources compared to those admitted directly. This finding has clinically and financially important implications for the design and regionalization of acute care surgery services as well as resource allocation at acute care surgery centers."

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has placed a significant strain on healthcare resources and utilisation globally. The appearance of the disease in the Republic of Ireland resulted in a broad postponement of scheduled and routine surgical care. The influence of the novel coronavirus, and the associated imposition of public health measures such as school closures and social distancing, on the burden of emergency surgical disease is less clear. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the number of patients presenting to our institution with emergent surgical illnesses or requiring emergency general surgical procedures. All patients attending our service between March 1st 2020 and April 30th 2020 were identified retrospectively by examining electronic handover and electronic discharge summaries, and data were collected relating to demographics, presenting illness, critical care utilisation, length of stay, operative or endoscopic procedure performed, and in-hospital mortality. Similar data were collected March 1st to April 30th 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively to allow direct comparison. 151 patients were admitted during the study period, compared to a total of 788 during the proceeding three years (mean 2.49 admissions per night versus 4.35 per night, 42.8% reduction, p < 0.001). Median age of admitted patients was 51.8 years, compared to 50.3 years formerly (p = 0.35). 53 emergency procedures were performed, compared to a median of 70 over the same period in the previous years (mean 0.87 per day versus 1.16 per day, 25.4% reduction, p = 0.05). A significant overall reduction in the number of patients being admitted to our unit and requiring emergency surgical procedures during March and April 2020 was seen, in line with patterns reported internationally."

    "abstract": "Owing to improved quality of computed tomography, a new category of complicated acute diverticulitis, including patients with pericolic air but without abscess formation, can be defined (Hinchey 1a). Recent studies question whether this new category of acute diverticulitis could be treated as uncomplicated cases. The aim of our study is to report on the clinical course of acute diverticulitis Hinchey 1a in current clinical practice. For this multicenter retrospective cohort study, patients presenting at the emergency department with Hinchey 1a acute diverticulitis as demonstrated by computed tomography scan, were identified. The primary outcome measure was successful conservative treatment with observation alone, antibiotics, and/or hospital admission. Readmissions, percutaneous drainage of abscesses, and emergency operations were considered as failure. Between October 2016 and October 2018, 1,199 patients were clinically suspected for acute diverticulitis, of whom 101 (8.4%) were radiologically diagnosed to have type 1a acute diverticulitis (average age 57 (±13) years, 45% female) and started with conservative treatment. This was successful in 86 (85%) patients. One of the 15 unsuccessfully treated patients (1%) received percutaneous drainage of an abdominal abscess. Surgery was required in 9 cases (9%) after a median time of 6 days (range, 3 to 69 days). Although a difference in the volume of extraluminal air on computed tomography scan was found, this was not shown to be a risk factor for the clinical course. Patients with type 1a acute diverticulitis can be treated successfully by conservative therapy in the majority of cases (85%). More research is required to define predictive factors for successful conservative management."

    "abstract": "The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) recently developed a classification system to standardize outcomes analyses for several emergency general surgery conditions. To highlight this system's full potential, we conducted a study integrating prospective AAST grade assignment within the electronic medical record. Our institution integrated AAST grade assignment into our clinical workflow in July 2018. Patients with acute diverticulitis were prospectively assigned AAST grades and modified Hinchey classes at the time of surgical consultation. Support vector machine-a machine learning algorithm attuned for small sample sizes-was used to compare the associations between the two classification systems and decision to operate and incidence of complications. 67 patients were included (median age of 62 y, 40% male) for analysis. The decision for operative management, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit admission, and intensive care unit length of stay were associated with both increasing AAST grade and increasing modified Hinchey class (all P < 0.001). AAST grade additionally showed a correlation with complication severity (P = 0.02). Compared with modified Hinchey class, AAST grade better predicted decision to operate (88.2% versus 82.4%). This study showed the feasibility of electronic medical record integration to support the full potential of AAST classification system's utility as a clinical decision-making tool. Prospectively assigned AAST grade may be an accurate and pragmatic method to find associations with outcomes, yet validation requires further study."

    "abstract": "We would like to thank Dr Ewington et al. for the commentary on our review about prognostic factors in burns. First we would like to comment on the role of frailty in assessment of burns. The elderly population is of special interest in all fields of clinical medicine, owing to the ageing of the world population [1]. The definition of frailty is relatively concise. It is defined as a state of depletion of the homeostatic reserve due to changes accumulated during lifetime. In consequence, resolution of stressor sequelae is impaired [2]. Although the definition is straightforward, the methods of its application and quantification of frailty are not unequivocally accepted [3]. Ward and Romanowski in their papers used the Clinical Frailty Scale [4]. Other developed scales, to mention only a few, are the general Korean Frailty Index for Primary Care [5], the Modified Frailty Index 5 (mFI-5) [6], the more specialized Emergency General Surgery Frailty Index [7], and the Burn Frailty Index [8]. Some of them were evaluated in surgery patients, and the Burn Frailty Index was developed by Maxwell specifically to be used in burn patients [8]. A study comparing the usefulness of various frailty scales in a burn ward would be a welcome addition to the discussion about burn outcomes. We would also like to address one more aspect of frailty. Generally, the term is connected with the elderly population, i.e. more than 65 years old. This is based on the fact that one's frailty is a sum of deficits accumulated over the whole lifetime [9]. Yet even in younger age groups various tools used to assess frailty show a relatively high percentage of frail people [10, 11]. Research including patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery has proven that frailty assessment is a viable choice to predict complications even in younger groups [12]. Therefore we assume that frailty indexes will gradually become tools used also in younger groups of patients."

    "abstract": "In this aging society, older patients are more commonly undergoing emergency general surgery (EGS). Although frailty has been associated with worse outcomes in this population, EGS encompasses a heterogeneous mix of procedures. To determine if the association of frailty with morbidity and mortality in EGS patients varies based on the level of procedural risk. This cross-sectional study analyzed Medicare inpatient claims file (January 2007-December 2015) and included all inpatients who underwent 1 of 7 previously described EGS procedures shown to represent 80% of EGS volume, complications, and mortality nationally. Analysis took place from September 2019 to January 2020. The primary exposure of interest was risk procedural level. EGS procedures were stratified as high risk (excision of small intestine, excision of large intestine, peptic ulcer repair, lysis of peritoneal adhesions, and laparotomy) and low risk (appendectomy and cholecystectomy). The primary outcome was overall 30-day mortality after discharge. Frailty was assessed using a claims-based frailty index. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used and was stratified by risk level. A total of 882 929 EGS patients were included in this study (mean [SD] age, 77.9 [7.5] years; 483 637 [54%] were female). Overall mortality was 4.5% (n = 40 304). The frailty index classified 12.6% (n = 111 513) of patients as frail, and mortality within this group was 9.9% (n = 11 307). High-risk procedures represented 53% (n = 468 098) of the caseload, and mortality was 6.8% (n = 31 979). For low-risk procedures, mortality was 2% (n = 8325). Frailty was significantly associated with mortality (odds ratio, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.60-1.68). After stratified analysis, this association remained significant for high-risk (odds ratio, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.49-1.58) and low-risk (odds ratio, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.94-2.17) procedures. Frailty was significantly associated with mortality in patients undergoing EGS, with an even greater association in low-risk procedures. Preoperative frailty assessment is imperative even in low-risk procedures."

    "abstract": "Chronic opioid use is prevalent among patients undergoing emergent surgery. We sought to understand it on the outcomes of the most common emergency surgery procedures, Appendectomy and Cholecystectomy. We used the National Inpatient Sample to identify chronic opioid use in emergency appendectomies (n = 953) and cholecystectomies (n = 2826) from 2005 to 2014. Primary outcome was length of stay (LOS), and secondary outcomes included total charges and mortality. LOS was analyzed with multivariate Poisson regression, total charges with multivariate linear regression. For Appendectomy, the opioid abuse group was younger, had similar gender and racial demographics, had more Medicaid and private insurance and less self-pay, and had no clinically significant differences in comorbidities. Those with chronic opioid use had a 24% increased LOS (20-29%, p < .001) and $5532(±$881, p < .001) higher hospital charges. Mortality was very rare and not different (0.2% vs 0.6%, aOR 0.54 [0.11-2.58], p = .44). For Cholecystectomy, the opioid abuse group was similar in age and gender, had slightly more white individuals, had a slightly different payor mix including higher rate of private insurance, and had no clinically significant differences in comorbidities. Patients with preoperative chronic opioid abuse showed a 14% increased LOS (12-16%, p < .001) and $5352 (± $1065, p < .001) higher hospital charges, but no significant increase in mortality (0.7% vs 0.6%, aOR 1.58 [0.77-3.25], p = .22). Patients with chronic opioid abuse did not have increased mortality following EGS but had increased resource utilization and LOS. These findings may help explore the impact of opioid abuse on hospital and societal cost."

    "abstract": "The role of an acute care surgery (ACS) service during the COVID-19 pandemic is not well established. A retrospective review of the ACS service performance in an urban tertiary academic medical center. The study was performed between January and May 2020. The demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of patients treated by the ACS service 2 months prior to the COVID surge (pre-COVID group) and during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic (surge group) were compared. Trauma and emergency general surgery volumes decreased during the surge by 38% and 57%, respectively; but there was a 64% increase in critically ill patients. The proportion of patients in the Department of Surgery treated by the ACS service increased from 40% pre-COVID to 67% during the surge. The ACS service performed 32% and 57% of all surgical cases in the Department of Surgery during the pre-COVID and surge periods, respectively. The ACS service managed 23% of all critically ill patients in the institution during the surge. Critically ill patients with and without confirmed COVID-19 infection treated by ACS and non-ACS intensive care units during the surge did not differ in demographics, indicators of clinical severity, or hospital mortality:13.4% vs. 13.5% (P = .99) for all critically ill patients; and 13.9% vs. 27.4% (P = .12) for COVID-19 critically ill patients.

    "abstract": "Defining the work performed by emergency general surgery (EGS) surgeons has relied on quantifying surgical interventions, failing to include nonsurgical management performed. The purpose of this study was to identify the extent of operative and nonoperative patient management provided by an EGS service line in response to consults from other hospital providers. This is a retrospective descriptive study of all adult patients with an EGS consult request placed from July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2016 at a 1000-bed tertiary referral center. Consult requests were classified by suspected diagnosis and linked to patient demographic and clinical information. Operative and nonoperative cases were compared. About 4998 EGS consults were requested during the 2-y period, of which 69.6% were placed on the first day of the patient encounter. Disposition outcomes after consultation included admission to the EGS service (27.6%) and discharge from the emergency department (25.3%). Small bowel obstruction, appendicitis, and cholecystitis decisively comprised the top three diagnoses for overall consults and those requiring admission to the EGS service. For every consult requiring an operation (n = 1400), 2.6 consults were managed without an operation (n = 3598). EGS surgeons are asked to evaluate and manage a variety of potentially surgical diagnoses. As most consults do not require surgical intervention, operative volume is a poor surrogate for quantifying EGS productivity. The role of this service is vital to patient triage and disposition, particularly in the emergency department setting. Institutions should consider the volume of their nonoperative consultations when evaluating EGS service line workload and in guiding staffing needs."

    "abstract": "Obstructed colon cancer is not an uncommon surgical emergency. Many other surgical diseases may overlap their presenting symptoms. This paper aims to report a colon cancer case with delayed diagnosis due to a long-standing para-umbilical hernia (PUH). 60-year-old female patient presented to our emergency department (ED) with an obstructed PUH. The patient underwent watchful conservative management many times before due to associated comorbidities. This history of recurrent intestinal obstruction and incomplete regain of regular bowel habits after every hospital admission raises the possibility for concealed pathology. Further investigations, including computed tomography (CT), revealed a suspicion of an obstructed malignant mass at the colon's splenic flexure accompanied with complete bowel obstruction. The patient and their family consulted for exploratory laparotomy and the possibility of stoma formation. The intra-operative finding was constant with a small ventral defect, and a dilated bowel loops up to a left colon transition zone. We achieved left hemicolectomy with a primary anastomosis after intra-operative bowel lavage. The postoperative period was uneventfully, and the patient was discharged home after seven days of admission. Follow up in the outpatient surgical clinic for three months revealed no recordable complications. The patient had transferred to the oncology center for the completion of adjuvant therapy. This case had a small PUH with recurrent obstruction. The delay in its management was due to the patient's comorbidities. However, the incomplete resolution of patient symptoms during watchful oversight increases the likelihood of another hidden pathology that required further investigation. We expanded CT indication in such patients to find the exact cause of patient symptoms, especially chronic constipation and incomplete recovery after every admission. While concurrent pathology is the norm in elective surgery and can be dealt with safely, in non-elective surgery, a thorough search about the patient's exact complaints is mandatory to decrease morbidity and mortality rates. In the same patient, both colon cancer and abdominal wall hernias can produce conflicting symptoms and delay diagnosis. However, with a high index of suspicion and correlation of patient symptoms, can be safely managed without morbidity."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) encompasses a heterogeneous population of acutely ill patients, and standardized methods for determining disease severity are essential for comparative effectiveness research and quality improvement initiatives. The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) has developed a grading system for the anatomic severity of 16 EGS conditions; however, little is known regarding how well these AAST EGS grades can be approximated by diagnosis codes in administrative databases. We identified adults admitted for 16 common EGS conditions in the 2012 to 2017q3 National Inpatient Sample. Disease severity strata were assigned using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes based on AAST EGS anatomic severity grades. We evaluated whether assigned EGS severity (multiple strata or dichotomized into less versus more complex) were associated with in-hospital mortality, complications, length of stay, discharge disposition, and costs. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, hospital traits, geography, and year. We identified 10,886,822 EGS admissions. The number of anatomic severity strata derived from ICD-9/10-CM codes varied by EGS condition and by year. Four conditions mapped to four strata across all years. Two conditions mapped to four strata with ICD-9-CM codes but only two or three strata with ICD-10-CM codes. Others mapped to three or fewer strata. When dichotomized into less versus more complex disease, patients with more complex disease had worse outcomes across all 16 conditions. The addition of multiple strata beyond a binary measure of complex disease, however, showed inconsistent results. Classification of common EGS conditions according to anatomic severity is feasible with International Classification of Diseases codes. No condition mapped to five distinct severity grades, and the relationship between increasing grade and outcomes was not consistent across conditions. However, a standardized measure of severity, even if just dichotomized into less versus more complex, can inform ongoing efforts aimed at optimizing outcomes for EGS patients across the nation.

The Nationwide Readmissions Database (2017) was queried for adult patients readmitted after an EGS procedure. Patients were stratified and propensity-matched according to readmission destination: index versus nonindex hospital. Outcomes were failure to rescue (FTR), mortality, number of subsequent readmissions, overall hospital length of stay, and total costs. Hierarchical logistic regression was performed to account for clustering effect within hospitals and adjusting for patient- and hospital-level potential confounding factors. A total of 471,570 EGS patients were identified, of which 79,127 (16.8%) were readmitted within 30 days: index hospital (61,472; 77.7%) versus nonindex hospital (17,655; 22.3%).

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) is common and highly morbid for older adults, particularly for those who are frail. However, there are little data on the quality of end-of-life care (EOLC) for this population. We sought to examine the association of frailty with intensity of EOLC for older adults with and without frailty who undergo EGS but die within one year. This retrospective cohort study included 100% Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries, ≥66 years, who underwent one of five EGS procedures with the highest mortality (partial colectomy, small bowel resection, peptic ulcer disease repair, adhesiolysis, or laparotomy) between 2008 and 2014 and died within one year. A validated claims-based frailty index (CFI) identified patients who were not frail (CFI < 0.15), prefrail (0.15 ≤ CFI < 0.25), mildly frail (0.25 ≤ CFI < 0.35), and moderately to severe frail (CFI ≥ 0.35). Multivariable adjusted logistic or Poisson regression compared post-discharge and EOL healthcare utilization. Among 138,916 older EGS adults who died within one year, 32.2% were not frail, 31.7% were prefrail, 29.8% had mild frailty and 6.3% had moderate-to-severe frailty. Decedents with any degree of frailty experienced high-intensity EOLC (P < 0.01), low rates of hospice use (P < 0.01), and fewer days at home. Of those who survived the index hospitalization but died within one year, moderate-to-severely frail decedents had the highest odds of visiting an emergency department (odds ratio [OR] = 1.19, CI = 1.13-1.27), rehospitalization (OR = 1.23, CI = 1.16-1.31), or an intensive care unit admission (OR = 1.22, CI = 1.13-1.30) in the last 30 days of life compared to nonfrail decedents. While all older patients undergoing EGS have poor end-of-life outcomes, frail EGS patients receive the highest intensity EOLC and represent a vulnerable population for whom targeted interventions could limit burdensome treatment."

    "abstract": "Objective Emergency general surgery (EGS) patients experience superior outcomes when cared for within an acute surgical unit (ASU) model. EGS structures in most Australian hospitals remain unknown. This study aimed to describe the national spectrum of EGS models. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed of all Australian public hospitals of medium or greater peer group (>2000 patient separations per annum). The primary outcome was the incidence of each EGS model. Secondary outcomes were the relationship of the EGS model to objective hospital variables, and qualitative reasons for the choice of model. Results Of the 120 eligible hospitals, 119 (99%) participated. Sixty-four hospitals reported using an ASU (28%) or hybrid EGS model (26%), whereas the remaining 55 (46%) used a traditional model. ASU implementation was significantly more common among hospitals of greater peer group, bed number, surgeon pool and trauma service sophistication. Leading drivers for ASU commencement were aims to improve patient care and decrease after-hours operating, whereas common barriers against uptake were insufficient EGS patient load or surgeon on-call pool. Conclusions ASU or hybrid models of care may be more widespread than currently reported. The introduction of such structures is heavily dependent on hospital and staff size, trauma subspecialisation and EGS patient throughput. What is known about the topic? Traditionally, general surgical staff were rostered to elective operating and clinic duties, with emergency patients managed on an ad hoc basis. An ASU model, with a surgeon dedicated to EGS patients, has been associated with superior outcomes. However, the Australian uptake of this model is unknown. What does this paper add? This study enrolled 119 of 120 (99%) Australian public hospitals of medium or greater peer group (>2000 patient separations per annum). Uptake of the ASU or hybrid model was more widespread than expected, existing in 64 of 119 (54%) centres. Factors for and against ASU implementation were also assessed. What are the implications for practitioners? Hospitals considering implementing an ASU or hybrid model will be reassured by the common reports of improved patient outcomes and decreased after-hours operating. However, potential hospitals must assess the suitability of the ASU model to their surgeon pool and EGS patient load."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is one of the most common emergency surgery conditions worldwide, and the incidence is increasing in low- and middle-income countries. Disparities in access to care can lead to disproportionate morbidity and mortality in resource-limited settings; however, outcomes following an appendectomy in low- and middle-income countries remain poorly described. Therefore, we aimed to describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients with appendicitis presenting to a tertiary care center in Malawi. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH) Acute Care Surgery database from 2013 to 2020. We included all patients ≥13 years with a postoperative diagnosis of acute appendicitis. We performed bivariate analysis by mortality, followed by a modified Poisson regression analysis to determine predictors of mortality. We treated 214 adults at KCH for acute appendicitis. The majority experienced prehospital delays to care, presenting at least 1 week from symptom onset (n = 99, 46.3%). Twenty (9.4%) patients had appendiceal perforation. Mortality was 5.6%. The presence of a postoperative complication the only statistically significant predictor of mortality (RR 5.1 [CI 1.13-23.03], P = 0.04) when adjusting for age, shock, transferring, and time to presentation. Delay to intervention due to inadequate access to care predisposes our population for worse postoperative outcomes. The increased risk of mortality associated with resultant surgical complications suggests that failure to rescue is a significant contributor to appendicitis-related deaths at KCH. Improvement in barriers to diagnosis and management of complications is necessary to reduce further preventable deaths from this disease."

Acute mesenteric venous thrombosis is nowadays relatively more often diagnosed with intravenous contrast-enhanced computed tomography in the portal phase than at explorative laparotomy No high-quality comparative studies between anticoagulation alone, endovascular therapy, or surgery exists. The aim of the present systematic review was to offer a contemporary overview on management. Eleven relevant published original studies with series of at least ten patients were retrieved from a Pub Med search between 2015 and 2020 using the Medical Subject Heading term \"mesenteric venous thrombosis.\" When MVT is diagnosed early, immediate anticoagulation with either unfractionated heparin or subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin should commence. Surgeons need to be aware of the importance to scrutinize the computed tomography images themselves for assessment of secondary intestinal abnormalities to mesenteric venous thrombosis and the risk of bowel resection and worse prognosis. Progression toward peritonitis is an indication for explorative laparotomy and assessment of bowel viability. Frank transmural small bowel necrosis should be resected and bowel anastomosis may be delayed for several days until second look. Meanwhile, intravenous full-dose unfractionated heparin should be given at the end of the first operation. Postoperative major intra-abdominal or gastrointestinal bleeding occurs rarely, but the heparin effect can instantaneously be reversed by protamine sulfate. Patients who do not improve during conservative therapy with anticoagulation alone but without developing peritonitis may be subjected to endovascular therapy in expert centers. When the patient's intestinal function has recovered, with or without bowel resection, switch from parenteral unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin therapy to oral anticoagulation can be performed. There is a trend that direct oral anticoagulants are increasingly used instead of vitamin K antagonists. Up to now, direct oral anticoagulants have been shown to be equally effective with the same rate of bleeding complications. Patients with no strong permanent trigger factor for mesenteric venous thrombosis such as intra-abdominal cancer should undergo blood screening for inherited and acquired thrombophilia. Early diagnosis with emergency computed tomography with intravenous contrast-enhancement and imaging in the portal phase and anticoagulation therapy is necessary to be able to have a succesful non-operative succesful course."

    "abstract": "For trauma patients with noncompressible truncal hemorrhage (NCTH), aortic occlusion (AO) is attempted with either resuscitative thoracotomy (RT) or the resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA). However, it is often challenging to identify the group of patients who would benefit from AO procedures. We hypothesized that patients who met simple clinical criteria would have better outcomes following AO procedures. This is a retrospective cohort study using the Aortic Occlusion for Resuscitation in Trauma and Acute Care Surgery database (November 2013-August 2019) which included patients who arrived with signs of life and underwent AO procedures (RT or zone 1 REBOA). Outcomes were compared between patients who met the criteria (admission vital signs: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) ≥9 and systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) and those who did not. Subgroup analyses were then conducted on patients who had a REBOA placed and those who underwent RT. A total of 998 patients met our inclusion criteria. Of those, a REBOA was placed in 364 patients (37%), while 634 (64%) underwent RT. The overall mortality rate in the criteria (+) group was significantly lower than that in the criteria (-) group (62 vs. 79%, P < .001). In patients who survived beyond the emergency department following AO procedures, those who met the criteria underwent hemorrhage control procedures more frequently (83% vs. 57%, P < .001). Our data suggest that simple clinical criteria could guide the provider for proceeding with AO in patients with suspected NCTH."

    "abstract": "Incisional hernia is common after abdominal surgery. Watchful waiting carries the risk of incarceration and a need for emergency intervention. The aim of this study was to examine the risk of postoperative complications after emergency versus elective incisional hernia repair. Patients above 18 years of age undergoing open incisional hernia repair in Denmark in 2017-2018 were identified in the Danish Ventral Hernia Database. Patients were grouped according to elective or emergency hernia repair. The primary outcome was postoperative complications requiring operative intervention within 90 days, and the secondary outcome was postoperative length of stay. We included 1050 patients, of whom 882 were admitted for elective and 168 for emergency operation. Patients undergoing emergency repair were older (64.7 years vs 59.2 years, p < 0.001), more often smokers (25.8% vs 13.6%, p = 0.003), and more often had a Charlson comorbidity score ⩾2 (26.8% vs 19.2%, p = 0.005) compared to patients undergoing elective repair. In a multivariate regression analysis, emergency compared to elective operation (OR = 2.71, 95% CI = 1.4-5.25, p = 0.003) and retromuscular compared to onlay mesh placement (OR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.08-4.24, p = 0.013) were factors significantly associated with increased risk of postoperative complications. In a subgroup analysis including only emergency repairs, risk of complications after retromuscular mesh placement was even higher (OR = 10.12, 95% CI = 1.81-56.68, p = 0.008). Emergency incisional hernia repair was associated with increased risk of postoperative complications and this risk was accentuated with retromuscular mesh placement. The use of retromuscular mesh in the emergency setting should be avoided, and the abdominal wall could either be closed by sutures or additional onlay mesh."

    "abstract": "Recognizing dying patients is crucial to produce outcomes that are satisfactory to patients, their families, and clinicians. Earlier discussion of and shared decision-making around dying to improve these outcomes. In this study, we interviewed 16 senior clinicians to develop summaries of palliative care in 4 key specialties: Cardiology, Vascular Surgery, Emergency General Surgery, and Intensive Care. Oxford University Hospitals. Based on themes common to our 4 clinical areas, we developed a novel diagnostic framework to support shared palliative decision-making that can be summarized as follows: 1) Is the acute pathology reversible? 2) What is the patient's physiological reserve? 3) What is important to the patient? Will they be fit enough for discharge for a reasonable length of time? We believe that education using this framework in the medical school and postgraduate curricula would significantly improve recognition of dying patients. This would serve to stimulate earlier conversations, more shared decision-making, and ultimately better outcomes in palliative care and patient experience."

    "title": "Does the Emergency Surgery Score predict failure to discharge the patient home? A nationwide analysis.",
    "abstract": "The Emergency Surgery Score (ESS) is a point-based scoring system validated to predict mortality and morbidity in emergency general surgery (EGS). In addition to demographics and comorbidities, ESS accounts for the acuity of disease at presentation. We sought to examine whether ESS can predict the destination of discharge of EGS patients, as a proxy for quality of life at discharge. Using the 2007 to 2017 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database, we identified all EGS patients. EGS cases were defined as per American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program as those performed by a general surgeon within a short interval from diagnosis or the onset of related symptomatology, when the patient's well-being and outcome may be threatened by unnecessary delay and patient's status could deteriorate unpredictably or rapidly. Emergency Surgery Score patients were then categorized by their discharge disposition to home versus rehabilitation or nursing facilities. All patients with missing ESS or discharge disposition and those discharged to hospice, senior communities, or separate acute care facilities were excluded. Emergency Surgery Score was calculated for each patient. C statistics were used to study the correlation between ESS and the destination of discharge. Of 6,485,915 patients, 84,694 were included. The mean age was 57 years, 51% were female, and 79.6% were discharged home. The mean ESS was 5. Emergency Surgery Score accurately and reliably predicted the discharge destination with a C statistic of 0.83. For example, ESS of 1, 10, and 20 were associated with 0.9%, 56.5%, and 100% rates of discharge to a rehabilitation or nursing facility instead of home. Emergency Surgery Score accurately predicts which EGS patients require discharge to rehabilitation or nursing facilities and can thus be used for preoperatively counseling patients and families and for improving early discharge preparations, when appropriate.

    "abstract": "Timely access to emergency general surgery services, including trauma, is a critical aspect of patient care. This study looks to identify resource availability at small rural hospitals in order to improve the quality of surgical care. Forty-five nonteaching hospitals in West Virginia were divided into large community hospitals with multiple specialties (LCHs), small community hospitals with fewer specialties (SCHs), and critical access hospitals (CAHs). A 58-question survey on optimal resources for surgery was completed by 1 representative surgeon at each hospital. There were 8 LCHs, 18 SCHs, and 19 CAHs with survey response rates of 100%, 83%, and 89%, respectively. One hundred percent of hospitals surveyed had respiratory therapy and ventilator support, computerized tomography (CT) scanner and ultrasound, certified operating rooms, lab support, packed red blood cells (PRBC), and FFP accessible 24/7. Availability of cryoprecipitate, platelets, tranexamic acid (TXA), and prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) decreased from LCHs to CAHs. The majority had board-certified general surgeons; however, only 86% LCHs, 53% SCHs, and 50% CAHs had advanced trauma life support (ATLS) certification. One hundred percent of LCHs had operating room (OR) crew on call within 30 minutes, emergency cardiovascular equipment, critical care nursing, on-site pathologist, and biologic/synthetic mesh, whereas fewer SCHs and CAHs had these resources. One hundred percent of LCHs and SCHs had anesthesia availability 24/7 compared to 78% of CAHs. Improving access to the aforementioned resources is of utmost importance to patient outcomes. This will enhance rural surgical care and decrease emergency surgical transfers. Further education and research are necessary to support and improve rural trauma systems."

    "abstract": "Telemedicine has been shown to improve patient access to medical care while potentially improving overall healthcare efficiency. It has not been consistently explored on an acute care surgery service as a method of increasing clinic availability and efficiency within a safety-net hospital system. Socioeconomic hardships associated with an in-person clinic visit can deter patients with limited resources. A virtual clinic for post-operative laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients was developed. We hypothesized that a virtual follow-up increases clinic efficiency and availability for new patients without compromising patient safety. A retrospective review of patient and clinic outcomes before and after implementing virtual post-op visits for uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients on an acute care surgery service was performed. Providers called post-operative patients using a standardized questionnaire. Data included outpatient clinic composition (new vs. post-operative patients), elective operations scheduled, emergency department visits, and loss to follow-up rates. February to March 2017 was the baseline pre-intervention period, while February to March 2019 was post-intervention. Pre-intervention clinics consisted of 17% new and 50% post-op visits, in comparison to 31% new and 27% post-op visits in the post-intervention group (p < 0.01). Elective operations scheduled increased slightly from 8.4 to 11.5 per 100 patient visits, but was not statistically significant (p = 0.09). There was no change in the number of post-operative patients returning to the emergency department (p = 0.91) or loss to follow-up (p = 0.30) rates. Through the implementation of virtual post-operative visits for laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients, clinic efficiency improved by increasing new patient encounters, decreasing post-operative volume, and trending towards increased operations scheduled. This change did not compromise patient safety. Further implementation of telemedicine on an acute care surgery service is a promising method to expand services offered to an at-risk population and increase efficiency in a resource-limited environment."

    "abstract": "Optimal surgical care for older adults with life-threatening conditions, with high risk of poor perioperative outcomes and morality in the months after surgery, should incorporate an understanding of the patient's treatment goals and preferences. However, little research has explored the patient perspective of decision making and advanced care planning during an emergency surgery episode. We sought to better understand older patients' lived experience making decisions to undergo emergency general surgery (EGS) and perceptions of perioperative advance care planning (ACP). Adults aged 65 and older who underwent one of seven common EGS procedures with lengths of stay more than five days at three Boston-area hospitals were included. Semistructured phone interviews were conducted three months postdischarge. Transcripts were reviewed and coded independently by surgeons and palliative care physicians to identify themes. About 31 patients were interviewed. Patients viewed the decision for surgery as a choice of life over death and valued prolonging life. They felt there was no choice but to proceed with surgery but reported that participation in decision making was limited because of severe symptoms, time constraints, and confused thinking. Despite recently surviving a life-threatening illness, patients had not reconsidered their wishes for the future and preferred to avoid future ACP. Older patients who survived a life-threatening illness and EGS report receiving goal-concordant care in the moment that relieved symptoms and prolonged life but had not considered future care. Interventions to facilitate postoperative ACP should be targeted to this vulnerable group of older adults."

    "abstract": "The role of physician assistants (PAs) in surgical care in Canada is expanding. Similarly, the acute care surgery (ACS) model continues to evolve, and PAs are increasingly being considered as members of ACS teams. However, their exact impact and contribution has not been well studied. Our study describes the contribution of a PA who worked full time on weekdays on an ACS team in a Canadian academic tertiary hospital. To quantify the PA's contributions, an ACS database was created in September 2016. Data on the number of ACS patient encounters, the number of ACS surgical consults, the number of ACS admissions, the PA's involvement in the operating room, the number of PA patient encounters and the number of multidisciplinary meetings were prospectively collected. We report data for 365 consecutive days from Dec. 30, 2016, to Dec. 29, 2017. The ACS team had 11 651 patient encounters during the year, with a mean of 31.92 per day. The mean number of surgical consults per day was 5.89, and a mean of 2.08 surgical procedures were performed per day. The PA was involved in 53.5% of all patient encounters, despite working only during daytime hours on weekdays. Multidisciplinary meetings were conducted by the PA 94.9% of the time. Alternate level of care patients were seen by the PA 96.2% of the time. The PA was directly involved in 2.0% of the operating room procedures during the study period. Integrating a PA on an ACS team adds value to patient care by providing consistency and efficient management of ward issues and patient care plans, including multidisciplinary discharge planning, timely emergency department consultations and effective organization of the ACS team members. Les adjoints au médecin (AM) jouent un rôle croissant dans les soins chirurgicaux au Canada. Suivant la même tendance, le modèle de chirurgie en soins actifs (CSA) poursuit son évolution, et on considère de plus en plus les AM comme des membres des équipes de CSA. Cependant, les retombées de leur travail et leur contribution ont été peu étudiées, et de façon imprécise. Notre étude décrit la contribution d’un AM travaillant à temps plein, en semaine, au sein d’une équipe de CSA dans un centre hospitalier universitaire canadien de soins tertiaires. Afin de quantifier la contribution de l’AM, nous avons créé une base de données de CSA en septembre 2016. Nous avons collecté les données — nombre de rencontres avec des patients, de consultations et d’admissions de l’équipe; participation de l’AM au bloc opératoire; nombre de rencontres de l’AM avec des patients; nombre de réunions multidisciplinaires — de manière prospective. Nos données décrivent une période de 365 jours consécutifs, qui s’étale du 30 décembre 2016 au 29 décembre 2017. L’équipe de CSA a tenu 11 651 rencontres avec des patients dans l’année, pour une moyenne de 31,92 par jour. En moyenne, elle a réalisé 5,89 consultations et 2,08 interventions chirurgicales quotidiennement. L’AM a participé à 53,5 % des rencontres avec les patients, et ce malgré son horaire de jour et de semaine. L’AM a aussi dirigé 94,9 % des réunions multidisciplinaires, a vu 96,2 % des patients d’autres niveaux de soins, et a participé à 2,0 % des interventions au bloc opératoire. L’intégration d’un AM aux équipes de CSA est une valeur ajoutée pour les soins aux patients. Elle contribue à la gestion cohérente et efficace des événements au sein du service et des plans de soins, y compris la planification multidisciplinaire des congés, les consultations rapides à l’urgence et l’organisation efficace de l’équipe."

    "abstract": "There is an increasing trend toward regionalization of emergency general surgery, which burdens patients. The absence of a standardized, emergency general surgery transfer algorithm creates the potential for unnecessary transfers. The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical reasoning prompting emergency general surgery transfers and to initiate a discussion for optimal emergency general surgery use. Consecutive emergency general surgery transfers (December 2018 to May 2019) to 2 tertiary centers were prospectively enrolled in an institutional review board-approved protocol. Clinical reasoning prompting transfer was obtained prospectively from the accepting/consulting surgeon. Patient outcomes were used to create an algorithm for emergency general surgery transfer. Two hundred emergency general surgery transfers (49% admissions, 51% consults) occurred with a median age of 59 (18 to 100) and body mass index of 30 (15 to 75). Insurance status was 25% private, 45% Medicare, 21% Medicaid, and 9% uninsured. Weekend transfers (Friday to Sunday) occurred in 45%, and 57% occurred overnight (6:00 pm to 6:00 am). Surgeon-to-surgeon communication occurred with 22% of admissions. Pretransfer notification occurred with 10% of consults. Common transfer reasons included no surgical coverage (20%), surgeon discomfort (24%), or hospital limitations (36%). A minority (36%) underwent surgery within 24 hours; 54% did not require surgery during the admission. Median length of stay was 6 (1 to 44) days. Conditions prompting emergency general surgery transfers are heterogeneous in this rural state review. There remains an unmet need to standardize emergency general surgery transfer criteria, incorporating patient and hospital factors and surgeon availability. Well-defined requirements for communication with the accepting surgeon may prevent unnecessary transfers and maximize resource allocation."

    "abstract": "Most of the literature on emergency general surgery (EGS) has investigated appendiceal and biliary disease; however, EGS surgeons manage many other complex conditions. This study aimed to describe the operative burden of these conditions throughout Canada. This multicentre retrospective cohort study evaluated EGS patients at 7 centres across Canada in 2014. Adult patients (aged ≥ 18 yr) undergoing nonelective operative interventions for nonbiliary, nonappendiceal diseases were included. Data collected included information on patients' demographic characteristics, diagnosis, procedure details, complications and hospital length of stay. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of morbidity and mortality. A total of 2595 patients were included, with a median age of 60 years (interquartile range 46-73 yr). The most common principal diagnoses were small bowel obstruction (16%), hernia (15%), malignancy (11%) and perianal disease (9%). The most commonly performed procedures were bowel resection (30%), hernia repair (15%), adhesiolysis (11%) and débridement of skin and soft tissue infections (10%). A total of 47% of cases were completed overnight (between 5 pm and 8 am). The overall inhospital mortality rate was 8%. Thirty-three percent of patients had a complication, with independent predictors including increasing age (p = 0.001), increasing American Society of Anesthesiologists score (p = 0.02) and transfer from another centre (p = 0.001). This study characterizes the epidemiology of nonbiliary, nonappendiceal EGS operative interventions across Canada. Canadian surgeons are performing a large volume of EGS, and conditions treated by EGS services are associated with a substantial risk of morbidity and mortality. Results of this study will be used to guide future research efforts and set benchmarks for quality improvement. La plupart des études sur les services de chirurgie générale d’urgence (CGU) s’intéressent seulement aux atteintes de l’appendice et de la vésicule biliaire. Pourtant, les chirurgiens du domaine traitent beaucoup d’autres problèmes complexes. L’objectif de l’étude était de décrire le travail chirurgical associé à ces problèmes dans l’ensemble du Canada. Notre étude de cohorte rétrospective multicentrique inclut les patients adultes (≥ 18 ans) qui ont subi en 2014 une opération non planifiée pour une atteinte qui ne touchait ni l’appendice ni la vésicule biliaire dans 1 des 7 centres sélectionnés, répartis un peu partout au pays. Nous avons recueilli les données suivantes : renseignements de base des patients, diagnostic, détails de l’intervention, nature des complications et durée d’hospitalisation. Puis nous avons dégagé les facteurs prédictifs de morbidité et de mortalité en appliquant un modèle de régression logistique. L’échantillon totalisait 2595 patients, pour un âge médian de 60 ans (écart interquartile 46–73 ans). Les diagnostics principaux les plus courants étaient l’occlusion de l’intestin grêle (16 %), la hernie (15 %), la tumeur maligne (11 %) et les lésions périanales (9 %). Les interventions les plus fréquentes étaient la résection de l’intestin (30 %), la réparation d’une hernie (15 %), le débridement (11 %) et le débridement de tissus mous ou cutanés infectés (10 %). L’opération a eu lieu le soir ou la nuit (entre 17 h et 8 h) dans 47 % des cas. Le taux global de mortalité à l’hôpital était de 8 %. Des complications sont survenues chez 33 % des patients, dont les facteurs prédictifs indépendants étaient l’âge avancé (p = 0,001), un score ASA (de l’American Society of Anesthesiologists) élevé (p = 0,02) et le transfert à partir d’un autre centre (p = 0,001). Cette étude dresse le profil épidémiologique des interventions effectuées par les services de CGU du Canada en présence d’atteintes autres que celles de l’appendice et de la vésicule biliaire. Les chirurgiens du pays font beaucoup d’interventions générales urgentes, pour traiter des affections associées à un risque élevé de morbidité et de mortalité. Les résultats de l’étude guideront les prochaines recherches et serviront de points de référence en matière d’amélioration de la qualité."

    "abstract": "Acute Care Surgery (ACS) was developed as a structured, team-based approach to providing round-the-clock emergency general surgery (EGS) care for adult patients needing treatment for diseases such as cholecystitis, gastrointestinal perforation, and necrotizing fasciitis. Lacking any prior evidence on optimizing outcomes for EGS patients, current implementation of ACS models has been idiosyncratic. We sought to use a Donabedian approach to elucidate potential EGS structures and processes that might be associated with improved outcomes as an initial step in designing the optimal model of ACS care for EGS patients. We developed and implemented a national survey of hospital-level EGS structures and processes by surveying surgeons or chief medical officers regarding hospital-level structures and processes that directly or indirectly impacted EGS care delivery in 2015. These responses were then anonymously linked to 2015 data from the American Hospital Association (AHA) annual survey, Medicare Provider Analysis and Review claims (MedPAR), 17 State Inpatient Databases (SIDs) using AHA unique identifiers (AHAID). This allowed us to combine hospital-level data, as reported in our survey or to the AHA, to patient-level data in an effort to further examine the role of EGS structures and processes on EGS outcomes. We describe the multi-step, iterative process utilizing the Donabedian framework for quality measurement that serves as a foundation for later work in this project. Hospitals that responded to the survey were primarily non-governmental and located in urban settings. A plurality of respondent hospitals had fewer than 100 inpatient beds. A minority of the hospitals had medical school affiliations. Our results will enable us to develop a measure of preparedness for delivering EGS care in the US, provide guidance for regionalized care models for EGS care, tiering of ACS programs based on the robustness of their EGS structures and processes and the quality of their outcomes, and formulate triage guidelines based on patient risk factors and severity of EGS disease. Our work provides a template for team science applicable to research efforts combining primary data collection (i.e., that derived from our survey) with existing national data sources (i.e., SIDs and MedPAR)."

    "abstract": "Prior studies of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after emergency general surgery (EGS) are not nationally representative nor do they fully capture readmissions to different hospitals. We hypothesized that different-hospital readmission accounted for a significant number of readmissions with VTE after EGS and that predictive factors would be different for same- and different-hospital readmissions. The 2014 Nationwide Readmissions Database was queried for nonelective EGS hospitalizations. The outcomes were readmission to the index or different hospitals within 180 days with VTE. Multivariate logistic regressions identified risk factors for readmission to index and different hospitals with VTE, reported as odds ratios with their 95% confidence intervals. Patients were excluded if during the index admission they expired, developed a VTE, had a vena cava filter placed, or did not have at least 180 days of follow-up. Of 1,584,605 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 1.3% (n = 20,963) of patients were readmitted within 180 days with a VTE. Of these, 28% (n = 5,866) were readmitted to a different hospital. Predictors overall for readmission with VTE were malignancy, prolonged hospitalization, age, and being publicly insured. However, predictors for readmission to a different hospital are based on hospital characteristics, including for-profit status, or procedure type. Nearly one in three readmissions with VTE after EGS occurs at a different hospital and may be missed by current quality metrics that only capture same-hospital readmission. Such metrics may underestimate for-profit hospital postoperative VTE rates relative to public and nonprofit hospitals, potentially affecting benchmarking and reimbursement. Postdischarge VTE rate is associated with insurance status. These findings have implications for policy and prevention programming design. Epidemiological study, level III."

We were interested in the detailed information gain obtained from WBCT following standardized conventional imaging (CI). Prospective study including all emergency trauma centre patients examined by CI (focused assessment of sonography in trauma, chest and pelvic X-ray) followed by WBCT from 2011 to 2017. Radiology reports were compared per patient for defined body regions for number and severity of injuries (Abbreviated Injury Scale, AIS; Injury Severity Score, ISS), incidental findings and treatment consequences (Wilcoxon signed rank test, Spearman rho, Chi-square). 1271 trauma patients (ISS 11.3) were included in this study. WBCT detected more injury findings than CI in the equivalent body regions (1.8 vs. 0.6; p < 0.001). In 44.4% of cases at least one finding was missed by CI alone. Compared to WBCT, injury severity of specified body regions was underestimated by CI on average by an AIS of 1.9 (p < 0.001). In 22.0% of cases injury severity increased by an AIS ≥ 2 following WBCT. In 16.8% of patients additional injury findings resulted in a change of treatment (number needed to profit, NNP = 6 patients): NNP decreased from 25 for patients with an ISS < 7 up to nearly 2 for patients with an ISS > 25 at final evaluation, thereby demonstrating a significant improvement in the NNP with increasing ISS (rho = 0.33, p < 0.001). Moreover, WBCT in 88.4% of patients identified ≥ 1 incidental finding (mean 3.4) vs. 28.9% by CI only (p < 0.001). Overall, WBCT had treatment consequences in 31.9% of cases (NNP = 3.1). The application of WBCT in addition to CI in the emergency treatment of trauma had therapy consequences for almost every third patient. On the other hand, WBCT appeared not to be indicated (ISS < 8) in at least 2/5 of patients."

Emergent general surgery (EGS) intervention is often warranted but remains poorly described. We reviewed EGS consultations in LVAD patients to better understand these patients. During a 12-year period, 301 LVAD patients were reviewed. Demographics, comorbidities, reason for EGS consultation, operative intervention, transplantation, and mortality were analyzed. Wilcoxon, Fisher's exact, and chi-square tests were used for analysis. Statistical significance was P < .05. A total of 139 (46.2%) patients required EGS consultation. EGS consultations were older (63 vs 57 years; P = .002), primarily Caucasian (86%), and male (83%) with average preimplant cardiac index of 1.84. Comorbidities were similar between those with and without EGS consultation. Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding was the most common reason for consultation (53%), followed by abdominal pain (22%) and bowel ischemia/obstruction (19%). Of EGS consultations, 77% were on warfarin and 60% on aspirin. Procedures were not withheld: 46% required esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and 30% required colonoscopy. Surgical intervention was performed in 28% of EGS consults-49% emergent (within 24 hours) and 44% urgent (during hospitalization). Mean time to surgery was 48 days after LVAD placement. EGS intervention precluded 7 (18%) patients from heart transplantation and 10 (26%) patients suffered perioperative mortality. Elevated lactic acid was associated with increased mortality. EGS consultation is necessary in almost half of all LVAD patients, most commonly for GI bleed. EGD/colonoscopy can be safely used to manage the majority of these consultations; one-third will require surgery. High lactic acid is associated with higher mortality. Additional analysis of this population is required for improving surgical management."

    "abstract": "The number of non-cardiac major surgeries carried out has significantly increased in recent years to around 200 million procedures carried out annually. Approximately 30% of patients submitted to non-cardiac surgery present some form of cardiovascular comorbidity. In emergency situations, with less surgery planning time and greater clinical severity, the risks become even more significant. The aim of this study is to determine the incidence and clinical outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease submitted to non-cardiac surgical procedures in a single cardiovascular referral center. This is a prospective cohort study of patients with cardiovascular disease submitted to non-cardiovascular surgery. All procedures were carried out by the same surgeon, between January 2006 and January 2018. 240 patients included were elderly, 154 were male (64%), 8 patients presented two diagnoses. Of the resulting 248 procedures carried out, 230 were emergency (92.8%). From the data obtained it was possible to estimate the day from which the occurrence of mortality is less probable in the postoperative phase. Our research evaluated the epidemiological profile of the surgeries and we were able to estimate the survival and delimit the period of greatest risk of mortality in these patients. The high rate of acute mesenteric ischemia was notable, a serious and frequently fatal condition."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) conditions encompass a variety of diseases treated by acute care surgeons. The heterogeneity of these diseases limits infrastructure to facilitate EGS-specific quality improvement (QI) and research. A uniform anatomic severity grading system for EGS conditions was recently developed to fill this need. We integrated this system into our clinical workflow and examined its impact on research, surgical training, communication, and patient care. The grading system was integrated into our clinical workflow in a phased fashion through formal education and a written handbook. A documentation template was also deployed in our electronic medical record to prospectively assign severity scores at the time of patient evaluation. Mixed methods including a quantitative survey and qualitative interviews of trainees and attending surgeons were used to evaluate the impact of the new workflow and to identify obstacles to its adoption. We identified 2291 patients presenting with EGS conditions during our study period. The most common diagnoses were small bowel obstruction (n=470, 20.5%), acute cholecystitis (n=384, 16.8%), and appendicitis (n=370, 16.1%). A total of 21 qualitative interviews were conducted. Twenty interviewees (95.2%) had a positive impression of the clinical workflow, citing enhanced patient care and research opportunities. Fifteen interviewees (75.0%) reported the severity grading system was a useful framework for clinical management, with five participants (25.0%) indicating the system was useful to facilitate clinical communication. Participants identified solutions to overcome barriers to adoption of the clinical workflow. The uniform anatomic severity grading system can be readily integrated into a clinical workflow to facilitate prospective data collection for QI and research. The system is perceived as valuable by users. Educational initiatives that focus on increasing familiarity with the system and its benefits will likely improve adoption of the classification system and the clinical workflow that uses it.

    "abstract": "The New Zealand Government announced a four-level COVID-19 alert system soon after the first confirmed case in the country. New Zealand moved swiftly to the highest alert level 4, described as lockdown, as the epidemic curve quickly accelerated. Auckland City Hospital saw a temporary change in acute surgical admissions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of the national lockdown on emergency general surgery. A retrospective analysis was performed of all patients admitted to Auckland City Hospital via the Acute Surgical Unit during lockdown from 26 March to 27 April 2020. A comparison group was collected from the 33 days prior to lockdown, 22 February to 25 March 2020. The number of admissions decreased by 26% (P-value 0.000). A 56.8% decrease in patients presenting with trauma was found (P-value 0.002). After exclusion of trauma patients, no statistical difference in discharge diagnosis was found. There was a 43.6% reduction in operations performed (P-value 0.037). There was a difference found in the management of appendicitis and cholecystitis (P-value 0.003). Median length of stay was decreased from 1.8 to 1.3 days (P-value 0.031). Auckland City Hospital had a decrease in admissions and operations during the COVID-19 lockdown. These findings suggest people with serious pathology were staying at home untreated or being treated in the community. This is a snapshot of our experience in managing emergency general surgical patients in this unusual period."

    "abstract": "Nonoperative management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) results in resolution for the majority of patients. Previous studies have demonstrated that outcomes for patients with ASBO are improved when patients are admitted to a surgical service, but the effect of general surgery resident coverage is unclear. This study measures quality outcomes for patients with ASBO after the establishment of a new general surgery residency program. An institutional review board-approved retrospective chart review of admissions for ASBO was conducted following the implementation of a protocol for ASBO nested within a newly developed resident-run emergency general surgery (EGS) service. Patients successfully treated without operative intervention were analyzed. During the study period, 612 patients were admitted for ASBO. After initiation of the residency, 74% of ASBO were admitted to a surgical service compared with 35% prior to residency (P < .01). Length of stay was reduced by 0.77 days (P = .016), average direct total cost per patient was reduced by 24% (P = .002), and 30-day readmissions were reduced by 35.7% (P = .046). There was no significant difference in mortality (1.4% vs 1.0%). Admission to a resident-run surgical service was associated with statistically significant improvement in outcomes for patients with ASBO. These data corroborate prior studies demonstrating the positive impact of residency programs on patient outcomes and provide additional evidence that general surgery residency programs improve outcomes for patients with surgical disease."

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to changes in NHS surgical service provision, including reduced elective surgical and endoscopic activity, with only essential emergency surgery being undertaken. This, combined with the government-imposed lockdown, may have impacted on patient attendance, severity of surgical disease, and outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible 'lockdown' effect on the volume and severity of surgical admissions and their outcomes. Two separate cohorts of adult emergency general surgery inpatient admissions 30 days immediately before (February 16, 2020 to March 15, 2020), and after UK government advice (March 16, 2020 to April 15, 2020). Data were collected relating to patient characteristics, severity of disease, clinical outcomes, and compared between these groups. Following lockdown, a significant reduction in median daily admissions from 7 to 3 per day (p < 0.001) was observed. Post-lockdown patients were significantly older, frailer with higher inflammatory indices and rates of acute kidney injury, and also were significantly more likely to present with gastrointestinal cancer, obstruction, and perforation. Patients had significantly higher rates of Clavien-Dindo Grade ≥3 complications (p = 0.001), all cause 30-day mortality (8.5% vs. 2.9%, p = 0.028), but no significant difference was observed in operative 30-day mortality. There appears to be a \"lockdown\" effect on general surgical admissions with a profound impact; fewer surgical admissions, more acutely unwell surgical patients, and an increase in all cause 30-day mortality. Patients should be advised to present promptly with gastrointestinal symptoms, and this should be reinforced for future lockdowns during the pandemic."

Information on the burden of EGS is critical for developing strategies to improve the outcomes. In this retrospective cohort study, medical records of all general surgical operations in a public hospital were reviewed for the period 1st January 2017 to 31st December 2017. Data on patient demographics, operative workload, case mix, time of surgery and outcomes were analysed. Of the 2960 general surgical operations that were performed in 2017, 1720 (58.1%) of the procedures were performed as emergencies. The mean age for the patients undergoing emergency general surgical procedures was 37.9 years (Standard Deviation, ±21.0), with male preponderance (57.5%). Appendicitis was the most frequent diagnosis for the emergency procedures (43%) followed by infections of the skin and soft tissues (31.6%). Disorders of the colon and rectum ranked as the third most common condition, accounting for 6.7% of the emergency procedures. Majority of emergency surgery (59.3%) took place after office hours and on weekends. Post-operative deaths and admissions to critical care facilities increased during EGS when compared to elective surgery, p<0.01. EGS constitutes a major part of the workload of general surgeons and it is associated significant risk for death and post-operative complications. The burden of EGS must be recognised and patient care systems must evolve to make surgery safe and efficient."

The Multiple Consultant Report (MCR) is new and has been developed as the main assessment tool for this outcomes-based curriculum. Assessment in the MCR will be on progress from the ability to only observe at the start of training, to performance at the level of Day-1 consultant in the complex, integrated skills needed for the day-to-day performance of the role in each of the areas of the job (the Capabilities in Practice). The MCR and trainee self assessment will improve feedback and allow specific and bespoke agreed learning objectives to be more easily developed and delivered, and faster but safe training for many.

We aim to determine if surgeon affiliation with top US universities/hospitals (TOPS) is associated with increased research productivity measured by numbers of peer-reviewed publications in PubMed (PMIDs). A bibliometric analysis was performed for PMIDs. Affiliated authors who published in trauma surgery (TS), surgical critical care (SCC), acute care surgery (ACS), and emergency general surgery (EGS) were evaluated for publications between 2015 and 2019, and lifetime productivity. Our analysis included 3443 authors from 443 different institutions. Our main outcome was PMIDs of first author (FA) and senior author (SA) in each field (2015-2019) and total lifetime publications. Significant differences exist between PMIDs from TOPS vs non-TOPS in FA-TS (1.34 vs 1.23, P = .001), SA-TS (1.71 vs 1.46, P < .001), total SA-PMIDs (44.10 vs 26.61, P < .001), and SA-lifetime PMIDs (90.55 vs 59.03, P < .001). There were no significant differences in PMIDs for FA or SA-SCC, FA or SA-ACS, FA or SA-EGS, FA-total PMIDs 2015-2019, or FA-lifetime PMIDs (P > .05 for all). There were significantly higher TS PMIDs among FAs and SAs affiliated with top US institutions in 2015-2019, along with higher total PMIDs (2015-2019) and lifetime PMIDs.

Understanding the types of nonelective EGDs performed by ACS groups is important for the development of ACS programs and the training of future general surgeons. Methods. We conducted a retrospective review of all EGDs performed by ACS surgeons at a single urban academic center over a 5-year period (January 2013-December 2018). Results. A total of 495 EGDs were performed, of which 129 (26%) were urgent, nonelective procedures. Patients who underwent urgent EGD were younger than those who underwent elective procedures (median 55 vs 60 years, P = .03), had higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classes (median ASA 3 vs 2, P = .0002), and longer hospital stays (median 5 days vs 0 days, P < .0001). The most common indications for urgent endoscopies were the management of leak, dysphagia, or stenosis in patients with a history of foregut surgery, followed by the management of esophageal perforation. The success rate of endoscopic therapy was high (median 88%, interquartile range (IQR) 78-89%). However, some patients required multiple interventions (median 1, IQR 1-3), and patients treated for leaks were less likely to be successfully treated with endoscopic therapy alone than patients treated for other indications (success rate 65% vs 88%, P = .003). Conclusions. Our experience suggests that EGD has an important role in current ACS practice and that endoscopic management is safe and effective in a range of urgent surgical scenarios. Future ACS surgeons should be facile with endoscopic techniques."

    "abstract": "Gallbladder disease frequently requires emergency general surgery (EGS). The Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandated health insurance coverage for all with the intent to improve access to care and decrease morbidity, mortality, and costs. We hypothesize that after the ACA open-enrollment in 2014 the number of EGS cholecystectomies decreased as access to care improved with a shift in EGS cholecystectomies to teaching institutions. A retrospective review of the National Inpatient Sample Database from 2012 to quarter 3 of 2015 was performed. Patients age 18-64, with a nonelective admission for gallbladder disease based on ICD-9 codes, were collected. Outcomes measured included cholecystectomy, complications, mortality, and wage index-adjusted costs. The effect of the ACA was determined by comparing preACA to postACA years. 189,023 patients were identified. In the postACA period the payer distribution for admissions decreased for Self-pay (19.3% to 13.6%, P < 0.001), Medicaid increased (26.3% to 34.0%, P < 0.001) and Private insurance was unchanged (48.6% to 48.7%, P = 0.946). PostACA, admissions to teaching hospitals increased across all payer types, EGS cholecystectomies decreased, while complications increased, and mortality was unchanged. Median costs increased significantly for Medicaid and Private insurance while Self-pay was unchanged. Based on adjusted DID analyses for Insured compared to Self-pay patients, EGS cholecystectomies decreased (-2.7% versus -1.21%, P = 0.033) and median cost increased more rapidly (+$625 versus +$166, P = 0.017). The ACA has changed EGS, shifting the majority of patients to teaching institutions despite insurance type and decreasing the need for EGS cholecystectomy.

This study examined outcomes after colorectal resection in emergency general surgery patients. This was an Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma-sponsored prospective observational multicenter study of patients undergoing urgent/emergent colorectal resection. Twenty-one centers enrolled patients for 11 months. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were recorded. χ, Mann-Whitney U test, and multivariable logistic regression models were used to describe outcomes and risk factors for surgical complication/mortality. A total of 439 patients were enrolled (ANST, 184; STM, 255). The median (interquartile range) age was 62 (53-71) years, and the median Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was 4 (1-6). The most common indication for surgery was diverticulitis (28%). Stoma group was older (64 vs. 58 years, p < 0.001), had a higher CCI, and were more likely to be immunosuppressed. Preoperatively, STM patients were more likely to be intubated (57 vs. 15, p < 0.001), on vasopressors (61 vs. 13, p < 0.001), have pneumoperitoneum (131 vs. 41, p < 0.001) or fecal contamination (114 vs. 33, p < 0.001), and had a higher incidence of elevated lactate (149 vs. 67, p < 0.001). Overall mortality was 13%, which was higher in STM patients (18% vs. 8%, p = 0.02). Surgical complications were more common in STM patients (35% vs. 25%, p = 0.02). On multivariable analysis, management with an open abdomen, intraoperative blood transfusion, and larger hospital size were associated with development of a surgical complication, while CCI, preoperative vasopressor use, steroid use, open abdomen, and intraoperative blood transfusion were independently associated with mortality. This study highlights a tendency to perform fecal diversion in patients who are acutely ill at presentation. There is a higher morbidity and mortality rate in STM patients. Independent predictors of mortality include CCI, preoperative vasopressor use, steroid use, open abdomen, and intraoperative blood transfusion. Following adjustment by clinical factors, method of colon management was not associated with surgical complications or mortality. Therapeutic study, level IV."

An EGS-specific quality program was created with service-based Advanced Practice Provider (SB APP) administrative oversight, thus validating the need for a dedicated EGS program manager. In 2017, a quality structure was formalized with primary focus on scheduled quality meetings, peer review and outcomes review. All admission, service-specific dashboards, and readmission data were manually audited by SB APPs to confirm accuracy and identify opportunities for process improvement. Surgical quality metrics including patient volume, mortality, complications, readmission and infection prevention indicators, were reviewed by SBAPPs. Annual EMR data for all EGS patients was compared to data collected via manual review with a novel registry logic. Comparison of EMR generated data versus EGS registry data identified under-representation of total admissions: in 2016, the EMR identified 130 admissions with registry logic identifying 625 actual EGS admissions. The EMR identified 515 admissions in 2017 and 485 admission in 2018 with registry logic identifying 777 and 712, respectively. Review of readmission data revealed an error of 14 patients in 2017 and 11 patients in 2018. The quest to improve quality of care for the EGS patient requires timely review of high-quality, accurate data by dedicated and trained personnel.

This paper reports the outcomes of a Consultant-delivered service model for weekend admissions and its impact for patients undergoing emergency laparotomy. Operative data was analysed from a prospectively collected database over 5-years. Primary outcome measures were 30-day all-cause mortality and Clavien-Dindo class ≥2 morbidity. Secondary outcomes included time from admission to diagnostic imaging and time to surgery, post-operative length of stay and requirement for Intensive Care Unit admission. 263 patients underwent an emergency laparotomy. Overall 30-day mortality was 4.6% and all-cause morbidity was 55.9%. The most common indications for laparotomy were mechanical small bowel obstruction (32.7%) and hollow viscus perforation (30.4%) of the 263 emergency laparotomies, 92 patients in the cohort were weekend admissions (Saturday or Sunday). There was no significant difference amongst patients admitted during the weekend in ASA grade, age, gender, or proportion of patients receiving a pre-operative computed tomography scan, when compared to those during the week. Compared to weekdays, weekend admission was not associated with a significant difference in mortality (5.3% and 3.3%, respectively p = 0.458), all-cause morbidity (p = 0.509), post-operative length of stay (p = 0.681), or Intensive Care Unit admission (p = 0.761).

Patients leaving the hospital against medical advice (AMA) have a greater risk for readmission and complications. We sought to identify clinical and demographic characteristics along with hospital factors associated with leaving AMA after EGS operations. A retrospective review of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample was performed. All patients who underwent an EGS procedure accounting for >80% of the burden of EGS-related inpatient resources were identified. 4:1 propensity score analysis was conducted. Regression analyses determined predictive factors for leaving AMA. 546,856 patients were identified. 1085 (0.2%) patients who underwent EGS left AMA.

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) has high rates of morbidity, mortality, and readmission. Therefore, it might be expected that an EGS service fields many consultations for postoperative patients. However, with the known overutilization of emergency department visits for nonurgent conditions, we hypothesized most postoperative consults received by an EGS service would be nonurgent and could be appropriately managed as an outpatient. We reviewed all EGS consults at a single urban safety net hospital over a 12-month period, screening for patients who had undergone surgery in the previous 12 mo. This included consultations from the emergency room and inpatient setting. Demographics, admission status, procedures performed, and other details were abstracted from the chart and Vizient reports. Consultation questions were categorized and then reviewed by an expert panel to determine if conditions could have been managed as an outpatient. The EGS service received a total of 1112 consults, with 99 (9%) for a postoperative condition. Overall, 85% of postoperative consults were admitted after consultation, 19% underwent surgery and 21% underwent a procedure with gastroenterology or interventional radiology. Expert review classified slightly over one-third (36%) of consults as nonurgent. Most postoperative consults seen at our urban safety net hospital represent true morbidity that required admission, intervention, or surgery. Despite this high acuity, one-third of postoperative consults could have been managed as an outpatient. Efforts to improve discharge instructions and set patient expectations could limit unnecessary postoperative emergency department visits."

A retrospective review of a prospectively collected emergency general surgery registry of patients admitted to a tertiary-care, academic center with the diagnosis of SP who underwent an intervention was performed (2010-2018). Patients were divided into successful drainage (SD), drainage failure (DF), and surgery first (SF) groups. DF was defined as the need for surgical intervention. The study included 129 patients. Fifty (38.8%) patients underwent SF as their initial management modality. Among 79 patients who underwent drainage, 34 (43.0%) were in the DF group and progressed to surgical intervention. Within that group, 19 (55.9%) underwent open necrosectomy. The DF group was more likely to have lower rates of peripancreatic fluid collections, a higher rate of necrotizing pancreatitis, and a higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score when compared with the DS group. Mortality was higher in the DF and SF groups, and total length of stay and ICU length of stay were highest in the DF group. Patients who experience failure of drainage for SP have high morbidity and mortality rates and fare worse overall than patients who undergo surgery as the primary intervention. Patients with necrotizing pancreatitis and a higher APACHE II score might warrant surgical intervention over a drainage-first approach."

We determined predictors of mortality after emergency general surgery for patients with HM using national-level data. We analyzed the 2010-2014 National Inpatient Sample for International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes for HM and abdominal operations, comparing adult patient encounters with abdominal operations with HM to those without HM. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of mortality. Of the 7.9 million adult inpatient encounters where abdominal surgery was performed, 82,187 (1%) had concomitant diagnoses of HM. Mortality among patient encounters with HM was significantly higher than without HM (9.0% versus 2.0%; P < 0.0001). Patient encounters with HM and surgery and a diagnosis of acute abdominal pain had mortality rates as high as 41%. The median standardized risk ratio for death after the top 25 general surgery procedures was 2.9 (interquartile range: 2.2-3.8) among patients with HM. In adjusted analyses, odds of mortality among patients with HM undergoing surgery were increased by concomitant acute abdominal pain diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] = 2.6; P < 0.0001), coagulopathy (OR = 2.0; P < 0.0001), aplastic anemia (OR = 1.7; P < 0.0001), peripheral vascular disease (OR = 1.4; P = 0.001), and weight loss (OR = 1.3; P < 0.0001). Although uncommon, surgery on patients with HM is associated with mortality rates nearly five times higher than the general surgical population. Patients with HM requiring surgical intervention may be at particularly high odds of death and postoperative complications."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) is a field characterized by disproportionately high costs, post-operative mortality, and complications. We attempted to identify independent factors predictive of an increased postoperative length of stay (LOS), a key contributor to economic burden and worse outcomes. The ACS-NSQIP database was queried for data from2005 to 2017. Current procedural terminology (CPT) codes were used to identify the most commonly performed EGS procedures: appendectomy, bowel resection, colectomy, and cholecystectomy. Cohorts above and below 75th percentile LOS were determined, compared by preoperative variables, and evaluated with univariate and multivariate logistic regression to quantify risk. Of 267,495 cases, 70,703 cases were above the 75th percentile for LOS. A larger proportion of patients in the extended LOS group were 41 years or older (88.6% vs 45.7%). More Blacks (10.3% vs 6.7%) were observed in the extended LOS group. Age, race, cardiopulmonary, hepatic, and renal disease, diabetes, recent weight loss, steroid use, and sepsis history were significant factors on multivariate analysis but varied in terms of risk proportion by procedure. Age (61+), Black race, hypertension, sepsis, and cancer were significant for all 4 procedures. Several factors are independently associated with extended LOS for those undergoing the most common EGS procedures. Five of these were associated with an increased LOS for all four procedures. These included, age (61+), hypertension, sepsis, cancer, and Black race."

    "abstract": "The impact of socioeconomic deprivation and comorbidities on the outcome of patients who require emergency general surgery (EGS) admission is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of deprivation and comorbidity on mortality, discharge destination and length of hospital stay (LOS) in patients undergoing EGS in Scotland. Prospectively collected data from all Scottish adult patients (aged >15 years) requiring EGS admitted between 1997 and 2016 were obtained from the Scottish Government. Data included age, sex, Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD), 5-year Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), whether an operation took place and outcomes including mortality, discharge destination and LOS. Logistic regression was used for the analysis of mortality and discharge destination and Poisson regression was used for LOS. 1 477 810 EGS admissions were analyzed. 16.2% were in the most deprived SIMD decile and 5.6% in the least deprived SIMD decile. 75.6% had no comorbidity, 20.3% had mild comorbidity, 2.5% had moderate comorbidity and 1.6% had severe comorbidity. 78.6% were discharged directly home. Inpatient, 30-day, 90-day and 1-year crude mortality was 1.7%, 3.7%, 7.2% and 12.4%, respectively. Logistic regression showed that severe comorbidity was associated with not being discharged directly to home (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.39) and higher inpatient mortality (OR 13.74, 95% CI 13.09 to 14.42). Compared with the most affluent population, the most deprived population were less likely to be discharged directly to home (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95 to 0.99) and had higher inpatient mortality (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.8 to 1.46). Poisson analysis showed that severe comorbidity (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.68 to 1.69) and socioeconomic deprivation (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.12) were associated with longer LOS. Increased levels of comorbidity and, to a lesser extent, socioeconomic deprivation are key drivers of mortality, discharge destination and LOS following admission to an EGS service.

    "abstract": "Several composite measures of neighborhood social vulnerability exist and are used in the health disparity literature. This study assesses the performance of the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) compared with three similar measures used in the surgical literature: Area Deprivation Index (ADI), Community Needs Index (CNI), and Distressed Communities Index (DCI). There are advantages of the SVI over these other scales, and we hypothesize that it performs equivalently. We identified all cholecystectomies at a single, urban, academic hospital over a 9-month period. Cases were considered emergency if the patient presented and underwent surgery during that admission. We geocoded patient's addresses and assigned estimated SVI, ADI, CNI, and DCI. Cutoffs for high versus low social vulnerability were generated using Youden's index, and the scales were compared using multivariable modeling. Overall, 366 patients met inclusion criteria, and the majority (n = 266, 73%) had surgery in the emergency setting. On multivariable modeling, patients with high social vulnerability were more likely to undergo emergency surgery compared with those with low social vulnerability in accordance with all four scales: SVI (OR 3.24, P < 0.001), ADI (OR 3.2, P < 0.001), CNI (OR 1.90, P = 0.04), and DCI (OR 2.01, P = 0.03). The scales all had comparable predictive value. The SVI performs similarly to other indices of neighborhood vulnerability in demonstrating disparities between emergency and elective surgery and is readily available and updated. Because the SVI has multiple subcategories in addition to the overall measure, it can be used to stratify by modifiable factors such as housing or transportation to inform interventions."

    "abstract": "We examined differences in critical care structures and processes between hospitals with Acute Care Surgery (ACS) versus general surgeon on call (GSOC) models for emergency general surgery (EGS) care. 2811 EGS-capable hospitals were surveyed to examine structures and processes including critical care domains and ACS implementation. Differences between ACS and GSOC hospitals were compared using appropriate tests of association and logistic regression models. 272/1497 hospitals eligible for analysis (18.2%) reported they use an ACS model. EGS patients at ACS hospitals were more likely to be admitted to a combined trauma/surgical ICU or a dedicated surgical ICU. GSOC hospitals had lower adjusted odds of having 24-h ICU coverage, in-house intensivists or respiratory therapists, and 4/6 critical-care protocols. Critical care delivery is a key component of EGS care. While harnessing of critical care structures and processes varies across hospitals that have implemented ACS, overall ACS models of care appear to have more robust critical care practices."

At our institution, trauma and acute care surgery guidelines have historically been published using a paper-based format. Mobile application-based guidelines were developed to address the shortcomings of paper-based guidelines. We assessed the utility, usability, and satisfaction of healthcare providers towards paper-based versus mobile application-based guidelines. A survey was administered to providers within the emergency department and intensive care unit. Fifty of 137 providers responded (36.5% response rate). Nearly half (47.4%, 9 of 19) of those who received a copy of the paper-based guidelines lost the guidelines at least once. Regarding usage of the mobile application-based guidelines, 92.6% (25 of 27) were aware of the application; 92.6% (25 of 27) considered the application comprehensive, 85.2% (23 of 27) thought the application was organized, and 66.7% (18 of 27) thought the application was easy to use. Additionally, 88.9% (24 of 27) found the application moderately, very, or extremely helpful and 85.2% (23 of 27) judged the application moderately, very, or extremely necessary. Overall, 88.9% (24 of 27) were satisfied with the application and indicated likeliness to recommend to a colleague. Seventeen of 27 (63.0%) agreed or strongly agreed that the application improved their provision of trauma and acute care. This survey demonstrates positive usability, utility, and satisfaction among trauma healthcare providers with the mobile application-based guidelines. Additionally, this quality improvement initiative highlights the importance of having comprehensive, organized, and easy-to-use trauma and acute care surgery guidelines and targeted educational materials available on demand. The successful transition from paper to mobile application-based guidelines serves as a model for other institutions to modernize and improve patient care and provider education. IV."

Emergency general surgery (EGS) patients comprise 7% of hospital admissions in America with a reported rate of VTE of 2.5%. Of these, >69% required hospital readmission, making VTE the second most common cause for readmission after infection in EGS patients. We hypothesize a correlation between body mass index (BMI) and VTE in EGS patients. The American College of Surgeons National Surgery Quality Improvement Database (NSQIP) was queried from January 2015 to December 2016. 83 272 patients met inclusion criteria: age ≥18 and underwent an EGS procedure. Patients were stratified by BMI. Descriptive statistics were used for demographic and numerical data. Categorical comparisons between covariates were completed using the chi-square test. Continuous variables were compared using Student's t-test, Mann Whitney U-test, or Kruskal-Wallis H test. 83 272 patients met the inclusion criteria. 1358 patients developed VTE (903 deep vein thrombosis (DVT) only, 335 pulmonary embolism (PE) only, and 120 with DVT and PE). Morbidly obese patients were 1.7 times more likely to be diagnosed with a PE compared with normal BMI (P = .004). Increased BMI was associated with the co-diagnosis of PE and DVT (P = .027). Patients with BMI <18.5 were 1.4 times more likely to experience a VTE compared with normal BMI (P = .018). Patients with a VTE were 3.2 times more likely to die (P < .001) and less likely to be discharged home (P < .001). Our study found that obese and underweight EGS patients had an increased incidence of VTE. Risk recognition and chemoprophylaxis may improve outcomes in this population."

    "abstract": "Most remote areas have restricted access to healthcare services and are too small and remote to sustain specialist services. In 2017, the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) published guidelines for the management of intra-abdominal infections. Many hospitals, especially those in remote areas, continue to face logistical barriers, leading to an overall poorer adherence to international guidelines. The aim of this paper is to report and amend the 2017 WSES guidelines for the management of intra-abdominal infections, extending these recommendations for remote areas and low-income countries. A literature search of the PubMed/MEDLINE databases was conducted covering the period up until June 2020. The critical shortages of healthcare workers and material resources in remote areas require the use of a robust triage system. A combination of abdominal signs and symptoms with early warning signs may be used to screen patients needing immediate acute care surgery. A tailored diagnostic step-up approach based on the hospital's resources is recommended. Ultrasound and plain X-ray may be useful diagnostic tools in remote areas. The source of infection should be totally controlled as soon as possible. The cornerstones of effective treatment for intra-abdominal infections in remote areas include early diagnosis, prompt resuscitation, early source control, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Standardization in applying the guidelines is mandatory to adequately manage intra-abdominal infections."

EGS patients were identified in the NSQIP 2011-2016 database. Outcome variables included interhospital transfer, days to surgery, SSI, postoperative LOS, discharge destination, and 30-day readmission. Descriptive statistics and multivariable regression were utilized. 419,373 EGS patients were identified, and transfer status varied by obesity class. After controlling for other factors, obese patients had increased odds of interhospital transfer (OR = 1.07-1.53), SSI (OR = 1.22-1.69), and decreased odds of discharge to home (OR = 0.42-0.71, all p < 0.01) but not of 30-day readmission or delay from admission to surgical intervention. Obese patients undergoing EGS procedures have an increased likelihood of transfer from an acute care hospital. As obese EGS patients are increasingly prevalent, determining best triage practices for this unique patient population warrants additional investigation."

A total of 25 (78.1%) of the 32 active surgical departments in Israel complied with the study. During the time frame of the study 1699 patients were admitted from the emergency departments of which 538 patients required surgical interventions. Only 16% of the hospitals in Israel have dedicated operating rooms, but 96% needed to cancel elective cases for emergency interventions during the morning hours; 51 (9.5%) elective cases were cancelled.

Studies have not specifically evaluated patients with acute cholecystitis. We sought to assess whether use of indocyanine green can decrease the rate of bail-out operation (subtotal cholecystectomy or conversion to an open operation) in an acute care surgery population where acute cholecystitis is more frequent. Using a retrospective cohort design, we examined all inpatient cholecystectomies performed by the acute care surgery service under urgent or semiurgent (biliary colic as the presentation in the emergency room) conditions at a single institution from 7/1/18 to 6/30/19 during which indocyanine green was available for use at the surgeon's discretion. A total of 198 patients were included in the analysis. Demographic variables were similar in groups receiving indocyanine green versus not. Pathology confirmed acute cholecystitis was present in 96 of 198 (48.5%) patients; of those, 55 (57.2%) received indocyanine green. Indocyanine green did not change the rate of bail-out operation between patients who received indocyanine green and those who did not (6.7% vs 4.3%, P = .468). No significant differences in complications were observed. Bail-out operation was more likely in cases of acute cholecystitis (9.4%) versus nonacute cholecystitis (2.0%) (odds ratio = 5.172, P = .039). In patients with acute cholecystitis, indocyanine green did not change the rate of bail-out operation (indocyanine green: 12.7% vs no indocyanine green: 4.9%, P = .293). This is the first series looking at the use of indocyanine green specifically in an acute care surgery population. Indocyanine green did not decrease operative time or need for a bail-out operation in acute cholecystitis. Further study is needed to determine whether indocyanine green use is justified in this population."

A systematic review of literature review and metanalysis was conducted. All studies comparing drain versus no drain after LC for acute cholecystitis were included. Seven studies, with 1274 patients, were included. Postoperative wound infection rates (relative risk (RR) 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.10 to 0.88; I2 = 0%) and postoperative abdominal collection requiring drainage (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.12; I 2 = 0%) were lower in the no-drain group, but this was only significant for wounded infections on subgroup analysis of RCTs. Length of stay hospital (mean difference (MD) -0.49, 95% CI -0.89 to -0.09; I 2 = 69%) and operative time (MD -8.13, 95% CI -13.87 to -2.38; I 2 = 92%) were significantly shorter in the no drain group however this was in the context of significant heterogeneity. The available data suggests that acute cholecystitis is not an indication for routine drain placement after LC. However, these results must be interpreted with caution due to the limitations of the included studies. In effect, the main issue of this meta-analysis lies on the limitations of the included studies themselves, because of a considerable heterogeneity among the included works, particularly for the inclusion criteria of patients and reported severity of acute cholecystitis.

A retrospective chart review was performed on patients with NSTIs from 2012 to 2018. Patient baseline characteristics, microbiologic data, antimicrobial therapy, and clinical outcomes were collected. Patients were excluded if they had comfort care before excision. The primary outcome measured was in-hospital mortality. A total of 215 patients met study criteria with a fungal species identified in 29 patients (13.5%). The most prevalent fungal organism was Candida tropicalis (n = 11).

A fungal NSTI was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 3.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-8.40; P = 0.02). Furthermore, fungal NSTI patients had longer lengths of stay (32 d [interquartile range, 16-53] versus 19 d [interquartile range, 11-31], P < 0.01), more likely to require initiation of renal replacement therapy (24.1% versus 8.6%, P = 0.02), and more likely to require mechanical ventilation (64.5% versus 42.0%, P = 0.02). Initiation of antifungals was associated with a significantly lower rate of in-hospital mortality (6.7% versus 57.1%, P = 0.01). Fungal NSTIs are more common in patients taking immunosuppressive medications and are significantly associated with in-hospital mortality. Antifungal therapy is associated with decreased in-hospital mortality in those with fungal NSTIs.

We performed descriptive analyses using Fisher's exact, Student's t, chi-squared, or Mann-Whitney U tests as appropriate. Thirty-seven patients with acute hemorrhage from nontrauma sources were identified. REBOA placement was primarily performed by trauma attendings (20/37, 54%) and vascular attendings (13/37, 35%). In seven patients (19%), balloons were positioned prophylactically but never inflated. In 24 (65%) of 37 patients, REBOA was placed in the operating room. 28/37 balloons (76%) were advanced to zone 1, 8/37 (22%) were advanced to zone 3, and there was one REBOA use in the inferior vena cava. Most common indications were gastrointestinal and peripartum bleeding. In the 30 cases of balloon inflation, 24 of 30 (80%) resulted in improved hemodynamics. Eleven of 30 patients (37%) died before discharge. One patient developed a distal embolism, but there were no reports of limb loss.

Retrospective cohort study using the 2014 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Readmissions Database. Participants were all adult patients (18 years or older) who underwent 1 of the 15 most common EGS procedures in the United States from January 1 to November 30, 2014, and survived to discharge. The dates of analysis were October through December 2019. Thirty-day readmission to a hospital other than that of the index surgical procedure. The study examined the association of interventions during readmission, change in hospital resource level, and severity of patient illness during readmission. Ninety-day inpatient mortality. In total, 71 944 patients who underwent EGS (mean [SD] age, 59.0 [18.3] years; 53.5% [38 487 of 71 944] female) were readmitted within 30 days of discharge, of whom 10 495 (14.6%) were readmitted to a nonindex hospital. Compared with patients readmitted to index hospitals, patients readmitted to nonindex hospitals were more likely to be readmitted to hospitals with low annual EGS volume (33.5% vs 25.6%, P < .001) and be in the top half of illness severity profile (37.2% vs 31.2%, P < .001). Overall 90-day mortality was higher in the patients readmitted to nonindex hospitals (6.1% vs 4.3%, P < .001). When adjusted for baseline patient and hospital characteristics, care fragmentation was independently associated with increased mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.36; 95% CI, 1.17-1.58; P < .001). After adjustment for interventions performed during readmission, change in EGS hospital volume level, and severity of patient illness, care fragmentation was no longer independently associated with mortality (aOR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.88-1.26; P = .58). In this complete model, severity of illness was the strongest risk factor of mortality during readmission. In this cohort study of adult patients who require rehospitalization after EGS, 14.6% are readmitted to a hospital other than where the index procedure was performed. Although the overall mortality rate is higher for this population, the excess mortality appears to be primarily associated with severity of patient illness at time of readmission. These data underscore the need to develop systems of care to rapidly triage patients to hospitals best equipped to manage their condition."

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of EGS operations using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (NSQIP) dataset, 2011-2017. 16 major complications were categorized as infectious, respiratory, thrombotic, cardiac, renal, neurologic, or technical. We tabulated common combinations of complications. We then use logistic regression analyses to test the hypotheses that (1) increase in the number and frequency of complications would yield higher FTR rates and (2) secondary complications that span a greater number of organ systems or mechanisms carry a greater associated FTR risk. Of 329 183 EGS patients, 69 832 (21.2%) experienced at least 1 complication. Of the 11 195 patients who died following complication (16.0%), 8205 (63.4%) suffered more than 1 complication. Multivariable regression analyses revealed an association between the number of complications and mortality risk (odds ratio [OR] 2.37 for 2 complications vs 1, P < .001). There was a similar increase in mortality with increased complication accrual rate (OR 3.29 for 0.2-0.4 complications/day vs <0.2, P < .001). Increasing the number of types of complication were similarly associated with mortality risk. While past FTR analyses have focused primarily on index complication, a broader consideration of ensuing trajectory may enable identification of high-risk cohorts. Efforts to reduce mortality in EGS should focus on attention to those who suffer a complication to prevent a cascade of downstream complications culminating in death."

    "abstract": "The constant pressure facing hospitals to reduce emergency inpatient admissions has led towards more consultant-led 'Hot Clinics' (HC). The patient experience in these settings remains poorly understood. This study evaluates the efficiency and ability of the HC to prevent unnecessary emergency surgical admissions and factors influencing the patient experience. Patients were referred to the HC from the Emergency Department, General Practice or Out-of-Hours service over the initial six-week period. A questionnaire collected the reason for referral, management without a HC, final diagnosis and management. Appropriateness of referrals were evaluated by the HC consultant and retrospectively by a blinded consultant. A second questionnaire collected information on patient satisfaction in a subsequent study period. 119/126 referrals (94%) were judged appropriate in the HC analysis with 97/126 (77%) considered appropriate in the retrospective analysis. The HC reduced the amount of potential emergency surgical admissions from 114 to 14 (p < 0.001). In the second period, 114/121 patients (94%) rated the HC as very good or good; with privacy (p < 0.05) and decision-making (p < 0.001) linked to patient satisfaction. Comfort (p < 0.05) and decision-making (p < 0.001) were linked to patients recommending the service. 103 patients (85%) would be extremely, or very likely to recommend the HC service with 93 patients (77%) preferring HC treatment over a hospital admission. Most referrals to the HC were appropriate and it continues to prevent unnecessary emergency surgical admissions. The HC service is valued by NHS patients, who prefer HC treatment over admission. Various factors to improve the patient experience in HC have been identified."

    "abstract": "during the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of Acute Care Surgery procedures performed in Spanish hospitals decreased significantly. The aim of this study was to compare Acute Care Surgery activity during the COVID-19 pandemic and during a control period. a multicenter retrospective cohort study was performed including patients who underwent Acute Care Surgery in three tertiary care hospitals in Spain during a control (11th March 2019 to 21st April 2019) and a pandemic (16th March 2020 to 26th April 2020) period. Type of surgical procedures, patients' features and postoperative complications were compared. two hundred and eighty-five and 117 patients were included in each group. Mean number of patients who underwent Acute Care Surgery during the control and pandemic periods was 2.3 and 0.9 patients per day and hospital (p < 0.001), representing a 58.9% decrease in Acute Care Surgery activity. Time from symptoms onset to patient arrival at the Emergency Department was longer during the pandemic (44.6 vs. 71.0 h, p < 0.001). Surgeries due to acute cholecystitis and complications from previous elective procedures decreased (26.7% vs. 9.4%) during the pandemic, while bowel obstructions and abdominal wall hernia surgeries increased (12.3% vs. 22.2%) (p = 0.001). Morbidity was higher during pandemic period (34.7% vs. 47.1%, p = 0.022), although this difference was not statistically significant in the multivariate analysis. Reoperation rate (17.9% vs. 12.8%, p = 0.212) and mortality (6.7% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.358) were similar in both groups. during the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant reduction in the performance of Acute Care Surgery procedures was observed. Moreso, a longer time from symptoms onset to patient arrival at the Emergency Department was noted. Higher morbidity was observed in patients undergoing Acute Care Surgery during the pandemic period, although there was not any difference in mortality or reoperation rate."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to answer 2 questions: first, to what degree does hospital operative volume affect mortality for adult patients undergoing 1 of 10 common emergency general surgery (EGS) operations? Second, at what hospital operative volume threshold will nearly all patients undergoing an emergency operation realize the average mortality risk? Nontrauma surgical emergencies are an underappreciated public health crisis in the United States; redefining where such emergencies are managed may improve outcomes. The field of trauma surgery established regionalized systems of care in part because studies demonstrated a clear relationship between hospital volume and survival for traumatic emergencies. Such a relationship has not been well-studied for nontrauma surgical emergencies. Retrospective cohort study of all acute care hospitals in California performing nontrauma surgical emergencies. We employed a novel use of an ecological analysis with beta regression to investigate the relationship between hospital operative volume and mortality. A total of 425 acute care hospitals in California performed 165,123 EGS operations. Risk-adjusted mortality significantly decreased as volume increased for all 10 EGS operations (P < 0.001 for each); the relative magnitude of this inverse relationship differed substantially by procedure. Hospital operative volume thresholds were defined and varied by operation: from 75 cases over 2 years for cholecystectomy to 7 cases for umbilical hernia repair. Survival rates for nontrauma surgical emergencies were improved when operations were performed at higher-volume hospitals. The use of ecological analysis is widely applicable to the field of surgical outcomes research."

    "abstract": "Aim The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the delivery of elective, as well as emergency surgery on a world-wide scale. Up to date few studies have actually assessed the impact of COVID-19 on the postoperative morbidity and mortality following emergency gastrointestinal surgery. Herein, we present our relevant experience over a 3-month period of uninterrupted provision of emergency general surgery services in George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust, the United Kingdom. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospective institutional database, which included the operation types, paraclinical investigations and postoperative complications of all patients undergoing emergency general surgery operations between March - May 2020. Results The occurrence of a 5% overall respiratory complication rate postoperatively, with 3% infection rate for COVID-19 was found; no patient had unplanned return to intensive care for ventilator support and there was no mortality related to COVID-19 infection. Conclusion When indicated, emergency surgery should not be delayed in favour of expectant/conservative management in fear of COVID-19-related morbidity or mortality risks."

    "abstract": "Despite the widespread implementation of the acute care surgery (ACS) model, limited access to operating room time represents a barrier to the optimal delivery of emergency general surgery (EGS) care. The objective of this study was to describe the effect of operative timing on outcomes in EGS in a network of teaching hospitals. We conducted a retrospective review of EGS operations performed at 3 teaching hospitals in a single academic network. Time of operation was categorized as daytime (8 am to 5 pm), after hours (5 pm to 11 pm) or overnight (11 pm to 8 am). Time to operation was calculated as the interval from admission to operative start time and categorized as less than 24 hours, 24-72 hours and greater than 72 hours. After we excluded nonindex cases, trauma cases and cases occurring more than 5 days after admission, 1505 EGS cases were included. We found that 39.0% of operations were performed in the daytime, 46.3% after hours and 14.8% overnight. In terms of time to operation, 52.3% of operations were performed within 24 hours of admission, 33.4% in 24-72 hours and 14.3% in more than 72 hours. The overall complication rate was 20.6% (310 patients) and the overall mortality rate was 3.8% (57 patients). After multivariable analysis, time to operation more than 72 hours after admission was independently associated with increased odds of morbidity (odds ratio [OR] 1.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-2.47), while overnight operating was associated with increased odds of death (OR 3.15, 95% CI 1.29-7.70). Increasing time from admission to operation and overnight operating were associated with greater morbidity and mortality, respectively, for EGS patients. Strategies to provide timely access to the operating room should be considered to optimize care in an ACS model. Même si le modèle de chirurgie en soins actifs (CSA) est largement répandu, l’accès limité aux blocs opératoires représente un obstacle à la chirurgie générale chez les patients des services d’urgence (CGSU). L’objectif de cette étude était de décrire l’effet du moment de l’intervention sur l’issue des CGSU dans un réseau d’hôpitaux universitaires. Nous avons procédé à une revue des CGSU effectuées dans 3 hôpitaux d’enseignement d’un réseau universitaire. Le moment opératoire était catégorisé selon que les interventions étaient effectuées le jour (8 h 00 à 17 h 00), le soir (17 h 00 à 23 h 00) ou la nuit (23 h 00 à 8 h 00). Le délai opératoire représentait l’intervalle entre l’admission et le début de l’intervention et était réparti selon les catégories suivantes : moins de 24 heures, de 24 à 72 heures et plus de 72 heures. Après exclusion des cas non index, des cas de traumatologie et des cas survenus plus de 5 jours après l’admission, 1505 CGSU ont été incluses. Nous avons constaté que 39,0 % des interventions avaient été effectuées le jour, 46,3 % le soir et 14,8 % la nuit. Pour ce qui est du délai opératoire, 52,3 % des interventions ont été effectuées dans les 24 heures suivant l’admission, 33,4 % dans les 24 à 72 heures et 14,3 % plus de 72 heures après l’admission. Le taux global de complications a été de 20,6 % (310 patients) et le taux de mortalité global a été de 3,8 % (57 patients). Après analyse multivariée, le délai opératoire de plus de 72 heures suivant l’admission a été associé de manière indépendante à un risque accru de morbidité (rapport ces cotes [RC] 1,64, intervalle de confiance [IC]) de 95 % 1,09 à 2,47), tandis que les interventions effectuées la nuit ont été associées à un risque de décès plus élevé (RC 3,15, IC de 95 % 1,29 à 7,70). L’augmentation du délai entre l’admission et l’intervention et les interventions de nuit ont été associées à une morbidité et une mortalité plus élevées, respectivement, chez les patients soumis à des CGSU. Des stratégies visant à offrir un accès rapide aux blocs opératoires sont à envisager pour optimiser le modèle de CSA."

    "abstract": "As the COVID-19 pandemic sweeps across the world, healthcare departments must adapt to meet the challenges of service provision and staff/patient protection. Unlike elective surgery, acute care surgery (ACS) workloads cannot be artificially reduced providing a unique challenge for administrators to balance healthcare resources between the COVID-19 surge and regular patient admissions. An enhanced ACS (eACS) model of care is described with the aim of limiting COVID-19 healthcare worker and patient cross-infection as well as providing 24/7 management of emergency general surgical (GS) and trauma patients. The eACS service comprised 5 independent teams covering a rolling 1:5 24-hr call. Attempts to completely separate eACS teams and patients from the elective side were made. The service was compared to the existing ACS service in terms of clinical and efficiency outcomes. Finally, a survey of staff attitudes towards these changes, concerns regarding COVID-19 and psychological well-being was assessed. There were no staff/patient COVID-19 cross-infections. Compared to the ACS service, eACS patients had reduced overall length of stay (2-days), time spent in the Emergency Room (46 min) and time from surgery to discharge (2.4-hours). The eACS model of care saved financial resources and bed-days for the organisation. The changes were well received by team-members who also felt that their safety was prioritised. In healthcare systems not overwhelmed by COVID-19, an eACS model may assist in preserving psychological well-being for healthcare staff whilst providing 24/7 care for emergency GS and trauma patients."

This study focuses on emergency general surgery services at a major trauma centre and teaching hospital. We aimed to identify whether the number of patients and the severity of their presentation has significantly changed since the implementation of a national lockdown. This study is a retrospective review of acute referrals (from general practice and accident and emergency) to the emergency general surgery team over a 14-day period before (group 1) and during (group 2) lockdown. A total of 151 patients were reviewed by the general surgical team in group 1 and 75 in group 2 (a 50.3% reduction). The number of days with symptoms prior to presentation was significantly shorter in group 1 compared with group 2 (3 vs 4, p = 0.04). There was no significant difference in the National Early Warning Score, white blood cell count, lymphocytes and C-reactive protein on admission between the two groups of patients. There were significantly fewer patients admitted after lockdown compared with pre-lockdown (66% vs 48%, p = 0.01). Length of hospital stay was significantly shorter during lockdown compared with pre-lockdown (5 days vs 4 days, p = 0.04). Fewer patients were referred and admitted during lockdown compared with pre-lockdown, and the length of stay was also significantly reduced. There was also a delay in presentation to hospital, although these patients were not more unwell based on the scoring criteria used within this study."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Emergency departments (EDs) during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are perceived as possible sources of infection. The effects of COVID-19 on patients presenting to the hospital with surgical complaints remain uncertain. Methods: A single tertiary center retrospective study analysis compared the ED attendance rate and severity of patients with surgical complaints between March 2020 (COVID-19 outbreak) and pre-COVID-19 periods: February 2020 and the same 2 months in 2019 and 2018. Results: Overall, 6,017 patients were included. The mean daily ED visits of patients with nontrauma surgical complaints in the COVID-19 outbreak period declined by 27%-32% (P value <.01) compared with pre-COVID-19 periods. The log number of confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases in Israel in March 2020 was negatively correlated with the number of ED visits (Pearson's r = -0.59, P < .01). The proportion of patients requiring hospitalization increased by up to 8% during the outbreak period (P < .01), and there was a higher proportion of tachycardic patients (20% versus 15.5%, P = .01). The percentage of visits to the ED by men declined by 5% (P < .01). The ED diagnosis distribution significantly changed during COVID-19 (P = .013), with an 84% decrease in the number of patients hospitalized for diverticular disease (P < .05). Conclusion: During the COVID-19 outbreak, the overall number of patients presenting at the ED with surgical complaints decreased significantly, and there was a higher admissions ratio. The extent to which the pandemic affects hospital ED attendance can help health care professionals prepare for future such events. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04338672."

Acute care surgeons, although not directly involved in treating COVID-19 + patients, have often modified their daily activity to help in this crisis. We have designed the first Italian survey on the effect of COVID-19 outbreak on Acute Care Surgery activity and submitted it to emergency surgeons in all the country to evaluate the experiences, trends, attitudes and possible educational outcomes that this emergency brought to light. A total of 532 valid surveys were collected during the study period. Lombardy and Lazio had the major answer rate. 96% of responders noticed a decrease in surgical emergencies. The outbreak affected regions and hospitals in different ways depending on the local incidence of infection. Half of responders modified their approach to intra-abdominal infections towards a more conservative treatment. 43% of responders, mainly in the North, were shifted to assist non-surgical patients. There has been a direct but non-homogeneous involvement of emergency surgeons. Almost all hospitals have responded with specific pathways and training. Both emergency surgery and trauma activity have changed and generally decreased but the majority of surgeons have operated on suspected COVID-19 patients."

    "abstract": "Outcome data on the very elderly patients undergoing emergency general surgery (EGS) are sparse. We sought to examine short- and long-term mortality in the 80 plus years population following EGS. Using our institutional 2008-2018 EGS Database, all the 80 plus years patients undergoing EGS were identified. The data were linked to the Social Security Death Index to determine cumulative mortality rates up to 3 years after discharge. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine predictors of in-hospital and 1-year cumulative mortality. A total of 385 patients were included with a mean age of 84 years; 54% were female. The two most common comorbidities were hypertension (76.1%) and cardiovascular disease (40.5%). The most common procedures performed were colectomy (20.0%), small bowel resection (18.2%), and exploratory laparotomy for other procedures (15.3%; e.g., internal hernia, perforated peptic ulcer). The overall in-hospital mortality was 18.7%. Cumulative mortality rates at 1, 2, and 3 years after discharge were 34.3%, 40.5%, and 43.4%, respectively. The EGS procedure associated with the highest 1-year mortality was colectomy (49.4%). Although hypertension, renal failure, hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated liver enzymes predicted in-hospital mortality, the only independent predictors of cumulative 1-year mortality were hypoalbuminemia (odds ratio, 2.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-4.27; p = 0.025) and elevated serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGOT) level (odds ratio, 2.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-4.70; p = 0.029) at initial presentation. Patients with both factors had a cumulative 1-year mortality rate of 75.0%. More than half of the very elderly patients undergoing major EGS were still alive at 3 years postdischarge. The combination of hypoalbuminemia and elevated liver enzymes predicted the highest 1-year mortality. Such information can prove useful for patient and family counseling preoperatively.

A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of outcome studies for emergent appendectomy and cholecystectomy from 1966 to 2017, comparing studies prior to and following ACS implementation, were performed. Of 1,704 studies, 27 were selected for analysis (appendicitis, 16; biliary pathology, 7; both, 4). Following ACS introduction, the complication rate was significantly reduced in both appendectomy and cholecystectomy (risk ratios, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-0.85; I = 9.2% and relative risk, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.41-0.94; I = 63.5%) respectively. There was a significant reduction in the time from arrival in emergency until admission and from admission to operation (-1.37 hours: 95% CI, -1.93 to -0.80; -2.51 hours: 95% CI, -4.44 to -0.58) in the appendectomy cohort. Time to operation was shorter in the cholecystectomy group (-6.46 hours; 95% CI, -9.54 to -3.4). Length of hospital stay was reduced in both groups (appendectomy, -0.9 day; cholecystectomy, -1.09 day). There was a reduction in overall cost in cholecystectomy group (-US $854.37; 95% CI, -1,554.1 to -154.05).

As part of our 2015 survey of acute care hospitals, we asked hospitals whether residents and advanced practice providers participate in emergency general surgery care. Data from responding hospitals were linked to patient data (≥18 years old admitted with an emergency general surgery diagnosis) from 17 State Inpatient Databases using American Hospital Association identifiers. Analyses compared emergency general surgery patient and hospital characteristics based on type of providers assisting emergency general surgery surgeons (none, only advanced practice providers, only residents, or both). Multivariable analysis determined if presence of advanced practice providers and/or residents was associated with type of management, mortality, or complications. Eighty-three hospitals and 49,271 unique emergency general surgery admissions were included. Hospitals without residents and advanced practice providers were most likely to manage patients operatively. However, hospitals with residents (alone or with advanced practice providers) had reduced odds of systemic complication compared with hospitals without clinical support (adjusted odds ratio 0.77 [95% confidence interval 0.60-0.98] and adjusted odds ratio 0.77 [95% confidence interval 0.62-0.95], respectively), while hospitals with only residents had the lowest odds of operative complication.

While some geographic variations in healthcare are normal, unwarranted variations raise questions about the quality, appropriateness, and cost-effectiveness of care in different areas. Patients ≥18 years who underwent 1 of 10 common EGS operations were identified using the State Inpatient Databases (2011-2012) for 6 states, representing Northeastern (New York) and Southeastern (Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, Mississippi) US. Geographic unit of analysis was the hospital service area (HSA). Age-standardized rates of operations and in-hospital mortality were calculated and mapped. Differences in rates across geographic areas were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and variance quantified using linear random-effects models. Variation profiles were tabulated via standardized rates of utilization and mortality to compare geographically heterogenous areas. 227,109 EGS operations were geospatially analyzed across the 6 states. Age-standardized EGS operation rates varied significantly by region (Northeast rate of 22.7 EGS operations per 10,000 in population versus Southeast 21.9; P < 0.001), state (ranging from 9.9 to 29.1; P < 0.001), and HSA (1.9-56.7; P < 0.001). The geographic variability in age-standardized EGS mortality rates was also significant at the region level (Northeast mortality rate 7.2 per 1000 operations vs Southeast 7.4; P < 0.001), state-level (ranging from 5.9 to 9.0 deaths per 1000 EGS operations; P < 0.001), and HSA-level (0.0-77.3; P < 0.001). Maps and variation profiles visually exhibited widespread and substantial differences in EGS use and morality. Wide geographic variations exist across 6 Northeastern and Southeastern US states in the rates of EGS operations and subsequent mortality. More detailed geographic analyses are needed to determine the basis of these variations and how they can be minimized."

A retrospective review of patients admitted to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Singapore, with acute appendicitis between two periods: May-October 2014 (6 months pre-ESAT) versus January-June 2017 (post-ESAT). Patient demographics, operative details, efficiency, clinical outcomes, and hospital bill savings were evaluated. There were 192 patients in the pre-ESAT period and 179 patients in the post-ESAT period. Patient demographics and comorbidities were comparable (P > 0.05). Time from emergency department referral to surgical review was significantly reduced in the ESAT period: 77.8 ± 46.9 min versus 127 ± 102 in the pre-ESAT period (P = 0.002). Time from case booking to operating theatre was significantly shorter in the ESAT period: 72.4 ± 55.2 min compared to 157.3 ± 209.1 (P < 0.01).

These were sectioned according to (1) device selection, (2) device characteristics, and (3) insertion technique. An interdisciplinary panel of experts (N = 14) consisting of leading experts representing diverse pediatric clinical disciplines including anesthesiology, cardiology and cardiac surgery, critical care and emergency, general surgery, hematology and oncology, hospital medicine, infectious disease, interventional radiology, pharmacology, regional pediatric hospitalist, and vascular access nursing specialties was convened. The scenarios were rated for appropriateness by the panel over 2 rounds (1 [highly inappropriate] to 9 [highly appropriate]). Round 1 ratings were completed anonymously and independently by panel members and classified into 3 levels of appropriateness: appropriate, uncertain, and inappropriate, or disagreement. For round 2, panelists met in-person to discuss the round 1 ratings and independently rerated the indications. All indications were reclassified into 3 levels of appropriateness or disagreement. The RAND Corporation-University of California, Los Angeles Appropriateness Method provides a rigorous, in-depth and transparent methodology to develop the first appropriateness criteria for the selection of pediatric vascular access devices in a range of patient groups."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is one of the main indications for urgent surgery representing a high-volume procedure worldwide. The current spending review in Italy (and not only in this country) affects the health service and warrants care regarding the use of different surgical devices. The aim of our study is to perform a cost evaluation, comparing the use of endoloops and staplers in complicated acute appendicitis (phlegmonous and gangrenous), taking into consideration the cost of the device in relation to the management of any associated postoperative complications. We retrospectively evaluated 996 laparoscopic appendectomies of adult patients performed in the Emergency General Surgery-St. Orsola University Hospital in Bologna (Italy). Surgical procedures together with the related choice of using endoloops or staplers were performed by attending surgeons or resident surgeons supervised by a tutor. A systematic review was performed to compare our outcomes with those reported in the literature. In our experience, the routine use of endoloop leads to a real estimated saving of 375€ for each performed laparoscopic appendectomy, even considering post-operative complications. Comparing endoloop and stapler groups, the total number of complications is significantly lower in the endoloop group. Our systematic review confirmed these findings even if the superiority of one technique has not been proved yet. Our analysis shows that the routine use of endoloop is safe in most patients affected by acute appendicitis, even when complicated, and it is a cost-effective device even when taking into consideration extra costs for potential post-operative complications."

    "abstract": "Transferred emergency general surgery (EGS) patients are a vulnerable, high acuity population. The outcomes of and health care utilization among transferred (TRAN) as compared to directly admitted (DA) patients have been studied primarily using single institution or hospital system data which limits generalizability. We evaluated these outcomes among EGS patients using a national database. We identified encounters of patients aged ≥18 years with a diagnosis of EGS as defined by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma in the 2008-2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS). Multivariable regression analyses determined if transfer status independently predicted in-hospital mortality (logistic regression) and morbidity (presence of any complication among those who survived to discharge; logistic regression), cost (log-linear regression), and duration of stay (among those who survived to discharge; log-linear regression) accounting for the NIS sampling design. We identified 274,145 TRAN (57,885 unweighted) and 10,456,100 DA (2,187,132 unweighted) encounters. On univariate analysis, TRAN patients were more likely to have greater comorbidity scores, have Medicare insurance, and reside in an area with a lesser median household income compared to DA patients (p<0.0001). Mortality was greater in the TRAN vs DA groups (4.4% vs 1.6%; p<0.0001). Morbidity (presence of any complication) was also greater among TRAN patients (38.8% vs 26.1%; p<0.0001). Morbidity among TRAN patients was primarily due to urinary- (13.7%), gastrointestinal- (12.9%), and pulmonary-related (13.3%) complications. Median duration of hospital stay was 4.3 days for TRAN vs 3.0 days for DA (p<0.0001) patients. Median cost was greater for TRAN patients ($8,935 vs $7,167; p<0.0001). Regression analyses determined that after adjustment, TRAN patients had statistically significantly greater mortality, morbidity, and cost as well as longer durations of stay. EGS patients who are transferred experience increased in-hospital morbidity and mortality as well as increased durations of stay and cost. As the population and age of patients diagnosed with EGS conditions increase while the EGS workforce decreases, the need for inter-hospital transfers will increase. Identifying risk factors associated with worse outcomes among transferred patients can inform the design of initiatives in performance improvement and direct the finite resources available to this vulnerable patient population."

    "abstract": "The handover period has been identified as a particularly vulnerable period for communication breakdown leading to patient safety events. Clear and concise handover is especially critical in high-acuity care settings such as trauma, emergency general surgery, and surgical critical care. There is no consensus for the most effective and efficient means of evaluating or performing handover in this population. We aimed to characterize the current handover practices and perceptions in trauma and acute care surgery. A survey was sent to 2265 members of the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma via email regarding handoff practices at their institution. Respondents were queried regarding their practice setting, average census, level of trauma center, and patients (trauma, emergency general surgery, and/or intensive care). Data regarding handover practices were gathered including frequency of handover, attendees, duration, timing, and formality. Finally, perceptions of handover including provider satisfaction, desire for improvement, and effectiveness were collected. Three hundred eighty surveys (17.1%) were completed. The majority (73.4%) of respondents practiced at level 1 trauma centers (58.9%) and were trauma/emergency general surgeons (86.5%). Thirty-five percent of respondents reported a formalized handover and 52% used a standardized tool for handover. Only 18% of respondents had ever received formal training, but most (51.6%) thought this training would be helpful. Eighty-one percent of all providers felt handover was essential for patient care, and 77% felt it prevented harm. Seventy-two percent thought their handover practice needed improvement, and this was more common as the average patient census increased. The most common suggestions for improvement were shorter and more concise handover (41.6%), different handover medium (24.5%), and adding verbal communication (13.9%). Trauma and emergency general surgeons perceive handover as essential for patient care and the majority desire improvement of their current handover practices. Methods identified to improve the handover process include standardization, simplification, and verbal interaction, which allows for shared understanding. Formal education and best practice guidelines should be developed."

    "abstract": "COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread in Italy in late February 2020. Almost all surgical services have been reorganized, with the aim of maintaining an adequate therapeutic path, especially for surgical emergencies. The knowledge of how surgeons dealing with emergency surgery have reacted to the epidemic in the real life can be useful while drafting clinical recommendations. Surgeons from multiple Italian regions were invited answering to an online survey in order to make a snapshot of their current behaviors towards COVID-19-positive patients bearing urgent surgical diseases. Questions about institutional rules and personal approach for patient treatment and to limit epidemic spread were included in a 37-item questionnaire. Seventy-one questionnaires from institutions dealing with emergency surgery were accepted. Participating surgeons were equally subdivided from a geographical point of view, with a large proportion of public (97.2%) and non-academical (91.5%) centers. In 80.3% of cases, the hospitals treated COVID-19 patients; in 69.1% of centers, a change in work plan was necessary, and 33.8% of teams had almost a surgeon infected or in preventive quarantine. The vast majority of surgeons operated only on urgent cases (73.9%), but the number of interventions significantly dropped. Up to 40% of non-traumatic abdominal emergency cases had an unusual delayed treatment. The laparoscopic approach was used in 69.6% of interventions on COVID-19 patients. Strategies to protect health care workers against COVID-19 infection and to identify asymptomatic infected surgeons were suboptimal with respect to the WHO recommendations in 70.4% and 90.2% of centers, respectively. Advanced personal protective equipment for operating room workers was adopted for all surgeries in only 12.7% of centers. This survey confirms that the COVID-19 outbreak is dramatically changing the practice of emergency surgery centers in Italy. Despite the reduction in number, urgent cases were on average more challenging owing to diagnostic delay. Recommendations from the International Scientific Societies are frequently not complied concerning the use of laparoscopic approach, the availability of personal protective equipment in the operating rooms, and the testing of both asymptomatic physicians and patients scheduled for surgery. A further evaluation of the short-term results of these attitudes is warranted to modulate international recommendations."

This study aimed to evaluate the service delivery factors in a tertiary referral centre which may influence patient outcomes in emergency general surgery. Data on consecutive patients undergoing emergency laparotomy in a tertiary referral centre were prospectively collected from July 2017-July 2018. An extensive review of patient charts and IT systems was performed to extract demographic, clinical and care pathway data. Transfers for surgery from within the institution or within the centralised hospital network were recorded. The unadjusted 30-day mortality rate in 163 patients undergoing emergency laparotomy was 13%. On multivariate analysis, 30-day mortality was significantly associated with p-POSSUM predicted mortality (p = 0.003), p-POSSUM predicted morbidity (p = 0.01), SORT mortality (p = 0.004), ICU admission (p = 0.02), ASA grade (p < 0.001) and transfer from non-surgical services (p < 0.001). 19.2% of patients were transferred from a referring hospital for emergency laparotomy. There was no association between inter-hospital transfer and 30-day mortality while increased mortality was observed in patients admitted to non-surgical services who required laparotomy (p < 0.001). Inter-hospital transfer for emergency laparotomy was not associated with increased mortality. Increased mortality was observed in patients admitted to non-surgical services who subsequently required emergency laparotomy. Configuration of emergency general surgery services must accommodate safe and effective transfer of patients, both between and within hospitals."

    "abstract": "Complicated acute biliary calculous disease poses clinical challenges. The European Society of Trauma and Emergency Surgery (ESTES) snapshot audit of complicated biliary calculous disease aims to make novel comparisons between self-reported institutional adherence to the Tokyo guidelines (TG18) and 'real-world' contemporary practice across Europe. A preplanned analysis of a prospective observational multicentre audit that captured patients undergoing emergency admission for complicated biliary calculous disease (complicated cholecystitis, biliary pancreatitis, or choledocholithiasis with or without cholangitis) between 1 and 31 October 2018 was performed. An anonymized survey was administered to participating sites. Following an open call for participation, 25 centres from nine countries enrolled 338 patients. All centres completed the anonymized survey. Fifteen centres (60 per cent) self-reported that a minority of patients were treated surgically on index admission, favouring interval cholecystectomy. This was replicated in the snapshot audit, in which 152 of 338 patients (45·0 per cent) underwent index admission cholecystectomy, 17 (5·0 per cent) had interval cholecystectomy, and the remaining 169 (50·0 per cent) had not undergone surgery by the end of the 60-day follow-up. Centres that employed a dedicated acute care surgery model of care were more likely to perform index admission cholecystectomy compared with a traditional general surgery 'on call' service (57 versus 38 per cent respectively; odds ratio 2·14 (95 per cent c.i. 1·37 to 3·35), P < 0·001). Six centres (24 per cent) self-reported routinely performing blood cultures in acute cholecystitis; patient-level audit data revealed that blood cultures were done in 47 of 154 patients (30·5 per cent). No centre self-reported omitting antibiotics in the management of acute cholecystitis, and 144 of 154 (93·5 per cent) of patients in the snapshot audit received antibiotics during their index admission. Awareness of TG18 recommendations was high, but self-reported adherence and objective snapshot audit data showed low compliance with TG18 in patients with complicated acute biliary calculous disease. La complicación aguda de la litiasis biliar (complicated acute biliary calculous disease, CABCD) plantea retos clínicos. Esta auditoría de la Sociedad Europea de Trauma y Cirugía de Urgencias (European Society of Trauma and Emergency Surgery, ESTES) de la CABCD tuvo como objetivo comparar el conocimiento teórico de las recomendaciones de Tokio (TG18) y la “práctica real” en Europa. MÉTODOS: Se efectuó un análisis pre-establecido de los datos de una auditoría prospectiva, observacional y multicéntrica que incluyó los pacientes ingresados de urgencia por CABCD (es decir, colecistitis complicada, pancreatitis biliar o coledocolitiasis con o sin colangitis) entre el 1 y el 31 de octubre de 2018. Además, se realizó una encuesta anónima en los centros participantes. Tras una convocatoria abierta, 25 centros de 9 países incluyeron 338 pacientes. Todos los centros completaron la encuesta anónima. El 60% de los centros reconocieron que trataban en el mismo ingreso una minoría de los pacientes y que favorecían la colecistectomía diferida. Ello se reprodujo en la auditoria, donde a 152/338 (44,9%) de los pacientes se realizó la colecistectomía en el mismo ingreso, a 17/338 (5%) se realizó una colecistectomía diferida y que a 169/338 (50%) todavía no se había realizado ninguna intervención en los 60 días de seguimiento. Los centros que seguían el Modelo de Atención Quirúrgica Urgente tenían mayores probabilidades de realizar la colecistectomía en el mismo ingreso en comparación con un servicio de cirugía general tradicional 'de guardia' (57% versus 38,4%, razón de oportunidades, odds ratio, OR 2,14 (i.c. del 95% 1,37-3,35), P < 0,001)). El 24% de los centros afirmaron realizar hemocultivos de rutina en la colecistitis aguda. Sin embargo, los datos de la auditoría revelaron que solamente 47/154 (30,5%) de los pacientes tenían hemocultivos. Ningún centro declaró no administrar antibióticos en el tratamiento de la colecistitis aguda, mientras que 144/154 (93,5%) de los pacientes de la auditoría no recibieron antibióticos durante el ingreso. El conocimiento de las recomendaciones de TG18 fue alto. Sin embargo, la observancia reconocida por los centros y los datos objetivos de la auditoría muestran que el cumplimiento en los pacientes con CABCD es bajo."

    "abstract": "Worldwide, injuries account for approximately five million mortalities annually, with 90% occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Although guidelines characterizing data for blood product transfusion in injury resuscitation have been established for high-income countries (HICs), no such information on use of blood products in LMICs exists. This systematic review evaluated the available literature on the use and associated outcomes of blood product transfusion therapies in LMICs for acute care of patients with injuries. A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Global Health, CINAHL and Cochrane databases through November 2018 was performed by a health sciences medical librarian. Prospective and cross-sectional reports of injured patients from LMICs involving data on blood product transfusion therapies were included. Two reviewers identified eligible records (κ=0.92); quality was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Report elements, patient characteristics, injury information, blood transfusion therapies provided and mortality outcomes were extracted and analyzed. Of 3411 records, 150 full-text reports were reviewed and 17 met inclusion criteria. Identified reports came from the World Health Organization regions of Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean, and South-East Asia. A total of 6535 patients were studied, with the majority from exclusively inpatient hospital settings (52.9%). Data on transfusion therapies demonstrated that packed red blood cells were given to 27.0% of patients, fresh frozen plasma to 13.8%, and unspecified product types to 50.1%. Among patients with blunt and penetrating injuries, 5.8% and 15.7% were treated with blood product transfusions, respectively. Four reports provided data on comparative mortality outcomes, of which two found higher mortality in blood transfusion-treated patients than in untreated patients at 17.4% and 30.4%. The overall quality of evidence was either low (52.9%) or very low (41.2%), with one report of moderate quality by GRADE criteria. There is a paucity of high-quality data to inform appropriate use of blood transfusion therapies in LMIC injury care. Studies were geographically limited and did not include sufficient data on types of therapies and specific injury patterns treated. Future research in more diverse LMIC settings with improved data collection methods is needed to inform injury care globally."

    "abstract": "The importance of the patient experience is increasingly being recognised. However, there is a dearth of studies regarding factors affecting patient-reported outcomes in emergency general surgery (EGS), including none from the Southern Hemisphere. We aim to prospectively assess factors associated with patient satisfaction in this setting. In this prospective cross-sectional study, all consecutive adult patients admitted to an acute surgical unit over four weeks were invited to complete a validated Patient-Reported Experience Measures questionnaire. These were completed either in person when discharge was imminent or by telephone  <4 weeks post-discharge. Responses were used to determine factors associated with overall patient satisfaction. From 146 eligible patients, 100 (68%) completed the questionnaire, with a mean overall satisfaction score of 8.3/10. On multivariate analyses, eight factors were significantly associated with increased overall satisfaction. Five of these were similar to those previously prescribed by other like studies, being patient age  >50 years, sufficient analgesia, satisfaction with the level of senior medical staff, important questions answered by nurses and confidence in decisions made about treatment. Three identified factors were new: sufficient privacy in the emergency department, sufficient notice prior to discharge and feeling well looked after in hospital. Factors associated with patient satisfaction were identified at multiple points of the patient journey. While some of these have been reported in similar studies, most differed. Hospitals should assess factors valued by their EGS population prior to implementing initiatives to improve patient satisfaction."

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is a new disease, based on currently available limited information, older adults and people of any age who have severe underlying medical conditions may be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. People of all age groups are also at risk. Healthcare providers have always been the professionals most exposed to the risk of contracting to any kind of infection due to the nature of their profession. Elective interventions have been postponed to give care of patients with COVID-19. However, some interventions cannot be delayed, such as trauma surgery, acute abdomen, and emergency endoscopies. To maintain the sustainability of the healthcare system, the protection of healthcare providers should be the top priority. On the other hand, patients, who need emergency healthcare, should also be provided with appropriate treatment. Healthcare professionals should choose a treatment method appropriately in the circumstances to protect themselves and their patients as much as possible. This paper aims to summarize how a surgeon may act appropriately when an intervention is inevitable during the COVID-19 pandemic."

    "abstract": "Geriatric patients frequently undergo emergency general surgery and accrue a greater risk of postoperative complications and fatal outcomes than the general population. It is highly relevant to develop the most appropriate care measures and to guide patient-centered decision-making around end-of-life care. Portsmouth - Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enumeration of Mortality and morbidity (P-POSSUM) has been used to predict mortality in patients undergoing different types of surgery. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the relative importance of the P-POSSUM score for predicting 90-day mortality in the elderly subjected to emergency laparotomy from statistical aspects. One hundred and fifty-seven geriatric patients aged ≥65 years undergoing emergency laparotomy between January 1st, 2015 and December 31st, 2016 were included in the study. Mortality and 27 other patient characteristics were retrieved from the computerized records of Örebro University Hospital in Örebro, Sweden. Two supervised classification machine methods (logistic regression and random forest) were used to predict the 90-day mortality risk. Three scalers (Standard scaler, Robust scaler and Min-Max scaler) were used for variable engineering. The performance of the models was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Importance of the predictors were evaluated using permutation variable importance and Gini importance. The mean age of the included patients was 75.4 years (standard deviation =7.3 years) and the 90-day mortality rate was 29.3%. The most common indication for surgery was bowel obstruction occurring in 92 (58.6%) patients. Types of post-operative complications ranged between 7.0-36.9% with infection being the most common type. Both the logistic regression and random forest models showed satisfactory performance for predicting 90-day mortality risk in geriatric patients after emergency laparotomy, with AUCs of 0.88 and 0.93, respectively. Both models had an accuracy > 0.8 and a specificity ≥0.9. P-POSSUM had the greatest relative importance for predicting 90-day mortality in the logistic regression model and was the fifth important predictor in the random forest model. No notable change was found in sensitivity analysis using different variable engineering methods with P-POSSUM being among the five most accurate variables for mortality prediction. P-POSSUM is important for predicting 90-day mortality after emergency laparotomy in geriatric patients. The logistic regression model and random forest model may have an accuracy of > 0.8 and an AUC around 0.9 for predicting 90-day mortality. Further validation of the variables' importance and the models' robustness is needed by use of larger dataset."

    "abstract": "The Acute Care Surgery (ACS) model was developed as a dedicated service for the provision of 24/7 nontrauma emergency surgical care. This systematic review investigated which components are essential in an ACS model and the state of implementation of ACS models worldwide. A literature search was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library, and Web of Science databases. All relevant data of ACS models were extracted from included articles. The search identified 62 articles describing ACS models in 13 countries. The majority consist of a dedicated nontrauma emergency surgical service, with daytime on-site attending coverage (cleared from elective duties), and 24/7 in-house resident coverage. Emergency department coverage and operating room access varied widely. Critical care is fully embedded in the original US model as part of the acute care chain (ACC), but is still a separate unit in most other countries. While in most European countries, ACS is not a recognized specialty yet, there is a tendency toward more structured acute care. Large national and international heterogeneity exists in the structure and components of the ACS model. Critical care is still a separate component in most systems, although it is an essential part of the ACC to provide the best pre-, intra- and postoperative care of the physiologically deranged patient. Universal acceptance of one global ACS model seems challenging; however, a global consensus on essential components would benefit any healthcare system."

    "abstract": "In the UK, general surgeons must demonstrate competency in emergency general surgery before obtaining a certificate of completion of training. Subsequently, many consultants develop focused elective specialist interests which may not mirror the breadth of procedures encountered during emergency practice. Recent National Emergency Laparotomy Audit analysis found that declared surgeon special interest impacted emergency laparotomy outcomes, which has implications for emergency general surgery service configuration. We sought to establish whether local declared surgeon special interest impacts emergency laparotomy outcomes. Adult patients having emergency laparotomy were identified from our prospective National Emergency Laparotomy Audit database from May 2016 to May 2019 and categorised as colorectal or oesophagogastric according to operative procedure. Outcomes included 30-day mortality, return to theatre and length of stay. Binomial logistic regression was used to identify any association between declared consultant specialist interest and outcomes. Of 600 laparotomies, 358 (58.6%) were classifiable as specialist procedures: 287 (80%) colorectal and 71 (20%) oesophagogastric. Discordance between declared specialty and operation undertaken occurred in 25% of procedures. For colorectal emergency laparotomy, there was an increased risk of 30-day mortality when performed by a non-colorectal consultant (unadjusted odds ratio 2.34; 95% confidence interval 1.10-5.00; p = 0.003); however, when adjusted for confounders within multivariate analysis declared surgeon specialty had no impact on mortality, return to theatre or length of stay. Surgeon-declared specialty does not impact emergency laparotomy outcomes in this cohort of undifferentiated emergency laparotomies. This may reflect the on-call structure at Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, where a colorectal and oesophagogastric consultant are paired on call and provide cross-cover when needed."

Portsmouth-Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enumeration of Mortality and Morbidity (P-POSSUM) is one of the most widely used scores. National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA) presents a novel, validated score, but no direct comparison with P-POSSUM exists. We aimed to determine which would be the best predictor of mortality. We analysed all the entries on the online NELA database over a four-and-a-half-year period. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test was performed to assess model calibration. For the outcome of death and for each scoring system, a non-parametric receiver operator characteristic analysis was done. The sensitivity, specificity, area under receiver operator characteristic curve and their standard errors were calculated. Data pertaining to 650 patients were included. There were 59 deaths, giving an overall observed mortality rate of 9.1%. Predicted mortality rate for the P-POSSUM score and NELA score were 15.2% and 7.8%, respectively. The discriminative power for mortality was highest for the NELA score (C-index = 0.818, CI: 0.769-0.867, p < 0.001), when compared to P-POSSUM (C-index = 0.769, CI: 0.712-0.827, p < 0.001). The NELA score showed good discrimination in predicting mortality in the entire cohort. The P-POSSUM over-predicted observed mortality and the NELA score under-predicted observed mortality."

    "abstract": "The timing, causes, and quality of care for patients who die after emergency laparotomy have not been extensively reported. A large database of 13,953 patients undergoing emergency laparotomy, between July 2014 and March 2017, from 28 hospitals in England was studied. Anonymized data was extracted on day of death, patient demographics, operative details, compliance with standards of care, and 30-day and in-patient mortality. Thirty-day mortality was 8.9%, and overall inpatient mortality was 9.8%. Almost 40% of postoperative deaths occurred within three days of surgery, and 70% of these early deaths occurred on the day of surgery or the first postoperative day. Such early deaths could be considered nonbeneficial surgery. Patients who died within three days of surgery had a significantly higher preoperative lactate, American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA-PS) grade, and Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enumeration of Mortality and morbidity (P-POSSUM). Compliance with perioperative standards of care based on the Emergency Laparotomy Collaborative care bundle was high overall and better for those patients who died within three days of surgery. Multidisciplinary team involvement from intensive care, care of the elderly physicians, and palliative care may help both the communication and the burden of responsibility in deciding on the risk-benefit of operative versus nonoperative approaches to care."

However, it is unknown if this association is present in patients who undergo emergency general surgery (EGS). To investigate whether emergency case status is independently associated with VTE compared with elective case status and to test the hypothesis that emergency cases would have a higher risk of VTE. This retrospective cohort study used the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2016, for all cholecystectomies, ventral hernia repairs (VHRs), and partial colectomies (PCs) to obtain a sample of commonly encountered emergency procedures that have elective counterparts. Emergency surgeries were then compared with elective surgeries. The dates of analysis were January 1 to 31, 2019. The primary outcome was VTE at 30 days. A multivariable analysis controlling for age, sex, body mass index, bleeding disorder, disseminated cancer, laparoscopy approach, and surgery type was performed. There were 604 537 adults undergoing surgical procedures over 12 years (mean [SD] age, 55.3 [16.6] years; 61.4% women), including 285 847 cholecystectomies, 158 500 VHRs, and 160 190 PCs. The rate of VTE within 30 days was 1.9% for EGS and 0.8% for elective surgery, a statistically significant difference. Overall, 4607 patients (0.8%) had deep vein thrombosis, and 2648 patients (0.4%) had pulmonary embolism. A total of 6624 VTEs (1.1%) occurred in the cohort. As expected, when VTE risk was examined by surgery type, the risk increased with invasiveness (0.5% for cholecystectomy, 0.8% for VHR, and 2.4% for PC; P < .001). On multivariable analysis, EGS was independently associated with VTE (odds ratio [OR], 1.70; 95% CI, 1.61-1.79). Also associated with VTE were open surgery (OR, 3.38; 95% CI, 3.15-3.63) and PC (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.73-1.99). In this cohort study, emergency surgery and increased invasiveness appeared to be independently associated with VTE compared with elective surgery. Further study on methods to improve VTE chemoprophylaxis is highly recommended for emergency and more extensive operations to reduce the risk of potentially lethal VTE."

    "abstract": "Emergency colonic surgery carries a high mortality rate. In the UK, strategies to improve outcomes in emergency general surgery recommend a consultant surgeon to be physically present during all operations involving a patient with a predicted mortality > 5%. To test the assertion of the consultant surgeon's presence in theatre as a determinate of improved outcome, we assessed patients following an emergency colonic resection and the effect of operator seniority. A retrospective analysis was undertaken for all patients undergoing an emergency colonic resection during a 4-year period between 2013 and 2017. Patient's pre-operative risk was assessed using P-POSSUM score and ASA grade. Outcomes assessed were post-operative morbidity (recorded using Clavien-Dindo classification), 30 day/inpatient mortality and length of stay (LOS). Outcomes were then compared between consultant and trainee led cases using univariate logistic regression techniques with results presented in terms of odds ratios (95% confidence intervals). A p value of 0.05 is used to determine statistical significance. A total of 130 patients were identified over the 4-year study period. 65% had their operation performed by a consultant and 35% by a trainee. Pre-operative P-POSSUM scores were the same between the groups (9.4% [5.0-25.2] vs 9.4% [4.9-28.6] p 0.75). There was no significant difference in post-operative complication rates between consultant and trainee led cases for minor (OR 1.58 [0.76-3.20] p 0.27) or major complications (OR 1.08 [0.50-2.31] p 0.84). Overall post-operative mortality was 14% with a trend for higher mortality rates in consultant led cases (15% vs 9%) albeit not statistically significant (p 0.57). Despite similar complication rates, trainee led operations were associated with slightly longer LOS at 19 (IQR 12-38) vs 15 (IQR 9-23) days (p 0.56). Emergency colonic surgery remains associated with a high level of morbidity and mortality. However, consultant presence at the operating table does not appear to be the sole determinant of outcome following an emergency colonic resection."

    "title": "Barriers to improving health care value in emergency general surgery: A nationwide analysis.",
    "abstract": "There is a growing need to improve the quality of care while decreasing health care costs in emergency general surgery (EGS). Health care value includes costs and quality and is a targeted metric by improvement programs. The aim of our study was to evaluate the trend of health care value in EGS over time and to identify barriers to high-value surgical care. The (2012-2015) National Readmission Database was queried for patients 18 years or older who underwent an EGS procedure (according to the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma definition). Health care value (V = quality metrics/cost) was calculated from the rates of freedom from readmission, major complications, reoperation, and failure to rescue (FTR) indexed over inflation-adjusted hospital costs. Outcomes were the trends in the quality metrics: 6-month readmission, major complications, reoperation, FTR, hospital costs, and health care value over the study period. Multivariable linear regression was performed to determine the predictors of lower health care value. We identified 887,013 patients who underwent EGS. Mean ± SD age was 51 ± 20 years, and 53% were male. The rates of 6-month readmission, major complications, reoperation, and FTR increased significantly over the study period. The median hospital costs also increased over the study period (2012, US $9,600 to 2015, US $13,000; p < 0.01). However, the health care value has decreased over the study period (2012, 0.35; 2013, 0.30; 2014, 0.28; 2015, 0.25; p < 0.01). Predictors of decreased health care value in EGS are age 65 years or older (β = -0.568 [-0.689 to -0.418], more than three comorbidities (β = -0.292 [-0.359 to -0.21]), readmission to a different hospital (β = -0.755 [-0.914 to -0.558]), admission to low volume centers (β = -0.927 [-1.126 to -0.682]), lack of rehabilitation (β = -0.004 [-0.005 to -0.003]), and admission on a weekend (β = -0.318 [-0.366 to -0.254]). Health care value in EGS appears to be declining over time. Some of the factors leading to decreased health care value in EGS are potentially modifiable. Health care value could potentially be improved by reducing fragmentation of care and promoting regionalization. Economic, level IV."

There was weak to no agreement between instruments and consensus among all three scales was 59.4%. Between 21 and 28% of patients seen in this ACS cohort were categorized as frail using the EGSFI, RAI-C and KI. These frailty tools have different measures of what constitutes frailty and there was poor agreement between them. Only the KI definition of frailty was associated with a longer LOS. The KI may be more useful for assessing ACS patients in a tertiary care facility."

Emergency general surgery ambulatory clinics facilitate timely review and intervention, avoiding admission; a critical limb ischaemia (CLI) 'hot clinic' (HC) was implemented to achieve similar for vascular patients. The aim of the study was to determine HC efficacy. This was a prospective cohort study comparing HC patients with emergency admission (EA) patients between 1 May and 1 December 2017. Age, sex, comorbidities, CLI severity and smoking status were noted. HC patients were provided with satisfaction surveys. Primary outcome measures were freedom from reintervention and major amputation. Secondary outcome measures included time to procedure, length of stay, returns to theatre and 30-day readmission. A total of 147 patients (72 HC, 75 EA) were enrolled in the study. No statistical difference was found in age, sex, smoking status, severity of CLI or prevalence of comorbidities between the groups except that diabetes was more prevalent in EA patients (p=0.028). The median length of stay for the HC cohort was shorter (3 days vs 17 days, p<0.001), with no difference between time to procedure, return to theatre or 30-day readmission. HC patients were nearly 6 times more likely to experience freedom from reintervention (odds ratio: 5.824, p<0.001) and 2.5 times less likely to undergo amputation (odds ratio: 2.616, p=0.043). HC utilisation saved a total of 441 bed days. Over 90% of attendees responded with 100% positive feedback. A vascular HC facilitates urgent review and revascularisation. It provides comparable in-hospital outcomes and better long-term outcomes, with greater efficiency than hospital admission, demonstrating its value in treating CLI."

Outcomes were the prevalence of CI, in-hospital complications, discharged to rehab/skilled nursing facility (SNF), and mortality. A total of 142 patients were enrolled. Overall prevalence of CI was 20%. Patients with CI had higher rates of complications (OR 1.6 [1.4-1.9]; p = 0.01), and discharge to rehab/SNF (OR 2.2 [2.0-2.5]; p = 0.03). There was no difference in mortality (OR 1.1 [0.6-1.8]; p = 0.24) between the 2 groups. One in five geriatric EGS patients has CI. It is associated with higher complications and adverse discharge.

Operative emergency general surgery (EGS) cases have been demonstrated to have a greater burden of DVT than other types of surgery. DVT in EGS cases were identified from the National Inpatient Sample-Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project database from 2001 to 2015 Q3 based on ICD-9 code specification. National incidence of DVT in EGS was calculated using the National Inpatient Sample-Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project sampling methodology, and propensity score matching was used to assess costs associated with DVT. Among 15,148,352 sample-weighted hospitalizations, 0.623% (94,392) experienced DVT. Incidence of DVT was greatest in GI ulcer surgery (1.705%) and lowest in appendectomy (0.095%). Patients with a perioperative DVT incurred $22,301 more in hospital-related costs than their counterparts who did not have a DVT. Although rates of DVT remained stable over the period analyzed, DVT-associated costs increased at a 2.09% annual rate in excess of inflation during the period analyzed. This increase in costs was most significant for laparotomy, which increased at a rate of 8.09% annually. DVT continues to be a significant burden on resources in EGS in spite of efforts with DVT prophylaxis. Considering the increase in costs and little change in incidence, further research on cost-effective management of DVT in EGS is warranted."

    "abstract": "Determine whether an educational video can improve surgical inpatients' attitudes toward resident participation in their care. Patients admitted to the Trauma/Emergency General Surgery Service at University Hospital (San Antonio, Texas) were randomly divided into control and intervention groups. Patients in the intervention group viewed a short educational video about the role and responsibilities of medical students, residents, and attending surgeons. All patients then completed a previously published survey. A total of 140 patients responded to the survey (control = 81 and intervention = 59 patients). Overall, 86.4% of patients were welcoming of resident participation. Patients who were expecting residents to be involved in their care had attitudes that are more favorable on almost all survey questions regardless of their study condition. However, patients in the intervention group who expected resident involvement in their care had more favorable attitudes about senior residents (postgraduate year 3-5) assisting in routine or complicated surgery than those in the control group who were expecting resident involvement (both p ≤ 0.001). This same group of patients also had more favorable attitudes about surgical outcomes and overall surgical health when residents are involved (p = 0.004, p = 0.001, respectively). Most patients (79%) said they had no residents previously involved in their care, or they were unsure if residents were previously involved. Patient expectation of resident involvement is one of the most important factors influencing perceptions of inpatients about resident participation in surgery. Our goal should be early and frequent discussion with patients about resident involvement in order to foster an atmosphere of trust, including full transparency regarding resident involvement in surgical procedures. An educational video may help introduce the roles of trainees and attending surgeons but should not be used in lieu of direct discussion with patients."

    "abstract": "Background: Early diagnosis and prompt debridement of necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) improves the outcome. We sought to determine whether failure to admit NSTI patients to acute care surgery (ACS) departments delays treatment and increases the mortality rate. Methods: Patients with NSTI were identified using the 2007-2018 institutional emergency surgery database at a tertiary care hospital. The diagnosis was confirmed by the operative/pathology reports. Patients who developed NSTI during hospitalization or underwent initial debridement at an outside hospital were excluded. Patients admitted to a non-ACS service (e.g., medicine, gynecology) were compared with those admitted to the ACS service with respect to co-morbidities, clinical presentation, time to surgery, and mortality rate. Multi-variable linear and logistic analyses were performed to determine whether admission to a non-ACS service predicts a delay in surgery or an increase in the mortality rate. Results: Of 132 patients, 91 met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 53 years; 56% were male. Twenty patients (22%) were admitted to a non-ACS service, two thirds of them with an initial misdiagnosis (e.g., cellulitis). The demographics, co-morbidities, and clinical presentation were similar in the two groups except that the non-ACS group more often had human immunodeficiency virus infection (15.0% versus 2.8%; p = 0.04) and less often presented with erythema (70% versus 94.4%; p = 0.01). The median time to incision in non-ACS patients was significantly longer (24.8 versus 3.9 hours; p < 0.001). The mortality rates were 20.0% for the non-ACS group and 7.0% for the ACS group (p = 0.086). Multi-variable analyses revealed that absence of erythema is independently associated with a non-ACS admission (odds ratio [OR] 5.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-25.6; p = 0.02), and non-ACS admissions correlated independently with delayed surgery (OR 35.20; 95% CI 3.86-321.20; p = 0.002). Conclusions: Admission of patients with NSTI to a non-ACS service often occurs because of initial misdiagnosis, especially in the absence of skin erythema; correlates with significantly delayed surgery; and might lead to more deaths."

Laparoscopy in abdominal trauma is gaining acceptance as a diagnostic and a therapeutic tool as it reduces surgical invasiveness and may reduce post-operative morbidity. All trauma patients who underwent a laparoscopic procedure between January 2013 and December 2017 were retrospectively analysed. A sub-analysis of isolated abdominal trauma was also performed. There has been a significant increase in the use of this technique in the considered time period. A total of 40 patients were included in the study: 17 diagnostic laparoscopies and overall 32 therapeutic laparoscopies. Conversion rate was 15%. All patients were hemodynamically stable. The majority of patients were younger than 60 years, with an ASA score of I-II and sustained a blunt trauma. Mean ISS score was 17. Colon and diaphragm were the most commonly laparoscopically diagnosed injuries, while splenectomy was the most common operation. The average operating time was 106 min. There were no missed injuries, no SSI, no re-interventions and no mortality related to the surgical procedure. The average length of stay was 14 days. No significant difference was found in the isolated abdominal trauma group. Laparoscopy is an emergent safe and effective technique for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in selected stable abdominal penetrating or blunt trauma patients. However, these results need to be put in relation with the level of the centre and the expertise of the surgeon."

    "abstract": "Acute care surgery (ACS) and emergency general surgery (EGS) services must provide timely care and intervention for patients who have some of the most challenging needs. Patients treated by ACS services are often critically ill and have both substantial comorbidities and poor physiologic reserve. Despite the widespread implemention of ACS/EGS services across North America, the true postoperative morbidity rates remain largely unknown. In this prospective study, inpatients at 8 high-volume ACS/EGS centres in geographically diverse locations in Canada who underwent operative interventions were followed for 30 days or until they were discharged. Readmissions during the 30-day window were also captured. Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative variables were tracked. Standard statistical methodology was employed. A total of 601 ACS/EGS patients were followed for up to 30 inpatient or readmission days after their index emergent operation. Fifty-one percent of patients were female, and the median age was 51 years. They frequently had substantial medical comorbidities (42%) and morbid obesity (15%). The majority of procedures were minimally invasive (66% laparoscopic). Median length of stay was 3.3 days and the early readmission (< 30 d) rate was 6%. Six percent of patients were admitted to the critical care unit. The overall complication and mortality rates were 34% and 2%, respectively. Cholecystitis (31%), appendicitis (21%), bowel obstruction (18%), incarcerated hernia (12%), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (7%) and soft tissue infections (7%) were the most common diagnoses. The morbidity and mortality rates for open surgical procedures were 73% and 5%, respectively. Nontrauma ACS/EGS procedures are associated with a high postoperative morbidity rate. This study will serve as a prospective benchmark for postoperative complications among ACS/EGS patients and subsequent quality improvement across Canada. Les services de chirurgie dans les unités de soins actifs (CSA) et de chirurgie générale dans les services d’urgence (CGSU) doivent fournir rapidement des soins et des interventions à des patients dont les besoins sont parmi les plus complexes. En effet, les patients pris en charge par les services de CSA sont souvent gravement malades et présentent des comorbidités sur fond de faible réserve physiologique. Même si les services de CSA/CGSU se sont répandus en Amérique du Nord, les taux réels de morbidité postopératoire demeurent pour une bonne part inconnus. Dans cette étude prospective, on a suivi pendant 30 jours ou jusqu’à leur congé, les patients hospitalisés pour des interventions chirurgicales dans 8 centres de CSA/CGSU achalandés de divers endroits au Canada. On a également tenu compte des réadmissions dans les 30 jours. Les paramètres pré-, per- et postopératoires ont été enregistrés. Une méthodologie statistique standard a été appliquée. En tout, 601 patients de CSA/CGSU ont ainsi été suivis pendant une durée allant jusqu’à 30 jours d’hospitalisation ou de réadmission après leur intervention urgente initiale. Cinquante et un pour cent étaient de sexe féminin et l’âge moyen était de 51 ans. Ces patients étaient nombreux à présenter des comorbidités de nature médicale substantielles (42 %) et une obésité morbide (15 %). La majorité des interventions ont été minimalement effractives (66 % laparoscopiques). La durée médiane des séjours a été de 3,3 jours et le taux de réadmission précoce (< 30 j) a été de 6 %. Six pour cent des patients ont été admis aux soins intensifs. Les taux globaux de complications et de mortalité ont été respectivement de 34 % et de 2 %. Cholécystite (31 %), appendicite (21 %), obstruction intestinale (18 %), hernie incarcérée (12 %), hémorragie digestive (7 %) et infections des tissus mous (7 %) comptent parmi les diagnostics les plus fréquents. Les taux de morbidité et de mortalité dans les cas de chirurgies ouvertes ont été respectivement de 73 % et 5 %. Les interventions de CSA/CGSU non liées à la traumatologie sont associées à un taux de morbidité postopératoire élevé. Cette étude fournira un ensemble de valeurs de références pour l’étude prospective des complications chez les patients pris en charge par les services de CSA/CGSU et l’amélioration subséquente des soins partout au Canada."

Outcomes were compared between the EGS registry and NSQIP abstracted cases. In 2016, the EGS registry identified 11/112 (9.8%) patients with a complication. National Surgical Quality Improvement Program abstracted 16% of EGS cases with 16.7% (3/18) of patients having a complication. In 2017, the EGS registry identified 10/87 (11.5%) cases with complications. National Surgical Quality Improvement Program abstracted 23% of EGS with zero complications. In 2018, the EGS registry identified 9.5% of 74 cases with complications. National Surgical Quality Improvement Program abstracted 15% of EGS cases with zero complications. National Surgical Quality Improvement Program did not capture many important EGS outcomes. In 2 of 3 years, NSQIP did not identify a single complication for EGS.

We sought to prospectively validate ESS, specifically in the high-risk nontrauma emergency laparotomy (EL) patient. This is an Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma multicenter prospective observational study. Between April 2018 and June 2019, 19 centers enrolled all adults (aged >18 years) undergoing EL. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were prospectively and systematically collected. Emergency Surgery Score was calculated for each patient and validated using c-statistic methodology by correlating it with three postoperative outcomes: (1) 30-day mortality, (2) 30-day complications (e.g., respiratory/renal failure, infection), and (3) postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) admission. A total of 1,649 patients were included. The mean age was 60.5 years, 50.3% were female, and 71.4% were white. The mean ESS was 6, and the most common indication for EL was hollow viscus perforation. The 30-day mortality and complication rates were 14.8% and 53.3%; 57.0% of patients required ICU admission. Emergency Surgery Score gradually and accurately predicted 30-day mortality; 3.5%, 50.0%, and 85.7% of patients with ESS of 3, 12, and 17 died after surgery, respectively, with a c-statistic of 0.84. Similarly, ESS gradually and accurately predicted complications; 21.0%, 57.1%, and 88.9% of patients with ESS of 1, 6, and 13 developed postoperative complications, with a c-statistic of 0.74. Emergency Surgery Score also accurately predicted which patients required intensive care unit admission (c-statistic, 0.80). This is the first prospective multicenter study to validate ESS as an accurate predictor of outcome in the EL patient. Emergency Surgery Score can prove useful for (1) perioperative patient and family counseling, (2) triaging patients to the intensive care unit, and (3) benchmarking the quality of emergency general surgery care.

Cases were defined as emergent if they were nonelective admissions with an operation occurring on hospital day 0 or 1. We used International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, code K63.2 (fistula of intestine) to identify postoperative fistula. We measured mortality rates and 30- and 90-day readmission rates censuring discharges occurring in December or from October to December, respectively. A total of 135,595 patients underwent emergency surgery; 1,470 (1.1%) developed ECF. Mortality was higher in EGS patients with ECF than in those without (10.1% vs. 5.4%; odds ratio [OR], 1.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.67-2.36) among patients who survived the index admission.

Similar increases were shown in elective GI surgery. Enterocutaneous fistula after GI EGS is associated with significantly increased odds of mortality and readmission, with rates continuing to climb out to at least 90 days. Processes of care designed to mitigate risk in this high-risk cohort should be developed. Prognostic and Epidemiological Study, Level III."

Methods This retrospective study evaluated patients requiring emergency surgery for abdominal trauma at a Level 1 Trauma Center over 30 years (1980-2010). Special attention was given to patients with concomitant genitourinary (GU) injuries. Results Of 1105 patients requiring an emergency laparotomy for trauma, 242 (22%) had urologic injuries including kidney 178 (16%), ureter 47 (4%), and bladder 46 (4%). Of the 242 patients, 50 (20%) died early (<48 hours) and 13 (5%) died later, primarily due to infection. A concept of \"seven deadly signs\" of hypoperfusion was developed. In patients with GU injuries, the presence of any deadly sign of hypoperfusion increased the mortality rate from 4% (6/152) to 63% (56/90), p<0.001. Of the 53 patients having a nephrectomy, 36 (68%) had one or more deadly signs and 27 (75%) died. Of 17 without deadly signs, only 2 (12%) died (p=0.001). Of 167 GU patients receiving blood, 59 (35%) developed infection vs 3/75(4%) in those receiving no blood (p<0.001). Conclusions The presence of deadly signs of severe injury and hypoperfusion on admission was the major factor determining mortality. With a severely injured kidney plus any deadly signs of hypoperfusion, special efforts should be made to avoid a nephrectomy."

Two hundred and twenty-seven patients met the inclusion criteria. An SAS of 1 or 2 accurately predicted risk of mortality (5.7% and 8.5% predicted versus 7.9% actual), whereas a risk adjustment of 3 indicated significant overestimation of mortality rate (14.8% predicted). There was good overall prediction performance for most variables with no clear preference for SAS 1, 2, or 3.

During the study, 2509 patients with acute abdomen presented. The majority of patients presenting were transferred from outside hospitals (n = 2097, 83.9%). Mortality was highest in patients with preoperative diagnosis of peritonitis (n = 119, 22.2%), bowel obstruction (n = 214, 18.7%), and volvuli (n = 51, 18.6%). There was no difference in mortality by year, p = 0.1. On multivariate Poisson regression, there was an increased relative risk of mortality with being transferred (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.12-1.55, p = 0.002), as well as undergoing an operation within 1-2 days (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.16-1.87, p < 0.001) and >2 days (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.17-1.82, p = 0.001) after presentation. The majority of patients in our study who presented with an acute abdomen were transferred from district hospitals, which resulted in high mortality due to delays in surgical care. Therefore, the WHO's recommendation that the majority of district hospitals perform the Bellwether procedures does not occur in district hospitals in central Malawi. District hospitals require significant resource investment to reduce transfers needs and patient mortality."

    "abstract": "Transfusion of red blood cells (RBC) increases morbidity and mortality, and emergency general surgery (EGS) cases have increased risk for transfusion and complication given case complexity and patient acuity. Transfusion reduction strategies and blood-conservation technology have been developed to decrease transfusions. This study explores whether transfusion rates in EGS have decreased as these new strategies have been implemented. This is a retrospective review of the American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) data from three academic medical centers. Operations performed by general surgeons on adults (aged ≥18 years) were selected. Data were analyzed from two periods: 2011-2013 and 2014-2016. Cases were grouped by the first four digits of the primary procedure Current Procedural Terminology code. Transfusion was defined as any RBC transfusion during or within 72 hours following the operation. Composite morbidity was defined as any NSQIP complication within 30 days following the operation. Overall general surgery transfusion rates decreased from 6.4% to 4.8% from period 1 to period 2 (emergent: 16.6%-11.5%; non-emergent 4.9%-3.7%; Fisher's exact p values <0.001). Among patients transfused, the number of units received decreased slightly (median 2 U (IQR 2-3) to median 2 U (IQR 1-3), Mann-Whitney U test p=0.005). Morbidity decreased (overall: 13.8%-12.3%, p=0.001; emergent: 26.3%-20.6%, p<0.001) while mortality did not change. Rates of RBC transfusion decreased in both emergent and non-emergent cases. Efforts to reduce transfusion may have been successful in the EGS population. Morbidity improved over the time periods while mortality was unchanged. Level III."

    "abstract": "Changes in care providers and hospitals after emergency general surgery (EGS) (care discontinuity) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The cause of these worse outcomes is unknown. Our goal was to determine if hospital quality is associated with mortality after readmissions independent of continuity in care. This was a retrospective analysis of Medicare inpatient claims (2007 to 2015). All inpatients older than 65 years of age who underwent 1 of 7 EGS procedures shown to represent 80% of EGS volume, complications, and mortality nationally, were included. Care discontinuity was defined as readmission within 30 days to a nonindex hospital. Hospital quality was determined by hospital-level, risk-adjusted mortality rates by EGS procedure and categorized into high quality (HQ) and low quality (LQ). The primary outcome was overall mortality. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association of discontinuity and mortality. There were 882,929 EGS patients, 87,232 of whom were readmitted within 30 days of discharge. Care discontinuity was independently associated with mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.23; 95% CI 1.17 to 1.29). When readmitted patients were stratified by quality of index and readmitting hospital, mortality was associated with the quality of both the index hospital and the readmitting hospital. The highest mortality rate was observed in patients with index admission at low-quality hospitals and readmission to a different low-quality hospital. Both care discontinuity and hospital quality are independently associated with mortality in EGS patients. These data support maintaining continuity of care, even at low performing hospitals."

To address these issues, the Regional Hospital Vicente Corral Moscoso adapted and implemented a model of \"trauma and acute care surgery\" (TACS) to the reality of Cuenca, Ecuador. A cohort study was carried out, comparing patients exposed to the traditional model and patients exposed to the TACS model. Variables assessed included number of surgical patients attended to in the emergency department, number of surgical interventions, number of surgeries performed per surgeon, surgical wait time, length of stay and in-hospital mortality. The total number of surgical interventions increased (3919.6-5745.8, p ≤ 0.05); by extension, the total number of surgeries performed per surgeon also increased (5.37-223.68, p ≤ 0.05). We observed a statistically significant decrease in surgical wait time (10.6-3.2 h for emergency general surgery, 6.3-1.6 h for trauma, p ≤ 0.05). Length of stay decreased in trauma patients (9-6 days, p ≤ 0.05). Higher mortality was found in the traditional model (p ≤ 0.05) compared to the TACS model. The implementation of TACS model in a resource-restrained hospital in Latin America had a positive impact by decreasing surgical waiting time in trauma and emergency surgery patients and length of stay in trauma patients. We also noted a statistically significant decrease in mortality. Savings to the overall system and patients can be inferred by decreased mortality, length of stay and surgical wait times. To our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a TACS model described in Latin America."

We undertook this study to identify the rate of symptomatic VTE for patients undergoing EGS operations. We conducted a retrospective cohort study evaluating EGS patients who underwent operative intervention between March and December 2014. Data collected included patient demographics, type of procedure, risk of VTE, VTE prophylaxis, development of symptomatic VTE, and mortality. We included 767 patients in our analysis. The mean age was 53 ± 19.7 years, and 52.2% of patients were female. Eighteen patients (2.3%) experienced VTE in hospital and 12 (1.6%) experienced VTE after discharge. Only 66% of patients received appropriate VTE prophylaxis. High-risk patients had a higher VTE rate (7.4% v. 2.3%, p < 0.001) and higher mortality (17.6% v. 4.0%, p < 0.001) than lowto moderate-risk patients.

We sought to assess whether ESS can accurately predict 30-day morbidity, mortality, and requirement for postoperative Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care in patients with missing data variables. All EGS patients with one or more missing ESS variables in the 2007-2015 ACS-NSQIP database were included. ESS was calculated assuming that a missing variable is normal (i.e. no additional ESS points). The correlation between ESS and morbidity, mortality, and postoperative ICU level of care was assessed using the c-statistics methodology. Out of a total of 4,456,809 patients, 359,849 were EGS, and of those 256,278 (71.2%) patients had at least one ESS variable missing. ESS correlated extremely well with mortality (c-statistic = 0.94) and postoperative requirement of ICU care (c-statistic = 0.91) and well with morbidity (c-statistic = 0.77). ESS performs well in predicting outcomes in EGS patients even when one or more data elements are missing and remains a useful bedside tool for counseling EGS patients and for benchmarking the quality of EGS care."

    "abstract": "The prevalence of delirium and its impact on outcomes after emergency general surgery (EGS) remain unexplored. The aims of our study were to assess the impact of frailty on delirium and the impact of delirium on outcomes in geriatric EGS patients. We performed a 1-year (2017) prospective cohort analysis of all geriatric (age ≥ 65 years) patients who underwent EGS. Frailty was calculated using the Emergency General Surgery-Specific Frailty Index (ESFI). Delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). Patients were dichotomized as delirious or non-delirious. We performed regression analysis controlling for demographics, admission vitals, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, comorbidity, and the diagnosis and type of surgery. A total of 163 patients underwent emergency general surgery and were included. Mean age was 71 ± 7 years, and 59% were male. Overall, the incidence of postoperative delirium was 26%. Patients who developed postoperative delirium were more likely to be frail (40% vs 14%, p < 0.01), on more than 3 medications (29% vs 18%, p < 0.01), and were more likely to have 3 or more comorbidities (32% vs 21%, p < 0.01). On regression analysis, frail status (odds ratio [OR] 3.7 [2.4-4.2], p < 0.01) and receiving more than 3 medications (OR 1.3 [range 1.1-1.4], p < 0.01) were independent predictors of developing postoperative delirium. An episode of delirium was associated with longer hospital length of stay (LOS) (6 days vs 3 days, p < 0.01), higher odds of ICU admission (OR 2 [1.3-4.5], p < 0.01), longer ICU LOS (2 days vs 1 day, p < 0.01), and higher odds of unplanned intubation (OR 1.8 [1.2-3.4], p < 0.01). The incidence of delirium after EGS was 26%. Frailty and polypharmacy were associated with increased risk of delirium. Delirium appears to be associated with higher rates of in-hospital adverse events."

There were 1,518 predictions of LOS. LOS predictions were rarely correct (TEGS team: 30.7% all patients, 35.6% surgical; NSQIP: 33.0% surgical). No individual group nor NSQIP was significantly better at predicting LOS. Inaccurate predictions were associated with female patients, longer LOS, trauma, frailty, higher comorbidity and injury severity scores, and lesser disposition.

    "title": "Failure to Rescue in Emergency Surgery: Is Precedence a Problem?",
    "abstract": "Mortality in emergency general surgery (EGS) is often attributed to patient condition, which may obscure opportunities for improvement in care. Identifying failure to rescue (FTR), or death after complication, may reveal these opportunities. FTR has been problematic in trauma secondary to low precedence rates (proportion of deaths preceded by complication). We sought to evaluate this in EGS, hypothesizing that precedence is lower in EGS than in similar elective operations. National Inpatient Sample data from January 2014 through September 2015 were used. 150,027 adult operative EGS complete cases were defined by emergent admission, one of seven International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9) procedure group codes for common EGS operations, and timing to operation (<48 h); these represent 750,135 patients under the National Inpatient Sample sampling design. Deaths were precedented if one of eight prespecified complications was identified. Chi-squared tests were used to compare precedence rates between selected emergent and elective operations. There was a 2.5% mortality rate in this cohort of operative EGS patients, with an 84.1% (95% CI: 82.7%-85.4%) precedence rate. Among the seven listed procedure groups, those with clinically reasonable elective analogs were cholecystectomy, colon resection, and laparotomy. Emergent versus elective precedence rates were 90.2% versus 82.0% (P = 0.004) for colon resection, 81.3% versus 86.8% (P = 0.26) for cholecystectomy, and 68.8% versus 92.7% (P < 0.001) for laparotomy. Precedence rates in EGS were higher than expected and were similar to previously published rates in nonemergent surgery, suggesting that FTR is likely to be reliable using standard methodology. Management of complications after emergency operation may represent significant opportunities to prevent mortality."

    "abstract": "Fournier gangrene (FG) is a genitourinary necrotizing fasciitis that can be lethal if not promptly diagnosed and surgically debrided. The diagnosis is often made by physical examination paired with an appropriate clinical suspicion and supporting laboratory values. Imaging, particularly computed tomography (CT), plays a role in delineating involved fascial planes for operative debridement and occasionally in diagnosing FG. Less commonly, the imaging manifestations of FG may also be seen on ultrasound, radiographs, and magnetic resonance imaging. With the ubiquitous use and availability of CT, radiologists have a growing role in recognizing FG. This can be challenging in the absence of fascial gas, but a CT scoring system for necrotizing fasciitis can be helpful in making the diagnosis. Recent series suggest that this predominantly male disease has a rising incidence in women. Women with FG are more likely to be morbidly obese and have vulvar or labial involvement compared to men. Imaging mimics include ulcerative and necrotic tumors, traumatic or iatrogenic fascial gas, and vaginitis emphysematosa. The purpose of this pictorial review is to illustrate the imaging manifestations of FG and its mimics, with emphases on necrotizing fasciitis CT scoring systems and FG in women."

This prospective, nonrandomized, controlled before-and-after study included patients 65 years or older who presented to the emergency general surgery service of 2 tertiary care hospitals in Alberta, Canada. Transfers from other medical services, patients undergoing elective surgery or with trauma, and nursing home residents were excluded. Of 6795 patients screened, a total of 684 (544 in the nonintervention group and 140 in the intervention group) were included.

Proportion of participants experiencing a major complication or death (composite) in the hospital, Comprehensive Complication Index, length of hospital stay, and proportion of participants who required an alternative level of care on discharge. Covariate-adjusted, within-site change scores were computed, and the overall between-site, preintervention-postintervention difference-in-differences (DID) were analyzed. A total of 684 patients were included in the analysis (mean [SD] age, 76.0 [7.6] years; 327 women [47.8%] and 357 men [52.2%]), of whom 139 (20.3%) were frail. At the intervention site, in-hospital major complications or death decreased by 19% (51 of 153 [33.3%] vs 19 of 140 [13.6%]; P < .001; DID P = .06), and mean (SE) Comprehensive Complication Index decreased by 12.2 (2.5) points (P < .001; DID P < .001).

Acute care hospitals. Patients 65 years or older who received one of the five EGS procedures with the highest mortality burden (partial colectomy, small bowel resection, peptic ulcer disease repair, adhesiolysis, or laparotomy). A validated claims-based frailty index (CFI) identified patients who were not frail (CFI < .15), pre-frail (.15 ≤ CFI < .25), mildly frail (.25 ≤ CFI < .35), and moderately to severely frail (CFI ≥ .35). Multivariable Cox regression compared 1-year mortality. Multivariable Poisson regression compared rates of post-discharge hospital encounters (hospitalizations, intensive care unit stay, emergency department visit) and home time over 1 year after discharge. All regression models adjusted for age, sex, race, admission from facility, procedure, sepsis, inpatient palliative care delivery, trauma center designation, hospital bed size, and teaching status, and they were clustered by patient and hospital referral region. Among 468 459 older EGS adults, 37.4% were pre-frail, 12.4% were mildly frail, and 3.6% were moderately to severely frail. Patients with mild frailty experienced a higher risk of 1-year mortality compared with non-frail patients (hazard ratio = 1.97; confidence interval [CI] = 1.94-2.01).

    "abstract": "Efforts to improve health care value (quality/cost) have become a priority in the United States. Although many seek to increase quality by reducing variability in adverse outcomes, less is known about variability in costs. In conjunction with the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Healthcare Economics Committee, the objective of this study was to examine the extent of variability in total hospital costs for two common procedures: laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Nationally weighted data for adults 18 years and older was obtained for patients undergoing each operation in the 2014 and 2016 National Inpatient Sample. Data were aggregated at the hospital-level to attain hospital-specific median index hospital costs in 2019 US dollars and corresponding annual procedure volumes. Cost variation was assessed using caterpillar plots and risk-standardized observed/expected cost ratios. Correlation analysis, variance decomposition, and regression analysis explored costs' association with volume. In 2016, 1,563 hospitals representing 86,170 LA and 2,276 hospitals representing 230,120 LC met the inclusion criteria. In 2014, the numbers were similar (1,602 and 2,259 hospitals). Compared with a mean of US $10,202, LA median costs ranged from US $2,850 to US $33,381. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy median costs ranged from US $4,406 to US $40,585 with a mean of US $12,567. Differences in cost strongly associated with procedure volume. Volume accounted for 9.9% (LA) and 12.4% (LC) of variation between hospitals, after controlling for the influence of other hospital (8.2% and 5.0%) and patient (6.3% and 3.7%) characteristics and in-hospital complications (0.8% and 0.4%). Counterfactual modeling suggests that were all hospitals to have performed at or below their expected median cost, one would see a national cost savings of greater than US $301.9 million per year (95% confidence interval, US $280.6-325.5 million). Marked variability of median hospital costs for common operations exists. Differences remained consistent across changing coding structures and database years and were strongly associated with volume. Taken together, the findings suggest room for improvement in emergency general surgery and a need to address large discrepancies in an often-overlooked aspect of value. Epidemiological, level III."

    "abstract": "The American College of Surgeons maintains that surgical care in the US has not reached optimal safety and quality. This can be driven partially by higher-risk, emergency operations in geriatric patients. We therefore sought to answer 2 questions: First, to what degree does standardized postoperative mortality vary in hospitals performing nonelective operations in geriatric patients? Second, can the differences in hospital-based mortality be explained by patient-, operative-, and hospital-level characteristics among outlier institutions? Patients 65 years and older who underwent 1 of 8 common emergency general surgery operations were identified using the California State Inpatient Database (2010 to 2011). Expected mortality was obtained from hierarchical, Bayesian mixed-effects logistic regression models. A risk-adjusted hospital-level standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated from observed-to-expected in-hospital deaths. \"Outlier\" hospitals had an SMR 80% CI that did not cross the mean SMR of 1.0. High-mortality (SMR >1.0) and low-mortality (SMR <1.0) outliers were compared. We included 24,207 patients from 107 hospitals. SMRs varied widely, from 2.3 (highest) to 0.3 (lowest). Eleven hospitals (10.3%) were poor-performing high-SMR outliers, and 10 hospitals (9.3%) were exceptional-performing low-SMR outliers. SMR was 3 times worse in the high-SMR compared with the low-SMR group (1.7 vs 0.6; p < 0.001). Patient-, operation-, and hospital-level characteristics were equivalent among outlier-hospitals. Significant hospital variation exists in standardized mortality after common general surgery operations done emergently in older patients. More than 10% of institutions have substantial excess mortality. These findings confirm that the safety of emergency operation in geriatric patients can be significantly improved by decreasing the wide variability in mortality outcomes."

    "title": "Readmission after emergency general surgery.",
    "abstract": "Readmission rates are an important metric because they enable an evaluation of care and affect Medicare funding. This study evaluates factors contributing to readmission after emergency general surgery. The Virginia Health Information database was used to identify patients who had undergone the most common emergency general surgery procedures from 1/2011-6/2016. Analyses were performed for 30 and 90-day readmission. 121,223 records met initial inclusion criteria and 54,372 remained after exclusions. In 30 days there were 5050 readmissions and 7896 readmissions in 90 days. Factors significant in contributing to 30-day readmission were length of stay, discharge location, and several comorbidities. For 90-day readmission the same factors were significant with the addition of urgent vs emergency admission and insurance status as well as additional comorbidities. Discharge to rehab, SNF, or with home healthcare had particularly high rates of 90 day readmission. We identified factors that contribute to readmission after emergency general surgery providing targets for future interventions. Improved follow up for patients discharged with rehab or home health needs is our next step."

    "title": "Current practice of anticoagulant in the treatment of splanchnic vein thrombosis secondary to acute pancreatitis.",
    "abstract": "Severe acute pancreatitis is a common diagnosis in emergency general surgery and can be a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. A consequence of severe acute pancreatitis is thrombus in the splanchnic veins. These thrombi can potentially lead to bowel ischemia or hepatic failure. However, another complication of severe acute pancreatitis is retroperitoneal bleeding. At this time, it is unclear if treating patients for splanchnic vein thrombosis in the context of severe acute pancreatitis is associated with any outcome benefit. A systematic review might clarify this question. A two-fold search strategy (one broad and one precise) looked at all published literature. The review was registered on PROSPERO (ID: CRD42018102705). MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane and Web of Science databases were searched and potentially relevant papers were reviewed independently by two researchers. Any disagreement was reviewed by a third independent researcher. Primary outcome was reestablishment of flow in the thrombosed vein versus bleeding complications. Of 1462 papers assessed, a total of 16 papers were eligible for inclusion. There were no randomized controlled trials, 2 were case series, 5 retrospective single-center studies and 9 case reports. There were a total of 198 patients in these studies of whom 92 (46.5%) received anticoagulation therapy. The rates of recanalization of veins in the treated and non-treated groups was 14% and 11% and bleeding complications were 16% and 5%, respectively. However, the included studies were too heterogeneous to undertake a meta-analysis. The systematic review highlights the lack evidence addressing this clinical question. Therefore a randomized controlled trial would be appropriate to undertake."

    "abstract": "Access to timely and safe emergency general surgery remains a challenge in sub-Saharan Africa due to issues such as insufficient human capacity and infrastructure. This study has the following objectives: (1) to compare the actual time to surgery (aTTS) to the ideal time to surgery among patients undergoing emergency surgery and (2) to explore the use of home to emergency department time (HET) as a new measurement indicator for time from symptoms onset to admission at ED at a referral hospital. We performed a retrospective review of emergency general surgery cases performed at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Kigali in Rwanda between June 1 and November 31, 2016. Our primary outcomes included actual time to surgery (aTTS) in hours (defined as time from admission at ED to induction of anesthesia) and actual home to emergency department (ED) time (aHET) in days (defined as time from onset of symptoms to admission at ED). Our secondary outcome was the overall in-hospital mortality rate. During the study period, 148 emergency surgeries were performed. Most of the patients were male (80%), aged between 15 and 65 (69%), from outside Kigali (72%), and with insurance (80%). The most common diagnosis was abdominal trauma (24%), followed by peritonitis (20%), and intestinal obstruction (16%). The median aTTS was 7.8 h, and the median aHET was 2.43 days. Most patients (77%) experienced delays in timely surgery after admission to ED, and aTTS was 15.5 h for Fournier's gangrene, 10.8 h for abdominal trauma, 11.3 h for appendicitis, 10.5 h for intestinal obstructions, and 12.3 h for peritonitis. Likewise, most patients (52%) experienced delays in reaching the ED, especially those with appendicitis (15.2 days), peritonitis (8.5 days), testicular torsion (7.2 days), Fournier's gangrene (5 days), and intestinal obstruction (3.7 days). The case fatality rate by diagnosis was highest for polytrauma (100%) and peritonitis (60%); the overall in-hospital mortality rate was 23%. Some of the poor outcomes associated with in-hospital delay include reoperation and death. Factors to consider in triage for referral include age, diagnosis, and high risk of death. Our study found that the median aTTS was 7.8 h and most patients (77%) were delayed in having timely surgery after admission at ED. In addition, the median aHET was 2.5 days and most patients (52%) were delayed in reaching the ED. Improving processes to facilitate access and to perform timely emergency surgery through the referral system has a potential to decrease delay and improve outcomes."

    "abstract": "People 65 years and older represent the fastest growing segment of the surgical population. Older age is associated with doubling of risk when undergoing emergency general surgery (EGS) procedures and often coexists with medical complexity and considerations of end-of-life care, creating prognostic and decisional uncertainty. Combined with the time-sensitive nature of EGS, it is challenging to gauge perioperative risk and ensure that clinical decisions are aligned with the patient values. Current preoperative risk prediction models for older EGS patients have major limitations regarding derivation and validation, and do not address the specific risk profile of older patients. Accurate and externally validated models specific to older patients are needed to inform care and decision making. We will derive, internally and externally validate a multivariable model to predict 30-day mortality in EGS patients >65 years old. Our derivation sample will be individuals enrolled in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database between 2012 and 2016 having 1 of 7 core EGS procedures. Postulated predictor variables have been identified based on previous research, clinical and epidemiological knowledge. Our model will be derived using logistic regression penalised with elastic net regularisation and ensembled using bootstrap aggregation. The resulting model will be internally validated using k-fold cross-validation and bootstrap validation techniques and externally validated using population-based health administrative data. Discrimination and calibration will be reported at each step. Ethics for NSQIP data use was obtained from the Ottawa Hospital Research Ethics Board; external validation will use routinely collected anonymised data legally exempt from research ethics review. The final risk score will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. We plan to further disseminate the model as an online calculator or application for clinical use. Future research will be required to test the clinical application of the final model."

    "abstract": "Recent management of acute cholecystitis favors same admission (SA) or emergent cholecystectomy based on overall shorter hospital stay and therefore cost savings. We adopted the practice of SA cholecystectomy for the treatment of acute cholecystitis at our tertiary care center and wanted to evaluate the economic benefit of this practice. We hypothesized that the existence of complications, particularly among patients with a higher degree of disease severity, during SA cholecystectomy could negate the cost savings. To compare complication rates and hospital costs between SA vs delayed cholecystectomy among patients admitted emergently for acute cholecystitis. Under an IRB-approved protocol, complications and charges for were obtained for SA, later after conservative management (Delayed), or elective cholecystectomies over an 8.5-year period. Patients were identified using the acute care surgery registry and billing database. Data was retrieved via EMR, operative logs, and Revenue Cycle Operations. The severity of acute cholecystitis was graded according to the Tokyo Guidelines. TG18 categorizes acute cholecystitis by Grades 1, 2, and 3 representing mild, moderate, and severe, respectively. Comparisons were analyzed with χ 2, Fisher's exact test, ANOVA, t-tests, and logistic regression; significance was set at P < 0.05. Four hundred eighty-six (87.7%) underwent a SA while 68 patients (12.3%) received Delayed cholecystectomy. Complication rates were increased after SA compared to Delayed cholecystectomy (18.5% vs 4.4%, P = 0.004). The complication rates of patients undergoing delayed cholecystectomy was similar to the rate for elective cholecystectomy (7.4%, P = 0.35). Mortality rates were 0.6% vs 0% for SA vs Delayed. Patients with moderate disease (Tokyo 2) suffered more complications among SA while none who were delayed experienced a complication (16.1% vs 0.0%, P < 0.001). Total hospital charges for SA cholecystectomy were increased compared to a Delayed approach ($44500 ± $59000 vs $35300 ± $16700, P = 0.019). The relative risk of developing a complication was 4.2x [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.4-12.9] in the SA vs Delayed groups. Among eight patients (95%CI: 5.0-12.3) with acute cholecystitis undergoing SA cholecystectomy, one patient will suffer a complication. Patients with Tokyo Grade 2 acute cholecystitis had more complications and increased hospital charges when undergoing SA cholecystectomy. This data supports a selective approach to SA cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis."

    "abstract": "To calculate the current and projected financial burden of EGS hospital admissions in a single-payer healthcare system. EGS is an important acute care service, which demands significant healthcare resources. EGS admissions and associated costs have increased over time, associated with an aging demographic. The National Health Service is the sole provider of emergency care in Scotland. Principal, high and low Scottish population projections were obtained for 2016 until 2041. EGS admission data were projected using an ordinary least squares linear regression model. An exponential function, fitted to historical length of hospital stay (LOS) data, was used to project future LOS. Historical hospital unit cost per bed day was projected using a linear regression model. EGS cost was calculated to 2041 by multiplying annual projections of population, admission rates, LOS, and cost per bed day. The adult (age >15) Scottish population is projected to increase from 4.5 million to 4.8 million between 2016 and 2041. During this time, EGS admissions are expected to increase from 83,132 to 101,090 per year, cost per bed day from £786 to £1534, and overall EGS cost from £187.3 million to £202.5 million. The future financial burden of EGS in Scotland is projected to increase moderately between 2016 and 2041. This is in sharp contrast to previous studies from settings such as the United States. However, if no further reductions in LOS or cost per bed day are made, especially for elderly patients, the cost of EGS will rise dramatically."

    "abstract": "Patients undergoing emergency laparotomy are a heterogeneous group with regard to comorbidity, pre-operative physiological state and surgical pathology. There are many factors to consider in the peri-operative period for these patients. Surgical duration should be as short as possible for adequate completion of the procedure. This is of particular importance in the elderly and comorbid population. To date, there are limited data addressing the role of damage control surgery in emergency general surgery. Dual consultant-led care in all stages of emergency laparotomy care is increasing, with increased presence out of hours and also for high-risk patients. The role of the stoma care team should be actively encouraged in all patients who may require a stoma. Due to the emergent and unpredictable nature of surgical emergencies, healthcare teams may need to employ novel strategies to ensure early input from the stoma care team. It is important for all members of the medical teams to ensure that patients have given consent for both anaesthesia and surgery before emergency laparotomy. Small studies suggest that patients and their families are not aware of the high risk of morbidity and mortality following emergency laparotomy before operative intervention. Elderly patients should have early involvement from geriatric specialists and careful attention paid to assessment of frailty due to its association with mortality and morbidity. Additionally, the use of enhanced recovery programmes in emergency general surgery has been shown to have some impact in reducing length of stay in emergency surgical patients. However, the emergent nature of this surgery has been shown to be a detrimental factor in full implementation of enhanced recovery programmes. The use of a national database to collect data on patients undergoing emergency laparotomy and their processes of care has led to reduced mortality and length of stay in the UK. However, internationally, fewer data are available to draw conclusions."

Older adults have high rates of mortality and readmissions after EGS, yet little is known as to how these outcomes compare with acute medical conditions that have been targets for quality improvement. To examine whether Medicare beneficiaries who undergo EGS experience similar 1-year outcomes compared with patients admitted with acute medical conditions. This population-based, retrospective cohort study using Medicare claims data from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2014, included adults 65 years or older with at least 1 year of Medicare claims who had urgent or emergency admissions for 1 of the 5 highest-burden EGS procedures (partial colectomy, small-bowel resection, peptic ulcer disease surgery, lysis of adhesions, or laparotomy) or a primary diagnosis of an acute medical condition (pneumonia, heart failure, or acute myocardial infarction). Patients undergoing EGS and those with acute medical conditions were matched 1:1 in a 2-step algorithm: (1) exact match by hospital or (2) propensity score match with age, sex, race/ethnicity, Charlson Comorbidity Index, individual comorbid conditions, claims-based frailty index, year of admission, and any intensive care unit stay. Data analysis was performed from July 16, 2018, to November 13, 2019. Partial colectomy, small-bowel resection, peptic ulcer disease surgery, lysis of adhesions, or laparotomy or a primary diagnosis pneumonia, heart failure, or acute myocardial infarction. One-year mortality, postdischarge health care utilization (emergency department visit, additional hospitalization, intensive care unit stay, or total hospital encounters), and days at home during 1 year. A total of 481 417 matched pairs (mean [SD] age, 78.9 [7.8] years; 272 482 [56.6%] female) with adequate covariate balance were included in the study. Patients undergoing EGS experienced higher 30-day mortality (60 683 [12.6%] vs 56 713 [11.8%], P < .001) yet lower 1-year mortality (142 846 [29.7%] vs 158 385 [32.9%], P < .001) compared with medical patients. Among 409 363 pairs who survived discharge, medical patients experienced higher rates of total hospital encounters in the year after discharge (4 vs 3 per person-year; incidence rate ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.30-1.32) but had similar mean days at home compared with patients undergoing EGS (293 vs 309 days; incident rate ratio, 1.004; 95% CI, 1.004-1.004). In this study, older patients undergoing EGS had similarly high 1-year rates of mortality, hospital use, and days away from home as acutely ill medical patients. These findings suggest that EGS should also be targeted for national quality improvement programs."

    "abstract": "Few studies have assessed the relationship between different emergency general surgery models and staff satisfaction, operative experience or working hours. The Royal Australasian College of Surgeons recommends maximum on-call frequency of one-in-four for surgeons and registrars. A cross-sectional study was conducted of all medium- to major-sized Australian public hospitals offering elective general surgery. At each site, an on-call general surgery registrar and senior surgeon were invited to participate. Primary outcomes were staff satisfaction and registrar-perceived operative exposure. Secondary outcomes were working hours. Among eligible hospitals, 119/120 (99%) were enrolled. Compared with traditional emergency general surgery models, hybrid or acute surgical unit models were associated with greater surgeon and registrar satisfaction on quantitative (P = 0.012) and qualitative measures. Registrar-perceived operating exposure was unaffected by emergency general surgery model. Longest duration on-duty was higher among traditional structures for both registrars (mean 22 versus 15 h; P = 0.0003) and surgeons (mean 59 versus 41 h; P = 0.020). On-call frequency greater than one-in-four was more common in traditional structures for registrars (51% versus 28%; P = 0.012) but not surgeons (6% versus 0%; P = 0.089). Data on average hours per day off-duty were obtained for registrars only, and were lower in traditional structures (13 versus 15 h; P = 0.00002). Hybrid or acute surgical unit models may improve staff satisfaction without sacrificing perceived operative exposure. While average maximum duration on-duty exceeded hazardous thresholds for surgeons regardless of model, unsafe working hours for registrars were more common in traditional structures. General surgical departments should review on-call rostering to optimize staff and patient safety."

This controlled cohort evaluation assessed whether participation in a quality improvement collaborative approach reduced time to surgery for patients with acute gallstone disease to fewer than 8 days from presentation, in line with national guidance. Patients admitted to hospital with acute biliary conditions in England and Wales between 1 April 2014 and 31 December 2017 were identified from Hospital Episode Statistics data. Time series of quarterly activity were produced for the Cholecystectomy Quality Improvement Collaborative (Chole-QuIC) and all other acute National Health Service hospitals (control group). A negative binomial regression model was used to compare the proportion of patients having surgery within 8 days in the baseline and intervention periods. Of 13 sites invited to join Chole-QuIC, 12 participated throughout the collaborative, which ran from October 2016 to January 2018. Of 7944 admissions, 1160 patients had a cholecystectomy within 8 days of admission, a significant improvement (P < 0·050) from baseline performance. This represented a relative change of 1·56 (95 per cent c.i. 1·38 to 1·75), compared with 1·08 for the control group. At the individual site level, eight of the 12 Chole-QuIC sites showed a significant improvement (P < 0·050), with four sites increasing their 8-day surgery rate to over 20 per cent of all emergency admissions, well above the mean of 15·3 per cent for control hospitals. A surgeon-led quality improvement collaborative approach improved care for patients requiring emergency cholecystectomy.

The goal of this study is to investigate disparities in the treatment of cholecystitis based on insurance type and to identify contributing factors. Adults with cholecystitis at a safety-net hospital in Central Massachusetts from 2017-2018 were included. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were compared based on Medicaid enrollment status (Medicare excluded). Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to compare the frequency of surgery, time to surgery (TTS), length of stay (LOS), and readmission rates between groups. The sample (n = 203) included 69 Medicaid enrollees (34%), with a mean age of 44.4 years. Medicaid enrollees were younger (p = 0.0006), had lower levels of formal education (high school diploma attainment, p < 0.0001), were more likely to be unmarried (p < 0.0001), Non-White (p = 0.0012), and require an interpreter (p < 0.0001). Patients in both groups experienced similar rates of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, TTS, and LOS; however, Medicaid enrollees experienced more readmissions within 30 days of discharge (30.4% vs 17.9%, p < 0.001). Despite anticipated population differences, the treatment of acute cholecystitis was similar between Medicaid and Non-Medicaid enrollees, with the exception of readmission. Further research is needed to identify patient, provider, and/or population factors driving this disparity."

    "title": "Introduction.",
    "abstract": "There is no doubt that postgraduate education and all \"professional development activity\" is in crisis, not only in our country but in all of Europe. The crisis is on one hand due to a lack of resources which has been evident for more than a decade, and on the other hand due to factors such as organization, culture, and education. Many of the chief medical disciplines such as internal medicine or general surgery, have been literally crushed and replaced by a myriad of subspecialties that have undermined the original unified character of the main disciplines 1. The teaching regulations in recent years have significantly limited students' opportunities to have direct, practical experience with surgery, which would allow them to develop their abilities and a true vocation , both crucial for a profession such as surgery which requires specific qualities and skills. Moreover the new regulations regarding admission to residency programs do not require candidates to make a definitive decision up front about what they want to specialize in, but rather leads them to accept any position among those still available after the candidates who are higher on the national rank-order list, get first pick of all specialties. General surgery is not among the specialties that are most popular in Italy and this appears to be true all over the world. It is therefore one of the few specialties that candidates with a low ranking are allowed to enter, even if they have no natural affinity for this discipline and no special desire to become a general surgeon. This is detrimental not only for healthcare as a whole and patients in particular, but for those doctors who would have selected surgery as their first choice , but cannot because they are too far down on the rank-order list. As a result a significant number of surgeons in training will leave during the five-year training period or after obtaining their diploma or will dedicate themselves to parasurgical activities or specific subspecialties, losing in a short time the broader skills of general surgery and emergency surgery. At the same time the universities has neither the organizational capacity, nor the resources to ensure that all these new subspecialties have the same degree of status and funding. Consequently, the training offered in each subspecialty is currently dependent not on an organic strategy but on factors such as problems with funding and administration, support from the medical industry, or, or even temporary appeal The crisis of training in emergency surgery is paradigmatic probably due to all of the above factors. The lack of foresight of the European institutions in charge has unfortunately had an completely negative influence on this discipline. While general surgery was imploding, the increase in the average age, the evolution of mechanization, the logistics of both work and pleasure, and the explosion of home automation, has dramatically increased the number of both trauma and non-trauma emergencies, increasing the need for professionals with specific cultural and technical skills. Coping with of surgical emergencies accounts for up to 50% of all surgical activity , but in Europe training in Emergency surgery, the only surgical discipline that still maintains the scientific, clinical, technical, and organizational knowledge and skills of general surgery, has been reduced to a bare minimum This affects morbidity and mortality rates, leading to a considerable increase in hospital costs 2. Our English colleagues put a spotlight on this problem some time ago, highlighting the professional and existential problems of surgeons who do not feel able to adequately manage any type of surgical emergency. They therefore demand on the one hand more effective technical training and on the other hand that emergency surgery be reserved only for specialists in the sector. But who will train them if residency programs in emergency surgery have been eliminated and have not been replaced, as they have, by training courses such as \"Acute Care Surgery\" Thanks to the attitude of national and continental institutions, the number and quality of training opportunities continues to decline Recently, the European Working Time Directive(EWTD) has been introduced, reducing by 50% the time that both tutors and residents could devote to professional activities (3), As a result, for some time now, public and private institutions, cultural and professional associations, trade union representatives, specialty organizations, scientific societies and whatever else, have been proposing and organizing events of all kinds: theoretical and practical courses, Masters programs, single-theme seminars, continuing medical education events, distance learning courses, Technical training live or on the simulator, Cadaver labs and so on, many of which have increased the financial burden on the individual doctor. The Royal College of Surgeons, calculated that the cost of completing the post-university requirements in surgery is today on average about £ 3360 (with a range of $2735 - 20780) compared to £2815 for internal medicine and £ 2215 for anesthesiology .This contributes significantly in increasing young doctors' loss of interest in this specialty. In particular, this applies to emergency surgery because of the poor quality of life , wage limitations, increased responsibilities, and legal disputes associated with this discipline4 . We feel that scientific societies must attempt to compensate for the deficits of institutional education by producing and supplying qualified products at a low price. In recent years various, chiefly Anglo-Saxon societies have proposed live courses on trauma surgery such as the ATOM and DSCT and practical theoretical courses on the first approach to patients requiring emergency care. AEMS has planned theoretical courses in emergency surgery aimed in particular at the acquisition of a European certificate of professional competence and qualification in emergency surgery and ESTES has done the same with regard to professional development in specific diagnostic and therapeutic emergency procedures 5. The Italian Society of Emergency Surgery and Trauma (SICUT), after having validated and proposed in Italy the best English-speaking products and having directly imported the DSCT, began its own production of residential events and dedicated education proposals addressed in particular to the young surgeons. The current symposium consists of a series of short presentations of the various training initiatives for the professional development of emergency surgical care staff that the SICUT has organized in the last few years . This is a series of educational and training events of different kinds, many of which are produced in partnership with other organizations, dedicated to surgeons willing to implement or renew their knowledge and technical skills."

    "abstract": "Although emergency surgery accounts for 50% of the surgery cases in hospitals in Italy, in 57% of the hospitals emergency surgery is not performed by a dedicated team. In Europe, numerous surveys have shown that 50% of the young surgeons desire a more complete training in emergency general surgery (EGS). A survey conducted by the Association of Surgeons in training in the UK has shown that trainees want greater competence in EGS (92.4%) through the adoption of specific programs and training protocols. The Italian Society of Emergency Surgery and Trauma (SICUT)) has decided to try to make up for this lack of training by organizing specific courses that can serve as a training pathway in EGS. KEY WORDS: Emergency Surgery, Training. Benchè la chirurgia d’urgenza rappresenti il 50% dell’attività chirurgica degli ospedali, il 57% di essi in Italia non ha un team dedicato per la chirurgia d’urgenza. In Europa numerose survey hanno mostrato che il 50% dei giovani chirurghi in attività avrebbe desiderato una formazione specifica più completa e più adeguatamente professionalizzante in EGS. Una survey condotta dalla Associazione dei Chirurghi in formazione in UK ha dimostrato che la richiesta degli specializzandi è verso una maggiore competenza in EGS (92,4%) attraverso l’inserimento di programmi specifici nel percorso formativo. La SICUT (Società Italiana di Chirurgia d’Urgenza e del Trauma) ha cercato di sopperire a tale carenza formativa con l’organizzazione di Corsi che possano rappresentare un percorso formativo costante in EGS."

    "title": "An Analysis of the Decision-Making Process After \"Decision not to Operate\" in Acutely Unwell, High-Risk General Surgery Patients.",
    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to analyze the decision-making process in emergency general surgery in an attempt to ascertain whether surgeons make the correct decision when decisions not to operate in high-risk acutely unwell surgical patients are taken. A decision not to operate is sometimes associated with a certain degree of uncertainty as to the accuracy of the decision. Difficulty lies with the fact that the decisions are made on assumptions, and the tools available are not fool proof. We retrospectively evaluated \"decisions not to operate\" over a period of 32 months from April 2013 to August 2015 in a district general hospital in United Kingdom and compared with consecutive similar number of patients who had an operation as recorded in the National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA) database (from January 2014 to August 2015). We looked at the demographics, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, Portsmouth-Physiological and Operative Severity Score for enumeration of Mortality and Morbidity (P-POSSUM) score, functional status, and 30-day mortality. Two groups (operated [n = 43] and conservative [n = 42]) had similar characteristics. Patients for conservative management had a higher P-POSSUM score (P < .001) and a poorer functional status (P < .001) at the time of decision-making compared to those who had surgery. Mortality at 30 days was significantly higher for patients decided for conservative management when compared with those who had surgery (76.2% and 18.6%, respectively). Elderly patients with poorer functional status and predicted risks more often drive multidisciplinary discussions on whether to operate. Within the limitations of not knowing the outcome otherwise, it appears surgeons take a reasonable approach when deciding not to operate."

    "abstract": "It has been theorized that a tiered, regionalized system of care for emergency general surgery (EGS) patients-akin to regional trauma systems-would translate into significant survival benefits. Yet data to support this supposition are lacking. The aim of this study was to determine the potential number of lives that could be saved by regionalizing EGS care to higher-volume, lower-mortality EGS institutions. Adult patients who underwent one of 10 common EGS operations were identified in the California Inpatient Database (2010-2011). An algorithm was constructed that \"closed\" lower-volume, higher-mortality hospitals and referred those patients to higher-volume, lower-mortality institutions (\"closure\" based on hospital EGS volume-threshold that optimized to 95% probability of survival). Primary outcome was the number of lives saved. Fifty thousand regionalization simulations were completed (5,000 for each operation) employing a bootstrap resampling method to proportionally redistribute patients. Estimates of expected deaths at the higher-volume hospitals were recalculated for every bootstrapped sample. Of the 165,123 patients who underwent EGS operations over the 2-year period, 17,655 (10.7%) were regionalized to a higher-volume hospital. On average, 128 (48.8%) of lower-volume hospitals were \"closed,\" ranging from 68 (22.0%) hospital closures for appendectomy to 205 (73.2%) for small bowel resection. The simulations demonstrated that EGS regionalization would prevent 9.7% of risk-adjusted EGS deaths, significantly saving lives for every EGS operation: from 30.8 (6.5%) deaths prevented for appendectomy to 122.8 (7.9%) for colectomy. Regionalization prevented 4.6 deaths per 100 EGS patient-transfers, ranging from 1.3 for appendectomy to 8.0 for umbilical hernia repair. This simulation study provides important new insight into the concept of EGS regionalization, suggesting that 1 in 10 risk-adjusted deaths could be prevented by a structured system of EGS care. Future work should expand upon these findings using more complex discrete-event simulation models. Therapeutic/Care Management, level IV."

    "abstract": "We hypothesized that patients living in rural neighborhoods experience delayed access to surgical services manifesting in increased appendiceal perforation rates in cases of appendicitis. This population-based cohort study included adult patients with acute appendicitis in Canada (excluding Quebec) between April 2008 and March 2015. The main outcome of interest was rate of perforation. Predictors of interest included socioeconomic, geographic, and individual predictors of perforation. Spatial analysis was used to analyze spatial clustering of perforation. We identified 143,195 patients throughout the course of the study. The average perforation rate across our study was 35.9% (n = 51,456). Cluster analysis identified 286 (24%) neighborhoods with perforation rates greater than the average. Rural neighborhoods had a 1.89 times higher odds of being in a high perforation cluster (95% CI 1.08-3.08, p = 0.024). Compared to neighborhoods > 75 km from the admitting hospital, closer neighborhoods were less likely to be in a high perforation cluster (0-35 km OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.38-0.98, p = 0.049; 36-75 km OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37-0.92, p = 0.019). Patients admitted to small community hospitals had a 0.51 times lower odds of perforation than those admitted to academic centers (95% CI 0.47-0.54, p < 0.001) and those who lived in high perforation clusters had a 1.42 times higher odds of perforation (95% CI 1.39-1.46, p < 0.001). Neighborhoods located far from hospitals have increased appendiceal perforation rates. Also, patients with appendicitis treated at small community hospitals have significantly lower odds of perforation. From a policy point of view, patients with symptoms of appendicitis can be safely treated at the nearest hospital."

    "abstract": "Frailty has been increasingly recognized as a modifiable risk factor prior to elective general surgery. There is limited evidence regarding the association of frailty with perioperative outcomes after specific emergency general surgery procedures. A retrospective cohort study of 57,173 patients older than 40 y of age from 2010 to 2014 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program underwent appendectomy, cholecystectomy, large bowel resection, small bowel resection, or nonbowel resection (lysis of adhesion, ileostomy creation) on an emergent basis. Preoperative modified frailty index (mFI) was determined for each patient and was used in a multivariable logistic regression to determine the association with perioperative morbidity, mortality, and discharge destination. A total of 57,173 patients (46% men, mean [SD] age 60 [13] y) underwent an emergency appendectomy (n = 26,067), cholecystectomy (n = 8138), large bowel resection (n = 12,107), small bowel resection (n = 6503), or nonbowel resection (n = 4358). Among them, 14,300 (25.0%) experienced any perioperative complication, and 12,668 (22.2%) experienced a serious complication with an overall 30-d mortality of 5.1%. Highly frail patients had a 30-d mortality of 19.0% across all five operations. In multivariable analysis, mFI was associated with any complication and 30-d mortality in a step-wise fashion for each emergency operation. Intermediate and high mFI were also inversely associated with discharge home for each operation. Frailty is associated with increased perioperative morbidity and mortality in common emergency general surgery operations. Frailty should be assessed by surgeons to inform decisions on operative intervention and to inform patients/families on expected outcomes."

Pre-operative delays are associated with longer length of stay, higher costs and post-operative complications. Calculate time to theatre (TTT) from admission to appendicectomy and investigate factors impacting TTT. A retrospective review of all emergency appendicectomies from June 2017 to October 2018. Demographic, clinico-pathological and radiological data were extracted from electronic patient record. One hundred forty-eight patients underwent emergency appendicectomy during the study period. Fifty-six percent (n = 84) were male, and the median (range) age was 30.5 (17-76) years. Sixty-one percent had pre-operative imaging. The median (range) TTT was 18.37 (2-114) h; 7.5% (n = 11) waited > 48 h, 29.7% (n = 44) were operated on after 8 p.m. and 26% (n = 38) were done on elective lists. Male gender, admission CRP > 100 and admission before 12 p.m. significantly shortened TTT (p = 0.030, p = 0.004 and p = 0.001, respectively). However, pre-operative ultrasound, previous acute appendicitis and surgery on an elective list significantly prolonged TTT (p = 0.015 and p = 0.024, respectively). The median (range) LOS was 3 (1-24) nights. Ten percent (n = 15) had post-operative complications; however, longer TTT was not associated with higher complication rates (p = 0.196). This review highlights the impact of limited theatre access for on-call emergency admissions, with a significant portion of appendicectomies being done on elective lists or out-of-hours."

    "abstract": "Risk prediction accuracy of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) Surgical Risk Calculator has been shown to differ between emergency and elective surgery. Benchmarking methods of clinical performance require accurate risk estimation, and current methods rarely account for admission source; therefore, our goal was to assess whether the ACS-NSQIP predicts mortality comparably between transferred and nontransferred emergency general surgery (EGS) cases. This is a retrospective study using the ACS-NSQIP database from 2005 to 2014including all inpatients who underwent one of seven previously described EGS procedures. The admission source was classified as directly admitted versus transferred from an outside emergency room or an acute care facility. We compared the accuracy of ACS-NSQIP-predicted mortality probabilities using the observed-to-expected (O:E) ratio and Brier score. A subgroup analysis was performed to compare accuracy of high-risk and low-risk procedures. A total of 206,103 EGS admissions were identified, of which 6.97% were transfers. Overall mortality was 3.26% for the entire cohort and 10.24% within the transfer group. The O:E ratios generated by ACS-NSQIP models differed between transferred patients (O:E = 1.0, 95% confidence interval = 0.97-1.02) and nontransferred patients (O:E = 1.12, 95% confidence interval = 1.09-1.14). The Brier score for transferred patients was greater than that for nontransferred patients (0.063 versus 0.018, respectively) showing higher accuracy for nontransferred patients. The ACS-NSQIP risk estimates used for benchmarking differ between transferred and nontransferred EGS cases. Analyses of the Brier score by the ACS-NSQIP risk calculator demonstrated inferior prediction for transferred patients. This increased burden on accepting institutions will have an impact on quality metrics and should be considered for benchmarking of clinical performance."

    "abstract": "Patients requiring emergent surgery for hernia vary widely in presentation and management. The purpose of this study was to determine if the variation in timing of urgent surgery impacts surgical outcomes. The national NSQIP database for years 2011-2016 was queried for emergent surgeries for abdominal hernia resulting in obstruction or gangrene by primary post-op diagnosis. Diaphragmatic hernias were excluded. Patients were grouped by surgical timing from admission to day of surgery: same day, next day, and longer delay. Multinomial propensity score weighting was used to address potential differences in underlying covariates' clustering across the timing groups followed by multivariable logistic regression of morbidity and mortality. Weighted analysis yielded an effective sample size of 76,364. Hernia types included inguinal (20.9%); femoral (6.7%); umbilical (20.2%); ventral (41.0%); and other (10.4%). Delayed surgery was associated with increased rates of major complications (26.4% vs. 20.9%, p < 0.001), longer operative times (+ 12.5 min, p < 0.001), longer postoperative lengths of stay (+ 1.6 days, p < 0.001), increased re-operations (5.9% vs. 4.7%, p = 0.019), increased readmissions (7.0% vs. 5.7%, p = 0.004), and increased 30-day mortality (2.4% vs. 1.7%, p = 0.002). When controlling for other factors, next-day surgery (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.05-1.45, p = 0.009) and surgery delayed more than one day (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.13-1.73, p < 0.002) were associated with an increased odds of a major complication. Mortality and readmission by timing of surgery were not independently significant. Delay in surgery for emergent hernias increased the odds of major morbidity but not mortality. Patients presenting with hernia and an indication for urgent surgical intervention may benefit from an operation as soon as feasible rather than warrant waiting for further physiologic optimization, medical clearance, or specialized surgical personnel."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous mesenteric hematoma is an uncommon syndrome triggered by bleeding localized in the mesenteric vascular tree of a bowel segment for no apparent underlying reason. We herein report a surgical patient with an extremely rapidly growing spontaneous mesenteric hematoma that we successfully diagnosed using careful radiologic examination. A 56-year-old old male presenting sudden onset lower abdominal pain was referred to our emergency department. At the time of admission, his physical examination revealed stable vital signs without radiological abnormality. On the following day, the patient suddenly presented hypotension, tachycardia, and increased abdominal pain. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography examination showed a mass with both high- and low-density areas with a 130 mm maximum diameter bordering the transverse colon. Since interventional radiologists were not available, we decided to perform emergency exploratory laparotomy. On laparotomy, a 13 × 8 cm hematoma was found in the mesentery of the transverse colon. As bleeding was noted from the branches of the middle colic artery and gastrocolic artery, these responsible vessels were ligated. The patient was finally given the diagnosis of spontaneous mesenteric hematoma. The present case, initially diagnosed as enterocolitis, suddenly manifested hypovolemic shock. Close monitoring for any signs of further deterioration, as well as aggressive imaging diagnosis, enabled us to avoid delays in treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment of mesenteric hematomas are essential to prevent them from rupturing and triggering life-threatening adverse events."

    "abstract": "30% of elderly patients who require emergency general surgery (EGS) die in the year after the operation. Preoperative discussions can determine whether patients receive preference-sensitive care. Theoretically, surgeons frame their conversations after systematically assessing the risks and benefits of management options based on the clinical characteristics of each case. However, little is known about how surgeons actually deliberate about those options. To identify variables that influence surgeons' assessment of management options for critically-ill EGS patients. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 40 general surgeons in western Pennsylvania who worked in a variety of hospital settings. Interviews explored perioperative decision-making by asking surgeons to think aloud about selected memorable cases and a standardized case vignette of a frail patient with acute mesenteric ischemia. We used constant comparative methods to analyze interview transcripts and inductively developed a framework for the decision-making process. Surgeons averaged 13 years (standard deviation (SD) 10.4) of experience; 40% specialized in trauma/acute care surgery. Important themes regarding the main topic of \"perioperative decision-making\" included many considerations beyond the clinical characteristics of cases. Surgeons described the importance of variables ranging from the availability of institutional resources to professional norms. Surgeons often remarked on their desire to achieve individual flow, team efficiency, and concordant expectations of treatment and prognosis with patients. This is the first study to explore how surgeons decide among management options for critically-ill EGS patients. Surgeons' decision-making reflected a broad array of clinical, personal, and institutional variables. Effective interventions to ensure preference-sensitive care for EGS patients must address all of these variables."

The military maintains treatment facilities (MTFs) in remote locations to provide access to service members and their families. We sought to determine if patients treated at low-volume MTFs for EGS conditions experience worse outcomes compared with high-volume centers. We analyzed TRICARE data from 2006 to 2014. Patients were identified using an established coding algorithm for EGS admission. MTFs were divided into quartiles based on annual EGS volume. Outcomes included 30-d mortality, complications, and readmissions. Logistic regression models adjusting for clinical and sociodemographic differences in case-mix including EGS condition, surgical intervention, and comorbidities were used to determine the influence of hospital volume on outcomes. We identified 106,915 patients treated for an EGS condition at 79 MTFs. The overall mortality rate was 0.21%, with complications occurring in 8.55% and readmissions in 4.45%. After risk adjustment, lowest-volume MTFs did not demonstrate significantly higher odds of mortality (OR: 2.02, CI: 0.45-9.06) or readmissions (OR: 0.77, CI: 0.54-1.11) compared with the highest-volume centers. Lowest-volume facilities exhibited a lower likelihood of complications (OR: 0.76, CI: 0.59-0.98). EGS patients treated at low-volume MTFs did not experience worse clinical outcomes when compared with high-volume centers. Remote MTFs appear to provide care for EGS conditions comparable with that of high-volume facilities. Our findings speak against the need to reduce services at small, critical access facilities within the military health care system."

Methods: This was a post-hoc analysis of a prospectively collected database (January 2017-June 2018) from 28 centers in America. We compared pregnant and non-pregnant females' demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory data, imaging findings, management, and clinical outcomes. Results: Of the 3,597 subjects, 1,010 (28%) were of childbearing age, and 41 were pregnant: The mean age of the pregnant subjects was 30 ± 8 years at a median gestational age of 15 (range 10-23) weeks. The two groups had similar demographics and clinical presentation, but there were differences in management and outcomes. For example, in pregnant subjects, abdominal ultrasound scans (US) plus magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was the most frequently used imaging method (41%) followed by MRI alone (29%), US alone (22%), computed tomography (CT) (5%), and no imaging (2%). Despite similar American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Emergency General Surgery Clinical and Imaging Grade at presentation, pregnant subjects were more likely to be treated with antibiotics alone (15% versus 4%; p = 0.008). Pregnant subjects were less likely to have simple appendicitis and were more likely to have complicated (perforated or gangrenous) appendicitis or a normal appendix. With the exception of index hospital length of stay, there were no significant differences between the groups in clinical outcomes at index hospitalization or at 30 days. Conclusion: Almost 1 in 20 women of childbearing age presenting with appendicitis is pregnant. Appendicitis most commonly affects women in early to mid-pregnancy. Compared with non-pregnant women of childbearing age, pregnant women presenting with appendicitis undergo non-operative management more often and are less likely to have simple appendicitis. Compared with non-pregnant patients, they have similar clinical outcomes at both index hospitalization and 30 days after discharge."

Acute care surgery models are effective in decreasing mortality and morbidity after emergency surgeries, but sex-based differences in delivery and outcomes have not been explored. Our objective was to explore sex associated differences in the patient characteristics and clinical outcomes of those admitted to emergency general surgery. A post-hoc analysis of 512 emergency general surgical patients admitted consecutively to two tertiary care hospitals in Alberta Canada, between April 1, 2014 and July 31, 2015. We measured associations between sex and patient demographics, pre-, intra- and post-operative delivery of care, as well as post-operative outcomes. Of those excluded from the analysis, older females were more likely to undergo conservative management compared to older men (41% vs 34%, p = 0.03). Overall, there were no differences between sexes for time from admission to surgery, time spent in surgery, overall complication rate, mortality, hospital length of stay, or discharge disposition. Women were more likely to have a cancer diagnosis [OR 4.12 (95% CI: 1.61-10.5), p = 0.003, adjusted for age], while men were more likely to receive hernia surgery [OR 2.33 (95% CI 1.35-4.02), p = 0.002, adjusted for age and Charlson Comorbidity Index]. Finally, men were more likely to have a major respiratory complication [OR 2.73 (95% CI: 1.19-6.24), p = 0.02, adjusted for age]. Only two differences in peri and post-operative complications between sexes were noted, which suggests sex-based disparity in quality of care is limited once a decision has been made to operate. Future studies with larger databases are needed to corroborate our findings and investigate potential sex biases in surgical versus conservative management."

A retrospective chart review of 200 patients undergoing emergency laparoscopic appendectomies and cholecystectomies was conducted for a 2-year period at a single institution. Eligible patients were opioid-naïve adults admitted through the emergency department. Opioid administration and discharge prescriptions were converted to oral morphine equivalents (OME), and analyzed and compared with published literature and local guidelines. Opioid analgesia was provided as needed to 69% of patients in hospital with average dosing of 26.7 OME/day; comparatively, 99.5% of patients received prescriptions for opioids on discharge at an average dosing of 61.7 OME/day. The average dosing in the discharge prescriptions was not correlated with in-hospital needs (Pearson=-0.04; p=0.56); and higher narcotic doses were associated with combination opioid prescriptions compared with separate opioid prescriptions (73.8 (1.90) vs. 50.1 (1.90) OME/day; p<0.01). This difference was driven by the combination medication, Percocet. In the immediate postoperative period, most patients were managed in hospital with opioid analgesia dosages that fell within guidelines. Nearly all patients were provided with prescriptions for opioids on discharge, these prescriptions both exceeded local guidelines and were not correlated with in-hospital narcotic needs or pain scores.

    "abstract": "The incidence of severe perioperative renal dysfunction in high-acuity patients has not been well-explored at the national level. The present study aimed to evaluate the trends in the incidence of perioperative acute kidney injury and renal replacement therapy as well as associated mortality among patients undergoing an emergency general surgery operation. This was a retrospective cohort study using the National Inpatient Sample to identify all adult patients (>18 y) without chronic kidney disease who underwent an emergency general surgery procedure from 2008 to 2016. The study cohort was stratified based on presence of acute kidney injury and need for renal replacement therapy postoperatively. A multivariable logistic regression model was developed to predict the odds of mortality and composite morbidity. Nonparametric trend analyses of acute kidney injury and renal replacement therapy incidence and associated mortality were performed. Of an estimated 5,862,657 patients who underwent an emergency general surgery procedure during the study period, 7.4% patients developed an acute kidney injury and 0.48% patients required renal replacement therapy. Overall, the incidence of acute kidney injury (5.3%-19.4%) and renal replacement therapy (0.43%-0.93%) increased (P < .0001) over the study period. Even without need for renal replacement therapy, acute kidney injury was associated with greater odds of mortality and composite morbidity (adjusted odds ratio 5.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.1-5.3) and mortality (adjusted odds ratio = 2.20, 95% CI 2.3-2.4), as well as greater costs of hospitalization and duration of stay. In this national study, we found that the incidence of acute kidney injury and renal replacement therapy after an emergency general surgery operation has increased. Both acute renal failure and hemodialysis were associated with much greater odds of morbidity and mortality. The apparent increase in the rate of acute kidney injury and renal replacement therapy warrant further investigation of mechanisms for monitoring and limiting the impact of organ malperfusion associated with emergency general surgery operations."

    "abstract": "Cirrhosis is associated with adverse outcomes after emergency general surgery (EGS). The objective of this study was to determine the safety of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) in EGS patients with cirrhosis. We performed a two-year retrospective cohort analysis of adult patients who underwent LC for symptomatic gallstones. The primary outcome was the incidence of intraoperative complications. Of 796 patients, 59 (7.4%) were cirrhotic, with a median model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score of 15 (IQR, 7). On unadjusted analysis, patients with cirrhosis were older, more likely to be male (both P < 0.01), diabetic (P < 0.001), had a higher incidence of preadmission antithrombotic therapy use (P < 0.02), and experienced a longer time to surgery (3.2 vs 1.8 days, P < 0.001). Coarsened exact matching revealed no difference in intra- or postoperative complications between groups (P = 0.67). Operative duration was longer in patients with cirrhosis (162 vs 114 minutes, P = 0.001), who also had a nonsignificant increase in the rate of conversion to an open cholecystectomy (14% vs 4%, P = 0.07). The results of this study indicate that LC may be safely performed in EGS patients with cirrhosis."

We measured the efficacy of telephone follow-up to determine if it could safely reduce the need for routine postoperative clinic visits in this population. Low-risk nonelective laparoscopic appendectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, umbilical hernia, and inguinal hernia repair patients received telephone follow-up for symptoms concerning for surgical complication within 10 days of discharge. Clinic appointments were made if critical thresholds were reached. Outcomes of interest included rates of completed telephone screens, clinic visits avoided, and missed complications at 30 days postoperatively. Of 402 patients screened, 62 (15.4%) were scheduled for a clinic visit due to threshold responses and 27 (6.7%) were scheduled per patient request, while 275 (68.4%) patients screened negative and did not attend a clinic visit. One hundred sixty-three (59.3%) of the negative screen cohort were contacted after 30 days. Nine (5.5%) patients in this cohort were diagnosed with low-grade complications; no high-grade (Clavien-Dindo ≥ 3) complications were missed by telephone screening. Twenty surgery-related complications were identified in the full patient population; early telephone screening successfully identified the single high-grade complication. Post-discharge telephone follow-up in cEGS patients reduced the need for clinic follow-up visits by 68%. Missed complications were infrequent and low grade; telephone screening identified the single high-grade complication. Telephone follow-up for low-risk EGS patients is safe and increases efficiency of postoperative resource use."

    "abstract": "Emergent surgeries have different causes and physiologic patient responses than the same elective surgery, many of which are due to infectious etiologies. Therefore, we hypothesized that emergency cases have a higher risk of postoperative SSI than their elective counterparts. The ACS NSQIP database was queried from 2005 to 2016 for all cholecystectomies, ventral hernia repairs, and partial colectomies to examine common emergency and elective general surgery operations. Thirty-day outcomes were compared by emergent status. Any SSI was the primary outcome. There were 863,164 surgeries: 416,497 cholecystectomies, 220,815 ventral hernia repairs, and 225,852 partial colectomies. SSIs developed in 38,865 (4.5%) patients. SSIs increased with emergencies (5.3% vs 3.6% for any SSI). Postoperative sepsis (5.8% vs 1.5%), septic shock (4.7% vs 0.6%), length of stay (8.1 vs 2.9 days), and mortality (3.6% vs 0.4%) were increased in emergent surgery; P < 0.001 for all. When controlling for age, gender, BMI, diabetes, smoking, wound classification, comorbidities, functional status, and procedure on multivariate analysis, emergency surgery (odds ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 1.11-1.19) was independently associated with the development of SSI. Patients undergoing emergency general surgery experience increased rates of SSI. Patients and their families should be appropriately counseled regarding these elevated risks when consenting for emergency surgery."

However, recent electronic medical record (EMR)-based, comorbidity-focused frailty assessments have been developed. Our objective was to determine how a common bedside frailty assessment, the trauma and emergency surgery (TEGS) frailty index (FI), compares to an EMR-based frailty assessment in predicting geriatric TEGS outcomes. We retrospectively reviewed our quality improvement project database consisting of TEGS patients ≥ 65 y old. Patients were screened with the TEGS FI, a 15-question bedside assessment, including comorbidities, physical activity, emotional health, and nutrition. Six of 15 items were retrievable from the enterprise data warehouse (EDW), storing all EMR data from Northwestern Memorial Hospital, and use to calculate the EDW frailty score. Patient characteristics and outcomes were compared between different groups. Two hundred thirty-six geriatric TEGS patients were included, of which 75 (31.8%) were TEGS FI frail and 60 (25.4%) were EDW frail. TEGS FI frail patients had increased length of stay (LOS), loss of independence (LOI), and complications compared to TEGS FI nonfrail patients. EDW frail patients had higher LOS and complications than EDW nonfrail patients but similar LOI. TEGS FI and EDW frail patients had similar outcomes except TEGS FI-only patients more often have LOI. Bedside frailty assessments and EMR-based assessments are both effective in identifying geriatric TEGS patients at risk for increased LOS and complications. However, bedside frailty screening was better at identifying patients who have LOI and may be a more appropriate choice when screening for frailty."

A search of electronic information sources was conducted to identify all studies investigating the weekend effect in patients undergoing emergency General Surgery operations. Emergency operation during weekend was considered as exposure of interest, emergency operation during weekdays as comparison of interest, and postoperative mortality as the outcome of interest. Random or fixed effects modelling were applied to calculate pooled outcome data. Overall, 10 studies, enrolling 394,646 patients, were included. Worldwide, emergency General surgery operation during weekend was associated with a higher risk of postoperative mortality compared to weekdays (OR: 1.08, 95% CI 1.02, 1.14, P = 0.008, moderate quality evidence). The weekend effect was variable across the world. Although emergency operation during weekend was associated with a higher risk of postoperative mortality in the USA (OR: 1.12, 95% CI 1.01, 1.24, P = 0.03, moderate quality evidence) and Europe (OR: 1.37, 95% CI 1.11, 1.69, P = 0.003, moderate quality evidence), there was no difference in postoperative mortality between weekend and weekday groups in the UK (OR: 1.04, 95% CI 0.97, 1.11, P = 0.30, moderate quality evidence) and South Africa (OR: 0.79, 95% CI 0.44, 1.42, P = 0.43, moderate quality evidence). The weekend effect in emergency General Surgery is variable across the world. Although it seems to be significant in the USA and Europe, it does not increase the risk of postoperative mortality in the UK. Future studies should focus on differences in staffing levels and available resources at weekends in emergency General surgery settings across the world."

We hypothesized that despite the ACA, racial and geographic disparities persisted for EGS admissions. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was queried from 2012 through Q3 of 2015 for Non-Medicare patient EGS admissions. Difference-in-Differences analyses (DID) compared payors, complications, mortality and costs in pre-ACA years (2012-2013) and post-ACA years (2014-2015Q3). EGS cases fell 9.1% from 1,711,940 to 1,555,033 NIS-weighted cases. Hispanics were still most likely to be uninsured but had improved coverage (OR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.88-0.96, p < 0.001).

    "abstract": "In acute care surgery, an increasing number of patients operatively treated for small bowel obstruction undergo laparoscopic procedures. However, intersigmoid hernia is a rare condition. In some reports, surgeons have successfully operated on patients with an intersigmoid hernia via a laparoscopic approach. The laparoscopic approach has the advantage of facilitating simultaneous diagnosis and surgical intervention for intersigmoid hernias. In the laparoscopic approach, sufficient decompression of the small bowel is preoperatively performed in most cases. We encountered a patient with an intersigmoid hernia who underwent an emergency laparoscopic approach without sufficient decompression. Because sufficient decompression of the small bowel was not preoperatively performed, it was difficult to establish a working space and visualize the site of obstruction; however, we performed the laparoscopic approach safely, and diagnosis and surgical intervention were possible. Moreover, the postoperative course was uneventful. We successfully performed an emergency surgery using a laparoscopic approach for an intersigmoid hernia without sufficient decompression. The success of the procedure is attributable to the disease-specific surgical strategy, surgical technique, and the recent technological advances in multidetector-row computed tomography. We believe that careful preoperative diagnosis and strategy can lead to a good outcome and that the significance of emergency laparoscopic approach without sufficient decompression will keep increasing."

Few studies have investigated changes in EGS-associated mortality over time or explored mortality rates after discharge. The aim of this study was to conduct a comprehensive, population-based analysis of mortality in EGS patients over a 20-year time frame. This was a cross-sectional study of all adult EGS admissions in Scotland between 1996 and 2015. Data were obtained from national records. Co-morbidities were defined by Charlson Co-morbidity Index, and operations were coded by OPCS-4 classifications. Linear and multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate changes over time. Among 1 450 296 patients, the overall inpatient, 30-day, 90-day and 1-year mortality rates were 1·8, 3·8, 6·4 and 12·5 per cent respectively. Mortality was influenced by age at admission, co-morbidity, operation performed and date of admission (all P < 0·001), and improved with time on subgroup analysis by age, co-morbidity and operation status. Medium-term mortality was high: the 1-year mortality rate in patients aged over 75 years was 35·6 per cent. The 1-year mortality rate in highly co-morbid patients decreased from 75·1 to 57·1 per cent over the time frame of the study (P < 0·001). Mortality after EGS in Scotland has reduced significantly over the past 20 years. This analysis of medium-term mortality after EGS admission demonstrates strikingly high rates, and postdischarge death rates are higher than is currently appreciated. Los pacientes sometidos a cirugía general urgente (emergency general surgery, EGS) presentan una mortalidad más elevada que los pacientes sometidos a cirugía electiva. Pocos estudios han investigado los cambios en la mortalidad asociada a la EGS a lo largo del tiempo o han analizado las tasas de mortalidad tras el alta hospitalaria. El objetivo de este estudio fue llevar a cabo un análisis exhaustivo de base poblacional de la mortalidad en pacientes en EGS durante un horizonte temporal de 20 años. Se trata de un estudio transversal de todos los ingresos de adultos por EGS en Escocia entre 1996 y 2015. Los datos se obtuvieron de los registros nacionales. Las comorbilidades se definieron según el índice de comorbilidad de Charlson y las operaciones se codificaron con las clasificaciones OPCS4. Se utilizaron modelos de regresión logística lineal y multivariante para evaluar cambios a los largo del tiempo. En un total de 1.450.296 pacientes, las tasas globales de mortalidad hospitalaria, a los 30 días, 90 días y un año fueron de 1,8%, 3,8%, 6,4% y 12,5%, respectivamente. La mortalidad estaba influida por la edad en el momento del ingreso, comorbilidad, la intervención quirúrgica realizada y la fecha de ingreso (todas las variables P < 0,001) y mejoró con el tiempo en el análisis por subgrupos de edad, comorbilidad e intervenciones quirúrgicas. La mortalidad a medio plazo fue elevada: la tasa de mortalidad a un año en pacientes mayores de 75 años fue de 35,6%. La mortalidad a un año en pacientes con elevada morbilidad disminuyó de un 75% a un 57% a lo largo del periodo del estudio (P < 0,001). La mortalidad tras EGS en Escocia ha disminuido significativamente a lo largo de los últimos 20 años. No obstante, el análisis de la mortalidad a medio plazo después de un ingreso por EGS demuestra unas tasas sorprendentemente elevadas y, por ello, actualmente hay que tener en cuenta la mortalidad tras el alta de forma especial."

All patients who underwent LC on an ACS service during a 26-month period were identified. Demographic, perioperative, and complication data were collected and analyzed with Fisher's exact test, χ2 test, and Mann-Whitney U Test. During the study period, 547 patients (70.2% female, mean age 46.1±18.1, mean body mass index 32.4±7.8 kg/m2) had LC performed for various acute indications. Mean surgery time was 77.9±50.2 minutes, and 5.7% of cases were performed \"after hours.\" Rate of conversion to open procedure was 6%. Complications seen included minor bile leaks (3.8%), infection (3.8%), retained gallstones (1.1%), organ injury (1.1%), major duct injury (0.9%), and postoperative bleeding (0.9%). Statistical analysis demonstrated significant relationships between conversion, length of surgery, age, gender, and intraoperative cholangiogram with various complications. No significant relationships were detected between complications and BMI, pregnancy, attending experience, and time of operation. Although several statistically significant relationships were identified between several risk factors and complications, these findings have limited clinical significance. Factors including attending years in practice and time of the operation were not associated with increased complications. ACS services are capable of performing a high volume of LCs for emergent indications with low complication and conversion rates.-Level of evidence:IV."

The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) developed an Emergency General Surgery (EGS) disease severity grading system for ASBO. We stratified patients' ASBO severity and captured hospitalization costs hypothesizing that increased disease severity would correlate with greater costs. This was a single-center study of hospitalized adult patients with SBO during 2015-2017. Clinical data and estimated total cost (direct + indirect) were abstracted. AAST EGS grades (I-IV) stratified disease severity. Costs were normalized to the median grade I cost. Univariate and multivariate analyses evaluated the relationship between normalized cost and AAST EGS grade, length of hospital and ICU stay, operative time, and Charlson comorbidity index. There were 214 patients; 119 (56%) were female. AAST EGS grades included: I (62%, n = 132), II (23%, n = 49), III (7%, n = 16), and IV (8%, n = 17). Relative to grade I, median normalized cost increased by 1.4-fold for grade II, 1.6-fold for grade III, and 4.3-fold for grade IV disease. No considerable differences in patient comorbidity between grades were observed. Pair-wise comparisons demonstrated that grade I disease cost less than higher grades (corrected p < 0.001). Non-operative management was associated with lower normalized cost compared to operative management (1.1 vs. 4.5, p < 0.0001). In patients who failed non-operative management, normalized cost was increased 7.2-fold. Collectively, the AAST EGS grade correlated well with cost (Spearman's p = 0.7, p < 0.0001). After adjustment for covariates, AAST EGS grade maintained a persistent relationship with cost. Increasing ASBO severity is independently associated with greater costs.

This study aims to define current perceptions among trauma and emergency general surgery (EGS) patients regarding HIV and hepatitis C screening practices. Prospective survey administered to adult (>18 years old) acute care surgery service (trauma and EGS) patients at a Level 1 academic trauma center. The survey consisted of 13 multiple choice questions: demographics, whether admission tests included HIV and hepatitis C at index and prior hospital visits and whether receiving no result indicated a negative result, prior primary care screening. Response percentages calculated in standard fashion. One hundred and twenty-five patients were surveyed: 80 trauma and 45 EGS patients. Overall, 32% and 29.6% of patients believed they were screened for HIV and hepatitis C at admission. There was no significant difference in beliefs between trauma and EGS. Sixty-eight percent of patients had a hospital visit within 10 years of these, 49.3% and 44.1% believe they had been screened for HIV and hepatitis C. More EGS patients believed they had a prior screen for both conditions. Among patients who believed they had a prior screen and did not receive any results, 75.9% (HIV) and 80.8% (hepatitis C) believed a lack of results meant they were negative. Only 28.9% and 23.6% of patients had ever been offered outpatient HIV and hepatitis C screening. A large portion of patients believe they received admission or prior hospitalization HIV and/or hepatitis C screening and the majority interpreted a lack of results as a negative diagnosis. Due to these factors, routine screening of trauma/EGS patients should be considered to conform to patient expectations and national guidelines, increase diagnosis and referral for medical management, and decrease disease transmission."

All studies were performed at level 1 trauma centers. The duration of ACS rotations ranges from 1 to 4 weeks with variable night call schedules. While several curricular changes have improved student perceptions on ACS education, none of the studies have thoroughly evaluated the impact on students' readiness or career choices for their postgraduate training. The current lack of information on ACS education in medical school has left us with a need to better understand this area in order to improve students' experience and exposure to the specialty. Future efforts should be placed on addressing current issues in ACS education and evaluating its impact on career choice of medical students."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) accounts for more than 2 million U.S. hospital admissions annually. Low-income EGS patients have higher rates of postoperative adverse events (AEs) than high-income patients. This may be related to health care segregation (a disparity in access to high-quality centers). The emergent nature of EGS conditions and the limited number of EGS providers in rural areas may result in less health care segregation and thereby less variability in EGS outcomes in rural areas. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of income on AEs for both rural and urban EGS patients. The National Inpatient Sample (2007-2014) was queried for patients receiving one of 10 common EGS procedures. Multivariate regression models stratified by income quartiles in urban and rural cohorts adjusting for sociodemographic, clinical, and other hospital-based factors were used to determine the rates of surgical AEs (mortality, complications, and failure to rescue [FTR]). 1,687,088 EGS patients were identified; 16.60% (n = 280,034) of them were rural. In the urban cohort, lower income quartiles were associated with higher odds of AEs (mortality OR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.15-1.27], complications, 1.07 [1.06-1.09]; FTR, 1.17 [1.10-1.24] P < 0.001). In the rural context, income quartiles were not associated with the higher odds of AE (mortality OR, 1.14 [0.83-1.55], P = 0.42; complications, 1.06 [0.97-1,16], P = 1.17; FTR, 1.12 [0.79-1.59], P = 0.52). Lower income is associated with higher postoperative AEs in the urban setting but not in a rural environment. This socioeconomic disparity in EGS outcomes in urban settings may reflect health care segregation, a differential access to high-quality health care for low-income patients."

The impact of ACS service model implementation on the quality and efficiency of care (EOC) outcomes in acute appendicitis (AA) and acute cholecystitis (AC) cohorts was evaluated. Methods A retrospective chart review (N=1,229) of adult AA and AC patients admitted prior to (pre-ACS; n=507; three hospitals; 2007) and after regionalization (R-ACS; n=722; one hospital; 2011). Results R-ACS time to ER physician assessment was significantly longer for AA (3.4 ± 2.3 versus 2.4 ± 2.6 hr; p ≤ 0.001). Surgical response times (1.3 ± 1.2 vs 2.6 ± 4.3 hr for AA; 1.8 ± 1.5 vs 4.1 ± 5.0 hr for AC; p ≤ 0.0001) and acquisition of imaging (4.1 ± 4.1 vs 6.9 ± 9.9 hr for AA, p ≤ 0.0001; 7.8 ± 1.9 vs 13.2 ± 18.5 hr for AC, p ≤ 0.008) occurred significantly faster with R-ACS. R-ACS resulted in a significant increase in night-time appendectomies (21.7% vs 11.1%; p ≤ 0.002), perforated appendices (29.1 % vs 18.9 %; p ≤ 0.006), 30-day readmissions (4.56% vs 0.82%; p ≤ 0.01), and lower rate of intraoperative complications for AC patients (2.78% vs 7.69%; p ≤ 0.02). Conclusions Despite the increased volume of patients seen with the implementation of R-ACS, surgical assessments and diagnostic imaging were significantly more prompt. EOC measures were maintained. Worse AA outcomes highlight areas for improvement in delivering R-ACS."

    "abstract": "This study determined the prevalence of complicated appendicitis in elderly patients diagnosed preoperatively with uncomplicated appendicitis. Patients with a preoperative diagnosis of uncomplicated appendicitis at an academic hospital from 11/2013 to 05/2017 were reviewed. Patients ≥65 years were compared to those younger. Pathology reports were categorized as either uncomplicated or complicated (COMP). The primary outcome was the prevalence of COMP appendicitis. The prevalence of COMP appendicitis increased with age after 20 years with an abrupt increase after 65 years. Patients ≥65 years were more likely to have COMP appendicitis (48.1% vs. 15.5%; OR: 5.1; p < 0.01) and prolonged stays (3.8 vs. 2.3 days; p < 0.01). Nearly half of elderly patients had pathologic confirmation of complicated appendicitis despite no preoperative clinical or radiographic suspicion for complicated appendicitis. Nonoperative management of acute appendicitis in the elderly may not be appropriate due to the high rate of unexpected complicated appendicitis."

    "title": "Understanding the influences on successful quality improvement in emergency general surgery: learning from the RCS Chole-QuIC project.",
    "abstract": "Acute gallstone disease is the highest volume Emergency General Surgical presentation in the UK. Recent data indicate wide variations in the quality of care provided across the country, with national guidance for care delivery not implemented in most UK hospitals. Against this backdrop, the Royal College of Surgeons of England set up a 13-hospital quality improvement collaborative (Chole-QuIC) to support clinical teams to reduce time to surgery for patients with acute gallstone disease requiring emergency cholecystectomy. Prospective, mixed-methods process evaluation to answer the following: (1) how was the collaborative delivered by the faculty and received, understood and enacted by the participants; (2) what influenced teams' ability to improve care for patients requiring emergency cholecystectomy? We collected and analysed a range of data including field notes, ethnographic observations of meetings, and project documentation. Analysis was based on the framework approach, informed by Normalisation Process Theory, and involved the creation of comparative case studies based on hospital performance during the project. Chole-QuIC was delivered as planned and was well received and understood by participants. Four hospitals were identified as highly successful, based upon a substantial increase in the number of patients having surgery in line with national guidance. Conversely, four hospitals were identified as challenged, achieving no significant improvement. The comparative analysis indicate that six inter-related influences appeared most associated with improvement: (1) achieving clarity of purpose amongst site leads and key stakeholders; (2) capacity to lead and effective project support; (3) ideas to action; (4) learning from own and others' experience; (5) creating additional capacity to do emergency cholecystectomies; and (6) coordinating/managing the patient pathway. Collaborative-based quality improvement is a viable strategy for emergency surgery but success requires the deployment of effective clinical strategies in conjunction with improvement strategies. In particular, achieving clarity of purpose about proposed changes amongst key stakeholders was a vital precursor to improvement, enabling the creation of additional surgical capacity and new pathways to be implemented effectively. Protected time, testing ideas, and the ability to learn quickly from data and experience were associated with greater impact within this cohort."

    "abstract": "There is abundant local, national, and international evidence that clinical decision-making in emergency general surgery (EGS) is frequently sub-optimal, and this has a negative impact on the quality and safety of care and patient outcomes. The barriers to achieving high-quality, safe, and effective EGS care across health systems are manifold and multifactorial. It is suggested that emergency surgery registries may provide a suitable foundation to enable interventions that lead to improvements in quality in this area. Data from surgical registries may serve multiple purposes, including improving the quality of healthcare and the enhancement of patient safety. The increasing sophistication and analytic capabilities of clinical registries and databases contribute considerably in all of these domains due to their use of accurate, credible, risk-adjusted, and concurrent clinical data, which are acquired for these specific purposes. The emergency surgery outcomes advancement (eSOAP) project commenced during late 2018, with the aim of establishing the feasibility of prospective data capture on all EGS admissions and assessing the outcomes and impact of clinical pathways for patients admitted to EGS services in Letterkenny University Hospital (Republic of Ireland), Altnagelvin Hospital (Northern Ireland), and Raigmore Hospital (Scotland). eSOAP seeks to address deficits in EGS care by enabling an assessment of patient outcomes, enhancing the quality and safety of patient care, and providing an effective template for EGS registry development. It will achieve this through the provision of meticulous, valid, risk-adjusted, and concurrent clinical data. The comprehensive information within the eSOAP registry will promote transparency in respect of the functioning of individual surgical teams and services and increase understanding of the complex systems involved in the delivery of EGS care."

    "abstract": "Acute care surgery (ACS) encompasses trauma, critical care, and emergency general surgery. Due to high volumes of emergency surgery, an ACS service was developed at a referral hospital in Rwanda. The aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiology of ACS and understand the impact of an ACS service on patient outcomes. This is a retrospective observational study of ACS patients before and after introduction of an ACS service. χ2 test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used to describe the epidemiology and compare outcomes before (pre-ACS)) and after (post-ACS) implementation of the ACS service. Data were available for 120 patients before ACS and 102 patients after ACS. Diagnoses included: intestinal obstruction (n=80, 36%), trauma (n=38, 17%), appendicitis (n=31, 14%), and soft tissue infection (n=17, 8%) with no difference between groups. The most common operation was midline laparotomy (n=138, 62%) with no difference between groups (p=0.910). High American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score (ASA ≥3) (11% vs. 40%, p<0.001) was more common after ACS. There was no difference in intensive care unit admission (8% vs. 8%, p=0.894), unplanned reoperation (22% vs. 13%, p=0.082), or mortality (10% vs. 11%, p=0.848). The median length of hospital stay was longer (11 days vs. 7 days, p<0.001) before ACS. An ACS service can be implemented in a low-resource setting. In Rwanda, ACS patients are young with few comorbidities, but high rates of mortality and morbidity. In spite of more patients who are critically ill in the post-ACS period, implementation of an ACS service resulted in decreased length of hospital stay with no difference in morbidity and mortality.

    "abstract": "Transplant patients are at the risk of serious sequelae from medical and surgical intervention. The incidence and burden of emergency general surgery (EGS) in transplant patients are scarcely known. This study aims to identify predictors of outcomes in transplant patients with EGS needs. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2007-2011) was queried for adult patients (aged ≥16 y) who underwent abdominal visceral transplantation. These were further queried for a secondary diagnosis of an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma-defined EGS condition. Outcome measures included mortality, complications, length of stay, and cost of care. Propensity scores were used to match patients across baseline characteristics. Multivariate analysis was used to further adjust propensity score quintiles and hospital-level characteristics. A total of 35,573 transplant patients were identified. Of these, 30% (n = 10,676) developed an EGS condition. Most common EGS conditions were resuscitation (7.7%), intestinal obstruction (7.3%), biliary conditions (3.9%), and hernias (3.2%). Patients with public insurance, those in the highest income quartile, and those treated at larger hospitals had a lower likelihood of developing an EGS condition (P < 0.05). Patients with an EGS condition had a ninefold higher likelihood of mortality and a threefold higher likelihood of developing complications (odds ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 9.21 [1.80-10.89] and 3.17 [3.02-3.34], respectively). Transplant patients after EGS had a longer risk-adjusted length of stay and cost of index hospitalization (Absolute difference [95% CI]: 12.70 [12.14-13.26] and $57,797 [55,415-60,179], respectively]). Transplant patients fare poorly after developing an EGS condition. The results of this study will help in identifying at-risk patients and determining outcomes."

    "abstract": "A major incident is any emergency that requires special arrangements by the emergency services and generally involves a large number of people. Recent such events in England have included the Manchester Arena bombing and the Grenfell Tower disaster. Hospitals are required by law to keep a major incident plan (MIP) outlining the response to such an event. In a survey conducted in 2006 we found a substantial knowledge gap among key individuals that would be expected to respond to the enactment of an MIP. We set out to repeat this survey study and assess any improvement since our original report. We identified NHS trusts in England that received more than 30 000 patients through the emergency department in the fourth quarter of the 2016/2017 period. We contacted the on-call anaesthetic, emergency, general surgery, and trauma and orthopaedic registrar at each location and asked each individual to answer a short verbal survey assessing their confidence in using their hospital's MIP. Of those eligible for the study, 62% were able to be contacted and consented to the study. In total 50% of respondents had read all or part of their hospital's MIP, 46.8% were confident that they knew where their plan was stored, and 36% knew the role they would play if a plan came into effect. These results show less confidence among middle-grade doctors compared with 2006. Confidence in using MIPs among specialty registrars in England is still low. In light of this, we make a number of recommendations designed to improve the education of hospital doctors in reacting to major incidents."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the rate of cholecystectomy before and after adoption of an emergency general surgery (EGS) model at our institution. A longitudinal, observational study was conducted prior to and following introduction of an EGS model at our institution. Using the New York SPARCS Administrative Database, all adult patients presenting to the emergency department with gallbladder-related emergencies were identified. The rates of laparoscopic and open cholecystectomies performed 3 years prior and 3 years following the adoption of the EGS model were examined. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to compare the incidence of cholecystectomy at initial ED visit at our institution pre- and post-EGS introduction as well as to those in the rest of the state as an external control group, while adjusting for potentially confounding factors. There were 176,159 total ED visits of patients with gallbladder emergencies (154,743 excluding repeat presenters) in the studied period in NY State. Of these, 63,912 patients (41.3%) had a concurrent cholecystectomy in NY State. The rate of cholecystectomy at these institutions remained relatively steady from 38.8% from 2010 to 2013 and 38.6% from 2013 to 2016. At our institution, there were 2039 gallbladder emergencies, and of those 755 underwent cholecystectomy. At our institution, there was an increase from 28.21% 3 years prior to the adoption of the EGS model to 40.2% in the following 3 years (RR = 1.06, 95% CI 1.0164-1.1078, p = 0.0069). The initiation of the EGS model at a tertiary center was associated with a significant increase in the number of concurrent cholecystectomies from 28.21 to 40.2% over a 6-year period. This change was accompanied by an increase in the number of patient comorbidities and a lower insurance status."

However, its use in emergency general surgery (EGS) procedures is not well characterized. The purpose of this study was to examine the trends in utilization and outcomes of MIS techniques in EGS over the past decade. The 2007-2016 ACS-NSQIP database was utilized to identify patients undergoing emergency surgery for four common EGS diagnoses: appendicitis, cholecystitis/cholangitis, peptic ulcer disease, and small bowel obstruction. Trends over time were described. Preoperative risk factors, operative characteristics, outcomes, morbidity, and trends were compared between MIS and open approaches using univariate and multivariate analysis. During the 10-year study period, 190,264 patients were identified. The appendicitis group was the largest (166,559 patients) followed by gallbladder disease (9994), bowel obstruction (6256), and peptic ulcer disease (366). Utilization of MIS increased over time in all groups (p < 0.001). There was a concurrent decrease in mean days of hospitalization in each group: appendectomy (2.4 to 2.0), cholecystectomy (5.7 to 3.2), peptic ulcer disease (20.3 to 11.7), and bowel obstruction (12.9 to 10.5); p < 0.001 for all. On multivariate analysis, use of MIS techniques was associated with decreased odds of 30-day mortality, surgical site infection, and length of hospital stay in all groups (p < 0.001). Use of MIS techniques in these four EGS diagnoses has increased in frequency over the past 10 years. When adjusted for preoperative risk factors, use of MIS was associated with decreased odds of wound infection, death, and length of stay. Further studies are needed to determine if increased access to MIS techniques among EGS patients may improve outcomes."

    "abstract": "Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are increasingly used to supplant the limited number of orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). The present study aimed to perform a contemporary analysis of emergency abdominal operations after LVAD and OHT at a national level. The 2005-2015 National Impatient Sample, the largest all-payer hospitalization database in the United States, was used to identify all adult patients who had received LVAD or OHT. The primary outcome of interest was the rate of emergency general surgery (EGS), which included laparotomy, small or large bowel resection, peptic ulcer operation, adhesiolysis, and cholecystectomy, during the same hospitalization as LVAD or OHT. Logistic regression was used to determine risk factors for EGS as well as the association between EGS and mortality in both the LVAD and OHT populations. Of the estimated 19,395 OHT and 23,441 LVAD performed, 445 (2.3%) OHT and 719 (3.1%) LVAD patients required EGS. The incidence of EGS in LVAD decreased from 5.4 to 3.3%, whereas it increased among OHT patients from 1.9 to 3.7%, P = 0.003. Occurrence of EGS after OHT and LVAD was associated with significantly higher inpatient risk-adjusted mortality (OHT adjusted odds ratio, 3.0; P = 0.004; LVAD adjusted odds ratio, 2.5; P < 0.001), incremental hospitalization costs (OHT, $106,778; P < 0.001; LVAD, $61,965; P < 0.001), and length of stay (OHT, 27.9 d; P < 0.001; LVAD, 20.8 d; P < 0.001). EGS remains an infrequent but high mortality and cost complication of OHT and LVAD. Further investigation of the impact of immunosuppression, anticoagulation, and perfusion strategies on incidence of abdominal complications is warranted."

    "abstract": "There is a longstanding interest in the field of management science to study high performance organizations. Applied to medicine, research on hospital performance indicates that some hospitals are high performing, while others are not. The objective of this study was to identify a cluster of high-performing emergency general surgery (EGS) hospitals and assess whether high performance at one EGS operation was associated with high performance on all EGS operations. Adult patients who underwent one of eight EGS operations were identified in the California State Inpatient Database (2010-2011), which we linked to the American Hospital Association database. Beta regression was used to estimate a hospital's risk-adjusted mortality, accounting for patient- and hospital-level factors. Centroid cluster analysis grouped hospitals by patterns of mortality rates across the eight EGS operations using z scores. Multinomial logistic regression compared hospital characteristics by cluster. A total of 220 acute care hospitals were included. Three distinct clusters of hospitals were defined based on assessment of mortality for each operation type: high-performing hospitals (n = 66), average performing (n = 99), and low performing (n = 55). The mortality by individual operation type at the high-performing cluster was consistently at least 1.5 standard deviations better than the low-performing cluster (p < 0.001). Within-cluster variation was minimal at high-performing hospitals compared with wide variation at low-performing hospitals. A hospital's high performance in one EGS operation type predicted high performance on all EGS operation types. High-performing EGS hospitals attain excellence across all types of EGS operations, with minimal variability in mortality. Poor-performing hospitals are persistently below average, even for low-risk operations. These findings suggest that top-performing EGS hospitals are highly reliable, with systems of care in place to achieve consistently superior results. Further investigation and collaboration are needed to identify the factors associated with high performance. Prognostic, level III."

    "abstract": "In this Emergency Medicine Cardiac Research and Education Group (EMCREG)-International Proceedings Monograph from the October 20, 2018, EMCREG-International Multidisciplinary Consensus Panel on Management of Severe Bleeding in Patients Treated With Oral Anticoagulants held in Orlando, FL, you will find a detailed discussion regarding the treatment of patients requiring anticoagulation and the reversal of anticoagulation for patients with severe bleeding. For emergency physicians, critical care physicians, hospitalists, cardiologists, internists, surgeons, and family physicians, the current approach and disease indications for treatment with anticoagulants such as coumadin, factor IIa, and factor Xa inhibitors are particularly relevant. When a patient treated with anticoagulants presents to the emergency department, intensive care unit, or operating room with severe, uncontrollable bleeding, achieving rapid, controlled hemostasis is critically important to save the patient's life. This EMCREG-International Proceedings Monograph contains multiple sections reflecting critical input from experts in Emergency Cardiovascular Care, Prehospital Emergency Medical Services, Emergency Medicine Operations, Hematology, Hospital Medicine, Neurocritical Care, Cardiovascular Critical Care, Cardiac Electrophysiology, Cardiology, Trauma and Acute Care Surgery, and Pharmacy. The first section provides a description of the current indications for the treatment of patients using oral anticoagulants including coumadin, the factor IIa (thrombin) inhibitor dabigatran, and factor Xa inhibitors such as apixaban and rivaroxaban. In the remaining sections, the treatment of patients presenting to the hospital with major bleeding becomes the focus. The replacement of blood components including red blood cells, platelets, and clotting factors is the critically important initial treatment for these individuals. Reversing the anticoagulated state is also necessary. For patients treated with coumadin, infusion of vitamin K helps to initiate the process of protein synthesis for the vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins II, VII, IX, and X and the antithrombotic protein C and protein S. Repletion of clotting factors for the patient with 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate, which includes factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X and therapeutically effective concentrations of the regulatory proteins (protein C and S), provides real-time ability to slow bleeding. For patients treated with the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, treatment using the highly specific, antibody-derived idarucizumab has been demonstrated to reverse the hypocoagulable state of the patient to allow blood clotting. In May 2018, andexanet alfa was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to reverse the factor Xa anticoagulants apixaban and rivaroxaban in patients with major bleeding. Before the availability of this highly specific agent, therapy for patients treated with factor Xa inhibitors presenting with severe bleeding usually included replacement of lost blood components including red blood cells, platelets, and clotting factors and 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate, or if not available, fresh frozen plasma. The evaluation and treatment of the patient with severe bleeding as a complication of oral anticoagulant therapy are discussed from the viewpoint of the emergency physician, neurocritical and cardiovascular critical care intensivist, hematologist, trauma and acute care surgeon, hospitalist, cardiologist, electrophysiologist, and pharmacist in an approach we hope that the reader will find extremely practical and clinically useful. The clinician learner will also find the discussion of the resumption of oral anticoagulation for the patient with severe bleeding after effective treatment important because returning the patient to an anticoagulated state as soon as feasible and safe prevents thrombotic complications. Finally, an EMCREG-International Severe Bleeding Consensus Panel algorithm for the approach to management of patients with life-threatening oral anticoagulant-associated bleeding is provided for the clinician and can be expanded in size for use in a treatment area such as the emergency department or critical care unit."

Research into emergency laparotomy (EL) care is moving from observational studies which simply measure EL outcomes to interventional research evaluating the implementation of care strategies designed to improve the quality and outcomes from EL care. There is no consensus as to the optimal approach to conducting research in this sphere. The primary objective of this review was to examine how mortality and other outcome measures were reported in previous EL research and to identify what might be the most appropriate methods in future outcome research. A systematic review was performed in accordance with the PRISMA principles. Electronic databases were interrogated with a pre-specified search strategy to identify English language studies addressing outcomes from EL care. Retrieved papers were screened and assessed according to pre-defined eligibility criteria. The mortality and other outcomes reported in each paper were extracted and examined. 16 studies were included. They demonstrated significant heterogeneity in case definition, outcome reporting and data processing. A wide range of mortality and other outcome measures were applied and reported. Only few studies included on patient-reported outcomes measures. The heterogeneity in EL research, demonstrated by this review must be considered when EL outcomes are compared. A standardized approach with respect to case definition, outcome measurement, and data analysis would provide for more valid and comparable evaluation of EL outcomes. Future EL research should include more patient centred outcomes."

This condition is a surgical emergency requiring cholecystectomy as it can lead to gallbladder perforation and bilious peritonitis with high morbidity to the patient. An 85-year-old woman with chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented with acute-onset right upper-quadrant abdominal pain and associated nausea with emesis. After admission to the surgical service and initiation of intravenous antibiotics, the patient was taken to the operating room for surgical management due to the persistence of symptoms. Intraoperative findings included a necrotic appearing gallbladder that was twisted on the cystic duct. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed, which was complicated by bile leak requiring endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with bile duct stenting followed by operative washout. Gallbladder volvulus can be challenging to diagnose. This condition should be suspected in elderly women with acute-onset abdominal pain and imaging concerning for acute cholecystitis. Emergent cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for gallbladder volvulus."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) represents a diverse set of operations performed on acutely ill patients. Those undergoing EGS are at higher likelihood of complications, readmission, and death, but the effect of primary language on EGS outcomes has not been evaluated. We aimed to evaluate the association of non-English primary language on outcomes after EGS operations. The New Jersey Statewide Inpatient Database from 2009 to 2014 was used to evaluate cases representing 80% of the national burden of EGS. Cases were restricted to ages ≥18 y, emergency department admissions, noted to be emergent or urgent, and performed between 0 and 2 d after admission. We evaluated Spanish speakers and non-English, non-Spanish (NENS) speakers compared with English. Outcomes included in-hospital mortality, 7-d readmission, and hospital length of stay (LOS). Logistic and negative binomial regression was used, and generalized linear mixed models were used to account for hierarchy in the data. There were 105,171 patients included. English speakers were majority white and with private insurance; Spanish speakers were younger and with fewer comorbidities. Where differences between Spanish and NENS speakers existed, NENS were more like the English-speaking group. Adjusted results indicate that Spanish speakers had reduced LOS after appendectomy (IRR: 0.92 [0.89-0.95]) and lysis of adhesion [0.93 (0.88-0.97)]. Spanish speakers had an increased LOS after higher risk operations (IRR: 1.14 [1.10-1.20]). NENS speakers had a reduced LOS after adhesiolysis (IRR: 0.94 [0.89-0.99]). There was no difference in mortality or short-term readmission CONCLUSIONS: These data from a large database suggest that the effect of primary language on LOS after EGS depends on the type of operation. Future studies should focus on long-term outcomes and determining if the lack of association we observed is generalizable to other regions of the United States."

After applying 1:1 propensity score matching, in comparison to patients discharged home, individuals discharged to a skilled nursing facility had a greater odds of respiratory (odds ratio 2.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.59-3.38) and septic complications (odds ratio 1.63, 95% confidence interval 1.12-2.36) after discharge. Furthermore, following surgery, individuals discharged to a skilled nursing facility had a greater odds of 30-day readmission (odds ratio 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.29), and death within 30 days of the procedure (odds ratio 2.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.65-2.61). After accounting for patient severity and perioperative course, discharge to a skilled nursing facility is an independent risk factor for death, readmission, and postdischarge complications."

    "abstract": "The burden of emergency general surgery leads to higher cost and less compensation to institutions; cholecystectomy accounts for >150,000 cases/y, the highest number of emergency general surgery cases that have a potentially elective course. We hypothesize that our cholecystectomy patient pool has unique characteristics informing health care access in our area. We retrospectively identified cholecystectomy patients at our academic hospital over a 6-mo period from January to June of 2018 and classified them as emergent or elective. We excluded pregnant patients, patients aged <18 y, and patients who had undergone another major procedure concurrently. Patient demographics and clinical course were abstracted from the medical record. Two hundred and sixty-seven patients were included in the study, with most patients (n = 196, 73.4%) presenting emergently. We found no differences in age, sex, or BMI between the two groups. Emergent patients were more likely to be minorities, less likely to have insurance or a primary care physician, and 25% required an interpreter. Although a greater percentage of patients in the elective setting had chronic symptoms, most emergent patients also had duration of symptoms of months to years. After multivariable analysis, insurance status, lack of a primary care provider, and chronic duration of symptoms remained significant predictors of emergent presentation. Our findings indicate several targets for increasing access to elective surgical care. Most patients in the emergent group experienced chronic symptoms, indicating an opportunity to prevent emergency surgical treatment. This study provides local population characterization for improvements in access to care, which could lead to decreases in emergency gallbladder surgery."

    "abstract": "To examine loss of community-dwelling status 9 months after hospitalization for high-acuity emergency general surgery (HA-EGS) disease among older Americans. Retrospective analysis of claims data. US communities with Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare beneficiaries age 65 years or older hospitalized urgently/emergently between January 1, 2015, and March 31, 2015, with a principal diagnosis representing potential life or organ threat (necrotizing soft tissue infections, hernias with gangrene, ischemic enteritis, perforated viscus, toxic colitis or gastroenteritis, peritonitis, intra-abdominal hemorrhage) and an operation of interest on hospital days 1 or 2 (N = 3319). Demographic characteristics (age, race, and sex), comorbidities, principal diagnosis, complications, and index hospitalization disposition (died; discharged to skilled nursing facility [SNF], long-term acute care [LTAC], rehabilitation, hospice, home (with or without services), or acute care hospital; other) were measured. Survivors of index hospitalization were followed until December 31, 2015, on mortality and community-dwelling status (SNF/LTAC vs not). Descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier plots, and χ2 tests were used to describe and compare the cohort based on disposition. A multivariable logistic regression model, adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, complications, and discharge disposition, determined independent predictors of loss of community-dwelling status at 9 months. A total of 2922 (88%) survived index hospitalization. Likelihood of discharge to home decreased with increasing age, baseline comorbidities, and in-hospital complications. Overall, 418 (14.3%) HA-EGS survivors died during the follow-up period. Among those alive at 9 months, 10.3% were no longer community dwelling. Initial discharge disposition to any location other than home and three or more surgical complications during index hospitalization were independent predictors of residing in a SNF/LTAC 9 months after surviving HA-EGS. Older Americans, known to prioritize living in the community, will experience substantial loss of independence due to HA-EGS. Long-term expectations after surviving HA-EGS must be framed from the perspective of the outcomes that older patients value the most. Further research is needed to examine the quality-of-life burden of EGS survivorship prospectively. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:2289-2297, 2019."

    "abstract": "Purpose The objective of this study was to identify variables that predict a difficult laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed in an emergency setting. The secondary aim was to devise a pathway for patients admitted acutely that required a cholecystectomy. Methods Patients admitted to the Emergency General Surgery Department at Nottingham, the United Kingdom that had an emergency cholecystectomy performed during the one-year period from May 2016 to June 2017 were identified. Collected data included patient demographics, clinical presentation, biochemical analysis, radiological findings, subsequent interventions, surgical data, and clinical outcome. A difficult cholecystectomy was defined as operative time >60 minutes, conversion to an open procedure, or sub-total cholecystectomy performed.  Results A total of 149 patients were included. Cholecystitis was the most common diagnosis (n = 86, 57.7%), followed by acute pancreatitis (n = 36, 24.1%). Fifty-five (36.9%) patients had an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) >100 mg/dL. One hundred and twenty-one (81.2%) patients who had an emergency cholecystectomy were defined as \"difficult\". The overall morbidity rate was 15.4% (n = 23), and there was no post-operative in-hospital mortality. Univariate analysis showed that age >60 years (p = 0.012), underlying diagnosis (p = 0.010), presence of heart rate >90 (p = 0.027), and an elevated pre-surgery CRP >100 (p < 0.001) was associated with a difficult emergency cholecystectomy. Multi-variate analysis demonstrated that an elevated pre-surgery CRP >100 was an independent predictor of a difficult emergency cholecystectomy (p = 0.041). Conclusions An elevated pre-operative CRP is an independent predictor of a technically more difficult cholecystectomy in the emergency setting."

    "abstract": "In the last decade, emergency general surgery (EGS) in Australia and New Zealand has seen a transition from the traditional on-call system to the acute surgical unit (ASU) model. The importance and growing demand for EGS has resulted in the implementation of the General Surgeons Australia's 12-point plan for emergency surgery. Since its release, the 12-point plan has been used as a benchmark of a well-functioning ASU, both locally and abroad. This study aims to provide a descriptive review on the relevance of the 12-point plan to the ASU model and review the current evidence to support this framework. The review concludes that the establishment of the ASU model has met the aims set out by the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons for EGS. The 12-point plan is relevant and has good evidence to support its framework."

Improved understanding of hospital transfer patterns has a multitude of implications, including quality measurement. The objective of this study was to describe individual hospital transfer rates of mortal encounters. A retrospective review was undertaken from 2013 to 2015 of the Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission database. Two groups of EGS encounters were identified: encounters with death following transfer and encounters with death without transfer. The percentage of mortal encounters transferred was defined as the percentage of EGS hospital encounters with mortality initially presenting to a hospital transferred to another hospital before death at the receiving hospital. Overall, 370,242 total EGS encounters were included, with 17,003 (4.6%) of the total EGS encounters with mortality. Encounters with death without transfer encompassed 15,604 (91.8%) of mortal EGS encounters and encounters with death following transfer 1399 (8.2%). EGS disease categories of esophageal varices or perforation, necrotizing fasciitis, enterocutaneous fistula, and pancreatitis had over 10% of these total mortal encounters with death following transfer. For individual hospitals, percentage of mortal encounters transferred ranged from 0.8% to 35.2%. The percentage of mortal encounters transferred was inversely correlated with annual EGS hospital volume for all state hospitals (P < 0.001, r = -0.57). Broad variability in individual hospital practices exists for mortality transferred to other institutions. Application of this knowledge of percentage of mortal encounters transferred includes consideration in hospital quality metrics."

A retrospective review of the Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission database was undertaken from 2013 to 2015. EGS encounters were divided into three groups: encounters not transferred, encounters transferred from a hospital, and encounters transferred to a hospital. In total, 380,405 EGS encounters were identified, including 12,153 (3.2%) encounters transferred to a hospital, 10,163 (2.7%) encounters transferred from a hospital, and 358,089 (94.1%) encounters not transferred. For individual hospitals, percentage of encounters transferred to a hospital ranged from 0 to 30.05 per cent, encounters transferred from a hospital from 0.02 to 14.62 per cent, and encounters not transferred from 69.25 to 99.95 per cent of total encounters at individual hospitals. Percentage of encounters transferred from individual hospitals was inversely correlated with annual EGS hospital volume (P < 0.001, r = -0.59), whereas percentage of encounters transferred to individual hospitals was directly correlated with annual EGS hospital volume (P < 0.001, r = 0.51).

    "abstract": "As the geriatric population grows, the need for hospitals performing high quality emergency general surgery (EGS) on older patients will increase. Identifying clusters of high-performing geriatric emergency general surgery hospitals would substantiate the need for in-depth analyses of hospital-specific structures and practices that benefit older EGS patients. The objectives of this study were therefore to identify clusters of hospitals based on mortality performance for geriatric patients undergoing common EGS operations and to determine if hospital performance was similar for all operation types. Hospitals in the California State Inpatient Database were included if they performed a range of eight common EGS operations in patients 65 years or older, with a minimum requirement of three of each operation performed over 2 years. Multivariable beta regression models were created to define hospital-level risk-adjusted mortality. Centroid cluster analysis was used to identify groups of hospitals based on mortality and to determine if mortality-performance differed by operation. One hundred seven hospitals were included, performing a total of 24,279 operations in older patients. Hospitals separated into three distinct clusters: high, average, and low performers. The high-performing hospitals had survival rates 1 to 2 standard deviations better than the low-performers (p < 0.001). For each cluster, high performance in any one EGS operation consistently translated into high performance across all EGS operations. Hospitals conducting EGS operations in the geriatric patient population cluster into three distinct groups based on their survival performance. High-performing hospitals significantly outperform the average and low performers across every operation. The high-performers achieve reliable, high-quality results regardless of operation type. Further qualitative research is needed to investigate the perioperative drivers of hospital performance in the geriatric EGS population. Study Type Prognostic, level III."

    "abstract": "The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) has proposed a grading system for anatomic severity of 16 Emergency General Surgery conditions, including appendicitis. This is the first prospective, multicenter clinical study evaluating the AAST Appendicitis grading scale. The EAST Appendicitis study utilized data collected prospectively from 27 centers, between January 2017 to June 2018. An overall grade was assigned as the highest grade of the subscales: clinical, radiographic, operative, and pathologic. Grade 1-3 of the clinical subscale was assigned as Grade 1. Patients with a final diagnosis other than appendicitis were excluded. The cohort was divided into two groups: simple appendicitis (Grades 1 and 2), and complicated appendicitis (Grades 3, 4, and 5).Fisher's exact and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to determine association between the overall AAST grade and the following outcomes: infectious complications, Clavien-Dindo complications, hospital length of stay (LOS), 30-day emergency department visits, readmissions, and secondary interventions. A total of 2,909 cases were analyzed: 1,656 (57%) were Grade 1; 181 (6%), Grade 2; 399 (14%) Grade 4; and 549 (19%) Grade 5; 94% of patients underwent appendectomy. Index hospitalization LOS increased significantly with increasing grade: 1, [1,1], 1 [1,2], 1 [1,2], 2 [1,3], and 32,5 (p < 0.001). Infectious complications, Clavien-Dindo complications, hospital LOS, and secondary interventions were significantly associated with increasing AAST severity grade during index hospitalization. For 30-day outcomes, similar trends were noted for readmission, 30-day infections complications, 30-day cumulative infectious complications, 30-day Clavien-Dindo complications, 30-day cumulative Clavien-Dindo complications, 30-day secondary interventions, and 30-day cumulative secondary interventions.

This study demonstrates the use of the volumetric pulmonary artery (PA) catheter for estimation of Ea/Emax and describes trends of Ea/Emax, right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF), and pulmonary artery pulsatility index (PAPi) during initial 48hours of resuscitation in the trauma surgical intensive care unit (ICU). Review of prospectively collected data for 32 mechanically ventilated adult trauma and emergency general surgery patients enrolled within 6hours of admission to the ICU. Haemodynamics, recorded every 12hours for 48hours, were compared among survivors and non-survivors to hospital discharge. Mean age was 49±20 years, 69% were male, and 84% were trauma patients. Estimated Ea/Emax was associated with pulmonary vascular resistance and inversely related to pulmonary arterial capacitance and PA catheter derived RVEF. Seven (7) trauma patients did not survive to hospital discharge. Non-survivors had higher estimated Ea/Emax, suggesting right ventricular-pulmonary arterial uncoupling, with a statistically significant difference at 48hours (2.3±1.7 vs 1.0±0.58, p=0.018). RVEF was significantly lower in non-survivors at study initiation and at 48hours. PAPi did not show a consistent trend. Estimation of Ea/Emax using volumetric PA catheter is feasible. Serial assessment of RVEF and Ea/Emax may help in early identification of right heart dysfunction in critically ill mechanically ventilated patients at risk for acute right heart failure."

    "abstract": "The postoperative outcomes of emergency general surgery patients can be fraught with uncertainty. Although surgical risk calculators exist to predict 30-day mortality, they are often of limited utility in preparing patients and families for immediate perioperative complications. Examination of trends in mortality after emergent colectomy may help inform complex perioperative decision-making. We hypothesized that risk factors could be identified to predict early mortality (before postoperative day 5) to inform operative decisions. This analysis was a retrospective cohort study using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (2012-2014). Patients were stratified into three groups: early death (postoperative day 0-4), late death (postoperative day 5-30), and those who survived. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore characteristics associated with early death. Kaplan-Meier models and Cox regression were used to further characterize their impact. A total of 18 803 patients were analyzed. Overall 30-day mortality was 12.5% (3316); of these, 37.1% (899) were early deaths. The preoperative factors most predictive of early death were septic shock (OR 3.62, p<0.001), ventilator dependence (OR 2.81, p<0.001), and ascites (OR 1.63, p<0.001). Postoperative complications associated with early death included pulmonary embolism (OR 5.78, p<0.001), presence of new-onset or ongoing postoperative septic shock (OR 4.45, p<0.001) and new-onset renal failure (OR 1.89, p<0.001). Patients with both preoperative and postoperative shock had an overall mortality rate of 47% with over half of all deaths occurring in the early period. Nearly 40% of patients who die after emergent colon resection do so before postoperative day 5. Early mortality is heavily influenced by the presence of both preoperative and new or persistent postoperative septic shock. These results demonstrate important temporal trends of mortality, which may inform perioperative patient and family discussions and complex management decisions. Level III. Study type: Prognostic."

    "abstract": "Few diseases truly require emergency surgery today. We investigated the relationship between access to operating room (OR) and outcomes for patients with life-threatening emergency general surgery (LT-EGS) diseases at US hospitals. In 2015, we surveyed 2,811 US hospitals on EGS practices, including how OR access is assured (e.g., OR staffing, block time). There were 1,690 (60%) hospitals that responded. We anonymously linked survey data to 2015 Statewide Inpatient Sample data (17 states) using American Hospital Association identifiers. Adults admitted with life-threatening diagnoses (e.g., necrotizing fasciitis, perforated viscus) who underwent operative intervention the same calendar day as hospital admission were included. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Univariate and multivariable regression analyses, clustered by treating hospital and adjusted for patient factors, were performed to examine hospital-level OR access variables. Overall, 3,620 patients were admitted with LT-EGS diseases. The median age was 63 years (interquartile range, 51-75), with half having three or more comorbidities (50%). Thirty-four percent had one or more major systemic complication, and 5% died. The majority got care at hospitals with less than 1 day of EGS block time but with policies to ensure emergency access to the OR. After adjusting for age, sex, race, insurance status, comorbidities, systemic complications, and surgical complications, we found that less presence of an in-house EGS surgeon, compared with around the clock, was associated with increased mortality (rarely/never in-house surgeon: odds ratio, 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI],1.1-5.3; sometimes in-house surgeon: odds ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3). In addition, after controlling for other factors, on-call overnight recovery room nurse, compared with in-house, was associated with an increased mortality (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.5-3.1). Round-the-clock availability of personnel, specifically emergency general surgeons and recovery room nurses, is associated with decreased mortality. These findings have implications for the creation of EGS patient triage criteria and Acute Care Surgery Centers of Excellence. Therapeutic, level III."

There are limited data addressing outcomes of emergency general surgery (EGS) in this population. The aim of our study was to characterize the breadth of surgical consults from the MICU and assess mortality after abdominal EGS cases. All MICU patients with an EGS consult in an academic medical center between January 2010 and 2016 were identified from an electronic medical record-based registry. Charts were reviewed to determine reason for consult, procedures performed, and to obtain additional clinical data. A multivariate logistic regression was used to determine patient factors associated with patient mortality. Of 911 MICU patients seen by our service, 411(45%) required operative intervention, with 186 patients undergoing an abdominal operation. The postoperative mortality rate after abdominal operations was 37% (69/186), significantly higher than the mortality of 16% (1833/11192) for all patients admitted to the MICU over the same period (p < 0.05). Damage-control procedures were performed in 64 (34%) patients, with 46% mortality in this group.

To further explore surgical futility, we examined the incidence and factors associated with extreme-risk patients undergoing major emergency general surgery with early death. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was reviewed for all adults undergoing colectomy, small bowel resection, control of bleeding ulcer, lysis of adhesion, and exploratory laparotomy between 2007 and 2015. Extreme-risk was defined as having an estimated mortality risk ≥75% using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program mortality-risk calculator. Futile care was defined as extreme-risk patients who died within 48 hours of an operation. The incidence of, and clinical factors associated with, futile surgery were identified. Of 94,350 emergency general surgery patients, 1.9% were extreme-risk. Among extreme-risk patients, 30-day mortality was 71.2%; 31.6% of extreme-risk patients died within 48 hours, representing futile care. Only 5.5% of extreme-risk patients were discharged home. Patients who were >80 years (odds ratio [OR] 6.25 vs 40-64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.51-8.66), septic (OR 4.63; 95% CI, 3.38-6.34), or had a dependent functional status (OR 2.50 vs independent; 95% CI, 1.83-3.43]) had higher odds of having a futile operation. A significant number of emergency general surgery operations were on extreme-risk patients who suffered early death, which may indicate futile care. Surgeons face numerous conflicting pressures when asked to perform potentially futile surgery. Additional research in the decision-making process in these cases is needed to understand why surgeons operate in such dire circumstances and whether they should."

We conducted a national survey on EGS structures and processes to examine if implementation of acute care surgery (ACS) would improve OR accessibility compared with a traditional general surgeon on call (GSOC) approach. We surveyed 2,811 acute care general hospitals in the United States capable of EGS care. The questionnaire included queries regarding structures and processes related to OR access and on the model of EGS care (ACS vs. GSOC). Associations between the EGS care model and structures and processes to ensure OR access were measured using univariate and multivariate models (adjusted for hospital characteristics). Of 1,690 survey respondents (60.1%), 1,497 reported ACS or GSOC. 272 (18.2%) utilized an ACS model. The ACS hospitals were more likely to have more than 5 days of block time and a tiered system of booking urgent/emergent cases compared with GSOC hospitals (34.2% vs. 7.4% and 85.3% vs. 57.6%, respectively; all p values <0.001). Surgeons at ACS hospitals were more likely to be free of competing clinical duties, be in-house overnight, and cover at a single hospital overnight when covering EGS (40.1% vs. 4.7%, 64.7% vs. 25.6%, and 84.9% vs. 64.9%, respectively; all p values <0.001). The ACS hospitals were more likely to have overnight in-house scrub techs, OR nurses, and recovery room nurses (69.9% vs. 13.8%, 70.6% vs. 13.9%, and 45.6% vs. 5.4%, respectively; all p values <0.001). On multivariable analysis, ACS hospitals had higher odds of all structures and processes that would improve OR access. The ACS implementation is associated with factors that may improve OR access.

How this training varies between programs is not well characterized. We sought to describe the variation in clinical exposure between residencies in a sample of residents applying to an ACS fellowship. We hypothesized that applicants have significant variations in clinical exposure as well as unique and specific expectations for educational experiences. We offered an anonymous 82-question survey focused on residency clinical exposure and self-perceived confidence in key areas of ACS training, as well as fellowship training and career expectations to all applicants interviewed at a single trauma, critical care, and emergency surgery fellowship program. Responses were assessed via absolute numbers and confidence via a 5-point Likert scale; data are reported using descriptive statistics and linear regression models. Forty-two interviewing applicants completed the survey, for a 96% response rate. Applicants reported heterogeneous levels of comfort across most ACS domains. There was good correlation between experience and comfort in most procedural areas. During fellowship training, respondents placed highest priority on operative experience, with 43% rating this as their highest priority, followed by penetrating trauma experience (33%). We found significant variations in both experience and comfort within key ACS domains among fellowship applicants. Despite training variability, there was good correlation between experience and self-reported comfort.

    "abstract": "In sub-Saharan Africa, surgical access is limited by an inadequate surgical workforce, lack of infrastructure and decreased care-seeking by patients. Delays in treatment can result from delayed presentation (pre-hospital), delays in transfer (intrafacility) or after arrival at the treating centre (in-hospital delay; IHD). This study evaluated the effect of IHD on mortality among patients undergoing emergency general surgery and identified factors associated with IHD. Utilizing Malawi's Kamuzu Central Hospital Emergency General Surgery database, data were collected prospectively from September 2013 to November 2017. Included patients had a diagnosis considered to warrant urgent or emergency intervention for surgery. Bivariable analysis and Poisson regression modelling was done to determine the effect of IHD (more than 24 h) on mortality, and identify factors associated with IHD. Of 764 included patients, 281 (36·8 per cent) had IHDs.

    "abstract": "The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) is a composite scale formulated by the Centers for Disease Control and is geocoded as a percentile ranking at the census tract level. SVI is potentially applicable to assess risk and target populations that are likely to present emergently for disease that could have been treated electively and target local disparities. We applied the SVI to compare cholecystectomy patients presenting emergently versus electively. We identified patients who had undergone cholecystectomy at our academic medical center over a 6-month period. We abstracted patient demographics, chronic symptom duration, and diagnosis from the medical record. Patient addresses were geocoded to identify their census tract of residence and estimated SVI. Two hundred and fifty five patients met inclusion criteria. Most patients (n = 185, 72.5%) had surgery in the emergent setting. Emergent patients lived in areas of greater social vulnerability compared with elective patients (median SVI 75th versus 64th percentile, P < 0.001). On multivariable analysis adjusting for chronicity of symptoms and patient proximity to the hospital, having high SVI (>70th percentile) was associated with higher odds of undergoing an emergent versus an elective procedure (OR 2.05, P = 0.04). The SVI has potential utility for examining health care disparities, performing comparably with a more complex model including individual risk factors. Because it is a composite measure geocoded at the census tract level for all communities in the United States, it has potential for targeting relatively discrete geographic areas for intervention. Being a geocoded measure also offers opportunity for linking with other data sets using geographic information systems."

Our goal was to determine current differences in organism prevalence and outcomes for NSTI and non-necrotizing severe soft tissue infections across the United States. We hypothesized that there were geographical differences in organism prevalence that would lead to differences in outcomes. This study was a retrospective multi-institutional trial from centers across the United States and Canada. Demographic, clinical, and outcomes data were collected. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were performed to determine the effects of region and microbiology on outcomes. A total of 622 patients were included in this study. Polymicrobial infections (45%) were the most prevalent infections in all regions. On bivariate analysis, Clostridium and polymicrobial infections had higher mean Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis scores and American Association for the Surgery of Trauma grades (P < 0.001 for both) than other organisms. Patients in the South were more likely to be uninsured and had worse unadjusted outcomes. In a risk-adjusted model, increasing American Association for the Surgery of Trauma grade was predictive of mortality (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.6-3.1; P < 0.001), as was age ≥ 55 y (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.3-5.3, P = 0.006), but region and organism type were not associated with mortality. We found important regional differences with respect to organism type and demographics. However, on risk-adjusted models, neither region nor organism type predicted mortality."

    "abstract": "We aimed to enhance the emergency general surgical service in our high-volume centre in order to reduce four-hour target breaches, to expedite senior decision making and to avoid unnecessary admissions. The aggregation of marginal gains theory was applied. A dual consultant on-call system was established by the incremental employment of five emergency general surgeons with a specialist interest in colorectal or oesophagogastric surgery. A surgical ambulatory care unit, which combines consultant-led clinical review with dedicated next-day radiology slots, and a dedicated working week half-day gastrointestinal urgent theatre session were instituted to facilitate ambulatory care pathways. The presence of two consultant surgeons being on call during weekday working hours decreased the four-hour target breaches and allowed consultant presence in the surgical ambulatory care clinic and the gastrointestinal urgent theatre list. Of 1371 surgical ambulatory care clinic appointments within 30 months, 1135 (82.7%) avoided a hospital admission, corresponding to savings of £309,752 . The coordinated functioning of the surgical ambulatory care clinic and the gastrointestinal urgent theatre list resulted in statistically significantly reduced hospital stays for patients operated for abscess drainage (gastrointestinal urgent theatre median 11 hours (interquartile range 3, 38) compared with emergency median 31 hours (interquartile range 24, 53), P < 0.001) or diagnostic laparoscopy/appendicectomy (gastrointestinal urgent theatre median 52 hours (interquartile range 41, 71) compared with emergency median 61 hours (interquartile range 43, 99), P = 0.005). Overnight surgery was reduced with only surgery that was absolutely necessary occurring out of hours. The expansion of the 'traditional' on-call surgical team, the establishment of the surgical ambulatory care clinic and the gastrointestinal urgent theatre list led to marginal gains with a reduction in unnecessary inpatient stays, expedited decision making and improved financial efficiency."

The aims of this study therefore were: 1) to investigate whether the acute cholecystectomy rate is a valid process indicator; and 2) to use this rate to examine variation in the provision of acute cholecystectomy in England. The Surgical Workload and Outcomes Research Database (SWORD), derived from the Hospital Episode Statistics database, was interrogated for the 2012-2017 financial years. All adult patients admitted with acute biliary pancreatitis, cholecystitis or biliary colic to hospitals in England were included and the acute cholecystectomy rate in each one examined. A total of 328,789 patients were included, of whom 42,642 (12.9%) underwent an acute cholecystectomy. The acute cholecystectomy rate varied significantly between hospitals, with the overall rate ranging from 1.2% to 36.5%. This variation was consistent across all disease groupings and time periods, and was independent of the annual number of procedures performed by each NHS trust. In 41 (29.9%) trusts, fewer than one in ten patients with acute gallbladder disease underwent cholecystectomy within two weeks. The acute cholecystectomy rate is easily measurable using routine administrative datasets, modifiable by local services and has a strong evidence base linking it to patient outcomes. We therefore advocate that it is an ideal process indicator that should be used in quality monitoring and improvement. Using it, we identified significant variation in the quality of care for acute biliary disease in England."

The degree to which the EGS model delivers these benefits is debated. We performed a systematic review of the literature to identify whether the EGS service model is associated with greater efficiency and improved outcomes compared to the traditional model. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science (Core Collection) databases from their earliest date of coverage through March 2017. Primary outcomes for efficiency of care were surgical response time, time to operation and total length of stay in hospital. The primary outcome for evaluating patient outcomes was total complication rate. The EGS service model generally improved efficiency of care and patient outcomes, but the outcome variables reported in the literature varied. Development of standardized metrics and comprehensive EGS databases would support quality control and performance improvement in EGS systems. Des modèles dédiés de services de chirurgie générale d’urgence (CGU) ont été développés pour améliorer l’efficience des soins et les résultats chez les patients. On ne s’entend toutefois pas sur l’ampleur des bénéfices conférés par le modèle CGU.

Les paramètres principaux pour l’efficience des soins étaient le temps de réponse, le délai avant l’intervention et la durée totale du séjour hospitalier. Le paramètre principal pour l’évaluation des résultats chez les patients était le taux de complications total. Le modèle de service CGU améliore généralement l’efficience des soins et les résultats chez les patients, mais dans la littérature, les paramètres mesurés varient.

    "abstract": "The Acute Care Surgery (ACS) model has been widely adopted by hospitals across the United States, with ACS services managing emergency general surgery (EGS) patients previously treated by general surgery (GS) services. We evaluated the operational and financial impact of an ACS service model on general surgeons at an academic medical center. Using WiseOR® (Palo Alto, CA), we compared surgical case volumes for the GS service two years before (October, 2013 - September, 2015) and two years after (October, 2015 - September, 2017) implementation of an ACS service at the University of Vermont Medical Center. From financial reports, we obtained monthly wRVUs, clinical FTEs, net patient revenue, and payer mix for the GS service and compared the two years before and after ACS model implementation. There was a significant reduction in the average number of cases performed by the GS service following ACS service implementation (monthly mean ± SD, 139.1 ± 16.0 vs. 116.7 ± 14.0, p < 0.001). The normal-hours caseload remained stable, while a significant decrease in after-hours cases accounted for the reduction in overall volume. Despite the reduction in operative volume, the decrease in mean monthly wRVU/FTE for the GS service when comparing the pre- and post- ACS periods did not reach statistical significance (614.9 ± 82.9 vs. 576.3 ± 62.1, p = 0.08).There was a significant increase in average monthly clinic-derived wRVU/FTE for the GS service (106.3 ± 13.5 vs. 120.5 ± 16.4, p = 0.007). Shifting EGS patient management from the GS to ACS service did not negatively impact the productivity of the GS service."

    "abstract": "Trauma and emergency general surgery (EGS) patients who are uninsured have worse outcomes as compared with insured patients. Partially modeled after the 2006 Massachusetts Healthcare Reform (MHR), the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010 with the goal of expanding health insurance coverage, primarily through state-based Medicaid expansion (ME). We evaluated the impact of ME and MHR on outcomes for trauma patients, EGS patients, and trauma systems. This study was approved by the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma Guidelines Committee. Using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology, we defined three populations of interest (trauma patients, EGS patients, and trauma systems) and identified the critical outcomes (mortality, access to care, change in insurance status, reimbursement, funding). We performed a systematic review of the literature. Random effect meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses were calculated for outcomes with sufficient data. From 4,593 citations, we found 18 studies addressing all seven predefined outcomes of interest for trauma patients, three studies addressing six of seven outcomes for EGS patients, and three studies addressing three of eight outcomes for trauma systems. On meta-analysis, trauma patients were less likely to be uninsured after ME or MHR (odds ratio, 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.37-0.66). These coverage expansion policies were not associated with a change in the odds of inpatient mortality for trauma (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.88-1.05). Emergency general surgery patients also experienced a significant insurance coverage gains and no change in inpatient mortality. Insurance expansion was often associated with increased access to postacute care at discharge. The evidence for trauma systems was heterogeneous. Given the evidence quality, we conditionally recommend ME/MHR to improve insurance coverage and access to postacute care for trauma and EGS patients. We have no specific recommendation with respect to the impact of ME/MHR on trauma systems. Additional research into these questions is needed. Review, Economic/Decision, level III."

    "abstract": "The Failure to Rescue (FTR) rate is defined as the mortality rate among patients who experience one or more complications. It has been used as an outcome metric for approximately 25 years, primarily in elective surgery populations, and has been shown to be associated with factors that are modifiable on the institutional level. Although the FTR metric was derived in elective surgical populations, modifications have been made in attempts to refine the metric and apply it to broader populations, including medical patients and non-elective surgical patients. However, study among emergency general surgery patients has been limited. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge surrounding FTR, including established risk factors and potential limitations of the metric in emergency general surgery (EGS) populations. We then discuss a conceptual model for FTR events and review strategies to minimize rates. Finally, we provide a brief overview of current areas of study and potential future directions in acute care surgery. In this review we have summarized the various definitions used to create FTR metrics, the institutional and patient factors associated with FTR, and what is currently known about efforts to reduce FTR rates at the individual center level. While much has been published in recent years on FTR in elective populations, the trauma and emergency surgery populations and their inherent differences are still being described. Further elucidation and correction of factors contributing to institutional FTR rates across subspecialties may lead to improved patient outcomes, and future research focused on the events immediately preceding the decompensation of a patient may yield critical insights."

    "abstract": "Classical medical teaching has made a clear distinction between signs and symptoms, and diagnosis. However, at the time of ward admission, a diagnosis may remain unclear. We propose administrative pressures during the admission process may have reduced the ability for pathological diagnosis. This may result in increased hospitalisation for investigation of signs and symptoms, rather than for treatment of clear diagnoses. We sought to further clarify this hypothesis and investigate changes in the nature of admissions during the last two decades in an adult emergency general surgery service. A retrospective analysis of emergency general surgical admissions during four six-month time periods, between 2000 and 2018, was conducted. The six-month periods were spaced evenly during the 18-year study. Demographic information, emergency department length of stay, incidence of a pathological diagnosis on ward admission and accuracy of admission diagnosis were analysed. 2763 patients were admitted in the four six-month time periods. A significant reduction in number of patients admitted with a pathological diagnosis was noted between the 2012 and 2018 study periods (p < 0.05), with 21.2% of patients admitted in 2018 for investigation of signs and symptoms. The incidence of an accurate admission diagnosis (as assessed by the discharge diagnosis) ranged from 62.3 to 63.6% and did not differ significantly by year. Between 2012 and 2018, there was a significant increase in the number of emergency general surgical patients admitted for investigation of signs and symptoms. However, accuracy of admission diagnosis was unchanged during the study period."

Of 108,954 EGS patients, 1,366 patients (1.3%) developed a VTE postoperatively. The median time to diagnosis was 9 days [5-16] for DVTs and 8 days [5-16] for PEs. Operating room time of 100 min or more was associated with increased risk of developing a DVT (OR 1.30 [1.12-2.21]) and PE (OR:1.25 [1.11-2.43]) with a 7% and 5% respective increase for every 10 min increase after the 100 min. Other independent predictors of VTE complications were older age, and history of cancer, and emergent colectomies on procedure-level analysis. Prolonged operating room time is independently associated with increased risk of developing VTE complications after an EGS procedure. Most of the VTE complications were delayed in presentation."

    "abstract": "Acute care surgery (ACS) diagnoses are responsible for approximately a quarter of the costs of inpatient care in the US government, and individuals will be responsible for a larger share of the costs of this healthcare as the population ages. ACS as a specialty thus has the opportunity to meet a significant healthcare need, and by optimizing care delivery models do so in a way that improves both quality and value. ACS practice models that have maintained or added emergency general surgery (EGS) and even elective surgery have realized more operative case volume and surgeon satisfaction. However, vulnerabilities exist in the ACS model. Payer mix in a practice varies by geography and distribution of EGS, trauma, critical care, and elective surgery. Critical care codes constitute approximately 25% of all billing by acute care surgeons, so even small changes in reimbursement in critical care can have significant impact on professional revenue. Staffing an ACS practice can be challenging depending on reimbursement and due to uneven geographic distribution of available surgeons. Empowered by an understanding of economics, using team-oriented leadership inherent to trauma surgeons, and in partnership with healthcare organizations and regulatory bodies, ACS surgeons are positioned to significantly influence the future of healthcare in the USA."

For five of the most common EGS conditions, acute appendicitis, acute cholecystitis, acute diverticulitis, acute pancreatitis, and small bowel obstruction, we found multiple well-referenced guidelines published by leading professional organizations. We have summarized guideline recommendations for each of these disease states stratified by the AAST EGS anatomic severity score based on these published consensus guidelines. These summaries could be used to help inform evidence-based clinical decision-making, but are intended to be flexible and updatable in real time as further research emerges.

A prospective cost analysis of emergency general surgery patients 65 years of age and older was conducted. Demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained. Preadmission Clinical Frailty Scale score and Clavien-Dindo postoperative complications were collected. Patients were followed for 6 months after discharge. Hospitalization costs were calculated using the Alberta Health Services (AHS) microcosting database; other costs were obtained from Alberta Health Services and Alberta Health databases. The primary outcome was total insured cost (2016 Can$). Multivariate generalized linear regression of log-transformed costs was conducted. Overall, 321 patients were enrolled. Mean age was 76.1 years (standard deviation 7.8), median Clinical Frailty Scale was 3, mean length of stay was 15.9 days (standard deviation 23.4), and 48% suffered a complication.

Costs increased-after adjusting for age, comorbidities, and preadmission function as frailty-and American Society of Anesthesiologists score increased if minor or major complications occurred. The detection of frailty represents an opportunity to target risk-reduction strategies and interventions to improve outcomes and decrease cost."

Optimizing outcomes can require a structured system of surgical care based on key quality indicators. To investigate this, the current study sought to answer 2 questions. First, to what degree does hospital emergency operative volume impact mortality for geriatric patients undergoing emergency general surgery (EGS) operations? Second, at what procedure-specific hospital volume will geriatric patients undergoing an emergency operation achieve at or better than average mortality risk? Retrospective cohort study of geriatric patients (aged 65 years and older) who underwent 1 of 10 EGS operations identified from the California State Inpatient Database (2010 to 2011). β-Logistic generalized linear regression was used, with the hospital as the unit of analysis, to investigate the relationship between hospital operative volume and in-hospital riskv-adjusted mortality. Hospital operative volume thresholds to optimize probability of survival were defined. There were 41,860 operations evaluated at 299 hospitals. For each operation, mortality decreased as hospital emergency operative volume increased (p < 0.001 for each operation); for every standardized increase in volume (meaning +1 natural logarithm of volume), the reduction in mortality ranged from 14% for colectomy to 61% for appendectomy. Hospital volume thresholds, which optimize to 95% probability of survival, varied by procedure, with a mean of 14 operations over 2 years. More than 50% of hospitals did not meet the threshold benchmarks, representing 22% of patients. Survival rates for geriatric patients were improved substantially when emergency operations were performed at hospitals with higher operative volumes. Consistent with all active Quality Programs of the American College of Surgeons, hospital operative volume appears to be an important metric of surgical quality for older patients undergoing emergency operations."

In this retrospective cohort study, patients undergoing appendicectomy 2.5 years before (Traditional group) or after (ASU group) this date were compared. Primary outcomes were median length of stay, median time from emergency department referral to theatre start and proportion of cases performed in-hours. Secondary outcomes were rates of complications, open appendicectomy, consultant scrubbed for procedure, intensive care unit admission and re-presentation to emergency department within 30 days. After removing those with incomplete data, 1214 patients were enrolled; 465 in the Traditional group and 749 in the ASU group. There were no significant baseline differences between groups.

We determined patient- and hospital-level factors associated with interhospital EGS transfers, a critical first step to identifying which patients may require transfer. Adult EGS patients (defined by American Association for the Surgery of Trauma International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis codes) were identified within the 2008-2013 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (n = 17,175,450). Patient- and hospital-level factors were examined as predictors of transfer to another acute care hospital with a multivariate proportional cause-specific hazards model with a competing risk analysis to assess the effect of risk factors for transfer. 1.8% of encounters resulted in a transfer (n = 318,286). Transferred patients were on average 62 y old and most commonly had Medicare (52.9% [n = 168,363]), private (26.7% [n = 84,991]), or Medicaid insurance (10.8% [n = 34,279]). 67.7% were white. The most common EGS diagnoses among transferred patients were related to hepatic-pancreatic-biliary (n = 90,989 [28.6%]) and upper gastrointestinal tract (n = 60,088 [18.9%]) conditions. Most transferred patients (n = 269,976 [84.8%]) did not have a procedure before transfer. Transfer was more likely if patients were in small (hazard ratio 2.52, 95% confidence interval 2.28-2.79) or medium (1.32, 1.21-1.44) versus large facilities, government (1.19, 1.11-1.28) versus private facilities, and rural (4.58, 3.98-5.27) or urban nonteaching (1.89, 1.70-2.10) versus urban teaching facilities. Patient-level factors were not strong predictors of transfer. We identified that hospital-level characteristics more strongly predicted the need for transfer than patient-related factors. Consideration of these factors by providers as care is delivered in the context of the resources and capabilities of local institutions may facilitate transfer decision-making."

American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program defines emergency surgery as one that is performed no later than 12 hours after admission or symptom onset. Using all the ACS-NSQIP demographic, preoperative (comorbidities, laboratory variables), intraoperative (e.g., duration of surgery, wound classification), and postoperative variables (i.e., complications), we created multivariable linear regression models to predict LOS. LOS was treated as a continuous variable, and the degree to which the models could explain the variation in LOS for each type of surgery was measured using the coefficient of determination (R).

In summary, the median LOS ranged between 1 day for appendectomies (n = 124, 426) and cholecystectomies (n = 21,699) and 8 days for colectomies (n = 19,557) and small intestine resections (n = 7,782). The R for all clinical factors ranged between 0.28 for cholecystectomy and 0.44 for hernia repair, suggesting that 56% to 72% of the LOS variation for each of the six procedures studied cannot be explained by the wide range of clinical factors included in ACS-NSQIP. Most of the LOS variation is not explained by clinical factors and may be explained by nonclinical factors (e.g., logistical delays, insurance type). Further studies should evaluate these nonclinical factors to identify target areas for quality improvement. Epidemiological study, level III."

    "title": "Defining the Three Delays in Referral of Surgical Emergencies from District Hospitals to University Teaching Hospital of Kigali, Rwanda.",
    "abstract": "Surgical conditions represent up to 30% of the global burden of diseases. The aim of this study was to assess the delays in patients transferred to a tertiary referral hospital from district hospitals (DHs) in Rwanda with emergency general surgery (EGS) conditions. We performed a prospective review of all EGS patients referred from DH over a 3-month period to assess delays in transfer and accessing care. We then surveyed general practitioners to define their perspective on delays in surgical care. Over a 3-month period, there were 86 patients transferred from DH with EGS conditions. The most common diagnoses were bowel obstruction (n = 22, 26%) and trauma (n = 19, 22%). The most common performed operations were laparotomy (n = 21, 24%) and bowel resection (n = 20, 23%). The mortality rate was 12%, and the intensive care unit admission rate was 4%. In transfer to the referral hospital, 5% patients were delayed for financial reasons and 2% due to lack of insurance. After reaching CHUK, 5% patients were delayed due to laboratory and radiology issues. Other delays included no operating theater available (4%) and no surgeon available (1%). Providers' perceptions for not performing surgeries at DH were predominantly the lack of a competent surgical provider or anesthesia staff. EGS patients represent a broad range of diagnoses. Delays were noted at each step in the referral process with multiple areas for potential improvement. Expanding surgical access at the DH has the potential to decrease delays and thereby improves patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) patients require greater resources and have increased rates of morbidity and mortality. Previous work has shown mortality differences in colectomy patients between direct admissions and transfers patients based on source, including emergency department, inpatient, and nursing home transfers. We hypothesize that patient transfer status negatively effects morbidity, mortality, and resource utilization in a mixed population of EGS patients. Data were obtained for patients undergoing EGS using public files from the American College of Surgeons National Surgery Quality Improvement Program for the years 2014 through 2016. We analyzed risk factors and 30-day outcomes by transfer status on frequently performed procedures using χ analysis and multivariable logistic regression. Significance was set at p < 0.001 for the bivariate analyses and p < 0.05 for the multivariable analyses. A total of 167,636 procedures were identified. Transferred patients had increased clinical risk, operative complexity, and poorer outcomes. Fewer transfers were initiated for less technically sophisticated cases such as laparoscopic appendectomy and cholecystectomy, whereas more complex acute open cases were more often transferred. Transfer patients required longer operations and more transfusions and experienced more complications likely to require an intensive care unit stay. Transfer patients returned to the operating room more often, had higher rates of readmission, and greater 30-day mortality. These effects remained after adjusting for procedure group, secondary procedures, age, sex, and American Society of Anesthesiologists class. Our study demonstrates significant increases in mortality, morbidity, and resource utilization in EGS transfer patients who were not attributable to case mix, demographics, and comorbid status alone. These data point to potential financial and quality assessment challenges for tertiary referral centers. Prognostic, level III; therapeutic, level IV."

    "abstract": "Expected performance rates for various outcome metrics are a hallmark of hospital quality indicators used by Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and National Quality Forum. The identification of outlier hospitals with above- and below-expected mortality for emergency general surgery (EGS) operations is therefore of great value for EGS quality improvement initiatives. The aim of this study was to determine hospital variation in mortality after EGS operations, and compare characteristics between outlier hospitals. Using data from the California State Inpatient Database (2010-2011), we identified patients who underwent one of eight common EGS operations. Expected mortality was obtained from a Bayesian model, adjusting for both patient- and hospital-level variables. A hospital-level standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was constructed (ratio of observed to expected deaths). Only hospitals performing three or more of each operation were included. An \"outlier\" hospital was defined as having an SMR with 80% confidence interval that did not cross 1.0. High- and low-mortality SMR outliers were compared. There were 140,333 patients included from 220 hospitals. Standardized mortality ratio varied from a high of 2.6 (mortality, 160% higher than expected) to a low of 0.2 (mortality, 80% lower than expected); 12 hospitals were high SMR outliers, and 28 were low SMR outliers. Standardized mortality was over three times worse in the high SMR outliers compared with the low SMR outliers (1.7 vs. 0.5; p < 0.001). Hospital-, patient-, and operative-level characteristics were equivalent in each outlier group. There exists significant hospital variation in standardized mortality after EGS operations. High SMR outliers have significant excess mortality, while low SMR outliers have superior EGS survival. Common hospital-level characteristics do not explain the wide gap between underperforming and overperforming outlier institutions. These findings suggest that SMR can help guide assessment of EGS performance across hospitals; further research is essential to identify and define the hospital processes of care which translate into optimal EGS outcomes.

Therefore, emergency laparotomy/thoracotomy is performed in the emergency department (ED). The present study was conducted to assess the safety of this practice. The data were reviewed from 88 patients who underwent emergency trauma laparotomy and/or thoracotomy performed by our acute care surgery group during the period from April 2013 to December 2017. Operation was performed in the ED for 43 of 88 patients (51%, ED group), and in the OR for 45 of 88 patients (49%, OR group). The perioperative outcomes of the two groups were compared. Compared with the OR group, the ED group had a higher Injury Severity Score (30±15 vs. 13±10, p<0.01), greater incidence of blunt trauma (74% (32/43) vs. 36% (16/45), p<0.01), larger volume of red blood cell transfusion (18±18 units vs. 5±10 units, p<0.01), higher incidence of new-onset shock after sedation among patients who received sedation in the ED (59% (17/29) vs. 25% (6/24), p<0.01), and higher in-hospital mortality rate (49% (21/43) vs. 0, p<0.01). All five patients who underwent laparotomy followed by thoracotomy died in the ED; none of these patients underwent preoperative placement of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA). Of the 21 patients in the ED group who died, 17 (81%) died immediately postoperatively; furthermore, 12 of the 22 patients who survived (55%) were not in shock prior to operation. Emergency trauma laparotomy and/or thoracotomy outcomes were related to injury severity. The resources for trauma operations in the ED seemed suboptimal. The outcome of trauma operations may be improved by reviewing the protocols for anesthetic care, and by the usage of REBOA rather than aortic cross-clamping. IV."

The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) was examined for patients with a history of BMT between 2001 and 2014. There were 520,000 HST admissions meeting inclusion criteria, of which, 14,143 (2.7%) required EGS. Of those requiring EGS, 378 (2.7%) were during engraftment admission and 13,765 (97.3%) on subsequent admission. For those requiring EGS during subsequent admission, 9,920 (72.1%) had a history of GVHD and 3,845 (27.9%) did not. On multivariate analysis, requirement of EGS was associated with mortality (OR: 1.71, 95%CI: 1.47-1.99, p < 0.001). For patients requiring EGS, engraftment admission or GVHD was not associated with mortality. While EGS results in worse survival for the HST population, patients in their engraftment admission do not appear to be at increased mortality risk. In addition, GVHD does not worsen survival."

Different systems such as NCEPOD classification and Timing of Acute Care Surgery classification have been developed for the timing of the emergency surgery. The aim of the study was to find out how well planned urgency class is being implemented. The planned and realized waiting times for all emergency surgeries were studied during the 6-month period in the Oulu University Hospital. The catchment area of the hospital includes a population of 742,000. The urgency in the hospital is planned in a four-step scale: an extremely urgent (E) patient should be taken immediately to the operating theater. Class I urgency surgery should start within 3 h (180 min), class II within 8 h (480 min), and class III within 24 h (1440 min). Surgeon plans urgency at his discretion, and no specific urgency has been imposed on certain diagnoses thus the surgeon's perceptions of the illness or trauma affects the assessment. Extreme urgent patients had an average waiting time of 26 min. For class I patient, the average waiting time was 59 min, while 93% of surgeries were started within the target time. For class II and class III patients, these figures were 337 min and 86% and 830 min and 78%, respectively. With regard to urgency, the higher the degree of urgency, the greater the chance of the surgery being realized within the planned time."

    "abstract": "Blunt abdominal trauma can lead to substantial organ injury and hemorrhage necessitating open abdominal surgery. Currently, the trend in surgeon training is shifting away from general surgery and the surgical treatment of blunt abdominal trauma patients is often done by sub-specialized surgeons. The aim of this study was to identify what emergency procedures are needed after blunt abdominal trauma and whether they can be performed with the skill set of a general surgeon. The records of blunt abdominal trauma patients requiring emergency laparotomy (n = 100) over the period 2006-2016 (Helsinki University Hospital Trauma Registry) were reviewed. The organ injuries and the complexity of the procedures were evaluated. A total of 89 patients (no need for complex skills, NCS) were treated with the skill set of general surgeons while 11 patients required complex skills. Complex skills patients were more severely injured (New Injury Severity Score 56.4 vs 35.9, p < 0.001) and had a lower systolic blood pressure (mean: 89 vs 112, p = 0.044) and higher mean shock index (heart rate/systolic blood pressure: 1.43 vs 0.95, p = 0.012) on admission compared with NCS patients. The top three NCS procedures were splenectomy (n = 33), bowel repair (n = 31), and urinary bladder repair (n = 16). In patients requiring a complex procedure (CS), the bleeding site was the liver (n = 7) or a major blood vessel (n = 4). The majority of patients requiring emergency laparotomy can be managed with the skills of a general surgeon. Non-responder blunt abdominal trauma patients with positive ultrasound are highly likely to require complex skills. The future training of surgeons should concentrate on NCS procedures while at the same time recognizing those injuries requiring complex skills."

This study aimed to identify risk factors associated with AA perforation, including the effect of system time (ST) delay, after controlling for patient time (PT) delay. In this study, PT was controlled (to less than or equal to 24 h) to better understand the effect of ST delay on AA perforation. Medical records of patients who underwent surgery for AA at a tertiary referral hospital from October 2009 through September 2013 were reviewed. Data collected included demographics, body mass index, presence of fecalith, PT (i.e., duration of time from symptom onset to arrival in emergency department), and ST (i.e., duration of time from arrival in emergency department to operating room). AA was classified as simple (acute, nonperforated) versus advanced (gangrenous, perforated). Seven hundred forty-seven patients underwent surgery for AA. After excluding patients with PT > 24 h, 445 patients fit the study criteria, of which 358 patients with simple AA and 87 patients with advanced disease. Advanced appendicitis patients were older and had higher body mass index, longer PT, higher WBC, and higher incidence of fecaliths. Both groups had similar ST. Risk factors for advanced appendicitis after multiple regression analysis are age >50 y old, WBC >15,000, the presence of fecaliths, and PT delay >12 h. Once PT delay was limited to ≤24 h, the ST delay of >12 h did not adversely affect the incidence of advanced AA. Age >50 y, WBC >15,000, PT delay >12 h, and the presence of fecaliths were identified as risk factors associated with advanced AA."

Although heterogenous, the most common disease states that comprise EGS often have published guidelines containing recommendations for their diagnosis and management. Not all diseases included within EGS however have published guidelines and existing guidelines may have important gaps in their recommendations. We present a thorough assessment of the existing guidelines for the most common EGS diseases and highlight gaps that will require additional literature review or new research to fill. Literature searches for existing comprehensive guidelines were performed. These guidelines were summarized based on level of supporting evidence and further subcategorized based on American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) grade of disease. Using these summaries, gaps in the exiting recommendations were then generated and refined through review by at least two authors. The initial gap analysis focused on diverticulitis, acute pancreatitis, small bowel obstruction and acute cholecystitis. Despite extensive research into each of these disease processes, critical questions regarding diagnosis and management remain to be answered. Gaps were the result of either low quality research or a complete lack of research. The use of the AAST grade of disease established a framework for evaluating these guidelines and grouping the recommendations. Despite extensive prior research, EGS diseases have multiple areas where additional research would likely result in improved patient care. Consensus on the most important areas for additional research can be obtained through analysis of gaps in existing guidelines. This gap analysis has the potential to inform efforts around developing a research agenda for EGS."

Using the 2007 to 2015 ACS-NSQIP database, we included all patients older than 90 years of age who underwent an emergent operation with a Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code for \"digestive system.\" Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of 30-day mortality. NONAs' mortality rates for different combinations of risk factors were also studied and compared to the ACS-NSQIP calculator-predicted mortality rates. Out of a total of 4,456,809 patients, 4,724 NONAs were included. The overall 30-day patient mortality and morbidity rates were 21% and 45%, respectively. In multivariable analyses, several independent predictors of 30-day mortality were identified, including recent history of weight loss, history of steroid use, smoking, functional dependence, hypoalbuminemia and sepsis or septic shock. The mortality among NONAs with a history of steroid use and a recent history of weight loss was 100%. Similarly, the mortality of NONAs with recent history of weight loss who presented with preoperative septic shock was 93%. The ACS-NSQIP calculator significantly and consistently underestimated the risk of mortality in all NONAs undergoing EGS. Most NONAs undergoing EGS survive the hospital stay and the first 30 postoperative days, even in the presence of significant preexisting comorbidities. However, the combination of recent weight loss with either steroid use or septic shock nearly ensures mortality and should be used in the discussions with patients and families before a decision to operate is made. The ACS-NSQIP surgical risk calculator should be used with caution in these high-risk patients. Prognostic study, level III."

All inpatients that underwent 1 of 7 EGS procedures shown to represent 80% of EGS volume, complications, and mortality nationally were included. Admission source was classified as directly admitted vs transferred from an outside emergency department or an acute care facility. The primary outcomes were overall mortality, overall morbidity, and major morbidity. A 3:1 propensity score matched analysis was used to determine the association of admission source with outcomes. Subgroup analysis was performed for high- and low-risk EGS procedures. A total of 222,519 EGS admissions were identified, of which 15,232 (6.8%) were transfers. Mean age was 46 years and 51.4% were female. Overall mortality was 3.1% for the entire cohort and 10.8% within the transfer group. After propensity score matched analysis for 33 clinical and demographic variables, transferred patients had higher rates of overall mortality (odds ratio 1.01; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.02), higher overall morbidity (odds ratio 1.07; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.09), and major morbidity (odds ratio 1.06; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.08) compared with directly admitted patients. After rigorous risk adjustment, interhospital transfer status has a small effect on mortality and morbidity in the EGS population. This could suggest that it is reasonable to transfer patients and that regionalization of care should be encouraged."

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms that lead to health-care disparities is necessary to create robust solutions that ensure all patients receive the best possible care. Our objective was to quantify the influence of the individual surgeon on disparate outcomes for minority patients undergoing an emergency general surgery (EGS). Using the Florida State Inpatient Database, we analyzed patients who underwent one or more of seven EGS procedures from 2010 to 2014. The primary outcome was development of a major postoperative complication. To determine the individual surgeon effect on complications, we performed multilevel mixed effects modeling, adjusting for clinical and hospital factors, such as diagnosis, comorbidities, and hospital teaching status and volume. 215,745 cases performed by 5816 surgeons at 198 hospitals were included. The overall unadjusted complication rate was 8.6%. Black patients had a higher adjusted risk of having a complication than white patients (odds ratio 1.12, 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.22). Surgeon random effects, when hospital fixed effects were held constant, accounted for 27.2% of the unexplained variation in complication risk among surgeons. This effect was modified by patient race; for white patients, surgeon random effects explained only 12.4% of the variability, compared to 52.5% of the variability in complications among black patients. This multiinstitution analysis within a single large state demonstrates that not only do black patients have a higher risk of developing a complication after undergoing EGS than white patients but also surgeon-level effects account for a larger proportion of the between-surgeon variation. This suggests that the individual surgeon contributes to racial disparities in EGS."

A 3-y (2012-15) review of all EGS patients aged ≥45 y was presented to our institution. Patients who underwent computer tomography-abdomen were included. Sarcopenia was defined as the lowest sex-specific quartile of total psoas index (computer tomography-measured psoas area normalized for body surface area). Patients were divided into sarcopenic (SA) and nonsarcopenic. Primary outcome measures were in-hospital complications, hospital-length of stay [h-LOS], intensive care unit-length of stay, adverse discharge disposition, and in-hospital mortality. Our secondary outcome measures were 30-d complications, readmissions, and mortality. Four hundred fifty-two patients undergoing EGS were included. Mean age was 58 ± 8.7 y, and 60% were males. Hundred thirteen patients were categorized as SA. Compared to nonsarcopenic, SA patients had higher rates of minor complications (28% versus 17%, P = 0.01), longer hospital-length of stay (7d versus 5d, P = 0.02), and were more likely to be discharged to skilled nursing facility/Rehab (35% versus 17%, P = 0.01). There was no difference between the two groups regarding major complications, intensive care unit-length of stay, mortality, and 30-d outcomes. On regression analysis, sarcopenia was an independent predictor of minor complications (OR 1.8 [1.6-3.7]) and discharge to rehab/SNIF (OR: 1.9 [1.5-3.2]). However, there was no association with major complications, mortality, 30-d complications, readmissions, and mortality. Sarcopenia is an independent predictor of minor postoperative complications, prolonged hospital-length of stay, and an adverse discharge disposition in patients undergoing EGS. Identifying SA EGS patients will improve both resource allocation and discussion about the patient's prognosis between physicians, patients, and their families."

    "abstract": "After publication of the Study to Optimize Peritoneal Infection Therapy (STOP IT) trial, we sought to determine if we were implementing study findings into practice appropriately. We had three objectives: evaluate antibiotic usage; evaluate patient outcomes; and delineate differences in antibiotic usage between general surgeons (GS) and trauma/acute care surgery trained surgeons (TACS). This was an analysis of patients with complicated intra-abdominal infection admitted via the emergency department from February 2014 through May 2017. Complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) was defined as perforated viscus, complicated appendicitis, or ischemic bowel. Patients were excluded if they had an ICD-9/10 code for diverticular/anorectal disease, did not undergo source control, or if the post-operative antibiotic course was not given or was incomplete because of withdrawal of care, change in code status, or death. Outcomes and antibiotic usage were compared before and after the STOP IT publication date. Short-course antibiotic regimens were defined as four days or less of antibiotics after source control. A total of 133 patients met inclusion criteria, with 47 admitted before STOP IT and 86 admitted after. Demographics and other characteristics were similar between these groups. Total antibiotic days and antibiotic days after source control decreased after STOP IT publication (p = 0.031 and p = 0.047, respectively). There were no differences in hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit (ICU) LOS, surgical site infections, intra-abdominal abscesses, or death between the two groups. Short-course antibiotic compliance increased after publication from 30% to 52% (p = 0.012). Compared with GS, patients managed by TACS had decreased total antibiotic days (p = 0.030) and antibiotic days after source control (p = 0.025). We demonstrated decreased antibiotic days and increased use of short-course antibiotic regimens for patients with cIAI after the publication of STOP IT. However, there still appears to be opportunity for improved adherence to short-course regimens, as well as opportunities to educate our colleagues."

    "title": "Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease and Acute Surgical Abdomen: Opportunities for Palliative Care.",
    "abstract": "Background: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a life-limiting condition that is often complicated by acute abdominal emergency. Palliative care (PC) has been shown to improve the quality of life in patients with serious illness and yet is underutilized. We hypothesize that ESRD patients with abdominal emergency have high unmet PC needs. Objective: To characterize the outcomes of ESRD patients with acute surgical abdomen, define PC utilization patterns, and identify areas of unmet PC needs. Design: Retrospective study querying the National Inpatient Sample database (2009-2013). Setting and Subjects: Subjects were identified using ICD-9 codes for those aged ≥50 with preexisting diagnosis of ESRD with an acute abdominal emergency diagnosis of gastrointestinal perforation, obstruction, or ischemia. Measurements: Outcomes included PC rate, in-hospital mortality, discharge disposition, and intensity of care. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of PC. Results: A total of 9363 patients met the inclusion criteria; 24% underwent surgery, 16% died in hospital, and 43% were discharged to dependent living. Among in-hospital deaths, 23% received PC. Only 4% of survivors with dependent discharge received PC. Surgical mortality was 26%. PC was less utilized in surgical patients than nonsurgical patients. PC was associated with shorter hospital stay. Predictors of PC included increasing age, severity of underlying illness, white race, teaching hospitals, and the Western region. Conclusions: Patients with ESRD admitted for acute abdominal emergency have high risk for mortality and functional dependence. Despite this, few receive PC and have a high utilization of nonbeneficial life support at the end of life."

    "abstract": "The Acute Care Surgical Unit at Groote Schuur Hospital was established in 2010 and is the first of its kind in Africa. The aim of this study was to describe the outcomes of emergency surgical cases, as well as determine the logistical factors associated with adverse outcomes following surgery within the unit. This study was a retrospective audit which reviewed the folders of adult patients who underwent an emergency surgical procedure from July 2016 to July 2017. The primary outcome was a major adverse event (AE) which was defined by a Clavien-Dindo score of 3-5. A number of logistical factors related to patient admission and operation were evaluated for association with outcomes. A total of 271 patients were included with a mean age of 47 years, with 48% females and 52% males. A major AE was recorded for 13% of patients. The following factors were found to be predictive of a major AE: referral from outside the hospital, urgent booking colour code, reoperation, and consultant most senior surgeon present during procedure. Patient admission/surgery performed outside of normal working hours, being booked for surgery on admission, as well as delay to surgery beyond colour code were not associated with a major AE. Apart from the traditional clinical parameters, factors related to perioperative logistics may contribute to the risk of a major AE after emergency surgery and should be considered for inclusion in more comprehensive predictive models for adverse outcomes within an acute care surgery unit."

    "abstract": "Limited data exist for long-term outcomes after emergency general surgeries (EGSs) in the United States. This study aimed to characterize the incidence of inpatient readmissions and additional operations within 6 months of an EGS procedure. In this retrospective observational study, we identified adults (≥18 years old) undergoing one of seven common EGS procedures (appendectomies, cholecystectomies, small bowel resections, large bowel resections, control of gastrointestinal [GI] ulcers and bleeding, peritoneal adhesiolysis, and exploratory laparotomies) who were discharged alive in the 2010-2015 National Readmissions Database. Outcomes included the rates of all-cause inpatient readmissions and of undergoing a second EGS procedure, both within 6 months. Multivariable logistic regression models identified risk factors of reoperation, adjusting for patient, clinical, and hospital factors. Of 706,678 patients undergoing an EGS procedure 131,291 (18.6%) had an inpatient readmission within 6 months. Among those readmitted, 15,178 (11.6%) underwent a second EGS procedure, occurring at a median of 45 days (interquartile range, 15-95). After adjustment, notable predictors of reoperation included male sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.06 [95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.10]); private, nonprofit hospitals (aOR, 1.09 [1.02-1.17]); private, investor-owned hospitals (aOR, 1.09 [1.00-1.85]); discharge to short-term hospital (aOR, 1.35 [1.04-1.74]); discharge with home health care (aOR, 1.19 [1.13-1.25]); and index procedure of control of GI ulcer and bleeding (aOR, 9.38 [8.75-10.05]), laparotomy (aOR, 7.62 [6.92-8.40]), or large bowel resection (aOR, 6.94 [6.44-7.47]). One fifth of patients undergoing an EGS procedure had an inpatient readmission within 6 months, where one in nine of those underwent a second EGS procedure. As half of all second EGS procedures occurred within 6 weeks of the index procedure, identifying patients with the highest health care needs (index procedure type and discharge needs) may identify patients at risk for subsequent reoperation in nonemergency settings.

    "abstract": "Over the last 5 years, the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma has developed grading scales for emergency general surgery (EGS) diseases. In a previous validation study using diverticulitis, the grading scales were predictive of complications and length of stay. As EGS encompasses diverse diseases, the purpose of this study was to validate the grading scale concept against a different disease process with a higher associated mortality. We hypothesized that the grading scale would be predictive of complications, length of stay, and mortality in skin and soft-tissue infections (STIs). This multi-institutional trial encompassed 12 centers. Data collected included demographic variables, disease characteristics, and outcomes such as mortality, overall complications, and hospital and ICU length of stay. The EGS scale for STI was used to grade each infection and two surgeons graded each case to evaluate inter-rater reliability. 1170 patients were included in this study. Inter-rater reliability was moderate (kappa coefficient 0.472-0.642, with 64-76% agreement). Higher grades (IV and V) corresponded to significantly higher Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis scores when compared with lower EGS grades. Patients with grade IV and V STI had significantly increased odds of all complications, as well as ICU and overall length of stay. These associations remained significant in logistic regression controlling for age, gender, comorbidities, mental status, and hospital-level volume. Grade V disease was significantly associated with mortality as well. This validation effort demonstrates that grade IV and V STI are significantly predictive of complications, hospital length of stay, and mortality. Though predictive ability does not improve linearly with STI grade, this is consistent with the clinical disease process in which lower grades represent cellulitis and abscess and higher grades are invasive infections. This second validation study confirms the EGS grading scale as predictive, and easily used, in disparate disease processes. Prognostic/Epidemiologic retrospective multicenter trial, level III."

Completion the Level Three treatment on time, which was depended on the leading role played by the regional trauma centers was the main rescuing mode of the work in Xixia county, where the primary and secondary treatments were the key parts. The three-level treatment model includes: the local hospital acts as a level-one emergency medical institution, county hospitals function as secondary emergency medical institutions, and other higher medical institutions are the tertiary first aid medical institutions. The pre-hospital and in-hospital emergency procedures were initiated immediately after the large-scale explosive burn being identified, the key to the successfully rescue was to set up a comprehensive treatment team for burns and trauma. Rescue team should involve burn department and other related departments, including the departments of emergency, general surgery, orthopedic, thoracic surgery, neurosurgery, plastic surgery, intensive care unit, blood transfusion unit, anesthesiology, and interventional radiology, etc. All the thirteen burned patients were male, with inhalation injury, blast injury, hemopneumothorax, brain injury, bone fractures, and etc. Eight of them (61.54%) had multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). MODS mainly involved respiratory, circulatory, liver, gastrointestinal tract, kidney and coagulation function. With the multi-discipline treatment, the wound of 6 severely-burned patients started healing and can be discharged after keeping the patency of airway, applying resuscitation fluid and comprehensive treatments such as debridement and dressing change. Among 7 patients with extensive deep burns, one case with skull-based fracture, open craniocerebral, extensive intracranial hemorrhage and hemopneumothorax, died 9 hours later. Another case died within 24 hours after injury due to obvious exudation on the site of early incision and relaxation of wound. The escharotomy, micro-dermis and allograft skin transplantation were carried out for five cases with extensive deep burns from the 4th day after the recovery of shock. One week later, the second stage of microsphere skin transplantation was performed. But all died of sepsis or fungal infection. (1) A total of 113 elderly patients with sepsis were enrolled in the final analysis, including 67 patients in sepsis group and 46 patients in septic shock group. Thirty-two patients were enrolled as healthy controls and 31 elderly patients with CAP as elderly pneumonia group. The PCT, CRP, Lac, APACHE II and SOFA scores of the patients in the three groups were higher than those of the healthy control group, and they were gradually increased with the severity of infection. There was no significant difference in gender or age among the groups. Compared with the healthy control group, the other three groups had higher LL-37 level after admission, the LL-37 levels in the sepsis group and the septic shock group were decreased with the prolongation of the hospitalization time, and they were lower than the pneumonia group at 7 days after admission [LL-37 (μg/L): 1 403.9±501.9, 1 517.1±676.4 vs. 1 608.4±816.2, both P > 0.05]. It was shown by correlation analysis that the LL-37 level in peripheral blood of elderly patients with sepsis was significantly negatively correlated with APACHE II score (r = -0.329, P = 0.007) and SOFA score (r = -0.344, P = 0.005), but no significant correlation with Lac was found (r = -0.128, P = 0.311). (2) The 28-day survival analysis revealed that of the 113 elderly patients with sepsis, 54 (47.8%) survived at 28 days and 59 (52.2%) died. There was no significant difference in gender, age, PCT or CRP levels at 1 day after admission between the two groups. The 1-day Lac, APACHE II and SOFA scores of the patients in the non-survival group were significantly higher than those in the survival group, they were gradually increased with the prolongation of the hospitalization time, and they were significantly higher than those in the survival group at 7 days after admission [Lac (mmol/L): 2.4 (1.4, 4.4) vs. 1.0 (0.8, 1.7), APACHE II score: 21.77±5.85 vs. 13.74±4.99, SOFA score: 9.62±4.78 vs. 3.18±2.71, all P < 0.01]. With the prolongation of admission, there was no significant change in LL-37 level of peripheral blood in the survival group. The LL-37 level in the non-survival group showed a downward tendency, and it was significantly lower than that in the survival group at 7 days after admission (μg/L: 1 277.8±642.6 vs. 1 620.6±461.6, P < 0.05). It was shown by ROC curve analysis that the LL-37 in peripheral blood, Lac, APACHE II score and SOFA score at 7-day of admission of elderly patients with sepsis had predictive value for prognosis, and LL-37 had the best predicted effect for 28-day death, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of LL-37 was 0.670, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 0.513-0.757, when the optimal cut-off value was 1 283.0 μg/L, the sensitivity was 75.7%, and the specificity was 61.5%. MODS and infection often occur during the course especially for patients with extensive and deep burns due to the great explosion in Xixia county, most of whom were accompanied with MODS and infection. Therefore, assembling multi-discipline team for treating the group of explosively-burned patients can increase the survival rate and reduce the possibility of disability."

    "abstract": "Acute care surgery (ACS) comprises trauma, surgical critical care, and emergency general surgery (EGS), encompassing both operative and nonoperative conditions. While the burden of EGS and trauma has been separately considered, the global footprint of ACS has not been fully characterized. We sought to characterize the costs and scope of influence of ACS-related conditions. We hypothesized that ACS patients comprise a substantial portion of the US inpatient population. We further hypothesized that ACS patients differ from other surgical and non-surgical patients across patient characteristics. We queried the National Inpatient Sample 2014, a nationally representative database for inpatient hospitalizations. To capture all adult ACS patients, we included adult admissions with any International Classification of Diseases-9th Rev.-Clinical Modification diagnosis of trauma or an International Classification of Diseases-9th Rev.-Clinical Modification diagnosis for one of the 16 AAST-defined EGS conditions. Weighted patient data were presented to provide national estimates. Of the 29.2 million adult patients admitted to US hospitals, approximately 5.9 million (20%) patients had an ACS diagnosis. ACS patients accounted for US $85.8 billion, or 25% of total US inpatient costs (US $341 billion). When comparing ACS to non-ACS inpatient populations, ACS patients had higher rates of health care utilization with longer lengths of stay (5.9 days vs. 4.5 days, p < 0.001), and higher mean costs (US $14,466 vs. US $10,951, p < 0.001. Of all inpatients undergoing an operative procedure, 27% were patients with an ACS diagnosis. Overall, 3,186 (70%) of US hospitals cared for both trauma and EGS patients. Acute care surgery patients comprise 20% of the inpatient population, but 25% of total inpatient costs in the United States. In addition to being costly, they overall have higher health care utilization and worse outcomes. This suggests that there is an opportunity to improve clinical trajectory for ACS patients that in turn, can affect the overall US health care costs. Epidemiologic, level III."

    "abstract": "We hypothesized that the universal adoption of closed wounds with negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in emergency general surgery patients would result in low superficial surgical infection (SSI) rates. We performed a retrospective observational study using primary wound closure with external NPWT, from May 2017 to May 2018. Patients with active soft tissue infection of the abdominal wall were excluded. Data were analyzed by Fisher's exact tests and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests, with significance is set at a value of p < 0.05. Eighty-five patients (53% female) with a median age of 65 years (range 19 to 98 years) underwent laparotomies. Four patients were excluded for active soft tissue infection. Wounds were classified as dirty (n = 18), contaminated (n = 52), and clean contaminated (n = 11). Median BMI was 27 kg/m2 (interquartile range [IQR] 23.4 to 33.0 kg/m2). Median antibiotic therapy was 4 days (IQR 1 to 7 days). Twenty-six patients had open abdomen management. Patient follow-up was a median of 20 days (range 14 to 120 days). Six patients (7%) developed superficial SSI requiring conversion to open wound management. No patients developed fascial dehiscence. There were no statistically significant associations between SSI and wound class (p = 0.072), antibiotic duration (p = 0.702), open abdomen management, or preoperative risk factors (p < 0.1). Overall morbidity was 38% and mortality was 6%. Primary closure of high risk incisions combined with NPWT is associated with acceptably low SSI rates. Due to the low morbidity and decreased cost associated with this technique, primary closure with NPWT should replace open wound management in the emergency general surgery population."

    "abstract": "Outcomes following damage control laparotomy for trauma have been studied in detail. However, outcomes following a single operation, or \"single-look trauma laparotomy\" (SLTL), have not. We evaluated the association between SLTL and both short-term and long-term outcomes in a large population-based data set. The California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development patient discharge database was evaluated for calendar years 2007 through 2014. Injured patients with SLTL during their index admission were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification procedure codes. Diagnosis and procedure codes were used to identify specific abdominal organ injuries, surgical interventions, and perioperative complications. Subsequent acute care admissions were examined for postoperative complications and related surgical interventions. Clinical characteristics, injuries, surgical interventions, and outcomes were analyzed by mechanism of injury. There were 2113 patients with SLTL during their index admission; 712 (33.7%) had at least one readmission to an acute care facility. Median time to first readmission was 110 days. Penetrating mechanism was more common than blunt (60.6% vs. 39.4%). Compared to patients with penetrating injury, blunt-injured patients had a significantly higher median Injury Severity Score (9 vs. 18, p < 0.0001) and a significantly higher mortality rate during the index admission (4.1% vs. 27.0%, p < 0.0001). More than 30% of SLTL patients requiring readmission had a surgery-related complication. The most common primary reasons for readmission were bowel obstruction (17.7%), incisional hernia (11.8%), and infection (9.1%). There was no significant association between mechanism of injury and development of surgery-related complications requiring readmission. Patients with SLTL had postinjury morbidity and mortality, and more than 30% required readmission. Complication rates for SLTL were comparable to those reported for emergency general surgery procedures. Patients should be educated on signs and symptoms of the most common complications before discharge following SLTL. Further investigation should focus on the factors associated with the development of these complications. Prognostic and epidemiologic study, level III."

We hypothesized that primary fascial closure rates would increase following protocol implementation with no difference in complication rates. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of 138 adult trauma and emergency general surgery patients who underwent emergent laparotomy and TAC, comparing protocol patients (n = 60) to recent historic controls (n = 78) who would have met protocol inclusion criteria. The protocol includes low-volume 3% hypertonic saline resuscitation, judicious wound vacuum fluid replacement, and early relaparotomy with sequential fascial closure. Demographics, baseline characteristics, illness severity, resuscitation course, operative management, and outcomes were compared. The primary outcome was fascial closure. Baseline characteristics, including age, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, and postoperative lactate levels, were similar between groups. Within 48 hours of initial laparotomy and TAC, protocol patients received significantly lower total intravenous fluid resuscitation volumes (9.7 vs. 11.4 L, p = 0.044) and exhibited higher serum osmolarity (303 vs. 293 mOsm/kg, p = 0.001). The interval between abdominal operations was significantly shorter following protocol implementation (28.2 vs. 32.2 hours, p = 0.027). The incidence of primary fascial closure was significantly higher in the protocol group (93% vs. 81%, p = 0.045, number needed to treat = 8.3). Complication rates were similar between groups. Protocol implementation was associated with lower crystalloid resuscitation volumes, a transient hyperosmolar state, shorter intervals between operations, and higher fascial closure rates with no difference in complications.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Records of patients who underwent laparoscopic or open appendectomy, cholecystectomy, or colon resection after emergency admission from 2004 to 2011 were obtained. Outcomes analyzed included in-hospital mortality, length of stay, total charges, and selected postoperative complications. Patients were divided among three groups, HIV-negative controls, asymptomatic HIV-positive patients, and symptomatic HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. Data were analyzed using χ and multivariable regression with propensity score matching among the three groups, with p value less than 0.05 significant. There were 974,588 patients identified, of which 1,489 were HIV-positive and 1,633 were HIV/AIDS-positive. The HIV/AIDS patients were more likely to die during their hospital stay than HIV-negative patients (4.4% vs. 1.6%, adjusted odds ratio, 3.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.67-4.07; p < 0.001). The HIV/AIDS patients had longer hospital stays (7 days vs. 3 days; adjusted difference, 3.66 days; 95% CI, 3.53-4.00; p < 0.001) and higher median total charges than HIV-negative patients (US $47,714 vs. US $28,405; adjusted difference, US $15,264; 95% CI, US $13,905-US $16,623; p < 0.001).

Differences persisted irrespective of case complexity and over the study period. Asymptomatic HIV-positive patients had outcomes similar to HIV-negative patients. The HIV/AIDS patients have a greater risk of death, infectious, and noninfectious complications after emergency surgery regardless of operative complexity and despite advanced highly active antiretroviral therapy. Patients who have not developed advanced disease, however, have similar outcomes to HIV-negative patients. Prognostic and epidemiologic study, level III."

We sought to characterize the clinical and cost burden of such transfers to our tertiary referral center. Data were collected retrospectively for nine EGS diagnoses for patients admitted to the EGS service during calendar years 2015 and 2016. Patients were grouped as inpatient transfers (IPTs), Emergency Department transfers (EDTs), or local admissions (LAs). Demographic data, length of stay at originating site, insurance status, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and all relevant financial data were obtained. Six hundred sixty-three patients were reviewed: 93 IPTs, 343 EDTs, and 227 LAs. IPTs required longer lengths of stay (7.0 d compared to 4.0 d for EDTs and 3.0 d for LAs), higher median direct costs, and higher case mix index, which produced a higher median revenue but averaged a median net loss (-$264 compared to +$2436 for EDTs and +$3125 for LAs). The IPTs had higher median comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index 3.5 versus 2.9 for EDTs and 2.0 for LAs), age (62 y versus 58 for EDTs and 52 for LAs), and mortality rate (7.5% versus 2.3% for EDTs and 0.4% for LAs). Patients who present to a tertiary care EGS service as an IPT from another hospital have more comorbidities, higher mortality rate, and result in a financial loss. These data suggest the need for adequate risk adjustment in quality assessment of tertiary referral center outcomes and the need for increased financial reimbursement for the care of these patients."

Seven procedure types dominate: colon, small bowel, gallbladder, ulcer disease, adhesiolysis, appendix, and laparotomy operations. A higher comorbidity burden is known to increase mortality in this population, but the impact of specific comorbidity combinations is unknown. Our objectives were to (1) characterize the distribution of procedures, comorbidities, and outcomes for older patients undergoing EGS; and (2) apply a data-driven approach (association rule mining) to identify comorbidity combinations associated with disproportionately high mortality. Cross-sectional study of patients 65 years and older who underwent one of the seven procedures previously cited, taken from the 2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample. A total of 280 885 patient encounters were identified. In-hospital mortality, procedures, and comorbidities based on the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index. Overall mortality was 5.6%. The most common procedures were gallbladder (33.7%), ulcer surgery (21.5%), and adhesiolysis (21.0%). Mortality increased for all procedures as patients aged. Comorbidities associated with the highest mortality included coagulopathy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.41-4.11; p < .001), fluid and electrolyte disorders (FED) (aOR = 2.89; 95% CI = 3.66-3.14; p < .001), and liver disease (aOR = 1.89; 95% CI = 1.61-2.22; p < .001). Three-way comorbidity combinations most highly associated with mortality were coagulopathy, FED, and peripheral vascular disease (aOR = 5.10; 95% CI = 4.17-6.24; p < .001), and coagulopathy, FED, and chronic pulmonary disease (aOR = 4.83; 95% CI = 4.00-5.82; p < .001). For older patients, combinations of comorbidities portend additional risk beyond single comorbidities, and the associated risk burden is driven by the specific constellation of comorbidities present. Future work must continue to examine the effect of co-occurring diseases to provide personalized and realistic prognostication for older patients undergoing EGS. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:503-510, 2019."

Increasing specialization and a decreasing general surgery workforce have led to concerns about access to care, which may lead to increased transfers. We sought to evaluate the reasons for and timing of transfers for EGS diagnoses. We performed a retrospective medical record review of patients transferred to a tertiary academic medical center between January 4, 2014 and March 31, 2016 who had an EGS diagnosis (bowel obstruction, appendicitis, cholecystitis/cholangitis/choledocholithiasis, diverticulitis, mesenteric ischemia, perforated viscus, or postoperative surgical complication). Three hundred thirty-four patients were transferred from 70 hospitals. Transfer reasons varied with the majority due to the need for specialized services (44.3%) or a surgeon (26.6%). Imaging was performed in 95.8% and 35.3% had surgeon contact before transfer. The percentage of patients who underwent procedures at referring facilities was 7.5% (n = 25), while 60.6% (n = 83) underwent procedures following transfer. Mean time between transfer request and arrival at the accepting hospital was lower for patients who subsequently underwent a procedure at the accepting hospital compared to those who did not for patients originating in emergency departments (2.6 versus 3.4 h, P < 0.05) and inpatient units (6.9 versus 14.3 h, P < 0.05). Interhospital transfers for EGS conditions are frequently motivated by a need for a higher level of care or specialized services as well as a need for a general surgeon. Understanding reasons for transfers can inform decisions regarding the allocation and provision of care for this vulnerable population."

    "title": "Failure to Rescue After Emergency General Surgery in Geriatric Patients: Does Frailty Matter?",
    "abstract": "Failure to rescue (FTR) is considered as an index of quality of care provided by a hospital. However, the role of frailty in FTR remains unclear. We hypothesized that the FTR rate is higher for frail geriatric emergency general surgery (EGS) patients than nonfrail geriatric EGS patients. We performed a 3-y (2015-2017) prospective cohort study of all geriatric patients (age ≥ 65 y) requiring EGS. Frailty was calculated by using the EGS-specific Frailty Index (EGSFI) within 24 h of admission. Patients were divided into two groups: frail (FI ≥ 0.325) and nonfrail (FI < 0.325). We defined FTR as death from a major complication. Regression analysis was performed to control for demographics, type of operative intervention, admission vitals, and admission laboratory values. Three hundred twenty-six geriatric EGS patients were included, of which 38.9% were frail. Frail patients were more likely to be white (P < 0.01) and, on admission, had a higher American Association of Anesthesiologist class (P = 0.03) and lower serum albumin (P < 0.01). However, there was no difference between the groups regarding age (P = 0.54), gender (P = 0.56), admission vitals, and WBC count (P = 0.35). Overall, 26.7% (n = 85) of patients developed in-hospital complications; and mortality occurred in 30% (n = 26) of those patients (i.e., the FTR group). Frail patients had higher rates of FTR (14% vs. 4%, P < 0.001) than nonfrail patients. On regression analysis, after controlling for confounders, frail status was an independent predictor of FTR (OR: 3.4 [2.3-4.6]) in geriatric EGS patients. Our study demonstrates that in geriatric EGS patients, a frail status independently contributes to FTR and increases the odds of FTR threefold compared with nonfrail status. Thus, it should be included in quality metrics for geriatric EGS patients."

    "abstract": "With the population of octogenarians projected to increase fourfold by 2050, we sought to compare outcomes of laparoscopic versus open approach in octogenarians requiring surgery for adhesive small bowel obstruction (SBO). Using 2006-2015 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project, we identified patients aged ≥80 y who underwent emergency surgery within 1 d of admission for SBO. Risk variables of interest included age, sex, race, body mass index, preoperative sepsis, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification. Outcomes included length of stay, mortality, and pneumonia. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed. Eight hundred fifty-six patients were identified. Six hundred ninety-nine (81.7%) underwent laparotomy; 157 (18.3%) underwent laparoscopy. Twenty-four (15.3%) of laparoscopic cases were converted. There was no difference between the open and laparoscopic groups in age, and race, preoperative albumin, or preoperative sepsis. The open group had higher rates of totally dependent functional status, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and higher ASA class. There was no difference in operative time. Laparoscopy was associated with shorter length of stay. The open approach showed higher rates of postoperative pneumonia, myocardial infarct, and mortality. Multivariable analysis showed increased age, functional status, preoperative albumin, and ASA class associated with mortality. The operative approach was not associated with mortality. Postoperative pneumonia was associated with male sex and open approach. Age, preoperative functional status, low preoperative albumin, and ASA classes IV and V were associated with mortality, while the open approach and male sex were associated with postoperative pneumonia. Octogenarians who present with SBO due to adhesive disease may benefit from an initial laparoscopic exploration. Further prospective studies are warranted."

    "abstract": "It is reported that performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) at night leads to increased rates of complications and conversion to open. We hypothesize that it is safe to perform LC at night in appropriately selected patients. We performed a retrospective review of nonelective LC in adults at our institution performed between April 2007 and February 2015. We dichotomized the cases to either day or night. Five thousand two hundred four patients underwent LC, with 4628 during the day and 576 at night. There were no differences in age, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, race, insurance type, pregnancy rate, or white blood cell count. There were also no differences in the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, or renal failure. However, daytime patients had higher median initial total bilirubin (0.6 [0.4, 1.3] versus 0.5 [0.3, 1.0] mg/dL, P = 0.002) and lipase (33 [24, 56] versus 30 [22, 42] U/L, P < 0.001) values. There was no difference in case length, estimated blood loss, rate of conversion to open, biliary complications, length of stay (LOS) after operation, unanticipated return to the hospital in 60 d, or 60-d mortality. Daytime patients spent more time in the hospital with longer median LOS before surgery (1 [1, 2] versus 1 [0, 2] d, P < 0.001) and median total LOS (3 [2, 4] versus 2 [1, 3] d, P < 0.001) compared with night patients. At our institution, we perform LC safely during day or night. The lack of complications and shorter LOS justify performing LC at any hour."

    "abstract": "Our institution has emergency rooms (ERs) with an operating room (OR) setup, which enables surgeons to perform thoracotomy and/or laparotomy for trauma patients without transferring patients to the OR. We hypothesized that the ERs with an OR setup improve the timeliness of surgery for trauma patients. Data were reviewed from trauma patients who underwent emergency surgeries performed by our acute care surgery group from April 2013 to June 2017. Patients' demographics, diagnoses, location of the operation (ER versus regular OR), type of operation, time from admission to operation, and perioperative outcomes including in-hospital mortality were analyzed. These data were compared between patients who underwent surgery in the ER versus the OR. There were 105 trauma patients who met the inclusion criteria. Of these 105 patients, 50 underwent surgery in the ER (47.6%, ER group), whereas 55 underwent surgery in the OR (52.4%, OR group). Compared with the OR group, the ER group had a shorter time from admission to operation (median 43 min [range 3-105 min] versus 109 min [range 15-1340 min], P < 0.04), and higher in-hospital mortality rate (38.2% versus 0%, P < 0.01). An ER with an OR setup can enable surgery to be started sooner. Compared with the OR group, patients who underwent surgery performed in the ER tended to be in a more serious condition, and were thus likely to have a higher mortality rate. Further study is warranted to determine which patients would benefit best from this approach."

We sought to examine the national impact Medicaid expansion has had on insurance coverage for patients undergoing emergency general surgery (EGS) and the cost burden to patients. The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) was used to identify adults ≥18 y old who underwent the 10 most burdensome EGS operations (defined as a combination of frequency, cost, and morbidity). Distribution of insurance type before and after Medicaid expansion and charges to uninsured patients was evaluated. Weighted averages were used to produce nationally representative estimates. A total of 6,847,169 patients were included. The percentage of uninsured EGS patients changed from 9.4% the year before Medicaid expansion to 7.0% after (P < 0.01), whereas the percentage of patients on Medicaid increased from 16.4% to 19.4% (P < 0.01). The cumulative charges to uninsured patients for EGS decreased from $1590 million before expansion to $1211 million after. In the first year of Medicaid expansion, the number of uninsured EGS patients dropped by 2.4%. The cost burden to uninsured EGS patients decreased by over $300 million."

It has represented a milestone. At present, the medical evolutions in trauma management allowed an incredible progress in trauma decision-making and treatment. Non-operative trauma management has been widely applied. The interventional radiological procedures and the modern conception of Hybrid and Endovascular Trauma and Bleeding Management (EVTM) led to good results in increasing the rate of patients managed non-operatively, opening new scenarios and options. Even severe anatomical lesions in hemodynamically stable patients can be safely managed non-operatively. The driving issue in deciding for the best treatment is anatomy, as well as physiology, for the patient physiological derangement grade is even more important. The emergency general surgeon must be prepared in those pathophysiological issues that play the pivotal role in the team management of trauma patients. Moreover, the classification of trauma patients cannot only remain anchored to anatomical lesions. The necessity to follow the modern possibilities of treatment imposes addressing trauma using a classification based on anatomical lesions and on the physiological status of the patient."

    "abstract": "The traditional 24-h call model faces pressure from competing needs between emergency and elective services. Recognizing this, a dedicated ESAT service was developed in Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in Singapore, with improved clinical outcomes. It was initially led by a single consultant (SC) in 2014, and subsequently evolved to a weekly consultant rotation (WC) roster in 2017 to achieve sustainability. Each consultant led the ESAT WC service for a week and maintained ownership of their patients thereafter. All emergency surgical admissions between two distinct 6-month periods were reviewed, from May to October 2014 (pre-ESAT) and January to June 2017 (ESAT WC). Patient demographics, diagnoses, and operations were compared. Efficiency and clinical outcomes were evaluated. There were 1248 and 1284 patients in the pre-ESAT and ESAT WC group, respectively. Majority were males and in their 50s. Acute appendicitis, gallstone conditions, and soft-tissue infections made up half of the admissions. Trauma workload was comparable (7.8% pre-ESAT vs 9.5% ESAT WC). Cholecystectomies doubled during the ESAT period, 14.2% vs 7.2%, (p = 0.01). More consultants were involved in major cases (95.9% vs 86%), (p = 0.01) and more operations were performed during the day (52.1% vs 47.9%), (p = 0.01). Average time to OT was shorter and there were less major surgical complications (p = 0.02). Mortality (p = 0.08) and length of stay were reduced (4 vs 4.5 days), (p = 0.01).

    "abstract": "As the aging American population poses unique challenges to acute care services, we determined if either hospital proportion or annual volume of geriatric patients undergoing emergency general surgery (EGS) procedures is associated with outcomes. Using criteria from the American Association of the Surgery of Trauma, we identified five EGS procedures in the 2012-2015 Nationwide Inpatient Sample common in geriatric patients (65+ years). We defined hospital proportion as the fraction of geriatric EGS patients divided by all EGS patients, where volume was the raw number of geriatric EGS patients. We then divided hospitals into quartiles both by proportion and then by volume of geriatric patients. Multivariable logistic regressions compared four outcomes between these quartiles: mortality, complications, failure to rescue (FTR; death after a complication), and extended length of stay (LOS; procedure-specific top decile of patients). We identified 25,084 complex EGS procedures in geriatric patients at 3,528 hospitals (mortality, 10.6%; complications, 30.5%; FTR, 27.7%; extended LOS, 9.1%). The median hospital proportion of geriatric patients among EGS procedures was 42.8% (interquartile range, 33.3-52.2%), whereas the median hospital geriatric EGS volume after nationwide weighting was 40 per year (interquartile range, 20-70/year). After adjustment, the lowest hospital proportion quartile relative to the highest was associated with adverse outcomes: mortality (odds ratio, 1.21 [95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.44]), complications (1.16 [1.05-1.29]), FTR (1.32 [1.08-1.63]), and extended LOS (1.30 [1.12-1.50]). The lowest volume quartile relative to the highest was not associated with adverse outcomes. As the hospital proportion of geriatric patients increased by 10%, the odds of all adverse outcomes decreased: mortality by 7%, complications by 4%, FTR by 9%, and extended LOS by 8%. When accounting for both, hospital proportion of geriatric EGS patients but not hospital volume is associated with postoperative outcomes, having important implications for quality improvement initiatives, benchmarking endeavors, and health services research.

An electronic survey, designed to capture both quantitative and qualitative data, was piloted and then circulated to members of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland. Two hundred and forty-two responses were received from 848 recipients (a 29% response rate) covering 104 of 135 (77%) acute NHS Trusts in England. EGS surgeons were in post in 43/141 (30%) hospitals overall and 12/24 (50%) of hospitals in London. Most respondents working in units with EGS surgeons found them to be advantageous (46/63, 73%). Consultants working with EGS surgeons were significantly more likely to support their use (49/63, 78%) than those without them (83/178, 47%) (χ2  = 16.9, P < 0.001). EGS surgeons were considered to improve the delivery of EGS (78%), create time for subspecialists (70%) and provide service (73%). However, there were concerns about the quality of surgery (43%), an insufficient standard of specialist care (54%) and compromise in the training of juniors (25%). Respondents commented on a lack of job structure with a high attrition rate (21%), the insufficient quality of applicants (18%) and that subspecialization and split on-call was preferable (17%). Respondents were supportive of the ability of EGS surgeons to relieve pressure on subspecialists; however, there were significant concerns about the sustainability and quality of the EGS surgeon role.

We examine the outcome of implementing a policy to offer laparoscopic cholecystectomy on index presentation to patients with biliary colic in a tertiary hospital in Australia. This is a retrospective cohort study of adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with biliary pain during three 12-month periods. Outcomes in Group A, 3 years prior to policy implementation, were compared with groups 2 and 7 years post implementation (Groups B and C). Primary outcomes were representations to ED, admission rate and time to cholecystectomy. A total of 584 patients presented with biliary colic during the three study periods. Of these, 391 underwent cholecystectomy with three Strasberg Type A bile leaks and no bile duct injuries. The policy increased admission rates (A = 15.8%, B = 62.9%, C = 29.5%, P < 0.001) and surgery on index presentation (A = 12.0%, B = 60.7%, C = 27.4%, P < 0.001).

Using the statewide general surgery Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative (MSQC) data, we previously confirmed that wide variations in EGS outcomes were unrelated to case volume/complexity. We assessed whether patient care model (PCM) affected EGS outcomes. There were 34 hospitals that provided data for PCM, resources, surgeon practice patterns, and comprehensive MSQC patient data from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2016 (general surgery cases = 126,494; EGS cases = 39,023). Risk and reliability adjusted outcomes were determined using hierarchical multivariable logistic regression analysis with multiple clinical covariates and PCM. The general surgery service (GSS) model was more common (73%) than acute care surgery (ACS, 27%). Emergency general surgery 30-day mortality was 4.1% (intestinal resections 11.6%). The ACS model was associated with a reduction of 31% in mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.69; 95% CI 0.52-0.92] for EGS cases, related to decreased mortality in the intestinal resection cohort (8.5% ACS vs 12% GSS, p < 0.0001). Morbidity in EGS was 17.4% (9.7% elective); highest (40%) in intestinal resection, and PCM did not affect morbidity. We identified specific variables for an optimal EGS risk adjustment model. This is the first multi-institutional study to identify that an ACS model is associated with a significant 31% mortality reduction in EGS using prospectively collected, clinically obtained, research-quality collaborative data.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess effectiveness and safety of laparoscopic access versus open sigmoidectomy in acute setting. A systematic literature search was performed for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs published in PubMed, SCOPUS and Web of Science. The search yielded four non-RCTs encompassing 436 patients undergoing either laparoscopic (181 patients, 41.51%) versus open sigmoid resection (255 patients, 58.49%). All studies reported ASA scores, but only four studies reported other severity scoring systems (Mannheim Peritonitis Index, P-POSSUM). Level of surgical expertise was reported in only one study. Laparoscopy improves slightly the rates of overall post-operative complications and post-operative hospital stay, respectively (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.80 and MD -6.53, 95% CI -16.05 to 2.99). Laparoscopy did not seem to improve the other clinical outcomes: rate of Hartmann's vs anastomosis, operating time, reoperation rate and postoperative 30-day mortality. In this review four prospective studies were included, over 20 + year period, including overall 400 + patients. This meta-analysis revealed significant advantages associated with a laparoscopic over open approach to emergency sigmoidectomy in acute diverticulitis in terms of postoperative complication rates, although no differences were found in other outcomes. The lack of hemodynamic data and reasons for operative approach hamper interpretation of the data suggesting that patients undergoing open surgery were sicker and these results must be considered with extreme caution and this hypothesis requires confirmation by future prospective randomised controlled trials."

Few studies evaluating the incidence and risk factors of CDI in this patient population are available. A prospectively maintained Acute and Critical Care Surgery registry spanning from 2008 to 2015 was queried for cases of operative EGS with clinical suspicion of CDI post-operatively. Diagnosis of CDI was made using toxin A/B assay in stools. Demographics, co-morbidities, surgical procedures, length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit LOS, antibiotic use, and death were obtained. The patients positive and negative for CDI were compared using chi-squared and Student's t-test. Multi-variable logistic regression was used to determine risk factors for CDI. A total of 550 patients were identified. The total incidence of CDI was 12.7%. There was no significant difference in demographics between CDI positive and negative patients. Average time to CDI diagnosis was 10.1 ± 8.5 days post-operatively. Patients who received three or more antibiotic classes were at higher risk of CDI developing post-operatively (83% vs. 75%, p = 0.04). The CDI positive patients underwent an EGS significantly earlier than CDI negative patients (0.9 ± 2.3 vs. 3.2 ± 9.2 days, p < 0.001). The most common procedures were partial colectomies (21.4%); small bowel resections/repairs (12.9%); gastric repair for perforated peptic ulcer (10%); skin and soft tissue procedure (7.1%), and laparotomies (5.7%). There was no difference in outcomes between the groups. On linear regression, an EGS performed later after admission was an independent risk factor for lower CDI (OR 0.87; CI 95% [0.79-0.96], p < 0.01). Patients undergoing an early EGS have a high incidence of CDI. The number of antibiotic classes administered post-operatively affects CDI status. Bowel resections appear to be at increased risk for CDI. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion and low threshold for testing C. difficile in high-risk EGS patients."

All individuals aged 70 and older consecutively admitted to the emergency surgery unit with an urgent need for abdominal surgery between December 2015 and May 2016 who met inclusion criteria (N=110). Individuals were screened with the fTRST and additional metrics such as the age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index and American Society of Anesthesiology score. Thirty- and 90-day postoperative complications where recorded. Regression analyses were performed to identify possible preoperative predictors of adverse outcomes. Thirty-day major complications (Clavien-Dindo Classification 3-5) occurred in 28.2% of participants (n=31). fTRST had the highest correlation with major complications (odds ratio (OR) = 7.42). All participants who died within 30 days of surgery has a fTRST score of 2 or greater (area under the receiver operating curve (AUC)=71.3). When risk factors for overall 90-day mortality were analyzed, a fTRST score of 2 or greater had sensitivity of 96% (95% confidence interval CI=79.6-99.9%), specificity of 43.5% (95% CI=32.8-54.7%) (AUC=69.8%; OR=18.50, 95% CI=2.39-143.11, p = .005). The average length of hospital stay was more than twice as long in the group with a fTRST score of 2 or greater (15.2 days) than in those with a score less than 2 (6.6 days) (p = .005). The fTRST is an effective tool to predict mortality, morbidity, and length of stay after emergency surgery and can therefore be used to anticipate postoperative course, determine care goals, and plan for involvement of a dedicated geriatric care team.

The aim of this study was to identify whether disparities in the EGS setting are more likely to be caused by major adverse events (MAEs) (e.g., venous thromboembolism) or failure to respond appropriately to such events. A retrospective cohort study was undertaken using administrative data. EGS cases were defined using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnostic codes recommended by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma. The data source was the National Inpatient Sample 2012-2013, which captured a 20%-stratified sample of discharges from all hospitals participating in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. The outcomes were MAEs, in-hospital mortality, and failure to rescue (FTR). There were 1,345,199 individual patient records available within the National Inpatient Sample. There were 201,574 admissions (15.0%) complicated by an MAE, and 12,006 of these (6.0%) resulted in death. The FTR rate was therefore 6.0%. Uninsured patients had significantly higher odds of MAEs (adjusted odds ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.19), mortality (1.28, 1.16-1.41), and FTR (1.20, 1.06-1.36) than those with private insurance. Although black patients had significantly higher odds of MAEs (adjusted odds ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.16), they had lower mortality (0.95, 0.90-0.99) and FTR (0.86, 0.80-0.91) than white patients. Uninsured EGS patients are at increased risk of MAEs but also the failure of health care providers to respond effectively when such events occur. This suggests that MAEs and FTR are both potential targets for mitigating socioeconomic disparities in the setting of EGS."

    "title": "Emergency Surgery Score Accurately Predicts the Risk of Post-Operative Infection in Emergency General Surgery.",
    "abstract": "The Emergency Surgery Score (ESS) was validated recently as an accurate and user-friendly post-operative mortality risk calculator specific for Emergency General Surgery (EGS). ESS is calculated by adding one to three integer points for each of 22 pre-operative variables (demographics, co-morbidities, and pre-operative laboratory values); increasing scores accurately and gradually predict higher mortality rates. We sought to evaluate whether ESS can predict the occurrence of post-operative infectious complications in EGS patients. Using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database from 2007-2015, all EGS patients were identified by using the \"emergent\" ACS-NSQIP variable and a concomitant surgery Current Procedural Terminology code for \"digestive system.\" Patients with any missing ESS variables or those who died within 72 hours from the surgical procedure were excluded. A composite variable, post-operative infection, was created and defined as the post-operative occurrence of one or more of the following: superficial, deep incisional or organ/space surgical site infection, surgical site disruption, pneumonia, sepsis, septic shock, or urinary tract infection. ESS was calculated for all included patients, and the correlation between ESS and post-operative infection was examined using c-statistics. Of a total of 4,456,809 patients, 90,412 patients were included. The mean age of the population was 56 years, 51% were female, and 70% were white; 22% developed one or more post-operative infections, most commonly sepsis/septic shock (12.2%), surgical site infection (9%), and pneumonia (5.7%). The ESS gradually and consistently predicted infectious complications; post-operative infections developed in 7%, 24%, and 49% of patients with an ESS of 1, 5, and 10, respectively. The c-statistics for overall post-operative infection, post-operative sepsis/septic shock, and pneumonia were 0.73, 0.75, and 0.80, respectively. The ESS accurately predicts the occurrence of post-operative infectious complications in EGS patients and could be used for pre-operative clinical decision-making as well as quality benchmarking of infection rates in EGS."

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the frequency and cause of preventable and potentially preventable complications on an emergency nontrauma surgical service. The study is a retrospective review conducted at an academic teaching hospital. All patients were assessed (January 2010-June 2012) for emergency general surgical conditions, excluding trauma. The main outcome measures were preventable and potentially preventable complications and deaths, treatments, loop closure mechanisms, and impact on outcomes. The results showed that of 9078 nontrauma emergency surgical admissions and consultations, 194 patients (2.1%) had 261 complications. One hundred and ten (42.1% of total complications) were preventable. The most common causes of preventable complications were delay in management or diagnosis (n = 45, 41% of all preventable complications), technical/iatrogenic (n = 28, 25%), and infectious (n = 18, 16%). The most common nonpreventable complication was infectious (n = 84, 82% of all complications). The most common diagnoses associated with preventable complications were acute cholecystitis (n = 27, 25%), acute appendicitis (n = 25, 23%), and small bowel obstruction (n = 7, 6%). Preventable complications changed management in 80 per cent of cases. Of three (0.01%) mortalities, two were preventable. The mortality rate in emergency nontrauma surgery is low. A significant burden of complications remains. A large proportion are preventable or potentially preventable, with many changing management. These preventable errors are important targets for quality improvement efforts as the specialty of acute care surgery evolves."

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate secular trends in the epidemiology of emergency general surgery (EGS), by analyzing changes in demographics, diagnoses, operations, and outcomes between 1997 and 2016. The provision and delivery of EGS services is a globally and regionally important issue. The impact of changing demographics and surgical disease incidence on EGS services is not well understood. Data from all EGS hospital episodes of adults (aged >15) in Scotland between 1997 and 2016 were prospectively collected, including ICD-10 diagnostic codes and OPCS-4 procedure codes. The number and age- and sex-standardized rates per 100,000 population, per year, of the most common diagnoses and operations were calculated. We analyzed demographic changes over time using linear regression, and changes in characteristics, diagnoses, operations, and outcomes using Poisson analysis. Data included 1,484,116 EGS hospital episodes. The number and age- and sex-standardized rate, per 100,000 population, of EGS admissions have increased over time, whereas that of EGS operations have decreased over time. Male admissions were unchanged, but with fewer operations over time, whereas female admissions increased significantly over time with no change in the operation rate. Poisson analysis demonstrated secular trends in demographics, admissions, operations, and outcomes in depth. This 20-year epidemiological study of all EGS hospital episodes in Scotland has enhanced our understanding of secular trends of EGS, including demographics, diagnoses, operations, and outcomes. These data will help inform stakeholders in EGS service planning and delivery, as well as in surgical training, what has occurred in recent history."

Retrospective study using data from Health and Retirement Study interviews linked to Medicare claims (2000-2012). National population-based dataset. Medicare beneficiaries who underwent EMAS. High illness burden, defined as ≥2 of the following vulnerabilities: functional dependence, dementia, use of helpers, multimorbidity, poor prognosis, high healthcare utilization. In-hospital outcomes were complications and mortality. Postdischarge outcomes included emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and 365-day mortality. For individuals discharged alive who died within 365 days of surgery, outcomes included hospice use, hospitalization, ICU use, and ED use in the last 30 days of life. Multivariable regression was used to determine the association between illness burden and outcomes. Of 411 participants, 57% had high illness burden. More individuals with high illness burden had complications (45% vs 28% p=0.00) and in-hospital death (20% vs 9%, p=0.00) than those without. After discharge (n=349), individuals with high illness burden experienced more ED visits (57% vs 46%, P=.04) and were more likely to die (35% vs 13%, p=0.00). Of those who died after discharge (n=86), 75% had high illness burden, median survival was 67 days (range 21-141 days), 48% enrolled in hospice, 32% died in the hospital, 23% were in the ICU in the last 30 days of life and 37% had an ED visit in the last 30 days of life. Most older adults undergoing EMAS have preexisting high illness burden and experience high mortality and healthcare use in the year after surgery, particularly near the end of life. Concurrent surgical and palliative care may improve quality of life and end-of-life care in these people. J Am Geriatr Soc 66:2072-2078, 2018."

We sought to determine the impact of implementing a morning report (MR) model on patient outcomes in the trauma service of a tertiary care center. The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) Division of ACS implemented MR in October 2015, which consists of the trauma day team, the emergency general surgery day team, and a combined night float team. This study queried the UAMS Trauma Registry and the Arkansas Clinical Data Repository for all patients meeting the National Trauma Data Bank inclusion criteria from January 1, 2011 to April 30, 2018. Bivariate frequency statistics and generalized linear model were run using STATA V.14.2. A total of 11 253 patients (pre-MR, n=6556; post-MR, n=4697) were analyzed in this study. The generalized linear model indicates that implementation of MR resulted in a significant decrease in length of stay (LOS) in trauma patients. This study describes an approach to improving patient outcomes in a trauma surgery service of a tertiary care center. The data show how an MR session can allow for patients to get out of the hospital faster; however, broader implications of these sessions have yet to be studied. Further work is needed to describe the decisions being made that allow for a decreased LOS, what dynamics exist between the attendings and the residents in these sessions, and if these sessions can show some of the same benefits in other surgical services.

    "abstract": "Critically ill patients are often evaluated for an intra-abdominal catastrophe. In the absence of a preoperative diagnosis, abdominal exploration may be offered despite desperate circumstances. We hypothesize that (1) abdominal exploration for such patients is associated with a high mortality and (2) commonly obtained physiologic measures at laparotomy anticipate mortality. All acute care surgery (ACS) patients undergoing emergency laparotomy at a quaternary referral center during a 3-year period were reviewed. Inclusion was defined by emergency laparotomy in the operating room (OR) in a patient with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score ≥4 or bedside laparotomy in the ICU (BSL). Mortality was the primary endpoint and was stratified by demographics, admitting service, surgical findings, and physiology. Comparisons between OR and BSL were by Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney tests. 144 patients underwent emergency laparotomy (45 BSL vs. 99 OR). Overall mortality was 55.6% (77.8% BSL vs. 45.5% OR; p < 0.001). Mortality by admitting service was cardiac 71.4% (n=42), medical 70% (n=30), ACS 42% (n=50), and other 36.4% (n=22) services. Preoperative lactate levels were higher in nonsurvivors (2.7 vs. 8.5 mmol/L, p < 0.001), as was vasopressor use (62.5% vs. 97.5%, p < 0.001), acute kidney injury (51.6% vs. 72.5%, p < 0.01), leukocytosis (53.1% vs. 71.3%, p < 0.04), and anemia (45.3% vs. 71.3%, p < 0.01). The presence of any identifiable abdominal pathology established a 90% mortality rate. The need for BSL portends an extremely high mortality rate and is likely useful in preintervention counselling. Emergency OR laparotomy leads to mortality in nearly half of such patients and is anticipatable based on concurrent abnormal physiology."

A hybrid mail/electronic survey was sent to 2811 acute care hospitals that met the inclusion criteria of hospitals that care for adult patients (≥18 years old) with an emergency room (ER), ≥ 1 operating room (OR), and 24-h ER access. Hospitals were queried on whether they utilized an ACS model. The workforce composition among ACS and non-ACS hospitals was evaluated using X2 tests, t tests, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Survey response was 60% (N = 1690). ACS hospitals had a higher proportion of emergency surgeons who were female (20% vs. 14%, p < 0.0001), newly-trained (17% vs 10%, p < 0.0001), critical care trained (78% vs. 31%, p < 0.0001), and who had an additional degree (35% vs. 13%, p < 0.0001). More ACS hospitals had 24/7 in-house OR nursing staff (72% vs. 15%, p < 0.0001) and ancillary staff. ACS and non-ACS hospitals differ in their surgical workforce. It is clear that ACS hospitals have more human capital, which suggests that ACS hospitals may require more dedicated resources compared to non-ACS hospitals."

    "abstract": "Open abdomen (OA) and temporary abdominal closure (TAC) are common techniques to manage several surgical problems in trauma and emergency general surgery (EGS). Patients with an OA are subjected to prolonged mechanical ventilation. This can lead to increased rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). We hypothesized that patients who were extubated with an OA would have a decrease in ventilator hours and as a result would have a lower rate of VAP without an increase in extubation failures. A retrospective review was performed of all trauma and EGS patients managed at our institution with OA and TAC from January 2014 to February 2016. Patients were divided into cohorts consisting of those who were successfully extubated with an OA and those who were not. The number of extubation events and ventilator-free hours were calculated for each patient. Adverse events such as the need for reintubation with an OA and VAP were collected. Fifty-two patients (20 trauma, 32 EGS) were managed with an OA and TAC during the study period. Twenty-five patients (6 trauma, 19 EGS) had at least one extubation event with an OA. Median extubation events per patient was 3 (interquartile range, 1-5). The median ventilator-free hours for patients who were extubated was 101 hours (interquartile range, 39.42-260.46). Patients that were never extubated with an OA had higher rates of VAP (30.8% vs. 3.8%, p = 0.01). This study provides much needed data regarding the feasibility of extubation in trauma and EGS patients managed with an OA and TAC. Benefits of early extubation may include lower VAP rates in this population. Plans for reexploration hinder the decision to extubate in these patients. Therapeutic study, level IV."

    "abstract": "Hospital-level variation has been found to influence outcomes in emergency general surgery. However, whether the individual surgeon plays a role in this variation is unknown. We performed an analysis of the Florida State Inpatient Database (2010-2014), which is linked to the American Hospital Association's Annual Survey Database, including patients who emergently underwent 1 or more of 7 procedures (laparotomy, adhesiolysis, small bowel resection, colectomy, repair of a perforated gastric ulcer, appendectomy, or cholecystectomy). We used multilevel random effects modeling to quantify the amount of variation in mortality, complications, and 30-day readmissions attributable to surgeons. Patient clinical and demographic factors, as well as hospital-level factors, were introduced into the model in a forward stepwise fashion, and the percent of the variation attributable to surgeons was derived. Our study included 2,149 surgeons across 224 hospitals, with a total of 569,767 emergency general surgery cases. The overall unadjusted mortality rate was 3.8%, and the complication and readmission rates were 12.7% and 27.7%, respectively. Surgeon-level variation had the greatest impact on mortality, explaining 32.77% of the overall variability in mortality risk compared with 0.08% and 2.28% for complications and readmissions, respectively. Peptic ulcer disease operations were most susceptible to surgeon-level variation in mortality and readmissions, whereas appendectomies and cholecystectomies were least susceptible to surgeon-level variation for all outcomes. Surgeon-level variation contributes to a significant portion of mortality in EGS. This variation is most pronounced in surgery for peptic ulcer disease, a high-risk, low-frequency surgical condition. Programs to reduce mortality in emergency general surgery should address reducing variability in practice with attention to high-risk, low-frequency procedures."

Using the 2002-2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample we identified patients aged ≥18 years with an EGS admission. Patient demographics, hospitalization characteristics, rates of operation and mortality were compared between patients with interhospital transfer versus direct admissions. Interhospital transfers comprised 2% of EGS admissions. Interhospital transfers were more likely to be white, male, Medicare insured, and had higher rates of comorbidities. Interhospital transfers underwent more procedures/surgeries and had a higher mortality rate. Mortality remained elevated after controlling for patient characteristics. Interhospital transfers are at higher risk of mortality and undergo procedures/surgeries more frequently than direct admissions. Identification of contributing factors to this increased mortality may identify opportunities for decreasing mortality rate in EGS transfers."

Trauma and critical care-trained surgeons saw 836 (61.3%) patients. There was no difference in operative management between the two groups, however, trauma and critical care-trained surgeons had significantly less time to the operative room (7.0 vs 12.9 hours; P < .001), without a difference in duration of stay or costs. The subgroups of acute appendicitis and acute cholecystitis when treated by trauma and critical care-trained surgeons had less time to the operative room (8.4 vs 17.4 hours; P < .001), shorter hospital stay (2.5 vs 2.8 days; P = .021), and less emergency department cost ($822 vs $876; P = .012).

This pilot study was performed to investigate the safety, feasibility, and financial implications of providing postoperative care using an electronic clinic (eClinic) at a university hospital. An easy-to-use and secure eClinic platform was constructed in Epic (Epic Systems Corporation, Verona, WA). Patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and hernia repairs on an adult acute care surgery service were enrolled in this program over an 11-month period (March 2017 to January 2018). Patients with prolonged hospitalizations (greater than 4 nights), perioperative complications, drains, and open wounds were excluded. Demographics, clinical outcomes, encounter time, patient satisfaction survey results, and cost analysis were compared with the traditional clinic (tClinic) patient population. Two hundred thirty-three eligible patients (61% female; mean age 41 ± 16 years) were enrolled in this program. Their demographics were no different than the tClinic. Frequencies of readmission, reoperation, and emergency department visits (2.7%, 0%, and 4.2%, respectively) in the eClinic group were also similar to the tClinic group. However, total visit time was significantly shorter in the eClinic group (14 vs 145 minutes, P < 0.01). Anonymous surveys demonstrated a high degree of satisfaction, with 85% of patients expressing desire to utilize the eClinic again. This program enhanced the capacity for new visits to tClinic, with a resultant projected increase in additional operative cases and revenue for the health care system. A safe and efficient postoperative telemedicine program can be constructed utilizing a widely available electronic medical record system, which can improve patient satisfaction, optimize throughput, and increase gross charges for the healthcare system."

A national survey was conducted to ascertain factors associated with variations in EGS models of care, with particular focus on ACS use. A hybrid mail/electronic survey was sent in 2015 to 2,811 acute care hospitals with an emergency room and an operating room. If a respondent indicated that the approach to EGS was a dedicated clinical team whose scope encompasses EGS (± trauma, ± elective general surgery, ± burns), the hospital was considered an ACS hospital. Survey response was 60.1% (n = 1,690); 272 (16.1%) of these hospitals reported having used an ACS model of care for EGS patients. Teaching status and general hospital practices (for example, interventional radiology available within one hour) were associated with ACS use. In bivariate analyses, ACS use was associated with many EGS-specific practices (40.1% of ACS hospitals freed their surgeons of daytime clinical responsibilities after operating overnight vs. 4.7% of general surgeon on call (GSOC) hospitals; p < 0.0001). There are wide variations in EGS practices in the United States, with use of an ACS model of care being relatively low despite reported benefits of ACS models of care on EGS access, quality, and costs. Hospital factors associated with using ACS models are overall size and higher level of existing resources. These findings could be applied to the development of centers of excellence for EGS care."

The purpose of this study was to prospectively examine the case mix of admissions and consultations to an ACS service at a tertiary centre to identify the frequency and distribution of both operatively and nonoperatively managed EGS conditions. In this prospective cohort study, we evaluated consecutive patients assessed by the ACS team between July 1 and Aug. 31, 2015, at a large Canadian tertiary care centre. This included all consultations and outside hospital transfers. Diagnoses, demographic characteristics, comorbidities, intervention(s), complications, readmission and in-hospital death were captured. The ACS team was involved in the care of 359 patients, 176 (49.0%) of whom were admitted under the direct care of the ACS team. Nonoperative care was indicated in 82 patients (46.6%) admitted to the ACS service and 151 (82.5%) of those admitted to a non-ACS service (p < 0.001). Bowel obstruction (37 patients [21.0%]) was the most common reason for admission, followed by wound/abscess (24 [13.6%), biliary disease (24 [13.6%]) and appendiceal disease (23 [13.1%]). Rates of 30-day return to the emergency department and readmission were 17.0% and 9.1%, respectively, and the in-hospital mortality rate was 1.7%. Acute care surgery teams care for a wide breadth of disease, a considerable amount of which is managed nonoperatively.

Despite the high volume, acuity and complexity of the patient populations served by EGS services, little has been reported about the services' structure, processes, case mix or outcomes. This study begins a national surveillance effort to define and advance surgical quality in an important and diverse surgical population. A national cross-sectional study of EGS services was conducted during a 24-hour period in January 2017 at 14 hospitals across 7 Canadian provinces recruited through the Canadian Association of General Surgeons Acute Care Committee. Patients admitted to the EGS service, new consultations and off-service patients being followed by the EGS service during the study period were included. Patient demographic information and data on operations, procedures and complications were collected. Twelve sites reported resident coverage. Most services did not include trauma. Ten sites had protected operating room time. Overall, 393 patient encounters occurred during the study period (195/386 [50.5%] operative and 191/386 [49.5%] nonoperative), with a mean of 3.8 operations per service. The patient population was complex, with 136 patients (34.6%) having more than 3 comorbidities. There was a wide case mix, including gallbladder disease (69 cases [17.8%]) and appendiceal disease (31 [8.0%]) as well as complex emergencies, such as obstruction (56 [14.5%]) and perforation (23 [5.9%]). The characteristics and case mix of these Canadian EGS services are heterogeneous, but all services are busy and provide comprehensive operative and nonoperative care to acutely ill patients with high levels of comorbidity. Les services de chirurgie générale d'urgence (CGU) gagnent en popularité au Canada en tant qu'approches systémiques aux urgences chirurgicales. Malgré le volume élevé, le caractère urgent et la complexité des populations de patients desservies en CGU, peu de rapports ont porté sur la structure, les processus, les clientèles ou les résultats de ces services. La présente étude instaure une démarche de surveillance nationale qui servira à définir et à améliorer la qualité des chirurgies destinées à cette population importante et hétérogène.

On y a inclus les patients admis dans les services de CGU, les nouvelles consultations et les patients de l'extérieur suivis par les services de CGU pendant la période de l'étude. On a recueilli les caractéristiques démographiques des patients et les données sur les interventions, les procédures et les complications. Douze sites ont fait état de la couverture assurée par les résidents. La plupart des services ont exclu la traumatologie. Dix sites disposaient de temps protégé au bloc opératoire. En tout, 393 rencontres avec des patients ont eu lieu pendant la période de l'étude (195/386 [50,4 %] chirurgicales, 191/386 [49,5 %] non chirurgicales), avec une moyenne de 3,8 chirurgies par service. La population regroupait des cas complexes : 136 patients (34,6 %) présentaient plus de 3 comorbidités. La clientèle était diversifiée et comprenait des cas de maladie de la vésicule biliaire (69 cas [17,8 %]) et de l'appendice (31 [8,0 %]), de même que des situations d'urgence délicates, telle qu'obstruction (56 [14,5 %]) et perforation (23 [5,9 %]). Leurs caractéristiques et leurs clientèles sont hétérogènes, mais les services de CGU sont tous achalandés et ils offrent tous des soins chirurgicaux et non chirurgicaux complets à des patients gravement malades porteurs d'importantes comorbidités."

    "title": "Emergency General Surgery-A Misnomer?",
    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) is defined as the urgent assessment and treatment of nontrauma, general surgical emergencies involving adults. Acute surgical emergencies often represent the most common reason for hospital admission with diagnoses, including bowel obstruction and appendicitis. EGS is a growing surgical subspecialty that includes both operative and nonoperative management of acutely ill patients. We sought to assess the burden of nonoperative care in EGS patients at our academic medical center. This study was conducted by retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from patients entered into the Duke EGS Registry between July 1, 2016 and September 10, 2017. Fifty-six per cent (n = 771) of patients in the Duke EGS Registry (n = 1377) were managed nonoperatively as compared with 44 per cent (n = 606) who were managed operatively. Nonoperative management of disease represents a large subset of EGS and, therefore, needs further investigation to improve processes, outcomes, and standardization of care."

    "abstract": "Diversion of unused prescription opioids is a major contributor to the current United States opioid epidemic. We aimed to study the variation of opioid prescribing in emergency surgery. Between October 2016 and March 2017, all patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, or inguinal hernia repair in the acute care surgery service of 1 academic center were included. For each patient, we systematically reviewed the electronic medical record and the prescribing pharmacy platform to identify: (1) history of opioid abuse, (2) opioid intake 3 months preoperatively, (3) number of opioid pills prescribed, (4) prescription of nonopioid pain medications (eg, acetaminophen, ibuprofen), and (5) the need for opioid prescription refills. The mean and range of opioid pills prescribed, as well as their oral morphine equivalent, were calculated. A total of 255 patients were included (43.5% laparoscopic appendectomy, 44.3% laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and 12.1% inguinal hernia repair). The mean age was 47.5 years, 52.1% were female, 11.4% had a history of opioid use, and 92.5% received opioid prescriptions upon hospital discharge. Only 70.9% of patients were instructed to use nonopioid pain medications. The mean and range of opioid pills prescribed were 17.4; 0-56 (laparoscopic appendectomy), 17.1; 0-75 (laparoscopic cholecystectomy), and 20.9; 0-50 (inguinal hernia repair), while the range of prescribed oral morphine equivalent was 0-600 mg for laparoscopic appendectomy/laparoscopic cholecystectomy and 0-375 mg for inguinal hernia repair. No patients required any opioid medication refills. Even within the same surgical service, wide variation of opioid prescription was observed. Guidelines that standardize pain management may help prevent opioid overprescribing."

    "abstract": "Safety-net hospitals provide care to an inherently underprivileged patient population. These hospitals have previously been shown to have inferior surgical outcomes after complex, elective procedures, but little is known about how hospital payer-mix correlates with outcomes after more common, emergent operations. The University HealthSystem Consortium database was queried for all emergency general surgery procedures performed from 2009 to 2015. Emergency general surgery was defined as the seven operative procedures recently identified as contributing most to the national burden. Only urgent and emergent admissions were included (n = 653,305). Procedure-specific cohorts were created and hospitals were grouped according to safety-net burden. Multivariate analyses were done to study the effect of safety-net burden on hospital outcomes. For all seven emergency procedures, patients at hospitals with a high safety-net burden were more likely to be young and black (p < 0.01 each). Patients at high-burden hospitals had similar severity of illness scores to those at other hospitals. Compared with lower burden hospitals, in-hospital mortality rates at high-burden hospitals were similar or lower in five of seven procedures (p = NS or < 0.01, respectively). After adjusting for patient factors, high-burden hospitals had similar or lower odds of readmission in six of seven procedures, hospital length of stay in four of seven procedures, and cost of care in three of seven procedures (p = NS or < 0.01, respectively). Safety-net hospitals provide emergency general surgery services without compromising patient outcomes or incurring greater healthcare resources. These data may help inform the vital role these institutions play in the healthcare of vulnerable patients in the USA."

    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of advanced cirrhosis among operative candidates poses a major challenge for the acute care surgeon. The severity of hepatic dysfunction, degree of portal hypertension, emergency of surgery, and severity of patients' comorbidities constitute predictors of postoperative mortality. Comprehensive history taking, physical examination, and thorough review of laboratory and imaging examinations typically elucidate clinical evidence of hepatic dysfunction, portal hypertension, and/or their complications. Utilization of specific scoring systems (Child-Pugh and MELD) adds objectivity to stratifying the severity of hepatic dysfunction. Hypovolemia and coagulopathy often represent major preoperative concerns. Resuscitation mandates judicious use of intravenous fluids and blood products. As a general rule, the most expeditious and least invasive operative procedure should be planned. Laparoscopic approaches, advanced energy devices, mechanical staplers, and topical hemostatics should be considered whenever applicable to improve safety. Precise operative technique must acknowledge common distortions in hepatic anatomy, as well as the risk of massive hemorrhage from porto-systemic collaterals. Preventive measures, as well as both clinical and laboratory vigilance, for postoperative hepatic and renal decompensation are essential."

    "abstract": "The provision of emergency general surgery services is a global issue, with important implications for patients and workforce. The aim of this study was to analyze the characteristics of emergency general surgical patients in the United Kingdom, with reference to diagnostic case mix, operative workload, comorbidity, discharge destination, and outcomes, to facilitate comparisons and future service development. This is a cross-sectional population-based study based in the National Health Service in Scotland, one of the home nations of the United Kingdom. All patients aged 16 or older admitted under the care of a general surgeon, as an emergency, to a National Health Service hospital in Scotland, in 2016, were included. There were 81,446 emergency general surgery admissions by 66,498 patients. Median episode age was 53 years. There were more female patients than male (55% vs 45%, p < 0.0001). The most common diagnoses were nonspecific abdominal pain (20.2%), cholecystitis (7.2%), constipation (3.4%), pancreatitis (3.1%), diverticular disease (3.1%), and appendicitis (3.1%). Only 25% of patients had operations (n = 20,292). The most frequent procedures were appendicectomy (13.1%), endoscopy (11.3%), and drainage of skin lesions (9.7%). Diagnoses and operations differed with age. Overall median length of stay was 1 day. With a 6-month follow-up, patients older than 75 years had a 19.8% mortality rate. Emergency general surgery in the United Kingdom is a high-volume, diagnostically diverse, and low-operative volume specialty with high short-term mortality rate in elderly patients. Consideration should be given to alternative service delivery models, which make better use of surgeons' skills while also ensuring optimal care for patients who are increasingly elderly and have complex chronic health problems.

    "abstract": "An association between lack of insurance and inferior outcomes has been well described for a number of surgical emergencies, yet little is known about the relationship of payor status and outcomes of patients undergoing emergent surgical repair for upper gastrointestinal (UGI) perforations. We evaluated the association of payor status and in-hospital mortality for patients undergoing emergency surgery for UGI perforations in the United States. Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was queried to identify patients between 18 and 64 years of age who underwent emergent (open or laparoscopic) repair for UGI perforations secondary to peptic ulcer disease (2010-2014). Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were major and minor postoperative complications. The main predictor outcome was insurance status (Private, Medicaid, Uninsured). Univariate and multivariable regression analyses were performed. Data were weighted to provide national estimates. 21,005 patients underwent surgical repair for UGI perforations. Patients with private insurance represented the largest payor group (47%). After adjustment of other factors, payor status was not a statistically significant predictor of in-hospital mortality (Medicaid vs. Private: [OR] 1.1; 95% [CI] 0.67-1.81; Uninsured vs. Private: OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.52-1.61). However, payor status remained a statistically significant predictor of major postoperative complications (Medicaid vs. Private [OR] 1.4; 95% CI 1.1, 1.8; Uninsured vs. Private [OR]1.2, 95% CI 0.9, 1.5) and minor postoperative complications (Medicaid vs. Private [OR] 1.4; 95% CI 1.1, 1.9; Uninsured vs. Private [OR]1.2, 95% CI 0.9, 1.6). Emergency surgery for UGI perforations is associated with high mortality and morbidity across all payor classes; however, Medicaid is a predictor for both major and minor postoperative complications. Preventing perforation through preventative measures will be key to reducing the burden of peptic ulcer disease across all populations."

    "abstract": "The Joint Trauma System has demonstrated improved outcomes through coordinated research and process improvement programs. With fewer combat trauma patients, our military American College of Surgeons level 2 trauma center's ability to maintain a strong trauma Process Improvement (PI) program has become difficult. As emergency general surgery (EGS) patients are similar to trauma patients, our Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (TACS) service developed an EGS PI program analogous to what is done in trauma. We describe the implementation of our novel EGS PI program and its effect on institutional PI proficiency. An EGS registry was developed in 2013. Inclusion criteria were based on AAST published literature. In 2015, EGS registrar and PI coordinator positions were developed and filled with existing trauma staff. A formal EGS PI program began January 1, 2016. Pre- and post-program data was compared to determine the effect including EGS PI events had on increasing yield into our trauma PI program. In 2016, TACS saw 1001 EGS consults. Four hundred forty-four met criteria for registry inclusion. Eighty-two patients had 131 PI events; re-admission within 30 days, unplanned therapeutic intervention, and unplanned ICU admission were the most common events. Capture of EGS PI events yielded a 49% increase compared with 2015. Overall patient volume and PI events post EGS PI program initiation exceeded those prior to implementation. These data suggest that extending trauma PI principles to EGS may be beneficial in maintaining inter-war military and/or lower volume trauma center readiness."

Since emergency general surgery (EGS) and trauma patients share similarities, we merged the care of our EGS and trauma patients into one acute care surgery (ACS) team. An EGS PI program was developed based on trauma PI principles to facilitate continued identification of opportunities for improvement despite our decline in trauma admissions. Analysis of the first 18 months of combined ACS PI data is presented. EGS registry inclusion criteria was based on published Association for the Surgery of Trauma's recommendations. Program components and PI categories were based on our existing trauma PI program. Dedicated coordinators actively reviewed and cataloged patient care and outcomes. Deviations from standard practice patterns, unplanned interventions, and other complications were abstracted, categorized, and evaluated through levels of review similar to accepted trauma PI principles. Data for the first six quarters were collated and trends were analyzed. Over 18 months, 696 EGS patients met registry inclusion criteria, with 468 patients (67%) undergoing operative intervention. Over the same time, 353 trauma patients were admitted with 158 undergoing operative intervention (56.4%). Of the 696 EGS patients and 353 trauma patients, 226 (32%) and 243 (69%) PI events were identified, respectively. Common events included unplanned therapies, re-admissions, and unplanned ICU admissions. Based on analysis of all events, four new areas for improvement initiatives were identified. Results of these initiatives included implementation of a multi-disciplinary EGS PI committee, consensus protocols, and departmental and hospital-wide actions. In an 18-month period, integration of our EGS patients into a novel, combined ACS PI program facilitated recognition of an additional 226 PI events and provided a substrate for continued improvements in patient care."

    "abstract": "The overuse of temporary abdominal closure and second look (SL) laparotomy in emergency general surgery (EGS) cases has been questioned in the recent literature. In an effort to hopefully decrease the number of open abdomen (OA) patients, we hypothesize that reviewing our cases, many of these SL patients could be managed with single-stage operative therapy and thus decrease the number of OA patients. This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data from Jun 2013-Jun 2014, evaluating EGS patients managed with an OA who required bowel resection in either index or SL laparotomy. Demographics, clinical variables, complications and mortality were collected. Fisher's exact t test was used for statistical analysis. During this time frame, 96 patients were managed with OA and 59 patients required a bowel resection. 55 (57%) of those required one bowel resection at the index operation with 4 (4.2%) only requiring one bowel resection at the second operation. In the patients requiring bowel resections, 18 (30%) required a resection at SL. At SL laparotomy, resection was required for questionably viable bowel at the index operation 60% (11), whereas 39% (7) had normal appearing bowel. Indications for resection at SL laparotomy included evolution of existing ischemia, new onset ischemia, staple line revision, and \"other\". 23 patients (39%) were hemodynamically unstable, contributing to the need for temporary abdominal closure. In the multivariate analysis, preoperative shock was the only predictor of need for further resection. Complications and mortality were similar in both groups. Almost one-fifth of the patients undergoing SL laparotomy for open abdomen required bowel resections, with 6.8% of those having normal appearing bowel at index operation, therefore in select EGS patients, SL laparotomy is a reasonable strategy."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis has been cited to be the most common abdominal disorder that requires acute care surgery in the pediatric population. Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocols are multimodal perioperative care pathways designed to achieve early recovery after surgical procedures by maintaining preoperative organ function and reducing the profound stress response following surgery. Such pathways have been found to enhance quality of care for surgical patients as well as improve recovery and shorten hospital stays. The purpose of this study was to determine the key factors that facilitate same-day discharge (SDD) and early return to normal activities after laparoscopic appendectomies in children. This is a single-center retrospective chart review of pediatric patients (<18 y old) who underwent appendectomies for acute appendicitis from January 2015 to April 2017. The patient population was divided into two groups: those with SDD and those who were discharged one or more days after surgery. SDD was defined as discharge less than 24 h of surgical admission. Patient factors, including prehospital, preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative factors, were compared and analyzed between the two groups and statistically evaluated using Fisher's exact test for categorical data and student t-test for continuous variables. Two hundred forty eight patients were found under International Classification of Diseases-9 and International Classification of Diseases-10 codes for acute appendicitis. Of these, 63 were excluded due to perforated appendicitis, nonoperative management, interval appendectomies, or misdiagnosis. The remaining 185 had laparoscopic appendectomies; 59.5% (n = 110) were SDDs and 40.5% (n = 75) stayed more than one day. No significant difference was found for time between emergency room arrival and surgical admission (5.27 versus 5.4 h; P = 08.) but SDD patients had a significantly shorter time between surgical admission and operation (5.8 versus 11.4 h; P <0.001). SDD patients and non-SDD patients had no significant difference in rate of complications (0% versus 1.3%; P = 0.4). There was no significant difference in readmission rates between the two groups (2.7% versus 2.7%; P = 1). Total hospital charges, which indirectly reflect costs, were significantly less for SDD ($29,195 versus $33,703; P <0.001). Surgical leadership can be effective in facilitating SDD without increasing readmission rates or complications and helps reduce hospital costs, decreases chances of nosocomial infection, and increases patient and family satisfaction."

Clinical decision making in this group is challenging and current risk prediction tools extrapolate data from cohorts of younger patients. This is the first UK study to examine risk factors predicting in-hospital mortality in older acute surgical patients undergoing comprehensive geriatric assessment. Methods This was a prospective study of consecutive patients aged ≥75 years admitted non-electively to general surgery wards between September 2014 and February 2017 who were reviewed by an elderly medicine in-reach service. Results A total of 577 patients were included with a mean age of 82.9 years. There was a female predominance (56%). The majority were living at home alone or with carers (93%) and most were independent in basic activities of daily living (79%). Over two-thirds (69%) were mobile with no walking aids or use of a walking stick and overt here-quarters (79%) had no cognitive impairment. Seventy-seven per cent of patients were managed non-operatively. The in-hospital mortality rate was 6.9%. Female sex (p=0.031), dependence in activities of daily living (p<0.001), cognitive impairment (p<0.001) and incontinence (p<0.001) were predictors of in-hospital mortality. ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) grade ≥3 was also associated with increased in-hospital mortality (odds ratio: 5.3, 95% confidence interval: 2.6-10.7). Conclusions Older general surgical patients present a high level of complexity. This study highlights the predictive role of mobility, functional and cognitive impairment when assessing this population. Accurate risk stratification requires global assessment by teams experienced in care of the older patient rather than the traditional focus on co-morbidities."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) is characterized by high rates of morbidity and mortality. Though checklists and associated communication-based huddle strategies have improved outcomes, these tools have never been specifically examined in EGS. We hypothesized that use of an evidence-based communication tool aimed to trigger intraoperative discussion could improve communication in the EGS operating room (OR). We designed a set of discussion prompts based on modifiable factors identified from previously published studies aimed to encourage all team members to speak up and to centralize awareness of patient disposition and intraoperative transfusion practices. This tool was pilot-tested using OR human patient simulators and was then rolled out to EGS ORs at an academic medical center. The perceived effect of our tool's implementation was evaluated through mixed-methodologic presurvey and postsurvey analysis. Preimplementation and postimplementation survey-based data revealed that providers reported the EGS-focused discussion prompts as improving team communication in EGS. A trend toward shared awareness of intraoperative events was observed; however, nurses described cultural impedance of discussion initiation. Providers described a need for further reinforcement of the tool and its indications during implementation. Use of a discussion-based communication tool is perceived as supporting team communication in the EGS OR and led to a trend toward improving a shared understanding of intraoperative events. Analyses suggest the need for enhanced reinforcement of use during implementation and improvement of team-based education regarding EGS. Furthermore work is needed to understand the full impact of this evidence-based tool on OR team dynamics and EGS patient outcomes."

AAST EGS grades were assigned by two independent reviewers. Inter-rater reliability was measured using the agreement statistic (kappa). Final AAST grade was correlated with patient and treatment factors using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Two hundred twenty-five patients were identified: grade I (n = 152, 67.6%), II (n = 44, 19.6%), III (n = 25, 11.1%), IV (n = 0, 0.0%), and V (n = 4, 1.8%). At Mayo Clinic Rochester, AAST grades ranged from I-III. The kappa was 1.0, demonstrating 100% agreement between reviewers. Within the South African patients, grades included II, III, and V, with a kappa of 0.34, due to issues of the grading system application to this patient population. Treatment received correlated with AAST grade; less severe breast infections (grade I-II) received more oral antibiotics (correlation [-0.23, P = 0.0004]), however, higher AAST grades (III) received more intravenous antibiotics (correlation 0.29, P <0.0001). The AAST EGS breast infection grading system demonstrates reliability and ease for disease classification, and correlates with required treatment, in patients presenting with low-to-moderate severity infections at an academic medical center; however, it needs further refinement before being applicable to patients with more severe disease presenting for treatment in low-/middle-income countries."

Patients who underwent an emergency general surgery procedure from 2013 to 2015 were identified using a local American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (ACS-NSQIP) database. Outcomes of interest included 30-d mortality, all morbidity, and severe morbidity. Multivariate analyses were conducted using a logistic regression model using clinically relevant covariates to determine predictors of the outcome measures. A total of 974 patients were included in the final analysis. The prolonged median time from ED presentation to OR was predictive of all morbidity (14.3 h versus 13.3 h, P = 0.009) and severe morbidity (13.3 h versus 14.4 h, P = 0.063) on univariate analysis. Time from ED presentation to OR was not predictive of mortality (13.5 h versus 13.6 h, P = 0.474). Multivariate analysis demonstrated an adjusted increased odd of morbidity of 2.3 (95% CI: 1.01-5.24) for priority level A cases within the fourth quartile compared to that of the first quartile of time (P = 0.048). This study corroborates with known data that morbidity and mortality increases in patients who are older, have multiple comorbidities, and higher ASA class.

While open procedures are still widely used for treatment, laparoscopic procedures may have important advantages in certain patient populations. We aim to analyze differences in outcomes between the two for treatment of bowel obstruction. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program was used to find patients that underwent emergent or non-elective surgery for SBO. Propensity matching was used to create comparable groups. Logistic regression was used to assess differences in the primary outcome of interest, return to operating room, and morbidity and mortality outcomes. Logistic regression was also used to assess the contribution of various preoperative demographic and comorbidity characteristics to 30-day mortality. A total of 24,028 patients underwent surgery for SBO from 2005 to 2011. Of those, 3391 were laparoscopic. Propensity matching resulted in 6782 matched patients. Laparoscopic cases had significantly decreased odds of experiencing any morbidity and wound complications compared to open cases in bowel-resection and adhesiolysis-only cases. There was no significant difference found for odds of returning to operating room. Laparoscopic cases resulted in significantly shorter hospital stays than open cases (7.18 vs.10.84 days, p < 0.0001). Increasing age, American Society of Anesthesiologists class greater than three, and the presence of respiratory comorbidities resulted in increased odds of mortality. Underweight body mass index (BMI) (< 18.5) increased odds of mortality while greater than normal BMI (> 25) decreased odds of mortality. Analysis of emergent SBO cases between 2005 and 2015 demonstrates that laparoscopy is not utilized as often as open approaches in surgical treatment. Laparoscopic surgery resulted in reduced postoperative morbidity and significantly shorter hospital stays compared to open intervention and was not associated with significant differences in odds of reoperation compared to open surgery."

We evaluated hospitalization charges, operating charges, and variations in operating time by surgeon volume for three common EGS procedures. Using Maryland's Health Services Cost Review Commission database, we performed a retrospective study of laparoscopic appendectomies, laparoscopic cholecystectomies, and open bowel resections performed by general surgeons among adult patients from July 2012 to September 2014. We compared operating charges to total hospitalization charges and quantified variations in operating time for each procedure. We then divided patients into quartiles based on their surgeon's procedure-specific case volume and used hierarchical linear regressions to calculate differences in both operating time and charges between quartiles. We identified 3194 appendectomies, 4143 cholecystectomies, and 1478 bowel resections. Operating charges accounted for one-quarter (26.9%) of total hospitalization charges and widespread variation existed in operating time (appendectomies: median 79 min [interquartile range 66-100 min], cholecystectomies: 96 min [76-125 min], bowel resections: 155 min [117-209 min]). After adjustment, low-volume surgeons relative to high-volume surgeons did not operate statistically longer for appendectomies (+1%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -2% to 5%) but operated +16% (95% CI: 12%-20%) longer for cholecystectomies (+14 min) and +40% (95% CI: 30%-50%) longer for bowel resections (+59 min). Adjusted median operating charges from low-volume surgeons relative to high-volume surgeons were $554 (26.7%), $621 (22.0%), and $1801 (47.0%) greater for appendectomies, cholecystectomies, and bowel resections, respectively. Operating charges contributed substantially to total EGS hospitalization charges, where low-volume surgeons operated longer and had higher operative charges relative to high-volume surgeons. Reducing variations in operating times and charges represents an opportunity to alleviate the financial burden from EGS procedures."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate preoperative risk factors in both operative and non-operative management, as well as to describe the outcomes of colonic emergencies within a cancer patient population. A single institution cancer database was reviewed retrospectively to identify patients with an active cancer diagnosis who had an emergency general surgery consult placed for an acute colonic pathology. A total of 87 patients were included. Among these, 38 patients underwent operative and 49 underwent nonoperative management. There was a 71% rate of postoperative complications in the operative group; these patients were also more likely to require intensive care unit admission (P < .001), die during their hospitalization (P = .003), have a greater 30-day mortality (P = .001) and were less likely to be discharged to home (P < .001). No patients in the nonoperative group required admission to the intensive care unit, 3 of the 49 (6%) died during their hospitalization, and 75% of nonoperative patients were discharged to home. When clinically appropriate, patients with active cancer who present with an acute colonic emergency can undergo nonoperative management safely. In contrast, patients undergoing operative management have a substantial risk of morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "Background  The burden of frail patients undergoing emergency general surgery (EGS) is increasing rapidly and this population is particularly susceptible to postoperative cardiopulmonary complications and mortality. We aimed to determine the association between frailty, as defined by the previously described modified frailty index (mFI), and postoperative respiratory complications (unplanned reintubation, pneumonia, and prolonged ventilation), cardiac complications (myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest), and mortality. We also sought to identify the most significant determinants of frailty in the highest risk patients based on the specific variables comprising the mFI. Methods  We performed a retrospective observational analysis of the prospectively collected American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Files from 2005 to 2015 identified 132,765 inpatients who underwent EGS. mFI scores were calculated for each patient. The effect of increasing frailty on unplanned reintubation, pneumonia, prolonged ventilation, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and mortality was evaluated using bivariate analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare mFI with additional predictor variables including race, gender, physical status as defined by the American Society of Anesthesiologists, disseminated cancer, renal failure, smoking status, sepsis, wound presence/classification, dyspnea, and previous ventilator dependence. Results  Unplanned reintubation, pneumonia, prolonged ventilation, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and mortality were significantly associated with frailty, and the odds of each postoperative complication increased with increasing mFI score. Of the frailest patients (mFI ≥3) that experienced cardiopulmonary complications or mortality, the variables of the mFI that contributed most to frailty were hypertension requiring medication and functional status before surgery. Conclusions  A higher mFI score is associated with increased odds of postoperative cardiopulmonary complications and mortality in the EGS population. Specific variables of the mFI can also provide valuable information for assessing odds in the frailest patients undergoing EGS."

Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis score and AAST EGS grade were assigned. The primary outcome was association of AAST EGS grade with complication development, duration of stay, and interventions. Secondary predictors of severity included tissue cultures, cross-sectional imaging, and duration of inpatient antibiotic therapy. Summary and univariate analyses were performed. A total of 223 patients were included (mean ± SD age of 55.1 ± 17.0 years, 55% male). The majority of patients received cross sectional imaging (169, 76%) or an operative procedure (155, 70%). Skin and soft tissue infection tissue culture results included no growth (51, 24.5%), monomicrobial (83, 39.9%), and polymicrobial (74, 35.6%). Increased AAST EGS grade was associated with operative interventions, intensive care unit utilization, complication severity (Clavien-Dindo index), duration of hospital stay, inpatient antibiotic therapy, mortality, and hospital readmission. The AAST EGS grade for SSTI demonstrates the ability to correspond with several important outcomes.

    "abstract": "Fatigued surgeon performance has only been assessed in simulated sessions or retrospectively after a night on call. We hypothesized that objectively assessed fatigue of acute care surgeons affects patient outcome. Five acute care surgery services prospectively identified emergency cases over 27 months. Emergency cases were defined by the surgeon identifying the patient as requiring immediate operation upon consultation or admission. Within 48 hours, surgeons reported sleep time accumulated before operation, if nonclinical delays to operation occurred, and patient volume during the shift. To maximize differences, fatigued surgeons were defined as performing a case after midnight without having slept in the prior 18 hours. Rested surgeons performed cases at or before 8 PM or after at least 3 hours of sleep before operation. A four-level ordinal scale was used to assign case complexity. Hierarchical logistic regression models were constructed to assess the impact of fatigue on mortality and major morbidity while controlling for center and patient level factors. Of 882 cases collected, 611 met criteria for fatigue or rested. Of these cases, 370 were performed at night and 182 by a fatigued surgeon. Rested surgeons were more likely to be operating on an older or female patient; other characteristics were similar. Mortality and major morbidity were similar between fatigued and rested surgeons (12.1% vs 12.1% and 46.9% vs 48.9%), respectively. After controlling for center and patient factors, surgeon fatigue did not affect mortality or major morbidity. Mortality variance was 6.30% and morbidity variance was 7.02% among centers. Acute care surgeons have similar outcomes in a fatigued or rested state. Work schedules for acute care surgeons should not be adjusted to shifts less than 24 hours for the sole purpose of improving patient outcomes. Prognostic study, level IV."

However, EGS comprises a wide spectrum of diseases. Our goal was to determine which EGS diseases had better outcomes at high-volume hospitals. We undertook a retrospective analysis of the National Inpatient Sample database for 2013 (a nationwide representative sample). Patients with EGS diseases were identified using American Association for the Surgery of Trauma definitions. A hierarchical logistic regression model was used to measure risk-adjusted probability of death, adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, insurance type, and comorbidities. Patients were then grouped into 16 risk groups based upon their predicted probability of death. We then compared observed mortality rates at high- versus low-volume hospitals within each risk group. Nationwide, 3,006,615 patients with EGS diseases were treated at 4,083 hospitals in 2013. Patients with predicted risk of death of 4% or higher (275,615 patients, 9.2%) had lower observed mortality rates at high-volume hospitals than at low-volume hospitals (7.7% vs. 10.2%, p < 0.001). We estimated that 1,002 deaths were potentially preventable if high-risk patients who were treated at low-volume hospitals were instead transferred to high-volume hospitals. EGS patients with predicted risk of death of 4% or higher experience lower mortality rates at high-volume hospitals than at low-volume hospitals. A regional system of EGS care that enables rapid transfer of high-risk patients to high-volume hospitals may prevent several deaths.

The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) disease severity grading system is valid and generalizable for appendicitis. We aimed to evaluate hospitalization costs incurred by patients with increasing disease severity as defined by the AAST. We hypothesized that increasing disease severity would be associated with greater cost. Single-institution review of adults (≥ 18 years old) undergoing appendectomy for acute appendicitis during 2010-2016. Demographics, comorbidities, operative details, hospital stay, complications, and institutional cost data were collected. AAST grades were assigned by two independent reviewers based on operative findings. Total cost was ascertained from billing data and normalized to median grade I cost. Non-parametric linear regression was utilized to assess the association of several covariates and cost. Evaluated patients (n = 1187) had a median [interquartile range] age of 37 [26-55] and 45% (n = 542) were female. There were 747 (63%) patients with Grade I disease, 219 (19%) with Grade II, 126 (11%) with Grade III, 50 (4%) with Grade IV, and 45 (4%) with Grade V. The median normalized cost of hospitalization was 1 [0.9-1.2]. Increasing AAST grade was associated with increasing cost (ρ = 0.39; p < 0.0001). Length of stay exhibited the strongest association with cost (ρ = 0.5; p < 0.0001), followed by AAST grade (ρ = 0.39), Clavien-Dindo Index (ρ = 0.37; p < 0.0001), age-adjusted Charlson score (ρ = 0.31; p < 0.0001), and surgical wound classification (ρ = 0.3; p < 0.0001). Increasing anatomic severity, as defined by AAST grade, is associated with increasing cost of hospitalization and clinical outcomes. The AAST grade compares favorably to other predictors of cost. Future analyses evaluating appendicitis reimbursement stand to benefit from utilization of the AAST grade."

We examined the available RST with the intent of identifying a tool that comprehensively reflects an EGS patients perioperative risk for death or complication. The ideal tool would combine individualized assessment with relative ease of use.

We hypothesized that an increase in RDW at hospital discharge in critically ill patients who received emergency general surgery (EGS) would be associated with increased mortality after hospital discharge. We performed a two-center observational study of patients treated in medical and surgical intensive care units. We studied 1567 patients, who received critical care between 1998 and 2012 who underwent EGS and survived hospitalization. The exposure of interest was RDW within 24 hours of hospital discharge and categorized a priori in quintiles as ≤13.3%, 13.3% to 14.0%, 14.0% to 14.7%, 14.7% to 15.8%, 15.8% to 17.0% and >17.0%.

We sought to identify risk factors for mortality after emergent colectomy for ischemic colitis using a clinical outcomes database. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project database was queried from 2010 to 2015 to identify emergent colectomies performed for ischemic colitis using Current Procedural Terminology and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors associated with increased risk of mortality. A total of 4548 patients undergoing emergent colectomies for ischemic colitis were identified. Overall, 30-day postoperative mortality was 25.3%. On univariate analysis, preoperative risk factors associated with a higher rate of mortality include dyspnea, functional status, ventilator dependency, history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ascites, congestive heart failure exacerbation, hypertension, dialysis dependency, cancer, open wounds, chronic steroids, weight loss >10%, transfusions within 72 hours before surgery, septic shock and duration from hospital admission to surgery. Factors that were significant for mortality on logistic regression analysis include elderly age, poor functional status, multiple comorbidities, septic shock, blood transfusion, acute renal failure and the duration of time from hospital admission to surgery. Postoperative morbidity and mortality rates for ischemic colitis remain significantly high. Identification of risk factors may help patient selection for surgical interventions, and make informed decisions with patients and family members.

The purpose of this study was to determine the percent of EGS patients with CHA (as indicated by elevated %dCDT), and the relationship between %dCDT and AUDIT. Secondary aims included comparing the characteristics of EGS patients with and without CHA use, and evaluating the association of CHA use with negative clinical outcomes. EGS patients aged 21 and older admitted to the general surgery inpatient service of a tertiary hospital from July 2014 to June 2016 were invited to participate in this study. %dCDT levels above 1.7% were considered positive for CHA use, as were AUDIT scores ≥8. 195 EGS patients were screened for inclusion and 91 (46.7%) agreed to participate. 14 (15.4%) were positive for hazardous alcohol use on AUDIT and 5 (5.5%) were positive for CHA by %dCDT. Positive predictive value of AUDIT for CHA was 21.4%. There was no correlation between positive scores on AUDIT and %dCDT. Identifying at risk patients early on in their hospital course may allow clinicians to institute treatments to mitigate and/or circumvent complications in such patients. This pilot study determined that 17.6% of participating EGS patients were positive for some type of alcohol misuse, but only 5.5% had CHA.

Transfer from outside institution delays effective control of ongoing infection and has been linked with worse outcomes. Previous research suggests transfer status negatively impacts survival but has not examined the effect of location and type of institution prior to transfer. This study aims to characterize the effect of type of transferring institution on postoperative outcomes after emergency colon surgery. Data originated from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from 2010 to 2012. Patients undergoing emergent colectomy were stratified based on location: not transferred, transferred from outside emergency department (ED), transferred from outside hospital inpatient unit, or transferred from a nursing home. Patient variables were stratified and compared via χ and analysis of variance. A backward-multivariable logistic regression and adjusted multivariate Cox regression analysis were performed to determine factors predicting 30-day mortality. A total of 14,245 patients were identified, of whom 22% (3,203) were transfer patients. Among transfers, 48% (1,531) came from outside hospital inpatient units. Thirty-day mortality varied significantly (p < 0.001) among transfer location: 12.8% when not transferred, 19.4% from outside EDs, 25.7% from outside hospital inpatient units, and 34.2% from nursing homes. Hazard ratios were 1.30 (p < 0.001) after transfer from outside hospital inpatient ward and 1.50 (p < 0.001) after transfer from nursing home. Patients transferred from nursing homes were more likely to have septic shock (26.9% vs. 11.6%, p < 0.001) and longer hospitalizations (13 days vs. 10 days, p < 0.001) versus those not transferred. Transfer status is an independent contributor to death in emergency general surgery patients undergoing colectomy. Patients transferred from an outside hospital ED, nursing home or chronic care facility have the poorest outcomes. These results reinforce the importance of rapid triage and transfer of patients with early physiologic decompensation to ensure timely surgical evaluation and intervention.

Despite calls to action by national trauma coalitions, there are few published reports of prospective interventions. The objective of this quality improvement project was to first develop a frailty screening program, and, then, if frail, implement a novel frailty pathway to reduce LOS, 30-day readmissions, and loss of independence. This was a before-after study of a prospective cohort of all geriatric (≥65-years-old) patients admitted to the TEGS service from October 2016 to October 2017. All patients were screened for frailty for 3 months (preintervention) to obtain baseline outcomes. Subsequently, frail patients were entered into our frailty pathway (postintervention). Nonparametric statistical tests were used to assess significant differences in continuous variables; χ and Fisher exact tests were used for categorical variables, where appropriate. Both process and outcome measures were evaluated. Of 239 geriatric TEGS patients screened, 70 (29.3%) were frail. All TEGS geriatric patients were screened within 24 hours of admission. Following frailty pathway implementation, median LOS for frail patients decreased from 9 to 6 days (p = 0.4), readmissions decreased from 36.4% to 10.2% (p = 0.04), and loss of independence decreased by 40%, (100% vs 60%; p = 0.01). Outcomes for nonfrail geriatric patients did not differ between cohorts. Screening for frailty followed by implementing a frailty pathway decreased LOS, loss of independence, and 30-day readmission rates for frail geriatric TEGS patients at a single urban academic institution. The pathway required no additional resources; rather, we shifted focus toward frail patients without negatively affecting outcomes in nonfrail geriatric TEGS patients. Implementation of this pathway with larger patient cohorts and in varied settings is needed to confirm a causal relationship between our intervention and improved outcomes.

    "abstract": "Patients undergoing Emergency General Surgery (EGS) have increased risk of complications and death. The risk of AKI in patients undergoing EGS, along with associated outcomes, is unknown. This two-institution observational study included adults admitted to intensive care units between 1997 and 2012. EGS was defined by 7 procedures occurring within 48 hours of ICU admission. The main outcome studied was AKI within 5 days, along with 90-day mortality. In our cohort of 59,604 patients, 1758 (2.9%) underwent EGS. Risk of AKI in EGD patients was significantly increased relative to non-EGS patients, with adjusted odds of 1.7 (95%CI 1.40-1.94; P < 0.001). Risk of renal replacement for EGS patients was also increased, with odds of 1.8 (95%CI 1.37-2.46; P < 0.001). EGS patients were at significantly higher risk of 90-day mortality, with adjusted odds of 3.1 (95%CI 2.16-4.33,p < 0.001) for AKI and 4.5 (95%CI 2.58-7.96,p < 0.001) for AKI requiring renal replacement, relative to the absence of AKI. EGS is a robust risk factor for AKI in critically ill patients, the development of which is strongly predictive of increased 90-day mortality."

    "title": "Adherence to 20 Emergency General Surgery Best Practices: Results of a National Survey.",
    "abstract": "To examine national adherence to emergency general surgery (EGS) best practices. There is a national crisis in access to high-quality care for general surgery emergencies. Acute care surgery (ACS), a specialty leveraging strengths of trauma systems, may ameliorate this crisis. A critical component of trauma care is adherence to clinical guidelines. We previously established best practices for EGS using RAND Appropriateness Methodology and pilot data. A hybrid (postal/electronic) questionnaire measuring adherence to 20 EGS best practices was administered to respondents overseeing EGS at all eligible adult acute care general hospitals across the US (N = 2811). Questionnaire responses were analyzed using bivariate methods and multiple logistic regression. The response rate was 60.1%. Adherence ranged from 8.5% for having an EGS registry to 86.2% for auditing 30-day postoperative readmissions. Adherence was higher for practices not restricted to EGS (eg, auditing readmissions) compared to EGS-specific practices (eg, registry, activation system). Adopting an ACS model of care increased adherence to practices for deferring elective cases; tiering urgent operations; following National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines; reversing anticoagulants; auditing returns to intensive care, time to evaluation, time to operation, and time to source control; and having transfer agreements to receive patients, ICU admission protocols, as well as EGS-specific activation systems, outpatient clinics, morbidity and mortality conferences, and registries. There is substantial room for performance improvement, and adopting an ACS model predicts better performance. This novel overview of adherence to EGS best practices will enable surgeons and policymakers to address variations in EGS care nationally."

    "abstract": "The 2013 Tokyo Guidelines (TG13) are used to diagnose, grade severity, and guide management of acute cholecystitis (AC). The aim of our study was to verify the diagnostic criteria, severity assessment, and management protocols based on the TG13. Our prospectively maintained emergency general surgery registry was used to review patients who had a surgical consultation for right upper quadrant pain (from 2013 to 2015). Diagnosis and severity were graded based on TG13 and compared with pathology reports. Our institutional management protocols were compared with TG13. Nine hundred and fifty-two patients were analyzed, of which 857 had biliary diseases. Mean age was 42 ± 18 years and 67% were female. Seven hundred and seventy-nine had a cholecystectomy, 15 underwent cholecystostomy tube placement, and 63 patients were managed conservatively. Only 4% were febrile on presentation and 51% of patients had leukocytosis. Fifty-nine percent of patients did not have any signs of AC on ultrasonography. The TG13 criteria had a sensitivity of 53% for diagnosing AC (definitive 27%, suspected 26%, and undiagnosed 47%) when compared with the final pathology report; 92.5% of patients with grade I, 93% with grade II, and even 64% with grade III, underwent cholecystectomy safely at our institute. There were no differences in complication rates (3.7% vs 4.7%; p = 0.81), return to operating room rates (0.6% vs 0.7%; p = 0.95), or mortality rates (0.3% vs 0%; p = 0.96) between grade I and grade II patients who underwent early cholecystectomy. The TG13 diagnostic criteria lack sensitivity and missed more than half of the patients with AC, as many patients lack clinical signs (fever and leukocytosis). The TG13 recommendations for conservative management and delayed cholecystectomy in grade II and grade III disease are not warranted."

We aimed to test the diagnostic accuracy of two established methods to reliably diagnose VAP in acutely ill and injured surgical patients. After institutional review board approval, we prospectively collected data on 508 mechanically ventilated acute care surgery patients. Microbiologic samples were taken daily from all patients. Demographics, clinical, laboratory, and radiographic data were collected. The Johanson Criteria (JC) and Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) were calculated and analyzed. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated in comparison to positive respiratory cultures. Of the 508 patients, 312 (61.4%) were acutely injured; emergent general surgery was performed in 141 (27.8%) patients, and 54 (10.6%) underwent elective operation. Positive respiratory cultures were identified in 198 (39%) of the 508 patients. JC diagnosed VAP in 291 (57.3%) patients (sensitivity 82.8%, specificity 59%, PPV 56.4%, NPV 84.3%, accuracy 68.3%). The CPIS resulted in 189 (37.2%) VAP diagnoses (sensitivity 61.1%, specificity 78.1%, PPV 64%, NPV 75.9%, and accuracy 71.5%). To address the inaccuracy of the algorithms, concordance testing was performed on the data to evaluate correlation between the algorithmic VAP diagnosis criteria and respiratory culture data. Nonconcordance with culture data diagnosis was identified with both JC (rho 0.41) and CPIS (rho 0.41). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV, and accuracy of both established clinical formulas was unacceptably low in acute care surgery patients."

An analysis of the American College of Surgeons NSQIP database from 2013 and 2014 of patients undergoing 10 common EGS operations in an emergent fashion. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to determine factors that predicted VTE after discharge. A total of 130,036 patients were included. The 30-day VTE rate was 1.30%, with 35% of all VTEs occurring after discharge. Of those who had VTE develop after discharge, 69.4% required readmission. Predictive factors for post-discharge VTE included prolonged length of stay (odds ratio [OR] 5.25; p < 0.001), presence of metastatic cancer (OR 2.23; p < 0.001), urinary tract infection (OR 1.91; p < 0.001), and postoperative sepsis (OR 1.55; p < 0.001). Identified high-risk groups had a rate of readmission with thrombus 6 times greater than that of average-risk EGS patients. More than 30% of VTEs in the EGS population occur after discharge; of these, a vast majority require readmission. Select high-risk EGS subgroups might benefit from prophylactic anticoagulation at discharge."

    "abstract": "Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the most preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in US hospitals, and approximately 2.5% of emergency general surgery (EGS) patients will be diagnosed with a VTE event. Emergency general surgery patients are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality because of the nature of acute surgical conditions and the challenges related to prophylaxis. MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Collected Reviews were searched from January 1, 1990, through December 31, 2015. Nearly all operatively and nonoperatively treated EGS patients have a moderate to high risk of developing a VTE, and individual risk should be assessed at admission. Pharmacologic prophylaxis in the form of unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin should be considered unless an absolute contraindication, such as bleeding, exists. Patients should receive the first dose at admission to the hospital, and administration should continue until discharge without missed doses. Certain patient populations, such as those with malignant tumors, may benefit from prolonged VTE prophylaxis after discharge. Mechanical prophylaxis should be considered in all patients, particularly if pharmacologic prophylaxis is contraindicated. Studies that specifically target improved adherence with VTE prophylaxis in EGS patients suggest that efficacy and quality improvement initiatives should be undertaken from a system and institutional perspective. Operatively and nonoperatively treated EGS patients are at a comparatively high risk of VTE. Despite gaps in existing literature with respect to this increasing patient population, successful best practices can be applied. Best practices include assessment of VTE risk, optimal prophylaxis, and physician, nurse, and patient education regarding the use of mechanical and pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis and institutional policies."

    "abstract": "Threatened, perforated, and infarcted bowel is managed with conventional resection and anastomosis (hand sewn [HS] or stapled [ST]). The SHAPES analysis demonstrated equivalence between HS and ST techniques, yet surgeons appeared to prefer HS for the critically ill. We hypothesized that HS is more frequent in patients with higher disease severity as measured by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Emergency General Surgery (AAST EGS) grading system. We performed a post hoc analysis of the SHAPES database. Operative reports were submitted by volunteering SHAPES centers. Final AAST grade was compared with various outcomes including duration of stay, physiologic/laboratory data, anastomosis type, anastomosis failure (dehiscence, abscess, or fistula), and mortality. A total of 391 patients were reviewed, with a mean age (±SD) of 61.2 ± 16.8 years, 47% women. Disease severity distribution was as follows: grade I (n = 0, 0%), grade II (n = 106, 27%), grade III (n = 113, 29%), grade IV (n = 123, 31%), and grade V (n = 49, 13%). Increasing AAST grade was associated with acidosis and hypothermia. There was an association between higher AAST grade and likelihood of HS anastomosis. On regression, factors associated with mortality included development of anastomosis complication and vasopressor use but not increasing AAST EGS grade or anastomotic technique. This is the first study to use standardized anatomic injury grades for patients undergoing urgent/emergent bowel resection in EGS. Higher AAST severity scores are associated with key clinical outcomes in EGS diseases requiring bowel resection and anastomosis. Anastomotic-specific complications were not associated with higher AAST grade; however, mortality was influenced by anastomosis complication and vasopressor use. Future EGS studies should routinely include AAST grading as a method for reliable comparison of injury between groups. Prognostic, level III."

The severe form of acute cholecystitis should include both gangrenous and phlegmonous cholecystitis, due to their severe clinical course, and cholecystectomy should not be delayed. The aim of this study was to create a nomogram to obtain a graphical tool to compute the probability of having a severe acute cholecystitis. This is a retrospective study on 393 patients who underwent emergency cholecystectomy between January 2010 and December 2015 at the Acute Care Surgery Service of the S. Anna University Hospital of Ferrara, Italy. Patients were classified as having a non-severe acute cholecystitis or a severe acute cholecystitis (i.e., gangrenous and phlegmonous) based on the final pathology report. The baseline characteristics, pre-operative signs, and abdominal ultrasound (US) findings were assessed with a stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis to predict the risk of severe acute cholecystitis, and a nomogram was created. Age as a continuous variable, WBC count ≥ 12.4 × 103/μl, CRP ≥9.9 mg/dl, and presence of US thickening of the gallbladder wall were significantly associated with severe acute cholecystitis at final pathology report. A significant interaction between the effect of age and CRP was found. Four risk classes were identified based on the nomogram total points. Patients with a nomogram total point ≥ 74 should be considered at high risk of severe acute cholecystitis (at 74 total point, sensitivity = 78.5%; specificity = 78.2%; accuracy = 78.3%) and this finding could be useful for surgical planning once confirmed in a prospective study comparing the risk score stratification and clinical outcomes."

    "abstract": "Postoperative prescribing following acute care surgery must be optimized to limit excess opioids in circulation as misuse and diversion are frequently preceded by a prescription for acute pain. This study aimed to identify patient characteristics associated with higher opioid prescribing following laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Among patients aged 18 years or older who underwent LC at a single institution in 2014 to 2016, opioids prescribed at discharge were converted to oral morphine equivalents (OME) and compared with developing state guidelines (maximum, 200 OME). Preoperative opioid use was defined as any opioid prescription 1 month to 3 months before LC or a prescription unrelated to gallbladder disease less than 1 month before LC. Univariate and multivariable methods determined characteristics associated with top quartile opioid prescriptions among opioid-naive patients. Of 1,606 LC patients, 34% had emergent procedures, and 14% were preoperative opioid users. Nonemergent LC patients were more likely to use opioids preoperatively (16% vs. 11%, p = 0.006), but median OME did not differ by preoperative opioid use (225 vs. 219, p = 0.40). Among 1,376 opioid-naive patients, 96% received opioids at discharge. Median OME was 225 (interquartile range, 150-300), and 52% were prescribed greater than 200 OME. Top quartile prescriptions (≥300 OME) were associated with gallstone pancreatitis diagnosis, younger age, higher pain scores, and longer length of stay (all p < 0.05). While median OME did not differ by emergent status (median, 225; interquartile range, 150-300 for both, p = 0.15), emergent had more top quartile prescriptions (32% vs. 25%, p = 0.005). After adjusting for diagnosis, age, and sex, emergent status showed evidence of being associated with top quartile prescription (odds ratio, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.8). Thirty-day refill rate was 5%. Over half of opioid-naive patients undergoing LC were prescribed opioids exceeding draft state guidelines. Variation in prescribing patterns was not fully explained by patient factors.

The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma's Aortic Occlusion in Resuscitation for Trauma and Acute Care Surgery registry identified trauma patients without penetrating thoracic injury undergoing aortic occlusion at the level of the descending thoracic aorta (resuscitative thoracotomy [RT] or zone 1 resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta [REBOA]) in the emergency department (ED). Survival outcomes relative to the timing of CPR need and admission hemodynamic status were examined. Two hundred and eighty-five patients were included: 81.8% were males, with injury due to penetrating mechanisms in 41.4%; median age was 35.0 years (interquartile range 29 years) and median Injury Severity Score was 34.0 (interquartile range 18). Resuscitative thoracotomy was used in 71%, and zone 1 REBOA in 29%. Overall survival beyond the ED was 50% (RT 44%, REBOA 63%; p = 0.004) and survival to discharge was 5% (RT 2.5%, REBOA 9.6%; p = 0.023). Discharge Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15 in 85% of survivors. Prehospital CPR was required in 60% of patients with a survival beyond the ED of 37% and survival to discharge of 3% (all p > 0.05). Patients who did not require any CPR before had a survival beyond the ED of 70% (RT 48%, REBOA 93%; p < 0.001) and survival to discharge of 13% (RT 3.4%, REBOA 22.2%, p = 0.048). If aortic occlusion patients did not require CPR but presented with hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg; 9% [65% RT; 35% REBOA]), they achieved survival beyond the ED in 65% (p = 0.009) and survival to discharge of 15% (RT 0%, REBOA 44%; p = 0.008). Overall, REBOA can confer a survival benefit over RT, particularly in patients not requiring CPR.

To examine the role of FTR among emergency general surgery, we compared nationwide risk-adjusted mortality, complications, and FTR rates after emergent bowel resections. We identified patients who underwent emergent small or large bowel resections in the 2010 to 2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample using the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma criteria. We then calculated risk-adjusted mortality rates for each hospital using multivariable logistic regressions and postestimation, which adjusted for patient age, sex, race and ethnicity, payer status, comorbidities, and hospital clustering. After excluding hospitals with fewer than 10 resections per year, we ranked the remaining hospitals by their risk-adjusted mortality rates and divided them into five quintiles. We compared both risk-adjusted complication rates and FTR rates between the top (lowest mortality) and bottom (highest mortality) quintiles. We identified 21,564 emergent bowel resections, weighted to 105,925 procedures nationwide. The bottom quintile of hospitals had an overall risk-adjusted mortality rate that was 10.9 times higher than that of the top quintile of hospitals (15.3% vs. 1.4%). While risk-adjusted complication rates were similarly high for both the bottom and the top quintiles of hospitals (22.5% vs. 15.7%), the risk-adjusted FTR rates were 10.8 times higher in the bottom quintile of hospitals relative to the top quintile of hospitals (33.4% vs. 3.1%). Using larger hospital volume thresholds yielded similar findings. Furthermore, large variations existed in complication-specific FTR rates (surgical site infection [6.6%] to myocardial infarction [29.4%]). Nationwide hospital variation in risk-adjusted mortality rates exist after emergent bowel resections. As complication rates were similar across hospitals, the significantly higher FTR rates at higher-mortality hospitals may drive this variation in mortality.

We aimed to determine the time to operative intervention in coagulopathic emergency general surgery patients receiving either PCC or FFP. We hypothesize that PCC administration more rapidly normalizes coagulopathy and that the time to operation is diminished compared to FFP alone. Single institution retrospective review was performed for coagulopathic EGS patients during 2/1/2008 to 8/1/2016. Patients were divided into three groups (1) PCC alone (2) FFP alone and (3) PCC and FFP. The primary outcome was the duration from clinical decision to operate to the time of incision. Summary and univariate analyses were performed. Coagulopathic EGS patients (n = 183) received the following blood products: PCC (n = 20, 11%), FFP alone (n = 119, 65%) and PCC/FFP (n = 44, 24%).

While operating on 16.5% of all geriatric-EGS patients, low-volume surgeons had higher risk-adjusted adverse outcomes: mortality (7.0% vs. 4.0%, p = 0.005), in-hospital complications (22.1% vs. 19.7%, p = 0.13), failure-to-rescue (17.3% vs. 12.1%, p = 0.021), and 30-day readmissions (11.2% vs. 10.0%, p = 0.55). After adjustment, low-volume surgeons were associated with higher mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.86, 95% CI [1.21-2.86]) and failure-to-rescue rates (aOR 1.74 [1.09-2.80]) but not in-hospital complications (aOR 1.20 [0.95-1.51]) or 30-day readmissions (aOR 1.07 [0.85-1.34]). In contrast, low-volume hospitals relative to high-volume hospitals, and hospitals serving lower proportions of geriatric-EGS patients, were not associated with adverse outcomes. Relative to their higher-volume counterparts, surgeons performing eight or fewer geriatric-EGS procedures annually were associated with an 86% higher odds of death and 74% higher odds of failure-to-rescue in this elderly EGS patient population. These findings underscore the need for focused care of elderly surgical patients. Prognostic and epidemiological, level IV."

    "abstract": "Lack of insurance coverage increases complications and mortality from surgical procedures. The 2014 Affordable Care Act (ACA) Open Enrollment (OE) insured more Americans, but it is unknown if this improved outcomes from emergency general surgery (EGS) procedures. This study seeks to determine how ACA OE coverage changes outcomes in EGS. This is a retrospective review using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database from 2012 to 2014. Patients aged 18 to 64 years undergoing EGS procedures were identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes. Medicare patients were excluded. Patient demographics, hospital characteristics, and Charlson comorbidity index were obtained. Outcomes were measured by mortality, complications, and calculated costs. Univariate and difference-in-differences multivariate analyses were performed to determine the effect of the ACA OE on EGS outcomes. A total of 304,110 EGS cases were identified. After Medicare patients were excluded, there were 275,425 cases. In 2014, Medicaid admissions increased 18.2% from 18,495 to 22,615 (p < 0.001) and self-pay admissions decreased 33% from 14,938 to 10,630 (p < 0.001). Mortality significantly increased for self-pay patients in 2014 from 0.81% to 1.22% (p < 0.001). Difference-in-differences analysis indicated that, after risk adjustment, the ACA OE was associated with a small reduction in mortality for insured patients (-0.12%, p = 0.034), increased complications (1.4%, p = 0.009), and increased wage-index adjusted mean costs (4.6%, p < 0.001). There was a significant increase in Medicare (+26.5%) and private (+12.2%, p < 0.001) insurance admissions in teaching hospitals, while nonteaching hospitals had fewer EGS admissions with a greater reduction in uninsured EGS admissions. The ACA OE created a significant reduction in uninsured EGS admissions but did not reduce EGS mortality. Mortality decreased in insured patients but increased in uninsured patients, indicating that the ACA OE primarily insured lower-risk patients. The ACA OE did increase cost and complications in insured admissions. Teaching hospitals saw the majority of the increase in Medicaid and private insurance EGS admissions. A national registry would improve future study of insurance policy on EGS outcomes. Economic analysis, level IV."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery conditions are often thought of as being too acute for the development of standardized approaches to quality improvement. However, process mapping, a concept that has been applied extensively in manufacturing quality improvement, is now being used in health care. The objective of this study was to create process maps for small bowel obstruction in an effort to identify potential areas for quality improvement. We used the American College of Surgeons Emergency General Surgery Quality Improvement Program pilot database to identify patients who received nonoperative or operative management of small bowel obstruction between March 2015 and March 2016. This database, patient charts and electronic health records were used to create process maps from the time of presentation to discharge. Eighty-eight patients with small bowel obstruction (33 operative; 55 nonoperative) were identified. Patients who received surgery had a complication rate of 32%. The processes of care from the time of presentation to the time of follow-up were highly elaborate and variable in terms of duration; however, the sequences of care were found to be consistent. We used data visualization strategies to identify bottlenecks in care, and they showed substantial variability in terms of operating room access. Variability in the operative care of small bowel obstruction is high and represents an important improvement opportunity in general surgery. Process mapping can identify common themes, even in acute care, and suggest specific performance improvement measures. Les conditions dans lesquelles s'effectuent les interventions chirurgicales d'urgence sont souvent jugées trop pressantes pour que l'on puisse mettre au point des approches normalisées d'amélioration de la qualité. Malgré tout, la schématisation des processus, un concept largement appliqué à l'amélioration de la qualité en milieu manufacturier, est maintenant appliquée en santé. L'objectif de cette étude était de schématiser les processus suivis dans les cas d'obstruction du grêle afin de déterminer les aspects dont la qualité pourrait être améliorée. À partir de la base de données pilote du programme d'amélioration de la qualité des chirurgies générales d'urgence de l'American College of Surgeons, nous avons recensé les patients ayant reçu un traitement chirurgical ou non chirurgical pour une obstruction du grêle entre mars 2015 et mars 2016. Nous avons aussi utilisé cette base de données, de même que les dossiers des patients et les dossiers médicaux électroniques, pour schématiser les processus suivis de l'arrivée à l'hôpital jusqu'au congé. Nous avons recensé 88 patients atteints d'une obstruction du grêle (33 soumis à une chirurgie, et 55 à un traitement non chirurgical). Les patients opérés ont présenté un taux de complications de 32 %. Les processus thérapeutiques de l'arrivée au suivi se sont avérés très détaillés et variables en durée; par contre, la séquence de soins était uniforme. Nous avons utilisé des stratégies de visualisation des données pour repérer les goulots d'étranglement au chapitre des soins, ce qui a révélé une variabilité substantielle dans l'accès au bloc opératoire. La variabilité observée dans les soins chirurgicaux pour l'obstruction du grêle est élevée et représente une importante occasion d'amélioration en chirurgie générale. La schématisation des processus permet de dégager des thèmes communs, même dans un contexte d'urgence, et met en lumière des possibilités précises d'amélioration du rendement."

    "abstract": "As reimbursement models evolve, there is increasing emphasis on maximizing value-based care for inpatient conditions. We hypothesized that longer intervals between admission and surgery would be associated with worse outcomes and increased costs for acute care surgery patients, and that these associations would be strongest among patients with high-risk conditions. We performed a 5-year retrospective analysis of three risk cohorts: appendectomy (low-risk for morbidity and mortality, n = 618), urgent hernia repair (intermediate-risk, n = 80), and laparotomy for intra-abdominal sepsis with temporary abdominal closure (sTAC; high-risk, n = 102). Associations between the interval from admission to surgery and outcomes including infectious complications, mortality, length of stay, and hospital charges were assessed by regression modeling. Median intervals between admission and surgery for appendectomy, hernia repair, and sTAC were 9.3, 13.5, and 8.1 h, respectively, and did not significantly impact infectious complications or mortality. For appendectomy, each 1 h increase from admission to surgery was associated with increased hospital LOS by 1.1 h (p = 0.002) and increased intensive care unit (ICU) LOS by 0.3 h (p = 0.011). For hernia repair, each 1 h increase from admission to surgery was associated with increased antibiotic duration by 1.6 h (p = 0.007), increased hospital LOS by 3.3 h (p = 0.002), increased ICU LOS by 1.5 h (p = 0.001), and increased hospital charges by $1918 (p < 0.001). For sTAC, each 1 h increase from admission to surgery was associated with increased antibiotic duration by 5.0 h (p = 0.006), increased hospital LOS by 3.9 h (p = 0.046), increased ICU LOS by 3.5 h (p = 0.040), and increased hospital charges by $3919 (p = 0.002). Longer intervals from admission to surgery were associated with prolonged antibiotic administration, longer hospital and ICU length of stay, and increased hospital charges, with strongest effects among high-risk patients. To improve value of care for acute care surgery patients, operations should proceed as soon as resuscitation is complete."

    "abstract": "Preoperative exposure to narcotics has recently been associated with poor outcomes after elective major surgery, but little is known as to how preoperative opioid use impacts outcomes after common, emergency general surgical procedures (EGS). A high-volume, single-center analysis was performed on patients who underwent EGS from 2012 to 2013. EGS was defined as the seven emergent operations that account for 80% of the national burden. Preoperative opioid use was defined as having an active opioid prescription within 7 days prior to surgery. Chronic opioid use was defined as having an opioid prescription concurrent with 90 days after discharge. A total of 377 patients underwent EGS during the study period. Preoperative opioid use was present in 84 patients (22.3%). Preoperative opioid users had longer hospital LOS (10.5 vs 6 days), higher costs of care ($25,331 vs $11,454), and higher 30-day readmission rates (22.6 vs 8.2%) compared with opioid-naïve patients (p < 0.001 each). After covariate adjustment, preoperative opioid use was predictive of LOS (RR 1.19 [1.01-1.41]) and 30-day hospital readmission (OR 2.69 [1.25-5.75]) (p < 0.05 each). Total direct cost was not different after modeling. Preoperative opioid users required more narcotic refills compared with opioid-naïve patients (5 vs 0 refills, p < 0.001). After discharge, 15.4% of opioid-naïve patients met criteria for chronic opioid use, vs 77.4% in preoperative opioid users (p < 0.001). Preoperative opioid use is associated with greater resource utilization after emergency general surgery, as well as vastly different postoperative opioid prescription patterns. These findings may help to inform the impact of preoperative opioid use on patient care, and its implications on hospital and societal cost."

    "abstract": "The AAST recently developed an emergency general surgery (EGS) disease grading system to measure anatomic severity. We aimed to validate this grading system for acute pancreatitis and compare cross sectional imaging-based AAST EGS grade and compare with several clinical prediction models. We hypothesize that increased AAST EGS grade would be associated with important physiological and clinical outcomes and is comparable to other severity grading methods. Single institution retrospective review of adult patients admitted with acute pancreatitis during 10/2014-1/2016 was performed. Patients without imaging were excluded. Imaging, operative, and pathological AAST grades were assigned by two reviewers. Summary and univariate analyses were performed. AUROC analysis was performed comparing AAST EGS grade with other severity scoring systems. There were 297 patients with a mean (±SD) age of 55 ± 17 years; 60% were male. Gallstone pancreatitis was the most common etiology (28%). The overall complication, mortality, and ICU admission rates were 51, 1.3, and 25%, respectively. The AAST EGS imaging grade was comparable to other severity scoring systems that required multifactorial data for readmission, mortality, and length of stay. The AAST EGS grade for acute pancreatitis demonstrates initial validity; patients with increasing AAST EGS grade demonstrated longer hospital and ICU stays, and increased rates of readmission. AAST EGS grades assigned using cross sectional imaging findings were comparable to other severity scoring systems. Further studies should determine the generalizability of the AAST system.

A meta-analysis was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Embase and Scopus for published studies comparing ASU and traditional (TRAD) model on appendectomy outcomes was performed. Random-effects methods were used to analyze key outcomes with data presented as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Fourteen comparative studies describing outcomes in 7980 patients were identified, 4258 patients were included in the ASU model (53.4%). ASU model had a shorter time to theatre (WMD: -0.40, 95% CI: -0.65 to 0.15, p: 0.002), length of hospital stay (WMD: -0.25, 95% CI: -0.46 to -0.05, p: 0.02) and complication rate (OR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.99, p: 0.04) for appendectomy patients.

    "abstract": "In recent years, significant workload, high acuity, and complexity of emergency general surgery conditions have led hospitals to replace the traditional on-call model with dedicated acute care surgery (ACS) service models. A systematic search of Ovid, EMBASE, and MEDLINE was undertaken to examine the impact of ACS services on health-care delivery processes and cost, education, and provider satisfaction. From 1827 papers, reviewers identified 22 studies that met inclusion criteria and subsequently used The Evidence-Based Practice for Improving Quality method and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to score quality and level of evidence. Most studies found an increase in daytime operating, improved patient transit from emergency department to operating room to home, and decreased length of stay. Higher and more diverse case volumes improved resident education and operative experience. ACS services enhanced the educational experience of residents on subspecialty services by offloading emergency work from those services. Finally, surgeons generally felt that ACS services improved job satisfaction, productivity, and billing. The ACS model has demonstrated improvement in timeliness of care, diversified case mix, decreased costs, improved trainee learning, and increased surgeon job satisfaction."

This study assesses patients transferred to an acute care surgery service. The ER and transfer center logs, as well as billing data, were reviewed for 12 months for all cases evaluated by acute care surgery. The charts were reviewed for demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes. A total of 111 transferred patients with complete data were identified, with 59 transferred from another hospital and 52 from a free-standing ER. The hospital transfer patients were older with more comorbidities, had a longer length of stay, and were more likely discharged to skilled care. There was no difference in the percent of patients requiring a procedure; however, significantly more procedures in the hospital transfer group were done by nonsurgical specialties Better infrastructure to monitor the impact of hospital transfers is warranted in the setting of the complex patient population transferred to tertiary hospitals."

Emergency general surgery is characterized by a high-cost burden and disproportionate morbidity and mortality. Factors contributing to these observed disparities are not comprehensively understood and targets for quality improvement have not been formally developed. Using a grounded theory approach, emergency general surgery providers were recruited through purposive-criterion-based sampling to participate in semi-structured interviews and focus groups. Participants were asked to identify contributors to emergency general surgery outcomes, to define effective care for EGS patients, and to describe operating room team structure. Interviews were performed to thematic saturation. Transcripts were iteratively coded and analyzed within and across cases to identify emergent themes. Member checking was performed to establish credibility of the findings. A total of 40 participants from 5 academic hospitals participated in either individual interviews (n = 25 [9 anesthesia, 12 surgery, 4 nursing]) or focus groups (n = 2 [15 nursing]). Emergency general surgery was characterized by an exceptionally high level of variability, which can be subcategorized as patient-variability (acute physiology and comorbidities) and system-variability (operating room resources and workforce). Multidisciplinary communication is identified as a modifier to variability in emergency general surgery; however, nursing is often left out of early communication exchanges. Critical variability in emergency general surgery may impact outcomes. Patient-variability and system-variability, with focus on multidisciplinary communication, represent potential domains for quality improvement in this field."

The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) developed an anatomically based severity grading system for surgical diseases, including cholecystitis. Because the Tokyo Guidelines represent the gold standard to estimate acute cholecystitis severity, we wished to validate the AAST emergency general surgery scoring system and compare the performance of both systems for several patient outcomes. Adults (≥18 years) with acute cholecystitis during 2013-2016 were identified. Baseline demographic characteristics, comorbidity severity as defined by Charlson Comorbidity Index score, procedure types, and AAST and Tokyo Guidelines 2013 grades were abstracted. Outcomes included duration of stay, 30-day mortality, and complications. Comparison of the Tokyo Guidelines and AAST grading system was performed using receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve C statistics. There were 443 patients, with a mean (±standard deviation) age of 64.8 (±18) years, 59% male. The median (interquartile ratio) Charlson Comorbidity score was 3 (0-6). Management included laparoscopic (n = 307, 69.3%), open (n = 26, 6%), laparoscopy converted to laparotomy (n = 53, 12%), and cholecystostomy (n = 57, 12.7%). Comparison of AAST with Tokyo Guidelines AUROC C statistics indicated (P < .05) mortality (0.86 vs 0.73), complication (0.76 vs 0.63), and cholecystostomy tube utilization (0.80 vs 0.68). Emergency general surgery grading systems improve disease severity assessment, may improve documentation, and guide management. Discrimination of disease severity using the AAST grading system outperforms the Tokyo Guidelines for key clinical outcomes. The AAST grading system requires prospective validation and further comparison."

The present study was designed to examine contemporary RT utilization and outcomes compared with historical data (n = 10,238) from the EAST PMG review from published series 1974 to 2013. The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Aortic Occlusion for Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (AORTA) registry was utilized to identify patients undergoing RT in the emergency department (ED) from November 2013 to December 2016. Demographics, injury data, physiologic presentation, and outcomes were reviewed and compared with those of the EAST PMG review. Three-hundred ten RT patients from 16 contributing AORTA centers were identified. The majority were injured by penetrating mechanisms (197/310, 64% [gunshot (163/197, 83%)]). Signs of life (SOL) (organized electrical activity, pupillary response, spontaneous movement, or appreciable pulse/blood pressure) were present on arrival in 47% (147/310). When compared with the EAST PMG results, there was no difference in either hospital survival (5% vs. 8%) or neurologically intact survival between historical controls or AORTA registry patients in any category combination of mechanism/anatomic location/presenting signs of life. Blunt injuries W/O SOL on admission continue to constitute 14% (45/310) of RTs in the ED, without documented survivors. Comparison of historical RT controls to more contemporary patients from the AORTA registry suggests that practices and outcomes following RT have not changed. Despite a wealth of accumulated data over several decades, RT continues to be performed for patients after blunt mechanisms of injury who present W/O SOL despite lack of demonstrated hope for survival benefit."

An observational study was performed using the National Inpatient Sample in 2012-2013; the largest all-payer inpatient database in the United States, which represents a 20% stratified sample of hospital discharges. The inclusion criteria were all inpatients with a primary EGS diagnosis. Outcomes were SAE, in-hospital mortality, and FTR (in-hospital mortality in the population of patients that developed an SAE). Multivariable logistic regression were used to adjust for patient- (age, sex, race, payer status, and Charlson comorbidity index) and hospital-level (trauma designation and hospital bed size) characteristics. There were 1,344,828 individual patient records (6.7 million weighted admissions). The overall rate of SAE was 15.1% (15.1% weekend, 14.9% weekday, P < 0.001), FTR 5.9% (6.2% weekend, 5.9% weekday, P = 0.010), and in-hospital mortality 1.4% (1.5% weekend, 1.3% weekday, P < 0.001). Within logistic regression models, weekend admission was an independent risk factor for development of SAE (adjusted odds ratio 1.08, 1.07-1.09), FTR (1.05, 1.01-1.10), and in-hospital mortality (1.14, 1.10-1.18). This study found evidence that outcomes coded in an administrative data set are marginally worse for EGS patients admitted at weekends. This justifies further work using clinical data sets that can be used to better control for differences in case mix."

Cholecystitis severity was graded based on clinical, imaging, operative, and pathologic criteria. We aimed to validate the AAST anatomic grading system for acute cholecystitis. This is a retrospective cohort study including consecutive patients admitted with acute cholecystitis at an urban, tertiary medical center between 2013 and 2016. Grade 1 is acute cholecystitis, Grade 2 is gangrenous or emphysematous cholecystitis, Grade 3 is localized perforation, and Grades 4 and 5 have regional and systemic peritonitis, respectively. Concordance between the AAST grade and outcome including mortality, length of stay (LOS), ICU use, readmission, and complications were assessed using logistic regression. A total of 315 patients were included. There was very good inter-rater (two independent raters) reliability for anatomic grading, κ = 1.00, p < 0.005. The majority of patients were Grade 1 or Grade 2 (94%). Incidence of complications, LOS, ICU use, and any adverse event increased with increasing anatomic grade. When compared to Grade 1 disease, patients with Grade 2 were more likely to undergo cholecystectomy (OR 4.07 [1.93-8.56]). Grade 3 patients were at higher risk of adverse events (OR 3.83 [1.34-10.94]), longer LOS (OR 1.73 [1.03-2.92]), and ICU use (OR 8.07 [2.43-26.80]).

With increasing focus in the healthcare literature on cost containment, controlling excess lengths of hospital stay (LOS) in this population is paramount. The aim of this study was to determine the factors that influence LOS in cholecystectomy patients to examine whether results would indicate a possible improvement in perioperative patient care and decrease costs at our community hospital in a suburban setting. This is a retrospective review during a two-year period from 1/1/2013-12/31/2014 of patients admitted from the emergency department and undergoing cholecystectomy during the same admission. The study team analyst conducted univariate analysis for significant predictors of length of stay. The authors identified a total analytic sample of 312 subjects who met inclusion criteria. Sample patients admitted to the surgical service had a statistically significant shorter LOS than those patients who were not (3.4 days +/- 1.7 vs 5.6 days +/- 3.0; p value <0.0005). There was also a moderate positive correlation between decreased time to surgery and LOS (Pearson R-value 0.420, p value < 0.0005). Patients admitted to non-surgical services were more likely to have comorbidities like COPD, DM, arrhythmia, CAD, anticoagulation, CHF and previous abdominal surgeries. However, when placing each comorbidity into an analysis of covariance, patients admitted to surgical services still had a significantly shorter LOS (p value < 0.0005). Admission to a non-surgical service and increased length of time to surgical intervention were associated with prolonged LOS and potentially increased cost in cholecystectomy patients in this study sample. Though patients admitted to non-surgical services are \"sicker,\" they still had prolonged LOS when controlling for comorbidities. Based on these findings, the establishment of an acute care surgery service may help to address this disparity in care."

The authors conducted a survey of the members of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma and the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma aimed at establishing a pilot registry of qualified trauma surgeons available to respond to disasters. Data from the surveys were analyzed retrospectively for surgical and subspecialty training, board certification, disaster response training, and military or civilian disaster experience to better understand the respondents' functional capacities and disaster training backgrounds. Of 211 respondents, 96% self-identified as trauma surgeons, whereas 87% and 89% reported active practice in acute care surgery and/or critical care. Nearly all had primary board certifications in general surgery (93%), and many had additional certifications in surgical critical care (65%). While many reported participation in American College of Surgeons-sponsored trauma courses, only 30% of those surveyed received disaster-specific training in Federal Emergency Management Agency courses, and even fewer received training in the Disaster Management and Emergency Preparedness course. Few had military (26%) or civilian (19%) experience in disaster response. This initiative complements efforts to organize a registry of trauma surgeons who are qualified and willing to respond in all aspects of disaster response. While trauma surgeons are optimally positioned to provide a wide range of surgical expertise in a disaster, this study further demonstrated the lack of a universally accepted disaster training program for surgeons willing to respond to mass casualty incidents. Standardized disaster response training for surgeons remains a challenge for the future. Care management, level IV."

Although the hospital-level traits that contribute to EGS outcomes are not well understood, we hypothesized that facilities with lower trauma mortality would have lower EGS mortality. Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2008-2011), we calculated hospital-level risk-adjusted trauma mortality rates for hospitals with more than 400 trauma admissions. We then calculated hospital-level risk-adjusted EGS mortality rates for hospitals with more than 200 urgent/emergent admissions for seven core EGS procedures (laparotomy, large bowel resection, small bowel resection, lysis of adhesions, operative intervention for ulcer disease, cholecystectomy, and appendectomy). We used univariable and multivariable techniques to assess for associations between hospital-level risk-adjusted EGS mortality and hospital characteristics, patient-mix traits, EGS volume, and trauma mortality quartile. Data from 303 hospitals, representing 153,544 admissions, revealed a median hospital-level EGS mortality rate of 1.21% (interquartile range, 0.86%-1.71%). After adjusting for hospital traits, hospital-level EGS mortality was significantly associated with trauma mortality quartile as well as patients' community income-level and race/ethnicity (p < 0.05 for all). Mean risk-adjusted EGS mortality was 1.09% (95% confidence interval, 0.94-1.25%) at hospitals in the lowest quartile for risk-adjusted trauma mortality, and 1.64% (95% confidence interval, 1.48-1.80%) at hospitals in the highest quartile of trauma mortality (p < 0.01). Sensitivity analyses limited to (1) high-mortality procedures and (2) high-volume facilities; both found similar trends (p < 0.01). Patients at hospitals with lower risk-adjusted trauma mortality have a nearly 33% lower risk of mortality after admission for EGS procedures. The structures and processes that improve trauma mortality may also improve EGS mortality. Emergency general surgery-specific systems measures and process measures are needed to better understand drivers of variation in quality of EGS outcomes.

Our study hypothesis was that there would be similar variation in risk-adjusted outcomes of emergency general surgery (EGS) patients. We undertook a retrospective analysis of the National Inpatient Sample database for 2010. Patients with EGS diseases were identified using American Association for the Surgery of Trauma definitions. A hierarchical logistic regression model was used to model in-hospital mortality, accounting for patient characteristics, including age, sex, race, ethnicity, insurance type, and comorbidities. Predicted-to-expected mortality ratios with 90% confidence intervals were used to identify hospitals as low mortality (ratio significantly lower than 1), high mortality (ratio significantly higher than 1), or average mortality (ratio overlapping 1). Nationwide, 2,640,725 patients with EGS diseases were treated at 943 hospitals in 2010. About one-sixth of the hospitals (139, 15%) were low mortality, a quarter were high mortality (221, 23%), and the rest were average mortality. Mortality ratio at low mortality hospitals was almost four times lower than that of high mortality hospitals (0.57 vs. 2.03, p < 0.0001). If high and average mortality hospitals performed at the same level as low mortality hospitals, we estimate 16,812 (55%) more deaths than expected. There are significant variations in risk-adjusted outcomes of EGS patients across hospitals, with several thousand higher than expected number of deaths nationwide. Based on the success of National Surgical Quality Improvement Program and Trauma Quality Improvement Program, we recommend establishing EGS quality improvement program for risk-adjusted benchmarking of hospitals for EGS patients.

    "abstract": "Management of emergency general surgical conditions remains a challenge in rural sub-Saharan Africa due to issues such as insufficient human capacity and infrastructure. This study describes the burden of emergency general surgical conditions and the ability to provide care for these conditions at three rural district hospitals in Rwanda. This retrospective cross-sectional study included all patients presenting to Butaro, Kirehe and Rwinkwavu District Hospitals between January 1st 2015 and December 31st 2015 with emergency general surgical conditions, defined as non-traumatic, non-obstetric acute care surgical conditions. We describe patient demographics, clinical characteristics, management and outcomes. In 2015, 356 patients presented with emergency general surgical conditions. The majority were male (57.2%) and adults aged 15-60 years (54.5%). The most common diagnostic group was soft tissue infections (71.6%), followed by acute abdominal conditions (14.3%). The median length of symptoms prior to diagnosis differed significantly by diagnosis type (p < 0.001), with the shortest being urological emergencies at 1.5 days (interquartile range (IQR):1, 6) and the longest being complicated hernia at 17.5 days (IQR: 1, 208). Of all patients, 54% were operated on at the district hospital, either by a general surgeon or general practitioner. Patients were more likely to receive surgery if they presented to a hospital with a general surgeon compared to a hospital with only general practitioners (75% vs 43%, p < 0.001). In addition, the general surgeon was more likely to treat patients with complex diagnoses such as acute abdominal conditions (33.3% vs 4.1%, p < 0.001) compared to general practitioners. For patients who received surgery, 73.3% had no postoperative complications and 3.2% died. While acute abdominal conditions are often considered the most common emergency general surgical condition in sub-Saharan Africa, soft tissue infections were the most common in our setting. This could represent a true difference in epidemiology in rural settings compared to referral facilities in urban settings. Patients were more likely to receive an operation in a hospital with a general surgeon as opposed to a general practitioner. This provides evidence to support increasing the surgical workforce in district hospitals in order to increase surgical availability for patients."

    "abstract": "Whether patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI) who presented to under-resourced hospitals are best served by immediate debridement or expedited transfer is unknown. We examined whether interhospital transfer status impacts outcomes of patients requiring emergency debridement for NSTI. We conducted a retrospective review studying patients with an operative diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis, Fournier's gangrene, or gas gangrene in the 2010-2015 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Participant Use Data Files. Multivariable regression analyses determined if transfer status independently predicted 30-d mortality, major morbidity, minor morbidity, and length of stay. Among 1801 patients, 1243 (69.0%) were in the non-transfer group and 558 (31.0%) were in the transfer group. The transfer group experienced higher rates of 30-d mortality (14.5% versus 13.0%) and major morbidity (64.5% versus 60.1%) than the non-transfer group, which were not significant after risk adjustment (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.87 [0.62-1.22] and 1.00 [0.79-1.27], respectively). The transferred group experienced a longer median length of postoperative hospitalization (14 d [interquartile range 8-24] versus 11 d [6-20]), which maintained statistical significance after adjustment for other factors (adjusted beta coefficient [95% confidence interval]: 1.92 [0.48-3.37]; P = 0.009). Our results suggest that interhospital transfer status is not an independent risk factor for mortality or morbidity after surgical management of NSTI. Although expedient debridement remains a basic tenet of NSTI management, our findings provide some reassurance that transfer before initial debridement will not significantly jeopardize patient outcomes should such transfer be deemed necessary."

    "abstract": "Our objective was to establish the safety of 3% hypertonic saline (HTS) resuscitation for trauma and acute care surgery patients undergoing emergent laparotomy and temporary abdominal closure (TAC) with the hypothesis that HTS administration would be associated with hyperosmolar hypercholoremic acidosis, lower resuscitation volumes, and higher fascial closure rates, without adversely affecting renal function. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of 189 trauma and acute care surgery patients who underwent emergent laparotomy and TAC, comparing patients with normal baseline renal function who received 3% HTS at 30 mL/h (n = 36) to patients with standard resuscitation (n = 153) by baseline characteristics, resuscitation parameters, and outcomes including primary fascial closure and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes stages of acute kidney injury. The HTS and standard resuscitation groups had similar baseline illness severity and organ dysfunction, though HTS patients had lower serum creatinine at initial laparotomy (1.2 mg/dL vs. 1.4 mg/dL; p = 0.078). Forty-eight hours after TAC, HTS patients had significantly higher serum sodium (145.8 mEq/L vs. 142.2 mEq/L, p < 0.001), chloride (111.8 mEq/L vs. 106.6 mEq/L, p < 0.001), and osmolarity (305.8 mOsm/kg vs. 299.4 mOsm/kg; p = 0.006), and significantly lower arterial pH (7.34 vs. 7.38; p = 0.011). The HTS patients had lower intravenous fluid (IVF) volumes within 48 hours of TAC (8.5 L vs. 11.8 L; p = 0.004). Serum creatinine, urine output, and kidney injury were similar between groups. Fascial closure was achieved for 92% of all HTS patients and 77% of all standard resuscitation patients (p = 0.063). Considering all 189 patients, higher IVF resuscitation volumes within 48 hours of TAC were associated with decreased odds of fascial closure (odds ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.83-0.97; p = 0.003). Hypertonic saline resuscitation was associated with the development of a hypernatremic, hyperchloremic, hyperosmolar acidosis, and lower total IVF resuscitation volumes, without adversely affecting renal function. These findings may not be generalizable to patients with baseline renal dysfunction and susceptibility to hyperchloremic acidosis-induced kidney injury. Prognostic study, level II."

This single-institution retrospective review included patients <18 years of age (n = 331) who underwent appendectomy for acute appendicitis from 2008 to 2012. Demographic, clinical, procedural, and follow-up data (primary outcome was measured as Clavien-Dindo grade of complication severity) were abstracted. AAST grades were generated based on intraoperative findings. Summary, univariate, and multivariable regression analyses were performed to compare AAST grade and outcomes. Overall, 331 patients (46% female) were identified with a median age of 12 (IQR, 8-15) years. Appendectomy was laparoscopic in 90% and open in 10%. AAST grades included: Normal (n = 13, 4%), I (n = 152, 46%), II (n = 90, 27%), III (n = 43, 13%), IV (n = 24 7.3%), and V (n = 9 2.7%). Increased AAST grade was associated with increased Clavien-Dindo severity, P =.001. The overall complication rate was 13.6% and was comprised by superficial surgical site infection (n = 13, 3.9%), organ space infection (n = 15, 4.5%), and readmission (n = 17, 5.1%). Median duration of stay increased with AAST grade (P < .0001). Nominal logistic regression identified the following as predictors of any complication (P < .05): AAST grade and febrile temperature at admission. The AAST appendicitis grading system is valid in a single-institution pediatric population. Increasing AAST grade incrementally corresponds with patient outcomes including increased risk of complications and severity of complications. Determination of the generalizability of this grading system is required."

    "abstract": "In 2008 Uranues published the results of a questionnaire sent to experts across 27 European countries on the assessment of attitudes toward acute care surgery and he concluded that no unified system of acute care surgery in Europe was yet developed due to different approaches to the surgical critical patient and that, with exception of some dedicated centres, the intra-hospital resources were not dedicated to acute care surgery patients with consequent negative impact on ideal treatment both in the elective and acute patients (1). The problem in most of European countries is still the same: who is the best surgeon to deal with these patients with an acute surgical condition? The era of the \"omnipotent general surgeon\" is to an end and in order to improve quality in specific areas many institutions dedicate most of their economic resources to highly specialized surgical units; nowadays young committed surgeons are therefore attracted by the so-called \"organ specific surgery\" and take care of emergency surgery and trauma cases just because of a contractual obligation. The lack of subspecialty in trauma and acute care and the lack of interest in the treatment of such complex surgical and trauma cases did not give impetus to the development of clinical standards or professional accreditations guidelines causing a perfect storm with consequent provided care that is less than optimal."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) admissions account for more than three million hospitalizations in the US annually; and interhospital transfers (IHTs) are costly. We aimed to better understand the population of transferred EGS patients and their subsequent care in a nationally representative sample. Using the 2002-2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample, we identified patients aged ≥18 years with an EGS noncardiovascular principal diagnosis who were transferred from another hospital with urgent or emergent admission status. Patient demographics, hospitalization characteristics, rates of operation, and mortality were identified. Procedure codes were classified into surgery and procedures based on the HCUP Surgery Flag. We identified an estimated 525,913 EGS admissions transferred from another acute care hospital. The mean age was 60 years, 51% were female, and >50% were Medicare patients. The rate of EGS IHTs increased while mortality decreased. Surgery was required for only 33% of transferred patients. The most common surgeries were laparoscopic cholecystectomy, lysis of adhesions, and wound debridement. The median length of stay was 4.4 days, 92% of patients were cared for in urban hospitals, and >50% in teaching hospitals. The percent of patients with an EGS diagnosis requiring IHT is increasing, which may reflect a trend toward regionalization of EGS. Transfers require significant resources and may delay care. More than half of the EGS patients did not require surgical intervention. Future studies to identify populations who benefit from IHT and ideal timing of transfer can establish opportunities for optimizing resource utilization and patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Patients managed nonoperatively have been excluded from risk-adjusted benchmarking programs, including the American College of Surgeons (ACS) National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP). Consequently, optimal performance evaluation is not possible for specialties like emergency general surgery (EGS) where nonoperative management is common. We developed a multi-institutional EGS clinical data registry within ACS NSQIP that includes patients managed nonoperatively to evaluate variability in nonoperative care across hospitals and identify gaps in performance assessment that occur when only operative cases are considered. Using ACS NSQIP infrastructure and methodology, surgical consultations for acute appendicitis, acute cholecystitis, and small bowel obstruction (SBO) were sampled at 13 hospitals that volunteered to participate in the EGS clinical data registry. Standard NSQIP variables and 16 EGS-specific variables were abstracted with 30-day follow-up. To determine the influence of complications in nonoperative patients, rates of adverse outcomes were identified, and hospitals were ranked by performance with and then without including nonoperative cases. Two thousand ninety-one patients with EGS diagnoses were included, 46.6% with appendicitis, 24.3% with cholecystitis, and 29.1% with SBO. The overall rate of nonoperative management was 27.4%, 6.6% for appendicitis, 16.5% for cholecystitis, and 69.9% for SBO. Despite comprising only 27.4% of patients in the EGS pilot, nonoperative management accounted for 67.7% of deaths, 34.3% of serious morbidities, and 41.8% of hospital readmissions. After adjusting for patient characteristics and hospital diagnosis mix, addition of nonoperative management to hospital performance assessment resulted in 12 of 13 hospitals changing performance rank, with four hospitals changing by three or more positions. This study identifies a gap in performance evaluation when nonoperative patients are excluded from surgical quality assessment and demonstrates the feasibility of incorporating nonoperative care into existing surgical quality initiatives. Broadening the scope of hospital performance assessment to include nonoperative management creates an opportunity to improve the care of all surgical patients, not just those who have an operation.

We examined national emergency general surgery capacity and county-level determinants of access to emergency general surgery care with special attention to disparities. To identify potential emergency general surgery hospitals, we queried the database of the American Hospital Association for \"acute care general hospital,\" with \"surgical services,\" and \"emergency department,\" and ≥1 \"operating room.\" Internet search and direct contact confirmed emergency general surgery services that covered the emergency room 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. Geographic and population-level emergency general surgery access was derived from Geographic Information Systems and US Census. Of the 6,356 hospitals in the 2013 American Hospital Association database, only 2,811 were emergency general surgery hospitals. Counties with greater percentages of black, Hispanic, uninsured, and low-education individuals and rural counties disproportionately lacked access to emergency general surgery care. For example, counties above the 75th percentile of African American population (10.2%) had >80% odds of not having an emergency general surgery hospital compared with counties below the 25th percentile of African American population (0.6%). Gaps in access to emergency general surgery services exist across the United States, disproportionately affecting underserved, rural communities.

    "abstract": "Frailty is a measure of decreased physiological reserve that is associated with morbidity and mortality in major elective and emergency general surgery operations, independent of chronological age. To date, the association of frailty with outcomes in ambulatory general surgery has not been established. To determine the association between frailty and perioperative morbidity in patients undergoing ambulatory general surgery operations. A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 140 828 patients older than 40 years of age from the 2007-2010 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Participant Use File who underwent ambulatory and 23-hour-stay hernia, breast, thyroid, or parathyroid surgery. Data analysis was performed from August 18, 2016, to June 21, 2017. The association between the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program modified frailty index and perioperative morbidity was determined via multivariable logistic regression with random-effects modeling to control for clustering within Current Procedural Terminology codes. A total of 140 828 patients (80 147 women and 60 681 men; mean [SD] age, 59.3 [12.0] years) underwent ambulatory hernia (n = 71 455), breast (n = 51 267), thyroid, or parathyroid surgery (n = 18 106). Of these patients, 2457 (1.7%) experienced any type of perioperative complication and 971 (0.7%) experienced serious perioperative complications. An increasing modified frailty index was associated with a stepwise increase in the incidence of complications. In multivariable analysis adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, anesthesia type, tobacco use, renal failure, corticosteroid use, and clustering by Current Procedural Terminology codes, an intermediate modified frailty index score (0.18-0.35, corresponding to 2-3 frailty traits) was associated with statistically significant odds ratios of 1.70 (95% CI, 1.54-1.88; P < .001) for any complication and 2.00 (95% CI, 1.72-2.34; P < .001) for serious complications. A high modified frailty index score (≥0.36, corresponding to ≥4 frailty traits) was associated with statistically significant odds ratios of 3.35 (95% CI, 2.52-4.46; P < .001) for any complication and 3.95 (95% CI, 2.65-5.87; P < .001) for serious complications. Anesthesia with local and monitored anesthesia care was the only modifiable covariate associated with decreased odds of serious 30-day complications, with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.53-0.81; P < .001). Frailty is associated with increased perioperative morbidity in common ambulatory general surgery operations, independent of age, type of anesthesia, and other comorbidities. Surgeons should consider frailty rather than chronological age when counseling and selecting patients for elective ambulatory surgery."

Literature reports that patients undergoing surgery with an elevated HbA1c level are associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of HbA1c level on outcomes after emergency general surgery (EGS). We performed a 3-year analysis of our prospectively maintained EGS database. Patients who had HbA1c levels measured within 3 months before surgery were included. Patients were divided into two groups (HbA1c < 6 and HbA1c ≥ 6). Our primary outcome measures included in-hospital complications (major and minor complications), hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, and mortality. Secondary outcomes measures were 30-day complications, readmissions, and mortality. Multivariate and linear regressions were performed. Of the 402 study patients, mean age was 61 ± 12 years, 53% were females, and 63.8% were diabetics. Overall, 49% had an HbA1c ≥ 6%; the mortality rate was 6%. Those with hypertension, history of coronary artery disease, and body mass index of 30 kg/m or greater were more likely to have HbA1c of 6.0% or greater. 7.9% patients experienced major complications. Patients with HbA1c of 6% or greater had a higher complication rate (36% vs 11%, p < 0.001) than those with HbA1c less than 6%. However there was no difference in mortality between two groups (p = 0.09). After controlling for confounders, HbA1c ≥ 6.0% (odds ratio [OR], 2.9; p < 0.01) and a postoperative random blood sugar (RBS) of 200 mg/dL or greater (OR, 2.3; p < 0.01) were independent predictors of major complications. Patients with both HbA1c of 6.0% or greater and postoperative RBS of 200 or greater had higher odds (OR, 4.2; p < 0.01) of developing major complication. After adjusting for confounders, a higher HbA1c was independently correlated with a higher postoperative RBS (b = 0.494, [19.7-28.4], p = 0.02), but there was no correlation with the preoperative RBS. Patients with HbA1c of 6.0% or greater and a postoperative RBS of 200 mg/dL or greater have a four times higher risk of developing major complications after EGS.

If this misdistribution represents a shortage of available surgeons, it is possible that outcomes for rural patients may suffer. The objective of this study was to explore differences in outcomes for emergency general surgery (EGS) conditions between rural and urban hospitals using a nationally representative sample. Data from the 2007-2011 National Inpatient Sample were queried for adult patients (≥18 years) with a primary diagnosis consistent with an EGS condition, as defined by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma. Urban and rural patients were matched on patient-level factors using coarsened exact matching. Differences in outcomes including mortality, morbidity, length of stay (LOS), and total cost of hospital care were assessed using multivariable regression models. Analogous counterfactual models were used to further examine hypothetical outcomes, assuming that all patients had been treated at urban centers. A total of 3,749,265 patients were admitted with an EGS condition during the study period. Of 3259 hospitals analyzed, 40.2% (n = 1310) were rural; they treated 14.6% of patients. Relative to urban centers, EGS patients treated at rural centers had higher odds of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.21-1.28) and lower odds of major complications (OR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.96-0.99). Rural patients had 0.51 d (95% CI: 0.50-0.53) shorter LOS and $744 (95% CI: 712-774) higher cost of hospitalization compared to urban patients. In counterfactual models overall odds of death decreased by 0.05%, whereas the overall odds of complications increased by 0.02%. Overall difference in LOS and total costs were comparable with absolute differences of 0.08 d and $98, respectively. Despite the statistically significant difference in mortality and cost of care at rural versus urban hospitals, the magnitude of absolute differences is sufficiently small to indicate limited clinical importance. Large urban centers are designed to manage complex cases, but our results suggest that for cases appropriate to treat in rural hospitals, equivalent outcomes are found. These findings will inform future work on rural outcomes and provide impetus for regionalization of care for complex EGS presentations."

The aim of this multicentre prospective cohort study is to describe the burden, variation in management and associated outcomes of SBO in the UK adult population. UK hospitals providing emergency general surgery are eligible to participate. This study has three components: (1) a clinical preference questionnaire to be completed by consultants providing emergency general surgical care to assesses preferences in diagnostics and therapeutic approaches, including laparoscopy and nutritional interventions; (2) site resource profile questionnaire to indicate ease of access to diagnostic services, operating theatres, nutritional support teams and postoperative support including intensive care; (3) prospective cohort study of all cases of SBO admitted during an 8-week period at participating trusts. Data on diagnostics, operative and nutritional interventions, and in-hospital mortality and morbidity will be captured, followed by data validation. This will be conducted as a national audit of practice in conjunction with trainee research collaboratives, with support from patient representatives, surgeons, anaesthetists, gastroenterologists and a clinical trials unit. Site-specific reports will be provided to each participant site as well as an overall report to be disseminated through specialist societies. Results will be published in a formal project report endorsed by stakeholders, and in peer-reviewed scientific reports.

From 2010 to 2014, seven institutions from the Southwest Surgical Multicenter Trials (SWSC MCT) group conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the clinical course of all patients on IAT who underwent urgent/emergent laparoscopic appendectomy. The IAT+ group was subdivided into IAT+ (Aspirin only) and IAT+ (Aspirin-Plavix). These groups were matched 1:1 to controls. The primary outcomes were estimated blood loss (EBL) and transfusion requirement. Secondary outcomes included infections (SSI - Surgical Site Infection, DSI - Deep Space Infection, and OSI - Organ Space Infection), hospital length of stay (HLOS), complications, 30-day readmissions, and mortality. Out of the 2903 patients included in the study, 287 IAT+ patients were identified and matched in a 1:1 ratio to 287 IAT-patients. In the IAT+ vs IAT-analysis, no significant differences in EBL (p = 1.0), transfusion requirement during the preoperative (p = 0.5), intraoperative (p = 0.3) or postoperative periods (p = 0.5), infectious complications (SSI; p = 1.0, DSI; p = 1.0, and OSI; p = 0.1), overall complications (p = 0.3), HLOS (p = 0.7), 30-day readmission (p = 0.3), or mortality (p = 0.1) were noted.

Our analysis suggests that IAT is not associated with worse outcomes in urgent/emergent laparoscopic appendectomy. Prehospital use of IAT should not be used to delay laparoscopic appendectomy."

    "title": "Geographic Diffusion and Implementation of Acute Care Surgery: An Uneven Solution to the National Emergency General Surgery Crisis.",
    "abstract": "Owing to lack of adequate emergency care infrastructure and decline in general surgery workforce, the United States faces a crisis in access to emergency general surgery (EGS) care. Acute care surgery (ACS), an organized system of trauma, general surgery, and critical care, is a proposed solution; however, ACS diffusion remains poorly understood. To investigate geographic diffusion of ACS models of care and characterize the communities in which ACS implementation is lagging. A national survey on EGS practices was developed, tested, and administered at all 2811 US acute care hospitals providing EGS to adults between August 2015 and October 2015. Surgeons responsible for EGS coverage at these hospitals were approached. If these surgeons failed to respond to the initial survey implementation, secondary surgeons or chief medical officers at hospitals with only 1 general surgeon were approached. Survey responses on ACS implementation were linked with geocoded hospital data and national census data to determine geographic diffusion of and access to ACS. We measured the distribution of hospitals with ACS models of care vs those without over time (diffusion) and by US counties characterized by sociodemographic characteristics of county residents (access). Survey response rate was 60% (n = 1690); 272 responding hospitals had implemented ACS by 2015, steadily increasing from 34 in 2001 to 125 in 2010. Acute care surgery implementation has not been uniform. Rural regions have limited ACS access, with hospitals in counties with greater than the 75th percentile population having 5.4 times higher odds (95% CI, 1.66-7.35) of implementing ACS than hospitals in counties with less than 25th percentile population. Communities with greater percentages of adults without a college degree also have limited ACS access (OR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.81-6.48). However, incorporating EGS into ACS models may be a potential equalizer for poor, black, and Hispanic communities. Understanding and addressing gaps in ACS implementation across communities will be crucial to ensuring health equity for US residents experiencing general surgery emergencies."

    "title": "Understanding the \"Weekend Effect\" for Emergency General Surgery.",
    "abstract": "Several studies have identified a \"weekend effect\" for surgical outcomes, but definitions vary and the cause is unclear. Our aim was to better characterize the weekend effect for emergency general surgery using mortality as a primary endpoint. Using data from the University HealthSystem Consortium from 2009 to 2013, we identified urgent/emergent hospital admissions for seven procedures representing 80% of the national burden of emergency general surgery. Patient characteristics and surgical outcomes were compared between cases that were performed on weekdays vs weekends. Hospitals varied widely in the proportion of procedures performed on the weekend. Of the procedures examined, four had higher mortality for weekend cases (laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, partial colectomy, and small bowel resection; p < 0.01), while three did not (appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and peptic ulcer disease repair). Among the four procedures with increased weekend mortality, patients undergoing weekend procedures also had increased severity of illness and shorter time from admission to surgery (p < 0.01). Multivariate analysis adjusting for patient characteristics demonstrated independently higher mortality on weekends for these same four procedures (p < 0.01). For the first time, we have identified specific emergency general surgery procedures that incur higher mortality when performed on weekends. This may be due to acute changes in patient status that require weekend surgery or indications for urgent procedures (ischemia, obstruction) compared to those without a weekend mortality difference (infection). Hospitals that perform weekend surgery must acknowledge and identify ways to manage this increased risk."

    "abstract": "An emergency surgical airway is a lifesaving intervention required in the event of airway loss or respiratory failure when conventional endotracheal intubation cannot be performed. The Acute Care Surgery/Trauma Service is a critical component in the angioedema/difficult airway protocol at our institution. We conducted a retrospective review (2007-2016) to analyze the role our service has in managing patients requiring an emergency surgical airway. Cases were analyzed for preexisting conditions, hospital location of procedure, techniques, complications, and mortality. Our protocol involves early coordination between anesthesia and the Acute Care Surgery/Trauma Service for patients with a potentially difficult airway. If anesthesia is unable to intubate the patient, a surgical airway is performed. Patients are preemptively taken to the operating room (OR) if stable for transport. There were 43 surgical airways performed during the study period. All patients had a failed attempt with oral endotracheal intubation. The most common factors associated with these patients were history of tracheostomy, angioedema, or difficult anatomy. Nineteen (44%) of the surgical airways were performed in the OR. Three deaths (7%) occurred from cardiac or respiratory arrest despite the emergency procedure. No immediate deaths occurred in the patients taken to the OR. Early coordination in patients with a difficult airway is another hospital resource that the acute care surgeon can provide to improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used analgesic and anti-inflammatory adjuncts. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug administration may potentially increase the risk of postoperative gastrointestinal anastomotic failure (AF). We aim to determine if perioperative NSAID utilization influences gastrointestinal AF in emergency general surgery (EGS) patients undergoing gastrointestinal resection and anastomosis. Post hoc analysis of a multi-institutional prospectively collected database was performed. Anastomotic failure was defined as the occurrence of a dehiscence/leak, fistula, or abscess. Patients using NSAIDs were compared with those without. Summary, univariate, and multivariable analyses were performed. Five hundred thirty-three patients met inclusion criteria with a mean (±SD) age of 60 ± 17.5 years, 53% men. Forty-six percent (n = 244) of the patients were using perioperative NSAIDs. Gastrointestinal AF rate between NSAID and no NSAID was 13.9% versus 10.7% (p = 0.26). No differences existed between groups with respect to perioperative steroid use (16.8% vs. 13.8%; p = 0.34) or mortality (7.39% vs. 6.92%, p = 0.84). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that perioperative corticosteroid (odds ratio, 2.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-4.81) use and the presence of a colocolonic or colorectal anastomoses were independently associated with AF. A subset analysis of the NSAIDs cohort demonstrated an increased AF rate in colocolonic or colorectal anastomosis compared with enteroenteric or enterocolonic anastomoses (30.0% vs. 13.0%; p = 0.03). Perioperative NSAID utilization appears to be safe in EGS patients undergoing small-bowel resection and anastomosis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug administration should be used cautiously in EGS patients with colon or rectal anastomoses. Future randomized trials should validate the effects of perioperative NSAIDs use on AF. Therapeutic study, level III."

    "abstract": "Our objective was to develop an alternate construct for reporting anticipated outcomes after emergency general surgery (EGS) that presents risk in terms of a composite measure. Currently available prediction tools generate risk outputs for discrete as opposed to composite measures of postoperative outcomes. A construct to synthesize multiple discrete estimates into a global understanding of a patient's likely postoperative health status is lacking and could augment shared decision-making conversations. Using the 2012 to 2014 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Participant Use File, we developed the Patient-Centered Outcomes Spectrum (PCOS) for patients ≥65 years old who underwent an EGS operation. The PCOS defines 3 exclusive types of global outcomes (good, intermediate, and bad outcomes) and allows patients to be prospectively stratified by both their EGS diagnosis and preoperative surgical risk profile. Of the patients in our study population, 13,330 (46.4%) experienced a 30-day postoperative course considered a good outcome. Conversely, 3791 (13.2%) of study patients experienced a bad outcome. The remainder of patients (11,617; 40.4%) were classified as experiencing an intermediate outcome. The incidence of good, intermediate, and bad outcomes was 69.7%, 28.2%, and 2.1% for low-risk patients, and 22.0%, 48.9%, and 29.1% for high-risk patients. Diagnosis-specific PCOS constructs are also provided. Consistent with the goals of shared decision-making, the PCOS provides an evidence-based construct based upon a composite outcome measure for patients and providers as they weigh the risks of undergoing EGS."

    "abstract": "The acute care surgery (ACS) model was developed to acknowledge the complexity of a traditionally fractured emergency general surgery patient population, however, there are variations in the design of ACS service models. This meta-analysis analyzes the impact of implementation of different ACS models on the outcomes for appendicitis and biliary disease. A systematic, English-language search of major databases was conducted. From 1,827 papers, 2 independent reviewers identified 25 studies that reported on outcomes for patients with appendicitis (n = 13), biliary disease (n = 7), or both (n = 5), before and after implementation of an ACS service. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to score quality. Outcomes were analyzed using random effect methodology and sensitivity analyses were performed. Significant heterogeneity existed between studies and ACS designs. The overall study quality rating was fair to poor with a moderate risk of bias. After implementation of an ACS service, there was an overall reduction in length of stay by 0.51 days (95% CI -0.81 to -0.20 days) and 0.73 days (95% CI 0.09 to 1.36 days) for appendicitis and biliary disease, respectively. Complication rates were lower after implementing ACS (odds ratio 0.65; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.86 and odds ratio 0.46; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.61). There was no difference in after-hours operating for either appendicitis or biliary disease, except when considering ACS models with dedicated theater time, which favors an ACS model (odds ratio 0.49; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.73) in appendicitis. The ACS model has been shown to benefit acute care surgery patients with improved access to care, fewer complications, and decreased length of stay for 2 common disease processes. The design and implementation of an ACS service can impact the magnitude of effect."

In Western countries, the response has been to separate acute and elective surgery with the creation of a new sub-specialty: acute care surgery. Dedicated acute units have shown improvements in efficiency and clinical outcomes for patients. The aim of this study was to assess the results of the first such unit in Singapore. A retrospective analysis was performed of a 12-month period of acute admissions between May 2014 and April 2015, with comparison of 6-months before and after the creation of the ESAT service. The ESAT service was a consultant led dedicated team managing all daily acute and trauma patients. Demographic, efficiency and clinical outcome key performance indicators were compared. There were 2527 acute admissions split between the two time periods. The ESAT service (N=1279) managed soft tissue infections (257, 20%), appendicitis (199, 16%) and biliary disease (175, 14%) most commonly. The most common of the 573 procedures performed were incision and drainage (242, 42%), appendicectomy (188, 33%) and laparotomy (84, 16%). Clinical outcome during the ESAT service included reduction in overall mean length of stay (4.5d to 3.5d, P<0.01) and mortality (24/1248 (1.9%) to 11/1279 (0.9%), P=0.03). Efficiency gains in theatre booking time, ED surgical review and overall costs were also noted.

We assessed associations between surgeon and hospital EGS volume with these outcomes. Using Maryland's Health Services Cost Review Commission database, we identified nontrauma EGS procedures performed by general surgeons among patients 20 years or older, who were admitted urgently or emergently, from July 2012 to September 2014. We created surgeon and hospital volume categories, stratified EGS procedures into simple (mortality ≤ 0.5%) and complex (>0.5%) procedures, and assessed postoperative mortality, complications, and 30-day readmissions. Multivariable logistic regressions both adjusted for clinical factors and accounted for clustering by individual surgeons. We identified 14,753 procedures (61.5% simple EGS, 38.5% complex EGS) by 252 (73.3%) low-volume surgeons (≤25 total EGS procedures/year), 63 (18.3%) medium-volume surgeons (26 to 50/year), and 29 (8.4%) high-volume surgeons (>50/year). Low-volume surgeons operated on one-third (33.1%) of all patients. For simple procedures, the very low rate of death (0.2%) prevented a meaningful regression with mortality; however, there were no associations between low-volume surgeons and complications (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.07; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.41) or 30-day readmissions (aOR 0.80; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.01) relative to high-volume surgeons. Among complex procedures, low-volume surgeons were associated with greater mortality (aOR 1.64; 95% CI 1.12 to 2.41) relative to high-volume surgeons, but not complications (aOR 1.06; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.32) or 30-day readmission (aOR 0.99; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.22). Low-volume hospitals (≤125 total EGS procedures/year) relative to high-volume hospitals (>250/year) were not associated with mortality, complications, or 30-day readmissions for simple or complex procedures. We found evidence that surgeon EGS volume was associated with outcomes. Developing EGS-specific services, mentorship opportunities, and clinical pathways for less-experienced surgeons may improve outcomes."

Immediate surgical and long-term oncologic outcomes were evaluated after an appropriate matching process was performed. The immediate surgical outcome of PGC, i.e., the hospital mortality rate within 30 d after surgery, did not significantly differ from that of non-cancer related gastroduodenal perforation. The long-term oncologic outcome, with matching by age, gender, year of surgery and AJCC 7th stage grouping, also did not significantly differ from that of GC without perforation. Aggressive surgical treatment, including an initial emergency procedure for containing peritonitis and radical surgery for GC, may benefit PGC patients in terms of both the immediate and oncologic outcomes."

As the US population ages and discussions surrounding the optimal method of insurance provision increasingly enter into national debate, longer-term outcomes are of paramount concern. It remains unclear the extent to which insurance changes disparities throughout patients' postacute recovery period among older adults. Survival analysis of 2008 to 2014 Medicare data using risk-adjusted Cox proportional-hazards models. A total of 6,779,649 older adults were included, of whom 82.8% identified as non-Hispanic white (NHW), 9.2% non-Hispanic black (NHB), 5.6% Hispanic, and 1.5% non-Hispanic Asian (NHA). Relative to NHW patients, each group of minority patients was significantly less likely to die [30-day NHB vs NHW hazard ratio (95% confidence interval): 0.88 (0.86-0.89)]. Differences became less apparent as outcomes approached 180 days [180-day NHB vs NHW: 1.00 (0.98-1.02)]. For major morbidity and unplanned readmission, differences among NHW, Hispanic, and NHA patients were comparable. NHB patients did consistently worse. Efforts to explain the occurrence found similar trends across diagnostic categories, but significant differences in disparities attributable to geography and the other included factors that combined accounted for up to 50% of readmission differences between racial/ethnic groups. The study found an inversion of racial/ethnic mortality differences and mitigation of non-NHB morbidity/readmission differences among universally insured older adults that decreased with time. Persistent disparities among nonagenarian patients and hospitals managing a regionally large share of minority patients warrant particular concern."

    "abstract": "Introduction Emergency general surgery services in England are undergoing rapid structural change with the aim of improving care. In our centre, the key issues identified were high numbers of admissions, inappropriate referrals, prolonged waiting times, delayed senior input and poor patient satisfaction. A new model was launched in January 2015 to address these issues: the surgical triage unit (STU). This study assesses the success of the new service. Methods All emergency general surgical admissions during a five-month period before introduction of the STU were compared with those of a comparable five-month period after its introduction. Process, clinical and patient experience outcomes were assessed to identify improvement. Results Attendance fell from 3,304 patients in the 2014 cohort to 2,830 in the 2015 cohort. During the 2015 study period, 279 more patients were discharged on the same day. Resource requirement fell by 2,635 bed days (23%). The number of true surgical emergencies remained consistent. Rates for reattendance (7.8% for 2014 vs 8.1% for 2015) and readmission (5.7% for 2014 vs 5.7% for 2015) showed no significant difference. Patient experience data demonstrated a significant improvement in both net promoter score (64.1 vs 82.2) and number of complaints (34 vs 5). Clinical outcomes for low risk procedures remained similar. Emergency laparotomy in-hospital mortality fell (11.4% vs 10.3%) despite preoperative risk stratification suggesting a risk burden that was significantly higher than the national average. Conclusions This novel model of emergency general surgery provision has improved clinical efficiency, patient satisfaction and outcomes. We encourage other units to consider similar programmes of service improvement."

Although complex, elective operations performed at safety-net hospitals have been associated with inferior outcomes and higher costs, it is unclear whether a similar association has been seen with common emergency general surgery performed at safety-net hospitals. To evaluate the association of safety-net burden with the outcomes of appendectomy. A retrospective review was conducted of all nonfederally funded hospitals in the California state inpatient database that performed appendectomies from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2011. A total of 349 hospitals performing 274 405 nonincidental appendectomies were stratified based on safety-net burden; low-burden hospitals had the lowest quartile of patients who either had Medicaid or were uninsured (0%-14%), medium-burden hospitals had the middle 2 quartiles (15%-41%), and high-burden hospitals had the highest quartile (>42%). Data analysis was performed from August 27 to September 8, 2016. Rates of laparoscopy, perforation, negative appendectomy, morbidity, length of stay, and cost. Among the 349 hospitals in the study, high-burden hospitals treated a larger proportion of black patients than did medium- and low-burden hospitals (4.5% vs 2.4% vs 2.9%; P = .01), as well as Hispanic patients (64.8% vs 27.0% vs 22.0%; P < .001) and patients with perforated appendicitis (27.6% vs 23.6% vs 23.6%; P = .005). High-burden hospitals were less likely than medium- or low-burden hospitals to use laparoscopy (51.6% vs 60.7% vs 71.9%; P < .001). There were no differences in morbidity, length of stay, or cost. Multivariable regression analysis confirmed that high-burden hospitals were more likely than low-burden hospitals to treat perforated appendicitis (log %, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.03-0.12; P = .04) and less likely to use laparoscopy (-16.9% difference; 95% CI, -26.1% to -7.6%; P < .001), while achieving similar complication rates. Multivariable analysis also confirmed that high-burden hospitals have similar costs, despite being associated with longer length of stay (relative risk, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.09-1.26; P < .001). Safety-net hospitals treat a disproportionate number of patients with advanced appendicitis while falling behind in the use of laparoscopy. Nonetheless, safety-net hospitals treat this common surgical emergency with morbidity and cost similar to that seen at other hospitals. Additional research is needed to evaluate how these outcomes are achieved to improve all surgical outcomes at underresourced hospitals."

Similarly, nonelective vascular surgery may benefit from specific management and resource capabilities. To establish the burden and scope of vascular acute care surgery, we analyzed the characteristics and outcomes of patients hospitalized for vascular surgical procedures in Maryland. A retrospective analysis of a statewide inpatient database was performed to identify patients undergoing noncardiac vascular procedures in Maryland from 2009 to 2013. Patients were stratified by admission acuity as elective, urgent, or emergent, with the last two groups defined as acute. The primary outcome was inpatient mortality, and secondary outcomes were critical care and hospital resource requirements. Groups were compared by univariate analyses, with multivariable analysis of mortality based on acuity level and other potential risk factors for death. Of 3,157,499 adult hospital admissions, 154,004 (5%) patients underwent a vascular procedure; most were acute (54% emergent, 13% urgent), whereas 33% were elective. Acute patients had higher rates of critical care morbidity and required more hospital resource utilization. Admission for acute vascular surgery was independently associated with mortality (urgent odds ratio, 2.1; emergent odds ratio, 3.0). The majority of inpatient vascular care in Maryland is for acute vascular surgery, which is an independent risk factor for mortality. Acute vascular surgical care entails greater critical care and hospital resource utilization and-similar to emergency general surgery-may benefit from dedicated training and practice models."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery outcomes vary widely across the United States. The utilization of quality indicators can reduce variation and assist providers in administering care aligned with established recommendations. Previous quality indicators have not focused on emergency general surgery patients. We identified indicators of high-quality emergency general surgery care and assessed patient- and hospital-level compliance with these indicators. We utilized a modified Delphi technique (RAND Appropriateness Methodology) to develop quality indicators. Through 2 rankings, an expert panel ranked potential quality indicators for validity. We then examined historic compliance with select quality indicators after 4 nonelective procedures (cholecystectomy, appendectomy, colectomy, small bowel resection) at 4 academic centers. Of 25 indicators rated as valid, 13 addressed patient-level quality and 12 addressed hospital-level quality. Adherence with 18 indicators was assessed. Compliance with performing a cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis within 72 hours of symptom onset ranged from 45% to 76%. Compliance with surgery start times within 3 hours from the decision to operate for uncontained perforated viscus ranged from 20% to 100%. Compliance with exploration of patients with small bowel obstructions with ischemia/impending perforation within 3 hours of the decision to operate was 0% to 88%. For 3 quality indicators (auditing 30-day unplanned readmissions/operations for patients previously managed nonoperatively, monitoring time to source control for intra-abdominal infections, and having protocols for bypass/transfer), none of the hospitals were compliant. Developing indicators for providers to assess their performance provides a foundation for specific initiatives. Adherence to quality indicators may improve the quality of emergency general surgery care provided for which current outcomes are potentially modifiable."

    "abstract": "Care pathways are a prominent feature of efforts to improve healthcare quality, outcomes and accountability, but sociological studies of pathways often find professional resistance to standardisation. This qualitative study examined the adoption and adaptation of a novel pathway as part of a randomised controlled trial in an unusually complex, non-linear field - emergency general surgery - by teams of surgeons and physicians in six theoretically sampled sites in the UK. We find near-universal receptivity to the concept of a pathway as a means of improving peri-operative processes and outcomes, but concern about the impact on appropriate professional judgement. However, this concern translated not into resistance and implementation failure, but into a nuancing of the pathways-as-realised in each site, and their use as a means of enhancing professional decision-making and inter-professional collaboration. We discuss our findings in the context of recent literature on the interplay between managerialism and professionalism in healthcare, and highlight practical and theoretical implications."

    "abstract": "Poor communication causes fragmented care. Studies of transitions of care within a hospital and on discharge suggest significant communication deficits. Communication during transfers between hospitals has not been well studied. We assessed the written communication provided during interhospital transfers of emergency general surgery patients. We hypothesized that patients are transferred with incomplete documentation from referring facilities. We performed a retrospective review of written communication provided during interhospital transfers to our emergency department (ED) from referring EDs for emergency general surgical evaluation between January 1, 2014 and January 1, 2016. Elements of written communication were abstracted from referring facility documents scanned into the medical record using a standardized abstraction protocol. Descriptive statistics summarized the information communicated. A total of 129 patients met inclusion criteria. 87.6% (n = 113) of charts contained referring hospital documents. 42.5% (n = 48) were missing history and physicals. Diagnoses were missing in 9.7% (n = 11). Ninety-one computed tomography scans were performed; among 70 with reads, final reads were absent for 70.0% (n = 49). 45 ultrasounds and x-rays were performed; among 27 with reads, final reads were missing for 80.0% (n = 36). Reasons for transfer were missing in 18.6% (n = 21). Referring hospital physicians outside the ED were consulted in 32.7% (n = 37); consultants' notes were absent in 89.2% (n = 33). In 12.4% (n = 14), referring documents arrived after the patient's ED arrival and were not part of the original documentation provided. This study documents that information important to patient care is often missing in the written communication provided during interhospital transfers. This gap affords a foundation for standardizing provider communication during interhospital transfers."

    "abstract": "The number of surgical procedures performed in elderly and frail patients has greatly increased in the last decades. However, there is little research in the elderly emergency general surgery patient. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of frailty in the emergency general surgery population in Belgium. Secondly, we examined the length of hospital stay, readmission rate and mortality at 30 and 90 days. We conducted a prospective observational study at Ghent University Hospital. All patients older than 65 admitted to a general surgery ward from the emergency department were eligible for inclusion. Primary endpoint was mortality at 30 days. Secondary outcomes were mortality at 90 days, readmissions and length of stay. Cross-sectional observations were performed using the Fisher exact test, Mann-Whitney U-test, or one-way ANOVA. We performed a COX multivariable analysis to identify independent variables associated with mortality at 30 and 90 days as well as the readmission risk. Data were collected from 98 patients in a four-month period. 23.5% of patients were deemed frail. 79% of all patients underwent abdominal surgery. Univariate analyses showed that polypharmacy, multimorbidity, a history of falls, hearing impairment and urinary incontinence were statistically significantly different between the non-frail and the group. Frail patients showed a higher incidence for mortality within 30 days (9% versus 1.3% (p = .053)). There were no differences between the two groups for mortality at 90 days, readmission, length of stay and operation. Frailty was a predictor for mortality at 90 days (p= .025) (hazard ratio (HR) 10.83 (95%CI 1.34-87.4)). Operation (p= .084) (HR 0.16 (95%CI 0.16-1.29)) and the presence of chronic cardiac failure (p= .049) (HR 0.38 (95%CI 0.14-0.99)) were protective for mortality at 90 days. Frailty is a significant predictor for mortality for elderly patients undergoing emergency abdominal/general surgery. Level II therapeutic study."

We sought to identify trends in disparities in EGS-related operative mortality over a 20-y period. The National Inpatient Sample was used to identify patient encounters coded for EGS in 1993, 2003, and 2013. Logistic regression models were used to examine the adjusted relationship between race, primary payer status, and median income quartiles and in-hospital mortality after adjusting for patients' age, gender, Elixhauser comorbidity score, and hospital region, size, and location-cum-teaching status. We identified 391,040 patient encounters. In 1993, Black race was associated with higher odds of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.35 [1.20-1.53]) than White race, although this difference dissipated in subsequent years. Medicare, Medicaid, and underinsured patients had a higher odds of mortality than those with private insurance for the entire 20-y period; only the disparity in the underinsured decreased over time (1993, 1.63 [1.35-1.98]; 2013, 1.41 [1.20-1.67]). In 2003 (1.23 [1.10-1.38]) and 2013 (1.23 [1.11-1.37]), patients from the lowest income quartile were more likely to die after EGS than patients from the highest income quartile. Socioeconomic disparities in EGS-related operative morality followed inconsistent trends. Over time, while gaps in in-hospital mortality among Blacks and Whites have narrowed, disparities among patients belonging to lowest income quartile have worsened. Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries continued to experience higher odds of in-hospital mortality relative to those with private insurance."

Previous work has demonstrated that dedicated acute care surgery (ACS) services can facilitate IC. However, the associated financial costs and economic effectiveness of this intervention are unknown and represent potential barriers to ACS adoption. We investigated the impact of an ACS service at two hospitals before and after implementation on cost effectiveness, patient quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and impact on rates of IC. All patients admitted with non-severe GSP to two tertiary care teaching hospitals from January 2008-May 2015 were reviewed. The diagnosis of GSP was confirmed upon review of clinical, biochemical and radiographic criteria. Patients were divided into three time periods based on the presence of ACS (none, at one hospital, at both hospitals). Data were collected regarding demographics, cholecystectomy timing, resource utilization, and associated costs. QALY analyses were performed and incremental cost effectiveness ratios were calculated comparing pre-ACS to post-ACS periods. In 435 patients admitted for GSP, IC increased from 16 to 76% after implementing an ACS service at both hospitals. There was a significant reduction in admissions and emergency room visits for GSP after introduction of ACS services (p < 0.001). There was no difference in length of stay or conversion to an open operation. The implementation of the ACS service was associated with a decrease in cost of $1162 per patient undergoing cholecystectomy, representing a 12.6% savings. The time period with both hospitals having established ACS services resulted in a highly favorable cost to quality-adjusted life year ratio (QALY gained and financial costs decreased). ACS services facilitate cost-effective management of GSP. The result is improved and timelier patient care with decreased healthcare costs. Hospitals without a dedicated ACS service should strongly consider adopting this model of care."

    "abstract": "Older patients undergoing emergency general surgery (EGS) experience high rates of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Studies focused primarily on elective surgery indicate that frailty is an important predictor of adverse outcomes in older surgical patients. The population-level effect of frailty on EGS is poorly described. Therefore, our objective was to measure the association of preoperative frailty with outcomes in a population of older patients undergoing EGS. We created a population-based cohort study using linked administrative data in Ontario, Canada, that included community-dwelling individuals aged >65 years having EGS. Our main exposure was preoperative frailty, as defined by the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups frailty-defining diagnoses indicator. The Adjusted Clinical Groups frailty-defining diagnoses indicator is a binary variable that uses 12 clusters of frailty-defining diagnoses. Our main outcome measures were 1-year all-cause mortality (primary), intensive care unit admission, length of stay, institutional discharge, and costs of care (secondary). Of 77,184 patients, 19,779 (25.6%) were frail. Death within 1 year occurred in 6626 (33.5%) frail patients compared with 11,366 (19.8%) nonfrail patients. After adjustment for sociodemographic and surgical confounders, this resulted in a hazard ratio of 1.29 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25-1.33). The risk of death for frail patients varied significantly across the postoperative period and was particularly high immediately after surgery (hazard ratio on postoperative day 1 = 23.1, 95% CI 22.3-24.1). Frailty was adversely associated with all secondary outcomes, including a 5.82-fold increase in the adjusted odds of institutional discharge (95% CI 5.53-6.12). After EGS, frailty is associated with increased rates of mortality, institutional discharge, and resource use. Strategies that might improve perioperative outcomes in frail EGS patients need to be developed and tested."

However, acute surgical units are not a financially viable option in these hospitals. To improve the care of emergency general surgery patients at one such hospital, a Rapid Assessment Medical Surgical (RAMS) unit was developed to decrease the time to review and increase the efficiency in caring for these patients. To assess the unit's effect, a prospective analysis was completed of the patients who came through the RAMS unit over a 6-month period and compared with a retrospective analysis of patients presenting in the same 6-month period the year prior to the unit's instigation. The RAMS unit was effective in providing an avenue for faster review by the surgical team. This resulted in patients leaving the emergency department faster, decreased the number of patients that breached emergency department time-targets and increased the number of patients discharged after a period of observation or basic treatments. General surgery patients were managed more efficiently with the RAMS unit in place. However, a full cost analysis is required to determine if such units are cost-effective."

    "abstract": "Noncompressible truncal hemorrhage is a leading cause of potentially preventable death in trauma and acute care surgery patients. These patients are at high risk of exsanguination before potentially life-saving surgical intervention may be performed. Temporary aortic occlusion is an effective means of augmenting systolic blood pressure and perfusion of the heart and brain in these patients. Aortic occlusion temporarily controls distal bleeding until permanent hemostasis can be achieved. The traditional method for temporary aortic occlusion is via resuscitative thoracotomy with cross clamping of the descending aorta. While effective, resuscitative thoracotomy is highly invasive and may worsen blood loss, hypothermia, and coagulopathy by opening an otherwise uninjured body cavity. Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) achieves temporary aortic occlusion using an occlusive balloon catheter that is introduced into the aorta via endovascular access of the common femoral artery. For this reason it is thought that REBOA could provide a less-invasive method for temporary aortic occlusion. Our purpose is to describe our experience with the implementation of REBOA at our Level 1 trauma center. A retrospective case series describing all cases of REBOA performed at a prominent level 1 trauma center between October 2011 and September 2015. The study inclusion criteria were any patient that received a REBOA procedure in the acute phases after injury. There were no exclusion criteria. Data were collected from electronic medical records and the hospital's trauma registry. A total of 31 patients underwent REBOA during the study period. The median age of REBOA patients was 47 (interquartile range [IQR] = 27 to 63) and 77% were male. A majority (87%) of patients sustained blunt trauma. The median injury severity score was 34 (IQR = 22 to 42). The overall survival rate was 32% but varied greatly between subgroups. Balloon inflation resulted in a median increase in systolic blood pressure of 55-mm Hg (IQR 33 to 60), in cases where the data were available (n = 20). A return to spontaneous circulation was noted in 60% of patients who had arrested before REBOA (n = 10). Overall, early death by hemorrhage was 28% with only 2 deaths in the emergency department before reaching the operating room. REBOA is an effective method for achieving temporary aortic occlusion in trauma patients with noncompressible truncal hemorrhage. Balloon inflation correlated with increased blood pressure and temporary hemorrhage control in a vast majority of patients."

Seventy-five percent of the cases were selected at random for model development, whereas 25% of the cases were used for model testing. Stepwise logistic regression was performed for creation of a 30-day mortality risk calculator. Model accuracy and reproducibility was investigated using the concordance index (c statistic) and Pearson correlations. A total of 79,835 patients met inclusion criteria. Overall, 30-day mortality was 12.6%. A simplified risk model formula was derived from five readily available preoperative variables as follows: 0.034*age + 0.8*nonindependent status + 0.88*sepsis + 1.1 (if bun ≥ 29) or 0.57 (if bun ≥18 and < 29) + 1.16 (if albumin < 2.7), or 0.61 (if albumin ≥ 2.7 and < 3.4). The risk of 30-day mortality was stratified into deciles. The risk of 30-day mortality ranged from 2% for patients in the lowest risk level to 31% for patients in the highest risk level. The c statistic was 0.83 in both the derivation and testing samples. Five readily available preoperative variables can be used to predict the 30-day mortality risk for patients undergoing EGS. Further studies are needed to validate this risk calculator and to determine its bedside applicability. Prognostic/epidemiological study, level III."

Multilevel logistic and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to assess the effect of day of the week of surgery on outcome after adjustment for case mix and risk factors.

A total of 50 844 patients were identified, of whom 31 499 had an emergency procedure on Monday to Thursday and 19 345 on Friday to Sunday. Patients undergoing surgery at the weekend were younger (mean 45·9 versus 47·5 years; P < 0·001) and had fewer co-morbidities, but underwent riskier and/or more complex procedures (P < 0·001). Patients who had surgery at the weekend were more likely to have been operated on sooner than those who had weekday surgery (mean time from admission to operation 1·2 versus 1·6 days; P < 0·001). No difference in perioperative mortality (odds ratio 1·00, 95 per cent c.i. 0·89 to 1·13; P = 0·989) or overall survival (hazard ratio 1·01, 0·97 to 1·06; P = 0·583) was observed when surgery was performed at the weekend.

The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) proposed an anatomic severity grading system for EGS diseases to facilitate communication and quality comparisons between providers and hospitals. Previous work has demonstrated validity of the system for appendicitis in the United States. To demonstrate generalizability, we aim to externally validate this grading system in South African patients with appendicitis. Patients with acute appendicitis during 2010 to 2016 were identified at multi-institutional sites within South Africa. Baseline demographics and procedure types were recorded, and AAST grades were assigned based on intraoperative findings. Outcomes included duration of stay, mortality, and Clavien-Dindo complications. Summary statistical univariate and nominal logistic regression analyses were performed to compare AAST grade and outcomes. A total of 1,415 patients with a median (interquartile range) age of 19 years (14-28 years) were included (55% men). One hundred percent underwent appendectomy: 63.5% completed via midline laparotomy, 36.5% via limited incision (31.8% via McBurney incision and 4.7% via laparoscopy). Overall, 30-day mortality rate was 1.4% with an overall complication rate of 44%. Most common complications included surgical site infection (n = 147, 10.4%), pneumonia (n = 105, 7.4%), and renal failure (n = 64, 4.5%). Distribution of AAST grade is as follows: Grade 0 (10, 0.7%), Grade 1 (247, 17.4%), Grade 2 (280, 19.8%), Grade 3 (158, 11.3%), Grade 4 (179, 12.6%), and Grade 5 (541, 38.2%). Increased median (interquartile range) AAST grades were recorded in patients with complications, 5 (3-5) compared with those without (2 [1-3], p = 0.001). Duration of stay was increased for patients with higher AAST grades: 4 and 5 (10.6 ± 5.9 days) versus I and II (3.6 ± 4.3 days; p = 0.001). Area under the receiver operating characteristic analysis to predict presence of any complication based on AAST grade was 0.90. The AAST EGS grading system is valid to predict important clinical outcomes in a South African population with an increased degree of severity on presentation. These results support generalizability of the AAST EGS grading system for appendicitis in a developing nation. Prognostic, level II."

    "abstract": "The management of patients with colonic diverticular perforation is still evolving. Initial lavage with or without simple suture and drainage was suggested in the late 19th century, replaced progressively by the three-stage Mayo Clinic or the two-stage Mickulicz procedures. Fears of inadequate source control prompted the implementation of the resection of the affected segment of colon with formation of a colostomy (Hartman procedure) in the 1970's. Ensuing development of the treatment strategies was driven by the recognition of the high morbidity and mortality and low reversal rates associated with the Hartman procedure. This led to the wider use of resection and primary anastomosis during the 1990's. The technique of lavage and drainage regained popularity during the 1990's. This procedure can also be performed laparoscopically with the advantage of faster recovery and shorter hospital stay. This strategy allows resectional surgery to be postponed or avoided altogether in many patients; and higher rates of primary resection and anastomosis can be achieved avoiding the need for a stoma. The three recent randomized controlled trials comparing laparoscopic peritoneal lavage alone to resectional surgery reported inconsistent outcomes. The aim of this review is to review the historical evolution and future reflections of surgical treatment modalities for diffuse purulent and feculent peritonitis. In this review we classified the various surgical strategies according to Krukowski et al. and Vermeulen et al. and reviewed the literature related to surgical treatment separately for each period."

A retrospective cohort analysis of high-risk EGS admissions using GC's international administrative data set. 23 large hospitals in Australia, England and the USA. Discharge data for a cohort of high-risk EGS patients were collated. Multilevel hierarchical logistic regression analysis was performed to examine geographical and structural differences between GC hospitals. 69 490 patients, admitted to 23 centres across Australia, England and the USA from 2007 to 2012, were identified. For all patients within this cohort, outcomes defined as: 7-day and 30-day inhospital mortality, readmission and length of stay appeared to be superior in US centres. A subgroup of 19 082 patients (27%) underwent emergency abdominal surgery. No geographical differences in mortality were seen at 7 days in this subgroup. 30-day mortality (OR=1.47, p<0.01) readmission (OR=1.42, p<0.01) and length of stay (OR=1.98, p<0.01) were worse in English units. Patient factors (age, pathology, comorbidity) were significantly associated with worse outcome as were structural factors, including low intensive care unit bed ratios, high volume and interhospital transfers. Having dedicated EGS teams cleared of elective commitments with formalised handovers was associated with shorter length of stay. Key factors that influence outcomes were identified. For patients who underwent surgery, outcomes were similar at 7 days but not at 30 days. This may be attributable to better infrastructure and resource allocation towards EGS in the US and Australian centres."

During the period 2010-2016, 59 patients underwent a laparoscopic procedure for colorectal emergency in an acute care setting by a single operating surgeon with advanced laparoscopic skills and specific expertise in both colorectal surgery and acute care surgery. This series includes 32 laparoscopic right colectomies (12 for obstruction and 20 for perforation/peritonitis) and 27 left colectomies (6 for obstruction and 21 for perforation/peritonitis). Twenty-eight ileocolic side-to-side ICA, and 27 left colonic ICA (3 colocolic, 24 colorectal) were performed. Reasonably good postoperative outcomes were observed in the entire series of 59 laparoscopic colectomies performed in an urgent setting.

We hypothesized that, as our EGS service matured, time from imaging to operating room (OR) for cholecystectomy would decrease. At an academic referral center, we identified patients undergoing inpatient cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis during three time periods: before the formation of an EGS service from 2005 to 2007, during the first years of the service from 2008 to 2010, and five years after its development from 2013 to 2014. Charts were reviewed for patient demographics, operative events, and findings. The time of radiologic diagnosis and operation start time were recorded, and time between diagnosis and operation was calculated. A total of 217 patients who met the study criteria were identified, 88 in 2005 to 2007, 84 in 2008 to 2010, and 45 in 2013 to 2014. Time from radiologic diagnosis to OR decreased over the study period, from a median of 48.4 hours in 2005 to 2007 to 32.4 hours in 2008 to 2010 during the early years of the EGS service. Time to OR further decreased to a median of 16.6 hours during 2013 to 2014. The formation and maturation of an EGS service was associated with decreased time to OR after radiologic diagnosis of acute cholecystitis at this institution. This decrease in preoperative time may lead to lower costs and improved outcomes."

    "title": "The Need to Consider Longer-term Outcomes of Care: Racial/Ethnic Disparities Among Adult and Older Adult Emergency General Surgery Patients at 30, 90, and 180 Days.",
    "abstract": "Following calls from the National Institutes of Health and American College of Surgeons for \"urgently needed\" research, the objectives of the present study were to (1) ascertain whether differences in 30/90/180-day mortality, major morbidity, and unplanned readmissions exist among adult (18-64 yr) and older adult (≥65 yr) emergency general surgery (EGS) patients; (2) vary by diagnostic category; and (3) are explained by variations in insurance, income, teaching status, hospital EGS volume, and a hospital's proportion of minority patients. Racial/ethnic disparities have been described in in-hospital and 30-day settings. How longer-term outcomes compare-a critical consideration for the lived experience of patients-has, however, only been limitedly considered. Survival analysis of 2007 to 2011 California State Inpatient Database using Cox proportional hazards models. A total of 737,092 adults and 552,845 older adults were included. In both cohorts, significant differences in 30/90/180-day mortality, major morbidity, and unplanned readmissions were found, pointing to persistently worse outcomes between non-Hispanic Black and White patients [180-d readmission hazard ratio (95% confidence interval):1.04 (1.03-1.06)] and paradoxically better outcomes among Hispanic adults [0.85 (0.84-0.86)] that were not encountered among Hispanic older adults [1.06 (1.04-1.07)]. Stratified results demonstrated robust morbidity and readmission trends between non-Hispanic Black and White patients for the majority of diagnostic categories, whereas variations in insurance/income/teaching status/EGS volume/proportion of minority patients all significantly altered the effect-combined accounting for up to 80% of risk-adjusted differences between racial/ethnic groups. Racial/ethnic disparities exist in longer-term outcomes of EGS patients and are, in part, determined by differences in factors associated with emergency care. Efforts such as these are needed to understand the interplay of influences-both in-hospital and during the equally critical, postacute phase-that underlie disparities' occurrence among surgical patients."

    "abstract": "This case report is intended to inform acute care surgeons about treating rare horizontal laceration of the pancreas head caused by blunt trauma. A 57-year-old woman who sustained blunt abdominal trauma during a car crash was transported to the emergency center of our hospital with unstable vital signs due to hemorrhagic shock. Computed tomography showed transection of the pancreas head and massive intra-abdominal hemorrhage. She was referred for emergency surgery because of a transient response. Laparotomy at five hours after the accident initially revealed consistent massive bleeding from branches of the superior mesenteric artery and vein, which we resolved by suturing the vessels without damaging the main trunks. A horizontal laceration and complete transection of the pancreatic head were then confirmed but the main pancreatic duct remained intact. The lower part of the pancreatic head including the uncus with the attached part of the duodenum was resected, and the pancreatic stump remaining after transection was fixed by suturing. The jejunal limb was attached to the remnant duodenum by side-to-side functional anastomosis. Although gastric emptying was delayed for one month after surgery, the postoperative course was good and the patient recovered at three months thereafter. The embryonic border of pancreas head accompanied with pancreatic divisum was considered for this laceration without disruption of the main pancreatic duct. Blunt pancreatic trauma usually causes vertical transection and thus, horizontal transection is considered rare. The embryological anatomical border between the ventral and dorsal pancreas due to pancreatic divisum was supposed to be transected and therefore the main pancreatic duct was not damaged. Hemorrhagic shock and rare pancreatic head trauma were treated by appropriate intraoperative management."

This study documented the prevalence of sepsis, adherence to guidelines in its management, and timing of source control in general surgical patients presenting as an emergency. Patients aged 16 years or more presenting with emergency general surgery problems were identified over a 7-day period and then screened for sepsis compliance (using the Sepsis Six standards, devised for severe sepsis) and the timing of source control (whether radiological or surgical). Exploratory analyses examined associations between the mode (emergency department or general practitioner) and time of admission, adherence to the sepsis guidelines, and outcomes (complications or death within 30 days). Of a total of 5067 patients from 97 hospitals across the UK, 911 (18·0 per cent) fulfilled the criteria for sepsis, 165 (3·3 per cent) for severe sepsis and 24 (0·5 per cent) for septic shock. Timely delivery of all Sepsis Six guidelines for patients with severe sepsis was achieved in four patients. For patients with severe sepsis, 17·6-94·5 per cent of individual guidelines within the Sepsis Six were delivered. Oxygen was the criterion most likely to be missed, followed by blood cultures in all sepsis severity categories. Surgery for source control occurred a median of 19·8 (i.q.r. 10·0-35·4) h after diagnosis. Omission of Sepsis Six parameters did not appear to be associated with an increase in morbidity or mortality. Although sepsis was common in general surgical patients presenting as an emergency, adherence to severe sepsis guidelines was incomplete in the majority. Despite this, no evidence of harm was apparent."

    "abstract": "Rivaroxaban has gained popularity as an anticoagulant (AC) for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (afib) and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Although adverse bleeding events are associated with all AC, lack of point-of-care testing to measure the effect of rivaroxaban in emergent situations has contributed to perceived increased risk among physicians. This study aims to describe a single-center experience with trauma and emergency general surgery (EGS) patients taking rivaroxaban and evaluate outcomes compared with patients taking warfarin using a propensity score analysis. Trauma and EGS patients taking rivaroxaban or warfarin for afib/VTE over a 2-year period were eligible for inclusion and matched for injury/illness severity in a 1:2 ratio using propensity score matching. In a single quaternary referral center, 192 warfarin patients were matched to 96 rivaroxaban patients. Groups were well matched with no significant difference in age/sex, admission systolic blood pressure/heart rate, admission hemoglobin, injury severity score (trauma patients), or need for ICU admission. Conditional logistic regression determined association of AC type with bleeding complications, adjusting for age/sex, AC indication, coagulation laboratory values, antiplatelet medications or other AC, comorbidities, renal impairment, and operative intervention. Primary outcome was bleeding complications, defined as hemorrhage during admission or as a presenting problem. Secondary outcomes included invasive interventions, AC reversal, VTE complications, and mortality. There was no difference between rivaroxaban and warfarin for bleeding complications (37% vs. 39%, p = 0.49), VTE complications (4.2% vs. 5.7%, p = 0.44), or mortality (4.2% vs. 5.8%, p = 0.63). Fewer rivaroxaban patients underwent surgical or interventional radiology procedures during admission (32% vs. 43%, p = 0.01), but there was no difference in procedures specifically for bleeding (10% vs. 12% p = 0.68). Rivaroxaban patients less frequently underwent AC reversal (34% vs. 46%, p = 0.01) or received multiple reversal agents (20% vs. 29%, p = 0.02). Regression analysis confirmed AC type was not associated with bleeding complications (rivaroxaban vs. warfarin relative risk 1.02; 95% CI 0.85-1.22, p = 0.85). Reversal of rivaroxaban was less common and required fewer agents, whereas bleeding complications and hemostatic interventions do not seem to be different between these AC types.

    "abstract": "Higher volume has been associated with lower mortality for several surgical diseases. It is not known if this relationship exists in the management of Emergency General Surgery (EGS). Our hypothesis was that EGS patients treated at hospitals with higher EGS volume experienced lower mortality rates than those treated at low-volume hospitals. This was a retrospective analysis of 2010 National Inpatient Sample data, maintained by the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research as a representative national sample of inpatients. Patients with EGS diseases were identified using American Association for the Surgery of Trauma definitions using ICD-9 codes (2,640,725 patients from 943 hospitals). Multivariable hierarchical logistic regression model was used to estimate the risk-standardized mortality rate (RSMR) for each hospital, adjusted for patient (age, sex, race, ethnicity, insurance type, socioeconomic status, comorbidities) and hospital (region, location, bed size, teaching status, ownership) characteristics. A cubic spline regression model with 4 knots was used to identify the volume associated with low mortality rates. The volume of EGS patients treated was inversely associated with hospital mortality rate. RSMR in hospitals in the highest quintile of volume (median, 7424 patients) was 1.62% (95% CI: 1.61-1.64%); at hospitals in the lowest quintile of volume (median, 68 patients), it was 6.1% (95% CI: 6.0-6.2%) (p < 0.0001). Mortality rate stabilized at an annual volume of 688 (95% CI: 554-753) patients. The mortality rate in hospitals that treated fewer than 688 patients was 5.0% (95% CI: 4.8-5.1%), compared to 1.99% (95% CI: 1.96-2.01%) at those that treated 688 or more patients (p < 0.0001). EGS patients treated at hospitals with a higher volume of EGS patients experienced lower mortality rates, with a possible threshold of 688 patients per year. A regionalized system of EGS care where complex patients are treated at large-volume centers may improve patient outcomes. Therapeutic study, level III."

A recent retrospective study in emergency general surgery (EGS) patients had similar findings. The aim of the current study was to evaluate HS and ST anastomoses in EGS patients undergoing urgent/emergent operations. The study was sponsored by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Multi-Institutional Studies Committee. Patients undergoing urgent/emergent bowel resection for EGS pathology were prospectively enrolled from July 22, 2013 to December 31, 2015. Patients were grouped by HS/ST anastomoses, and variables were collected. The primary outcome was anastomotic failure. Similar to other studies, anastomotic failure was evaluated at the anastomosis level. Multivariable logistic regression was performed controlling for age and risk factors for anastomotic failure. Fifteen institutions enrolled a total of 595 patients with 649 anastomoses (253 HS and 396 ST). Mean age was 61 years, 51% were men, 7% overall mortality. Age and sex were the same between groups. The overall anastomotic failure rate was 12.5%. The HS group had higher lactate, lower albumin, and were more likely to be on vasopressors. Hospital and intensive care unit days, as well as mortality, were greater in the HS group. Anastomotic failure rates and operative time were equivalent for HS and ST. On multivariate regression, the presence of contamination at initial resection (odds ratio, 1.965; 95% confidence interval, 1.183-3.264) and the patient being managed with open abdomen (odds ratio, 2.529; 95% confidence interval, 1.492-4.286) were independently associated with anastomotic failure, while the type of anastomosis was not. EGS patients requiring bowel resection and anastomosis are at high risk for anastomotic failure. The current study illustrates an apparent bias among acute care surgeons to perform HS techniques in higher-risk patients. Despite the individualized application of technique for differing patient populations, the risk of anastomotic failure was equivalent when comparing HS and ST anastomoses.

The OB Critical Assessment Team (OBCAT Alert) was developed at our institution to facilitate a multidisciplinary response to complex OB/GYN cases. We sought to review and characterize the Acute Care/Trauma Surgeon's role in these cases. We conducted a retrospective review of all emergency consults during an OB/GYN case at our institution from 2008 to 2015. An OBCAT is a hospital based alert system designed to immediately notify OB/GYN, anesthesiology, Acute Care/Trauma, the intensive care unit (ICU), and the blood bank of a potential emergency during an OB/GYN case. There were 7±3 OBCAT alerts/year. Seventeen patients required Acute Care/Trauma surgery intervention for hemorrhage. Thirteen patients required damage control packing during their hospitalization. Blood loss averaged 6.8±5.5 L and patients received a total of 21±14 units during deliveries with hemorrhage. There were 17 other surgical interventions not related to hemorrhage; seven of these cases were related to adhesions or intestinal injury. Seven additional cases required evaluation post routine OB/GYN procedure; the most common reason was for severe wound complications. There were three deaths during this study period. Emergency OB/GYN cases are associated with high morbidity and may require damage control or other surgical techniques in cases of overwhelming hemorrhage. Acute Care/Trauma Surgeons have a key role in the treatment of these complex cases."

This bibliometric analysis aimed to identify the 100 most cited articles in Emergency Abdominal Surgery (EAS), to highlight key areas of interest and identify those that have most significantly shaped contemporary clinical practice in this newly evolving surgical specialty. This is of increasing relevance as concerns grow regarding the variable and suboptimal outcomes in Emergency General Surgery. The Thomson Reuters Web of Science database was used to search using the terms [Emergency AND Abdom* AND Surg*] to identify all English language, full manuscripts. Results were ranked according to citation number. The top 100 articles were further analysed by subject, author, journal, year of publication, institution, and country of origin. The median (range) citation number of the top 100 out of 7433 eligible papers was 131 (1569-97). The most cited paper (by Goldman et al., Massachusetts General Hospital, New England Journal of Medicine; 1569 citations) focused on cardiac risk stratification in non-cardiac surgery. The Journal of Trauma, Injury, Infection and Critical Care published the most papers and received most citations (n = 19; 2954 citations. The majority of papers were published by centres in the USA (n = 52; 9422 citations), followed by the UK (n = 13; 1816 citations). The most common topics of publication concerned abdominal aneurysm management (n = 26) and emergency gastrointestinal surgery (n = 26). Vascular surgery, risk assessment and gastrointestinal surgery were the areas of focus for 59% of the contemporary most cited emergency abdominal surgery manuscripts.

However, the critical role of ACS in the rescue of patients with a surgical complication has not been explored. We here describe the role of \"surgical rescue\" in the practice of ACS. A prospective, electronic medical record-based ACS registry spanning January 2013 to May 2014 at a large urban academic medical center was screened by ICD-9 codes for acute surgical complications of an operative or interventional procedure. Long-term outcomes were derived from the Social Security Death Index. Of 2,410 ACS patients, 320 (13%) required \"surgical rescue\": most commonly, from wound complications (32%), uncontrolled sepsis (19%), and acute obstruction (15%). The majority of complications (85%) were related to an operation; 15% were related to interventional procedures. The most common rescue interventions required were bowel resection (23%), wound debridement (18%), and source control of infection (17%); 63% of patients required operative intervention, and 22% required surgical critical care. Thirty-six percent of complications occurred in ACS primary patients (\"local\"), whereas 38% were referred from another surgical service (\"institutional\") and 26% referred from another institution (\"regional\"). Hospital length of stay was longer, and in-hospital and 1-year mortalities were higher in rescue patients compared with those without a complication. Outcomes were equivalent between \"local\" and \"institutional\" patients, but hospital length of stay and discharge to home were significantly worse in \"institutional\" referrals. We here describe the distinct role of the acute care surgeon in the surgical management of complications; this is an additional pillar of ACS. In this vital role, the acute care surgeon provides crucial support to other providers as well as direct patient care in the \"surgical rescue\" of surgical and procedural complications.

To identify hospital factors associated with care discontinuity among EGS patients. We performed a retrospective analysis of the 100% Medicare inpatient claims file, from January 1, 2008, to November 30, 2011, and matched patient details to hospital information in the 2011 American Hospital Association Annual Survey database. We selected patients aged 65 years and older who had the most common procedures associated with the previously defined American Association for the Surgery of Trauma EGS diagnosis categories and survived to hospital discharge across the United States. The current analysis was conducted from February 1, 2016, to March 24, 2016. Care discontinuity defined as readmission within 30 days to nonindex hospitals. There were 109 443 EGS patients readmitted within 30 days of discharge and 20 396 (18.6%) were readmitted to nonindex hospitals. Of the readmitted patients, 61 340 (56%) were female. Care discontinuity was higher among patients who were male (19.5% vs 18.0%), those younger than 85 years old (19.0% vs 16.6%), and those who lived 12.8 km (8 miles) or more away from the index hospitals (23.7% vs 14.8%) (all P < .001). Care discontinuity was independently associated with mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.16; 95% CI, 1.08-1.25). Hospital factors associated with care discontinuity included bed size of 200 or more (aOR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.36-1.54), safety-net status (aOR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.27-1.43), and teaching status (aOR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.09-1.28). Care discontinuity was significantly lower among designated trauma centers (aOR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83-0.94) and highest among hospitals in the Midwest (aOR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.05-1.26). Nearly 1 in 5 older EGS patients is readmitted to a hospital other than where their original procedure was performed. This care discontinuity is independently associated with mortality and is highest among EGS patients who are treated at large, teaching, safety-net hospitals. These data underscore the need for sustained efforts in increasing continuity of care among these hospitals and highlight the importance of accounting for these factors in risk-adjusted hospital comparisons."

The aim of this study is to quantify outcomes for EGS patients with cancer. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2007 to 2011) was queried for patients with a diagnosis of an EGS condition as determined by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma. Of these, patients with a diagnosis of malignant cancers (ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes; 140-208.9, 238.4, 289.8) were identified. Patients with and without cancer were matched across baseline characteristics using propensity-scores. Outcome measures included all-cause mortality, complications, failure-to-rescue, length of stay, and cost. Multivariable logistic regression analyses further adjusted for hospital characteristics and volume. Analysis of 3,625,906 EGS patients revealed an 8.9% prevalence of concurrent malignancies. The most common EGS conditions in cancer patients included gastro-intestinal bleeding (24.8%), intestinal obstruction (13.5%), and peritonitis (10.7%). EGS patients with cancer universally had higher odds of complications (odds ratio [OR] 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20 [1.19 to 1.21]), mortality (OR [95% CI]: 2.00 [1.96 to 2.04]), failure-to-rescue (OR [95% CI]: 1.52 [1.48 to 1.56]), and prolonged hospital stay (OR [95% CI]: 1.69 [1.67 to 1.70]).

Limited information exists regarding the contribution of malnutrition to the outcome of critically ill patients who undergo EGS. We hypothesized that malnutrition would be associated with increased risk of 90-day all-cause mortality following intensive care unit (ICU) admission in EGS patients. We performed an observational study of patients treated in medical and surgical ICUs at a single institution in Boston. We included patients who underwent an EGS procedure and received critical care between 2005 and 2011. The exposure of interest, malnutrition, was determined by a registered dietitian's formal assessment within 48 hours of ICU admission. The primary outcome was all-cause 90-day mortality. Adjusted odds ratios were estimated by multivariable logistic regression models. The cohort consisted of 1361 patients. Sixty percent had nonspecific malnutrition, 8% had protein-energy malnutrition, and 32% were without malnutrition. The 30-day readmission rate was 18.9%. Mortality in-hospital and at 90 days was 10.1% and 17.9%, respectively. Patients with nonspecific malnutrition had a 1.5-fold increased odds of 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-5.04; P = .009) and patients with protein-energy malnutrition had a 3.1-fold increased odds of 90-day mortality (adjusted OR, 3.06; 95% CI, 1.89-4.92; P < .001) compared with patients without malnutrition. In critically ill patients who undergo EGS, malnutrition at ICU admission is predictive of adverse outcomes. In survivors of hospitalization, malnutrition at ICU admission is associated with increases in readmission and mortality."

A major complication occurred in 537/1139 (47%) of all patients within 30 days of surgery. Unadjusted 30-day mortality was 20.2% and 1-year mortality was 34%. One hundred and thirty-seven of 230 (60%) deaths occurred between 72 h and 30 days after surgery; all of these patients had complications, indicating that there is a prolonged period with a high frequency of complications and mortality after emergency laparotomy. We conclude that peri-operative, enhanced recovery care bundles for preventing complications should extend their focus on continuous complication detection and rescue beyond the first few postoperative days."

Recently, the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) proposed an anatomic severity grading system. We aimed to validate this system in patients with appendicitis and determine if cross-sectional imaging correlates with disease severity at operation. Patients 18 years or older undergoing treatment for acute appendicitis between 2013 and 2015 were identified. Baseline demographics, procedure types were recorded, and AAST grades were assigned based on intraoperative and radiologic findings. Outcomes including length of stay, 30-day mortality, and complications based on Clavien-Dindo categories and National Surgical Quality Improvement Program variables. Summary statistical univariate, nominal logistic, and standard least squares analyses were performed comparing AAST grade with key outcomes. Bland-Altman analysis compared operative findings with preoperative cross-sectional imaging to compare assigning grades. Three hundred thirty-four patients with mean (±SD) age of 39.3 years (±16.5) were included (53% men), and all patients had cross-sectional imaging. Two hundred ninety-nine underwent appendectomy, and 85% completed laparoscopic. Thirty-day mortality rate was 0.9%, complication rate was 21%. Increased (median [interquartile range, IQR]) AAST grade was recorded in patients with complications (2 [1-4]) compared with those without (1 [1-1], p = 0.001). For operative management, (median [IQR]) AAST grades were significantly associated with procedure type: laparoscopic (1 [1-1]), open (4 [2-5]), conversion to open (3 [1-4], p = 0.001). Increased (median [IQR]) AAST grades were significantly associated in nonoperative management: patients having a complication had a higher median AAST grade (4 [3-5]) compared with those without (3 [2-3], p = 0.001). Bland-Altman analysis comparing AAST grade and cross-sectional imaging demonstrated no difference (-0.02 ± 0.02; p = 0.2; coefficient of repeatability 0.9). The AAST grading system is valid in our population. Increased AAST grade is associated with open procedures, complications, and length of stay. The AAST emergency general surgery grade determined by preoperative imaging strongly correlated to operative findings. Epidemiologic/prognostic study, level III."

Emergency general surgery attendings and surgical residents in or beyond their third year of training at a single tertiary care academic hospital from January to July 2014. Surgeons responded to the surprise question within 72 hours of evaluating patients, ≥65 years, hospitalized with an acute surgical condition. Patient data, including demographic and clinical characteristics, were extracted from the medical record. Mortality within 12 months of initial evaluation was determined by using Social Security death data. Ten attending surgeons and 18 surgical residents provided 163 responses to the surprise question for 119 patients: 60% of responses were \"No, I would not be surprised\" and 40% were \"Yes, I would be surprised.\" A \"No\" response was associated with increased odds of death within 12 months in binary logistic regression (OR 4.8 [95% CI 2.1-11.1]). The surprise question is a valuable tool for identifying older patients with higher risk of death, and it may be a useful screening criterion for older emergency general surgery patients who would benefit from palliative care evaluation."

We hypothesized that the majority of ACS fellowship graduates would be practicing ACS in academic Level I trauma centers and that fellowship training was pivotal in their career. Graduates of American Association for the Surgery of Trauma-certified ACS fellowships completed an online survey that included practice demographics, specific categories of cases delineated by the current ACS curriculum, and perceived impact of training. Surveys were submitted by 56 of 77 graduates for a completion rate of 73%. The majority of respondents were male (68%) aged 40 years or younger (80%). All but four completed ACS fellowship training in last 5 years (93%), and 83% completed fellowship in the last 3 years. Regarding their current practice, broadly defined ACS predominated (96%) with 2% practicing only trauma surgery and 2% only general surgery. Practice settings were 64% urban, 29% suburban, and 7% rural locations, with 84% of graduates practicing in a hospital-based group. The practitioner's hospital was identified as university/university-affiliated in 53%, community in 38%, and military in 9%, with 91% identified as a teaching hospital; trauma designation was identified as Level I (55%), Level II (39%), and other (6%). The graduates' average current practice mix is 10% elective general surgery, 29% emergency general surgery, 32% trauma, 25% surgical critical care, and 4% other (burn, bariatric, vascular, and thoracic). Only 16% of graduates do not perform elective cases. Case specifics demonstrated 92% of graduates perform vascular cases, 88% perform thoracic cases, and 70% perform complex hepatobiliary. Practice elements that were satisfiers included (1) scope of practice, (2) case mix, (3) percentage emergency general surgery, (4) lifestyle, (5) case complexity (with 3 and 4 tied). Graduates agreed the ACS fellowship training prepared them well for practice and was worth the time invested (both 82%), increased their marketability and self-confidence (80%), and prepared them well for academics (71%) and administration (63%). Of those surveyed, 93% would encourage others to do an ACS fellowship. Although 93% of graduates practice in urban/suburban areas, there was a mixture of university, university-affiliated, and community institutions and an almost even division of Levels I and II designation. Graduates demonstrate ongoing use of their acquired advanced operative training, particularly in vascular and thoracic surgery. The majority of ACS fellowship graduates were practicing ACS and felt fellowship training was valuable in their career path and that they would recommend it to others."

    "abstract": "Acute-care surgery (ACS), trauma, and surgical critical care (SCC) fellowships graduate fellows deemed qualified to perform complex cases immediately upon graduation. We hypothesize international fellow rotations can be a resource to supplement operative case exposure. A survey was sent to all program directors (PDs) of ACS and SCC fellowships via e-mail. Data were captured and analyzed using the REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) tool. The survey was sent to 113 PDs, with a response rate of 42%. Most fellows performed less than 150 operative cases (59.5%). The majority of PDs thought the operative exposure either could be improved or was not enough to ensure expertise in trauma and emergent general surgery. Only a minority of the PDs found their case load exceptional (can be improved: 43%, not enough: 30% exceptional: 27%). Most PDs thought an international experience could supplement the breadth of cases, provide research opportunities, and improve understanding of trauma systems (70%). Ten sites offered international rotations (70%). Most fellowships would be willing to provide reciprocity to the host institution (90%). The majority of PDs for ACS, trauma, and SCC programs perceive a need for increased quality and quantity of operative cases. The majority recognize international fellow rotations as a valuable tool to supplement fellows' education."

    "abstract": "Acute care surgeons (ACS) often care for patients with limited access to health care. They may not participate in preventative screenings and interventions (PSIs) such as mammography, colonoscopy, or pneumococcal vaccinations (VAs). We sought to identify barriers to compliance and determine if ACS have an opportunity to facilitate PSI participation. All patients evaluated by an ACS were considered for inclusion in the study. Patients meeting national PSI inclusion criteria were enrolled. Surveys were administered to assess compliance and identify barriers to participation. The overall compliance rate with PSIs was 57%. Patients without a primary care physician had a compliance rate of 23%. The most common barrier to participation was lack of knowledge of PSI recommendations (42%). Males were less compliant than females (47% vs 62%). ACS evaluate a large number of general surgery and trauma patients. The acute care surgeon-patient encounter represents a valuable opportunity for education and improved PSI compliance. Additional research should focus on developing interventional strategies and evaluating their impact on patient outcomes."

Using data from the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative, we selected patients with procedure codes for open or laparoscopic appendectomy with a diagnosis of acute appendicitis (2006 to 2011). We used multivariate regression models for risk adjustment of patient-level factors and reliability adjustment for sample size differences between hospitals. Adjusted rates of outcomes for each hospital were generated by multiplying ratios of observed to expected events by overall mean event rates. During the study period, 12,410 patients underwent appendectomies in 49 participating Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative hospitals. Neither the mortality rate nor the rate of superficial or deep surgical site infection demonstrated significant variation. However, significant variation was observed for all other clinical outcomes, including a 14-fold difference of the rate of postoperative sepsis and septic shock. We found significant hospital variation in outcomes after appendectomy and identified missing variables that could help to explain the observed variation. These findings have been used to enhance ongoing quality improvement efforts across the state of Michigan."

We performed matched retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing operative intervention at night by acute care surgeons over 16 months. Cases were matched on case complexity, age, and sex to daytime cases. Other confounders including comorbidities, presenting characteristics, complications, and mortality were abstracted. Outcomes differences between day and night cases were compared. Night cases (115) were matched 1:1 to daytime cases. Groups had similar degrees of comorbidity. Those operated at night had trends toward more hypotension and sepsis. After controlling for confounders using conditional logistic regression, surgical care at night was a potent predictor of mortality (odds ratio 30.02; 95% CI 2.33 to 387.40; P = .009) but had little impact on morbidity (odds ratio 1.34; 95% CI .77 to 2.36; P = .303). Emergency operations performed at night by acute care surgeons may have dissimilar outcomes compared with day cases."

Our objective was to develop a preoperative scoring tool to quantify risk of 1-year mortality. Three hundred ninety EGS patients aged 70 years or more were analyzed. Risk factors for 1-year mortality were identified using stepwise-forward logistic multivariate regression and weights assigned using natural logarithm of odds ratios. A geriatric emergency surgery mortality (GEM) score was derived from the aggregate of weighted scores. Leave-one-out cross-validation was performed. One-year mortality was 32%. Risk factors and their weights were: acute kidney injury (2), American Society of Anesthesiology class greater than or equal to 4 (2), Charlson Comorbidity Index greater than or equal to 4 (1), albumin less than 3.5 mg/dL (1), and body mass index (less than 18.5 kg/m2 [1]; 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 [0]; ≥30 kg/m2 [-1]). One-year mortality was: GEM 0 to 1 (0% to 7%); GEM 2 to 5 (32% to 68%); GEM 6 to 8 (94% to 100%). C-statistics were .82 and .75 in training and validation data sets, respectively. A simple score using 5 clinical variables predicts 1-year mortality after EGS with reasonable accuracy and assists in preoperative counseling."

Our objective was to determine the relationship between insurance status and disease complexity at presentation among a national sample of emergency general surgical patients. Data from the National Emergency Department Sample from 2006-2009 were queried to identify all patients aged 18-64 years old admitted through the emergency department with a primary diagnosis of appendicitis, diverticulitis, inguinal hernia, or bowel obstruction. Primary outcome of complex presentation was defined as also presenting with generalized peritonitis, intra-abdominal abscess, perforated bowel, intestinal gangrene, or other disease-specific measures of complexity. We used multivariable logistic regression to determine the independent association between insurance status and complex presentation. Models accounted for patient- and hospital-level covariates. Counterfactual models were used to estimate the risk of complex presentation attributable to lack of insurance. A total of 1,373,659 patients were included, with an overall uninsured rate of 12.3%. Uninsured patients had significantly higher, unadjusted rates of complex presentation, and uninsured payer status was independently associated with complex presentation (odds ratio 1.38, 95% confidence interval: 1.34-1.42). Counterfactual models suggest that having insurance would result in a 22.37% (95% confidence interval: 22.35-22.39%) relative decline in risk of complex emergency general surgical presentation among the uninsured population. Insurance status is independently associated with severity of disease at presentation among emergency general surgical conditions nationally. In light of recently reaffirmed Affordable Care Act insurance expansion provisions, these results anticipate increased timely access to operative care for newly insured patients and a corresponding decline in complex, emergency general surgical presentations."

    "abstract": "There are no specific Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education General Surgery Residency Program Requirements for rotations in surgical critical care (SCC), trauma, and burn. We sought to determine the experience of general surgery residents in SCC, trauma, and burn rotations. Data analysis of surgical rotations of American Board of Surgery general surgery resident applicants (n = 7,299) for the last 8 years (2006 to 2013, inclusive) was performed through electronic applications to the American Board of Surgery Qualifying Examination. Duration (months) spent in SCC, trauma, and burn rotations, and postgraduate year (PGY) level were examined. The total months in SCC, trauma and burn rotations was mean 10.2 and median 10.0 (SD 3.9 months), representing approximately 16.7% (10 of 60 months) of a general surgery resident's training. However, there was great variability (range 0 to 29 months). SCC rotation duration was mean 3.1 and median 3.0 months (SD 2, min to max: 0 to 15), trauma rotation duration was mean 6.3 and median 6.0 months (SD 3.5, min to max: 0 to 24), and burn rotation duration was mean 0.8 and median 1.0 months (SD 1.0, min to max: 0 to 6). Of the total mean 10.2 months duration, the longest exposure was 2 months as PGY-1, 3.4 months as PGY-2, 1.9 months as PGY-3, 2.2 months as PGY-4 and 1.1 months as PGY-5. PGY-5 residents spent a mean of 1 month in SCC, trauma, and burn rotations. PGY-4/5 residents spent the majority of this total time in trauma rotations, whereas junior residents (PGY-1 to 3) in SCC and trauma rotations. There is significant variability in total duration of SCC, trauma, and burn rotations and PGY level in US general surgery residency programs, which may result in significant variability in the fund of knowledge and clinical experience of the trainee completing general surgery residency training. As acute care surgery programs have begun to integrate emergency general surgery with SCC, trauma, and burn rotations, it is an ideal time to determine the optimal curriculum and duration of these important rotations for general surgery residency training."

Changes in training and decline in operative trauma have decreased trainees' exposure to these injuries. We sought to determine how frequently vascular procedures are performed at US trauma centers to quantify the need for general surgeons trained to manage vascular injuries. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the National Trauma Data Base (NTDB) from 2012 compared with 2002. Patients with general surgical and vascular procedures were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, procedure codes 38.0-39.99, excluding 38.9-38.99. General surgery or vascular operations were performed on 12,099 (24%) of 50,248 severely injured adult patients in 2002 and 21,854 (16%) of 138,009 injured patients in 2012. Nineteen percent to 26% of all patients underwent vascular procedures. Patients with combined general surgery and vascular procedures were less likely to be discharged home and more likely to die. In 2002, 6% of severely injured adult trauma patients underwent open vascular procedures at level III/IV trauma centers; by 2012, only 1% of vascular surgery procedures were performed at level III/IV centers (P < 0.001). Need for emergent vascular surgery remains common for severely injured patients. Future trauma systems and surgical training programs will need to account for the need for open vascular skills. The findings suggest that there is already a trend away from open vascular procedures at level III/IV trauma centers, which may be a sign of system compensation for changes in the workforce."

The goal of this study was to determine whether perioperative practices vary among surgeons for emergency Hartmann's procedures and whether perioperative care practices are associated with hospitals' complication rates. We conducted a survey of surgeons at 27 Michigan hospitals. Questionnaires focused on preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care practices. Hospitals were divided into quartiles of risk-adjusted complication rates. Responses of surgeons at hospitals with the lowest complication rates were compared to those with the highest, to determine whether there were systematic differences. Qualitative content analysis was performed for open-ended questions. A total of 106 surgeons returned questionnaires (response rate 49%). We identified variation in use of bowel preparation, ostomy site marking, rectal stump management, ostomy protrusion, skin closure method, antibiotics duration, and ambulation/physical therapy practices. Surgeons from hospitals with low complication rates were more likely to use a clean instrument tray during wound closure (61% versus 11%, P = 0.001) and reported greater use of laparoscopic lavage without resection for emergency diverticulitis cases (31% versus 6%, P = 0.05). Surgeons in the lower complication rate hospitals listed more modifiable care factors in their open-ended responses to questions about reasons for complications. Surgeons' practices vary for emergency Hartmann's procedure. This study serves as a proof of concept that studying surgeons' practices is feasible within a quality collaborative setting. Such data can be used to generate testable hypotheses for performance improvement aimed in high-risk, emergency surgery."

Reports on all surgery-related cases appraised by the Taiwan Witness Examiner Committee of the Department of Health between 2004 and 2008 were reviewed retrospectively by three senior physicians from the emergency department who specialize in both trauma and emergency general surgery. The causes of the various medical disputes were categorized under the following descriptions: operation- or procedure-related complication, anesthesia complication, inappropriate management or decision, delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis, and unsatisfactory result. A total of 154 cases were reviewed, of which 39 were trauma-related and 115 were disease-related. The two leading causes of disputes in this review were found to be operation- or procedure-related complications (35.7%) and unsatisfactory results (31.8%), followed by delayed diagnoses or misdiagnoses, inappropriate management, and anesthesia complications. Among these, 74 cases (48.1%) required the care of an acute care surgeon and 40 cases (26.0%) required emergency general surgery intervention. Surgery- or procedure-related complications and unsatisfactory treatment results constituted the major causes of medical disputes in Taiwan. The majority of these cases involved acute care surgery; thus, the establishment of an acute care surgery system should be considered to improve patient care. The management of hemorrhagic shock and incarcerated hernia should be reinforced in future medical training."

The aim of the study was to analyse the current Italian practice on the use of laparoscopy in abdominal emergencies and to evaluate the impact of the 2012 national guidelines on the daily surgical activity. Two surveys (42 closed-ended questions) on the use of laparoscopy in acute abdomen were conducted nationwide with an online questionnaire, respectively, before (2010) and after (2014) the national guidelines publication. Data from two surveys were compared using Chi-square or Fisher's exact test, and data were considered significant when p < 0.05. Two-hundred and one and 234 surgical units answered to the surveys in 2010 and 2014, respectively. Out of 144,310 and 127,013 overall surgical procedures, 23,407 and 20,102, respectively, were abdominal emergency operations. Respectively 24.74 % (in 2010) versus 30.27 % (in 2014) of these emergency procedures were approached laparoscopically, p = 0.42. The adoption of laparoscopy increased in all the considered clinical scenarios, with statistical significance in acute appendicitis (44 vs. 64.7 %; p = 0.004). The percentage of units approaching Hinchey III acute diverticulitis with laparoscopy in 26-75 % of cases (14.0 vs. 29.7 %; p = 0.009), those with >25 % of surgeons confident with laparoscopic approach to acute diverticulitis (29.9 vs. 54 %; p = 0.0009), the units with >50 % of surgeons confident with laparoscopic approach to acute appendicitis, cholecystitis and perforated duodenal ulcer, all significantly increased in the time frame. The majority of respondents declared that the 2012 national guidelines influenced their clinical practice. The surveys showed an increasing use of laparoscopy for patients with abdominal emergencies. The 2012 national guidelines profoundly influenced the Italian surgical practice in the laparoscopic approach to the acute abdomen."

Although acknowledging the importance of physiological and comorbid parameters, these factors were not included in the developed system. Thus, we sought to validate the AAST-SBO scoring system and evaluate the effect of adding patient's physiology and comorbidity on the prediction for the proposed system. Patients aged ≥18 y who were treated for SBO at our institution between 2009 and 2012 were identified. The physiology and comorbidity as well as the AAST anatomic scores were determined, squared, and added to calculate the score that we termed Acute General Emergency Surgical Severity-Small Bowel Obstruction (AGESS-SBO). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve analyses were performed for the AAST anatomic score and compared with the AGESS-SBO score as a predictor for inhospital mortality, extended hospital stay, and inhospital complications. A total of 351 patients with mean age of 66 ± 17 years were identified, of whom 145 (41%) underwent operation to treat bowel obstruction. Extended hospital stay (>9 d) occurred in 86 patients (25%), inhospital complications in 73 (21%), and inhospital mortality in eight patients (2%). The median (interquartile range [IQR]) AAST anatomic score was 1 point (IQR: 1-2), physiology score was 0 point (IQR: 0-1), and comorbidity score was 1 point (IQR: 1-3); for overall median AGESS-SBO score of 5 points (IQR: 3-13). The AUROC curve analyses demonstrated that the AGESS-SBO system with measures of presenting physiology, comorbidities in addition to AAST anatomic criteria could be beneficial in predicting key outcomes including inhospital mortality (AUROC curve: 0.80 versus 0.54, P = 0.03). The AAST anatomic score is a reliable system, which assists care providers to categorize SBO. Adding physiology and comorbidity parameters to the described anatomic criteria can be helpful in predicting the outcomes including mortality. Further studies evaluating its usefulness in research and quality improvement purposes across institutions are still required."

Data for emergency general surgical admissions to National Health Service hospitals in the Northern Deanery in England between 2000 and 2014 were collected, including demographics, co-morbidities, diagnoses, operations undertaken and outcomes. The primary outcome of interest was in-hospital death within 30 days of admission. Cox regression analysis was undertaken with adjustment for co-variables. There were 12 100 in-hospital deaths within 30 days of admission (3·3 per cent). The overall 30-day mortality rate reduced significantly during the 15-year interval studied, from 5·4 per cent (2000-2004) to 4·0 per cent (2005-2009) and 2·9 per cent during 2010-2014 (P < 0·001). There was no significant mortality difference for patients admitted at the weekend in adjusted Cox models (hazard ratio (HR) 1·00 for Saturday and 0·90 for Sunday, versus Wednesday). There was a significantly higher mortality for operations undertaken at the weekend (HR 1·15 for Saturday and 1·40 for Sunday; P = 0·021 and P < 0·001 respectively). The significantly increased mortality that was evident for emergency surgery at the weekend compared with weekdays in 2000-2004 (HR 1·46 for Saturday and 1·55 for Sunday; both P < 0·001); had reduced by 2010-2014, when the adjusted mortality risk was not significant (HR 1·18 for Saturday and 1·12 for Sunday). During the past 15 years there has been a weekend effect in patients undergoing emergency general surgery based on day of operation, but not day of admission. Overall mortality for emergency general surgery has improved significantly, and in the past 5 years the increased mortality risk of weekend surgery has reduced."

Unfortunately care for EGS patients is often fragmented and important care processes are frequently omitted. This study aimed to define a group of important processes during EGS admission and assess their reliability. Literature review and semi-structured interviews were used to define a draft list of processes, which was refined and validated using the Delphi consensus methodology. A prospective cohort study of the 22 included processes was performed in 315 patients across 5 acute hospitals. Prospective study of the 22 selected processes demonstrated omission of 1130/5668 (19.9%) processes. Only 6 (1.9%) patients had all relevant processes performed correctly. Administration of oxygen to hypoxic patients (82/129, 64%), consultant review (202/313, 65%) and administration of antibiotics within 3 h for patients with severe sepsis (41/60, 68%) were performed particularly poorly. There were significant differences in the mean number of omissions per patient between hospitals ( F = 11.008, p < 0.001) and this was strongly correlated with hospitals' median length of stay (Spearman's rho = 0.975, p = 0.005). Reliability of admissions processes in this study was poor, with significant variability between hospitals. It is likely that improvements in process reliability would enhance EGS patients' outcomes. This will require engagement of the entire surgical team and the implementation of multiple interventions to improve the effectiveness of the admission phase of care."

    "abstract": "The last 15 years have seen changing patterns of injury in emergency surgery and trauma patients. The ability to diagnose, treat and manage these patients nonoperatively has led to a decline in interest in trauma surgery as a career. In addition, healthcare systems face multiple challenges, including limited resources, an ageing population and increasing subspecialisation of medical care, while maintaining government-directed standards and managing public expectations. In the West, these challenges have led to the emergence of a new subspecialty, 'acute care surgery', with some models of care providing dedicated acute surgical units or separating acute and elective streams with the existing manpower resources. The outcomes for emergency surgery patients and efficiency gains are promising. In Singapore, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital has implemented its first dedicated acute surgical unit.

This pilot study evaluated the impact of EGS modules aimed at StRs over 1 year. Methods Eleven StRs were allocated a focused 4-week EGS module, in addition to the standard 1:12 on-call duty rota, in a tertiary surgical centre. Primary outcome measures included the number of indicative emergency operations and validated Procedure Based Assessments (PBAs) performed, both during the EGS module and over the training year. Results StRs performed a median of 11 (range 5-15) laparotomies during the EGS module versus 31 (range 9-49) over the whole training year. StRs attended 43.7% of available laparotomies during the module (range 24.1-63.7%). EGS modules provided more than one-third of the total emergency laparotomy experience, and a quarter of the emergency colectomy, appendicectomy and Hartmann's procedure experience. There were no differences in EGS module-related outcomes between junior and senior StRs. Significantly more PBAs related to laparotomy and segmental colectomy were completed during EGS modules than the on-call duty rota, at 32% versus 14% (p<0.001) and 48% versus 22% (p=0.019), respectively. Performance levels were maintained following module completion. Conclusions These findings provide an important baseline when considering future modular EGS training."

The aim of our study was to validate a modified 15-variable EGS-specific frailty index (EGSFI). We prospectively collected geriatric (age older than 65 years) EGS patients for 2 years. Postoperative complications were collected. Frailty index was calculated for 200 patients based on their preadmission condition using 50-variable modified Rockwood frailty index. Emergency general surgery-specific frailty index was developed based on the regression model for complications and the most significant factors in the frailty index. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to determine cutoff for frail status. We validated our results using 60 patients for predicting complications. A total of 260 patients (developing, 200; validation, 60) were enrolled in this study. Mean age was 71 ± 11 years, and 33% developed complications. Most common complications were pneumonia (12%), urinary tract infection (9%), and wound infection (7%). Univariate analysis identified 15 variables significantly associated with complications that were used to develop the EGSFI. A cutoff frailty score of 0.325 was identified using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for frail status. Sixty patients (frail, 18; nonfrail, 42) were enrolled in the validation cohort. Frail patients were more likely to have postoperative complications (47% vs. 20%; p < 0.001) compared to nonfrail patients. Frail status based on EGSFI was a significant predictor of postoperative complications (odds ratio, 7.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-19.8; p = 0.006). Age was not associated with postoperative complications (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-1.06; p = 0.86). The 15-variable validated EGSFI is a simple and reliable bedside tool to determine the frailty status of patients undergoing EGS. Frail status as determined by the EGSFI is an independent predictor of postoperative complications and mortality in geriatric EGS patients. Prognostic study, level II."

    "abstract": "Damage control surgery (DCS) was developed to manage exsanguinating trauma patients, but is increasingly applied to the management of peritoneal sepsis and abdominal catastrophes. Few manuscripts compare the outcomes of these surgeries on disparate patient populations. A multi-institutional three group propensity score matched case cohort study comparing penetrating trauma (PT-DCS), blunt trauma (BT-DCS), and intraperitoneal sepsis (IPS-DCS) was performed comparing patients treated with DSC between 2008 and 2013. Propensity scoring was performed using demographic and presenting physiologic data. Four hundred and twelve patients were treated with DCS across two institutions. Propensity matching for age, gender, and initial Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score 80 identified 80 patients per group for comparison. Rate of primary fascial closure was lowest in the IPS-DCS group, and highest in the penetrating trauma DCS group. Intra-abdominal complication rates were highest in the IPS-DCS group. IPS-DCS had increased time to definitive closure compared with the other two groups (RR 1.8; 1.3-2.2; P < 0.03). Mortality at 90 days was highest in the IPS-DCS group and patients whose definitive closure was delayed >eight days were more than twice the risk of death at 90 days across all groups. (RR 2.15; 1.2-3.5; P < 0.002). Expected outcomes after the use of DCS for trauma and emergency general surgery are quite different. Despite this difference, prompt abdominal closure at the earliest possible opportunity afforded the best outcome in patients managed via DCS."

    "abstract": "Penetrating cardiac injuries are infrequent but highly lethal. To address these injuries, cardiopulmonary bypass and cardiothoracic surgery availability are required for Level I trauma center verification. However, acute care surgeons are more readily available for this time-sensitive injury. The purpose of this study was to review an acute care surgery-based experience with penetrating cardiac trauma at an urban Level 1 trauma center. Our hypothesis was that care provided solely by acute care surgeons was both safe and effective for this patient population. All patients with injuries to the 'cardiac box' following penetrating thoracic trauma were identified from 2005-2010. Demographic and injury related data were obtained. The types and location of cardiac injury, as well as patient outcomes, were determined from operative reports. 1701 patients with penetrating chest trauma were admitted during the study period. 260 patients were identified as having high-risk injuries and were included in the review. 37 patients underwent resuscitative thoracotomy, with a survival rate of 8 %. 76 patients (29 %) suffered a cardiac injury. 72 % of these patients had a preoperative FAST exam, which had a sensitivity and specificity of 56.5 and 82.5 % respectively. 82 % underwent a pericardial window, which had a positive predictive value of 81.4 %. 61 % (n = 46) of the patients with a cardiac injury survived, while the overall death rate in this cohort was 21 %. No patients in the cohort required cardiopulmonary bypass for emergent repair of cardiac injury and acute care surgeons performed all cases. Penetrating injury to the heart is highly lethal and time-sensitive. Increasingly, FAST and subxyphoid pericardial window are relied upon to make the diagnosis in patients arriving in varying stages of shock to the resuscitation room. Acute care surgeons are the most appropriate surgeons to care for these injuries and provide safe and effective care."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) patients have a disproportionate burden of death and complications. Chronic liver disease (CLD) increases the risk of complications following elective surgery. For EGS patients with CLD, long-term outcomes are unknown and risk stratification models do not reflect severity of CLD. To determine whether the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score is associated with increased risk of 90-day mortality following intensive care unit (ICU) admission in EGS patients. We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with CLD who underwent an EGS procedure based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) procedure codes and were admitted to a medical or surgical ICU within 48 hours of surgery between January 1, 1998, and September 20, 2012, at 2 academic medical centers. Chronic liver disease was identified using ICD-9 codes. Multivariable logistic regression was performed. The analysis was conducted from July 1, 2015, to January 1, 2016. The primary outcome was all-cause 90-day mortality. A total of 13 552 EGS patients received critical care; of these, 707 (5%) (mean [SD] age at hospital admission, 56.6 [14.2] years; 64% male; 79% white) had CLD and data to determine MELD score at ICU admission. The median MELD score was 14 (interquartile range, 10-20). Overall 90-day mortality was 30.1%. The adjusted odds ratio of 90-day mortality for each 10-point increase in MELD score was 1.63 (95% CI, 1.34-1.98). A decrease in MELD score of more than 3 in the 48 hours following ICU admission was associated with a 2.2-fold decrease in 90-day mortality (odds ratio = 0.46; 95% CI, 0.22-0.98). In this study, MELD score was associated with 90-day mortality following EGS in patients with CLD. The MELD score can be used as a prognostic factor in this patient population and should be used in preoperative risk prediction models and when counseling EGS patients on the risks and benefits of operative intervention."

    "abstract": "Recent studies have linked postoperative serum troponin elevation to mortality in a range of different clinical scenarios. To date, there has been no investigation into the significance of preoperative troponin elevation in emergency general surgery (EGS) patients. We define this as preoperative myocardial injury (PMI). We hypothesize that PMI seen in EGS patients may predict postoperative morbidity and mortality. Using the American College of Surgeons (ACS) National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database, we performed a retrospective review of all EGS cases between 2008 and 2014. Patients with preoperative troponin I drawn were compared. There were 464 EGS patients who had troponin I measurements preoperatively. Eighty-two (18%) had preoperative troponin elevations. Patients with PMI were more likely to have the following preoperative physiologic derangements: acute renal failure (18% vs 4%; p = 0.002) and septic shock (40% vs 13%; p < 0.001). Patient comorbidities associated with PMI included congestive heart failure (13% vs 3%; p = 0.007), dialysis dependence (16% vs 3%; p = 0.002), and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class ≥ 4 (52% vs 29%; p < 0.001). Compared with controls, patients with PMI had higher rates of postoperative events (77% vs 52%; p < 0.001) and mortality (34% vs 13%; p = 0.009). Univariate analysis showed that patients with PMI had an increased risk of postoperative events (odds ratio [OR] 3.02; 95% CI 1.74 to 5.25) and mortality (OR 3.53; 95% CI 1.66 to 7.47). Multivariate analysis revealed preoperative troponin I elevation was an independent predictor of mortality (OR 3.03; 95% CI 1.19 to 7.72, p = 0.020). Emergency general surgery patients with PMI are at increased risk for postoperative events and death. Preoperative myocardial injury is an independent predictor of mortality and has prognostic utility that can prepare surgical teams for adverse events so that they can be recognized, evaluated, and treated earlier."

    "abstract": "Trauma centers (TCs) have been demonstrated to improve outcomes for some nontrauma surgical conditions, such as appendicitis, but it remains unclear if this extends to all emergency general surgery procedures. Using emergent colectomy in patients with diverticulitis as index condition, this study compared outcomes between TCs and nontrauma centers (NTCs). The Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (2006-2011) was queried for patients ≥16 y with diverticulitis who underwent emergency surgical intervention. Outcomes included mortality, total charges, and length of stay (LOS). Mortality in TC and NTC was compared using logistic regression, controlling for patient, procedure, and hospital-level characteristics. Adjusted total charges and LOS were analyzed using generalized linear models with gamma and Poisson distributions, respectively. A total of 25,396 patients were included, 5189 (20.4%) were treated at TC and 20,207 (79.6%) at NTC. Median age and sex distribution were similar. Unadjusted proportional in-hospital mortality did not differ between TC and NTC; median charges and LOS were greater in TC. After adjusting, the odds of mortality were significantly higher in TC (odds ratio [OR], 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.51; P = 0.003) as were mean charges and LOS (P < 0.001). The improved outcomes reported for other nontrauma conditions in TC were not observed for patients undergoing an emergent colectomy for diverticulitis after accounting for patient, procedure, and hospital-level characteristics. Future research is needed to assess differences in case mix between TC versus NTC and possible case-mix effects on outcomes to elucidate potential benefit of surgical care in a TC across the breadth of emergency general surgery conditions."

However, there is currently no established definition of the EGS procedures. To define a set of procedures accounting for at least 80% of the national burden of operative EGS. A retrospective review was conducted using data from the 2008-2011 National Inpatient Sample. Adults (age, ≥18 years) with primary EGS diagnoses consistent with the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma definition, admitted urgently or emergently, who underwent an operative procedure within 2 days of admission were included in the analyses. Procedures were ranked to account for national mortality and complication burden. Among ranked procedures, contributions to total EGS frequency, mortality, and hospital costs were assessed. The data query and analysis were performed between November 15, 2015, and February 16, 2016. Overall procedure frequency, in-hospital mortality, major complications, and inpatient costs calculated per 3-digit International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification procedure codes. The study identified 421 476 patient encounters associated with operative EGS, weighted to represent 2.1 million nationally over the 4-year study period. The overall mortality rate was 1.23% (95% CI, 1.18%-1.28%), the complication rate was 15.0% (95% CI, 14.6%-15.3%), and mean cost per admission was $13 241 (95% CI, $12 957-$13 525). After ranking the 35 procedure groups by contribution to EGS mortality and morbidity burden, a final set of 7 operative EGS procedures were identified, which collectively accounted for 80.0% of procedures, 80.3% of deaths, 78.9% of complications, and 80.2% of inpatient costs nationwide. These 7 procedures included partial colectomy, small-bowel resection, cholecystectomy, operative management of peptic ulcer disease, lysis of peritoneal adhesions, appendectomy, and laparotomy. Only 7 procedures account for most admissions, deaths, complications, and inpatient costs attributable to the 512 079 EGS procedures performed in the United States each year. National quality benchmarks and cost reduction efforts should focus on these common, complicated, and costly EGS procedures."

    "abstract": "Assessment of operative risk in geriatric patients undergoing emergency general surgery (EGS) is challenging. Frailty is an established measure for risk assessment in elective surgical cases. Emerging literature suggests the superiority of frailty measurements to chronological age in predicting outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess the outcomes in elderly patients undergoing EGS using an established Rockwood frailty index. We prospectively measured preadmission frailty in all geriatric (aged 65 years and older) patients undergoing EGS at our institution during a 2-year period. Frailty index (FI) was calculated using the modified 50-variable Rockwood Preadmission FI. Frail patients were defined by FI ≥ 0.25. Outcomes measures were in-hospital complications, development of major complications, and mortality. Multivariate regression analysis was performed. A total of 220 patients were enrolled, of which 82 (37%) were frail. Frailty index score did not correlate with age (R = 0.64; R(2) = 0.53; p = 0.1) and poorly correlated with American Society of Anesthesiologists score (R = 0.51; R(2) = 0.44; p = 0.045). Thirty-five percent (n = 77) of patients had postoperative complications and 19% (n = 42) had major complications. Frailty index was an independent predictor for development of in-hospital complications (odds ratio = 2.13; 95% CI, 1.09-4.16; p = 0.02) and major complications (odds ratio = 3.87; 95% CI, 1.69-8.84; p = 0.001). Age and American Society of Anesthesiologists score were not predictive of postoperative and major complications. Our FI model had 80% sensitivity, 72% specificity, and area under the curve of 0.75 in predicting complications in geriatric patients undergoing EGS. The overall mortality rate was 3.2% (n = 7) and all patients who died were frail. Frailty index independently predicts postoperative complications, major complications, and hospital length of stay in elderly patients undergoing emergency general surgery. Use of FI will provide insight into the hospital course of elderly patients, allowing for identification of patients in need and more efficient allocation of hospital resources."

The present study aims to evaluate the impact of the implementation of the academic day programme designed for undergraduate medical interns within the Mexican second level healthcare Hospital General Regional No. 6 \"Dr. Ignacio García Téllez\". A comparative and also a prospective study were applied to a sample of 56 medical interns who participated in the academic day implementation. The impact of the scheme was assessed using the notes of the different exams at the beginning and end of the medical internship. The non-parametrical Wilcoxon test was used for the statistical analysis for comparison between the initial and final notes. A positive difference was observed in the notes of the modules of internal medicine, pediatrics, gynecology, emergency, general surgery, and family medicine applied at the beginning and end of the implementation of the academic day (p=0.000). Basic guidelines should be established for educational training from an active-participative perspective as the academic day scheme; these rules should significatively increase the medical intern learning process and, as a logical consequence would have a positive influence on healthcare quality.

Based on a standardized definition of EGS, patients in the 2007 to 2011 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project-Nationwide Inpatient Sample were queried for primary EGS diagnoses. Included patients were categorized into older (≥80 years) vs younger (<80 years) adults based on a marked increase in mortality around aged 80 years. Using propensity scores, risk-adjusted differences in major morbidity, mortality, length of stay (LOS), and cost were compared. Of 3,707,465 included patients, 17.2% (n = 637,588) were ≥80 years. Relative to younger adults, older patients most frequently presented for gastrointestinal-bleeding (odds ratio [95% confidence intervals]: 2.81 [2.79 to 2.82]) and gastrostomy care (2.46 [2.39 to 2.53]). Despite higher odds of mortality (1.67 [1.63 to 1.69]), older adults exhibited lower risk-adjusted odds of morbidity (.87 [.86 to .88]), shorter LOS (4.50 vs 5.14 days), and lower total hospital costs ($10,700 vs $12,500). Octogenarian and/or nonagenarian patients present differently than younger adults. Reductions in complications, LOS, and cost among surviving older adults allude to a \"survivorship tendency\" to never give up, despite collectively higher mortality risk."

Four independent modules were provided. Surgical decision-making didactics were also included in the course curriculum. Learning gain (Δ of the rating of pre-test and post-test) was calculated for each module. An anonymous post-course satisfaction survey was also administered (16 questions with a Likert's 5-point scale of evaluation). Twenty-three MUSEC Courses were run in a 30 months period, training 416 doctors from 29 countries. A total of 52 modules were delivered. The mean pre-test and post-test grades were 8.3/12 and 10.7/12, respectively, yielding a significant mean learning gain of 28.9 % (p = 0.001). Post-course satisfaction survey got an overall ranking of 4.5/5. MUSEC is an effective and original educational format, enjoyed by candidates, that fills an educational gap for tailored US education as a procedural skill to acute care surgeons. Ongoing revisions should reduce the current limitations and increase the educational value, in terms of number of modules and post-course credentialing."

From November 2013 to February 2015, 114 AO patients were captured (REBOA, 46; open AO, 68); 80.7% were male, and 62.3% were blunt injured. Aortic occlusion occurred in the emergency department (73.7%) or the operating room (26.3%).

We hypothesized that the economic burden would be higher for EGS patients managed at TCs vs NTCs. The Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission database was queried from 2009 to 2013. The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma EGS ICD-9 codes were used to define the top 10 EGS diagnoses. Demographic characteristics, TC designation, severity of illness, and hospital charge data were collected. Differences in total charges between TCs and NTCs were analyzed by Wilcoxon test using SAS 9.3 software (SAS Institute). A total of 435,623 patients were included. Median age was 61 years (interquartile range 47 to 76 years) and 55.9% were female. Median length of stay was 4 days; 90.3% were admitted via emergency department; and overall mortality was 5.1%. Overall median charges were $11,081 for TC vs $8,264 for NTC (p < 0.0001). Minor, moderate, major, and extreme severities of illness all had higher charges at TC vs NTC with no ICU admissions, respectfully ($5,908 vs $5,243; $7,051 vs $6,003; $10,501 vs $8,777; and $23, 997 vs $18,381; p < 0.001). Care at TCs was nearly twice as expensive if patients were admitted to the ICU, even when stratifying by severity of illness. Emergency general surgery patients treated at TCs incurred increased costs compared with NTCs, independent of patient severity. These costs nearly doubled for those admitted to the ICU. As acute care surgery grows as a specialty, additional investigation is required to better understand the reasons for this cost differential."

The study examined differences in surgical outcomes among children/adolescents managed by pediatric and adult general surgery teams for emergency general surgical (EGS) conditions at a university-hospital in South Asia. Pediatric patients (<18y) admitted with an EGS diagnosis (March 2009-April 2014) were included. Patients were dichotomized by adult vs. pediatric surgical management team. Outcome measures included: length of stay (LOS), mortality, and occurrence of ≥1 complication(s). Descriptive statistics and multivariable regression analyses with propensity scores to account for potential confounding were used to compare outcomes between the two groups. Quasi-experimental counterfactual models further examined hypothetical outcomes, assuming that all patients had been treated by pediatric surgeons. A total of 2323 patients were included. Average age was 7.1y (±5.5 SD); most patients were male (77.7%). 1958 (84.3%) were managed by pediatric surgery. The overall probability of developing a complication was 1.8%; 0.9% died (all adult general surgery). Patients managed by adult general surgery had higher risk-adjusted odds of developing complications (OR [95%CI]: 5.42 [2.10-14.00]) and longer average LOS (7.98 vs. 5.61 days, p < 0.01). 39.8% fewer complications and an 8.2% decrease in LOS would have been expected if all patients had been managed by pediatric surgery. Pediatric patients had better post-operative outcomes under pediatric surgical supervision, suggesting that, where possible in resource-constrained settings, resources should be allocated to promote development and staffing of pediatric surgical specialties parallel to adult general surgical teams."

To assess this pathway, the authors conducted a prospective audit of general surgical referrals to a district general hospital in the UK. During the inclusion period 746 emergency referrals were assessed, 281 (37%) of these underwent an operation. Over a 5-month investigation period, the audit found that approximately 27% of all emergency general surgery patients requiring an operation could be managed with day case emergency surgery. This figure was maintained throughout the duration of the study. Operations included incision and drainage of abscesses, incarcerated hernia repairs and appendicectomies. The average length of stay of all surgical admissions decreased from 5 days to less than 3 days and the median time to senior review was 30 minutes. The authors have developed a pathway involving permanent members of the surgical assessment team that is sustainable over a 5-month period. The pathway has allowed rapid assessment of patients and reduced unnecessary inpatient stay in a sustainable and reproducible manner."

    "title": "Racial disparities in emergency general surgery: Do differences in outcomes persist among universally insured military patients?",
    "abstract": "Racial disparities in surgical care are well described. As many minority patients are also uninsured, increasing access to care is thought to be a viable solution to mitigate inequities. The objectives of this study were to determine whether racial disparities in 30-/90-/180- day outcomes exist within a universally insured population of military-/civilian-dependent emergency general surgery (EGS) patients and ascertain whether differences in outcomes differentially persist in care received at military versus civilian hospitals and among sponsors who are enlisted service members versus officers. It also considered longer-term outcomes of EGS care. Five years (2006-2010) of TRICARE data, which provides insurance to active/reserve/retired members of the US Armed Services and dependents, were queried for adults (≥18 years) with primary EGS conditions, defined by the AAST. Risk-adjusted survival analyses assessed race-associated differences in mortality, major acute care surgery-related morbidity, and readmission at 30/90/180 days. Models accounted for clustering within hospitals and possible biases associated with missing race using reweighted estimating equations. Subanalyses considered restricted effects among operative interventions, EGS diagnostic categories, and effect modification related to rank and military- versus civilian-hospital care. A total of 101,011 patients were included: 73.5% white, 14.5% black, 4.4% Asian, and 7.7% other. Risk-adjusted survival analyses reported a lack of worse mortality and readmission outcomes among minority patients at 30, 90, and 180 days. Major morbidity was higher among black versus white patients (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval): 30 days, 1.23 [1.13-1.35]; 90 days, 1.18 [1.09-1.28]; and 180 days, 1.15 [1.07-1.24], a finding seemingly driven by appendiceal disorders (hazard ratio, 1.69-1.70). No other diagnostic categories were significant. Variations in military- versus civilian-managed care and in outcomes for families of enlisted service members versus officers altered associations, to some extent, between outcomes and race. While an imperfect proxy of interventions is directly applicable to the broader United States, the contrast between military observations and reported racial disparities among civilian EGS patients merits consideration. Apparent mitigation of disparities among military-/civilian-dependent patients provides an example for which we as a nation and collective of providers all need to strive. The data will help to inform policy within the Department of Defense and development of disparities interventions nationwide, attesting to important differences potentially related to insurance, access to care, and military culture and values.

    "abstract": "Because preoperative risk factor modification is generally not possible in the emergency setting, complication prevention represents an important focus for quality improvement in emergency general surgery (EGS). The objective of our study was to determine the overall impact that specific postoperative complications have in this patient population. Our study sample consisted of patients from the 2012-2013 ACS-NSQIP database who underwent an EGS procedure. We used population attributable fractions (PAFs) to estimate the overall impact that each of 8 specific complications had on 30-day physiologic and resource use outcomes in our study population. The PAF represents the percentage reduction in a given outcome that would be anticipated if a complication were able to be completely prevented in our study population. Both unadjusted and risk-adjusted PAFs were calculated. There were 79,183 patients included for analysis. The most common complications in these patients were bleeding (6.2%), incisional surgical site infection (SSI) (3.4%), pneumonia (2.7%), and organ/space SSI (2.6%). Bleeding was the complication with the greatest overall impact on mortality and end-organ dysfunction, demonstrating an adjusted PAF of 10.7% (95% CI 8.2%,13.1%, p < 0.001) and 15.9% (95% CI 13.9%, 16.7%, p < 0.001) for these respective outcomes. The only other complication with a sizeable impact on these outcomes was pneumonia (adjusted PAF of 7.9% for mortality and 13.2% for pneumonia). In contrast, complications such as urinary tract infection, venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, and incisional SSI had negligible impacts on these outcomes. Our study provides a framework for the development of high-value quality initiatives in EGS."

Despite the recent emergence of this model of care, minimal research has been conducted on the quality of patient handover and no research has attempted to determine the rate of clinical agreement or disagreement among surgeons participating in these teams. A prospective cohort study was carried out with our acute care surgical service at a tertiary care teaching hospital from January 2 to March 31 2012. At the conclusion of the daily morning handover, receiving surgeons were asked to indicate, on provided handover sheets, whether they agreed with the proposed management plan for each patient that was discussed. The specific aspects of care over which they disagreed were also described, and disagreements were classified a priori as major or minor. The primary outcome was the rate of disagreement over the handed over management plan. Six staff surgeons agreed to participate and a total of 417 unique patients were handed over during the study period. For the primary outcome, a total of 41 disagreements were recorded for a disagreement rate of 9.8 %. 15 of the 41 disagreements were classified as major, for a major disagreement rate of 3.6 %. Consultant to consultant disagreements were classified as major disagreements 63 % of the time, whereas consultant to resident disagreements were classified as major 31 % of the time (P = 0.217). On average, the age of patients for which a clinical disagreement occurred were older; 63 vs. 57 (P < 0.05). Despite the frequency of handovers in clinical practice, little research has been conducted to determine the rate of disagreement over patient management among surgeons participating working in academic centers. This study demonstrated that the rate of clinical disagreement is low among surgeons working in an tertiary care teaching hospital."

    "abstract": "The staged laparotomy in the operative management of emergency general surgery (EGS) patients is an extension of trauma surgeons operating on this population. Indications for its application, however, are not well defined, and are currently based on the lethal triad used in physiologically-decompensated trauma patients. This study sought to determine the acute indications for the staged, rapid source control laparotomy (RSCL) in EGS patients. All EGS patients undergoing emergent staged RSCL and non-RSCL over 3 years were studied. Demographics, physiologic parameters, perioperative variables, outcomes, and survival were compared. Logistic regression models determined the influence of physiologic parameters on mortality and postoperative complications. EGS-RSCL indications were defined. 215 EGS patients underwent emergent laparotomy; 53 (25 %) were staged RSCL. In the 53 patients who underwent a staged RSCL based on the lethal triad, adjusted multivariable regression analysis shows that when used alone, no component of the lethal triad independently improved survival. Staged RSCL may decrease mortality in patients with preoperative severe sepsis / septic shock, and an elevated lactate (≥3); acidosis (pH ≤ 7.25); elderly (≥70); male gender; and multiple comorbidities (≥3). Of the 162 non-RSCL emergent laparotomies, 27 (17 %) required unplanned re-explorations; of these, 17 (63 %) had sepsis preoperatively and 9 (33 %) died. The acute physiologic indicators that help guide operative decisions in trauma may not confer a similar survival advantage in EGS. To replace the lethal triad, criteria for application of the staged RSCL in EGS need to be defined. Based on these results, the indications should include severe sepsis / septic shock, lactate, acidosis, gender, age, and pre-existing comorbidities. When correctly applied, the staged RSCL may help to improve survival in decompensated EGS patients."

    "abstract": "Life expectancies in the UK are increasing and with this there is an increasing elderly population with more complex co-morbidity. Emergency surgery in the elderly is challenging in terms of decision making, managing co-morbidity and post-operative rehabilitation with high morbidity and mortality. To optimise service design and development, it is important to understand the changing pattern of emergency surgical care for this group. After obtaining necessary approvals, we approached each hospital trust in the North of England for details of every emergency admission under a general surgeon from 2000 to 2014. Data for each admission included demographics, co-morbidities, diagnoses, procedures undertaken and outcomes. There were 105 002 elderly (≥70 years) emergency general surgical admissions, and mean age and co-morbidity (defined by Charlson index scores) increased (both p < 0.001). Operative intervention was undertaken in a similar proportion of patients in all age groups (13%), with more patients undergoing operations over time (p < 0.001), of which 50% were within 48 h of admission. Overall in-hospital mortality decreased significantly as did length of hospital stay (both p < 0.001). Factors associated with increased 30 day in-hospital mortality were increasing age and Charlson score, admissions directly from clinic, operations undertaken at the weekend and patients admitted earlier in the study period. The workload of emergency general surgery in the elderly is becoming more complex. This challenge is already being addressed with improvements in outcomes. The data presented here reinforces the need for new models of care with increased multidisciplinary geriatric care input into elderly surgical patient care in the perioperative period."

However, minimal work has focused on the ideal care delivery system and team structure. We hypothesize that the implementation of a dedicated EGS team (separate from trauma and surgical critical care), with EGS-specific protocols and dedicated operating room (OR) time, will increase productivity and improve mortality. This is a retrospective review of financial and EGS registry data from fiscal year (FY) 12 to FY15. Data are from an academic, university-based EGS team composed of two acute care surgery attending surgeons, advanced practitioners (APs), residents, and a fellow. In FY12, processes were implemented to standardize paging of consults, patient sign-out with attending surgeons' and APs' participation, clinical/billing protocols, OR availability, and quality improvement. Outcomes included relative value units (RVUs), surgical case volume, charges/payments, and number of patient encounters. The secondary outcome was mortality. The χ test was used to compare mortality, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Total patient encounters increased from 6,723 in FY 12 to 9,238 in FY 15 (+37%). Relative value units increased from 18,422 in FY 12 to 25,314 in FY 15 (+37%). Charges increased by 76% and payments increased by 60% from FY 12 to FY 15. Charges per encounter increased from $461 in FY 12 to $591 in FY 15 (+28%) Additionally, both inpatient and surgical case loads increased. Mortality remained stable throughout the study period (FY 12, 4.5%; FY 13, 5.2%; FY 14, 5.3%; FY 15, 3.2%: p = 0.177). Implementation of dedicated OR time, defined EGS team structure, practice protocols, and active attending surgeons'/APs' participation was temporally related to increased case volume, patients seen, and revenue, while mortality remained unchanged.

We hypothesize there is a large Medicaid Gap between those receiving emergency general vs complex surgery at the same hospital. Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, 1998 to 2010, we identified high-volume pancreatectomy hospitals. We then compared the percentage of Medicaid patients receiving appendectomies vs pancreatectomies at these hospitals. Hospital characteristics associated with increased Medicaid Gap were evaluated using generalized estimating equation models. A total of 602 hospital-years of data from 289 high-volume pancreatectomy hospitals were included. Median percentages of Medicaid appendectomies and pancreatectomies were 12.1% (interquartile range: 5.8% to 19.8%) and 6.7% (interquartile range: 0% to 15.4%), respectively. Hospitals that performed greater than or equal to 40 pancreatic resections per year had higher odds of having significant Medicaid Gap (odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 5.0). Gaps exist between the percentages of Medicaid patients receiving emergency general surgery vs more complex surgical care at the same hospital and may be exaggerated in hospitals with very high volume of complex elective surgeries."

The optimal model for delivering high-quality emergency surgical care remains unknown. Acute Care Surgery (ACS) is a health care model combining emergency general surgery, trauma, and critical care. It has been adopted across the United States in the management of surgical emergencies. A systematic review was performed after PRISMA recommendations using the MEDLINE, Embase, and Psych-Info databases. Studies assessing different care models and institutional factors affecting the delivery of emergency general surgery were included. Twenty-seven studies comprising 744,238 patients were included in this review. In studies comparing ACS with traditional practice, mortality and morbidity were improved. Moreover, time to senior review, delays to operating theater, and financial expenditure were often reduced. The elements of ACS models varied but included senior clinicians present onsite during office hours and dedicated to emergency care while on-call. Referrals were made to specialist centers with primary surgical assessments taking place on surgical admissions units rather than in the emergency department. Twenty-four-hour access to dedicated emergency operating rooms was also described. ACS models as well as centralized units and hospitals with dedicated emergency operating rooms, access to radiology and intensive care facilities (ITU) are all factors associated with improved clinical and financial outcomes in the delivery of emergency general surgery. There is, however, no consensus on the elements that constitute an ideal ACS model and how it can be implemented into current surgical practice."

    "abstract": "The greatest advantages of laparoscopy when compared to open surgery include the faster recovery times, shorter hospital stays, decreased postoperative pain, earlier return to work and resumption of normal daily activity as well as cosmetic benefits. Laparoscopy today is considered the gold standard of care in the treatment of cholecystitis and appendicitis worldwide. Laparoscopy has even been adopted in colorectal surgery with good results. The technological improvements in this surgical field along with the development of modern techniques and the acquisition of specific laparoscopic skills have allowed for its utilization in operations with fully intracorporeal anastomoses. Further progress in laparoscopy has included single-incision laparoscopic surgery and natural orifice trans-luminal endoscopic surgery. Nevertheless, laparoscopy for emergency surgery is still considered challenging and is usually not recommended due to the lack of adequate experience in this area. The technical difficulties of operating in the presence of diffuse peritonitis or large purulent collections and diffuse adhesions are also given as reasons. However, the potential advantages of laparoscopy, both in terms of diagnosis and therapy, are clear. Major advantages may be observed in cases with diffuse peritonitis secondary to perforated peptic ulcers, for example, where laparoscopy allows the confirmation of the diagnosis, the identification of the position of the ulcer and a laparoscopic repair with effective peritoneal washout. Laparoscopy has also revolutionized the approach to complicated diverticulitis even when intestinal perforation is present. Many other emergency conditions can be effectively managed laparoscopically, including trauma in select hemodynamically-stable patients. We have therefore reviewed the most recent scientific literature on advances in laparoscopy for acute care surgery and trauma in order to demonstrate the current indications and outcomes associated with a laparoscopic approach to the treatment of the most common emergency surgical conditions."

We hypothesize that older patients will have increased mortality, patients will have protracted stays, they will require specialized postdischarge care, and the indications for OA will be varied. A prospective observational study of emergency general surgery OA patients from June 2013 to June 2014 was performed. Demographics, clinical/operative variables, comorbidities, indications for procedure and OA, wound/fascial complications, and disposition were collected. Patients were stratified into age groups (≤ 60, 61-79, and ≥ 80 years). Six-month and 1-year mortality was determined by query of the Social Security Death Index. A total of 338 laparotomies were performed, of which 96 (28%) were managed with an OA. Median age was 61 years (interquartile range [IQR], 0-68 years), and 51% were male. The median Charlson Comorbidity Index was 2 (IQR, 1.5-5.1), and the median hospital stay was 25 days (IQR, 15-50 days). The most common indications for operation were perforated viscus/free air (20%), mesenteric ischemia (17%), peritonitis (16%), and gastrointestinal hemorrhage (12%). The most common indication for OA was damage control (37%). In the 63 patients with fascial closure, there were 9 (14%) wound infections and 6 (10%) fascial dehiscences. A total of 30% of the patients died in the hospital, and an additional six patients died 6 months after discharge. Patients in the oldest age stratum were more likely to die at 6 months than those in the lower strata. Older patients were more likely to die by 6 months, the median hospital stay was 3 weeks, and there were multiple indications for OA management.

During each of the three years of their residency, residents are required to complete a trauma surgery rotation. These emergency medicine residents are the only residents participating on this rotation as there is no surgical residency. The Department of Acute Care Surgery, Trauma and Surgical Critical Care analyzed the impact of the residents on trauma patient care outcomes with the hypothesis that there were no differences. Data including length of stay in the hospital, length of stay in the intensive care unit, time spent in the emergency department (ED), morbidities and mortalities were compiled from the trauma registry for patients from the year before the residents began (March 1, 2006 to February 28, 2007) and compared with patients from the first year the residents began their trauma rotations (March 1, 2007 to February 29, 2008). T-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare continuous variables and a Chi-square test was used to analyze the categorical variable (mortality). Linear and logistic regression analyses were also performed in order to adjust for potential confounding factors. Trauma patient admission rates were 1,316 before and 1,391 after the residents began. No statistically significant differences were found among all of the outcome variables during the two time periods except for time spent in the ED (P = 0.00), which increased during the year the residents began (236.83 ± 4.53 minutes in 2006 compared to 297.40 ± 5.55 minutes in 2007). Linear and logistic regression analyses confirmed these results with the exception of a statistically significant decrease in mortality with the residents on the trauma service (2.8% in 2006 and 2.1% in 2007, P = 0.00) after adjustment for multiple confounding factors. The addition of emergency medicine residents to the trauma care service did increase ED length of stay, but did not increase overall hospital or intensive care unit length of stay. There was a statistically significant decrease in adjusted morbidity and mortality, thus supporting our hypothesis that the residency program did not negatively impact the trauma service and its goals of high quality patient care."

This study aims to provide information about potential future employment opportunities for surgical trainees. All consultant surgeon posts, advertised in the British Medical Journal between January 2009 and December 2014 were included. Data collected included specialty, region and institute of advertised post. For the purposes of statistical analysis, data was divided into two separate year bands: 2009-2011 and 2012-2014. Statistical analysis was by Chi-squared test; p <0.01 was considered statistically significant. An online tool was also used to determine experience and attitudes towards EGS amongst Consultant members of the ASGBI and all UK trainees in national training number (NTN) posts. Over the six-year study period, there were 1240 consultant job adverts in a general surgical specialty. Nine hundred and 75 were substantive posts; the region with the most jobs was London and the South East (n = 278). There were 55 jobs advertised in EGS, either with (20) or without (35) another subspecialty. The number of EGS adverts increased significantly in 2012-14 compared to 2009-11 (p = 0.008). 229 (28 %) Consultants and 309 (22 %) trainees responded to the survey. 16 % of consultants work in NHS institutions with Emergency General Surgeons. Only 21 % of trainees believe EGS will be delivered by EGS consultants in the future whilst 8.2 % of trainees stated EGS as their career plan. Less than half of all UK consultant surgeons see EGS as a subspecialty. This data demonstrates increasing societal need for EGS consultants over the last six years and the emergence of Emergency Surgery as a new subspecialty. In order to meet the EGS needs of the NHS, general surgical training and the examination system need to be revised."

The management of acute cholecystitis (AC) at a dedicated emergency surgical unit (ESU) was assessed as a performance target for EGS. The outcomes for AC admissions were compared one year before and after inception of the ESU. The impact on cost and compliance with national guidance recommending early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC) within seven days of diagnosis was assessed. The overall ELC rate increased from 26% for the 126 patients admitted in the pre-ESU period to 45% for the 152 patients admitted in the post-ESU period (p=0.001). With those unsuitable for ELC excluded, the ELC rate increased from 34% to 82% (p<0.001). The proportion of patients precluded from ELC for avoidable reasons, particularly owing to 'surgeon preference/skill', was reduced from 69% to 18% (p<0.001). The mean total length of stay (LOS) and postoperative LOS fell by 1.7 days (from 8.3 to 6.6 days, p=0.040) and 2 days (from 5.6 to 3.6 days, p=0.020) respectively. The higher ELC rate and the reduction in LOS produced additional tariff income (£111,930) and estimated savings in bed day (£90,440) and readmission (£27,252) costs. A dedicated ESU incorporating national recommendations for EGS improves alignment of best practice with best evidence and can also result in financial rewards for a busy district general hospital."

    "abstract": "The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) has developed a new grading system for uniform description of anatomic severity of emergency general surgery (EGS) diseases, ranging from Grade I (mild) to Grade V (severe). The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship of AAST grades for acute colonic diverticulitis with patient outcomes. A secondary purpose was to propose an EGS quality improvement program using risk-adjusted center outcomes, similar to National Surgical Quality Improvement Program and Trauma Quality Improvement Program methodologies. This was a retrospective study of 1,105 patients (one death) from 13 centers. At each center, two reviewers (blinded to each other's assignments) assigned AAST grades. Interrater reliability was measured using κ coefficient. Relationship between AAST grade and clinical events (complications, intensive care unit use, surgical intervention, and 30-day readmission) as well as length of stay was measured using regression analyses to control for age, comorbidities, and physiologic status at the time of admission. Final model was also used to calculate observed-to-expected (O-E) ratios for adverse outcomes (death, complications, readmissions) for each center. Median age was 54 years, 52% were males, 43% were minorities, and 22% required a surgical intervention. Almost two thirds had Grade I or II disease. There was a high level of agreement for grades between reviewers (κ = 0.81). Adverse events increased from 13% for Grade I, to 18% for Grade II, 28% for Grade III, 44% for Grade IV, and 50% for Grade V. Regression analysis showed that higher disease grades were independently associated with all clinical events and length of stay, after adjusting for age, comorbidities, and physiology. O-E ratios showed statistically insignificant variations in risk of death, complications, or readmissions. AAST grades for acute colonic diverticulitis are independently associated with clinical outcomes and resource use. EGS quality improvement program methodology that incorporates AAST grade, age, comorbidities, and physiologic status may be used for measuring quality of EGS care. High-quality EGS registries are essential for developing meaningful quality metrics. Prognostic study, level V."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery in the elderly is a particular challenge to the surgeon in charge of their care. The aim was to review contemporary aspects of managing elderly patients needing emergency general surgery and possible alterations to their pathways of care. This was a narrative review based on a PubMed/MEDLINE literature search up until 15 September 2015 for publications relevant to emergency general surgery in the geriatric patient. The number of patients presenting as an emergency with a general surgical condition increases with age. Up to one-quarter of all emergency admissions to hospital may be for general surgical conditions. Elderly patients are a particular challenge owing to added co-morbidity, use of drugs and risk of poor outcome. Frailty is an important potential risk factor, but difficult to monitor or manage in the emergency setting. Risk scores are not available universally. Outcomes are usually severalfold worse than after elective surgery, in terms of both higher morbidity and increased mortality. A care bundle including early diagnosis, resuscitation and organ system monitoring may benefit the elderly in particular. Communication with the patient and relatives throughout the care pathway is essential, as indications for surgery, level of care and likely outcomes may evolve. Ethical issues should also be addressed at every step on the pathway of care. Emergency general surgery in the geriatric patient needs a tailored approach to improve outcomes and avoid futile care. Although some high-quality studies exist in related fields, the overall evidence base informing perioperative acute care for the elderly remains limited."

    "abstract": "Introduction. Training opportunities have decreased dramatically since the introduction of the European Working Time Directive (EWTD). In order to maximise training we introduced a rotation schedule in which registrars do not work night shifts and elective training opportunities are protected. We aimed to determine the safety and effectiveness of this EWTD compliant rotation schedule in achieving exposure of trainees to acute general surgical admissions and operations. Methods. A prospective study of consecutive emergency surgical admissions over a 6-month period. Exposure to acute admissions and operative procedures and patient outcomes during day and night shifts was compared. Results. There were 1156 emergency admissions covering a broad range of acute conditions. Significantly more patients were admitted during the day shift and almost all emergency procedures were performed during the day shift (2.1 versus 0.3, p < 0.001). A registrar was the primary operating surgeon in 49% of cases and was directly involved in over 65%. There were no significant differences between patients admitted during the day and night shifts in mortality rate, length of stay, admission to ICU, requirement for surgery, or readmission rates. Conclusion. A EWTD compliant rotation schedule that protects elective training opportunities is safe for patients and provides adequate exposure to training opportunities in emergency surgery."

    "abstract": "There is an increasing evidence in the literature showing that Acute Care surgical patients, likewise patients from every other surgical subspeciality, should be best first approached and managed only by attending surgeons with approriate expertise in the field of Emergency and Trauma Surgery, as well as the occurrence of postoperative complications can be prevented or safely and appropriately treated when arising, only by those attending surgeons having a focused knowledge of the patient and specific subspeciality experience. The advantages of a consultant-led, patient-centered surgical management come along with the opportunity of maintaining the principles of continuity of care and specificity of expertise in managing surgical patients and their complications and readmissions. These principles should be particularly valid in the well-recognized subspeciality of Acute Care and Trauma Surgery; managing the challenging emergency surgical patients either in the preoperative and postoperative periods with the aim to improve the outcomes of Emergency Surgery, should only be by surgeons trained and experienced in both Acute Care Surgery and Trauma."

To our knowledge, comprehensive data on readmissions to the initial hospital or a different hospital after emergency general surgery (EGS) procedures do not exist. To define readmission rates and identify risk factors for readmission after common EGS procedures. Patients undergoing EGS, as defined by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma, were identified in the California State Inpatient Database (2007-2011) on January 15, 2015. Patients were 18 years and older. We identified the 5 most commonly performed EGS procedures in each of 11 EGS diagnosis groups. Patient demographics (sex, age, race/ethnicity, and insurance type) as well as Charlson Comorbidity Index score, length of stay, complications, and discharge disposition were collected. Factors associated with readmission were determined using multivariate logistic regression models analysis. Thirty-day hospital readmission. Among 177,511 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 57.1% were white, 48.8% were privately insured, and most were 45 years and older (51.3%). Laparoscopic appendectomy (35.2%) and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (19.3%) were the most common procedures. The overall 30-day readmission rate was 5.91%. Readmission rates ranged from 4.1% (upper gastrointestinal) to 16.8% (cardiothoracic). Of readmitted patients, 16.8% were readmitted at a different hospital. Predictors of readmission included Charlson Comorbidity Index score of 2 or greater (adjusted odds ratio: 2.26 [95% CI, 2.14-2.39]), leaving against medical advice (adjusted odds ratio: 2.24 [95% CI, 1.89-2.66]), and public insurance (adjusted odds ratio: 1.55 [95% CI, 1.47-1.64]). The most common reasons for readmission were surgical site infections (16.9%), gastrointestinal complications (11.3%), and pulmonary complications (3.6%). Readmission after EGS procedures is common and varies widely depending on patient factors and diagnosis categories. One in 5 readmitted patients will go to a different hospital, causing fragmentation of care and potentially obscuring the utility of readmission as a quality metric. Assisting socially vulnerable patients and reducing postoperative complications, including infections, are targets to reduce readmissions."

    "abstract": "The influx of new surgical residents and interns at the beginning of the academic year is assumed to be associated with poor outcomes. Referred to as the July phenomenon, this occurrence has been anecdotally associated with increases in the frequency of medical errors due to intern inexperience. Studies in various surgical specialties provide conflicting results. To determine whether an association between the July phenomenon and outcomes exists among a nationally representative sample of patients who underwent emergency general surgery (EGS). Retrospective analysis of data from the 2007-2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Data on adult patients (≥16 years of age) presenting to teaching hospitals with a principal diagnosis of an EGS condition, as defined by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma, were retrospectively analyzed. The patients who were included in our study were dichotomized into early (July-August) vs late (September-June) management. The original analyses were conducted in March 2015. Risk-adjusted multivariable regression based on calculated propensity scores was assessed for associations with differences in in-hospital mortality, complications, length of stay, and total hospital cost. A total of 1,433,528 patients who underwent EGS were included, weighted to represent 7,095,045 patients from 581 teaching hospitals nationwide; 17.6% were managed early. Relative to patients managed later, early patients had marginally lower risk-adjusted odds of mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.96 [95% CI, 0.92-0.99]), complications (OR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.96-0.99]), and developing a secondary EGS condition (OR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.97-0.98]). Length of stay and total hospital cost were comparable between the 2 groups (P > .05). Contrary to expectations, the EGS patients who were managed early fared equally well, if not better, than the EGS patients who were managed later. Potentially attributable to increased manpower and/or hypervigilance on the part of supervising senior residents or attending physicians, the results suggest that concerns among EGS patients related to the July phenomenon are unfounded."

Demographic and operative variables for all emergency general surgery patients managed with OA at an academic medical center were prospectively examined from June to December 2013. Primary outcome was complication requiring reoperation. Of 58 patients, 37 managed with OA achieved PFC. Of these, 14 needed re-exploration for dehiscence, compartment syndrome, infection, or other. Complications after PFC were not associated with age, type of operative intervention, time to closure, re-explorations, comorbidities, or mortality. Complications correlated with higher body mass index (P = .02), skin closure (P = .04), plasma infusion (P = .01), and less intraoperative bleeding (P = .05). Deep surgical site infection correlated with fascial dehiscence (P = .02). Reoperation after PFC was more likely in obese and nonhemorrhagic patients. Recognition of these factors and strategies to reduce surgical site infection may improve outcomes."

Abbreviated Mental Test Score-4 (AMTS), Barthel Index, Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES-13), and EuroQol-5 Dimensional Scale (EQ-5D) completed by participants or their surrogates within 24 hours of admission to the hospital and 6 months after discharge. Paired t-tests and McNemar tests were used to assess the difference between baseline and 6 months. One hundred fifty-five consecutive individuals (including 16 surrogates) were enrolled. Sixteen (10%) died within 6 months of discharge, and 116 (75%, including 18 surrogates) completed a follow-up assessment 6 months after discharge. Cognitive status improved substantially over 6 months, with 72 (52%) of participants having AMTS scores showing cognitive impairment at baseline and four (4%) having AMTS scores showing cognitive impairment at 6 months (P < .001). There was no statistically significant change from baseline on the Barthel Index, VES-13, or EQ-5D. There was significant cognitive improvement in older adults after surgical hospitalization. HRQL improved back to age-matched population norms. These results suggest that elderly adults admitted for emergency surgery have good cognitive, functional, and HRQL outcomes."

The purposes of this study were to estimate the costs associated with specific EGS diseases and to identify factors associated with high-cost hospitalizations. The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma definition was used to identify hospitalizations of adult EGS patients in the 2010 National Inpatient Sample data. Cost of each hospitalization was obtained using cost-to-charge ratio in National Inpatient Sample. Regression analysis was used to estimate the cost for each EGS disease adjusted for patient and hospital characteristics. Hospitalizations with cost exceeding 75th percentile for each EGS disease were compared with lower-cost hospitalizations to identify factors associated with high cost. Thirty-one EGS diseases resulted in 2,602,074 hospitalizations nationwide in 2010 at an average adjusted cost of $10,110 (95% confidence interval, $10,086-$10,134) per hospitalization. Of these, only nine diseases constituted 80% of the total volume and 74% of the total cost. Empyema chest, colorectal cancer, and small intestine cancer were the most expensive EGS diseases with adjusted mean cost per hospitalization exceeding $20,000, while breast infection, abdominal pain, and soft tissue infection were the least expensive, with mean adjusted costs of less than $7,000 per hospitalization. The most important factors associated with high-cost hospitalizations were the number and type of procedures performed (76.2% of variance), but a region in Western United States (11.3%), Medicare and Medicaid payors (2.6%), and hospital ownership by public or not-for-profit entities (5.6%) were also associated with high-cost hospitalizations. A small number of diseases constitute a vast majority of EGS hospitalizations and their cost. Attempts at reducing the cost of EGS hospitalization will require controlling the cost of procedures.

This study was designed to establish whether lymphocyte count was associated with mortality in emergency general surgery (EGS) patients, and whether persistent lymphopenia was an independent predictor of mortality. A retrospective review of a prospectively compiled database of adult patients requiring ICU admission between 2002 and 2013 was performed. EGS patients with acute intra-abdominal pathology and organ dysfunction were included. Lymphocyte counts obtained from the day of ICU admission through to day 7 were examined. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine the relationship between persistent lymphopenia and outcome. The primary outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. The study included 173 patients, of whom 135 (78 %) had a low lymphocyte count at admission to ICU and 91 % (158/173) developed lymphopenia on at least one occasion. Lymphocyte counts were lower among non-survivors compared with survivors on each day from day 2 (0.62 vs 0.81, p = 0.03) through to day 7 (0.87 vs 1.15, p < 0.01). Patients with a persistently low lymphocyte count during the study period had significantly higher mortality when compared to patients with other lymphocyte patterns (64 vs 29 %, p < 0.01). On multivariate regression analysis, persistent lymphopenia was independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality [odds ratio 3.5 (95 % CI 1.7-7.3), p < 0.01]. Lymphopenia is commonly observed in critically ill EGS patients. Patients with persistent lymphopenia are 3.5 times more likely to die and lymphopenia is an independent predictor of increased mortality in this patient group."

A retrospective observational study of all consecutive emergency general surgical admissions in 2009-2012 was performed. A 2-year time frame before and after the establishment of the emergency general surgery (EGS) service was used to determine the number of admissions and operations, emergency department and hospital length of stay, as well as complication rates. The study included 7233 acute admissions. The EGS service managed 4468 patients (61·6 per cent increase) and performed 1804 operations (41·0 per cent increase). The most common diagnoses during the EGS period included acute appendicitis (532, 11·9 per cent), biliary disease (361, 8·1 per cent) and abdominal pain (561, 12·6 per cent). Appendicectomy (536, 29·7 per cent), cholecystectomy (239, 13·2 per cent) and laparotomy (226, 12·5 per cent) were the most commonly performed procedures.

Omental patch repair was carried out. After surgery, he suddenly vomited blood and manifested hypovolemic shock. An emergency upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was carried out immediately. However, the bleeding source was not visible. Dynamic-enhanced abdominal computed tomography showed a pseudoaneurysm of the gastroduodenal artery-communicating duodenal lumen with extravasation. Next, the patient underwent angiography for embolization. However, selective arterial embolization was not successful. Finally, duodenotomy was carried out. The fistula between the pseudoaneurysm and duodenal lumen was directly ligated. An aneurysm could be clearly identified by previous findings. Gastroduodenal artery aneurysms are very uncommon but possibly lethal if they rupture. This life-threatening condition requires rapid diagnosis and treatment. Minimally invasive treatment is the preferred therapy for gastroduodenal artery aneurysm; however, acute care surgery should be considered without hesitation when conditions are critical."

However, computed tomography (CT) is used widely for the evaluation of abdominal pain and is often obtained as a first abdominal imaging test, particularly in cases in which typical clinical signs of AC are absent or other possible diagnoses are being considered. We hypothesized that CT is more sensitive than US for diagnosing AC. A prospective registry of all urgent cholecystectomies performed by our acute care surgery service between June 2008 and January 2014 was searched for cases of AC. The final diagnosis was based on operative findings and pathology. Patients were classified into two groups according to pre-operative radiographic work-up: US only or CT and US. The US group was compared with the CT and US group with respect to clinical and demographic characteristics. For patients undergoing both tests the sensitivity of the two tests was compared. One hundred one patients with AC underwent both US and CT. Computed tomography was more sensitive than US for the diagnosis of AC (92% versus 79%, p=0.015). Ultrasound was more sensitive than CT for identification of cholelithiasis (87% versus 60%, p<0.01). Patients undergoing both tests prior to surgery were more likely to be older, male, have medical comorbidities, and lack typical clinical signs of AC. Computed tomography is more sensitive than US for the diagnosis of AC and is most often used in patients without typical clinical signs of AC."

Historically, this has been difficult to achieve due to lack of emergency surgical resources. We investigated whether implementation of an acute care surgery (ACS) model would allow better adherence to current practice guidelines for GSP. A retrospective review was conducted of all patients admitted with the diagnosis of GSP to 2 tertiary care university teaching hospitals from January 2002 to October 2013. Diagnosis was confirmed on review of clinical, biochemical, and radiographic criteria. Patients were divided into pre-ACS (2002 to 2009) and post-ACS (2010 to 2013) eras. Only 1 of the 2 hospitals implemented an ACS service in the latter era. Data were collected on demographics, admissions, cholecystectomy timing, and emergency department visits. Before implementation of an ACS service, the rate of index cholecystectomy was 3% at both hospital sites. The rate of index cholecystectomy increased significantly with the addition of ACS, from 2.4% to 67% (p < 0.001). The presence of an ACS team was highly predictive of index cholecystectomy (odds ratio = 10.4; 95% CI 2.0 to 55.1). Patients who did not undergo cholecystectomy during the index admission had an overall readmission rate of 24.9% at both sites. In the ACS hospital, repeat emergency department visits decreased from 24.8% to 8.3% (p < 0.001) and readmission rate decreased from 16.8% to 7.3% (p = 0.04) in the pre-and post-ACS eras, respectively. Implementation of an ACS service resulted in a higher rate of index cholecystectomy and decreased emergency department visits and readmissions for biliary disease, and allowed for increased adherence to clinical practice guidelines for GSP."

The objective of this study was to describe the disease spectrum of EGS conditions and associated factors among patients presenting in a low-middle income context. March 2009-April 2014 discharge data from a university teaching hospital in South Asia were obtained for patients (≥16 years) with primary International Classification of Diseases, 9(th) revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes consistent with an EGS condition as defined by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma. Outcomes included in-hospital mortality and occurrence of ≥1 major complication(s). Multivariable analyses were performed, adjusting for differences in demographic and case-mix factors. A total of 13,893 discharge records corresponded to EGS conditions. Average age was 47.2 years (±16.8, standard deviation), with a male preponderance (59.9%). The majority presented with admitting diagnoses of biliary disease (20.2%), followed by soft-tissue disorders (15.7%), hernias (14.9%), and colorectal disease (14.3%).

    "abstract": "Adoption of the acute care surgery model has led to increasing volumes of emergency general surgery (EGS) patients at trauma centers. However, the financial burden of EGS services on trauma centers is unknown. This study estimates the current and future costs associated with EGS hospitalization nationwide. We applied the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma's DRG International Classification of Diseases-9th Rev. criteria for defining EGS to the 2010 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) data and identified adult EGS patients. Cost of hospitalization was obtained by converting reported charges to cost using the 2010 all-payer inpatient cost-to-charge ratio for all hospitals in the NIS database. Cost was modeled via a log-gamma model in a generalized linear mixed model to account for potential correlation in cost within states and hospitals in the NIS database. Patients' characteristics and hospital factors were included in the model as fixed effects, while state and hospital were included as random effects. The national incidence of EGS was calculated from NIS data, and the US Census Bureau population projections were used to estimate incidence for 2010 to 2060. Nationwide costs were obtained by multiplying projected incidences by estimated costs and reported in year 2010 US dollar value. Nationwide, there were 2,640,725 adult EGS hospitalizations in 2010. The national average adjusted cost per EGS hospitalization was $10,744 (95% confidence interval [CI], $10,615-$10,874); applying these cost data to the national EGS hospitalizations gave a total estimated cost of $28.37 billion (95% CI, $28.03-$28.72 billion). Older age groups accounted for greater proportions of the cost ($8.03 billion for age ≥ 75 years, compared with $1.08 billion for age 18-24 years). As the US population continues to both grow and age, EGS costs are projected to increase by 45% to $41.20 billion (95% CI, $40.70-$41.7 billion) by 2060. EGS constitutes a significant portion of US health care costs and is expected to rise with the demographic changes in the population. Trauma centers should conduct careful financial analyses of their EGS services, based on their unique case mix and payer mix. Economic analysis, level III."

    "title": "The impact of acute care surgery on appendicitis outcomes: Results from a national sample of university-affiliated hospitals.",
    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common indication for emergency general surgery (EGS) in the United States. We examined the role of acute care surgery (ACS) on interventions and outcomes for acute appendicitis at a national sample of university-affiliated hospitals. We surveyed senior surgeons responsible for EGS coverage at University HealthSystems Consortium hospitals, representing more than 90% of university-affiliated hospitals in the United States. The survey elicited data on resources allocated for EGS during 2013. Responses were linked to University HealthSystems Consortium outcomes data by unique hospital identifiers. Patients treated at hospitals reporting hybrid models for EGS coverage were excluded. Differences in interventions and outcomes between patients with acute appendicitis treated at ACS hospitals versus hospitals with a general surgeon on-call model (GSOC) were analyzed using univariate comparisons and multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for patient demographics, clinical acuity, and hospital characteristics. We found 122 hospitals meeting criteria for analysis where 2,565 patients were treated for acute appendicitis. Forty-eight percent of hospitals had an ACS model (n = 1,414), and 52% had a GSOC model (n = 1,151). Hospitals with ACS models were more likely to treat minority patients than those with GSOC models. Patients treated at ACS hospitals were more likely to undergo laparoscopic appendectomy. In multivariable modeling of patients who had surgery (n = 2,258), patients treated at ACS hospitals had 1.86 (95% confidence interval, 1.23-2.80) greater odds of undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy. In an era when laparoscopic appendectomy is increasingly accepted for treating uncomplicated acute appendicitis, particularly in low-risk patients, it is concerning that patients treated at GSOC model hospitals are more likely to undergo traditional open surgery at the time of presentation. Furthermore, hospitals with ACS are functioning as safety-net hospitals for vulnerable patients with acute appendicitis. Therapeutic study, level IV."

    "abstract": "Acute care surgery services continue expanding to provide emergency general surgery (EGS) care. The aim of this study is to define the characteristics of the EGS population in Maryland. Retrospective review of the Health Services Cost Review Commission database from 2009 to 2013 was performed. American Association for the Surgery of Trauma-defined EGS ICD-9 codes were used to define the EGS population. Data collected included patient demographics, admission origin [emergency department (ED) versus non-ED], length of stay (LOS), mortality, and disposition. There were 3,157,646 encounters. In all, 817,942 (26%) were EGS encounters, with 76 per cent admitted via an ED. The median age of ED patients that died was 74 years versus 61 years for those that lived (P < 0.001). Twenty one per cent of ED admitted patients had a LOS > 7 days. Of 78,065 non-ED admitted patients, the median age of those that died was 68 years versus 59 years for those that lived (P < 0.001). Twenty eight per cent of non-ED admits had LOS > 7 days. In both ED and non-ED patients, there was a bimodal distribution of death, with most patients dying at LOS ≤ 2 or LOS > 7 days. In this study, EGS diagnoses are present in 26 per cent of inpatient encounters in Maryland. The EGS population is elderly with prolonged LOS and a bimodal distribution of death."

    "title": "Perioperative factors predicting poor outcome in elderly patients following emergency general surgery: a multivariate regression analysis.",
    "abstract": "Older adults (≥ 65 yr) are the fastest growing population and are presenting in increasing numbers for acute surgical care. Emergency surgery is frequently life threatening for older patients. Our objective was to identify predictors of mortality and poor outcome among elderly patients undergoing emergency general surgery. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients aged 65-80 years undergoing emergency general surgery between 2009 and 2010 at a tertiary care centre. Demographics, comorbidities, in-hospital complications, mortality and disposition characteristics of patients were collected. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify covariate-adjusted predictors of in-hospital mortality and discharge of patients home. Our analysis included 257 patients with a mean age of 72 years; 52% were men. In-hospital mortality was 12%. Mortality was associated with patients who had higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class (odds ratio [OR] 3.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.43-10.33, p = 0.008) and in-hospital complications (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.32-2.83, p = 0.001). Nearly two-thirds of patients discharged home were younger (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85-0.99, p = 0.036), had lower ASA class (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27-0.74, p = 0.002) and fewer in-hospital complications (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53-0.90, p = 0.007). American Society of Anesthesiologists class and in-hospital complications are perioperative predictors of mortality and disposition in the older surgical population. Understanding the predictors of poor outcome and the importance of preventing in-hospital complications in older patients will have important clinical utility in terms of preoperative counselling, improving health care and discharging patients home. La population qui connaît la croissance la plus rapide est celle des adultes âgés (≥ 65 ans). Ces personnes nécessitent un nombre croissant d’interventions chirurgicales urgentes. Or, la chirurgie d’urgence comporte souvent un risque de décès pour les patients âgés. Notre objectif était d’identifier les prédicteurs de la mortalité et d’une issue négative chez les patients âgés soumis à une chirurgie générale d’urgence. Nous avons procédé à une étude de cohorte rétrospective chez des patients de 65 à 80 ans soumis à une chirurgie générale d’urgence entre 2009 et 2010 dans un centre de soins tertiaires. Nous avons recueilli les données démographiques, les comorbidités, les complications perhospitalières, la mortalité et les détails sur l’état général de santé des patients. Nous avons utilisé l’analyse de régression logistique afin de dégager les prédicteurs ajustés en fonction des covariables pour la mortalité perhospitalière et les congés hospitaliers des patients vers leur domicile. Notre analyse a regroupé 257 patients âgés en moyenne de 72 ans; 52 % étaient des hommes. La mortalité perhospitalière a été de 12 %. La mortalité a été associée à des patients qui se classaient dans une catégorie ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) plus élevée (rapport des cotes [RC] 3,85, intervalle de confiance [IC] de 95 % 1,43–10,33, p = 0,008) et présentaient plus de complications perhospitalières (RC 1,93, IC de 95 % 1,32–2,83, p = 0,001). Près des deux tiers des patients qui ont reçu leur congé pour retourner à la maison étaient plus jeunes (RC 0,92, IC de 95 % 0,85–0,99, p = 0,036), se classaient dans une catégorie ASA moins élevée (RC 0,45, IC de 95 % 0,27– 0,74, p = 0,002) et avaient connu moins de complications perhospitalières (RC 0,69, IC de 95 % 0,53–0,90, p = 0,007). La catégorie ASA et les complications perhospitalières sont des prédicteurs périopératoires de mortalité et d’état général de santé dans la population âgée soumise à la chirurgie. Comprendre les prédicteurs d’une issue négative et l’importance de prévenir les complications perhospitalières chez les patients âgés aura une importante utilité clinique pour les consultations préopératoires, l’amélioration des soins de santé et le retour des patients à la maison."

    "abstract": "Acute gangrenous cholecystitis (AGC) is a medical emergency that carries high morbidity. The objective of this study is to define risk factors for this disease. A retrospective review of patients who underwent cholecystectomy while admitted to the Acute Care Surgery Service from January 2009 to April 2014 was performed. Specimen reports were evaluated to identify patients with AGC and cholecystitis without necrosis (CN). Preoperative factors as well as outcomes were compared between the groups. A total of 483 patents underwent cholecystectomy. Four hundred fifty-nine patients were found to have CN and 24 patients were found to have AGC. Pre-existent factors such as diabetes, coronary artery disease, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome predicted AGC on a logistic regression. Patients with AGS were also more commonly older, male, and had a higher preoperative bilirubin. Mortality was significantly higher in patients with AGC (12.5% vs .9%, P = .003). AGC carries an increased mortality rate compared with CN. Older patients with diabetes, coronary artery disease, and elevated bilirubin should be suspected of having AGC."

    "abstract": "Delivery of health care in the UK faces enormous challenges with the Department of Health driving significant financial cost savings to ensure viability of public health services. We have analysed and modelled the concept of 'essential' and 'non-essential' paediatric surgery linked to the delivery of children's surgery in the NHS in England. Operation codes for surgical operations in newborns, children and adolescents were identified and Healthcare Resource Group tariffs-£Stg matched. Operations were designated as 'essential' or 'non-essential' based on the criteria-(1) life saving-neonatal surgery, emergency general surgery of childhood, cancer surgery; (2) debility if uncorrected; (3) aesthetics and (4) culture/attitude. Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data were accessed and sampled for the total number of paediatric surgical operations-(age range 0-14 years) performed in NHS hospitals from 2009 to 2010. Annual costs (£) of both 'essential' and 'non-essential' operations were then calculated. The commonest 'essential' operations performed in children and adolescents in the year 2009-2010 was appendicectomy at a cost of over £51 million pounds. Costs of performing a selection of 'non-essential' paediatric surgery operations were >£14 million pounds/year. The NHs funds for example almost 11,000 paediatric circumcisions annually at a cost of >£8 million pounds-50% are performed for non-therapeutic reasons. Surgeons must engage and work actively with health care systems to ensure diminishing financial resources prioritise 'essential' operations for children. Commissioners must embrace evidence-based surgery. 'Essential' and 'non-essential' surgery has wide implications for the sustainability of the NHS and concepts herein developed can be applied to nations worldwide."

    "abstract": "The pressures on tertiary hospitals with increased volume and complexity related to regionalization and specialization has impacted upon availability of operating theatres with consequent displacement of emergencies to high risk out of hours settings. A retrospective review of an electronic emergency theatre list prospectively maintained database was performed over a two year period. Data gathered included type of operation performed, Time to Theatre (TTT), operation start time and length of stay (LOS). Of 7041 emergency operations 25% were performed out of hours. 2949 patient had general surgical emergency procedures with 910 (30%) performed out of hours. 53% of all emergency laparotomies and 54% of appendicectomies were out of hours. 57% of cases operated on out of hours had been awaiting surgery during the day. Mean TTT was shorter for those admitted at the weekend compared to those admitted during the week (15.6 vs 24.9 h) (p < 0.0001). The majority of major emergency surgery is performed out of hours in a way unfavorable to good clinical outcomes. It is of concern that more than half of the most life threating procedures involving laparotomy, take place out of hours. Regionalization needs to be accompanied by infrastructure planning to accommodate emergency surgery."

    "abstract": "The United Kingdom National Health Service treats both elective and emergency patients and seeks to provide high quality care, free at the point of delivery. Equal numbers of emergency and elective general surgical procedures are performed, yet surgical training prioritisation and organisation of NHS institutions is predicated upon elective care. The increasing ratio of emergency general surgery consultant posts compared to traditional sub-specialities has yet to be addressed. How should the capability gap be bridged to equip motivated, skilled surgeons of the future to deliver a high standard of emergency surgical care? The aim was to address both training requirements for the acquisition of necessary emergency general surgery skills, and the formation of job plans for trainee and consultant posts to meet the current and future requirements of the NHS. Twenty nine trainees and a consultant emergency general surgeon convened as a Working Group at The Association of Surgeons in Training Conference, 2015, to generate a united consensus statement to the training requirement and delivery of emergency general surgery provision by future general surgeons. Unscheduled general surgical care provision, emergency general surgery, trauma competence, training to meet NHS requirements, consultant job planning and future training challenges arose as key themes. Recommendations have been made from these themes in light of published evidence. Careful workforce planning, education, training and fellowship opportunities will provide well-trained enthusiastic individuals to meet public and societal need."

    "abstract": "The unpredictable and sometimes chaotic environment present in acute care surgery services (trauma, burn, surgical critical care, and nontrauma emergency surgery) can cause high levels of anxiety and stress that could impact a medical students' experience during their third year of medical school surgical clerkship. This negative perception perhaps is a determinant influence in diverting talented students into other medical subspecialties. We sought out to objectively identify potential areas of improvement through direct feedback and implement programmatic changes to address these areas. We hypothesized that as the changes were made, students' perception of the rotation would improve. Review of end of clerkship third year of medical school trauma burn surgery rotation evaluations and comments was performed for the 2010-2011 academic year. Trends in negative feedback were identified and categorized into five areas for improvement as follows: logistics, student expectations, communication, team integration, and feedback. A plan was designed and implemented for each category. Feedback on improvements to the rotation was monitored via surveys and during monthly end of rotation face-to-face student feedback sessions with the rotation faculty facilitator and surgery clerkship director. Data were compiled and reviewed. Perceptions of the rotation markedly improved within the first month of the changes and continued to improve over the study time frame (2011-2013) in all five categories. We also observed an increase in the number of students selecting a surgical residency in the National Resident Matching Program match from a low of 8% in 2009-2010 before any interventions to 25% after full implementation of the improvement measures in 2011-2012. A systematic approach using direct feedback from students to address service-specific issues improves perceptions of students on the educational value of a busy trauma-burn acute care surgery service and may have a positive influence on students considering surgical careers to pursue a surgical specialty."

However; the impact of development of certified acute care surgery (ACS) programs on patient outcomes remains unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes in patients undergoing EGS across TCs, NTCs, and TCs with ACS (ACS-TC). National estimates for EGS procedures were abstracted from the National Inpatient Sample database. Patients undergoing emergent procedures (appendectomy, cholecystectomy, hernia repair, as well as small and large bowel resections) were included. TCs were identified based on American College of Surgeons' verification. ACS-TC programs were recorded from the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma. Outcome measures were hospital length of stay, complications, and mortality. Regression analysis was performed after adjusting for age, sex, race, Charlson comorbidity index, and type of procedure. A total of 131,410 patients undergoing EGS were analyzed. Patients managed in ACS-TCs had shorter hospital stay (p = 0.045) and lower complication rate (p = 0.041) compared with patients managed in both TCs and NTCs. There was no difference in mortality in patients managed across the groups; however, there was a trend toward lower mortality in patients managed in ACS-TCs in comparison with TCs (p = 0.064) and NTCs (p = 0.089). The overall hospital costs were lower for patients managed in ACS-TCs compared with TCs (p = 0.036). TCs with ACS have improved outcomes in EGS procedures compared with both TCs and non-TCs. ACS training with the associated infrastructure standards may contribute to these improved outcomes. Therapeutic/care management study, level IV."

This is a report of a 44 year old man who experienced hemorrhagic shock during video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement (VARD) for necrotizing pancreatitis where REBOA was used to prevent ongoing hemorrhage and death. This is the first documented report REBOA being used during pancreatic debridement in the literature and one of the first times it has been used in emergency general surgery. The use of REBOA is an option for those in hemorrhagic shock whom conventional aortic cross-clamping or supra-celiac aortic exposure is either not possible or exceedingly dangerous. REBOA allows for adequate resuscitation and can be used as a bridge to definitive therapy in a range of surgical subspecialties with minimal morbidity and complications. The risks associated with insertion of wires, sheaths, and catheters into the arterial system, as well as the risk of visceral and spinal cord ischemia due to aortic occlusion mandate that the use of this technique be utilized in only appropriate clinical scenarios."

This study was designed to document current methods of GS preparation during surgery residency and to determine characteristics of programs that produce more graduates who pursue GS practice. An email survey was sent by the American Board of Surgery General Surgery Advisory Committee to program directors of all GS residencies. Program demographic information was procured from the American Board of Surgery database and linked to survey results. Multiple regression was used to predict postresidency choices of graduates. Totally, 252 US allopathic surgical residencies. Totally, 171 residency program directors (68% response rate). The proportion of programs using an emergency/acute care surgery rotation at the main teaching hospital to teach GS increased from 63% in 2003 to 83% in 2014. An autonomous GS outpatient experience was offered in 38% of programs. Practice management curricula were offered in 28% of programs. Institutions with fewer postresidency fellowships (p < 0.003) and fewer surgical specialty residencies (p < 0.036) had a greater percentage of graduates who pursued GS practice. The addition of each fellowship at an institution was associated with a 2% decrease in the number of graduates pursuing GS practice. Residency size was not associated with predilection for fellowship selection and there was no difference between university and independent residencies vis-a-vis the proportion selecting fellowship vs GS practice. Practice management principles and autonomous GS outpatient clinic experiences are offered in a minority of programs. Graduates of programs in institutions with fewer surgery fellowships and residencies are more likely to pursue GS practice. Increased number of postresidency fellowships and specialty residencies may be associated with fewer GS rotations and fewer GS mentors. Further study of these relationships seems warranted."

The formation of ACS services has been shown to improve outcomes and lead to more expeditious care. Despite the advances of ACS, the etiology and timing of patient mortality has yet to be described. We hypothesized that infectious complications occur more frequently in ACS patients that die during their hospitalization. A retrospective review of a local ACS service (non-trauma) registry was conducted. Demographic variables, admission and discharge data, and ICD-9 codes were collected. ICD-9 codes were used to identify patients with sepsis, shock, GI perforation, peritonitis, and other hospital acquired infections (urinary tract, bloodstream, and ventilator-associated pneumonias). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to model the outcome of death. 1,329 patients were analyzed. 53 % were male with the mean age of 52 years and an average length of stay of 13 days. 106 (8 %) died while in the hospital. Of the patients who died, 34 (32 %) died within 7 days of admission. The majority of mortalities (56 %) occurred after hospital day 14. In ACS patients that died, there were significantly higher rates of sepsis, shock, peritonitis, urinary tract infections, and VAP. After adjustment; age, sepsis on admission, and shock on admission were associated with greater odds of death. ACS patients with sepsis and shock have higher mortality rate than those patients without. The majority of ACS patient deaths occurred after hospital day 14. Further investigation and continued focus on preventing and rapidly treating infectious complications as they arise is warranted."

Older age may be associated with poorer outcomes for some elective procedures, but there are few studies focusing on outcomes for the elderly ACS population. Our objective is to characterize differences in mortality and morbidity for acute care surgery patients >80 years old. A retrospective review of all ACS admissions at a large teaching hospital over 1 year was conducted. Patients were classified into non-elderly (<80 years old) and elderly (≥80 years old). In addition to demographic differences, outcomes including care efficiency, mortality, postoperative complications, and length of stay were studied. Data analysis was completed with the Student's t test for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables using STATA 12 (College Station, TX, USA). We identified 467 non-elderly and 60 elderly patients with a mean age-adjusted Charlson score of 3.2 and 7.2, respectively (p < 0.001) and a mortality risk of 1.9 and 11.7 %, respectively (p < 0.001). The elderly were at risk of longer duration (>4 days) hospital stay (p = 0.05), increased postoperative complications (p = 0.002), admission to the ICU (p = 0.002), and were more likely to receive a non-operative procedure (p = 0.003). No difference was found (p = NS) for patient flow factors such as time to consult general surgery, time to see consult by general surgery, and time to operative management and disposition. Compared to younger patients admitted to an acute care surgery service, patients over 80 years old have a higher risk of complications, are more likely to require ICU admission, and stay longer in the hospital."

The aim of this study was to analyse the 30-day mortality, age-related 30-day mortality and 1-year mortality following emergency laparotomy. We hope this will encourage prospective data collection, improvement of care and initiate strategies to establish best practice in this area. This was a retrospective study of patients who underwent emergency laparotomy from June 2010 to May 2012. The primary end point of the study was 30-day mortality, age-related 30-day mortality and 1-year all-cause mortality. 477 laparotomies were performed in 446 patients. 57% were aged <70 and 43% aged >70 years. 30-day mortality was 12, 4% in those aged <70 years and 22% in those >70 years (p < 0.001). 1-year mortality was 25, 15% in those aged under 70 years and 38% in those aged >70 years (p < 0.001). Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care."

The acute care surgery (ACS) model is new and remains confined mostly to academic centers. Some argue that in busy trauma centers, on-call trauma surgeons may be unable to also care for EGS patients. In New Jersey, all three Level 1 Trauma Centers (L1TC) have provided ACS services for many years. Analyzing NJ state inpatient data, we sought to determine whether outcomes in one common surgical illness, diverticulitis, have been different between L1TC and nontrauma centers (NTC) over a 10-year period. The NJ Medical Database was queried for patients aged 18 to 90 hospitalized from 2001 to 2010 for acute diverticulitis. Demographics, comorbidities, operative rates, and mortality were compiled and analyzed comparing L1TC to NTC. For additional comparison between L1TC and NTC, 1:1 propensity score matching with replacement was accomplished. χ(2), t test, and Cochran-Armitage trend test were used. From 2001 to 2010, 88794 patients were treated in NJ for diverticulitis. 2621 patients (2.95%) were treated at L1TCs. Operative rates were similar between hospital types. Patients treated at L1TCs were more often younger (63.1 ± 0.3 vs 64.7 ± 0.1; P < 0.001), nonwhite (43.1% vs 23.1%; P < 0.0001), and uninsured (11.0% vs 5.5%; P < 0.0001). After propensity matching, neither operative mortality (9.7% vs 7.9% P = 0.45), nor nonoperative mortality (1.2% vs 1.3% P = 0.60) were different between groups. Mortality and operative rates for patients with acute diverticulitis are equivalent between LT1C and NTC in NJ. Trauma centers in NJ more commonly provide care to minority and uninsured patients."

    "abstract": "Geriatric patients remain largely unstudied in low-middle income health care settings. The purpose of this study was to compare the epidemiology and outcomes of older versus younger adults with emergency general surgical conditions in South Asia. Discharge data from March 2009 to April 2014 were obtained for all adult patients (≥16 years) with an International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes consistent with an emergency general surgery condition as defined by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma. Multivariable regression analyses compared patients >65 years of age with patients ≤65 years for differences in all-cause mortality, major complications, and duration of hospital stay. Models were adjusted for potential confounding owing to patient demographic and clinical case-mix data with propensity scores. We included 13,893 patients; patients >65 years constituted 15% (n = 2,123) of the cohort. Relative to younger patients, older adults were more likely to present with a number of emergency general surgery conditions, including gastrointestinal bleeding (odds ratio OR [95% CI], 2.63[1.99-3.46]), resuscitation (2.17 [1.67-2.80]), and peptic ulcer disease (2.09 [1.40-3.10]). They had an 89% greater risk-adjusted odds (1.89 [1.55-2.29]) of complications and a 63% greater odds (1.63 [1.21-2.20]) of mortality. Restricted to patients undergoing operative interventions, older adults had 95% greater odds (1.95 [1.29-2.94]) of complications and 117% greater odds (2.17 [1.62-2.91]) of mortality. Understanding unique needs of geriatric patients is critical to enhancing the management and prioritization of appropriate care in developing settings."

    "abstract": "Surgical management of emergent, life-threatening diseases is an important public health priority. The objectives of this study were to (1) describe acute care general surgery procedures performed at the largest referral hospital in Rwanda and (2) understand the geographic distribution of disease presentations and referral patterns. We performed a retrospective review of prospectively collected acute care surgery cases performed at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Kigali (CHUK) in Rwanda between June 1 and December 1, 2011. Using Pearson's χ(2) test and the Fisher exact test, we compared cases originating from within Kigali and transfers from other provinces. Geospatial analyses also were used to further describe transfer patterns. During the study period, 2,758 surgical interventions were performed, of which 25.6% (707/2,758) were general surgery operations. Of these, 45.4% (321/707) met the definition of acute care surgery. Only about one-third-32.3% (92/285)-of patients resided within Kigali, whereas about two-thirds-67.7% (193/285)-were transferred from other provinces. Most patients transferred from other provinces were younger than 18 years of age (40.4%; 78/193), and 83.0% (39/47) of patients older than 50 years of age originated from outside of Kigali. Specific operative indications and surgical procedures varied substantially between patients from Kigali and patients transferred from other provinces. Emergency surgical conditions remain important contributors to the global burden of disease, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Geographic variations exist in terms of operative diagnoses and procedures, which implies a need for improved access to surgical care at the district level with defined transfer mechanisms to greater-level care facilities when needed."

    "abstract": "To examine the timing of operative management and interhospital transfer of emergency general surgical patients in a regional setting. Retrospective cohort study. The surgical unit at a major rural referral centre for North-Eastern Victoria servicing a population of 90 000. General surgical patients (n = 649) admitted via the emergency department at Northeast Health Wangaratta between January 2011 and March 2013 undergoing operative management (n = 608) or transfer to a tertiary centre (n = 44). Timing of operative management, using appendicectomy as a benchmark operation, was measured as time from presentation to decision to operate, time from decision to surgery, percentage after-hours operating and length of stay (LOS). Time to interhospital transfer was calculated and reasons for delay were sought. Two hundred forty-six appendicectomies were performed. Median time from decision to operate to theatre was 3 hours (interquartile range (IQR) 2-8), and total LOS was 43 hours (IQR: 28-56). Two hundred seventy-two procedures (43%) were performed out-of-hours, including 48% of appendicectomies. Median time from decision making to transfer was 10.3 hours (IQR: 4.7-25). Transfer was less likely to be delayed in trauma patients when compared with urgent non-trauma patients (5.3 versus 10.6 hours; P = 0.04). Even in the absence of a strict four-hour rule program and a dedicated emergency surgical unit, main outcome measures appear to be comparatively efficient. However, the duration for transfer of patients is suboptimal because of the lack of established pathways for urgent non-trauma transfer from rural centres and bed availability in tertiary hospitals."

    "abstract": "The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) recently established a grading system for uniform reporting of anatomic severity of several emergency general surgery (EGS) diseases. There are five grades of severity for each disease, ranging from I (lowest severity) to V (highest severity). However, the grading process requires manual chart review. We sought to evaluate whether International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revisions, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM) codes might allow estimation of AAST grades for EGS diseases. The Patient Assessment and Outcomes Committee of the AAST reviewed all available ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes relevant to 16 EGS diseases with available AAST grades. We then matched grades for each EGS disease with one or more ICD codes. We used the Official Coding Guidelines for ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM and the American Hospital Association's \"Coding Clinic for ICD-9-CM\" for coding guidance. The ICD codes did not allow for matching all five AAST grades of severity for each of the 16 diseases. With ICD-9-CM, six diseases mapped into four categories of severity (instead of five), another six diseases into three categories of severity, and four diseases into only two categories of severity. With ICD-10-CM, five diseases mapped into four categories of severity, seven diseases into three categories, and four diseases into two categories. Two diseases mapped into discontinuous categories of grades (two in ICD-9-CM and one in ICD-10-CM). Although resolution is limited, ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes might have some utility in roughly approximating the severity of the AAST grades in the absence of more precise information. These ICD mappings should be validated and refined before widespread use to characterize EGS disease severity. In the long-term, it may be desirable to develop alternatives to ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for routine collection of disease severity characteristics."

    "abstract": "To determine whether plateau pressure (Pplat) measurement is lowered and peak airway pressure (Pawpeak)-to-Plat gradient is increased by measurement on a decelerating compared with square gas delivery wave form. Prospective before and after study of mechanically ventilated injured and critically ill patients in an adult surgical intensive care unit. Pplat, Pawpeak, and Pawpeak-to-Pplat gradient were measured on decelerating and square gas delivery wave forms. Pplat and other routine ventilator parameters were measured in 82 (47 trauma, 35 emergency general surgery) consecutive convenience sampled adult intensive care unit patients on decelerating and then square gas delivery wave forms. Peak gas flow was fixed at 40 L/min; all other parameters (rate, tidal volume, positive end-expiratory pressure) were held constant. All patients were managed on assist control volume cycled ventilation using fentanyl and midazolam or propofol; no neuromuscular blockade was used. Patients with Pawpeak more than 35 cm H2O were excluded. Comparing decelerating with square gas delivery, mean Pawpeak was lower (25.1 ± 2.3 cm H2O vs. 33.1 ± 2.1 cm H2O; p < 0.0001) and mean Pplat was lower (21.3 ± 1.9 cm H2O vs. 24.8 ± 2.5 cm H2O; p < 0.0001), resulting in a decreased Pawpeak-to-Pplat gradient (3.8 ± 2.1 vs. 8.3 ± 2.3; p < 0.0001). Changing from a decelerating to a square gas delivery wave form significantly increases Pplat and Pawpeak, thereby increasing the Pawpeak-to-Pplat gradient. This increase may prompt unwarranted therapy aimed at reducing the gradient to its normal value of 4 cm H2O pressure or less. Conversely, patients with a high Pawpeak on a square wave form may benefit from transitioning to a decelerating wave form before changing ventilation parameters. Diagnostic study, level III."

    "abstract": "The relative contribution of specific postoperative complications on mortality after emergency operations has not been previously described. Identifying specific contributors to postoperative mortality following acute care surgery will allow for significant improvement in the care of these patients. Patients from the 2005 to 2011 American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database who underwent emergency operation by a general surgeon for one of seven diagnoses (gallbladder disease, gastroduodenal ulcer disease, intestinal ischemia, intestinal obstruction, intestinal perforation, diverticulitis, and abdominal wall hernia) were analyzed. Postoperative complications (pneumonia, myocardial infarction, incisional surgical site infection, organ/space surgical site infection, thromboembolic process, urinary tract infection, stroke, or major bleeding) were chosen based on surgical outcome measures monitored by national quality improvement initiatives and regulatory bodies. Regression techniques were used to determine the independent association between these complications and 30-day mortality, after adjustment for an array of patient- and procedure-related variables. Emergency operations accounted for 14.6% of the approximately 1.2 million general surgery procedures that are included in American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program but for 53.5% of the 19,094 postoperative deaths. A total of 43,429 emergency general surgery patients were analyzed. Incisional surgical site infection had the highest incidence (6.7%). The second most common complication was pneumonia (5.7%). Stroke, major bleeding, myocardial infarction, and pneumonia exhibited the strongest associations with postoperative death. Given its disproportionate contribution to surgical mortality, emergency surgery represents an ideal focus for quality improvement. Of the potential postoperative targets for quality improvement, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, stroke, and major bleeding have the strongest associations with subsequent mortality. Since pneumonia is both relatively common after emergency surgery and strongly associated with postoperative death, it should receive priority as a target for surgical quality improvement initiatives.

We conducted a qualitative study comprising face-to-face interviews with senior surgeons responsible for ACS at 18 teaching hospitals chosen to ensure diversity of opinions and practice environment (three practice types [community, public or charity, and university] in each of six geographic regions [Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New England, Northeast, South, and West]). Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using NVivo (QSR International, Melbourne, Australia). We applied the methods of investigator triangulation using an inductive approach to develop a final taxonomy of codes organized by themes related to respondents' views on the future of ACS as a strategy for EGS. We applied our findings to a conceptual model on diffusion of innovation. We found a paradox between ACS viewed as a health care delivery innovation versus a rebranding of comprehensive general surgery. Optimism for the future of ACS because of increased desirability for trauma and critical care careers as well as improved EGS outcomes was tempered by fear over lack of continuity, poor institutional resources, and uncertainty regarding financial viability. Our analysis suggests that the implementation of ACS, whether a true health care delivery innovation or an innovative rebranding, fits into the Rogers' diffusion of innovation theory. Despite concerns over resource allocation and the definition of the specialty, from the perspective of senior surgeons deeply entrenched in executing this care delivery model, ACS represents the new face of general surgery that will likely continue to diffuse from these early adopters."

    "abstract": "The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) recently developed a grading scale for measuring anatomic severity of emergency general surgery (EGS) diseases. Grades were developed by expert consensus and have not been validated. The study purpose was to measure inter-rater reliability of the grading scale using colonic diverticulitis and to measure the association between disease grade and patient outcomes. All charts were reviewed and independently assigned AAST grades based on specific disease criteria. Inter-rater reliability was measured using a kappa coefficient. Multivariate regression models were used to determine the relationship between AAST disease grade and patient outcomes adjusted for age, comorbidities, and patient physiology. Over 70% of patients demonstrated mild disease (grades I and II). No deaths were encountered. Inter-rater reliability for grade assignment was moderate (kappa coefficient, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.56), with 67% concordance in grades. Compared to grade I, complications were similar in grade II but increased significantly with higher grades (grade III odds ratio [OR], 3.13 [1.32-7.41]; grade IV OR, 8.18 [2.09-32.0]; and grade V OR, 10.2 [2.68-38.90]). Compared to grade I, length of stay increased with higher grades (grade II incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.30 [1.07-1.60]; grade III IRR, 2.4 [1.93-2.98]; grade IV IRR, 3.2 [2.27-4.60]; and grade V IRR, 2.6 [1.82-3.60]). The EGS grading scale for diverticulitis demonstrated moderate inter-rater reliability. Higher grades were independently associated with complications and length of stay.

Seasonal variation in medical conditions is well established; however, its impact on EGS cases remains unclear. The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was queried over an 8-year period (2004-2011) for all patients with diagnosis of acute appendicitis, acute cholecystitis, and diverticulitis. Elective admissions were excluded. The following data for each admission were recorded: age, sex, race, admission month, major operative procedure, hospital region, and mortality. Seasons were defined as follows: Spring (March, April, May), Summer (June, July, August), Fall (September, October, November), and Winter (December, January, February). X11 procedure and spectral analysis were performed to confirm seasonal variation. A total of 63,911,033 admission records were evaluated of which 493,569 were appendicitis, 395,838 were cholecystitis, and 412,163 were diverticulitis. Seasonal variation is confirmed in EGS (F = 159.12, P < 0.0001) admissions. In the subanalysis, seasonal variation was found in acute appendicitis (F = 119.62, P < 0.0001), acute cholecystitis (F = 37.13, P < 0.0001), and diverticulitis (F = 69.90, P < 0.0001). The average monthly EGS admission in Winter was 11,322 ± 674. The average monthly EGS admission in Summer was higher than that of Winter by 13.6% (n = 1542; 95% CI: 1180-1904, P < 0.001). Hospitalization due to EGS adheres to a consistent cyclical pattern, with more admissions occurring during the Summer months. Although the reasons for this variability are unknown, this information may be useful for hospital resource reallocation and staffing."

The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2008-2010 was used to create a cohort of inpatients who underwent emergency appendectomy, cholecystectomy, or herniorrhaphy. Outcomes measured included length of stay, charge, cost, death in hospital, complications, and failure to rescue (FTR). Univariate and logistic regression analysis was performed to associate variables with outcomes. A total of 187,913 emergency general surgery cases were identified, 11.5% of which were performed at safety net hospitals. The safety net cohort had increased length of stay but lower mean charge and cost. Age, comorbidity score, black race, male gender, and Medicaid and Medicare insurance were associated with mortality, complication, and FTR. Lower socioeconomic status was associated with mortality and complication. Safety net status was positively associated with complication but not mortality or FTR. Safety net hospitals had higher complication rates but no difference in FTR or mortality. This may mean that the hospitals are able to effectively recognize and treat patient complications and do so without increased cost."

We hypothesized that a patient subset could be identified that requires a level of care beyond general surgical training and justifies creation of this new specialty. Reviewed patient admissions over 1-y to the only general surgical service at a level I trauma center-staffed by trauma and/or critical care trained physicians. Patients classified as follows: trauma, ACS, emergency general (EGS), or elective surgery. ACS patients are nonelective, nontrauma patients with significantly altered physiology requiring intensive care unit admission and/or specific complex operative interventions. Differences in demographics, hospital course, and outcomes were analyzed. In-patient service evaluated approximately 5500 patients, including 3300 trauma patients. A total of 2152 admissions include 37% trauma, 30% elective, 28% EGS, and 4% ACS. ACS and trauma patients were more likely to require multiple operations (ACS relative risk [RR] = 11.5; trauma RR = 5.7, P < 0.0001), have longer hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, and higher mortality (P < 0.0001). They were less likely to be discharged home (ACS RR = 0.75; trauma RR = 0.67, P < 0.0001) compared with that of the EGS group. EGS and elective patients were most similar to each other in multiple areas. ACS and EGS patients represent distinct patient cohorts, as reflected by significant differences in critical care needs, likelihood of multiple operations, and need for postdischarge rehabilitation. The skills required to care for ACS patients, including ability to rescue from complications and provide critical care, differ from those required for EGS patients and supports development of ACS training and regionalization of care."

We hypothesized that mortality would be lower for EGS patients treated at a TC vs non-TC (NTC). A retrospective review of the Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission database from 2009 to 2013 was performed. The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma EGS ICD-9 codes were used to identify EGS patients. Data collected included demographics, TC designation, emergency department admissions, and All Patients Refined Severity of Illness (APR_SOI). Trauma center designation was used as a marker of a formal acute care surgery program. Primary outcomes included in-hospital mortality. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed controlling for age. There were 817,942 EGS encounters. Mean ± SD age of patients was 60.1 ± 18.7 years, 46.5% were males; 71.1% of encounters were at NTCs; and 75.8% were emergency department admissions. Overall mortality was 4.05%. Mortality was calculated based on TC designation controlling for age across APR_SOI strata. Multivariable logistic regression analysis did not show statistically significant differences in mortality between hospital levels for minor APR_SOI. For moderate APR_SOI, mortality was significantly lower for TCs compared with NTCs (p < 0.001). Among TCs, the effect was strongest for Level I TC (odds ratio = 0.34). For extreme APR_SOI, mortality was higher at TCs vs NTCs (p < 0.001). Emergency general surgery patients treated at TCs had lower mortality for moderate APR_SOI, but increased mortality for extreme APR_SOI when compared with NTCs.

A retrospective chart review of emergency general surgery admissions in 2010 was conducted. Patients who had surgery were identified. Mode of surgery and CACI were recorded, as well as measures of outcome, including 30-day mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. A multivariate stepwise logistic regression model was created to assess the effect of age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index on postoperative outcomes while controlling for the effect of possible confounders. The prediction ability of CACI for mortality was assessed using receiver operating characteristic analyses considering the area under the curve and its 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Of the 529 admissions to general surgery from the emergency department, 257 patients underwent a surgical intervention. The CACI scores ranged from 0 to 16. We described a total of 11 deaths (4.3%) and 30 ICU admissions (11.7%). CACI was associated with an increased risk of 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio,1.39; 95% CI, 1.11-1.73; p = 0.0034). Receiver operating characteristic analysis was consistent with high accuracy of CACI for mortality prediction alone, resulting in area under the curve or c statistic of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.84-0.95). CACI was similar in predicting mortality to a multivariate model. CACI was also found to be associated with ICU admission (adjusted odds ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.01-1.37; p < 0.0382). CACI is not as good a predictor for ICU admission when compared with the multivariate model.

The aim of this study was to quantify the excess burden of morbidity and mortality associated with EGS by controlling for patient-specific factors. We hypothesized that EGS is an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality. We retrospectively analyzed data from the American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. Fourteen procedures common to both EGS and NEGS from 2008 through 2012 were included. Patients were stratified based on emergency status. The primary outcome was death within 30 days of operation. Secondary outcomes were postoperative complications. Variables from the American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program preoperative risk assessment were analyzed. χ and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare variables. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors for mortality and complications. Of 66,665 patients, 24,068 were EGS and 42,597 were NEGS. Mortality was 12.50% for EGS patients and 2.66% for NEGS patients (p < 0.0001). Major complications occurred in 32.80% of EGS patients and 12.74% of NEGS patients (p < 0.0001). When preoperative variables and procedure type were controlled, EGS was independently associated with death (odds ratio, 1.39; p = 0.029) and major complications (odds ratio, 1.31; p = 0.001).

A systematic review was performed for studies comparing outcomes after emergency laparotomy using stapled versus handsewn anastomosis until July 2014 (PROSPERO registry number: CRD42013006183). The primary endpoint was anastomotic failure, a composite measure of leak, abscess and fistula. Odds ratio (OR; with 95% CI) and weighted mean differences were calculated using meta-analytical techniques. Subgroup analysis was conducted for trauma surgery (TS) and emergency general surgery (EGS) cohorts. Risk of bias for each study was calculated using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for cohort studies, and Cochrane Collaboration's tool for randomized trials. The final analysis included 7 studies of 1,120 patients, with a total of 1,205 anastomoses. There were 5 TS studies and 2 EGS studies. There were no differences in anastomotic failure between handsewn and stapled techniques on an individual anastomosis level (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 0.97-2.43; P = .070), or on an individual patient level (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 0.92-2.25; P = .110). There were no differences in the individual rates of anastomotic leak, abscess, fistulae, or postoperative deaths between techniques. Subgroup analysis of EGS and TS studies demonstrated no superior operative technique. Available evidence is sparse and at high risk of bias, and neither stapling nor handsewing is justifiably favored in emergency laparotomy. Surgeons might therefore select the technique of their own choice with caution owing to unresolved uncertainty."

However, similar work has yet to be done for factors affecting outcomes of emergency general surgery (EGS). The objective of this study was to determine the predictors of in-hospital complications and mortality among EGS patients. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2003-2011) was queried for patients with conditions encompassing EGS as determined by the American Association for Surgery of Trauma, categorizing them into predefined EGS groups using DRG International Classification of Diseases-9th Rev.-Clinical Modification codes. Primary outcomes considered included incidence of a major complication (pneumonia, pulmonary emboli, urinary tract infections, myocardial infarctions, sepsis, or septic shock) and in-hospital mortality. Separate multivariate logistic regression analyses for complications and mortality were performed to identify risk factors of either outcome from the following domains: patient demographics (age, sex, insurance type, race, and income quartile), comorbidities, and hospital characteristics (location, teaching status, and bed size). This study included 6,712,151 discharge records, weighted to represent 32,910,446 visits for EGS conditions. Mean age was 58.50 (19.74) years; slightly more than half (54.66%) were female. Uninsured patients were more likely to die (odds ratio,1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-1.30), whereas patients in the highest income quartile had the least likelihood of mortality (odds ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.84-0.87). Old age was an independent predictor of mortality for all EGS subdiagnoses. The overall mortality rate was 1.76%; the overall complication rate was 10.03%. Of the patients who died, 62% experienced at least one major complication. Patients requiring resuscitation had the highest likelihood of mortality followed by patients with vascular disease and hepatic disease. Death patterns of EGS patients were discerned using an administrative data set. Understanding patterns of mortality and complications derived from studies such as this could improve hospital benchmarking for EGS, akin to trauma surgery's previous success.

    "abstract": "Abdominal complications following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) procedures may have mortality rates as high as 25%. Advanced procedures such as ventricular assist devices, artificial hearts and cardiac transplantation are being increasingly employed, changing the complexity of interventions. This study was undertaken to examine the changing trends in complications and the impact of cardiac surgery on emergency general surgery (EGS) coverage. A retrospective review was conducted of all CPB procedures admitted to our ICU between Jan. 2007 and Mar. 2010. The procedures included coronary bypass (CABG), valve, combination (including adult congenital) and advanced heart failure (AHF) procedures. The records were reviewed to obtain demographics, need for EGS consult/procedure and outcomes. Mean age of the patients was 66 ± 8.5 years, 71% were male. There were 945 CPB procedures performed on 914 patients during this study period. Over 39 months, 23 EGS consults were obtained, resulting in 10 operations and one hospital death (10% operative mortality). CABG and valve procedures had minimal impact on EGS workload while complex cardiac and AHF procedures accounted for significantly more EGS consultations (p < 0.005) and operations (p < 0.005). The majority of consultations were for small bowel obstruction/ileus (n = 4, 17%), cholecystitis (n = 3, 13%) and to rule out ischemia (n = 2, 9%) In the era of modern critical care and cardiac surgery, advanced technology has increased the volume of complex CPB procedures increasing the EGS workload. Emergency general surgeons working in institutions that perform advanced procedures should be aware of the potential for general surgical complications perioperatively and the resultant nuances that are associated with operative management in this patient population."

    "abstract": "Agenesis of the inferior vena cava is an extremely rare abnormality, most often discovered by accident. This paper reports the case of a 41-year-old male patient, admitted to the IIIrd Emergency General Surgery Clinic of the Emergency University Hospital with the diagnosis of bilateral pelvic limb post-thrombotic syndrome. According to his personal history he had the first vascular surgical intervention at the age of 6. The surgical indication was determined by large hydrostatic varicoseveins of the lower limbs and the performed surgery was cosectomy with bilateral stripping of the great saphenousvein. Until admission to our clinic, the patient had repeated surgery for recurrent varicose veins of the lower limbs. The patient was diagnosed in our service with congenital agenesis of inferior vena cava, the evolution was good and the patient was discharged after 17 days. This paper presents the clinical,imagistic and therapeutic particularities of such a case. Imagistic detection of early vascular abnormality, identifying procoagulant factors and the close care of the local lesion areessential for patient evolution."

    "abstract": "Trauma and emergency surgery continues to evolve as a surgical niche. The simple fact that The Journal of Trauma is now entitled The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery captures this reality. We sought to characterize the niche that trauma and emergency surgeons have occupied during the maturation of the acute care surgery model. We analyzed the University Health System Consortium-Association of American Medical Colleges Faculty Practice Solutions Center database for the years 2007 to 2012 for specific current procedural terminology (CPT) codes. This database includes coding and billing data for more than 90 academic medical centers throughout the United States. We analyzed frequency counts and work relative value units (wRVUs) generated for specific codes to characterize the average trauma and emergency surgeon's work experience over time. We found that acute care surgeons generated 42.4% of wRVUs from procedural work and 57.6% from cognitive work. For cognitive work, critical care services generated the most wRVUs per year (25.2% of total), and subsequent hospital care was the most frequently performed activity (1,236.6 codes generated per year). For procedural work, laparoscopic cholecystectomies produced the most wRVUs per year (2.4% of total), and placement of a nontunneled catheter was the most frequently performed procedure (42.2 times per year). The average acute care surgeon performed the following numbers of procedures per year: 29.6 cholecystectomies and 20.0 appendectomies; 7.7 wound vacuum device changes; 5.9 implantation of mesh procedures; 4.9 splenectomies and 0.4 splenorrhaphies; 2.6 perirectal abscess drainage procedures; less than one component separation fascial hernia repair; and less than one video-assisted thoracic surgery. The modern acute care surgeon is a hybrid of critical care medicine physician and ever-evolving surgical interventionist. Acute care surgeons continue to do traditional trauma work while increasingly performing acute care surgeries. The work of acute care surgeons serves a growing role and fills a valuable niche in our health care system."

    "abstract": "Previous analyses demonstrate teaching hospitals to have worse outcomes raising concerns for quality of care. The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes between teaching and nonteaching hospitals for emergency surgical conditions in a national sample. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2005-2011) was queried for patients with emergency general surgery (EGS) conditions as determined by the American Association for Surgery of Trauma. Outcomes of in-hospital mortality, major complications, length of stay (LOS) and hospital cost were compared between patients presenting to teaching versus nonteaching hospitals. Propensity scores were used to match both groups on demographics, clinical diagnosis, comorbidities, and disease severity. Multivariate regression analyses were performed further adjusting for hospital-level factors including EGS volume. Small effect estimates were further tested using standardized differences. A total of 3,707,465 patients from 3,163 centers were included. A majority of patients (59%) (n = 2,187,107) were treated at nonteaching hospitals. After propensity score matching and adjustment, teaching hospitals had a slightly higher odds likelihood of mortality (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.06), slightly lower rate of major complications (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-0.99), slightly decreased LOS (5.03 days [4.98-5.09] vs. 5.22 days [5.16-5.29]), and slightly higher hospital costs [$12,846 [$12,827-$12,865] vs. $12,304 [12,290-12,318]). Although these differences were statistically significant at p < 0.05, the absolute difference was very small. Further testing of these effect estimates using standardized differences revealed an insignificant difference of 0.5% for mortality, 0.4% for major complications, 0.2% for LOS, and 3.1% for hospital cost. National estimates of outcomes for EGS conditions demonstrate comparable results between teaching and nonteaching hospitals. Concerns regarding quality of care and higher costs at teaching hospitals may be unfounded. Further research to test for differences by specific EGS conditions, operative management, and hospital costs are warranted."

    "abstract": "To date, no studies have reported nationwide adoption of acute care surgery (ACS) or identified structural and/or process variations for the care of emergency general surgery (EGS) patients within such models. We surveyed surgeons responsible for EGS coverage at University Health Systems Consortium hospitals using an eight-page postal/e-mail questionnaire querying respondents on hospital and EGS structure/process measures. Survey responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics, univariate comparisons, and multivariable regression models. Of 319 potential respondents, 258 (81%) completed the surveys. A total of 81 hospitals (31%) had implemented ACS, while 134 (52%) had a traditional general surgeon on-call (GSOC) model. Thirty-eight hospitals (15%) had another model (hybrid). Larger-bed, university-based, teaching hospitals with Level 1 trauma center verification status located in urban areas were more likely to have adopted ACS. In multivariable modeling, hospital type, setting, and trauma center verification predicted ACS implementation. EGS processes of care varied, with 28% of the GSOC hospitals having block time versus 67% of the ACS hospitals (p < 0.0001), 45% of the GSOC hospitals providing ICU [intensive care unit] care to EGS patients in a surgical/trauma ICU versus 93% of the ACS hospitals (p < 0.0001), 5.7 ± 3.2 surgeons sharing call at GSOC hospitals versus 7.9 ± 2.3 surgeons at ACS hospitals (p < 0.0001), and 13% of the GSOC hospitals requiring in-house EGS call versus 75% of the ACS hospitals (p < 0.0001). Among ACS hospitals, there were variations in patient cohorting (EGS patients alone, 25%; EGS + trauma, 21%; EGS + elective, 17%; and EGS + trauma + elective, 30%), data collection (26% had prospective EGS registries), patient hand-offs (56% had attending surgeon presence), and call responsibilities (averaging 4.8 ± 1.3 calls per month, with 60% providing extra call stipend and 40% with no postcall clinical duties). The potential of the ACS on the national crisis in access to EGS care is not fully met. Variations in EGS processes of care among adopters of ACS suggest that standardized criteria for ACS implementation, much like trauma center verification criteria, may be beneficial."

    "abstract": "Acute care surgery (ACS) programs have emerged mainly at academic medical centers to provide timely care for emergency general surgery and trauma patients. We hypothesized that the development of an ACS program in a multispecialty group practice would improve outcomes for patients with acute appendicitis. A retrospective analysis of patients with acute appendicitis was performed in two time periods: 18 months of private practice and the following 12 months with ACS coverage. Length of stay was the primary outcome measure. A total of 871 patients were studied (526 private practice, 345 ACS). The ACS group had a greater proportion of laparoscopic appendectomies (P < 0.001) and more transitions in care between surgeons (P < 0.001). Length of stay was shorter in the ACS group (1.6 ± 1.5 [mean ± standard deviation] vs 1.9 ± 2.4 days, P = 0.01) and a greater proportion of surgeries were performed during the daytime (44.9 vs 36.6%, P = 0.02). Multivariate analysis demonstrated length of stay was related to appendicitis grade (P < 0.001), American Society of Anesthesiologists class (P < 0.001), symptom duration (P = 0.001), and laparoscopic approach (P < 0.001). The initial transition from private practice to ACS resulted in decreased length of stay with no increase in morbidity related to transitions of surgical care in patients with appendicitis."

Charts from all patients undergoing colon resection for CDD during emergent hospital admission at a single academic institution were reviewed. The primary outcomes were overall 30-day postoperative morbidity and mortality. From 2000 to 2010, 125 cases were retrieved (49 LCR and 86 OCR). Conversion rate was 5.1%. Overall morbidity significantly decreased with laparoscopic surgery compared with OCR. No mortality occurred with LCR. Prolonged ileus was less frequent (12.8% vs. 32.6%; P = .02), time to oral intake shorter (3 vs. 6 days; P < .01), and LOS shorter (5 vs. 8 days; P = .05) for LCR.

We tried to delineate the impact of the ACS model on surgical efficiency and quality. Before the ACS model was implemented, abdominal surgical emergencies were evaluated by an on-call nontrauma general surgeon (pre-ACS model). An in-house trauma surgeon treated all patients with trauma or nontrauma abdominal surgical emergencies after the ACS model. Patients with acute appendicitis who underwent appendectomies were included. We conducted a pre- and poststudy to compare the time patients were in the emergency department and surgical qualities. There were 146 and 159 patients enrolled in the pre-ACS model and ACS model, respectively. The overall ED length of stay in the ACS model was significantly shorter than that in the pre-ACS model (300.3 ± 61.7 vs 719.1 ± 339.0 minutes, P < .001). Hospital LOS was also significantly shorter in the ACS model than in the pre-ACS model (2.44 ± 1.39 vs 3.83 ± 2.21 days, P = .022). The ACS model may improve abdominal surgical efficiency and quality. Our study results echoed the benefits of the implementation of the ACS model shown in North America."

Our objective is to investigate prognostic risk factors from patient level characteristics and clinical presentation to predict outcomes including mortality, postoperative complications, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and prolonged duration of hospital stay. Retrospective review of all emergency general surgery admissions over a 1-year period at a large teaching hospital was conducted. Factors collected included history of present illness, physical exam and laboratory parameters at presentation. Univariate analysis was performed to examine the relationship between each variable and our outcomes with chi-square for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank-sum statistic for continuous variables. Multivariate analysis was performed using backward stepwise logistic regression to evaluate for independent predictors. A total of 527 ACS admissions were identified with 8.1% requiring ICU stay and an overall crude mortality rate of 3.04%. Operative management was required in 258 patients with 22% having postoperative complications. Use of anti-coagulants, systolic blood pressure <90, hypothermia and leukopenia were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Leukopenia, smoking and tachycardia at presentation were also prognostic for the development of postoperative complications. For ICU admission, use of anti-coagulants, leukopenia, leukocytosis and tachypnea at presentation were all independent predictive factors. A prolonged length of stay was associated with increasing age, higher American Society of Anesthesiologists class, tachycardia and presence of complications on multivariate analysis. Factors present at initial presentation can be used to predict morbidity and mortality in ACS patients."

    "abstract": "The Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCS) published guidance in 2011 setting standards for the management of emergency surgical patients with the aim of reducing surgical mortality. These suggested the presence of a consultant surgeon and anaesthetist, and transfer to a higher level of care postoperatively for all patients deemed high risk. This prospective multi-institutional study sought to evaluate whether adherence to these standards was associated with reduced mortality. Data were prospectively collected on all emergency general surgery operations performed in emergency theatres across Merseyside, UK, during a 30-day period in September-October 2011. Patients were risk assessed using P-POSSUM (Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enUmeration of Mortality and morbidity). High-risk patients were classified as those with a P-POSSUM predicted mortality of ≥10 %, and moderate-risk patients as those with a P-POSSUM predicted mortality of 5-10 %. Some 494 procedures were performed on 471 patients. Twenty-four patients (5 %) died within 30 days of surgery. Mortality in the 65 patients identified as high risk was 27 % (14 patients undergoing 17 procedures), with a consultant surgeon present in 46 of 65 high-risk cases (71 %), a consultant anaesthetist in 43 (66 %), and 46 (71 %) cases were admitted to level 2 or 3 care postoperatively. There was no association between adherence to standards and postoperative mortality in either the whole cohort or specifically the high-risk group. There is currently incomplete adherence to the national guidelines, but this does not seem to adversely impact postoperative mortality."

The epidemiological evidence base in acute general surgery in the older person is sparse. This is the first assessment of the prevalence of cognitive impairment measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment tool (MoCA) in acute general surgery. In three sites in Wales, England and Scotland comprising rural and urban populations, we studied consecutive patients aged over 65 years. We considered any older person admitted to the acute general surgical unit. We assessed them for baseline demographic data. They each underwent a MoCA assessment. We collected data on 245 people, mean age 76.9 years (8.1, standard deviation), 136 (55.5%) were women. Of these 201 completed the MoCA test, mean score of 18.9 and median score 20 (range 0-30).

Increasing age (p < 0.01) but not sex (p = 0.14) predicted an abnormal MoCA. Considering only the 44 people who were unable to attempt the MoCA assessment, 11 (25%) were known to have a diagnosis of dementia, 9 (20.5%) were too unwell and the remainder unable to complete the assessment to due pre-existing disability.

The Clavien-Dindo classification has been developed and validated in elective general surgical patients, but has not been validated in emergency surgical patients. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications in emergency surgical patients and to study preoperative factors for risk stratification that should be included into a database of surgical complications. A cohort of 444 consecutive patients having emergency general surgery during a three-month period was retrospectively analyzed. Surgical complications were classified according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Preoperative risk factors for complications were studied using logistic regression analysis. Preoperatively 37 (8.3%) patients had organ dysfunctions. Emergency surgical patients required a new definition for Grade IV complications (organ dysfunctions). Only new onset organ dysfunctions or complications that significantly contributed to worsening of pre-operative organ dysfunctions were classified as grade IV complications. Postoperative complications developed in 115 (25.9%) patients, and 14 (3.2%) patients developed grade IV complication. Charlson comorbidity index, preoperative organ dysfunction and the type of surgery predicted postoperative complications. The Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications can be used in emergency surgical patients but preoperative organ dysfunctions should be taken into account when defining postoperative grade IV complications. For risk stratification patients' comorbidities, preoperative organ dysfunctions and the type of surgery should be taken into consideration."

The 2 groups (ASP group vs No ASP group) were matched in a 1:1 ratio for age, sex, previous abdominal surgeries, and comorbidities. Primary outcome measures were intraoperative hemorrhage, postoperative anemia, need for blood transfusion, and conversion to open cholecystectomy. Intraoperative hemorrhage was defined as intraoperative blood loss of ≥ 100 mL; postoperative anemia was defined by ≥ 2 g/dL drop in hemoglobin. A total of 112 (ASP: 56, no ASP: 56) patients were included in the analysis. The mean age was 65.9 ± 10 years, and 50% were male. There was no difference in age (P = .9), sex (P = .9), and comorbidities (P = .7) between the 2 groups. There was no difference in intraoperative blood loss >100 mL (P = .5), postoperative anemia (P = .8), blood transfusion requirement (P = .9), and conversion to open surgery (P = .7) between patients on American Society of Anesthesiologists therapy and patients not on American Society of Anesthesiologists therapy. Emergent laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe procedure in patients on long-term ASP. Prehospital use of ASP as an independent factor should not be used to delay emergent cholecystectomy."

This has resulted in a gap in the provision of emergency surgical care. The Acute Care Surgery (ACS) fellowship, incorporating trauma, critical care, and emergency general surgery, was developed to address this need. One of the most important aspects in establishing these ACS fellowships is that they do not detract from the existing general surgery residents' experience. The operative case logs for residents and fellows were compared for the number of resident cases during the 3 years before the ACS fellowship and during the 3 years after the fellowship was established. Surveys were distributed to the general surgery residents addressing the impact of the fellows from the resident's perspective at the end of the 2011 to 2012 academic year. There was no significant change in the number of total cases; total chief resident cases; and trauma, thoracic, or vascular procedures done per graduate. A decrease in the number of liver cases performed by the residents was noted but includes the increase in resident complement as well as the fellowship. ACS fellow cases increased from 172 cases in the first year to 221 cases in the second year and 295 in the third year. The survey showed that the residents had a very positive response to having the fellow as a teacher and did not feel like their operative experience was compromised with the addition of the ACS fellowship. The ACS fellow did not compromise general surgery resident experience and was regarded as an asset to the resident's education. An ACS fellowship can be beneficial to residents and fellows.

The growth of acute care surgery has emphasized this public health problem, yet the true \"burden of disease\" remains unknown. Building on efforts by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma to standardize an EGS definition, we sought to describe the burden of disease for EGS in the United States. We hypothesize that EGS patients represent a large, diverse, and challenging cohort and that the burden is increasing. The study population was selected from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, 2001 to 2010, using the AAST EGS DRG International Classification of Diseases-9th Rev. codes, selecting all EGS patients 18 years or older with urgent/emergent admission status. Rates for operations, mortality, and sepsis were compiled along with hospital type, length of stay, insurance, and demographic data. The χ test, the t test, and the Cochran-Armitage trend test were used; p < 0.05 was significant. From 2001 to 2010, there were 27,668,807 EGS admissions, 7.1% of all hospitalizations. The population-adjusted case rate for 2010 was 1,290 admissions per 100,000 people (95% confidence interval, 1,288.9-1,291.8). The mean age was 58.7 years; most had comorbidities. A total of 7,979,578 patients (28.8%) required surgery. During 10 years, admissions increased by 27.5%; operations, by 32.3%; and sepsis cases, by 15% (p < 0.0001). Mortality and length of stay both decreased (p < 0.0001). Medicaid and uninsured rates increased by a combined 38.1% (p < 0.0001). Nearly 85% were treated in urban hospitals, and nearly 40% were treated in teaching hospitals; both increased over time (p < 0.0001). The EGS burden of disease is substantial and is increasing. The annual case rate (1,290 of 100,000) is higher than the sum of all new cancer diagnoses (all ages/types): 650 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval, 370.1-371.7), yet the public health implications remain largely unstudied.

This investigation examines the outcomes in very elderly patients undergoing emergency general surgery, including predictors of in-hospital mortality and morbidity. A retrospective study of patients aged 80 and above undergoing emergency surgery between 2008 and 2010 at a tertiary care facility in Canada was conducted. Demographics, comorbidities, surgical indications, and perioperative risk assessment data were collected. Outcomes included length of hospitalization, discharge destination, and in-hospital mortality and morbidity. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality and complications. Of the 170 patient admissions, the mean age was 84 years and the in-hospital mortality rate was 14.7%. Comorbidities were present in 91% of this older patient population. Over 60% of the patients required further services or alternate level of care on discharge. American Society of Anesthesiologist Physical Status (ASA) Classification (OR 5.30, 95% CI 1.774-15.817, p = 0.003) and the development of an in-hospital complications (OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.210-5.187, p = 0.013) were independent predictors of postoperative mortality. Chronological age or number of comorbidities was not predictive of surgical outcome. Mortality, complication rates and post-discharge care requirements were high in very elderly patients undergoing emergency general surgery. Advanced age and medical comorbidities alone should not be the limiting factors for surgical referral or treatment. This study illustrates the importance of preventing an in-hospital complication in this very vulnerable population. ASA class is a robust tool which is predictive of mortality in the very elderly population and can be used to guide patient and family counseling in the emergency setting."

The aim of this study was to assess the presence of burnout syndrome in the middle grade doctors in a tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia. The study was conducted at the Armed Forces Hospital Southern Region, Khamis Mushyt, from August to October 2012 in departments with at least fifty inpatient admissions per month and with at least five middle grade (Resident, Registrar and Senior Registrar) doctors. The departments were Obstetrics and Gynecology, Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Emergency, General Surgery and Nephrology. This was a cross sectional descriptive and analytical study using the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Health Services Survey and a self-reported stressor-identifying questionnaire to ascertain possible precursors of, or contributing factors to, Burnout Syndrome. A total of 96 proformas/questionnaires were collected anonymously to maintain confidentiality and burnout syndrome was identified in as high as 88.5% of the respondents with high emotional exhaustion in 68.8%, high depersonalization in 63.6% and low personal accomplishment in 38.5%. The authors concluded that burnout syndrome is high among the middle-grade doctors in this medical facility and that urgent steps are needed to address this problem to ensure that these physicians remain physically and mentally healthy."

    "title": "Sarcopenia is a predictor of outcomes in very elderly patients undergoing emergency surgery.",
    "abstract": "With the increasing aging population, the number of very elderly patients (age ≥80 years) undergoing emergency operations is increasing. Evaluating patient-specific risk factors for postoperative morbidity and mortality in the acute care surgery setting is crucial to improving outcomes. We hypothesize that sarcopenia, a severe depletion of skeletal muscles, is a predictor of morbidity and mortality in very elderly patients undergoing emergency surgery. A total of 170 patients older than the age of 80 underwent emergency surgery between 2008 and 2010 at a tertiary care facility; 100 of these patients had abdominal computed tomography images within 30 days of the operation that were adequate for the assessment of sarcopenia. The impact of sarcopenia on the operative outcomes was evaluated using both univariate and multivariate analysis. The mean patient age was 84 years, with an in-hospital mortality of 18%. Sarcopenia was present in 73% of patients. More sarcopenic patients had postoperative complications (45% sarcopenic versus 15% nonsarcopenic, P = .005) and more died in hospital (23 vs 4%, P = .037). There were no differences in duration of stay or requirement for intensive care unit postoperatively. After we controlled for confounding factors, increasing skeletal muscle index (per incremental cm(2)/m(2)) was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality (odds ratio ∼0.834, 95% confidence interval 0.731-0.952, P = .007) in multivariate analysis. Sarcopenia was independently predictive of greater complication rates, discharge disposition, and in-hospital mortality in the very elderly emergency surgery population. Using sarcopenia as an objective tool to identify high-risk patients would be beneficial in developing tailored preventative strategies and potentially resource allocation in the future."

    "title": "The impact of an acute care surgery clinical care pathway for suspected appendicitis on the use of CT in the emergency department.",
    "abstract": "The natural evolution of an acute care surgery (ACS) service is to develop disease-specific care pathways aimed at quality improvement. Our primary goal was to evaluate the implementation of an ACS pathway dedicated to suspected appendicitis on patient flow and the use of computed tomography (CT) in the emergency department (ED). All adults within a large health care system (3 hospitals) with suspected appendicitis were analyzed during our study period, which included 3 time periods: pre- and postimplementation of the disease-specific pathway and at 12-month follow-up. Of the 1168 consultations for appendicitis that took place during our study period, 349 occurred preimplementation, 392 occurred postimplementation, and 427 were follow-up visits. In all, 877 (75%) patients were admitted to the ACS service. Overall, 83% of patients underwent surgery within 6 hours. The mean wait time from CT request to obtaining the CT scan decreased with pathway implementation at all sites (197 v. 143 min, p < 0.001). This improvement was sustained at 12-month followup (131 min, p < 0.001). The pathway increased the number of CTs completed in under 2 hours from 3% to 42% (p < 0.001). No decrease in the total number of CTs or the pattern of ultrasonography was noted (p = 0.42). Wait times from ED triage to surgery were shortened (665 min preimplementation, 633 min postimplementation, 631 min at the 12-month follow-up, p = 0.040). A clinical care pathway dedicated to suspected appendicitis can decrease times to both CT scan and surgical intervention. LL’évolution naturelle d’un service de chirurgie d’urgence (SCU) consiste à mettre au point des plans d’intervention spécifiques aux maladies dans le but d’améliorer la qualité des soins. Notre objectif principal était d’évaluer l’impact de l’instauration au SCU d’un plan d’intervention spécifique à l’appendicite présumée sur le roulement des patients et sur l’utilisation de la tomodensitométrie (TDM) à l’urgence. Les dossiers de tous les patients adultes d’un important réseau de santé (3 hôpitaux) s’étant présentés pour une appendicite présumée ont été analysés durant la période de notre étude qui incluait 3 étapes : avant et après la mise en oeuvre du plan d’intervention spécifique, puis suivi à 12 mois. Sur les 1168 consultations pour appendicite qui ont eu lieu durant notre étude, 349 se sont déroulées avant la mise en oeuvre du service, 392, après sa mise en oeuvre, et 427 étaient des visites de suivi. En tout, 877 patients (75 %) ont été admis au SCU. Globalement, 83 % des patients ont subi une chirurgie dans les 6 heures. Le temps d’attente moyen entre la demande de TDM et sa réalisation a diminué après l’application du plan d’intervention pour tous les sites (197 c. 143 min, p < 0,001). Cette amélioration se maintenait toujours au suivi de 12 mois (131 min, p < 0,001). Le plan d’intervention a permis de faire passer le nombre de TDM réalisées en moins de 2 heures de 3 % à 42 % (p < 0,001). On n’a noté aucune diminution du nombre total de TDM ou des tendances de l’échographie (p = 0,42). Les temps d’attente entre le triage et l’appendicectomie ont diminué (665 min avant et 633 min après l’application du plan d’intervention, 631 min au suivi de 12 mois, p = 0.040). Un plan d’intervention spécifique à l’appendicite peut réduire les temps d’attente pour la TDM et l’intervention chirurgicale."

    "abstract": "Preventable readmission has become a national focus. It is clear that surgical patients present specific challenges to those interested in preventing readmission. Little is known about this outcome in the emergent population. We are interested in determining if there are readily available data variables to predict risk of readmission. The surgical Apgar score (SAS) is calculated from objective intraoperative variables and has been shown to be predictive of postoperative mortality in the nonemergent setting. The objectives of this study were to characterize 30-day readmissions in emergent general surgery and to determine whether certain variables were associated with readmissions. We hypothesized that the SAS correlates with the risk for readmission in emergency general surgery patients. Variables of interest were obtained from a retrospective analysis of the American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database at an academic institution, paired with the electronic medical record. We identified adult general surgery patients who underwent an emergency procedure from 2006 to 2012. Univariate analysis identified factors associated with 30-day readmission. Factors with p < 0.1 were included in the multivariate analysis to reveal potential risk factors. SPSS version 20 was used for the statistical analysis, with p < 0.05 considered to be significant on multivariate analysis. As compared with nonemergency surgery patients, emergency surgery patients had a higher readmission rate (11.1% vs. 15.2%, p = 0.004). The SAS (odds ratio, 3.297; 95% confidence interval, 1.074-10.121; p = 0.037) and the combined variable of the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification and length of stay (odds ratio, 4.370; 95% confidence interval, 2.251-8.486; p < 0.001) were associated with elevated risk for readmission in emergency general surgery patients. We have identified readily available measures that allow for the stratification of patients into low- and high-risk groups for 30-day readmission. The stratification of patients will enable the study of prospective interventions designed to decrease unplanned readmissions in emergency surgery patients. Prognostic study, level II."

    "abstract": "The use of an acute care surgical model has been shown to improve patient care and efficiency. We propose that it is possible to apply this model to emergency general surgery patients at a nontrauma hospital. With this acute care surgery service, no change in the quality of care will occur, and improvements in quality, cost, and outcomes may be achieved and sustained. A retrospective review was performed of all emergency surgery operations performed at a tertiary referral community hospital without a trauma service. Data were collected from 1 year before and each year up to 4 years after the implementation of an acute care surgical (ACS) service. There were fewer overall complications with ACS (21% to 12%, p < 0.0001), and a shorter length of stay (6.5 days to 5.7 days, p = 0.0016). Hospital costs fell from $12,009 to $8,306 (p < 0.0001). Post-appendectomy complications decreased (13% to 3.7%, p < 0.0001), length of stay was shorter (3.0 to 2.3 days, p < 0.0001), and hospital costs decreased from $9,392 to $5,872 (p < 0.0001). Post-cholecystectomy complications decreased (21% to 9%, p = 0.012), length of stay was shorter (5.3 to 3.8 days, p = 0.0004), and hospital costs decreased from $12,526 to $9,348 (p < 0.0001). An acute care surgery service can be successfully implemented at a nontrauma hospital. The improvements seen in outcomes and finances are sustainable over time. This sort of coordinated, consistent care is successful and allows alignment of the goals of surgeons, hospitals, and patients."

    "abstract": "Since acute care surgery (ACS) was conceptualized a decade ago, the specialty has been adopted widely; however, little is known about the structure and function of ACS teams. We conducted 18 open-ended interviews with ACS leaders (representing geographic [New England, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, South, West, Midwest] and practice [Public/Charity, Community, University] diversity). Two independent reviewers analyzed transcribed interviews using an inductive approach (NVivo qualitative analysis software). All respondents described ACS as a specialty treating \"time-sensitive surgical disease\" including trauma, emergency general surgery (EGS), and surgical critical care (SCC); 11 of 18 combined trauma and EGS into a single clinical team; 9 of 18 included elective general surgery. Emergency orthopedics, emergency neurosurgery, and surgical subspecialty triage were rare (1/18 each). Eight of 18 ACS teams had scheduled EGS operating room time. All had a core group of trauma and SCC surgeons; 13 of 18 shared EGS due to volume, human resources, or competition for revenue. Only 12 of 18 had formal signout rounds; only 2 of 18 had prospective EGS data registries. Streamlined access to EGS, evidence-based protocols, and improved education were considered strengths of ACS. ACS was described as the \"last great surgical service\" reinvigorated to provide \"timely,\" cost-effective EGS by experts in \"resuscitation and critical care\" and to attract \"young, talented, eager surgeons\" to trauma/SCC; however, there was concern that ACS might become the \"wastebasket for everything that happens at inconvenient times.\" Despite rapid adoption of ACS, its implementation varies widely. Standardization of scope of practice, continuity of care, and registry development may improve EGS outcomes and allow the specialty to thrive."

    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery is increasingly recognized as an area for improvement within the National Health Service in the United Kingdom. Our aim was to test the feasibility of a tool we developed in assessing and facilitating surgical decision making by trainees in the emergency setting. A decision-making tool based on common decisions in surgery was designed and incorporated prospectively into patient clerking. The 10 decisions available to surgeons were divided into 3 major headings: discharge decisions, observation decisions, and operative decisions. \"Ideal decisions\" were derived from the final diagnosis on discharge by 2 independent clinicians and compared with initial decisions made by surgeons. We analyzed the data with a view to validate the tool using 2 methods. Firstly, we looked at the percentage of correct decisions made by different grades of surgeon, and secondly, we analyzed the trends in deviations from ideal decisions. The decision-making tool was completed for 136 emergent surgical admissions over 2 months. Interns made less \"ideal\" decisions compared with residents (45% vs 56%, respectively; p = 0.10, Fisher exact test) and attending surgeons (45% vs 70%, respectively; p = 0.0001). Interns made more \"admit and observe or investigate\" decisions compared with residents (63% vs 55%, respectively; p = 0.27) and attending surgeons (63% vs 51%, respectively; p = 0.01), who were more likely to decide to operate on or discharge patients. A repeat study over the subsequent 2-month period has shown comparable findings in proportion of ideal decisions for each grade of surgeon. There are significant differences in the proportion of \"ideal decisions\" and types of decisions between interns and attending surgeons suggesting a learning curve and potential for using this tool in decision-making training. The tool inherently facilitates discussion over decisions made by making these explicit. Repeating the study revealed an internal consistency."

    "abstract": "Acute care surgical services provide timely comprehensive emergency general surgical care while optimizing the use of limited resources. At our institution, 50% of the daily dedicated operating room (OR) time allocated to the Acute Care Emergency Surgery Service (ACCESS) came from previous elective general surgery OR time. We assessed the impact of this change in resource allocation on wait-times for elective general surgery cancer cases. We retrospectively reviewed adult patients who underwent elective cancer surgeries in the pre-ACCESS (September 2009 to June 2010) and post-ACCESS (September 2010 to June 2011) eras. Wait-times, calculated as the time between booking and actual dates of surgery, were compared within assigned priority classifications. Categorical and continuous variables were compared using chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests respectively. A total of 732 cases (367 pre-ACCESS and 365 post-ACCESS) were identified, with no difference in median wait-times (25 versus 23 days) between the eras. However, significantly fewer cases exceeded wait-time targets in the post-ACCESS era (p <0.0001). There was a significant change (p = 0.027) in the composition of cancer cases, with fewer breast cancer operations (22% versus 28%), and more colorectal (41% versus 32%) and hepatobiliary cancer cases (5% versus 2%) in the post-ACCESS era. These results suggest that shifting OR resources towards emergency surgery does not affect the timeliness of surgical cancer care. This study may encourage more centres to adopt acute care surgical services alongside their elective or subspecialty practices."

We assessed the volume and distribution of emergency general surgery (EGS) procedures before and after the implementation of the Acute Care and Emergency Surgery Service (ACCESS) at a Canadian tertiary care hospital and its effect on surgeon billings. This single-centre retrospective case-control study compared adult patients who underwent EGS procedures between July and December 2009 (pre-ACCESS), to those who had surgery between July and December 2010 (post-ACCESS). Case distribution was compared between day (7 am to 3 pm), evening (3 pm to 11 pm) and night (11 pm to 7 am). Frequencies were compared using the χ(2) test. Pre-ACCESS, 366 EGS procedures were performed: 24% during the day, 55% in the evening and 21% at night. Post-ACCESS, 463 operations were performed: 55% during the day, 36% in the evening and 9% at night. Reductions in night-time and evening EGS were 57% and 36% respectively (p < 0.001). Total surgeon billings for operations pre- and post-ACCESS were $281 066 and $287 075, respectively: remuneration was $6008 higher post-ACCESS for an additional 97 cases (p = 0.003). Using cost-modelling analysis, post-ACCESS surgeon billing for appendectomies, segmental colectomies, laparotomies and cholecystectomies all declined by $67 190, $125 215, $66 362, and $84 913, respectively (p < 0.001). Acute care surgical services have dramatically shifted EGS from nighttime to daytime. Cost-modelling analysis demonstrates that these services have cost-savings potential for the health care system without reducing overall surgeon billing. La mise sur pied d’un service d’urgences chirurgicales permet d’offrir des soins de chirurgie générale d’urgence complets, tout en assurant une utilisation potentiellement plus efficiente des ressources en soins de santé. Nous avons évalué le volume et la distribution des interventions de chirurgie générale d’urgence (CGU) avant et après la mise sur pied d’un service de soins chirurgicaux d’urgence (SSCU) dans un hôpital de soins tertiaires canadien et mesuré son effet sur la facturation émise par les chirurgiens. Cette étude rétrospective cas–témoins réalisée dans un seul centre a comparé des patients adultes soumis à des interventions de CGU entre juillet et décembre 2009 (pré-SSCU) à ceux qui avaient subi une intervention chirurgicale entre juillet et décembre 2010 (post-SSCU). Nous avons comparé la distribution des cas entre les quarts de jour (de 7 heures à 15 heures), de soir (de 15 heures à 23 heures) et de nuit (de 23 heures à 7 heures). Nous avons utilisé le test χ2 pour comparer les fréquences. Pendant la période pré-SSCU, 366 interventions de CGU ont été effectuées : 24 % durant le jour, 55 % durant la soirée et 21 % durant la nuit. Après la mise en place du SSCU, 463 opérations ont été effectuées : 55 % durant le jour, 36 % durant la soirée et 9 % durant la nuit. Les réductions observées au plan des CGU réalisées durant la nuit et la soirée ont été de 57 % et 36 %, respectivement (p < 0,001). La facturation totale soumise par les chirurgiens pour les interventions réalisées avant et après la mise en place du SSCU a été respectivement de 281 066 $ et de 287 075 $ : la rémunération a été de 6008 $ supérieure après la mise en place du SSCU, pour 97 cas additionnels (p = 0,003). L’analyse de modélisation des coûts a révélé qu’après la mise en place du SSCU, la facturation soumise par les chirurgiens pour les appendicectomies, les colectomies segmentaires, les laparotomies et les cholécystectomies a diminué de 67 190 $, 125 215 $, 66 362 $ et 84 913 $, respectivement (p < 0,001). Les services de soins chirurgicaux d’urgence ont considérablement modifié les interventions de CGU, les faisant passer des quarts de travail de nuit à ceux du jour. L’analyse de modélisation des coûts démontre que le SSCU recèle un potentiel d’économies pour le système de soins de santé sans réduire la facturation totale émise par les chirurgiens."

However, it is unclear whether acute care surgery (ACS) services can expedite the workup and treatment of complex surgical diseases such as emergency CRC. We sought to assess the impact of an Acute Care and Emergency Surgery Service (ACCESS) on wait-times for inpatient colonoscopy and surgical resection among emergency CRC patients. This retrospective case-control study was conducted at a tertiary-care, university-affiliated, cancer centre in London, Ontario, Canada. All patients aged 18 or older who presented to the emergency department with a recent (within 48 hours) diagnosis of CRC, or were diagnosed with CRC after admission, were included in the study. Patients were either in the pre-ACCESS (July 1, 2007-June 31, 2010) or post-ACCESS (July 1, 2010-June 30, 2012) groups. A third group of emergency CRC patients treated at an adjacent cancer centre that lacked ACCESS (non-ACCESS) was evaluated separately. The primary outcome was time from admission to colonoscopy and surgery. A total of 149 patients (47 pre-ACCESS, 37 post-ACCESS, and 65 non-ACCESS) were identified. Only 19% (n = 9) of pre-ACCESS patients underwent inpatient colonoscopy, compared to 38% (n = 14) in the post-ACCESS group (p = 0.023). Additionally, 100% of patients in the post-ACCESS era underwent inpatient colonoscopy and surgery during the same admission, compared to only 44% of pre-ACCESS patients (p = 0.006). Median wait-times for inpatient colonoscopy (2.0 and 1.8 days for pre- and post-ACCESS groups respectively, p = 0.08) and surgical resection (1.6 and 2.3 days for pre- and post-ACCESS groups respectively, p = 0.40) were similar. Patients admitted to ACCESS underwent more inpatient colonoscopies and were more likely to have definitive surgery on that admission. ACS services can facilitate the workup and management of complex surgical diseases such as emergency CRC without delaying treatment."

A uniform grading system for measuring anatomic severity of disease in EGS is described, with specific grades for eight commonly encountered gastrointestinal conditions. These grades range from Grade I through Grade V, reflecting an escalating clinical progression from mild disease limited within the organ itself to severe disease that is widespread. This article provides a unified grading system for measuring anatomic severity of disease that is essential to advance the science of EGS.

We hypothesized that, in patients with gallbladder (GB) disease who were admitted through our emergency department (ED) and then underwent surgery, the ACS model shortened the time to surgery, decreased the length of hospital stay, and reduced hospital costs. We retrospectively queried our GB surgery practice records for 2008 (before the establishment of the ACS model at our institution in 2009). We then performed time and cost comparison with our prospectively maintained GB surgery practice database for 2010. We excluded any inpatient GB surgeries and any GB surgeries that were performed for choledocholithiasis and acute pancreatitis. Our study was composed of 94 patients from the pre-ACS period (2008) and 234 patients from the ACS period (2010). Patients' baseline characteristics were similar between the two periods, except for a higher percentage of females in the ACS period (77% vs. 66%, p = 0.04). Approximately one third of patients from both periods had acute cholecystitis. In the ACS period, the mean time to surgery, that is, from ED arrival to operating room arrival, was shorter (20.8 [13.8] hours vs. 25.7 [16.2] hours, p = 0.007); more patients underwent surgery within 24 hours after ED arrival (75% vs. 59%, p = 0.004); and more patients underwent surgery between 12:00 midnight and 7:00 AM (25% vs. 6.4%, p < 0.001). As a result, hospital length of stay was 1.4 days shorter in the ACS period, with cost saving per patient of approximately $1,000. We found that implementation of ACS model led to benefits for patients who came to our ED with GB disease, including shorter time to surgery, shorter hospital stay, and decreased hospital costs.

The ASU model was initially developed in New South Wales hospitals during 2005 and 2006. Several studies have analysed the effects on patient outcomes and timeliness of care for nontrauma patients presenting with acute general surgical conditions. The purpose of this study was to perform a meta-analysis to determine the efficacy of the ASU model compared with the traditional on-call model for specific conditions. A systematic search was conducted using MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Current Contents Connect, Cochrane library, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Web of Science. Original data were extracted from each study and used to calculate a pooled odd ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI). The search identified 18 studies; appendectomy (n = 9), acute cholecystitis (n = 7), and small-bowel obstruction (SBO) (n = 2). In the appendectomy cohort, the proportion of appendicular perforation were similar in pre-ASU and ASU period (OR 1.02, 95 % CI 0.77-1.37, p = 0.13). The incidence of complications in the appendectomy cohort was significantly lower in the ASU group; 14.5 % pre-ASU and 10.9 % post-ASU (OR 1.649, 95 % CI 0.732-3.714, p = 0.009). The negative appendectomy rate was similar for the pre- and post-ASU groups (OR 1.07, 95 % CI 0.88-1.31, p = 0.83). Likewise the conversion rate to open surgery and total hospital stay were similar between the two groups. The proportion of night time operations reduced significantly in the ASU period (OR 1.9, 95 % CI 1.32-2.74, p = 0.001). In the acute cholecystitis cohort, the conversion rate to open surgery was significantly higher in the pre-ASU group (15.1 %) compared with the post-ASU group (7.5 %) (OR 1.879, 95 % CI 1.072-3.293, p = 0.04) The incidence of complications was higher in the pre-ASU (14 %) compared with the post-ASU (6.8 %) group (OR 2.231, 95 % CI 1.372-3.236, p = 0.03). The mean hospital stay was significantly lower in the ASU period (5.3 vs. 3.7 days, p = 0.0063). There was insufficient data available to analyse outcomes for SBO. The ASU model provides a safe surgical environment for patients and is associated with a reduced complication rate for appendectomy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. There is a reduced conversion rate and a shorter length of stay for patients with acute cholecystitis. Overall, the ASU model has translated to better outcomes for patients presenting with acute general surgical conditions."

    "title": "Impact of an acute care surgery service on timeliness of care and surgeon satisfaction at a Canadian academic hospital: a retrospective study.",
    "abstract": "In January 2012 an acute care surgery (ACS) model was introduced at St. Paul's Hospital, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. The goal of implementing an ACS service was to improve the delivery of care for emergent, non-trauma surgical patients. We examined whether the ACS model improved wait time to surgery, decreased the proportion of surgeries performed after hours, and shortened post-surgical length of stay. We also assessed whether the surgeons working in an ACS system had higher on-call satisfaction than surgeons working in a non- ACS system. A retrospective pre-post analysis was performed using data from the Discharge Abstract Database and the Organizing Medical Networked Information database. Surgeon satisfaction was evaluated using a questionnaire that was mailed to all general surgeons in Saskatoon. An ACS service significantly reduced wait time to surgery for patients with all acute general surgery diagnoses from 221 minutes to 192 minutes (ρ = 0.015; CI = 5.8-52.2). Post-surgery length of stay for patients operated on for acute appendicitis, or acute cholecystitis was not reduced. On average, patients with bowel obstruction had increased length of stay following ACS service implementation. Most surgeries in our study were performed between 16:00 hours and 08:00 hours but the introduction of an ACS significantly reduced the number of afterhours surgeries (60.0% vs. 72.6%) (ρ < 0.0001). Our survey had a response rate of 75%. Overall, surgeons on an ACS service had greater satisfaction with the organization of their call schedule than surgeons not on an ACS service. Introduction of an ACS service in Saskatoon has decreased wait time to surgery and reduced the proportion of afterhours emergency surgeries, with no reduction in the length of post-surgery hospital stay. Satisfaction may be higher for surgeons in an ACS service."

    "title": "Abdominal damage control surgery and reconstruction: world society of emergency surgery position paper.",
    "abstract": "Damage control laparotomy was first described by Dr. Harlan Stone in 1983 when he suggested that patients with severe trauma should have their primary procedures abbreviated when coagulopathy was encountered. He recommended temporizing patients with abdominal packing and temporary closure to allow restoration of normal physiology prior to returning to the operating room for definitive repair. The term damage control in the trauma setting was coined by Rotondo et al., in 1993. Studies in subsequent years have validated this technique by demonstrating decreased mortality and immediate post-operative complications. The indications for damage control laparotomy have evolved to encompass abdominal compartment syndrome, abdominal sepsis, vascular and acute care surgery cases. The perioperative critical care provided to these patients, including sedation, paralysis, nutrition, and fluid management strategies may improve closure rates and recovery. In the rare cases of inability to primarily close the abdomen, there are a number of reconstructive strategies that may be used in the acute and chronic phases of abdominal closure."

    "abstract": "ICU needs of nontrauma emergency general surgery patients are poorly described. This study was designed to compare ICU utilization of emergency general surgery patients admitted to an acute care emergency surgery service with other general surgery patients. Our hypothesis is that tertiary care emergency general surgery patients utilize more ICU resources than other general surgical patients. Retrospective database review. Academic, tertiary care, nontrauma surgical ICU. All patients admitted to the surgical ICU over age 18 between March 2004 and June 2012. None. Six thousand ninety-eight patients were evaluated: 1,053 acute care emergency surgery, 1,964 general surgery, 1,491 transplant surgery, 995 facial surgery/otolaryngology, and 595 neurosurgery. Acute care emergency surgery patients had statistically significantly longer ICU lengths of stay than other groups: acute care emergency surgery (13.5 ± 17.4 d) versus general surgery (8.7 ± 12.9), transplant (7.8 ± 11.6), oral-maxillofacial surgery (5.5 ± 4.2), and neurosurgery (4.47 ± 9.8) (all p< 0.01). Ventilator usage, defined by percentage of total ICU days patients required mechanical ventilation, was significantly higher for acute care emergency surgery patients: acute care emergency surgery 73.4% versus general surgery 64.9%, transplant 63.3%, oral-maxillofacial surgery 58.4%, and neurosurgery 53.1% (all p < 0.01). Continuous renal replacement therapy usage, defined as percent of patients requiring this service, was significantly higher in acute care emergency surgery patients: acute care emergency surgery 10.8% versus general surgery 4.3%, transplant 6.6%, oral-maxillofacial surgery 0%, and neurosurgery 0.5% (all p < 0.01). Acute care emergency surgery patients were more likely interhospital transfers for tertiary care services than general surgery or transplant (24.5% vs 15.5% and 8.3% respectively, p < 0.001 for each) and more likely required emergent surgery (13.7% vs 6.7% and 3.5%, all p < 0.001). Chronic comorbidities were similar between acute care emergency surgery and general surgery, whereas transplant had fewer. Emergency general surgery patients have increased ICU needs in terms of length of stay, ventilator usage, and continuous renal replacement therapy usage compared with other services, perhaps due to the higher percentage of transfers and emergent surgery required. These patients represent a distinct population. Understanding their resource needs will allow for better deployment of hospital resources."

    "abstract": "Elderly patients who have preexisting DNR orders experience a high incidence of mortality and major morbidity within 30 days after emergency general surgery. Although not a risk factor for major morbidity, preoperative DNR status does represent an independent risk factor for mortality after emergency general surgery. The most plausible reason for the excess mortality in DNR patients is their decreased willingness to undergo aggressive treatment of major postoperative complications. Whether patient-driven failure-to-pursue-rescue also explains to some extent the high mortality of non-DNR elderly emergency general surgery patients deserves further investigation."

    "abstract": "Laparoscopic surgery (LS) has become standard practice for a range of elective general surgical operations. Its role in emergency general surgery is gaining momentum. This study aimed to assess the outcomes of LS compared with open surgery (OS) for colorectal resections in the emergency setting. A systematic review was performed of studies reporting outcomes of laparoscopic colorectal resections in the acute or emergency setting in patients aged over 18 years, between January 1966 and January 2013. Twenty-two studies were included, providing outcomes for 5557 patients: 932 laparoscopic and 4625 open emergency resections. Median (range) operating time was 184 (63-444) min for LS versus 148 (61-231) min for OS. Median (range) length of stay was 10 (3-23) and 15 (6-33) days in the LS and OS groups respectively. The overall median (range) complication rate was 27.8 (0-33.3) and 48.3 (9-72) per cent respectively. There were insufficient data to detect differences in reoperation and readmission rates. Emergency laparoscopic colorectal resection, where technically feasible, has better short-term outcomes than open resection."

    "abstract": "Patient benefits from natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) are of interest in acute-care surgery. This review provides an overview of the historical development of NOTES procedures, and addresses their current uses and limitations for intra-abdominal emergency conditions. A PubMed search was carried out for articles describing NOTES approaches for appendicectomy, percutaneous gastrostomy, hollow viscus perforation and pancreatic necrosectomy. Pertinent articles were reviewed and data on available outcomes synthesized. Emergency conditions in surgery tax the patient's cardiovascular and respiratory systems, and fluid and electrolyte balance. The operative intervention itself leads to an inflammatory response and blood loss, thus adding to the physiological stress. NOTES provides a minimally invasive alternative access to the peritoneal cavity, avoiding abdominal wall incisions. A clear advantage to the patient is evident with the implementation of an endoscopic approach to deal with inadvertently displaced percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes and perforated gastroduodenal ulcer. The NOTES approach appears less invasive for patients with infected pancreatic necrosis, in whom it allows surgical debridement and avoidance of open necrosectomy. Transvaginal appendicectomy is the second most frequently performed NOTES procedure after cholecystectomy. The NOTES concept has provided a change in perspective for intramural and transmural endoscopic approaches to iatrogenic perforations during endoscopy. NOTES approaches have been implemented in clinical practice over the past decade. Selected techniques offer reduced invasiveness for patients with intra-abdominal emergencies, and may improve outcomes. Steady future development and adoption of NOTES are likely to follow as technology improves and surgeons become comfortable with the approaches."

    "abstract": "Appendicectomy is a common general surgical emergency procedure and may be used as a surrogate marker to evaluate quality in surgical management. The aim of this study was to assess the outcomes of appendicectomy before and after the introduction of a consultant-led emergency general surgery (EGS) service at a large metropolitan tertiary referral centre. A retrospective historical control study was performed that included all adult patients undergoing appendicectomy during two 18-month periods, before and after the introduction of the EGS service. Data collected included patient demographics, use of radiological investigations, time to surgery, length of hospital stay and histopathology findings. Outcome measures were time to surgery, hospital length of stay, use of radiological investigations, negative appendicectomy rate and perforation rate. A total of 675 patients were identified of whom 276 had an appendicectomy before the EGS service was introduced (2008-2009) and 399 after its introduction (2011-2012). The EGS service resulted in an increase in time to surgery (15 versus 18 h; P < 0.001) with no increase in length of hospital stay (3 days for both periods; P = 0.424). An increase in the rate of appendicectomies performed within office hours was seen (54.3 versus 64.4 per cent; P < 0.001), with no significant increase in negative appendicectomy (13.0 versus 15.8 per cent; P = 0.322) or perforation (8.3 versus 5.5 per cent; P = 0.149) rates. The use of preoperative computed tomography reduced from 38.4 to 26.6 per cent (P = 0.001). The introduction of a consultant-led EGS service resulted in a decrease in the use of computed tomography and a greater proportion of appendicectomies performed within office hours, with no increase in length of stay. Overall negative appendicectomy and perforation rates did not change."

    "abstract": "Surgical services in Australia are under sustained and growing pressure. The global implementation of acute care surgery services has been shown to facilitate the timeliness of acute surgery. The question is: Do acute care surgical units fit major regional centers like ours? The current study coincides with the introduction of a Surgical Assessment and Planning Unit (SAPU) at the Canberra Hospital and compares patient outcomes before vs. after the introduction of the SAPU, using acute appendicitis as the model illness. We reviewed patients presenting to the Canberra Hospital Emergency Department with a preliminary diagnosis of acute appendicitis before vs. after the introduction of an acute care surgical unit. The subjects were 150 patients, ranging in age from 16 to 97 years. The mean time from presentation at casualty to surgical review and the surgical review itself was reduced by 19 and 26 %, respectively (p < 0.05). Time to the operating table and the percentage of after-hours operations were reduced by 8 and 40 %, respectively. There was a significant reduction in the utilization of abdominal ultrasonography after the implementation of the SAPU. The implementation of a SAPU has benefited the management of patients with acute surgical conditions. Ultimately, patient care is enhanced, with patients being reviewed, admitted, and treated earlier."

    "abstract": "On April 15, 2013, at approximately 2:49 p.m. EDT, two improvised explosive devices detonated near the finish line of the 117th Boston Marathon. Patients were transported from the scene to several trauma centers, including the authors' institution. Plastic surgical assessment of patients began in the Emergency Department and then rapidly expanded as the scope of the incident became clear. Daily interdisciplinary meetings involving the acute care surgery, orthopedic surgery, plastic surgery, and nursing services were convened in order to coordinate operating room schedules and treatment plans. An interdisciplinary weekly clinic continued until all patient goals had been reached. Twenty-four patients were treated at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center within the first 24 hours of the Boston Marathon bombing. Seven were triaged directly to the operating room from the Emergency Department. The Division of Plastic Surgery was directly involved with the care of 11 patients, all of whom were treated surgically within 24 hours of the bombing. Patients were aged 23 to 50 years old. All 11 patients sustained lower extremity injuries with gross contamination. Four patients also sustained significant upper extremity trauma. Injuries included extremity amputations and fractures, soft-tissue loss, impaction of nails and other debris, burns, ocular injury, and ruptured tympanic membranes. Twenty-four patients received acute care at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center following the Boston Marathon bombing. Institution of dedicated interdisciplinary daily rounds, protected operating room block time, and joint follow-up clinic allowed for efficient early diagnosis and treatment of patients' injuries."

    "abstract": "Monash Medical Centre introduced the acute surgical unit (ASU) in July 2011. The ASU is modelled on the concept of acute care surgery (ACS). This study reviews the impact of the ASU on the outcomes in an appendicectomy population. A retrospective review of all patients (aged 16-99 years) who underwent appendicectomies in the 2-year study time frame (from July 2010 to June 2012) at our centre was performed. The cohort (n = 539) was divided into two groups for analysis: the ASU group, patients admitted on or after 18 July 2011 (n = 283), and the control group, patients admitted prior to 18 July 2011 (n = 256). Median time to operation (1129 min versus 1080 min, P = 0.963) and negative appendicectomy rate (24.2% versus 24.8%, P = 0.871) were similar in both groups. The proportion of operations performed overnight (18.00-08.00 hours) was significantly decreased in the ASU group (17.1% versus 30.7%, P < 0.001). Perforation rate was marginally higher in the ASU group (17.8% versus 11.8%, P = 0.053) but failed to reach statistical significance. There was an increase in the usage of preoperative imaging (40.3% versus 30.5%, P = 0.018) in the ASU group. Operating times, length of stay, laparoscopic-to-open conversion and surgical site infection rates remained similar. We conclude that implementation of an ACS model does not lead to objective differences in outcome for patients after appendicectomy. However, the ACS model significantly decreased the number of operations performed after-hours."

    "abstract": "Acute care surgery (ACS) remains in its infancy as a defined surgical specialty within hospital systems. Little has been published regarding the financial impact of this method of care delivery to hospital systems and departments when combining trauma, surgical critical care, emergent, and elective general surgery into a single practice model. We sought to compare hospital net income and divisional clinical productivity measures of a newly formed, university division of ACS based on patient type-trauma, emergency general surgery, and elective surgery-to determine the best avenues by which to focus on programmatic growth. Single calendar year, retrospective review of hospital system income and divisional fiscal productivity of specific patient visits by patient type (trauma, emergent, or elective) admitted to or discharged by the acute care surgeons. Demographic data, payor mix, patient volumes, and operative rates were determined for each patient type. Fiscal contribution by patient type to both hospital and clinical productivity were measured by hospital net income and divisional work relative value units (wRVU) production respectively. The Chi-square test for independence compared payor mix and analysis of variance was used for comparison of fiscal performance between patient types. We included 1,492 patients in the analysis of calendar year 2010; 1,056 trauma (67% male; mean age, 41.9; range, 0-102), 346 emergent (53% male; mean age, 44.6; range, 15-91), and 90 elective (51% male; mean age, 46; range, 16-87) patient encounters met criteria for analysis. There were no differences in payor mix between patient types. Significant differences were seen in average per patient encounter hospital net income, divisional wRVU production and duration of stay. The ACS team (n = 3) operated on 12% of trauma patients compared with 52% of emergent and 100% of elective surgery encounters. Hospital net income per patient was greatest for trauma encounters, whereas divisional clinical productivity per patient encounter was greatest for emergent patients. Elective encounters contributed negatively to hospital margins. Per-patient hospital system income and a majority of clinical wRVU productivity remains greatest for the care of injured patients in our ACS practice model; emergent general surgical encounters demonstrate the greatest per-patient rates of divisional clinical productivity."

    "abstract": "The consolidation of acute care surgery (ACS) services at 3 of 6 hospitals in a Canadian health region sought to alleviate a relative shortage of surgeons able to take emergency call. We examined how this affected patient access and outcomes. Using the generalized linear model and statistical process control, we analyzed ACS-related episodes that occurred between 39 months prior to and 17 months after the model's implementation (n = 14,713). Time to surgery increased after the consolidation. Wait times increased primarily for patients presenting at nonreferral hospitals who were likely to require transfer to a referral hospital. Although ACS teams enabled referral hospitals to handle a much higher volume of patients without increasing within-hospital wait times, overall system wait times were lengthened by the growing frequency of patient transfers. Wait times for inpatient admission were difficult to interpret because there was a trend toward admitting patients directly to the ACS service, bypassing the emergency department (ED). For patients who did go through the ED, wait times for inpatient admission increased after the consolidation; however, this trend was cancelled out by the apparently zero waits of patients who bypassed the ED. Regionalization showed no impact on length of stay, readmissions, mortality or complications. Consolidation enabled the region to ensure adequate surgical coverage without harming patients. The need to transfer patients who presented at nonreferral hospitals led to longer waits. Le regroupement des services chirurgicaux d'urgence (SCU) dans 3 hôpitaux sur 6 d'une région sanitaire canadienne visait à contrer une relative pénurie de chirurgiens capables d'effectuer les interventions d'urgence. Nous en avons analysé l'impact sur l'accessibilité des services et sur les résultats chez les patients. À l'aide du modèle linéaire généralisé et d'un contrôle statistique des procédés, nous avons analysé les cas adressés aux SCU entre 39 mois précédant et 17 mois suivant l'entrée en vigueur du regroupement des services (n = 14 713). L'intervalle avant l'intervention chirurgicale s'est allongé après le regroupement des services. Les temps d'attente ont principalement augmenté pour les patients qui consultaient dans un hôpital de premier recours d'où ils étaient susceptibles d'être réorientés vers un hôpital de référence. Même si les équipes des SCU ont permis aux hôpitaux de référence de gérer un volume beaucoup plus important de patients sans augmentation du temps d'attente à l'hôpital même, le temps d'attente dans son ensemble s'est prolongé à l'échelle du système en raison de l'accroissement du nombre de transferts. Les temps d'attente pour les hospitalisations ont été difficiles à interpréter parce qu'on avait tendance à admettre les patients directement aux SCU, en contournant les services d'urgences. Pour les patients qui passaient par les urgences, les temps d'attente pour une hospitalisation ont augmenté après le regroupement; toutefois, cette tendance a été compensée par l'attente pour ainsi dire nulle des patients qui contournaient les services d'urgence. La régionalisation n'a exercé aucun impact sur la durée du séjour, les réadmissions, la mortalité ou les complications. Le regroupement a permis à la région d'assurer une couverture chirurgicale adéquate sans nuire aux patients. La nécessité de réorienter des patients vers les hôpitaux de référence a contribué à prolonger les temps d'attente."

    "abstract": "The principle of damage-control laparotomy (DCL) in trauma is well established. The DCL concept can be applied in emergency general surgery when an abbreviated laparotomy is performed at the initial stage. Subsequent definitive management and abdominal closure are achieved when the patient is stabilized. In this study, we report our experience with DCL in acute general surgical nontrauma patients. A retrospective review was performed of all nontrauma patients who underwent DCL at Auckland City Hospital from January 2008 to December 2010. Data including indications and outcome were collected and analyzed. Forty-two nontrauma patients underwent DCL in the 3-year period. The median age was 66 years. There were 22 males and 20 females. The most common primary indications for DCL were bowel ischemia (13 patients), bleeding (13 patients), and peritonitis (10 patients). Majority of patients had an American Society of Anesthesiologists score of 3 or 4. Overall, 24 patients (57%) underwent closure of the fascia within 7 days, 7 patients were closed after more than 7 days, and 11 patients could not undergo primary closure at all. The main complications after DCL were sepsis (14 patients) and intra-abdominal collections (10 patients). There were significantly fewer postoperative complications in patients undergoing early closure. The medium length of stay in intensive care as well as in hospital was significantly less in the early closure group. However, postoperative respiratory failure was more common in those with early closure (5 vs. 0). The mortality rate overall was 19%, with no significant difference regarding timing of abdominal closure. The DCL principle is often applied to the critically ill surgical patients in the nontrauma setting. This group of critical surgical patients has a high morbidity and mortality. However, early abdominal closure should be performed where possible to prevent complications. It is unclear whether patients with early closure were going to have a better outcome regardless, and prospective studies are needed to address. Therapeutic/care management, level V."

The purpose of this new specialty is to involve trauma and nontrauma surgeons in the care of acutely ill patients with a surgical pathology. In Quebec, few acute care surgery services (ACSS) exist, and the concept is still poorly understood by most general surgeons. This survey was meant to determine the opinions and interest of Quebec general surgeons in this new model. We created a bilingual electronic survey using a Web interface and sent it by email to all surgeons registered with the Association québécoise de chirurgie. A reminder was sent 2 weeks later to boost response rates. The response rate was 36.9%. Most respondents had academic practices, and 16% worked in level 1 trauma centres. Most respondents had a high operative case load, and 66% performed at least 10 urgent general surgical cases per month. Although most (88%) thought that ACS was an interesting field, only 45% were interested in participating in an ACSS. Respondents who deemed this concept least applicable to their practices were more likely to be working in nonacademic centres. Despite a strong interest in emergency general surgery, few surgeons were interested in participating in an ACSS. This finding may be explained by lack of comprehension of this new model and by comfort with traditional practice. We aim to change this paradigm by demonstrating the feasibility and benefits of the new ACSS at our centre in a follow-up study.

Malgré un intérêt marqué à l'endroit des soins intensifs chirurgicaux, peu de chirurgiens ont semblé souhaiter participer à un service de ce type. Ce fait peut s'expliquer par la méconnaissance de ce nouveau modèle et par la force de l'habitude associée à la pratique traditionnelle.

The aim of this study was to quantify and explore variability in mortality amongst high-risk emergency general surgery admissions to English NHS hospital Trusts. The Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database was used to identify high-risk emergency general surgery diagnoses (greater than 5 per cent national 30-day mortality rate). Adults admitted to English NHS Trusts with these diagnoses between 2000 and 2009 were included in the study. Thirty-day in-hospital mortality was adjusted for patient and hospital factors. Trusts were grouped into high- and low-mortality outliers, and resource availability was compared between high- and low-mortality outlier institutions. Some 367 796 patients admitted to 145 hospital Trusts were included in the study; the 30-day mortality rate was 15·6 per cent (institutional range 9·2-18·2 per cent). Fourteen and 24 hospital Trusts were identified as high- and low-mortality outlier institutions respectively. Intensive care and high-dependency bed resources, as well as greater institutional use of computed tomography (CT), were independent predictors of reduced mortality (P < 0·001). Low-mortality outlying Trusts had significantly more intensive care beds per 1000 hospital beds (20·8 versus 14·0; P = 0·017) and made significantly greater use of CT (24·6 versus 17·2 scans per bed per year; P < 0·001) and ultrasonography (42·5 versus 30·2 scans per bed per year; P < 0·001). There is significant variability in mortality risk between hospital Trusts treating high-risk emergency general surgery patients.

    "abstract": "While advanced age is often associated with poorer surgical outcomes, long-term age-related health status following acute care surgery is unknown. The objective of our study was to assess post-operative cognitive impairment, functional status, and quality of life in elderly patients who underwent emergency surgery. We identified 159 octo- and nonagenarians who underwent emergency surgery between 2008 and 2010 at a single tertiary hospital. Patients were grouped into three cohorts: 1, 2, and 3 years post-operative. We conducted a survey in 2011, with octo- and nonagenarians regarding the impact of emergency surgical procedures. Consenting participants responded to four survey questionnaires: (1) Abbreviated Mental Test Score-4, (2) Barthel Index, (3) Vulnerable Elders Survey, and (4) EuroQol-5 Dimensional Scale. Of the 159 octo- and nonagenarians, 88 (55.3%) patients were alive at the time of survey conduction, and 55 (62.5%) of the surviving patients consented to participate. At 1, 2, and 3 years post-surgery, mortality rates were 38.5%, 44.7%, and 50.0%, respectively. More patients had cognitive impairments at 3 years (33.3%) than at 1 (9.5%) and 2 years (9.1%) post-operatively. No statistical difference in the ability to carry out activities of daily living or functional decline with increasing time post-operatively. However, patients perceived a significant health decline with the greater time that passed following surgery. Our study showed that half of the patients over the age of 80 are surviving up to 3 years post-operatively. While post-operative functional status appears to be stable across the 3 cohorts of patients, perceived health status declines over time. Understanding the long-term post-operative impact on cognitive impairment, functional status, and quality of life in elderly patients who undergo acute care surgery allows health care professionals to predict their patients' likely post-operative needs."

    "abstract": "A quiet revolution in American surgery has occurred over the past 10-15 years, with the emergence of acute care surgery as a true specialty, and apparently the heir to general surgery. This new paradigm traces its beginning to certain core safety net hospitals in the U.S., such as Denver Health Medical Center, San Fancisco General Hospital, Detroit Receiving Hospital, and Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, and has now extended its foothold to most U.S. academic institutions as well. The discipline of acute care surgery represents a fusion of trauma surgery, surgical critical care, and emergency surgery. although the actual surgical responsibilities of the ACS surgeon may vary, depending on local institutional needs, the core principles remain the same. The new specialty appears to have broad appeal not only to the departments in which they serve, but to resident trainees and hospital administration as well. While a number of challenges need to be addressed before adaption of this system to Israel, the new paradigm appears to have potential for serving Israeli surgery in the future. In summary, there is much to a name. Just as the guardian angel of Aisov gave the new name \"Israel\" to the biblical patriarch Jacob to signify that he had been evaluated to a new level--\"a prince in the eye of G-d and man\", \"Acute Care Surgery\" appears poised to transform General Surgery to a new level for the next generation of surgeons."

    "abstract": "Clinical research will increasingly play a core role in the evolution and growth of acute care surgery program development across the country. What constitutes an efficient and effective clinical research infrastructure in the current fiscal and academic environment remains obscure. We sought to characterize the effects of implementation of a multidisciplinary acute care research organization (MACRO) at a busy tertiary referral university setting. In 2008, to minimize redundancy and cost as well as to maximize existing resources promoting acute care research, MACRO was created, unifying clinical research infrastructure among the Departments of Critical Care Medicine, Emergency Medicine, and Surgery. During the periods 2008 to 2012, we performed a retrospective analysis and determined volume of clinical studies, patient enrollment for both observational and interventional trials, and staff growth since MACRO's origination and characterized changes over time. From 2008 to 2011, the volume of patients enrolled in clinical studies, which MACRO facilitates has significantly increased more than 300%. The percentage of interventional/observational trials has remained stable during the same period (50-60%). Staff has increased from 6 coordinators to 10, with an additional 15 research associates allowing 24/7 service. With this significant growth, MACRO has become financially self-sufficient, and additional outside departments now seek MACRO's services. Appropriate organization of acute care clinical research infrastructure minimizes redundancy and can promote sustainable, efficient growth in the current academic environment. Further studies are required to determine if similar models can be successful at other acute care surgery programs."

    "abstract": "Neurosurgical services are a limited resource and effective use of them would improve the health care system. Acute care surgeons (ACS) are accustomed to treating mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) including those with minor radiographic intracranial injuries. We hypothesized that ACS safely manage mild TBI with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on head computed tomographic (CT) scan without neurosurgical consultation (NC). We performed a retrospective analysis on all TBI patients with positive findings on head CT scan managed without NC during a 2-year period. Propensity scoring matched NC to no-NC patients on a 1:2 ratio for Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, head Abbreviated Injury Scale (h-AIS) score, neurological examination, age, Injury Severity Score (ISS), findings of initial head CT scan including type and size of ICH. A total of 270 patients with mild TBI and positive CT scan findings were included (90 with NC and 180 without NC). Sixty-three percent were male, and mean (SD) age was 39 (25) years. The median GCS was 15 (13-15), and the h-AIS score was 2 (1-3). In both groups, there was no neurosurgical intervention, in-hospital mortality, or 30-day readmission. In the no-NC group, 8% of the patients had postdischarge emergency department (ED) visits compared with 4% of the NC group (p = 0.5). All patients with postdischarge ED visits in both groups were discharged home from the ED. ACS can manage mild TBI with ICH without obtaining an inpatient NC. Further guidelines should be established to help identify which patients meet criteria to be safely managed without NC. Care management/therapeutic study, level IV."

    "abstract": "Although many acute care surgery (ACS) formats exist, the model established in 2006 at our academic, level 1 trauma center includes a dedicated daytime operating room. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effect that an ACS model with a dedicated daytime operating suite would have on outcomes and timeliness of care in patients with biliary tract disease. A retrospective cohort study was performed on all patients with biliary tract disease admitted to the University of Alberta Hospital pre- and post-ACS. Data collected included demographic information, medical diagnoses, procedures performed, and complications. Time points included the time from admission to operation, operative time, and length of hospital stay. Pre- and post-ACS groups were compared with the Pearson Chi square test and Student's t test (α = 0.05). There were 72 patients pre-ACS and 172 post-ACS. The two groups had similar demographics and co-morbidities. The post-ACS group had a shorter time from admission to operation (34.1 vs 24.8 h; p < 0.05). There was a decrease in the number of patients awaiting daytime operating room availability (95.8 vs 60.7 %; p < 0.05), with most surgeries being done within a 24 h period versus patients waiting upwards of 3 days pre-ACS. We observed a significant decrease in preoperative time by 10 h with increased access to a readily available operating room. Having a dedicated ACS team is important, but it is equally important to have a dedicated operating room with disposable time to care for unpredictable, emergent cases to realize the full potential benefit of the ACS model."

This white paper addresses the historical issues behind the present situation, the need for all intensivists to engage in dedicated critical care per the intensivist model, and the recognition that intensivists from all specialties can provide optimal care for the critically ill surgical patient, particularly with continuing involvement by the surgeon of record. The new acute care surgery training paradigm (including trauma, surgical critical care, and emergency general surgery) has been developed to increase interest in trauma and surgical critical care, but the number of interested trainees remains too few. Recommendations are made for broadening the multidisciplinary training and practice opportunities in surgical critical care for intensivists from all base specialties and for maintaining the intensivist model within acute care surgery practice. Support from academic and administrative leadership, as well as national organizations, will be needed."

    "abstract": "To assess the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention based on industrial process improvement to identify and sustainably correct deficiencies in thromboprophylaxis delivery. Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are major causes of morbidity and mortality in surgical patients, but effective prophylactic treatments are available. Ensuring reliable delivery of the intended thromboprophylaxis is, however, a long-standing problem. Delivery of thromboprophylactic treatment on an emergency general surgery admissions ward was targeted during a multidisciplinary intervention to improve process reliability using industrial quality improvement approaches. Delivery was audited against guidelines before and after 3- month intervention. Clinical outcome was evaluated by reviewing all radiological investigations for suspected Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) or Pulmonary Embolism (PE) from patients admitted to the unit in the 1 year immediately before and that immediately after intervention. Delivery of thromboprophylaxis according to guidelines was improved from 35% before to 87% 3 months after intervention (χ(2)=87.412, p<0.0001) and sustained at 86% 10 months after intervention. Radiologically identified thromboembolic events occurring up to 60 days after admission in patients admitted for over 48 h fell from 23/3075 (0.75%) before to 9/3080 (0.29%) after intervention (HR 0.39, CI 0.29 to 0.53, χ(2)=6.18, p=0.01292). The risk of thromboembolism in the two groups diverged during follow-up to 60 days, before converging again. A quality improvement process resulted in major sustainable improvements in the delivery of thromboprophylaxis associated with a 61% reduction in radiologically detected clinical episodes of thromboembolism 2 months after admission. Further study of this approach to improving care quality is warranted."

An Acute Surgical Model (ASM) was introduced at Geelong Hospital (GH) in 2011 involving a dedicated emergency general surgery theatre list every business day giving greater access to theatre for general surgeons. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the ASM at GH on the management of appendicitis, in particular the NA and PA rates. Data for 357 patients undergoing emergency appendicectomy was collected prospectively over 1 year (2011) and compared with a historical control group of 351 patients (2010). The data was analysed for patient demographics, preoperative diagnostic radiology and outcomes including NA and PA rates and complications. The negative appendicectomy rates were compared with contemporary studies. There was no difference between the two groups in rates of negative appendicectomy 21% (ASM; 73/357) versus 21% (Control; 73/351) P = 0.98, or perforated appendicitis 17% (ASM; 61/357) versus 13% (Control; 47/351) P = 0.18. The introduction of the ASM corresponded to a significantly lower proportion of emergency appendicectomies overnight (4% [16/357] versus 12% [44/351] P = 0.005). There was no significant difference in the use of preoperative diagnostic radiology or complications. Matched contemporary studies had a NA rate of 26%. The introduction of the ASM at GH has not significantly altered the rate of NA or PA. The NA rate at GH is comparable to other published UK and Australian series."

Although literature exists regarding the optimal timing of various surgical interventions, implementation of protocols for triage of surgical emergencies is lacking. For institutions of a repetitive triage mechanism, further discussion on optimal timing of surgery in diverse surgical emergencies should be encouraged.

We sought to identify contributing factors by analyzing endemic data during the development of an acute care surgery (ACS) service at an academic health care system. Financial data (receipts, payer mix, and dollar/relative value unit [RVU]) and productivity measures (OR procedures and RVUs) were obtained for a surgical division for 6-month periods before and after transition to an ACS model. Using national data, a sensitivity analysis was performed to identify salary targets required for an ACS surgeon to have equitable career reimbursement using standard financial modeling (net present value) with comparable surgical specialists. Post-ACS, operative volume increased 25%, work RVUs increased 21%, but net receipts increased only 11%. Dollar/RVU decreased primarily due to a higher proportion of uncompensated care. As a result, the dollar/RVU for ACS patients was 28% lower in comparison to non-ACS specialties. Increasing ACS salaries proportionate to the observed dollar/RVU discount realigned ACS economic value with other specialties in aggregate. A national shortage of ACS surgeons exists due to in part financial misalignment. We demonstrated that despite an increase in clinical activity, transition to an ACS model resulted in a relative reduction in payment. A rational systems-based approach to ACS development that objectively targets the RVU reimbursement disparity would reduce economic disincentives related to careers in ACS and potentially address the emergency surgical care crisis."

    "abstract": "Recent studies have identified unique clinical and physiologic characteristics of emergency general surgery (EGS) patients and called for outcomes data in this population. There are no data in the US literature analyzing the impact of technique on anastomotic failure rates in EGS patients. The purpose of the current study was to compare outcomes of hand-sewn (HS) versus stapled (ST) bowel anastomoses in EGS patients. A retrospective chart review of all patients admitted by our EGS service undergoing bowel resection for emergent indications from January 2007 to July 2011 was performed. Time from surgery to diagnosis of anastomotic failure was recorded as were the diagnostic modality and treatment of each anastomotic failure. Specific data on damage-control techniques, if used, were also collected. There were 100 HS (43%), and 133 ST (57%) anastomoses in 231 patients. Operative times were shorter in ST anastomosis technique (205 minutes for HS vs. 193 minutes for ST, p = 0.02). Anastomotic failures were identified in 26 patients (11%) and were significantly higher in the ST group than the HS group (15.0% vs. 6.1%, p = 0.003). A multivariate logistic regression analysis, controlling for age and preoperative nutritional status, revealed ST technique to be an independent risk factor for anastomotic failure (odds ratio, 2.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-6.50; p = 0.034). Anastomotic failures are more than twice as likely with ST than HS anastomoses in the EGS population. This is true even when controlling for markers of preoperative nutrition and demographics. These data suggest that the HS anastomosis should be the preferred method of reconstruction after bowel resection in EGS patients."

A modified Delphi methodology was used by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Committee on Severity Assessment and Patient Outcomes to review these codes and achieve consensus on the definition of primary EGS diagnosis codes. National Inpatient Sample data from 2009 were used to develop a national estimate of EGS burden of disease. Several unique ICD-9 codes were identified as primary EGS diagnoses. These encompass a wide spectrum of general surgery practice, including upper and lower gastrointestinal tract, hepatobiliary and pancreatic disease, soft tissue infections, and hernias. National Inpatient Sample estimates revealed over 4 million inpatient encounters nationally in 2009 for EGS diseases. This article provides the first list of ICD-9 diagnoses codes that define the scope of EGS based on current clinical practices. These findings have wide implications for EGS workforce training, access to care, and research."

Operative and ICU databases were queried for all operative procedures as a function of procedure type (CPT code) and location (OR, ICU) from August 2002 through June 2009. Mode of ventilation, type of anesthesia used, and adverse outcomes were recorded. Data were divided into 2002-2006 versus 2007-2009 because of MD staffing and service structure changes. Time frames were compared via Student's t-test or χ(2) as appropriate; significance for p < 0.05 (*) versus 2002-2006. Trauma service-admitted patient volume increased from 2002-2003 (n = 1,293) to 2006-2007 (n = 1,577) and again in 2008-2009 (n = 1,825). Emergency general surgery total operative cases increased from 2002-2003 (n = 246) to 2005-2006 (n = 468). Case volume further increased in 2006-2007 (n = 767*), 2007-2008 (n = 1,071*), and 2008-2009 (n = 875*) compared with 2002-2003 or 2005-2006.

This study examined the opinions of current general surgical residents about training and careers in this new field. A 36-item online anonymous survey regarding ACS was sent to the program directors of 55 randomly selected general surgery (GS) training programs for distribution to their categorical residents. The national sample consisted of 1,515 PGY 1 to 5 trainees. Response rate was 45%. More than 90% of residents had an appropriate understanding of the components of ACS as generally described (trauma, surgical critical care, and emergency GS). Nearly half (46%) of all respondents have considered ACS as a career. Overall, ACS ranked as the second most appealing career ahead of surgical critical care and trauma but behind GS. Most residents believed that ACS offers better or equivalent case complexity (88%), scope of practice (84%), case volume (75%), and level of reimbursement (69%) compared with GS alone. Respondents who answered ACS had a better scope of practice (61% vs. 36%), lifestyle as an attending surgeon (77% vs. 34%), or level of reimbursement (83% vs. 38%) compared with GS were twice as likely (p < 0.0001) to have considered ACS as a career. Overall, 40% of the residents believed that ACS offers a worse lifestyle in comparison with GS. These results suggest that there is notable interest in the emerging specialty of ACS. The level of resident interest in ACS as a fellowship and career may be increased by marketing those aspects of practice, which are viewed positively and addressing negative perceptions related to lifestyle. It may be appealing to add an elective GS component to certain ACS practice options."

Our hospital-acquired infection prevention committee approved the use of early nonbronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (screening-BAL) in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) to identify ventilated patients with bronchiolar bacteria before 48 hours. We reviewed the results of this quality improvement initiative. All ventilated patients in the SICU (March 2011 to June 2012) underwent a screening-BAL 36 hours to 48 hours after intubation; quantitative culture results (>5 × 10(4) colony-forming unit per milliliter) were used to identify positive specimens. Clinical pneumonia was defined as clinical pulmonary infection score greater than 6 with a subsequent positive diagnostic-BAL result. Sequential organ failure assessment scores were averaged for the first 48 hours in the SICU. Continuous and dichotomous data were compared, and a multivariate regression analysis was performed on the screening-BAL and pneumonia results. Screening-BALs were performed in 150 patients (99 trauma and 51 emergency general surgery patients), 72 of these specimens had positive findings. Fifty-three clinical pneumonias were diagnosed, and 45 (positive predictive value, 0.85) identified the same organism as the screening-BAL. Clinical pneumonia developed in eight patients with a negative screening-BAL (negative predictive value, 0.85). Antibiotic therapy at the time of the screening-BAL was associated with a negative screen (odds ratio, 0.44; p = 0.026). Pneumonia developed on median postintubation Day 4 (2-15 days) in patients with a positive screening-BAL results as compared with day 7.5 in the patients with a negative screening-BAL results (3.5-15 days; p = 0.007). Field intubation is an independent risk factor (odds ratio, 3.5; p = 0.004). Positive screening-BAL results in trauma and emergency general surgery patients are associated with the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia by the same organism and may play a role in identifying patients at risk for pneumonia. Further studies must be conducted to evaluate the role of screening-BAL in this patient population. Diagnostic/prognostic study, level III."

However, differences in quantity and timing of work between EGS and trauma patients affect demands on resources and staff. Hospital trauma, financial, pharmacy, and medical records of 100 successive trauma and 50 successive EGS patients were reviewed. Work performed by our service was quantified using relative value units, operations, complications, and laboratory tests/imaging/medications ordered, and the events organized by time intervals after contact by the acute care surgery service. Our estimators of surgeon work per patient, totaled over all studied time intervals, showed EGS exceeding trauma patients by 59% (laboratory tests) to 470% (operations) (all but one p < 0.01). The exception was that trauma patients required more imaging studies per patient (4.25 vs. 2.48, p < 0.01). Trauma patients had a mean time to primary diagnosis of 0.9 hours, compared to 4.3 hours in EGS patients. In this pilot effort, we found that EGS patients required more diagnostic effort initially and generated more relative value units, operations, laboratory tests, and new medication orders and had more complications during the course of their care.

We applied the DSS to 1,000 consecutive patients undergoing appendectomy from 1999 to 2009 and examined its association with outcomes (mortality, length of hospital stay, incidence of in-hospital, and postdischarge complications). Of the 1,000 patients, 82 were excluded owing to negative or interval appendectomy or advanced end-stage renal disease. Among 918 eligible patients, the DSS distribution was Grade 1 at 62.4%, Grade 2 at 13.0%, Grade 3 at 18.7%, Grade 4 at 4.4%, and Grade 5 at 1.5%. Statistical analyses indicated a stepwise risk increase in adverse outcomes with higher DSS grades (c statistics ≥ 0.75 for all outcomes). Covariates (age, sex, and type of surgical access) did not add to the predictive power of DSS. Based on this single-institution study, the proposed appendicitis DSS seems to be a useful tool.

Flat IVC was defined as diameter less than 2 cm. Fat IVC was defined as diameter greater than 2 cm. Need for intensive care unit admission, blood transfusion requirement, mortality, and need for emergent operation between patients with flat versus Fat IVC were compared. One hundred one hypotensive patients had LTTE performed in the ER. Average age was 38 years. Admission diagnosis was blunt trauma (n = 80), penetrating trauma (n = 13), acute care surgery pathology (n = 7), and burn (n = 1). Seventy-four patients had flat IVC on initial LTTE. Compared with those with fat IVC, flat patients were found have higher rates of intensive care unit admission (51.3 vs 14.8%; P = 0.001), blood transfusion requirement (12.2 vs 3.7%), and mortality (13.5 vs 3.7%). This population also underwent emergent surgery on hospital Day 1 more often (16.2 vs 0%; P = 0.033). Initial flat IVC on LTTE is an indicator of hypovolemia and a predictor of poor outcome."

    "abstract": "Acute care surgery (ACS) includes trauma, surgical critical care, and emergent general surgery. There is a national shortage of institutions that can provide for patients needing access to emergency surgical care. Inability to fund ACS surgeons can be a barrier. We hypothesize that an ACS service, in an appropriately staffed hospital, generates a positive contribution margin (CM). Fiscal data for 2009 were retrospectively reviewed at the University of Kentucky, a Level I trauma center with an ACS service. Contribution margin (ie, net revenue minus direct costs) and mean length of stay were calculated for all patients admitted to the ACS service. Inpatient data were stratified by trauma vs general surgery, emergent vs elective, and by payor mix. Annual CM associated with the 5 ACS faculty was $21,799,000. Trauma generated higher CM than general surgery. General surgery had a greater CM, more if emergent than if elective ($9,500 vs $5,500; p < 0.01). Self-payment was lower with emergent general surgery vs trauma (20% vs 25%; p = 0.02). Acute care surgery generates a positive CM. Emergent general surgery generates a greater CM than elective general surgery because of increased case mix index. These data suggest that hospital subsidization of acute care surgeons is financially feasible and might address the surgical workforce shortage and the critical problem of access to emergency surgical services."

The median time from arrival in the emergency department (ED) to surgery was reduced from 19 (18-21) h in the control group to 18 (17-19) h in the study group (P = 0.033). The time from booking surgery to operation was reduced from 4.8 (4.3-5.4) h to 3.9 (3.5-4.3) h (P < 0.0001). For patients undergoing emergency laparotomy, the time from booking to surgery was reduced from 3.1 (2.2-4.1) to 2.4 (1.8-2.9) h, and hospital stay was reduced from 13 (11-15) to 10 (9-12) days (P = 0.0089). The surgeons' responses to the questionnaires showed improvement in job satisfaction (P < 0.0001). This intervention has improved service delivery for emergency surgery patients, and improved the participating surgeons' job satisfaction."

    "abstract": "For patients who present to the emergency department (ED) with symptomatic cholelithiasis, surgery is indicated only if they are diagnosed of acute cholecystitis (AC). We hypothesized that, because preoperative signs and diagnostic tests are not sensitive enough to diagnose AC, coupled with the potential health care burden of non-AC gallbladder, surgery may be offered sooner. We prospectively evaluated 200 patients who presented to ED with clinical suspicion of gallbladder disease, including a right upper quadrant/epigastric abdominal pain and cholelithiasis, and who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We correlated the preoperative clinical findings, including ultrasonography results, with the surgeon's intraoperative assessment (OR-GB) and with the pathology report (PA-GB). A multiple logistic regression model was performed. Of the gallbladders, 116 were declared AC by OR-GB but only 54 by PA-GB, (r = 0.31, p < 0.001). The median time to surgery was 17 hours; 75% of the patients underwent surgery within 24 hours. The sensitivity of ultrasonography for AC according to PA-GB was 38%, and 16% when combined all preoperative findings. Both figures dropped to 27% and 11% when correlated to OR-GB. Our regression identified persistent abdominal pain, positive ultrasonography result, and a body mass index of greater than 40 to be significant predictors of AC according to PA-GB; however, only the persistent abdominal pain remained significant according to OR-GB. The study confirmed the lack of sensitivity of signs and diagnostic tools to diagnose AC. Because of the acute care surgery model, we believe that the approach to the patients who present to the ED with suspected gallbladder disease is to offer them surgery as soon as feasible, with or without AC. This approach will avoid an unnecessary delay as well as quickly relieve patient's pain and suffering; the health care system will benefit from a cost-effective reduction in number of outpatient referrals and repeated ED visits. Diagnostic study, level II."

    "abstract": "An acute care surgery (ACS) model was introduced to manage emergency surgical presentations efficiently. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of patient handover in an ACS model on the outcomes of adhesive small bowel obstruction (SBO). A retrospective study was performed on patients who were admitted with adhesive SBO at Prince of Wales Hospital. The cohort consisted of all patients treated by the ACS team from its introduction in September 2005 to February 2011. Patients in the ACS cohort were divided into two groups: those whose care was handed over to another surgeon and those whose care was not. These groups of patients were compared with a random sample of 50 patients in the pre-ACS period. In the ACS period, there was no significant difference in complication rates or length of hospital stay in those who were not handed over and those who were. A significantly higher proportion of operations took place during the day for the group who had been handed over (72.7% versus 36.7%; P = 0.005). There were no significant differences in complication rates or length of hospital stay in the pre-ACS and ACS period. Management under an ACS team does not increase adverse outcomes for adhesive SBO. Patients can be safely handed over within an ACS framework. Other members of the ACS team may help facilitate continuity of care."

    "abstract": "Subspecialisation within general surgery has today reached further than ever. However, on-call time, an unchanged need for broad surgical skills are required to meet the demands of acute surgical disease and trauma. The introduction of a new subspecialty in North America that deals solely with acute care surgery and trauma is an attempt to offer properly trained surgeons also during on-call time. To find out whether such a subspecialty could be helpful in Sweden we analyzed our workload for emergency surgery and trauma. Linköping University Hospital serves a population of 257 000. Data from 2010 for all patients, diagnoses, times and types of operations, surgeons involved, duration of stay, types of injury and deaths regarding emergency procedures were extracted from a prospectively-collected database and analyzed. There were 2362 admissions, 1559 emergency interventions; 835 were mainly abdominal operations, and 724 diagnostic or therapeutic endoscopies. Of the 1559 emergency interventions, 641 (41.1%) were made outside office hours, and of 453 minor or intermediate procedures (including appendicectomy, cholecystectomy, or proctological procedures) 276 (60.9%) were done during the evenings or at night. Two hundred and fifty-four patients were admitted with trauma and 29 (11.4%) required operation, of whom general surgeons operated on eight (3.1%). Thirteen consultants and 11 senior registrars were involved in 138 bowel resections and 164 cholecystectomies chosen as index operations for standard emergency surgery. The median (range) number of such operations done by each consultant was 6 (3-17) and 6 (1-22). Corresponding figures for senior registrars were 7 (0-11) and 8 (1-39). There was an uneven distribution of exposure to acute surgical problems and trauma among general surgeons. Some were exposed to only a few standard emergency interventions and most surgeons did not operate on a single patient with trauma. Further centralization of trauma care, long-term positions at units for emergency surgery and trauma, and subspecialisation in the fields of emergency surgery and trauma, might be options to solve problems of low volumes."

    "title": "Creation of an emergency surgery service concentrates resident training in general surgical procedures.",
    "abstract": "Emergency general surgery (EGS) is increasingly being provided by academic trauma surgeons in an acute care surgery model. Our tertiary care hospital recently changed from a model where all staff surgeons (private, subspecialty academic, and trauma academic) were assigned EGS call to one in which an emergency surgery service (ESS), staffed by academic trauma faculty, cares for all EGS patients. In the previous model, many surgeries were \"not covered\" by residents because of work-hour restrictions, conflicting needs, or private surgeon preference. The ESS was separate from the trauma service. We hypothesize that by creating a separate ESS, residents can accumulate needed and concentrated operative experience in a well-supervised academic environment. A prospectively accrued EGS database was retrospectively queried for the 18-month period: July 2010 to June 2011. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) databases were queried for operative numbers for our residency program and for national resident data for 2 years before and after creating the ESS. The ACGME operative requirements were tabulated from online sources. ACGME requirements were compared with surgical cases performed. During the 18-month period, 816 ESS operations were performed. Of these, 307 (38%) were laparoscopy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and appendectomy were most common (138 and 145, respectively) plus 24 additional laparoscopic surgeries. Each resident performed, on average, 34 basic laparoscopic cases during their 2-month rotation, which is 56% of their ACGME basic laparoscopic requirement. A diverse mixture of 70 other general surgical operations was recorded for the remaining 509 surgical cases, including reoperative surgery, complex laparoscopy, multispecialty procedures, and seldom-performed operations such as surgery for perforated ulcer disease. Before the ESS, the classes of 2008 and 2009 reported that only 48% and 50% of cases were performed at the main academic institution, respectively. This improved for the classes of 2010 and 2011 to 63% and 68%, respectively, after ESS creation. An ESS rotation is becoming essential in large teaching hospitals by helping to fulfill ACGME requirements and by providing emergent general surgical skills an efficient and well-supervised academic environment. Movement toward concentrating EGS on a single service can enhance resident education and may decrease the need to supplement certain aspects of general surgery education with away rotations."

    "abstract": "To describe the outcomes of elderly patients with do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status who undergo emergency general surgery and to improve understanding of the relationship between preoperative DNR status and postoperative mortality. Preoperative DNR status has previously been shown to predict increased postoperative mortality, although the reasons for this association are not well understood. Patients 65 years or older undergoing emergency operation for 1 of 10 common general surgical diagnoses were extracted from the 2005-2010 National Surgical Quality Improvement database. Propensity score techniques were used to match patients with and without preoperative DNR orders on indication for procedure, patient demographics, comorbid disease burden, acute physical status at the time of operation, and procedure complexity. The postoperative outcomes of this matched cohort were then compared. A total of 25,558 patients were included for analysis (DNR, n =1061; non-DNR, n =24,497). DNR patients seemed to be more acutely and chronically ill than non-DNR patients in the overall study sample but did not seem to be treated less aggressively before or during their operations. Propensity-matching techniques resulted in the creation of a cohort of DNR and non-DNR patients who were well matched for all preoperative and intraoperative variables. DNR patients from the matched cohort had a significantly higher postoperative mortality rate than non-DNR patients (36.9% vs 22.3%, P < 0.0001) despite having a similar rate of major postoperative complications (42.1% vs 40.2%, P = 0.38). DNR patients in the propensity-matched cohort were much less likely to undergo reoperation (8.3% vs 12.0%, P = 0.006) than non-DNR patients and were significantly more likely to die in the setting of a major postoperative complication (56.7% vs 41.4%, P = 0.001). Emergency general surgery in elderly patients with preoperative DNR orders is associated with significant rates of postoperative morbidity and mortality. One reason for the excess mortality in these patients, relative to otherwise similar patients who do not have preoperative DNR orders, may be their greater reluctance to pursue aggressive management of major complications in the postoperative period."

    "abstract": "The acute care surgery model is a novel notion in the provision of emergency general surgery. To date, several studies have analyzed the effects on patient health outcomes and timeliness of care for nontrauma patients within the scope of acute general surgery and emergencies, but none have assessed the cost benefits of this model. A retrospective analysis of patients undergoing appendectomy or cholecystectomy in the setting of acute abdomen was performed to compare data from 2 cohorts, the traditional model from July 2009 to June 2010 and the acute care surgery model from July 2010 to June 2011. Categorical variables and comparison means were examined using chi-square and independent 2-tailed sample t-tests. One hundred and seventy-five patients underwent appendectomy and 113 underwent cholecystectomy. The traditional model team staffed 82 appendectomies and 51 cholecystectomies, and the acute care surgery team staffed 93 and 62, respectively. In the appendectomy group, there was a statistically significant mean reduction of time to surgical evaluation (2.19 hours; p < 0.001) and time to the operating room (5.38 hours, p = 0.006), there were 7 fewer patients with complications (p = 0.06) and a reduced length of stay (1 day, p = 0.002) for the acute care surgery cohort. Similar statistically significant differences were observed in the cholecystectomy group in the acute care surgery cohort: surgical evaluation difference = 5.84 hours (p = 0.03), time to operating room difference = 25.37 hours (p = 0.002), 8 fewer patients with complications (p = 0.01), and length of stay difference was 2 days (p = 0.03) compared with the traditional model cohort. The newly implemented acute care surgery model in our institution accomplished earlier treatment and shorter length of stay for the 2 most common causes of acute abdomen in our setting. Overall, the new model translated to better outcomes for patients and savings per case for the hospital."

Previous studies have demonstrated that increased frailty is a predictor of outcomes in medicine and surgical patients. We hypothesized that use of a modification of the Canadian Study of Health and Aging Frailty Index would be a predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients older than 60 years undergoing emergency general surgery. Data were obtained from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Participant Use Files database in compliance with the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Data Use Agreement. We selected all emergency cases in patients older than 60 years performed by general surgeons from 2005 to 2009. The effect of increasing frailty on multiple outcomes including wound infection, wound occurrence, any infection, any occurrence, and mortality was then evaluated. Total sample size was 35,334 patients. As the modified frailty index increased, associated increases occurred in wound infection, wound occurrence, any infection, any occurrence, and mortality. Logistic regression of multiple variables demonstrated that the frailty index was associated with increased mortality with an odds ratio of 11.70 (p < 0.001). Frailty index is an important predictive variable in emergency general surgery patients older than 60 years. The modified frailty index can be used to evaluate risk of both morbidity and mortality in these patients. Frailty index will be a valuable preoperative risk assessment tool for the acute care surgeon. Prognostic study, level II."

    "abstract": "Acute care surgeons are uniquely aware of the importance of systemic inflammatory response and its influence on postoperative outcomes; concepts like damage control have evolved from this experience. For surgeons whose practice is mostly elective, the significance of such systemic inflammation may be underappreciated. This study sought to determine the influence of preoperative systemic inflammation on postoperative outcome in patients requiring emergent colon surgery. Emergent colorectal operations were identified in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program 2008 dataset. Four groups were defined by the presence and magnitude of the inflammatory response before operation: no inflammation, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, or severe sepsis/septic shock. Thirty-day survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method. A total of 3,305 patients were identified. Thirty-day survival was significantly different (p < 0.0001) among the four groups; increasing magnitudes of preoperative inflammation had increasing probability of mortality (p < 0.0001). Hazard ratios indicated that, compared with patients without preoperative systemic inflammation, the relative risk of death from SIRS was 1.9 (p < 0.0001), from sepsis was 2.5 (p < 0.0001), and from severe sepsis/septic shock was 6.7 (p < 0.0001). Operative time of <150 minutes was associated with decreased risk of morbidity (odds ratio = 0.64; p < 0.0001). Upregulation of the systemic inflammatory response is the primary contributor to death in emergency surgical patients. In SIRS or sepsis patients, operations <2.5 hours are associated with fewer postoperative complications. These results further reinforce the concept of timely surgical intervention and suggest a potential role for damage control operations in emergency general surgery. II, prognostic study."

Retrospective cohort study comparing hospital performance in trauma and EMGS care and in trauma and ELGS care.

Forty-six hospitals. Correlations of observed to expected ratios were examined. Outlier status (hospitals with CIs of observed to expected ratios excluding 1.0) was compared using weighted .

No hospitals were consistently low or high outliers across all 3 groups. Trauma performance improvement programs are well established compared with those for EMGS. Although EMGS patients use similar structures and processes as trauma patients, there is a lack of correlation between the quality of care provided to trauma and EMGS patients; EMGS should be incorporated into trauma performance improvement programs."

The total ACS-dependent time was 127 minutes compared with 261 minutes for initial ED activities and 104 minutes for transfer to a hospital ward (P < .05). Forty percent of patients underwent computed tomography (CT) imaging (76% before consultation). The time to ACS consultation was 305 minutes when a CT scan was performed first.

The aim of this project is to examine the impact in terms of work relative value units (wRVUs), collections, and cases in both groups with creation of an acute care surgery service at our institution. Work RVUs, collections, and case volume were examined from departmental records for 2 groups before and after acute care surgery service creation. The service began on September 1, 2008. Before this time, emergency surgical consults went to the general surgeon on call. After this date, all emergency consults were seen by acute care surgeons. The number of operations performed by the acute care surgery group increased significantly when the mean of the 2 years after institution of acute care surgery were compared with the mean of the 2 years preceding the service creation (1,639 vs 790/year; p = 0.007). There was no change in total operations done by the elective surgery group (2,763 vs 2,496/year: p = 0.13). Elective caseload, however, did increase by 23% in the elective surgery group. In the acute care surgery group, wRVUs increased by 140% and elective surgery group wRVUs decreased by 8%. Collections increased in both groups (acute care surgery 129%, elective surgery 7%) and the combined collections of the groups increased by $2,138,00 in the year after service creation. Acute care surgery service creation took emergency business from the elective surgery group, but this was almost immediately replaced with elective cases. This resulted in higher collections for both groups and a resultant significant increase in collections in aggregate."

    "abstract": "Hypertension is common in hospitalized patients and there are many causes. Some patients have no prior history of hypertension, few symptoms, and no apparent morbidity related to acute rises in blood pressure. Though there is no established guideline for therapy in these cases, patients often receive therapy directed at the abnormal vital sign. It is hypothesized that this practice is common and the associated costs are significant. Using the inpatient pharmacy database at the University of Kentucky Chandler Medical Center, a verified Level I trauma center and quaternary referral center, patients on the emergency general surgery or orthopedic surgery services receiving intravenous hydralazine, metoprolol, or labetalol were identified. Subjects were analyzed for indications, parameters, associated history of hypertension, and direct costs. Over the 4-month study period, 114 subjects received 522 drug doses. More than half (55%) of subjects had a prior history of hypertension but only 75 per cent were started on their home medication. Of those without hypertension before admission, 18 per cent required therapy at discharge. Labetalol was the most frequently used agent and total pharmacy costs for this cohort of patients was over $1200. Pro re nata (PRN), short-acting antihypertensive therapy has little evidence base in asymptomatic patients, but its prevalence is high on surgical services. The cost is significant, especially when extrapolated to the larger hospital population at this single institution. Further research is warranted to determine the prevalence of this practice in other centers or national regions, as well as its cost and benefit."

To address this challenge, the American Association for Surgery of Trauma has developed a fellowship in acute care surgery (ACS) to reestablish broad-based surgical capabilities. But the viability of this new discipline will rest on the interests of the next generation of surgeons. The objective of this study was to determine key factors influencing the choice of surgical specialties among medical students with a focus on their interest in trauma/ACS (T/ACS). An online questionnaire was distributed to students at four medical schools affiliated with Level I trauma centers, one of which also has an ACS fellowship. The survey was sent to medical students at all levels (first to fourth year). Students with an interest in surgery as a career were asked to complete the survey and rank factors and experiences influencing career selection on a scale of 1 (no influence) to 10 (critical). Students were also asked to select their top five surgical specialties. Three hundred thirty-seven students interested in surgery responded. Mean age was 26 years ± 0.2 years (range, 20-37 years), 58% were men, and 86% were single. Respondents were distributed evenly over medical schools and medical school years. The three most popular career choices were orthopedics (16%), T/ACS (12%), and pediatric surgery (8%). As students progressed through medical school, lifestyle factors such as predictable hours and family time became more important in influencing their career choice. Overall, 115 students (34%) selected emergent surgery (T/ACS) as one of their top three career choices. Factors that were ranked significantly higher by students interested in T/ACS were related to professional satisfaction. These students also placed less emphasis on lifestyle factors when choosing a surgical career. Our results indicate that there is a reassuring interest to address the growing demand for emergency surgery among current medical students exposed to a broad range of T/ACS patients in Level I trauma centers. The T/ACS model is in accordance with the drives of these students looking for a diverse and challenging profession. Academic societies should make further efforts to encourage medical students to pursue T/ACS."

The goal of this study was to establish diagnostic ICD-9 codes to define EGS patients. The hypothesis was that creating standardized ICD-9-based inclusion criteria would facilitate patient identification for an EGSR and aid in its ongoing development. We conducted a retrospective review of EGS admissions over a 9-month period to define ICD-9 diagnostic codes of patients admitted to our EGS service. Subsequently, prospective data were collected into the EGSR by testing ICD-9-based inclusion criteria over 1 month. Patient, hospital, and severity scoring variables, as well as quality assurance information, were identified. We identified 959 admissions to the EGS service over 9 months with 306 ICD-9 diagnosis codes that define EGS patients; the prospective population of the EGSR confirmed feasibility of ICD-9-based inclusion criteria. The EGSR captures 107 data points and 33 comorbidities per patient over 11 categories, akin to the 10 NTDB categories. Following the model of the NTDB, we have successfully completed creation and initial implementation of an EGSR by using ICD-9-based inclusion criteria. Our comprehensive EGSR creates a prospective data-collection modality to capture and define EGS patients. A uniform patient-tracking EGSR, akin to the NTDB, will advance the science of acute care surgery, improve EGS patient outcomes, and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration."

This study examines the impact of ACS on the timeliness of care and length of hospitalization for patients with acute cholecystitis. A retrospective cohort study was performed of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute cholecystitis who underwent early cholecystectomy. Patients with choledocholithiasis, pancreatitis, biliary colic, or cholelithiasis without cholecystitis were excluded. There were two study cohorts: ACS (October 2009 to July 2010) and pre-ACS (October 2008 to September 2009). Primary outcome measures were length of stay (LOS) and time from the ED to the operating room (OR). One hundred fifty-two cases were identified: 71 in the ACS group and 81 in the pre-ACS group. Patient demographics were similar. The ACS group had a significantly shorter average time from the ED to the OR (24.6 vs 35.0 hours, P = 0.0276). Overall LOS was reduced by a mean of 14.7 hours in the ACS group (mean 3.23 vs 2.63 days, P = 0.11). There was no significant difference in OR time (2.45 vs 2.38 hours, P = 0.562). There was a significant decrease in after-hours cases in the ACS group (5.6 vs 21%, P = 0.004) and a decrease in complication rates (18.5 vs 7.0%, P = 0.032).

    "abstract": "To examine the case mix and patient characteristics and outcomes of the nontrauma emergency (NTE) service in an academic Division of Acute Care Surgery. An NTE service (attending, chief resident, postgraduate year-3 and postgraduate year-2 residents, and two physician assistants) was created in July 2005 for all urgent and emergent inpatient and emergency department general surgery patient consults and admissions. An NTE database was created with prospective data collection of all NTE admissions initiated from November 1, 2007. Prospective data were collected by a dedicated trauma registrar and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-intensive care unit (ICU) coordinator daily. NTE case mix and ICU characteristics were reviewed for the 2-year time period January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2009. During the same time period, trauma operative cases and procedures were examined and compared with the NTE case mix. Thousand seven hundred eight patients were admitted to the NTE service during this time period (789 in 2008 and 910 in 2009). Surgical intervention was required in 70% of patients admitted to the NTE service. Exploratory laparotomy or laparoscopy was performed in 449 NTE patients, comprising 37% of all surgical procedures. In comparison, only 118 trauma patients (5.9% of admissions) required a major laparotomy or thoracotomy during the same time period. Acuity of illness of NTE patients was high, with a significant portion (13%) of NTE patients requiring ICU admission. NTE patients had higher admission Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III scores [61.2 vs. 58.8 (2008); 58.2 vs. 55.8 (2009)], increased mortality [(9.71% vs. 4.89% (2008); 6.78% vs. 5.16% (2009)], and increased readmission rates (15.5% vs. 7.4%) compared with the total surgical ICU (SICU) admissions. In an era of declining operative caseload in trauma, the NTE service provides ample opportunity for complex general surgery decision making and operative procedures for surgical residency education, including advanced surgical critical care management. In addition, creation of an NTE service provides an optimal general surgery case mix, including major abdominal operations, that can augment declining trauma surgery caseloads, maintain acute care faculty surgical skills, and support general and acute care surgery residency training."

    "title": "Impact of acute care surgery to departmental productivity.",
    "abstract": "The face of trauma surgery is rapidly evolving with a paradigm shift toward acute care surgery (ACS). The formal development of ACS has been viewed by some general surgeons as a threat to their practice. We sought to evaluate the impact of a new division of ACS to both departmental productivity and provider satisfaction at a University Level I Trauma Center. Two-year retrospective analysis of annual work relative value unit (wRVU) productivity, operative volume, and FTEs before and after establishment of an ACS division at a University Level I trauma center. Provider satisfaction was measured using a 10-point scale. Analysis completed using Microsoft Excel with a p value less than 0.05 significant. The change to an ACS model resulted in a 94% increase in total wRVU production (78% evaluation and management, 122% operative; p<0.05) for ACS, whereas general surgery wRVU production increased 8% (-15% evaluation and management, 14% operative; p<0.05). Operative productivity was substantial after transition to ACS, with 129% and 44% increases (p<0.05) in operative and elective case load, respectively. Decline in overall general surgery operative volume was attributed to reduction in emergent cases. Establishment of the ACS model necessitated one additional FTE. Job satisfaction substantially improved with the ACS model while allowing general surgery a more focused practice. The ACS practice model significantly enhances provider productivity and job satisfaction when compared with trauma alone. Fears of a productivity impact to the nontrauma general surgeon were not realized."

    "abstract": "Relaparotomy after emergency surgery for nontrauma intraabdominal catastrophes (NTIAC) is morbid. Our objective was to identify patients who likely will need on-demand relaparotomy after surgery for NTIAC. A retrospective chart review of patients from 1998 to 2008 identified cases of NTIAC surgery with fascial closure. Demographics, comorbidities, intraoperative findings, morbidity, and mortality were analyzed. Relaparotomy was defined as any return to the operating room with surgical re-entry of the abdominal cavity. A total of 129 patients underwent NTIAC surgery with fascial closure. Twenty-nine patients (22%) required relaparotomy and 100 patients (78%) did not. Multivariate analysis identified the following predictors of relaparotomy: peripheral vascular disease (P = .04), alcohol abuse (P = .02), body mass index of 29 kg/m(2) or greater (P = .04), the finding of any ischemic bowel (P = .02), and operating room latency of 60 hours or longer (P = .01). Patients with 2 or more of these predictors had a 55% risk of relaparotomy whereas patients with fewer than 2 of these predictors had a 9% risk (P < .001). Patients whose fascia is closed during NTIAC surgery do worse when they require relaparotomy. We have identified preoperative and intraoperative predictors that may help identify patients at high risk of on-demand relaparotomy."

This study aimed to evaluate the contribution of the Veterans Affairs (VA) general surgery surgical experience to both index Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) requirements and as a unique integrated model in which residents provide concurrent care of multiple specialty patients. Institutional review board approval was obtained for retrospective analysis of electronic medical records involving all surgical cases performed by the general surgery service from 2005 to 2009 at the Nashville VA. Over a 5-year span general surgery residents spent an average of 5 months on the VA general surgery service, which includes a postgraduate year (PGY)-5, PGY-3, and 2 PGY-1 residents. Surgeries involved the following specialties: surgical oncology, endocrine, colorectal, hepatobiliary, transplant, gastrointestinal laparoscopy, and elective and emergency general surgery. The surgeries were categorized according to ACGME index requirements. A total of 2,956 surgeries were performed during the 5-year period from 2005 through 2009. Residents participated in an average of 246 surgeries during their experience at the VA; approximately 50 cases are completed during the chief year. On the VA surgery service alone, 100% of the ACGME requirement was met for the following categories: endocrine (8 cases); skin, soft tissue, and breast (33 cases); alimentary tract (78 cases); and abdominal (88 cases). Approximately 50% of the ACGME requirement was met for liver, pancreas, and basic laparoscopic categories. The VA hospital provides an authentic, broad-based, general surgery training experience that integrates complex surgical patients simultaneously. Opportunities for this level of comprehensive care are decreasing or absent in many general surgery training programs. The increasing level of responsibility and simultaneous care of multiple specialty patients through the VA hospital systems offers a crucial experience for those pursuing a career in general surgery."

    "abstract": "During the initial development of an Emergency General Surgery (EGS) service, severity of illness (SOI) can be expected to be high and should decrease as the service matures. We hypothesize that a matured regional EGS service would show decreasing mortality and length of stay (LOS) over time. We performed a retrospective study of a prospectively collected EGS registry data from 2004 to 2009. Patients were included if they had been discharged from the EGS service and were stratified by year of discharge. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, shock, peritonitis, perforation, and acute renal failure were used as markers of SOI. Patients were defined as high acuity if they had one or more of these SOI markers. Differences in mortality, LOS, intensive care unit admissions, SOI, charges, and distance were compared across and between years using nonparametric statistical tests (Fisher's exact, Wilcoxon rank-sum, and Kruskal-Wallis tests). A total of 3,439 patients met study criteria. The mean age was 47 years ± 17.5 years. The majority of the patients were female (1,813, 47.3%). The overall LOS was 6.4 days ± 9.4 days (median, 4 days). In all, 2,331 (67.8%) of the patients underwent operation. Over the course of the study period, the SOI indicators stabilized at between 13% and 17% of the patient population with at least one indicator. During that time period, mortality steadily decreased from 4.9% to 1.3% (p < 0.5). Despite consistently high SOI, a dedicated and matured EGS service demonstrated a decrease in mortality and LOS."

The Acute Care Surgery training initiative promotes an expansion of trauma/surgical care and operative domain, redirecting some of our focus from critical care. Will we be able to train and enforce enough intensivists to care for critically ill surgical patients? We have been training emergency physicians (EPs) alongside surgeons in our country's largest Trauma/Surgical Critical Care Fellowship Program annually for more than a decade. We reviewed our Society of Critical Care Medicine Multidisciplinary Critical Care Knowledge Assessment Program (MCCKAP, critical care in-training examination) scores from 2006 to 2009 (4 years). The MCCKAP, administered during the ninth month of a Critical Care Fellowship, is the only known standardized objective examination available in this country to compare critical care knowledge acquisition across different specialties. Subsequent workforce outcome for these Emergency Medicine Critical Care Fellowship graduates was analyzed. Over the 4-year period, we trained 42 Fellows in our Program who qualified for this study (30 surgeons and 12 EPs). Surgeons and EP performance scores on the MCCKAP examination were not different. The mean National Board Equivalent score was 419 ± 61 (mean ± standard deviation) for surgeons and 489 ± 87 for EPs. The highest score was achieved by an EP. The lowest score was not achieved by an EP. Ten of 12 (83%) EP Critical Care Fellowship graduates are practicing inpatient critical care in intensive care units with attending physician level responsibilities. EPs training in a Surgical Critical Care Fellowship can acquire critical care knowledge equivalent to that of surgeons. EPs trained in a Surgical Critical Care paradigm can potentially expand the intensive care unit workforce for Surgical Critical Care patients."

    "abstract": "We sought to determine which of 3 methods used to evaluate cardiac index (CI) is the most accurate using focused bedside echocardiography (ECHO). We hypothesized that the fractional shortening (FS) method would provide a more accurate estimate of CI than the left ventricular outflow tract/velocity-time integral (LVOT/VTI) or Simpson's methods. This was a prospective observational cohort study conducted in the surgical ICU of an urban level 1 trauma center utilizing all patients with a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) in place. Three surgical intensive care unit (SICU) faculty and 3 fellows underwent focused cardiac ultrasound training. Focused ECHO exams-bedside echocardiographic assessment in trauma/critical care (BEAT)- were performed using the Sonosite portable ultrasound device (Bothall, Washington). Stroke volume (SV) measurements were prospectively obtained on all trauma/SICU patients, with a PAC in place, using FS, LVOT/VTI, and Simpson's methods. The investigators were blinded to the PAC data. From each measurement, CI was calculated and categorized as low, normal, or high, based on a normal range of 2.4 to 4.0 L/min per m(2). Each CI obtained from the PAC was similarly categorized. The association between the BEAT and PAC estimates of CI was evaluated for each method using chi-square goodness of fit. Eighty five BEAT exams were performed on consecutive SICU patients, 56% were on trauma and 44% on emergency general surgery patients. There was a statistically significant association between the CI estimate using the FS method (P = .012), but not the LVOT/VTI (P = .33) or Simpson's method (P = .74). Our data showed a significant association between the PAC estimate of CI and our estimate using the FS method. The other methods were difficult to obtain, subjective, and inaccurate. Fractional shortening was the method of choice to estimate CI for the BEAT exam performed by intensivists in SICU patients."

    "abstract": "The elderly (age ≥65 years) comprise an increasing proportion of patients undergoing emergency general surgery (EGS) procedures and have distinct needs compared with the young. We postulated that the needs of the elderly require different processes of care than those required for the young to assure optimal outcomes. To explore this hypothesis, we evaluated 30-day outcomes following EGS procedures in the young and the elderly and determined whether hospital performance was consistent across these 2 age strata. With data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (2005 to 2008), regression models were constructed for serious morbidity and mortality for all patients undergoing EGS procedures and separately for young and elderly patients. These models allowed for estimation of the risk of adverse outcomes associated with advanced age and the generation of hospital-level observed to expected (O/E) ratios. We evaluated the correlation between hospital O/E ratios for the young and the elderly and the concordance of outlier status (hospitals with CIs of O/E ratios excluding 1) with weighted κ across these 2 age groups. Among 68,003 procedures at 186 hospitals, elderly patients had a higher crude and adjusted risk for serious morbidity (27.9% versus 9.7%, p < 0.0001; odds ratio 1.17, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.24) and mortality (15.2% versus 2.5%, p < 0.0001; odds ratio 2.29, 95% CI 2.09 to 2.51). When outcomes for elderly versus younger patients were compared, there was fair to moderate agreement on hospital performance for serious morbidity (r = 0.43; κ = 0.30) but not for mortality (r = 0.10; κ = 0.17). Elderly patients are at substantially greater risk for adverse events following EGS procedures. Hospitals had only slight agreement in mortality outcomes in the elderly compared with those in young patients. Processes of care that may account for this disparity should be further investigated."

    "abstract": "Surgical resident rotations on trauma services are criticized for little operative experience and heavy workloads. This has resulted in diminished interest in trauma surgery among surgical residents. Acute care surgery (ACS) combines trauma and emergency/elective general surgery, enhancing operative volume and balancing operative and nonoperative effort. We hypothesize that a mature ACS service provides significant operative experience. A retrospective review was performed of ACGME case logs of 14 graduates from a major, academic, Level I trauma center program during a 3-year period. Residency Review Committee index case volumes during the fourth and fifth years of postgraduate training (PGY-4 and PGY-5) ACS rotations were compared with other service rotations: in total and per resident week on service. Ten thousand six hundred fifty-four cases were analyzed for 14 graduates. Mean cases per resident was 432 ± 57 in PGY-4, 330 ± 40 in PGY-5, and 761 ± 67 for both years combined. Mean case volume on ACS for both years was 273 ± 44, which represented 35.8% (273 of 761) of the total experience and exceeded all other services. Residents averaged 8.9 cases per week on the ACS service, which exceeded all other services except private general surgery, gastrointestinal/minimally invasive surgery, and pediatric surgery rotations. Disproportionately more head/neck, small and large intestine, gastric, spleen, laparotomy, and hernia cases occurred on ACS than on other services. Residents gain a large operative experience on ACS. An ACS model is viable in training, provides valuable operative experience, and should not be considered a drain on resident effort. Valuable ACS rotation experiences as a resident may encourage graduates to pursue ACS as a career."

    "abstract": "Emergency surgery patients risk greater mortality and morbidity than elective patients undergoing the same procedure.

This study sought to characterize costs and outcomes of elective versus emergent right hemicolectomy. 2006 Nationwide Inpatient Sample data were used to compare mortality, total charges, and length of stay (LOS) in patients undergoing emergency versus elective right hemicolectomy (International Classification of Diseases-9th procedure code 45.73). Mann-Whitney tests examined total costs and LOS; multivariable regression modeled inhospital mortality controlling for age, gender, insurance status, and comorbidities. Among 8,074,825 inpatient admissions, 7,767 emergent and 10,399 elective right hemicolectomies were identified. Emergent patients were similar in age (66.9 years vs. 67.6 years; p=0.129), more likely women (43.7% vs. 42.3%; p=0.048) and had greater comorbidity (Charlson score 3.37 vs. 3.01; p<0.001) compared with elective patients. Emergent patient LOS was approximately double that of elective patients (13 days vs. 7 days; p<0.001). Mean total charges were $78,118 for emergent versus $39,265 elective patients (p<0.001). Emergent patients had greater odds of inhospital mortality (odds ratio, 5.86; 95% confidence intervals, 4.80-7.14). Emergent right hemicolectomy patients have greater comorbidity, experience longer stays, accrue twice the charges, and have higher mortality risk. This reflects a heightened effort required to care for emergent patients unrecognized by Global Surgical Package reimbursement. The concentration of emergency surgical patients in acute care surgery services necessitates accounting for the additional effort associated with these predictable risks to ensure optimal care."

In 2003 the Texas legislature passed a comprehensive package of tort reform laws that included a cap at $250,000 on noneconomic damages in most medical malpractice cases. We hypothesized that tort reform laws significantly reduce the risk of malpractice lawsuit in an academic medical center. We compared malpractice prevalence, incidence, and liability costs before and after comprehensive state tort reform measures were implemented. Two prospectively maintained institutional databases were used to calculate and characterize malpractice risk: a surgical operation database and a risk management and malpractice database. Risk groups were divided into pretort reform (1992 to 2004) and post-tort reform groups (2004 to the present). Operative procedures were included for elective, urgent, and emergency general surgery procedures. During the study period, 98,513 general surgical procedures were performed. A total of 28 lawsuits (25 pre-reform, 3 postreform) were filed, naming general surgery faculty or residents. The prevalence of lawsuits filed/100,000 procedures performed is as follows: before reform, 40 lawsuits/100,000 procedures, and after reform, 8 lawsuits/100,000 procedures (p < 0.01, relative risk 0.21 [95% CI 0.063 to 0.62]). Virtually all of the liability and defense cost was in the pretort reform period: $595,000/year versus $515/year in the postreform group (p < 0.01). Implementation of comprehensive tort reform in Texas was associated with a significant decrease in the prevalence and cost of surgical malpractice lawsuits at one academic medical center."

Age, sex, blood glucose level, creatinine level, albumin level, surgery duration, and smoking were independent predictors of morbidity. Emergency general surgery patients with postoperative complications are likely to be older, male, smokers, have increased blood glucose and creatinine levels, lower albumin levels, and longer surgical times.

We hypothesized that EGS outcomes in TCs would be similar to outcomes in non-trauma centers (NTC); failure to support our hypothesis suggests that the effects of trauma performance improvement have extended beyond trauma patients. We retrospectively studied EGS procedures at TCs versus NTCs among American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program participants (2005-2008). Thirty-day outcomes were overall morbidity, serious morbidity, and mortality. TC versus NTC outcomes were compared using regression modeling, observed-to-expected (O/E) ratios (among hospitals submitting ≥20 EGS procedures), and outlier status (hospitals whose O/E confidence interval excludes 1.0). Of 68,003 patients at 222 hospitals, 42,264 (62.2%) were treated at 121 TCs; 25,739 (37.8%) were treated at 101 NTCs.

On adjusted analyses, TC status was a significant predictor of overall morbidity (odds ratio = 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01-1.21), but not serious morbidity (odds ratio = 1.08; 95% CI, 0.98-1.19) or mortality (odds ratio = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.82-1.04). Among 211 hospitals assigned O/E ratios, TCs were more likely, although not significantly so, to be high outliers for overall morbidity (7.6% versus 4.3%; p = 0.017), serious morbidity (5.1% versus 4.3%; p = 0.034), and mortality (3.4% versus 2.2%; p > 0.099). Although overall morbidity tended to favor NTCs, mortality was no different. This suggests that the trauma performance improvement processes have not been applied to EGS patients, despite being cared for by similar providers. Despite having processes for trauma, there remains the opportunity for quality improvement for EGS care."

Little is known about neurosurgical attitudes toward this proposal and alternative methods of improving access to emergency neurosurgical care.

Ninety-nine attendees participated in polling, broadly representing private (45%) and academic (34%) practices from all regions of the United States. Eighty-nine percent reported taking emergency calls (75% at least twice per week), with the majority (57%) not receiving a stipend. Only 9% responded that routine emergency cases are frequently transferred from their hospital. The majority (60%) either agreed or strongly agreed that there are problems with neurosurgery emergency coverage in their region. Before the session, 89% were opposed to the acute care surgery initiative as a solution for neurosurgery emergency coverage and 85% favored regionalization of emergency care. Opinions did not change significantly following expert presentations and discussion. Neurosurgeons polled during a 2008 CNS consensus session opposed creation of an acute care surgery specialty within general surgery that covers neurosurgical emergencies, but they favored neurosurgical emergency care regionalization.

Practice patterns of trauma and SCC surgeons and opinions about the ACS model. Fifty-seven of 87 SCC program directors responded. Almost all programs are associated with level I trauma centers with as many as 15 trauma surgeons. Most of these trauma surgeons cover SCC and emergency general surgery. Sixty-six percent of surgical intensive care units are semiclosed; 89.0% have surgeons as directors. Seventy percent of the staff in surgical intensive care units are surgeons. One hundred fifty-five of approximately 1100 Surgery Section of the Society of Critical Care Medicine members who responded to the other survey did not believe that the ACS model would compromise surgical intensive care unit and trauma care or trainee education yet would allow surgeons to maintain their surgical skills. Respondents were less likely to believe that the ACS fellowship would be important financially, increase resident interest, or improve patient care. In academic medical centers, surgical intensivists already practice the ACS model but depend on many nonsurgeons. Surgical intensivists believe that ACS will not compromise care or education and will help maintain the field, although the effect on resident interest is unclear."

We hypothesized that trauma and EGS can be successfully integrated in an academic institution. Retrospective review of prospectively collected trauma/EGS database was conducted at a high-volume, urban academic level I trauma center. Patients admitted to or requested consultation from trauma and EGS services were included. We explored the covariates affecting time to operating room (TOR), morbidity and in-hospital mortality rate. There were 1794 trauma patients and 1565 EGS patients identified over a 6-month period. Linear regression models failed to demonstrate a correlation between TOR and surgical team workload (WL), injury severity score (ISS), and caseload for the operating room staff and facility. While lower TOR, Glasgow coma scale, ISS and age were associated with an increased likelihood of complications, WL did not correlate with the occurrence of complications. TOR and surgical team WL had no association with death in trauma patients. The occurrence of complications was associated with a nearly 8-fold increase in the risk of death (odds ratio 7.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.49-39.32, P = 0.02). Increased workload during combined trauma/EGS call in an acute care surgery model did not affect the TOR nor worsen patient outcome. Implementation of a trauma/EGS model is justified even in high-volume academic institutions, if appropriately staffed and resourced."

We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected EGS registry from 2004 to 2008. The study population consisted of all patients discharged from the EGS service with an available home zip code in the registry. Study data included age, gender, length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit (ICU) LOS, distance between our facility and patient home zip code, and need for operative management. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome/sepsis/shock, peritonitis, perforation, and acute renal failure were used as SOI indicators. Mortality at discharge was the primary outcome. Patients were stratified by survival and compared using non-parametric statistical tests. Logistic regression assessed the simultaneous contribution of age, SOI, and distance to risk of death. A total of 3,439 patients met study criteria. Females slightly outnumbered males (1,813, 52.7%) with a median age of 47 years. The overall LOS was 6.4 days±9.3 days, and 2,331 (67.8%) of the patients underwent operation. Mean distance was 41.5 miles±51.2 miles (median, 22.2). Overall mortality was 2.7%. Increasing distance, age, and presence of SOI indicators were associated with mortality in univariable analyses. In multivariable logistic regression controlling for patient age and SOI, increasing distance in miles was related to increased mortality (odds ratio, 1.005; p<0.001). This odds ratio equates to a doubling in odds of death for each 132 miles between our center and the patient's home zip code. Age, SOI, and distance from a regional referral center explain much of the variation in mortality and can be used for triage to regional EGS centers."

Observed-to-expected (O/E) ratios were calculated from models based on EMGS or ELGS patients. Association of hospital performance after EMGS versus ELGS procedures was assessed by evaluating correlations of O/E ratios; agreement in outlier status (hospitals where O/E confidence intervals [CI] do not overlap 1.0) was evaluated with weighted kappa. Of 473,619 procedures, 67,445 (14.2%) patients underwent an EMGS procedure. EMGS patients were more likely to experience any morbidity (odds ratio [OR] 1.20; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.23), serious morbidity (OR 1.26; 95% CI 1.21 to 1.30), and mortality (OR 1.39; 95% CI 1.30 to 1.48). Correlation between O/E ratios for EMGS and ELGS were moderate to low (overall morbidity = 0.48, p < 0.0001; serious morbidity = 0.41, p < 0.0001, mortality = 0.18, p = 0.01). Outlier status was not consistent across EMGS and ELGS, with only slight agreement (overall morbidity = 0.18, p < 0.0001; serious morbidity = 0.16, p = 0.001, mortality = 0.19, p = 0.01). EMGS patients are at substantially greater risk than ELGS patients for adverse events. Hospitals do not appear to have highly consistent performance across EMGS and ELGS outcomes. Processes of care that afford improved outcomes to EMGS patients need to be identified and disseminated."

    "abstract": "The golden age of trauma has gone. 25 years ago the trauma surgeon was the life saver in the emergency department. He was the leader of the resuscitation team and made the important decisions in the process. Nowadays different factors have diminished the role of the trauma surgeon. Thanks to the decrease of severely injured patients in Europe and the advances in diagnostic and treatment possibilities the approach to trauma victims is less often operative. Furthermore, the uprising of emergency medicine specialists has taken many tasks out of the hands of the trauma surgeon. However, experienced trauma surgeons can do both critical care and acute care surgery and should be included in the decision-making process in the emergency room. Although the trauma surgeon often is no longer the captain of the ship in the emergency department, he can still play an important role in trauma care. They still are life savers."

    "abstract": "Critical care workforce analyses estimate a 35% shortage of intensivists by 2020 as a result of the aging population and the growing demand for greater utilization of intensivists. Surgical critical care in the U.S. is particularly challenged by a significant shortfall of surgical intensivists, with only 2586 surgeons currently certified in surgical critical care by the American Board of Surgery, and even fewer surgeons (1204) recertified in surgical critical care as of 2009. Surgical critical care fellows (160 in 2009) represent only 7.6% of all critical care trainees (2109 in 2009), with the largest number of critical care fellowship positions in internal medicine (1472, 69.8%). Traditional trauma fellowships have now transitioned into Surgical Critical Care or Acute Care Surgery (trauma, surgical critical care, emergency surgery) fellowships. Since adult critical care services are a large, expensive part of U.S. healthcare and workforce shortages continue to impact our healthcare system, recommendations for regionalization of critical care services in the U.S. is considered. The Critical Care Committee of the AAST has compiled national data regarding these important issues that face us in surgical critical care, trauma and acute care surgery, and discuss potential solutions for these issues."

    "abstract": "The 2010 Academic Emergency Medicine (AEM) consensus conference \"Beyond Regionalization\" aimed to place the design of a 21st century emergency care delivery system at the center of emergency medicine's (EM's) health policy research agenda. To examine the lessons learned from existing regional systems, consensus conference organizers convened a panel discussion made up of experts from the fields of acute care surgery, interventional cardiology, acute ischemic stroke, cardiac arrest, critical care medicine, pediatric EM, and medical toxicology. The organizers asked that each member provide insight into the barriers that slowed network creation and the solutions that allowed them to overcome barriers. For ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) management, the American Heart Association's (AHA's) Mission: Lifeline aims to increase compliance with existing guidelines through improvements in the chain of survival, including emergency medical services (EMS) protocols. Increasing use of therapeutic hypothermia post-cardiac arrest through a network of hospitals in Virginia has led to dramatic improvements in outcome. A regionalized network of acute stroke management in Cincinnati was discussed, in addition to the effect of pediatric referral centers on pediatric capabilities of surrounding facilities. The growing importance of telemedicine to a variety of emergencies, including trauma and critical care, was presented. Finally, the importance of establishing a robust reimbursement mechanism was illustrated by the threatened closure of poison control centers nationwide. The panel discussion added valuable insight into the possibilities of maximizing patient outcomes through regionalized systems of emergency care. A primary challenge remaining is for EM to help to integrate the existing and developing disease-based systems of care into a more comprehensive emergency care system."

    "abstract": "Acute care surgical teams are a new concept in the provision of emergency general surgery. Juggling emergency patients around the surgeons' and staffs' elective commitments resulted in semi-emergency procedures routinely being delayed. In an era of increasing financial pressure and the recent introduction of 'safe work hours' practices, the need for a new system which optimized available resources became apparent. At Fremantle Hospital we developed a new system in a concerted effort to minimize the waiting time for general surgical referrals in the Emergency Department, as well as to move semi-urgent operating from the afterhours to the daytime. To analyse the impact of the ASU, data were collected during February, March, and April 2009 and compared with data from the same period in 2008. Although most referrals were received afterhours, over 85% of operations were performed during working hours compared with 72% in the 2008 period. The time from referral to review decreased from an average of 3.2 h in 2008 to 2.1 h. The mean duration of stay in 2009 was 3 days, which was a reduction from 4.2 days in 2008. An increase in weekend discharge rates was seen after the introduction of the ASU. Despite an increased workload, more referrals were seen and more operations performed during working hours and the time from referral to review was reduced. Higher discharge rates and reduced length of stays increased the availability of beds. We have demonstrated a successful new model which continues to evolve."

Quality improvement methods that involve process redesign, such as “Lean,” appear to improve service reliability and efficiency in healthcare. Interrupted time series. The emergency general surgery ward of a university hospital in the United Kingdom. Seven safety relevant care processes. A Lean intervention targeting five of the seven care processes relevant to patient safety. 969 patients were admitted during the four month study period before the introduction of the Lean intervention (May to August 2007), and 1114 were admitted during the four month period after completion of the intervention (May to August 2008). Compliance with the five process measures targeted for Lean intervention (but not the two that were not) improved significantly (relative improvement 28% to 149%; P<0.007). Excellent compliance continued at least 10 months after active intervention ceased. The proportion of patients requiring transfer to other wards fell from 27% to 20% (P<0.000025). Rates of adverse events and potential adverse events were unchanged, except for a significant reduction in new safety events after transfer to other wards (P<0.028). Most adverse events and potential adverse events were owing to delays in investigation and treatment caused by factors outside the ward being evaluated. Lean can substantially and simultaneously improve compliance with a bundle of safety related processes. Given the interconnected nature of hospital care, this strategy might not translate into improvements in safety outcomes unless a system-wide approach is adopted to remove barriers to change."

    "abstract": "There is a national loss of access to surgeons for emergencies. Contributing factors include reduced numbers of practicing general surgeons, superspecialization, reimbursement issues, emphasis on work and life balance, and medical liability. Regionalizing acute care surgery (ACS), as exists for trauma care, represents a potential solution. The purpose of this study is to assess the financial and resources impact of transferring all nontrauma ACS cases from a community hospital (CH) to a trauma center (TC). We performed a case mix and financial analysis of patient records with ACS for a rural CH located near an urban Level I TC. ACS patients were analyzed for diagnosis, insurance status, procedures, and length of stay. We estimated physician reimbursement based on evaluation and management codes and procedural CPT codes. Hospital revenues were based on regional diagnosis-related group rates. All third-party remuneration was set at published Medicare rates; self-pay was set at nil. Nine hundred ninety patients were treated in the CH emergency department with 188 potential surgical diseases. ACS was necessary in 62 cases; 25.4% were uninsured. Extrapolated to 12 months, 248 patients would generate new TC physician revenue of >$155,000 and hospital profits of >$1.5 million. CH savings for call pay and other variable costs are >$100,000. TC operating room volume would only increase by 1%. Regionalization of ACS to TCs is a viable option from a business perspective. Access to care is preserved during an approaching crisis in emergency general surgical coverage. The referring hospital is relieved of an unfavorable payer mix and surgeon call problems. The TC receives a new revenue stream with limited impact on resources by absorbing these patients under its fixed costs, saving the CH variable costs."

A total of 402 appendicectomies were performed, 176 during the Trad period and 226 during the ACS period. There was no perioperative mortality. The complication rate was lower in the ACS period than the Trad period (9.3% v 17.0%; P = 0.02). After the intervention, there was no significant change in the time from presentation to arrival in theatre or in length of stay, but the proportion of operations performed at night (24:00-08:00) was reduced from 26.1% to 15.0% (P = 0.006). The proportion of negative appendicectomies was reduced from 22.7% to 17.3%, but the change was not statistically significant (P = 0.08). There was no difference in perforation rate before and after the intervention (13.6% v 13.3%; P = 0.86). The ACS model provides a safe surgical environment for patients and is associated with a reduced complication rate. Under the ACS model, there was an increase in the number of patients treated conservatively overnight, but this did not lead to an overall increase in perforation rate or length of stay."

Patient demographics, duration of symptoms, lab findings, computed tomography findings, and pathology were all analyzed. Over the 2-year period, 141 patients underwent urgent appendectomy. Ten patients (7.1%) were diagnosed with neoplasia on final pathology, including four women and six men with a mean age of 46.9 years and mean duration of symptoms of 12.6 days. Final pathology revealed four colonic adenocarcinoma; three mucinous tumors; one carcinoid; one endometrioma; and one patient had a combination of a mucinous cystadenoma, a carcinoid tumor, and endometriosis of the appendix. Six patients had concurrent appendicitis. Colonic and appendiceal neoplasia are not unusual etiologies of appendicitis. These patients tend to present at an older age and with longer duration of symptoms."

    "abstract": "Patients who undergo emergency operations represent a high-risk population and have been shown to have a high risk of poor outcomes. Little is known, however, about the variability in the quality of emergency general surgical care across hospitals or within hospitals across different procedures. The objectives of this study were to identify risk factors associated with adverse events, to compare 30-day outcomes after 3 common emergency general surgery procedures within and across hospitals, and thus, to determine whether the quality of emergency surgical care is procedure-dependent or intrinsic to other aspects of the hospital environment. Patients who underwent emergency appendectomy, cholecystectomy, or colorectal resection at 95 hospitals that submitted at least 20 of each procedure were identified in the 2005-2008 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project database. Outcomes of interest included 30-day overall morbidity and serious morbidity/mortality. Step-wise logistic regression generated patient-level predicted probabilities of an outcome. Based on the expected probabilities, observed to expected (O/E) ratios for each outcome, after each of the 3 procedures, were calculated for each hospital. Hospitals were divided into terciles based on O/E ratios. The agreement on hospital outcomes performance for overall morbidity and serious morbidity/mortality after appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and colorectal resection was assessed using weighted kappa statistics. Of the 30,788 appendectomies, 1,984 (6.44%) patients had any morbidity, and 1,140 (3.70%) patients had a serious morbidity or died. Of the 5,824 cholecystectomies, 503 (8.64%) patients had any morbidity, and 371 (6.37%) patients had a serious morbidity or died. Of the 8,990 colorectal resections, 4,202 (46.74%) patients had any morbidity, and 3,736 (41.56%) patients had a serious morbidity or died. For overall morbidity, O/E ratios for appendectomy ranged from 0.26 to 2.36; O/E ratios for cholecystectomy ranged from 0 to 3.04; O/E ratios for colorectal resection ranged from 0.45 to 1.51. For serious morbidity/mortality, O/E ratios for appendectomy ranged from 0.23 to 2.54; O/E ratios for cholecystectomy ranged from 0 to 4.28; O/E ratios for colorectal resection ranged from 0.59 to 1.75. Associations of risk-adjusted hospital outcomes based on tercile rank between procedures demonstrated slight but significant agreement for both overall morbidity (weighted kappa between 0.20 and 0.22) and serious morbidity/mortality (weighted kappa between 0.18 and 0.22). Despite this, 7 (7.4%) hospitals for overall morbidity and 9 (9.5%) hospitals for serious morbidity/mortality were rated in the highest (best) tercile for all procedures. Eight (8.4%) hospitals for overall morbidity and 8 (8.4%) hospitals for serious morbidity/mortality were rated in the lowest tercile for all procedures. Emergency general surgery procedures, particularly colorectal resections, were associated with substantial 30-day overall morbidity and serious morbidity/mortality. Most hospitals did not have consistent risk-adjusted outcomes across all 3 procedures, but for a substantive minority of institutions (7-10%), good or bad performance was generalizable across procedures. Individual hospitals should examine their procedure-specific outcomes after emergency general surgery operations to focus quality improvement initiatives appropriately."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare the management and outcome of acute cholecystitis in an acute care surgery (ACS) model to that of the traditional home-call attending surgeon. The ACS model is one in which a consultant led team manage all emergency surgical presentations. The consultant is involved with every decision made including theatre allocation. Records of all patients who underwent an emergency cholecystectomy in the 2 years before and after introduction of an ACS model were reviewed. A total of 202 patients were recruited into this study. The groups were matched for sex, age and insurance status. There was a decrease in the median time to theatre (1 versus 2 days) and total length of stay (4 versus 6 days) in the ACS group. There was no significant difference in the conversion rate between the groups. However, there was a decreased complication rate in the ACS group (8.7 versus 17.2%). There were no differences in the histological findings. Consultant presence in theatre was higher in the ACS group (73.9 versus 56.3%), and they were more often assisting (30.4 versus 4.6%). Results suggest that an ACS model is beneficial to patient care with shorter hospital stay and a decreased complication rate. This may reflects a greater input to patient assessment and management by the on-site consultant. In addition, the ACS model provides greater consultant supervision to the trainee."

This effort was divided into two parts: damage control and the management of the open abdomen. Only damage control is presented in this study. Part 1 is divided into indications for the open abdomen, temporary abdominal closure, staged abdominal repair, and nutrition support of the open abdomen. A literature review was performed for more than 30 years. Prospective and retrospective studies were included. The reviews and case reports were excluded. Of 1,200 articles, 95 were selected. Seventeen surgeons reviewed the articles with four defined criteria. The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma primer was used to grade the evidence. There was only one level I recommendation. A patient with documented abdominal compartment syndrome should undergo decompressive laparotomy. The open abdomen technique remains a heroic maneuver in the care of the critically ill trauma or surgical patient. For the best outcomes, a protocol for the indications, temporary abdominal closure, staged abdominal reconstruction, and nutrition support should be in place."

Career plans and perceptions about trauma surgery as a specialty. Of 6006 mailed surveys, we had a 20.1% response rate. Midlevel residents comprised most of the respondents, and most were undecided about their career choice or planned to enter general surgical private practice. The typical residency programs represented were academic (81.7%), urban (90.6%), and level I trauma centers (78.7%), and included more than 6 months of trauma experience (77.6%). Most respondents (70.6%) thought that trauma surgery was unappealing. The most important deterrents to entering the field were lifestyle, poor reimbursement, and limited operating room exposure, while increased surgical critical care was not seen as a restriction. When questioned about the future of trauma surgery, they believed that trauma surgeons should perform elective (86.8%) and nontrauma emergency (91.5%) cases and would benefit from active association with an outpatient clinic (76.0%). Intellectual challenge and exciting nature of the field were listed as the most appealing aspects, and ideal practice characteristics included guaranteed salary and time away from work. As demand for trauma surgeons increases, resident interest has dwindled. As a specialty, trauma surgery must undergo changes that reflect the needs of the incoming generation. We present a sampling of current surgical resident opinion and offer these data to assist the changing discipline and the evolving field of acute care surgery."

This study assesses the outcomes of a policy of same admission LC incorporated into a surgical training programme in a major teaching hospital. 447 index LCs performed over a 3-year period were reviewed retrospectively. The indications, operating surgeon, operating time, use of IOC, conversion rates, reasons for conversion and post-operative stay were analysed. Multivariate analysis of reasons for conversion was performed. 150 LCs were performed by consultants and 297 by registrars; 67 were performed by year 1-3 specialist registrars (SpR) and 230 by year 4-6 SpRs. The indications were biliary colic (n=7), acute cholecystitis (n=180), chronic cholecystitis (n=260), carcinoma (n=1). No difference was found in demographics, operating time (105 min Vs 115 min), use of IOC (34% Vs 29%; P=0.2) and post-operative stay (2 days Vs 1 day) between consultants and registrars. The conversion rates were higher for consultants compared to registrars (29 (19%) Vs 28 (9%), P=0.004). The overall conversion rate was 11%. There were no bile duct injuries. Predictors for conversion were CRP>50 at admission and acute cholecystitis. In a teaching hospital setting most acute admission LCs (66%) were performed by trainees. A step wise training programme with active consultant supervision of all index LCs results in low morbidity, low conversion rates, and a short post-operative stay for acute gallbladder disease. This model of same admission cholecystectomy provides a good training opportunity in emergency general surgery."

Our objective was to identify the demographics and spectrum of diseases in patients presenting with non-trauma surgical emergencies and the use of laparoscopy in emergent surgery in light of implementing an acute care surgery model. All non-trauma emergency surgical consultations at a large urban academic medical center from January 2005 to December 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. A clinician-completed registry was used to obtain patient information. Diagnoses were categorized into five broad groups for statistical analysis. Median age was 41 years (range, 6 weeks to 97 years), 50% were men, and the majority (67%) was Hispanic. The most common disease category was infectious followed by hepatobiliary. Prevalence of disease categories differed significantly among various racial groups. Majority (86%) of consult patients required admission. Thirty-eight percent of the consults resulted in an operative procedure, 40% of which were laparoscopic. The percentage of laparoscopic procedures increased during the 4-year study period. Patients with non-trauma surgical emergencies are young with a significantly wide range of diseases based on race. Less than half require emergent surgery. Laparoscopy is prevalent in emergency surgery and growing. Resources should be allocated to maximize the ability to treat infectious and hepatobiliary diseases, and to increase utilization of laparoscopy. The acute care surgeon needs to be proficient in laparoscopy."

    "abstract": "In July 2007, a large Canadian teaching hospital realigned its general surgery services into elective general surgery subspecialty-based services (SUBS) and a new urgent surgical care (USC) service (also know in the literature as an acute care surgery service). The residents on SUBS had their number of on-call days reduced to enable them to focus on activities related to SUBS. Our aim was to examine the effect of the creation of the USC service on the educational experiences of SUBS residents. We enrolled residents who were on SUBS for the 6 months before and after the introduction of the USC service. We collected data by use of a survey, WEBeVAL and recorded attendance at academic half days. Our 2 primary outcomes were residents' attendance at ambulatory clinics and compliance with the reduction in the number of on-call days. Our secondary outcomes included residents' time for independent study, attendance at academic half days, operative experience, attendance at multidisciplinary rounds and overall satisfaction with SUBS. Residents on SUBS had a decrease in the mean number of on-call days per resident per month from 6.28 to 1.84 (p = 0.006), an increase in mean attendance at academic half days from 65% to 87% (p = 0.028), at multidisciplinary rounds (p = 0.002) and at ambulatory clinics and an increase in independent reading time (p = 0.015), and they reported an improvement in their work environment. There was no change in the amount of time residents spent in the operating room or in their overall satisfaction with SUBS. Residents' education in the SUBS structure was positively affected by the creation of a USC service. Compliance with the readjustment of on-call duties was high and was identified as the single most significant factor in enabling residents to take full advantage of the unique educational opportunities available only while on SUBS. En juillet 2007, un grand centre hospitalier universitaire canadien a réorganisé ses services de chirurgie générale en les subdivisant en deux éléments : un service de chirurgie générale élective (SCGE) basé sur les surspécialités et un nouveau service de chirurgie d’urgence (SCU) (qui porte dans la littérature l’appellation de service de chirurgie de soins actifs). On a réduit le nombre de jours de garde des résidents assignés au SCGE afin de leur permettre de se consacrer aux activités de ce service. Notre but était de mesurer l’effet de la mise sur pied d’un SCU sur l’expérience d’ap-prentissage des résidents assignés au SCGE. Notre étude a porté sur les résidents assignés au SCGE pendant les six mois précédant et suivant la création du SCU. Nous avons recueilli les données au moyen du questionnaire WEB eVAL et nous avons enregistré les présences aux demi-journées de formation. Nos deux principaux paramètres étaient la participation des résidents aux cliniques ambulatoires et leur conformité à la réduction du nombre de leurs jours de garde. Nos paramètres secondaires incluaient le temps consacré par les résidents à la formation autonome, la participation aux demi-journées de formation, l’expérience chirurgicale, la participation aux tournées pluridisciplinaires et le degré général de satisfaction à l’endroit du SCGE. Chez les résidents assignés au SCGE, on a enregistré une baisse du nom-bre moyen de jours de garde par résident par mois, soit de 6,28 à 1,84 (p = 0,006), une augmentation de 65 % à 87 % de la participation moyenne aux demi-journées de formation (p = 0,028), aux tournées pluridisciplinaires (p = 0,002) et aux cliniques ambula-toires, de même qu’une augmentation du temps consacré à la formation autonome (p = 0,015); les résidents ont de plus fait mention d’une amélioration de leur environ-nement de travail. On n’a noté aucun changement quant au temps passé par les rési-dents au bloc opératoire ou quant à leur satisfaction globale à l’endroit du SCGE. La mise sur pied du SCU a exercé un effet positif sur les résidents assignés au SCGE. Leur conformité à la réorganisation des tâches de garde a été élevée et s’est révélée être le facteur le plus significatif leur ayant permis de profiter au maximum de l’expérience didactique unique offerte exclusivement au SCGE."

    "abstract": "Over the past 5 years, there has been a groundswell of support in Canada for the development of organized, focused and multidisciplinary approaches to caring for acutely ill general surgical patients. Newly forged acute care surgery (ACS) services are beginning to provide prompt, evidence-based and goal-directed care to acutely ill general surgical patients who often present with a diverse range of complex pathologies and little or no pre- or postoperative planning. Through a team-based structure with attention to processes of care and information sharing, ACS services are well positioned to improve outcomes, while finding and developing efficiencies and reducing costs of surgical and emergency health care delivery. The ACS model also offers enhanced opportunities for surgical education for students, residents and practicing surgeons, and it will provide avenues to strengthen clinical and academic bonds between the community and academic surgical centres. In the near future, cooperation of ACS services from community and academic hospitals across the country will lead to the formation of systems of acute surgical care whose development will be informed by rigorous data collection and research and evidence-based quality-improvement initiatives. In an era of increasing subspecialization, ACS is a strong unifying force in general surgery and a platform for collective advocacy for an important patient population."

Unfortunately, there is generally a paucity of exposure and information available to surgeons regarding this topic: obstetric training is rarely found in contemporary surgical residency curricula and is omitted nearly completely from general and acute care surgery literature and continuing medical education. The purpose of this manuscript is to serve as a topic specific review for surgeons and to present a surgeon oriented management algorithm. Medline and Ovid databases were utilized in a comprehensive literature review regarding the management of postpartum hemorrhage and a management algorithm for surgeons developed based upon a collaborative panel of general, acute care, trauma and obstetrical surgeons' review of the literature and expert opinion. A stepwise approach for surgeons of the medical and surgical interventions utilized to manage and treat postpartum hemorrhage is presented and organized into a basic algorithm. The manuscript should promote and facilitate a more educated, systematic and effective surgeon response and participation in the management of postpartum hemorrhage."

    "abstract": "To determine the financial consequences of a policy of admission first, followed by definitive investigation for patients with an admission diagnosis of suspected acute abdomen. Over a 1-month period, 122 patients were admitted with a suspected surgical diagnosis of acute abdomen (55 men, 67 women); age range 16-95 years (median: 56.5). Based on surgical operation required (n = 36), death after admission (n = 6, three postoperative deaths) and/or severe surgical illness (n = 17), 56 required surgical inpatient admission, while 66 did not. The patients who did not require admission spent significantly shorter time in hospital than those who required admission (median: 5 days vs. 8.5 days; p = 0.0000). Total hospital hotel and investigation cost (not including ITU or theatre costs) for all 122 patients was 330,468 pounds. Overall, 205,468 pounds was consumed by these 56 patients who required admission, while 125,000 pounds was spent on 66 patients whose clinical course did not justify admission; 92% of which was spent on hospital hotel costs and 8% on the cost of imaging and/or endoscopy. On a national basis, emergency General Surgery admissions account for 1000 Finished Consultant Episodes per 100,000 population. The findings of this study suggest that this equates to a national NHS spend of 650 million pounds each year, for the hotel costs of patients that could arguably avoid surgical admission altogether. Continuing to admit patients with a suspected acute abdomen first and then requesting definitive investigation makes neither clinical nor economic sense."

    "abstract": "As the aging population continues to increase, the surgical needs of the elderly will increase. The acute care surgery model has been developed in which the trauma team also manages all general surgical emergencies to improve patient outcomes. We retrospectively reviewed our elderly acute care surgery population during the past 5 years to determine the variables affecting major abdominal surgery outcomes. Patients aged 80 years and older who received an emergent major abdominal operation by our Acute Care Surgery team between July 2000 and November 2006 were included. We assessed after-hours operations, length of stay, duration of operation, gender, comorbidities, and mortality. Administrative, operating room, and corporate databases were used for demographics, comorbidities, admission logistics, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, and mortality. We performed SPSS, chi2, and logistic regression analyses. A total of 183 operations were performed with a mortality of 15%. Significant predictors were ASA score and female gender, with increasing ASA scores leading to worse outcomes and women faring worse than men as an independent variable. Neither operative duration nor off-hours surgery was associated with increased mortality. This is the first study to report mortality data and expected survival curves for major abdominal surgery in the octogenarian population. Our data prove that it is safer than previously thought to operate on the elderly. Our mortality data and survival curves provide real data for the surgeon to be able to risk stratify and discuss predicted outcomes with consultants, patients, and families."

    "abstract": "Emergent operation after renal transplantation (RT) has traditionally been associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. We reviewed 2340 adult patients who underwent RT at our tertiary care center and identified 55 patients who required acute care surgical consultation within 1 year of transplantation. Of these, 43 were treated operatively and 12 nonoperatively. Primary diagnoses were intestinal problems in 29 patients (53%), including diverticulitis, ischemia, perforation, obstruction, and bleeding; cholecystitis in 10 (18%); fluid collections in six (11%), appendicitis and hernias in two each (4%); gastritis in one (2%); and no diagnosis in five (9%). Colonic pathology was treated with resection and diversion in 14 of 16 patients who underwent surgery. Acute allograft rejection preceded the surgical problem in five patients. Complications occurred in 13 per cent of patients, and mortality was 9 per cent. Colonic ischemia had a fulminating presentation and particular morbidity. We conclude that acute gastrointestinal emergencies after RT are rare and that early and aggressive intervention using an acute care surgical model yields excellent results."

    "abstract": "In July 2007, we introduced an acute care surgery service to an academic department of surgery staffed in a prearranged, dedicated rotation by critical care-trained surgeons to address all emergency department, inpatient, and transfer consultations. This study is designed to evaluate the impact on patient care and describe the case-mix experienced. A retrospective review was done of a prospectively collected database encompassing all patients evaluated. Diagnosis, operations performed, and times of operations were recorded. Eight hundred sixty-one patients were evaluated. Four hundred ten patients (47.6%) had 500 operations; 368 (72.8%) were performed in the operating room and 132 (26.2%) at the bedside. Respiratory failure and malnutrition (n = 130), soft-tissue infection (n = 115), abdominal pain (n = 97), biliary (n = 94), bowel obstruction (n = 78), diseases of the colon (n = 49), and appendicitis (n = 46) were the most common diseases seen. The most common operations performed included incision and drainage (n = 61); tracheostomy or percutaneous gastrostomy, or both (n = 125); cholecystectomy (n = 53); appendectomy (n = 41); colectomy (n = 34); and complex abdominal wound care (n = 43). In the year before implementation, 55.4% of emergent procedures were performed between 7:30 am and 5:30 pm, compared with 70% after implementation (p = 0.0002). Procedures performed after 5:30 pm decreased from 44.6% to 30%. Implementation of an acute care surgery service has been positive in terms of facilitating the ability to provide more timely care by increasingly using the daytime operating room and providing a breadth of consultative and operative experience to the participating academic surgeons and trainees."

We hypothesize that EGS patient outcomes would not differ by provider on a service driven by evidence-based medicine (EBM) protocols. Retrospective study of prospectively collected EGS repository. academic level I trauma center, and regional EGS referral center from 2003 to 2007. There were 14 faculty and seven fellows during the study period. EGS coverage is a full week, with weeknight coverage by the in-house trauma/EGS faculty. Fellows are mentored by designated faculty while on service, who discuss patients, assist in the OR, or assume care if necessary. Data collected included age, gender, LOS, ICU LOS, ventilator days, disposition (home/rehab), and infectious complications(IC) (VAP, BSI, UTI, SSI). Primary outcome was mortality. 1769 patients met study criteria. The mean age was 47.1 (+/-18), 47% were males. The average ICU LOS was 2.9 d (+/-7.9), ventilator d 2.6 (+/-7.6); 82.1% were discharged home and 13.7% were referred to rehab. There was no statistical difference in mortality, LOS, ICU LOS, disposition, ventilator d, and IC between faculty and fellow providers. An EGS service with EBM protocols assures consistency in patient outcomes independent of provider level: faculty or fellows. Our model for mentoring fellows did not decrease EGS patient outcomes."

We sought to determine the impact of delayed transfer from the ED on outcomes in trauma/emergency general surgical patients in a center that has developed a policy to triage more critically ill/severely injured patients to earlier ICU admission. All trauma patients admitted from January 2005 to April 2007 in a Level I trauma center were divided into a nondelayed (<or=6 hours) group or a delayed (>6 hours) group. Factors associated with their injuries and outcomes were determined from a large prospective database and all deaths were examined by root-cause analysis. Sentinel events were examined in all deaths and among randomly selected survivors. Among 3,918 patients, ED stay was often prolonged. The nondelayed group spent a mean of 3 hours in the ED compared with 14.6 hours in the delayed group. Patients admitted earlier were more seriously injured and had markedly worse outcomes, with overall mortality of 18% versus 2.3% in the nondelayed and delayed group, respectively. Mortality did not increase with time spent in the ED but, in fact, decreased after 4 hours. Case analysis disclosed two deaths that might have been altered by earlier ICU transfer. Experienced clinicians can effectively triage more critically injured patients to earlier ICU admission and alter associations between ED length of stay and mortality. Hospitals with a large trauma/emergency general surgery caseload resulting in delays in ED throughput should institute policies and procedures for triage of more severely injured patients for early ICU admission and develop a monitoring system to ensure that delays do not adversely affect patient outcomes."

A total of 369 patients who underwent diathermy incision (group A: 185 patients) or scalpel incision (group B: 184 patients) were analyzed. Variables analyzed were: surgical wound classification, length and depth of incision, incision time, duration of operation, incisional blood loss, postoperative pain, duration of hospital stay, duration of healing, and postoperative complications. The inclusion criteria were all patients who underwent elective or emergency general surgery. The exclusion criteria were only cases with incomplete patients' data and patients who were lost to follow-up. This study was conducted at Fatima Hospital-Baqai Medical University and Shamsi Hospital (Karachi), from January 2006 to December 2007. Incision time was significantly longer for patients in group B (p = 0.001). Incisional blood loss also was more for patients in group B (p = 0.000). Pain perception was found to be markedly reduced during the first 48 h in group A (p = 0.000). Total period of hospital stay (p = 0.129) and time for complete wound healing (p = 0.683) were almost the same for both groups. Postoperative complication rate by wound classification did not differ markedly between the two groups (p = 0.002 vs. p = 0.000). Diathermy incision has significant advantages compared with the scalpel because of reduced incision time, less blood loss, & reduced early postoperative pain."

    "abstract": "Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is a harbinger of intra-abdominal mischief, and its measurement is cheap, simple to perform, and reproducible. Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH), especially grades 3 and 4 (IAP > 18 mmHg), occurs in over a third of patients and is associated with an increase in intra-abdominal sepsis, bleeding, renal failure, and death. Increased IAP reading may provide an objective bedside stimulus for surgeons to expedite diagnostic and therapeutic work-up of critically ill patients. One of the greatest challenges surgeons and intensivists face worldwide is lack of recognition of the known association between IAH, ACS, and intra-abdominal sepsis. This lack of awareness of IAH and its progression to ACS may delay timely intervention and contribute to excessive patient resuscitation. All patients entering the intensive care unit (ICU) after emergency general surgery or massive fluid resuscitation should have an IAP measurement performed every 6 h. Each ICU should have guidelines relating to techniques of IAP measurement and an algorithm for management of IAH."

    "abstract": "Until about two decades ago, the provision of emergency surgery was implicitly linked to all aspects of surgical care in all surgical specialties. While this remains true in the smaller surgical specialties, in the larger specialties the development of subspecialisation has eroded the comprehensive nature of acute care provision. In general surgery, the numerically largest of the nine surgical specialties, the greatest challenges in provision of acute care exist. Availability of appropriately trained general surgeons to deliver generic acute and trauma care has reached crisis point. An attempt is being made in the Western World to remedy these problems. Recognising that it is increasingly difficult to span the knowledge and skill mix necessary to manage all aspects of acute care in general surgery as well as a subspecialty practice, the concept of acute care surgery has been born. To look at the status of acute care surgery in Australia and New Zealand, we conducted a PubMed search on all articles matching the words emergency, acute care, and general surgery, and reviewed any papers relevant to Australasia. Of the 270 papers found, 4 papers were relevant to Australia and New Zealand. These studies outline the advantages of an acute care model in dealing with emergency surgery and delineate few disadvantages. Whether a new training paradigm, \"acute care surgery\" will benefit patients, the health services, and the surgeons in New Zealand and elsewhere remains to be seen. Allowing the current trend towards inadequate numbers and training of surgeons to deliver acute care to continue is unacceptable."

    "abstract": "The specialties dealing with emergency medicine and emergency surgery are in need for a new roadmap. While the medical and surgical management of emergency conditions very often go hand-in-hand, issues relating to emergency and trauma surgery have particular concerns, which are global in magnitude. Obviously, choosing a career dealing (solely) with emergencies and trauma is associated with concerns related to lifestyle issues and, for surgeons, maintenance of adequate operative experience with the increased non-operative management. Also, dealing with patients' whose outcome may be dismal with high associated morbidity and mortality is often not viewed as rewarding. The global flux of medical students away from general surgical training and trauma surgery in particular is an example of how recruitment to specialties dealing with uncomfortable, unpredictable, and \"out-of-office-hours\" work may be in dire straits. How surgeons around the world will deal with this challenge will likely be diverse and tailored according to the needs of any given region, be it North America, Europe, or Scandinavia. However, refurnishing the training in General Surgery in order to ensure proper care for acute surgical illness and trauma appears mandated in order to keep in line with the centennial words of Halstead that \"every important hospital should have on its resident staff of surgeons at least one who is well and able to deal with any emergency that may arise\"."

Countries with ties to the Austro-German surgical tradition had higher scores both in trauma system development (p = 0.003) and in trauma surgery specialization (p = 0.000), whereas the size, economic performance or geographical location were not associated with either. Despite the great variation from country to country, three trends in developing trauma care and education can be identified: trauma system development based exclusively on major (life-threatening) trauma care (the old United States model), combining trauma and emergency surgery into a single regionalized system (the acute care surgery model), or maintaining the orthopedic surgery-orientated all-inclusive trauma care model as practiced in most central European countries today. Although each country and region might proceed along their own line depending on local circumstances, some kind of general guidelines and recommendations at least at the European Union level would be urgently needed."

    "abstract": "Norwegian surgeons provide for a wide range of modern surgical services with excellent results. With a thriving economy and a high standard of living and education, the major disease spectrum relates to cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Almost all types of surgery are performed in Norway. Improvements have been achieved through national programs and population-based registries have served as instrumental tools (eg, for cancer surgery). About 1 in every 5 general surgeons holds a PhD degree, with an even greater number for some subspecialties (30%-40% have PhD degrees). Trauma and acute care surgery is not a formal specialty, but a formal trauma system is likely to be established in the near future. Ring-fencing of elective surgical tasks from emergency surgery is increasingly being performed in surgical departments. Governmental coverage (85% of health care costs) and equal access to care have created waiting lists and given rise to private surgical outpatient clinics. The increase of women in medical school (>60%) has yet to be paralleled in most surgical specialists (eg, about 10% of general surgeons are women). Subspecialization, the 40-hour workweek, technical improvements (interventional and minimally invasive procedures), and quality demands have changed the surgical work scenario for both junior and senior staff members. Formal requirements in training duration and educational content are likely to change. Recruitment to surgery and ensuring continuity of patient care take surgery in Norway beyond the scalpel into the 21st century."

    "abstract": "The open abdomen after severe intra-abdominal trauma and emergency surgery is a major operative challenge. It is associated with high morbidity and prolonged hospital stays. Several management strategies have been developed to assist with fascial closure but no single method has emerged as the best. The Wittmann Patch (Starsurgical, Burlington, WI) is a unique device which uses velcro to permit progressive abdominal closure without necessitating serial operations. The purpose of this study was to determine the fascial closure rate using the Wittmann patch. We hypothesized that use of the patch would result in a high closure rate. Hospital billing codes were reviewed to identify those patients who underwent Wittmann patch placement. During the period from June 2002 to May of 2006, 29 patients were identified. These included 19 trauma patients and 10 other surgical patients. Other patients included vascular, bariatric, and emergency general surgery patients. The trauma registry and the patients' medical records were reviewed to determine injury severity, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores, fluid requirements, patch placement, management, and patient outcomes. Twenty-two (76%) of the 29 patients survived to discharge. The average Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was 25 +/- 6 in all patients, 22.9 +/- 6 in survivors, and 31 +/- 3 in those who died (p = 0.004). Mean injury severity scale and abdominal abbreviated injury scale scores in trauma patients were 28 +/- 10 and 3 +/- 2, respectively. The mean volume of fluid given during the 24 hours before having an open abdomen or patch placement was 17.6 L +/- 10.1 L. Twenty-five (86.2%) of 29 patients had at least one abdominal operation before placement of the patch (mean 1.3 +/- 1.0). Eighteen (82%) of 22 patients who survived to discharge had successful facial closure. Three patients (14%) required mesh placement for abdominal closure. The remaining patient had his patch removed and ultimately underwent skin grafting and subsequent component separation closure. Successful fascial closure was achieved after 15.5 days +/- 10.2 days (range, 5-42 days). The skin was left open in half of the patients. There were four abdominal complications that were noted while the patch was in place. Three of four complications were related to the primary disease, and in the fourth complication the patch became infected and had to be removed. There were no eviscerations or enterocutaneous fistulas after primary fascial closure. The median length of stay was 28 days (Interquartile range, 14-39 days). Use of the Wittmann Patch can achieve a high rate of delayed fascial closure in severe trauma and critically ill emergency surgery patients with open abdomens. Most of the complications associated with use of the patch were wound infections after fascial closure and closure of the skin."

Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for the primary outcome measure of death. Fifty-two patients met the inclusion criteria, with five deaths (9.6%). The median time to the operating room (OR) was 8.6 h. The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, serum lactic acid concentration, and intensive care unit length of stay were significantly different for non-survivors. The APACHE II score was an independent predictor of death when controlling for age and time to OR. An EGS service was associated with shorter time to OR, which may improve the outcome. Physiologic derangement, as estimated by the APACHE II score, is predictive of death from nSSTI."

Much attention has focused on the operative workload of trauma surgeons as it is critical in both maintaining operative skills and promoting the interest of surgical residents in trauma careers. We examined the operative experience of our surgical service which includes trauma, emergency general surgery, and elective general surgery to analyze changes occurring over the past decade. A retrospective study was performed by extracting data from the operative database at our Level I trauma center from January 1995 to December 2005. The cases were classified as trauma, emergency general surgery, or elective general surgery. Data were analyzed using weighted linear regression to analyze statistical significance. Although the total number of cases performed by the trauma service remained constant, the proportion of initial operative trauma cases (<24 hours from arrival to operation) decreased from 14% to 8% (r2 = 0.91, p < 0.001) over the study period. In contrast, emergency general surgery cases increased over this time period (r2 = 0.57, p < 0.01). Elective case volume was unchanged. The majority of the waning of trauma cases was due to decreased surgery on the liver and spleen and fewer neck explorations. Trauma operative experience decreased but emergency general surgery increased over a decade at our trauma center. It appears possible to maintain a busy operative trauma service by the inclusion of emergency general surgery consultations."

Still, early and accurate diagnosis of this condition remains a dilemma and is particularly challenging in critically ill patients. This review examines recent literature regarding optimal timing of operation for common acute gastrointestinal conditions. No conclusive evidence exists to guide surgeons in the decision of when to operate on common gastrointestinal problems. Recent data support changes in traditional views of treating these conditions: the debate surrounding emergent appendectomy for acute appendicitis is more active than ever, but interval appendectomy appears to be unnecessary in asymptomatic patients, laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis is safe, regardless of the duration of symptoms; sigmoid colectomy for acute diverticulitis is no longer required after two episodes; and surgeon experience with developing diagnostic and therapeutic technologies continues to evolve. A combination of physical findings, laboratory data, and directed imaging studies help establish a diagnosis and predict the benefit of surgical intervention in common acute abdominal problems. Advanced imaging technology and critical care support have facilitated changes in operative timing in acute care surgery."

All patients admitted through the emergency department of a Level I trauma center who underwent appendectomies between March 2005 and May 2006 (Trauma period) were identified. During this period, the trauma service covered most surgical emergencies. Comparison was made with the earlier 15-month period (Pretrauma). Emergency department to operating room (OR) time, procedure length, and negative appendectomy rates were obtained. In the Pretrauma period, 273 patients underwent appendectomy, compared with 279 in the Trauma period. Two-thirds (66%) of appendectomies in the Trauma period were performed by trauma surgeons. There was no difference in both periods with regard to mean emergency department to OR time (10.5 hours versus 9.9 hours; p = 0.4509), perforation rates (12% Pretrauma versus 7.5% Trauma; p = 0.1134), or negative appendectomy rates (17.9% Pretrauma versus 18.2% Trauma; p = 1.0). In the Trauma period, more appendectomies were completed laparoscopically (84.6% Trauma versus 66.6% Pretrauma; p < 0.0001), and mean OR time was shorter (57.4 minutes versus 67 minutes; p = 0.0006). In comparing two periods with and without the trauma service coverage of surgical emergencies, no difference was found in emergency department to OR time, perforation rates, or negative appendectomy rates in the management of acute appendicitis. There was a decrease in operative time and an increase in the proportion of laparoscopic appendectomies in the Trauma period. Trauma services can effectively incorporate emergency surgical coverage of procedures, such as appendectomies, without compromising timely intervention."

As we envision this new paradigm of surgical practice, an evaluation of our current status across the nation's trauma centers is an essential step. The purpose of this study is to determine the practice patterns of trauma surgeons at major trauma centers throughout the United States. A survey was sent to the trauma directors of the 1,288 designated trauma centers in the United States, as listed by the American Trauma Society. As proposed, acute care surgery would encompass performing emergent abdominal, vascular, and thoracic trauma procedures as well as providing critical care. The addition of simple orthopedic and neurosurgical procedures has been considered. The survey response rate was 72% among the Level I/II/III centers (n = 515) with 92% of Level I, 72% of Level II, and 59% of Level III centers responding. Of the 169 Level I centers, 31 (18%) reported their trauma surgeons perform the full complement of thoracic, vascular, and abdominal cases. Trauma surgeons managed the full range of injuries at 11 (6%) of the 187 Level II centers and 7 (4%) of the 159 Level III centers. At these 49 centers, only 41% of surgeons perform elective thoracic and vascular cases. The remaining 466 centers enlist a combination of vascular and thoracic surgeons to manage trauma patients. Finally, trauma surgeons performed cranial burr holes at eight trauma centers, placement of ICP monitors at four, and open fracture washout at three trauma centers. The model of the acute care surgeon is attractive and timely, but only a limited number of trauma surgeons currently practice this proposed range of operative procedures; even fewer surgeons have an elective surgical practice to maintain key operative skills. Fellowship training programs need to incorporate vascular and thoracic procedures to enable the specialty of acute care surgery."

In some central European countries, specialists qualify in general and orthopedic trauma surgery; these all rounders also perform life-saving thoracic and neurosurgical procedures, such as emergency thoracotomies and craniotomies. The European model is not a uniform system for acute surgical care."

    "abstract": "Trauma surgery has changed significantly over the past decade. Nonoperative evidence-based algorithms have become common and surgical trauma volume has become increasingly difficult to maintain. The acute care surgery (ACS) model, which integrates trauma, critical care, and emergency surgery, has been proposed as a future model of trauma practice. Database information from an academic, county-based, trauma center was reviewed. A performance improvement surgical procedure database and level I trauma registry from 2005 were used to evaluate one center's ACS practice. There were 2,276 cases performed by 7 full-time and 5 part-time surgeons. Elective cases accounted for 64% (1,480) of caseload, emergency/urgent general surgery accounted for 32% (719) of cases, and emergency trauma surgeries accounted for 4% (96 procedures in 77 patients). In all, 23% were performed after hours. The ACS model supported controllable hours, adequate surgical volume, excellent patient care, and an appealing clinical practice. Surgical practice in a county-run trauma hospital can be similar to the ACS model, with positive results in terms of clinical volume and physician satisfaction. As clinical practices shift to the ACS model, there are lessons to be learned from currently existing, thriving, long-standing similar prototypes."

    "title": "Should the trauma surgeon do the emergency surgery?",
    "abstract": "The specialty of trauma surgery is evolving. The continued decline in general surgery operative interventions in trauma patients has led to an exodus of promising young surgeons away from the field. A concurrent decline in the number of burn surgeons, as well as orthopedists and neurosurgeons interested in providing emergency care, led to a pressing need for surgeons able to perform emergency surgical care. In addition, the general surgery workforce has followed a trend of increased specialization, with young surgeons gravitating toward specialties that are perceived to have a more forgiving lifestyle. This development has led to troublesome gaps in the emergency surgery call schedule at many institutions. Several intrepid centers already have begun assimilating acute care surgery into their departments with impressive results for their patients. Increased operative volume, increased reimbursements, and a palatable lifestyle add to the allure of treating these complex and interesting patients. Training future surgeons to staff the ranks of acute care surgery is an important and exciting challenge. It may be that \"Should the trauma surgeon do the emergency surgery?\" is the wrong question. A better question may be \"How best can we train surgeons for this new specialty\"?"

    "abstract": "A damage control (DC) approach was developed to improve survival in severely injured trauma patients. The role of DC in acute surgery (AS) patients who are critically ill, as a result of sepsis or overwhelming haemorrhage continues to evolve. The goal of this study was to assess morbidity and mortality of AS patients who underwent DC, and to compare observed and predicted morbidity and mortality as calculated from APACHE II and physiological and operative severity score for the enumeration of mortality and morbidity (POSSUM) scores. Consecutive acute surgery patients who underwent DC from 2002 to 2004 were included. Retrospectively collected data included patient demographics, physiological parameters, surgical indications and procedures, mortality, morbidity, as well as volumes of crystalloid and colloid (plasma and red blood cell) resuscitation. Observed mortality and complications were compared to those calculated from APACHE II and POSSUM scores. Data were analysed using the Mann-Whitney test for median values, chi-square and Fisher's exact tests for proportions. Sixteen patients (mean age 53 years, seven men, nine women) underwent DC. The most common indications for DC included abdominal sepsis (6/15), intraoperative bleeding (5/15), and bowel ischaemia (3/15). The mean intraoperative blood loss during the index procedure was 2060mL. There were 2.4 average procedures per patient. At the end of DC II (36.5h), mean infusion of crystalloid was 17L, packed red blood cells was 3.6L, and plasma was 3L. Eight of 16 patients required vasopressor administration during resuscitation. At 28 days, there were five unexpected survivors as predicted by POSSUM and three by APACHE II (observed mortality seven, predicted mortality by the two methods: 12 (P=0.074), and 10 (P=0.24), respectively). Five patients died prior to definitive abdominal closure. Split thickness skin grafting (4/16) and primary fascial closure (4/16) constituted the most common methods of abdominal closure. Surgical morbidity predicted by POSSUM (98%) and actual morbidity (100%) were similar. Although the morbidity and mortality of AS patients undergoing DC is high, the application of DC principles in this group may reduce mortality compared to that predicted by POSSUM or APACHE II. In order to adequately demonstrate this contention, large, multi-institutional studies of DC in AS patients need to be performed. The POSSUM score appears to accurately estimate the high morbidity in general surgery DC patients, and supports the importance of team management of these complex patients by acute care surgery specialists."

    "abstract": "In the new era of resident work hour restrictions and an emphasis on minimally invasive surgery, experience in performing open biliary surgery is diminishing. We sought to review our resident operative experience to determine if it appears adequate for a well-trained general surgeon. The case logs of the General Surgery, Oncology, and Trauma/Emergency General Surgery (EGS) services were reviewed for a 1-year period. All biliary procedures that included the potential for gallbladder or bile duct surgery were reviewed. We performed 745 laparoscopic cholecystectomies last year on our General Surgery, Oncology, and Trauma/EGS services. Conversion to open procedure was 4.5% (16/364) on our elective services and 6% (23/381) on our Trauma/EGS services. Effective clearance of common bile duct stones performed retrograde by endoscopy and transhepatically by interventional radiology limited our residents' experience performing common bile duct surgery for stones to 13 performed laparoscopically and 10 performed open. Other operations that included open cholecystectomies and common bile duct procedures were pancreatico-duodenectomy (87), biliary bypass (22), biliary resection/reconstruction (20), hepatic lobectomy (48), sphincteroplasty and ampullectomy (6). The small number of conversions from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomies and the few common bile duct explorations performed for stone disease would be inadequate to train our six categorical surgical residents to perform open cholecystectomies and common bile duct procedures without a training program that augments this by providing a strong hepato-biliary-pancreatic experience. Programs without a strong hepato-biliary-pancreatic program should review their residents' operative experience."

A MEDLINE literature search was supplemented with local experience and national presentations at major meetings to provide data for this review. Considerations including faculty complement, service structure, resident staffing, physician extenders, the decreased role of community hospitals in providing trauma and emergency general surgery care, and the effects on an elective operative schedule are inadequately explored at present. There are no firm recommendations as to how to incorporate emergency general surgery into a trauma/critical care practice that will satisfy both academic and community practice paradigms. The near future seems likely to embrace the expanded training and clinical care program termed acute care surgery. A host of essential elements have yet to be examined to undertake a critical analysis of the applicability, advisability, and appropriate structure of both emergency general surgery and acute care surgery in the United States. Proceeding along this pathway may be fraught with training, education, and implementation pitfalls that are ideally addressed before deploying acute care surgery as a national standard."

Acute care surgery (ACS, a combination of trauma surgery, emergency surgery, and surgical critical care) has been proposed as a practice model for the future of general surgery. To date, there are few data regarding outcomes of surgical emergencies in the ACS model. Between September 1999 and August 2002, surgical emergencies were staffed at the faculty level by either an in-house trauma/emergency surgeon (ACS model) or a non-trauma general surgeon taking home call (traditional [TRAD] model). Coverage alternated monthly. Other aspects of hospital care, including resident complement, remained unchanged. We retrospectively reviewed key time intervals (emergency department [ED] presentation to surgical consultation; surgical consultation to operation [OR]; and ED presentation to OR) and outcomes (rupture rate, negative appendectomy rate, complication rate, and hospital length of stay [LOS]) for patients treated in the ACS and TRAD models. Questions of interest were examined using chi tests for discrete variables and independent sample t test for comparison of means. During the study period, 294 appendectomies were performed. In-house ACS surgeons performed 167 procedures, and the home-call TRAD surgeons performed 127 procedures. No difference was found in the time from ED presentation to surgical consultation; however, the time interval from consultation to OR was significantly decreased in the ACS model (TRAD 7.6 hours vs. ACS 3.5 hours, P < 0.05). As a result, the total time from ED presentation to OR was significantly shorter in the ACS model (TRAD 14.0 hours vs. ACS 10.1 hour, P < 0.05). Rupture rates were decreased in the ACS model (TRAD 23.3% vs. ACS 12.3%, P < 0.05); negative appendectomy rates were similar. The complication rate in the ACS model was decreased (TRAD 17.4% vs. ACS 7.7%, P < 0.05), as was the hospital LOS (TRAD 3.5 days vs. ACS 2.3 days, P < 0.001). In patients with acute appendicitis, the presence of an in-house acute care surgeon significantly decreased the time to operation, rupture rate, complication rate, and hospital length of stay. The ACS model appears to improve outcomes of acute appendicitis compared with a TRAD home-call model. This study supports the efficacy and efficiency of the ACS model in the management of surgical emergencies."

The Education Committee of the Surgery Section of the Society of Critical Care Medicine sent surveys by e-mail to all SCC program directors. The survey included questions regarding the content of the fellowship, specifically, subspecialty rotations, trauma content, and operative experience. If they offered a trauma fellowship, the survey queried its structure also. A total of 39 of 82 surveys were returned. About one third of the programs have only SCC fellowships, one third combine SCC/trauma in 1-yr programs, and the remainder combine SCC/trauma in 2 yrs. Of the programs, 79% provided operative experience: 15% on a separate rotation and 39% on call during intensive care unit coverage. About half of the operative experiences were related to trauma and one quarter to emergency general surgery. The great majority of rotations were in general surgical or trauma intensive care units. SCC programs already include meaningful trauma and emergency general surgery operative experience. Surgical subspecialty intensive care unit and operative rotations may contribute to optimal training of the \"acute care surgeon.\""

    "abstract": "The case-management team (CMT) has been an effective tool to decrease denied days and improve hospital throughput on a trauma service. With the addition of emergency general surgery (EGS) to our practice, we reviewed the ability of the case management team to absorb EGS patients on the inpatient trauma service while maintaining the improvements initially realized. An interdisciplinary CMT was implemented in January 1999. CRNPs were added in August 2003 to address the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education resident work-hour restrictions. \"Key communications\" for each CMT member are reported three times per week as defined by a hospital-approved policy. Beginning in August 2001, the trauma service was expanded to include EGS patients. Data from the trauma registry, hospital utilization review, and finance office were analyzed before (1998 and 1999) and after (2003 and 2004) the addition of EGS. Tests of proportion were used to evaluate questions of interest. The number of injured patients admitted to the trauma service remained relatively constant during the study periods, ranging from a high of 1,365 in 1999 to a low of 1,116 in 2003. Beginning in 2003, the influx of emergency surgery patients to the service was marked. By 2004, there were 561 emergency surgery admissions, representing more than 30% of the total service admissions. As a result, the total number of service admissions has dramatically increased, reaching 1,833 in CY 2004, a 56% increase from CY 1998 levels. Hospital length of stay data varied from a low of 5.5 days in CY 1999 to a high of 6.9 days in CY 2003. Length of stay appeared to be associated with injury severity (mean Injury Severity Score 11.8 in 1999 and 13.1 in 2003) and case mix, but not associated with denied days. The percent of denied days decreased over the study periods, from 4.6% in 1998 (before the implementation of the CMT) to 0.5% in 2004 (p<0.01). The percent of readmissions also fell significantly over the study periods (4.0% in 1998 to 1.8% in 2004; p<0.01). The initial improvements in patient throughput noted after the introduction of a CMT in January 1999 have been maintained in recent years despite the addition of an EGS component to the trauma service. Percent denied days and readmissions have continued to decrease. The length of stay for these patients remains, in part, dependent on other factors. The CMT plays an integral role in maintaining the efficiency of a trauma/emergency surgery service."

Attending surgeon work-hours have not been similarly reduced, and many trauma services have added emergency general surgery responsibilities. We hypothesized that trauma attending/resident work-hour disparity may disincentivize residents from selecting trauma careers and that trauma directors would view ACGME regulations negatively. We conducted a 6-month study of resident and in-house trauma attending self-reported hours at a level I trauma center and sent a questionnaire to 172 national level I trauma directors (TDs) regarding work-hours restrictions. TD survey response rate was 48 per cent; 100 per cent of 15 residents and 6 trauma faculty completed work-hour logs. Attending mean hours (87.1/ wk), monthly calls (5), and shifts > 30 hours exceeded that of all resident groups. Case volume was similar. Residents viewed their lifestyle more favorably than the lifestyle of the trauma attending (Likert score 3.6 +/- 0.5 vs Likert score 2.5 +/- 0.8, P = 0.0003). Seventy-one per cent cited attending work hours and lifestyle as a reason not to pursue a trauma career. Nationally, 80 per cent of trauma surgeons cover emergency general surgery; 40 per cent work greater than 80 hours weekly, compared with < 1 per cent of surgical trainees (P < 0.0001). Most TDs feel that residents do not spend more time reading (89%) or operating (96%); 68 per cent feel patient care has suffered as a result of duty-hours restrictions. Seventy-one per cent feel residents will not select trauma surgery as a career as a result of changes in duty hours. Perceived trauma attending/ resident work-hour disparity may disincentive trainees from trauma career selection. TDs view resident duty-hour restrictions negatively."

We hypothesize a BSL protocol would maintain patient safety while reducing OR use. Patients were prospectively entered into a BSL protocol from July 2002 to June 2003 and retrospectively reviewed. Protocol indications for BSL were abdominal compartment syndrome, decompensation due to hemorrhage, washout/closure, and sepsis in a patient too unstable for safe transport to the OR. Primary outcomes were mortality, emergent return to OR, and primary fascial closure (PFC). Trauma operating room charges and OR time were analyzed. One hundred thirty-three BSL were performed on 60 patients with an overall mortality of 23.3 per cent (14/60). There was an average of 2.2 BSL per patient (range 1-8). Indications for BSL were 1) explore/washout (n = 100, 75.2%), 2) decompression (n = 14, 10.5%), 3) infection/abscess (n = 12, 9.0%), 4) hemorrhage (n = 7, 5.3%). Five of 133 BSL (5.8%) were emergently returned to the OR because of perforation or compromised bowel. Trauma OR charges were dollar 5,300 per cases with 2.12 hours per cases. The protocol standardized the conduct of BSL procedure to allow for a low return to OR rate of 5.8 per cent and had an overall in-hospital mortality rate of 23.3 per cent. Primary fascial closure of the abdomen had a significantly reduced hospital stay. BSL allowed trauma OR charges of dollar 5,300 per cases with 2.12 hours per cases savings."

Data on the composition, activity, and billings of a TCC were collected and compared before (January 1, 2002-June 30, 2003) and after (July 1, 2003-December 31, 2003) it assumed the care of all unassigned EGS patients. These included patient volume and demographics, service, procedures, on-call/service activity, and professional billings and collections. Data are means +/- SD or percentages. Intergroup comparisons were performed by using t test or chi2 as appropriate; significance was assumed for values of p < 0.05. Deploying an EGS arm increased coverage weeks (+52 weeks) and necessitated additional staffing (pre-EGS, n = 5; post-EGS, n = 6). Trauma operative volume remained constant (8.2 vs. 10.3 per month), EGS and elective case load increased (28.7 vs. 60 per month; p < 0.01), and the EGS case/consult ratio decreased from 0.81 to 0.64 (p < 0.01). This expanded activity was associated with reduced on-call nonclinical hours, from 3.2 +/- 0.9 to 1.1 +/- 0.8 (p < 0.01), and increased outpatient visits (68.6 vs. 91.1 per month; p < 0.01) and off-service time used for elective operations (22.3 vs. 76%; p < 0.01). Billings significantly increased in each arm compared with the pre-EGS study period (operating room, +44.8; intensive care unit, +12.5; outpatient, +48.7%; p < 0.01). Integrating a full EGS into a TCC service encumbers increased nontrauma unscheduled clinical activity in the operating room, clinic, and floors, which resulted in enhanced billings. These beneficial effects were accrued at the expense of individual time and investment in recruiting additional faculty."

The objective of this report was to evaluate the impact of this new service on CCTS, general surgeons (GS) and the hospital. All admissions to CCTS and GS from July 1, 2000 to June 30, 2003 were reviewed by querying hospital and physician databases for demographics, diagnoses, operative intervention(s), and resource utilization. Data were analyzed using nonparametric methods. [See ]. 9,405 admissions were identified, with GS and EGS admissions increasing over time. In July 2002, EGS became a separate service and captured 26% of GS admissions. Hospital-wide trauma admissions remained stable despite a slight decrease in trauma admissions to CCTS. A decrease in trauma operations by CCTS was offset by an increased EGS operative volume. EGS included \"bread and butter\" GS procedures including appendectomies and cholecystectomies and complex surgical procedures. EGS patients were often sicker with more than 50% requiring ICU admission compared with GS admissions of which only 10% required ICU care.(Table is included in full-text article.) Departmental restructuring to include an EGS service: 1) increased CCTS volume despite decreased CCTS trauma admissions and operations; 2) increased elective GS volume; 3) generated increased use of ICU and operating room resources; and 4) demonstrated that CCTS with broad operative GS backgrounds and critical care knowledge can effectively staff an EGS service."

We reviewed operative logs for 2002 and 2003 at our urban academic Level I trauma center. Six surgeons participate equally in call that covers trauma and nontrauma general surgical, thoracic, and vascular emergencies. Cases were classified as trauma, emergent, urgent, or according to the patient's clinical condition.

We performed 4,082 operations during the study period, of which 8% were trauma, 11% were emergent, 40% were urgent, and 41% were elective. Abdominal and alimentary procedures accounted for 53% of all operations. Vascular, thoracic, and head and neck procedures accounted for 22%, 14%, and 9% of procedures, respectively. To resurrect our discipline, we must reclaim and expand our operative potential and be relieved of our excessive night and weekend burden of serving as housestaff for the neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons, and interventional radiologists. The trauma surgeon can effectively manage trauma and acute care surgery emergencies including thoracic and vascular conditions. Education of the future trauma and acute care surgeon must include specialty training in thoracic and vascular surgery."

Head injuries (n = 1069, 20%) and Non Specific Abdominal pain (NSAP) (n = 855, 16%) made up a third of all emergency surgical admissions. The most common single category of operations were those done on the appendix (n = 348, 15%). The Royal Infirmary, with the only A&E department had more acute surgical admissions (n = 4071) than the Western General Hospital (n = 1275), surgeons in the Royal Infirmary also operated on a much lower percentage of patients (30% v 55%). In the Royal Infirmary, upper gastrointestinal surgeons treated a significantly higher proportion of patients with upper gastro-intestinal and hepatobiliary/pancreatic conditions than either the general or colorectal surgeons and, similarly, the colorectal surgeons treated a higher proportion of patients with colorectal conditions than either the general or upper gastro-intestinal surgeons. The spectrum of emergency admissions and operations in Edinburgh is consistent with previously published data. An A&E department alters the spectrum of diagnoses and, therefore, the overall workload. Specialisation in emergency surgery is already quite advanced. These results all have important implications in future healthcare planning."

One of the leading directions for the field is the integration of emergency general surgery as a wider and more attractive scope of practice. However, there is currently no information on how the addition of an emergency general surgery practice will affect the care of injured patients. We hypothesized that the care of trauma patients would be negatively affected by adding emergency general surgery responsibilities to a trauma service. Our institution underwent a system change in August 2001, where an emergency general surgery (ES) practice was added to an established trauma service. The ES practice included emergency department and in-house consultations for all urgent surgical problems except thoracic and vascular diseases. There were no trauma staff changes during the study period. Trauma registry data (demographics, injuries, injury severity, and procedures) and performance improvement data (peer-review judgments for all identified errors, denied days, audit filters, and deaths) were abstracted for two 15-month periods surrounding this system change. Chi-square, Fisher's exact, and t tests provided between-group comparisons. The trauma staff evaluated a total of 5,874 patients during the 30-month study. There were 1,400 (51%) trauma admissions in the pre-ES group and 1,504 (48%) in the post-ES group, of which 1,278 and 1,434, respectively, met severity criteria for report to our statewide database (Pennsylvania Trauma Outcome Study [PTOS]). There were 163 (12.7% of PTOS) deaths in the pre-ES group compared with 171 (11.9% PTOS) deaths in the post-ES group (p = not significant [NS]). There was one death determined to be preventable by the peer review process for the pre-ES group, and none in the post-ES group. Both groups had 10 potentially preventable deaths, with the remaining mortalities being categorized as nonpreventable (p = NS). Unexpected deaths by TRISS methodology were 36 (2.8%) and 41 (2.9%) for the two groups, respectively (p = NS). There was no difference in the number of provider-specific complications between the groups (23, [1.8%] vs. 19 [1.3%], p = NS). The addition of emergency surgery has resulted in an additional average daily workload of 1.3 cases and 1.2 admissions. Despite an increase in trauma volume over the study period, the addition of emergency surgery to a trauma service did not affect the care of injured patients. The concept of adding emergency surgery responsibilities to trauma surgeons appears to be a valid way to increase operative experience without compromising care of the injured patient."

Operations for trauma decreased in 2002 compared with 1999, despite a higher number of penetrating injuries and total trauma contacts. Nontrauma general surgery operations performed by trauma faculty increased in proportion to coverage provided by the trauma service. In 2002, 57% of all cases performed by trauma surgeons were emergency general surgery, which accounted for 32% to 74% of an individual surgeon's caseload. In anonymously completed Web-based questionnaires, current trauma faculty expressed satisfaction with the combined trauma and emergency general surgery model. The combined trauma and nontrauma surgery service increased operative caseloads and improved satisfaction of trauma surgeons. A comprehensive trauma and emergency general surgery service may be an attractive model for the future of trauma surgery and provide logistical and medical advantages to the emergency general surgery patient population."

    "abstract": "A prospective audit of emergency soft-tissue surgery for an eight-week period revealed that general surgical emergency operations were more than twice as common as those undertaken in other soft-tissue specialties. The audit reveals that emergency general surgery needs an increase in resources, an increase in available staff and an increase in the role of the consultant general surgeon on call. An alternative solution would be to admit soft-tissue emergencies by specialty and develop specialist emergency services."

    "abstract": "Following the introduction of a dedicated 24-hour emergency theatre facility in a 500-bed district general hospital, the total amount of emergency general surgery performed after 22.00 hours has been reduced from 37.2 to 13.1%, with a concomitant increase in emergency day-time operating from 22.1 to 51.2%. The majority of the workload was previously performed by the junior grades, and this has remained unchanged. Operative experience has not been diminished with the reduction in night-time surgery, and senior supervision has been enhanced. There has been no significant difference in mortality or morbidity with the changes in operating patterns. Utilization of the theatre staff and time during the night has been improved."

    "title": "Training experience of doctors certificated for general practice in 1985-90.",
    "abstract": "The computerized records held by the Joint Committee on Postgraduate Training for General Practice have been reviewed to determine the post-registration experience offered by doctors who were issued with a joint committee certificate during the years 1985-90, inclusive. The percentage of certificates issued on the basis of experience prescribed in the vocational training regulations rose from 74.4% in 1985 to 89.7% in 1990. Since 1985 obstetrics/gynaecology has been the specialty in which the greatest number of successful applicants have offered experience, increasing from 86.4% in 1985 to 93.8% in 1990. The next most popular specialty was accident and emergency/general surgery (offered by 65.5% of successful applicants in 1985 and 73.6% in 1990) followed by paediatrics (56.7% in 1985 and 62.2% in 1990). The percentage of certificates issued on the basis of experience in geriatric medicine rose slowly from 35.6% in 1985 to 41.7% in 1990, for psychiatry the figures were similar (36.4% in 1985 and 40.7% in 1990), and for general medicine there was a slight decrease (46.2% in 1985 and 44.7% in 1990). There is a need for more doctors to acquire experience in general medicine, geriatric medicine and psychiatry. Since 1985, the trend has been for applicants to offer a more broadly based range of experience. In 1985, 48.5% of successful applicants offered experience in four hospital specialties and this rose to 63.6% in 1990. Although the vocational training regulations offer a degree of flexibility only a small number of successful applicants have taken advantage of this.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

    "abstract": "In a prospective randomized controlled study on postoperative thromboembolism, 259 patients undergoing elective general surgery, emergency general surgery, total hip replacement or hip fracture surgery were given thromboembolic prophylaxis with either a combination of dextran 70 and dihydroergotamine (DHE) or with dextran 70 alone. 500 ml dextran 70 was infused twice on the day of operation, once on postoperative days 1 and 3, and also on day 5 if the patient was still confined to bed. 0.5 mg DHE was given s.c. twice daily starting before operation and continued for 3 or 5 postoperative days. In hip fracture patients prophylaxis was started as soon as the diagnosis was made. 500 ml dextran 70 was given every other day before operation. DHE was given twice daily if so indicated from randomization. The patients were screened for deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) with the 125I-labelled fibrinogen test for 8 days and followed for one month postoperatively. In hip fracture surgery the incidence of DVT was significantly reduced by the combination of dextran 70 and DHE compared to dextran 70 alone (1/32 vs. 11/36, P = 0.003). However, this synergistic effect of DHE could not be detected in the other patient groups. Fatal pulmonary embolism did not occur. No severe side effects attributable to prophylaxis were noted in either group."

    "abstract": "A review of twelve years surgical practice in a district in the North East of England is presented. During this period 63 562 surgical operations were undertaken. Analyses of these operations show that the amount of elective general surgery undertaken has almost doubled and the rate of emergency general surgery has remained remarkably constant. There has been a significant increase in the number of gallbladder, varicose vein and minor general surgical procedures performed. There has also been a significant increase in urological surgery and in orthopaedic surgery which has doubled over the study period."
